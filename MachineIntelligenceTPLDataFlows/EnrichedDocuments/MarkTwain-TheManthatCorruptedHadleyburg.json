Hadleyburg was the most honest and upright town\r\nin all the region round about.  It had kept that reputation unsmirched\r\nduring three generations, and was prouder of it than of any other of its\r\npossessions.  It was so proud of it, and so anxious to insure its\r\nperpetuation, that it began to teach the principles of honest dealing to\r\nits babies in the cradle, and made the like teachings the staple of their\r\nculture thenceforward through all the years devoted to their education.\r\nAlso, throughout the formative years temptations were kept out of the way\r\nof the young people, so that their honesty could have every chance to\r\nharden and solidify, and become a part of their very bone.  The\r\nneighbouring towns were jealous of this honourable supremacy, and\r\naffected to sneer at Hadleyburg's pride in it and call it vanity; but all\r\nthe same they were obliged to acknowledge that Hadleyburg was in reality\r\nan incorruptible town; and if pressed they would also acknowledge that\r\nthe mere fact that a young man hailed from Hadleyburg was all the\r\nrecommendation he needed when he went forth from his natal town to seek\r\nfor responsible employment.\r\n\r\nBut at last, in the drift of time, Hadleyburg had the ill luck to offend\r\na passing stranger--possibly without knowing it, certainly without\r\ncaring, for Hadleyburg was sufficient unto itself, and cared not a rap\r\nfor strangers or their opinions.  Still, it would have been well to make\r\nan exception in this one's case, for he was a bitter man, and revengeful.\r\nAll through his wanderings during a whole year he kept his injury in\r\nmind, and gave all his leisure moments to trying to invent a compensating\r\nsatisfaction for it.  He contrived many plans, and all of them were good,\r\nbut none of them was quite sweeping enough: the poorest of them would\r\nhurt a great many individuals, but what he wanted was a plan which would\r\ncomprehend the entire town, and not let so much as one person escape\r\nunhurt.  At last he had a fortunate idea, and when it fell into his brain\r\nit lit up his whole head with an evil joy.  He began to form a plan at\r\nonce, saying to himself \"That is the thing to do--I will corrupt the\r\ntown.\"\r\n\r\nSix months later he went to Hadleyburg, and arrived in a buggy at the\r\nhouse of the old cashier of the bank about ten at night.  He got a sack\r\nout of the buggy, shouldered it, and staggered with it through the\r\ncottage yard, and knocked at the door.  A woman's voice said \"Come in,\"\r\nand he entered, and set his sack behind the stove in the parlour, saying\r\npolitely to the old lady who sat reading the \"Missionary Herald\" by the\r\nlamp:\r\n\r\n\"Pray keep your seat, madam, I will not disturb you.  There--now it is\r\npretty well concealed; one would hardly know it was there.  Can I see\r\nyour husband a moment, madam?\"\r\n\r\nNo, he was gone to Brixton, and might not return before morning.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, madam, it is no matter.  I merely wanted to leave that sack\r\nin his care, to be delivered to the rightful owner when he shall be\r\nfound.  I am a stranger; he does not know me; I am merely passing through\r\nthe town to-night to discharge a matter which has been long in my mind.\r\nMy errand is now completed, and I go pleased and a little proud, and you\r\nwill never see me again.  There is a paper attached to the sack which\r\nwill explain everything.  Good-night, madam.\"\r\n\r\nThe old lady was afraid of the mysterious big stranger, and was glad to\r\nsee him go.  But her curiosity was roused, and she went straight to the\r\nsack and brought away the paper.  It began as follows:\r\n\r\n   \"TO BE PUBLISHED, or, the right man sought out by private\r\n   inquiry--either will answer.  This sack contains gold coin weighing a\r\n   hundred and sixty pounds four ounces--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy on us, and the door not locked!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Richards flew to it all in a tremble and locked it, then pulled down\r\nthe window-shades and stood frightened, worried, and wondering if there\r\nwas anything else she could do toward making herself and the money more\r\nsafe.  She listened awhile for burglars, then surrendered to curiosity,\r\nand went back to the lamp and finished reading the paper:\r\n\r\n   \"I am a foreigner, and am presently going back to my own country, to\r\n   remain there permanently.  I am grateful to America for what I have\r\n   received at her hands during my long stay under her flag; and to one\r\n   of her citizens--a citizen of Hadleyburg--I am especially grateful for\r\n   a great kindness done me a year or two ago.  Two great kindnesses in\r\n   fact.  I will explain.  I was a gambler.  I say I WAS.  I was a ruined\r\n   gambler.  I arrived in this village at night, hungry and without a\r\n   penny.  I asked for help--in the dark; I was ashamed to beg in the\r\n   light.  I begged of the right man.  He gave me twenty dollars--that is\r\n   to say, he gave me life, as I considered it.  He also gave me fortune;\r\n   for out of that money I have made myself rich at the gaming-table.  And\r\n   finally, a remark which he made to me has remained with me to this\r\n   day, and has at last conquered me; and in conquering has saved the\r\n   remnant of my morals: I shall gamble no more.  Now I have no idea who\r\n   that man was, but I want him found, and I want him to have this money,\r\n   to give away, throw away, or keep, as he pleases.  It is merely my way\r\n   of testifying my gratitude to him.  If I could stay, I would find him\r\n   myself; but no matter, he will be found.  This is an honest town, an\r\n   incorruptible town, and I know I can trust it without fear.  This man\r\n   can be identified by the remark which he made to me; I feel persuaded\r\n   that he will remember it.\r\n\r\n   \"And now my plan is this: If you prefer to conduct the inquiry\r\n   privately, do so.  Tell the contents of this present writing to any\r\n   one who is likely to be the right man.  If he shall answer, 'I am the\r\n   man; the remark I made was so-and-so,' apply the test--to wit: open\r\n   the sack, and in it you will find a sealed envelope containing that\r\n   remark.  If the remark mentioned by the candidate tallies with it,\r\n   give him the money, and ask no further questions, for he is certainly\r\n   the right man.\r\n\r\n   \"But if you shall prefer a public inquiry, then publish this present\r\n   writing in the local paper--with these instructions added, to wit:\r\n   Thirty days from now, let the candidate appear at the town-hall at\r\n   eight in the evening (Friday), and hand his remark, in a sealed\r\n   envelope, to the Rev. Mr. Burgess (if he will be kind enough to act);\r\n   and let Mr. Burgess there and then destroy the seals of the sack, open\r\n   it, and see if the remark is correct: if correct, let the money be\r\n   delivered, with my sincere gratitude, to my benefactor thus\r\n   identified.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Richards sat down, gently quivering with excitement, and was soon\r\nlost in thinkings--after this pattern: \"What a strange thing it is! . . .\r\nAnd what a fortune for that kind man who set his bread afloat upon the\r\nwaters! . . . If it had only been my husband that did it!--for we are so\r\npoor, so old and poor! . . .\"  Then, with a sigh--\"But it was not my\r\nEdward; no, it was not he that gave a stranger twenty dollars.  It is a\r\npity too; I see it now. . . \"  Then, with a shudder--\"But it is\r\n_gamblers_' money! the wages of sin; we couldn't take it; we couldn't\r\ntouch it.  I don't like to be near it; it seems a defilement.\"  She moved\r\nto a farther chair. . . \"I wish Edward would come, and take it to the\r\nbank; a burglar might come at any moment; it is dreadful to be here all\r\nalone with it.\"\r\n\r\nAt eleven Mr. Richards arrived, and while his wife was saying \"I am _so_\r\nglad you've come!\" he was saying, \"I am so tired--tired clear out; it is\r\ndreadful to be poor, and have to make these dismal journeys at my time of\r\nlife.  Always at the grind, grind, grind, on a salary--another man's\r\nslave, and he sitting at home in his slippers, rich and comfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so sorry for you, Edward, you know that; but be comforted; we have\r\nour livelihood; we have our good name--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mary, and that is everything.  Don't mind my talk--it's just a\r\nmoment's irritation and doesn't mean anything.  Kiss me--there, it's all\r\ngone now, and I am not complaining any more.  What have you been getting?\r\nWhat's in the sack?\"\r\n\r\nThen his wife told him the great secret.  It dazed him for a moment; then\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"It weighs a hundred and sixty pounds?  Why, Mary, it's for-ty thou-sand\r\ndollars--think of it--a whole fortune!  Not ten men in this village are\r\nworth that much.  Give me the paper.\"\r\n\r\nHe skimmed through it and said:\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it an adventure!  Why, it's a romance; it's like the impossible\r\nthings one reads about in books, and never sees in life.\"  He was well\r\nstirred up now; cheerful, even gleeful.  He tapped his old wife on the\r\ncheek, and said humorously, \"Why, we're rich, Mary, rich; all we've got\r\nto do is to bury the money and burn the papers.  If the gambler ever\r\ncomes to inquire, we'll merely look coldly upon him and say: 'What is\r\nthis nonsense you are talking?  We have never heard of you and your sack\r\nof gold before;' and then he would look foolish, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And in the meantime, while you are running on with your jokes, the money\r\nis still here, and it is fast getting along toward burglar-time.\"\r\n\r\n\"True.  Very well, what shall we do--make the inquiry private?  No, not\r\nthat; it would spoil the romance.  The public method is better.  Think\r\nwhat a noise it will make!  And it will make all the other towns jealous;\r\nfor no stranger would trust such a thing to any town but Hadleyburg, and\r\nthey know it.  It's a great card for us.  I must get to the\r\nprinting-office now, or I shall be too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"But stop--stop--don't leave me here alone with it, Edward!\"\r\n\r\nBut he was gone.  For only a little while, however.  Not far from his own\r\nhouse he met the editor--proprietor of the paper, and gave him the\r\ndocument, and said \"Here is a good thing for you, Cox--put it in.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be too late, Mr. Richards, but I'll see.\"\r\n\r\nAt home again, he and his wife sat down to talk the charming mystery\r\nover; they were in no condition for sleep.  The first question was, Who\r\ncould the citizen have been who gave the stranger the twenty dollars?  It\r\nseemed a simple one; both answered it in the same breath--\r\n\r\n\"Barclay Goodson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Richards, \"he could have done it, and it would have been like\r\nhim, but there's not another in the town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody will grant that, Edward--grant it privately, anyway.  For six\r\nmonths, now, the village has been its own proper self once more--honest,\r\nnarrow, self-righteous, and stingy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is what he always called it, to the day of his death--said it right\r\nout publicly, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and he was hated for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course; but he didn't care.  I reckon he was the best-hated man\r\namong us, except the Reverend Burgess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Burgess deserves it--he will never get another congregation here.\r\nMean as the town is, it knows how to estimate _him_.  Edward, doesn't it\r\nseem odd that the stranger should appoint Burgess to deliver the money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes--it does.  That is--that is--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so much that-_is_-ing?  Would _you_ select him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary, maybe the stranger knows him better than this village does.\"\r\n\r\n\"Much _that_ would help Burgess!\"\r\n\r\nThe husband seemed perplexed for an answer; the wife kept a steady eye\r\nupon him, and waited.  Finally Richards said, with the hesitancy of one\r\nwho is making a statement which is likely to encounter doubt,\r\n\r\n\"Mary, Burgess is not a bad man.\"\r\n\r\nHis wife was certainly surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"He is not a bad man.  I know.  The whole of his unpopularity had its\r\nfoundation in that one thing--the thing that made so much noise.\"\r\n\r\n\"That 'one thing,' indeed!  As if that 'one thing' wasn't enough, all by\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty.  Plenty.  Only he wasn't guilty of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How you talk!  Not guilty of it!  Everybody knows he _was_ guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary, I give you my word--he was innocent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't believe it and I don't.  How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a confession.  I am ashamed, but I will make it.  I was the only\r\nman who knew he was innocent.  I could have saved him, and--and--well,\r\nyou know how the town was wrought up--I hadn't the pluck to do it.  It\r\nwould have turned everybody against me.  I felt mean, ever so mean; ut I\r\ndidn't dare; I hadn't the manliness to face that.\"\r\n\r\nMary looked troubled, and for a while was silent.  Then she said\r\nstammeringly:\r\n\r\n\"I--I don't think it would have done for you to--to--One\r\nmustn't--er--public opinion--one has to be so careful--so--\"  It was a\r\ndifficult road, and she got mired; but after a little she got started\r\nagain.  \"It was a great pity, but--Why, we couldn't afford it, Edward--we\r\ncouldn't indeed.  Oh, I wouldn't have had you do it for anything!\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have lost us the good-will of so many people, Mary; and\r\nthen--and then--\"\r\n\r\n\"What troubles me now is, what _he_ thinks of us, Edward.\"\r\n\r\n\"He?  _He_ doesn't suspect that I could have saved him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed the wife, in a tone of relief, \"I am glad of that.  As\r\nlong as he doesn't know that you could have saved him, he--he--well that\r\nmakes it a great deal better.  Why, I might have known he didn't know,\r\nbecause he is always trying to be friendly with us, as little\r\nencouragement as we give him.  More than once people have twitted me with\r\nit.  There's the Wilsons, and the Wilcoxes, and the Harknesses, they take\r\na mean pleasure in saying '_Your friend_ Burgess,' because they know it\r\npesters me.  I wish he wouldn't persist in liking us so; I can't think\r\nwhy he keeps it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can explain it.  It's another confession.  When the thing was new and\r\nhot, and the town made a plan to ride him on a rail, my conscience hurt\r\nme so that I couldn't stand it, and I went privately and gave him notice,\r\nand he got out of the town and stayed out till it was safe to come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Edward!  If the town had found it out--\"\r\n\r\n\"_Don't_!  It scares me yet, to think of it.  I repented of it the minute\r\nit was done; and I was even afraid to tell you lest your face might\r\nbetray it to somebody.  I didn't sleep any that night, for worrying.  But\r\nafter a few days I saw that no one was going to suspect me, and after\r\nthat I got to feeling glad I did it.  And I feel glad yet, Mary--glad\r\nthrough and through.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I, now, for it would have been a dreadful way to treat him.  Yes,\r\nI'm glad; for really you did owe him that, you know.  But, Edward,\r\nsuppose it should come out yet, some day!\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because everybody thinks it was Goodson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they would!\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.  And of course _he_ didn't care.  They persuaded poor old\r\nSawlsberry to go and charge it on him, and he went blustering over there\r\nand did it.  Goodson looked him over, like as if he was hunting for a\r\nplace on him that he could despise the most; then he says, 'So you are\r\nthe Committee of Inquiry, are you?'  Sawlsberry said that was about what\r\nhe was.  'H'm.  Do they require particulars, or do you reckon a kind of a\r\n_general_ answer will do?'  'If they require particulars, I will come\r\nback, Mr. Goodson; I will take the general answer first.'  'Very well,\r\nthen, tell them to go to hell--I reckon that's general enough.  And I'll\r\ngive you some advice, Sawlsberry; when you come back for the particulars,\r\nfetch a basket to carry what is left of yourself home in.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Just like Goodson; it's got all the marks.  He had only one vanity; he\r\nthought he could give advice better than any other person.\"\r\n\r\n\"It settled the business, and saved us, Mary.  The subject was dropped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless you, I'm not doubting _that_.\"\r\n\r\nThen they took up the gold-sack mystery again, with strong interest.  Soon\r\nthe conversation began to suffer breaks--interruptions caused by absorbed\r\nthinkings.  The breaks grew more and more frequent.  At last Richards\r\nlost himself wholly in thought.  He sat long, gazing vacantly at the\r\nfloor, and by-and-by he began to punctuate his thoughts with little\r\nnervous movements of his hands that seemed to indicate vexation.  Meantime\r\nhis wife too had relapsed into a thoughtful silence, and her movements\r\nwere beginning to show a troubled discomfort.  Finally Richards got up\r\nand strode aimlessly about the room, ploughing his hands through his\r\nhair, much as a somnambulist might do who was having a bad dream.  Then\r\nhe seemed to arrive at a definite purpose; and without a word he put on\r\nhis hat and passed quickly out of the house.  His wife sat brooding, with\r\na drawn face, and did not seem to be aware that she was alone.  Now and\r\nthen she murmured, \"Lead us not into t . . . but--but--we are so poor, so\r\npoor! . . . Lead us not into . . . Ah, who would be hurt by it?--and no\r\none would ever know . . . Lead us . . . \"  The voice died out in\r\nmumblings.  After a little she glanced up and muttered in a\r\nhalf-frightened, half-glad way--\r\n\r\n\"He is gone!  But, oh dear, he may be too late--too late . . . Maybe\r\nnot--maybe there is still time.\"  She rose and stood thinking, nervously\r\nclasping and unclasping her hands.  A slight shudder shook her frame, and\r\nshe said, out of a dry throat, \"God forgive me--it's awful to think such\r\nthings--but . . . Lord, how we are made--how strangely we are made!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned the light low, and slipped stealthily over and knelt down by\r\nthe sack and felt of its ridgy sides with her hands, and fondled them\r\nlovingly; and there was a gloating light in her poor old eyes.  She fell\r\ninto fits of absence; and came half out of them at times to mutter \"If we\r\nhad only waited!--oh, if we had only waited a little, and not been in\r\nsuch a hurry!\"\r\n\r\nMeantime Cox had gone home from his office and told his wife all about\r\nthe strange thing that had happened, and they had talked it over eagerly,\r\nand guessed that the late Goodson was the only man in the town who could\r\nhave helped a suffering stranger with so noble a sum as twenty dollars.\r\nThen there was a pause, and the two became thoughtful and silent.  And by-\r\nand-by nervous and fidgety.  At last the wife said, as if to herself,\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows this secret but the Richardses . . . and us . . . nobody.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband came out of his thinkings with a slight start, and gazed\r\nwistfully at his wife, whose face was become very pale; then he\r\nhesitatingly rose, and glanced furtively at his hat, then at his wife--a\r\nsort of mute inquiry.  Mrs. Cox swallowed once or twice, with her hand at\r\nher throat, then in place of speech she nodded her head.  In a moment she\r\nwas alone, and mumbling to herself.\r\n\r\nAnd now Richards and Cox were hurrying through the deserted streets, from\r\nopposite directions.  They met, panting, at the foot of the\r\nprinting-office stairs; by the night-light there they read each other's\r\nface.  Cox whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows about this but us?\"\r\n\r\nThe whispered answer was:\r\n\r\n\"Not a soul--on honour, not a soul!\"\r\n\r\n\"If it isn't too late to--\"\r\n\r\nThe men were starting up-stairs; at this moment they were overtaken by a\r\nboy, and Cox asked,\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Johnny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't ship the early mail--nor _any_ mail; wait till I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's already gone, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Gone_?\"  It had the sound of an unspeakable disappointment in it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.  Time-table for Brixton and all the towns beyond changed to-\r\nday, sir--had to get the papers in twenty minutes earlier than common.  I\r\nhad to rush; if I had been two minutes later--\"\r\n\r\nThe men turned and walked slowly away, not waiting to hear the rest.\r\nNeither of them spoke during ten minutes; then Cox said, in a vexed tone,\r\n\r\n\"What possessed you to be in such a hurry, _I_ can't make out.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was humble enough:\r\n\r\n\"I see it now, but somehow I never thought, you know, until it was too\r\nlate.  But the next time--\"\r\n\r\n\"Next time be hanged!  It won't come in a thousand years.\"\r\n\r\nThen the friends separated without a good-night, and dragged themselves\r\nhome with the gait of mortally stricken men.  At their homes their wives\r\nsprang up with an eager \"Well?\"--then saw the answer with their eyes and\r\nsank down sorrowing, without waiting for it to come in words.  In both\r\nhouses a discussion followed of a heated sort--a new thing; there had\r\nbeen discussions before, but not heated ones, not ungentle ones.  The\r\ndiscussions to-night were a sort of seeming plagiarisms of each other.\r\nMrs. Richards said:\r\n\r\n\"If you had only waited, Edward--if you had only stopped to think; but\r\nno, you must run straight to the printing-office and spread it all over\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\n\"It _said_ publish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is nothing; it also said do it privately, if you liked.  There,\r\nnow--is that true, or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes--yes, it is true; but when I thought what a stir it would make,\r\nand what a compliment it was to Hadleyburg that a stranger should trust\r\nit so--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly, I know all that; but if you had only stopped to think,\r\nyou would have seen that you _couldn't_ find the right man, because he is\r\nin his grave, and hasn't left chick nor child nor relation behind him;\r\nand as long as the money went to somebody that awfully needed it, and\r\nnobody would be hurt by it, and--and--\"\r\n\r\nShe broke down, crying.  Her husband tried to think of some comforting\r\nthing to say, and presently came out with this:\r\n\r\n\"But after all, Mary, it must be for the best--it must be; we know that.\r\nAnd we must remember that it was so ordered--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ordered!  Oh, everything's _ordered_, when a person has to find some way\r\nout when he has been stupid. Just the same, it was _ordered_ that the\r\nmoney should come to us in this special way, and it was you that must\r\ntake it on yourself to go meddling with the designs of Providence--and\r\nwho gave you the right?  It was wicked, that is what it was--just\r\nblasphemous presumption, and no more becoming to a meek and humble\r\nprofessor of--\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mary, you know how we have been trained all our lives long, like\r\nthe whole village, till it is absolutely second nature to us to stop not\r\na single moment to think when there's an honest thing to be done--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know it, I know it--it's been one everlasting training and\r\ntraining and training in honesty--honesty shielded, from the very cradle,\r\nagainst every possible temptation, and so it's _artificial_ honesty, and\r\nweak as water when temptation comes, as we have seen this night.  God\r\nknows I never had shade nor shadow of a doubt of my petrified and\r\nindestructible honesty until now--and now, under the very first big and\r\nreal temptation, I--Edward, it is my belief that this town's honesty is\r\nas rotten as mine is; as rotten as yours.  It is a mean town, a hard,\r\nstingy town, and hasn't a virtue in the world but this honesty it is so\r\ncelebrated for and so conceited about; and so help me, I do believe that\r\nif ever the day comes that its honesty falls under great temptation, its\r\ngrand reputation will go to ruin like a house of cards.  There, now, I've\r\nmade confession, and I feel better; I am a humbug, and I've been one all\r\nmy life, without knowing it.  Let no man call me honest again--I will not\r\nhave it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--Well, Mary, I feel a good deal as you do: I certainly do.  It seems\r\nstrange, too, so strange.  I never could have believed it--never.\"\r\n\r\nA long silence followed; both were sunk in thought.  At last the wife\r\nlooked up and said:\r\n\r\n\"I know what you are thinking, Edward.\"\r\n\r\nRichards had the embarrassed look of a person who is caught.\r\n\r\n\"I am ashamed to confess it, Mary, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no matter, Edward, I was thinking the same question myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so.  State it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were thinking, if a body could only guess out _what the remark was_\r\nthat Goodson made to the stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's perfectly true.  I feel guilty and ashamed.  And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm past it.  Let us make a pallet here; we've got to stand watch till\r\nthe bank vault opens in the morning and admits the sack. . . Oh dear, oh\r\ndear--if we hadn't made the mistake!\"\r\n\r\nThe pallet was made, and Mary said:\r\n\r\n\"The open sesame--what could it have been?  I do wonder what that remark\r\ncould have been.  But come; we will get to bed now.\"\r\n\r\n\"And sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; think.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the Coxes too had completed their spat and their\r\nreconciliation, and were turning in--to think, to think, and toss, and\r\nfret, and worry over what the remark could possibly have been which\r\nGoodson made to the stranded derelict; that golden remark; that remark\r\nworth forty thousand dollars, cash.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the village telegraph-office was open later than usual\r\nthat night was this: The foreman of Cox's paper was the local\r\nrepresentative of the Associated Press.  One might say its honorary\r\nrepresentative, for it wasn't four times a year that he could furnish\r\nthirty words that would be accepted.  But this time it was different.  His\r\ndespatch stating what he had caught got an instant answer:\r\n\r\n   \"Send the whole thing--all the details--twelve hundred words.\"\r\n\r\nA colossal order!  The foreman filled the bill; and he was the proudest\r\nman in the State.  By breakfast-time the next morning the name of\r\nHadleyburg the Incorruptible was on every lip in America, from Montreal\r\nto the Gulf, from the glaciers of Alaska to the orange-groves of Florida;\r\nand millions and millions of people were discussing the stranger and his\r\nmoney-sack, and wondering if the right man would be found, and hoping\r\nsome more news about the matter would come soon--right away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHadleyburg village woke up world-celebrated--astonished--happy--vain.\r\nVain beyond imagination.  Its nineteen principal citizens and their wives\r\nwent about shaking hands with each other, and beaming, and smiling, and\r\ncongratulating, and saying _this_ thing adds a new word to the\r\ndictionary--_Hadleyburg_, synonym for _incorruptible_--destined to live\r\nin dictionaries for ever!  And the minor and unimportant citizens and\r\ntheir wives went around acting in much the same way.  Everybody ran to\r\nthe bank to see the gold-sack; and before noon grieved and envious crowds\r\nbegan to flock in from Brixton and all neighbouring towns; and that\r\nafternoon and next day reporters began to arrive from everywhere to\r\nverify the sack and its history and write the whole thing up anew, and\r\nmake dashing free-hand pictures of the sack, and of Richards's house, and\r\nthe bank, and the Presbyterian church, and the Baptist church, and the\r\npublic square, and the town-hall where the test would be applied and the\r\nmoney delivered; and damnable portraits of the Richardses, and Pinkerton\r\nthe banker, and Cox, and the foreman, and Reverend Burgess, and the\r\npostmaster--and even of Jack Halliday, who was the loafing, good-natured,\r\nno-account, irreverent fisherman, hunter, boys' friend, stray-dogs'\r\nfriend, typical \"Sam Lawson\" of the town.  The little mean, smirking,\r\noily Pinkerton showed the sack to all comers, and rubbed his sleek palms\r\ntogether pleasantly, and enlarged upon the town's fine old reputation for\r\nhonesty and upon this wonderful endorsement of it, and hoped and believed\r\nthat the example would now spread far and wide over the American world,\r\nand be epoch-making in the matter of moral regeneration.  And so on, and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nBy the end of a week things had quieted down again; the wild intoxication\r\nof pride and joy had sobered to a soft, sweet, silent delight--a sort of\r\ndeep, nameless, unutterable content.  All faces bore a look of peaceful,\r\nholy happiness.\r\n\r\nThen a change came.  It was a gradual change; so gradual that its\r\nbeginnings were hardly noticed; maybe were not noticed at all, except by\r\nJack Halliday, who always noticed everything; and always made fun of it,\r\ntoo, no matter what it was.  He began to throw out chaffing remarks about\r\npeople not looking quite so happy as they did a day or two ago; and next\r\nhe claimed that the new aspect was deepening to positive sadness; next,\r\nthat it was taking on a sick look; and finally he said that everybody was\r\nbecome so moody, thoughtful, and absent-minded that he could rob the\r\nmeanest man in town of a cent out of the bottom of his breeches pocket\r\nand not disturb his reverie.\r\n\r\nAt this stage--or at about this stage--a saying like this was dropped at\r\nbedtime--with a sigh, usually--by the head of each of the nineteen\r\nprincipal households:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, what _could_ have been the remark that Goodson made?\"\r\n\r\nAnd straightway--with a shudder--came this, from the man's wife:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _don't_!  What horrible thing are you mulling in your mind?  Put it\r\naway from you, for God's sake!\"\r\n\r\nBut that question was wrung from those men again the next night--and got\r\nthe same retort.  But weaker.\r\n\r\nAnd the third night the men uttered the question yet again--with anguish,\r\nand absently.  This time--and the following night--the wives fidgeted\r\nfeebly, and tried to say something.  But didn't.\r\n\r\nAnd the night after that they found their tongues and\r\nresponded--longingly:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if we _could_ only guess!\"\r\n\r\nHalliday's comments grew daily more and more sparklingly disagreeable and\r\ndisparaging.  He went diligently about, laughing at the town,\r\nindividually and in mass.  But his laugh was the only one left in the\r\nvillage: it fell upon a hollow and mournful vacancy and emptiness.  Not\r\neven a smile was findable anywhere.  Halliday carried a cigar-box around\r\non a tripod, playing that it was a camera, and halted all passers and\r\naimed the thing and said \"Ready!--now look pleasant, please,\" but not\r\neven this capital joke could surprise the dreary faces into any\r\nsoftening.\r\n\r\nSo three weeks passed--one week was left.  It was Saturday evening after\r\nsupper.  Instead of the aforetime Saturday-evening flutter and bustle and\r\nshopping and larking, the streets were empty and desolate.  Richards and\r\nhis old wife sat apart in their little parlour--miserable and thinking.\r\nThis was become their evening habit now: the life-long habit which had\r\npreceded it, of reading, knitting, and contented chat, or receiving or\r\npaying neighbourly calls, was dead and gone and forgotten, ages ago--two\r\nor three weeks ago; nobody talked now, nobody read, nobody visited--the\r\nwhole village sat at home, sighing, worrying, silent.  Trying to guess\r\nout that remark.\r\n\r\nThe postman left a letter.  Richards glanced listlessly at the\r\nsuperscription and the post-mark--unfamiliar, both--and tossed the letter\r\non the table and resumed his might-have-beens and his hopeless dull\r\nmiseries where he had left them off.  Two or three hours later his wife\r\ngot wearily up and was going away to bed without a good-night--custom\r\nnow--but she stopped near the letter and eyed it awhile with a dead\r\ninterest, then broke it open, and began to skim it over.  Richards,\r\nsitting there with his chair tilted back against the wall and his chin\r\nbetween his knees, heard something fall.  It was his wife.  He sprang to\r\nher side, but she cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Leave me alone, I am too happy.  Read the letter--read it!\"\r\n\r\nHe did.  He devoured it, his brain reeling.  The letter was from a\r\ndistant State, and it said:\r\n\r\n   \"I am a stranger to you, but no matter: I have something to tell.  I\r\n   have just arrived home from Mexico, and learned about that episode.  Of\r\n   course you do not know who made that remark, but I know, and I am the\r\n   only person living who does know.  It was GOODSON.  I knew him well,\r\n   many years ago.  I passed through your village that very night, and\r\n   was his guest till the midnight train came along.  I overheard him\r\n   make that remark to the stranger in the dark--it was in Hale Alley.  He\r\n   and I talked of it the rest of the way home, and while smoking in his\r\n   house.  He mentioned many of your villagers in the course of his\r\n   talk--most of them in a very uncomplimentary way, but two or three\r\n   favourably: among these latter yourself.  I say 'favourably'--nothing\r\n   stronger.  I remember his saying he did not actually LIKE any person\r\n   in the town--not one; but that you--I THINK he said you--am almost\r\n   sure--had done him a very great service once, possibly without knowing\r\n   the full value of it, and he wished he had a fortune, he would leave\r\n   it to you when he died, and a curse apiece for the rest of the\r\n   citizens.  Now, then, if it was you that did him that service, you are\r\n   his legitimate heir, and entitled to the sack of gold.  I know that I\r\n   can trust to your honour and honesty, for in a citizen of Hadleyburg\r\n   these virtues are an unfailing inheritance, and so I am going to\r\n   reveal to you the remark, well satisfied that if you are not the right\r\n   man you will seek and find the right one and see that poor Goodson's\r\n   debt of gratitude for the service referred to is paid.  This is the\r\n   remark 'YOU ARE FAR FROM BEING A BAD MAN: GO, AND REFORM.'\r\n\r\n   \"HOWARD L. STEPHENSON.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Edward, the money is ours, and I am so grateful, _oh_, so\r\ngrateful,--kiss me, dear, it's for ever since we kissed--and we needed it\r\nso--the money--and now you are free of Pinkerton and his bank, and\r\nnobody's slave any more; it seems to me I could fly for joy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a happy half-hour that the couple spent there on the settee\r\ncaressing each other; it was the old days come again--days that had begun\r\nwith their courtship and lasted without a break till the stranger brought\r\nthe deadly money.  By-and-by the wife said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Edward, how lucky it was you did him that grand service, poor\r\nGoodson!  I never liked him, but I love him now.  And it was fine and\r\nbeautiful of you never to mention it or brag about it.\"  Then, with a\r\ntouch of reproach, \"But you ought to have told _me_, Edward, you ought to\r\nhave told your wife, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I--er--well, Mary, you see--\"\r\n\r\n\"Now stop hemming and hawing, and tell me about it, Edward.  I always\r\nloved you, and now I'm proud of you.  Everybody believes there was only\r\none good generous soul in this village, and now it turns out that\r\nyou--Edward, why don't you tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--er--er--Why, Mary, I can't!\"\r\n\r\n\"You _can't_?  _Why_ can't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, he--well, he--he made me promise I wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\nThe wife looked him over, and said, very slowly:\r\n\r\n\"Made--you--promise?  Edward, what do you tell me that for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary, do you think I would lie?\"\r\n\r\nShe was troubled and silent for a moment, then she laid her hand within\r\nhis and said:\r\n\r\n\"No . . . no.  We have wandered far enough from our bearings--God spare\r\nus that!  In all your life you have never uttered a lie.  But now--now\r\nthat the foundations of things seem to be crumbling from under us,\r\nwe--we--\"  She lost her voice for a moment, then said, brokenly, \"Lead us\r\nnot into temptation. . . I think you made the promise, Edward.  Let it\r\nrest so.  Let us keep away from that ground.  Now--that is all gone by;\r\nlet us he happy again; it is no time for clouds.\"\r\n\r\nEdward found it something of an effort to comply, for his mind kept\r\nwandering--trying to remember what the service was that he had done\r\nGoodson.\r\n\r\nThe couple lay awake the most of the night, Mary happy and busy, Edward\r\nbusy, but not so happy.  Mary was planning what she would do with the\r\nmoney.  Edward was trying to recall that service.  At first his\r\nconscience was sore on account of the lie he had told Mary--if it was a\r\nlie.  After much reflection--suppose it _was_ a lie?  What then?  Was it\r\nsuch a great matter?  Aren't we always _acting_ lies?  Then why not tell\r\nthem?  Look at Mary--look what she had done.  While he was hurrying off\r\non his honest errand, what was she doing?  Lamenting because the papers\r\nhadn't been destroyed and the money kept.  Is theft better than lying?\r\n\r\n_That_ point lost its sting--the lie dropped into the background and left\r\ncomfort behind it.  The next point came to the front: _had_ he rendered\r\nthat service?  Well, here was Goodson's own evidence as reported in\r\nStephenson's letter; there could be no better evidence than that--it was\r\neven _proof_ that he had rendered it.  Of course.  So that point was\r\nsettled. . . No, not quite.  He recalled with a wince that this unknown\r\nMr. Stephenson was just a trifle unsure as to whether the performer of it\r\nwas Richards or some other--and, oh dear, he had put Richards on his\r\nhonour!  He must himself decide whither that money must go--and Mr.\r\nStephenson was not doubting that if he was the wrong man he would go\r\nhonourably and find the right one.  Oh, it was odious to put a man in\r\nsuch a situation--ah, why couldn't Stephenson have left out that doubt?\r\nWhat did he want to intrude that for?\r\n\r\nFurther reflection.  How did it happen that _Richards's_ name remained in\r\nStephenson's mind as indicating the right man, and not some other man's\r\nname?  That looked good.  Yes, that looked very good.  In fact it went on\r\nlooking better and better, straight along--until by-and-by it grew into\r\npositive _proof_.  And then Richards put the matter at once out of his\r\nmind, for he had a private instinct that a proof once established is\r\nbetter left so.\r\n\r\nHe was feeling reasonably comfortable now, but there was still one other\r\ndetail that kept pushing itself on his notice: of course he had done that\r\nservice--that was settled; but what _was_ that service?  He must recall\r\nit--he would not go to sleep till he had recalled it; it would make his\r\npeace of mind perfect.  And so he thought and thought.  He thought of a\r\ndozen things--possible services, even probable services--but none of them\r\nseemed adequate, none of them seemed large enough, none of them seemed\r\nworth the money--worth the fortune Goodson had wished he could leave in\r\nhis will.  And besides, he couldn't remember having done them, anyway.\r\nNow, then--now, then--what _kind_ of a service would it be that would\r\nmake a man so inordinately grateful?  Ah--the saving of his soul!  That\r\nmust be it.  Yes, he could remember, now, how he once set himself the\r\ntask of converting Goodson, and laboured at it as much as--he was going\r\nto say three months; but upon closer examination it shrunk to a month,\r\nthen to a week, then to a day, then to nothing.  Yes, he remembered now,\r\nand with unwelcome vividness, that Goodson had told him to go to thunder\r\nand mind his own business--_he_ wasn't hankering to follow Hadleyburg to\r\nheaven!\r\n\r\nSo that solution was a failure--he hadn't saved Goodson's soul.  Richards\r\nwas discouraged.  Then after a little came another idea: had he saved\r\nGoodson's property?  No, that wouldn't do--he hadn't any.  His life?  That\r\nis it!  Of course.  Why, he might have thought of it before.  This time\r\nhe was on the right track, sure.  His imagination-mill was hard at work\r\nin a minute, now.\r\n\r\nThereafter, during a stretch of two exhausting hours, he was busy saving\r\nGoodson's life.  He saved it in all kinds of difficult and perilous ways.\r\nIn every case he got it saved satisfactorily up to a certain point; then,\r\njust as he was beginning to get well persuaded that it had really\r\nhappened, a troublesome detail would turn up which made the whole thing\r\nimpossible.  As in the matter of drowning, for instance.  In that case he\r\nhad swum out and tugged Goodson ashore in an unconscious state with a\r\ngreat crowd looking on and applauding, but when he had got it all thought\r\nout and was just beginning to remember all about it, a whole swarm of\r\ndisqualifying details arrived on the ground: the town would have known of\r\nthe circumstance, Mary would have known of it, it would glare like a\r\nlimelight in his own memory instead of being an inconspicuous service\r\nwhich he had possibly rendered \"without knowing its full value.\"  And at\r\nthis point he remembered that he couldn't swim anyway.\r\n\r\nAh--_there_ was a point which he had been overlooking from the start: it\r\nhad to be a service which he had rendered \"possibly without knowing the\r\nfull value of it.\"  Why, really, that ought to be an easy hunt--much\r\neasier than those others.  And sure enough, by-and-by he found it.\r\nGoodson, years and years ago, came near marrying a very sweet and pretty\r\ngirl, named Nancy Hewitt, but in some way or other the match had been\r\nbroken off; the girl died, Goodson remained a bachelor, and by-and-by\r\nbecame a soured one and a frank despiser of the human species.  Soon\r\nafter the girl's death the village found out, or thought it had found\r\nout, that she carried a spoonful of negro blood in her veins.  Richards\r\nworked at these details a good while, and in the end he thought he\r\nremembered things concerning them which must have gotten mislaid in his\r\nmemory through long neglect.  He seemed to dimly remember that it was\r\n_he_ that found out about the negro blood; that it was he that told the\r\nvillage; that the village told Goodson where they got it; that he thus\r\nsaved Goodson from marrying the tainted girl; that he had done him this\r\ngreat service \"without knowing the full value of it,\" in fact without\r\nknowing that he _was_ doing it; but that Goodson knew the value of it,\r\nand what a narrow escape he had had, and so went to his grave grateful to\r\nhis benefactor and wishing he had a fortune to leave him.  It was all\r\nclear and simple, now, and the more he went over it the more luminous and\r\ncertain it grew; and at last, when he nestled to sleep, satisfied and\r\nhappy, he remembered the whole thing just as if it had been yesterday.  In\r\nfact, he dimly remembered Goodson's _telling_ him his gratitude once.\r\nMeantime Mary had spent six thousand dollars on a new house for herself\r\nand a pair of slippers for her pastor, and then had fallen peacefully to\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThat same Saturday evening the postman had delivered a letter to each of\r\nthe other principal citizens--nineteen letters in all.  No two of the\r\nenvelopes were alike, and no two of the superscriptions were in the same\r\nhand, but the letters inside were just like each other in every detail\r\nbut one.  They were exact copies of the letter received by\r\nRichards--handwriting and all--and were all signed by Stephenson, but in\r\nplace of Richards's name each receiver's own name appeared.\r\n\r\nAll night long eighteen principal citizens did what their caste-brother\r\nRichards was doing at the same time--they put in their energies trying to\r\nremember what notable service it was that they had unconsciously done\r\nBarclay Goodson.  In no case was it a holiday job; still they succeeded.\r\n\r\nAnd while they were at this work, which was difficult, their wives put in\r\nthe night spending the money, which was easy.  During that one night the\r\nnineteen wives spent an average of seven thousand dollars each out of the\r\nforty thousand in the sack--a hundred and thirty-three thousand\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nNext day there was a surprise for Jack Halliday.  He noticed that the\r\nfaces of the nineteen chief citizens and their wives bore that expression\r\nof peaceful and holy happiness again.  He could not understand it,\r\nneither was he able to invent any remarks about it that could damage it\r\nor disturb it.  And so it was his turn to be dissatisfied with life.  His\r\nprivate guesses at the reasons for the happiness failed in all instances,\r\nupon examination.  When he met Mrs. Wilcox and noticed the placid ecstasy\r\nin her face, he said to himself, \"Her cat has had kittens\"--and went and\r\nasked the cook; it was not so, the cook had detected the happiness, but\r\ndid not know the cause.  When Halliday found the duplicate ecstasy in the\r\nface of \"Shadbelly\" Billson (village nickname), he was sure some\r\nneighbour of Billson's had broken his leg, but inquiry showed that this\r\nhad not happened.  The subdued ecstasy in Gregory Yates's face could mean\r\nbut one thing--he was a mother-in-law short; it was another mistake.  \"And\r\nPinkerton--Pinkerton--he has collected ten cents that he thought he was\r\ngoing to lose.\"  And so on, and so on.  In some cases the guesses had to\r\nremain in doubt, in the others they proved distinct errors.  In the end\r\nHalliday said to himself, \"Anyway it roots up that there's nineteen\r\nHadleyburg families temporarily in heaven: I don't know how it happened;\r\nI only know Providence is off duty to-day.\"\r\n\r\nAn architect and builder from the next State had lately ventured to set\r\nup a small business in this unpromising village, and his sign had now\r\nbeen hanging out a week.  Not a customer yet; he was a discouraged man,\r\nand sorry he had come.  But his weather changed suddenly now.  First one\r\nand then another chief citizen's wife said to him privately:\r\n\r\n\"Come to my house Monday week--but say nothing about it for the present.\r\nWe think of building.\"\r\n\r\nHe got eleven invitations that day.  That night he wrote his daughter and\r\nbroke off her match with her student.  He said she could marry a mile\r\nhigher than that.\r\n\r\nPinkerton the banker and two or three other well-to-do men planned\r\ncountry-seats--but waited.  That kind don't count their chickens until\r\nthey are hatched.\r\n\r\nThe Wilsons devised a grand new thing--a fancy-dress ball.  They made no\r\nactual promises, but told all their acquaintanceship in confidence that\r\nthey were thinking the matter over and thought they should give it--\"and\r\nif we do, you will be invited, of course.\"  People were surprised, and\r\nsaid, one to another, \"Why, they are crazy, those poor Wilsons, they\r\ncan't afford it.\"  Several among the nineteen said privately to their\r\nhusbands, \"It is a good idea, we will keep still till their cheap thing\r\nis over, then _we_ will give one that will make it sick.\"\r\n\r\nThe days drifted along, and the bill of future squanderings rose higher\r\nand higher, wilder and wilder, more and more foolish and reckless.  It\r\nbegan to look as if every member of the nineteen would not only spend his\r\nwhole forty thousand dollars before receiving-day, but be actually in\r\ndebt by the time he got the money.  In some cases light-headed people did\r\nnot stop with planning to spend, they really spent--on credit.  They\r\nbought land, mortgages, farms, speculative stocks, fine clothes, horses,\r\nand various other things, paid down the bonus, and made themselves liable\r\nfor the rest--at ten days.  Presently the sober second thought came, and\r\nHalliday noticed that a ghastly anxiety was beginning to show up in a\r\ngood many faces.  Again he was puzzled, and didn't know what to make of\r\nit.  \"The Wilcox kittens aren't dead, for they weren't born; nobody's\r\nbroken a leg; there's no shrinkage in mother-in-laws; _nothing_ has\r\nhappened--it is an insolvable mystery.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another puzzled man, too--the Rev. Mr. Burgess.  For days,\r\nwherever he went, people seemed to follow him or to be watching out for\r\nhim; and if he ever found himself in a retired spot, a member of the\r\nnineteen would be sure to appear, thrust an envelope privately into his\r\nhand, whisper \"To be opened at the town-hall Friday evening,\" then vanish\r\naway like a guilty thing.  He was expecting that there might be one\r\nclaimant for the sack--doubtful, however, Goodson being dead--but it\r\nnever occurred to him that all this crowd might be claimants.  When the\r\ngreat Friday came at last, he found that he had nineteen envelopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town-hall had never looked finer.  The platform at the end of it was\r\nbacked by a showy draping of flags; at intervals along the walls were\r\nfestoons of flags; the gallery fronts were clothed in flags; the\r\nsupporting columns were swathed in flags; all this was to impress the\r\nstranger, for he would be there in considerable force, and in a large\r\ndegree he would be connected with the press.  The house was full.  The\r\n412 fixed seats were occupied; also the 68 extra chairs which had been\r\npacked into the aisles; the steps of the platform were occupied; some\r\ndistinguished strangers were given seats on the platform; at the\r\nhorseshoe of tables which fenced the front and sides of the platform sat\r\na strong force of special correspondents who had come from everywhere.  It\r\nwas the best-dressed house the town had ever produced.  There were some\r\ntolerably expensive toilets there, and in several cases the ladies who\r\nwore them had the look of being unfamiliar with that kind of clothes.  At\r\nleast the town thought they had that look, but the notion could have\r\narisen from the town's knowledge of the fact that these ladies had never\r\ninhabited such clothes before.\r\n\r\nThe gold-sack stood on a little table at the front of the platform where\r\nall the house could see it.  The bulk of the house gazed at it with a\r\nburning interest, a mouth-watering interest, a wistful and pathetic\r\ninterest; a minority of nineteen couples gazed at it tenderly, lovingly,\r\nproprietarily, and the male half of this minority kept saying over to\r\nthemselves the moving little impromptu speeches of thankfulness for the\r\naudience's applause and congratulations which they were presently going\r\nto get up and deliver.  Every now and then one of these got a piece of\r\npaper out of his vest pocket and privately glanced at it to refresh his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nOf course there was a buzz of conversation going on--there always is; but\r\nat last, when the Rev. Mr. Burgess rose and laid his hand on the sack, he\r\ncould hear his microbes gnaw, the place was so still.  He related the\r\ncurious history of the sack, then went on to speak in warm terms of\r\nHadleyburg's old and well-earned reputation for spotless honesty, and of\r\nthe town's just pride in this reputation.  He said that this reputation\r\nwas a treasure of priceless value; that under Providence its value had\r\nnow become inestimably enhanced, for the recent episode had spread this\r\nfame far and wide, and thus had focussed the eyes of the American world\r\nupon this village, and made its name for all time, as he hoped and\r\nbelieved, a synonym for commercial incorruptibility.  [Applause.]  \"And\r\nwho is to be the guardian of this noble fame--the community as a whole?\r\nNo!  The responsibility is individual, not communal.  From this day forth\r\neach and every one of you is in his own person its special guardian, and\r\nindividually responsible that no harm shall come to it.  Do you--does\r\neach of you--accept this great trust?  [Tumultuous assent.]  Then all is\r\nwell.  Transmit it to your children and to your children's children.  To-\r\nday your purity is beyond reproach--see to it that it shall remain so.  To-\r\nday there is not a person in your community who could be beguiled to\r\ntouch a penny not his own--see to it that you abide in this grace.  [\"We\r\nwill! we will!\"]  This is not the place to make comparisons between\r\nourselves and other communities--some of them ungracious towards us; they\r\nhave their ways, we have ours; let us be content.  [Applause.]  I am\r\ndone.  Under my hand, my friends, rests a stranger's eloquent recognition\r\nof what we are; through him the world will always henceforth know what we\r\nare.  We do not know who he is, but in your name I utter your gratitude,\r\nand ask you to raise your voices in indorsement.\"\r\n\r\nThe house rose in a body and made the walls quake with the thunders of\r\nits thankfulness for the space of a long minute.  Then it sat down, and\r\nMr. Burgess took an envelope out of his pocket.  The house held its\r\nbreath while he slit the envelope open and took from it a slip of paper.\r\nHe read its contents--slowly and impressively--the audience listening\r\nwith tranced attention to this magic document, each of whose words stood\r\nfor an ingot of gold:\r\n\r\n\"'The remark which I made to the distressed stranger was this: \"You are\r\nvery far from being a bad man; go, and reform.\"'\"  Then he continued:--\"We\r\nshall know in a moment now whether the remark here quoted corresponds\r\nwith the one concealed in the sack; and if that shall prove to be so--and\r\nit undoubtedly will--this sack of gold belongs to a fellow-citizen who\r\nwill henceforth stand before the nation as the symbol of the special\r\nvirtue which has made our town famous throughout the land--Mr. Billson!\"\r\n\r\nThe house had gotten itself all ready to burst into the proper tornado of\r\napplause; but instead of doing it, it seemed stricken with a paralysis;\r\nthere was a deep hush for a moment or two, then a wave of whispered\r\nmurmurs swept the place--of about this tenor: \"_Billson_! oh, come, this\r\nis _too_ thin!  Twenty dollars to a stranger--or _anybody_--_Billson_!\r\nTell it to the marines!\"  And now at this point the house caught its\r\nbreath all of a sudden in a new access of astonishment, for it discovered\r\nthat whereas in one part of the hall Deacon Billson was standing up with\r\nhis head weekly bowed, in another part of it Lawyer Wilson was doing the\r\nsame.  There was a wondering silence now for a while.  Everybody was\r\npuzzled, and nineteen couples were surprised and indignant.\r\n\r\nBillson and Wilson turned and stared at each other.  Billson asked,\r\nbitingly:\r\n\r\n\"Why do _you_ rise, Mr. Wilson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have a right to.  Perhaps you will be good enough to explain\r\nto the house why _you_ rise.\"\r\n\r\n\"With great pleasure.  Because I wrote that paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an impudent falsity!  I wrote it myself.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Burgess's turn to be paralysed.  He stood looking vacantly at\r\nfirst one of the men and then the other, and did not seem to know what to\r\ndo.  The house was stupefied.  Lawyer Wilson spoke up now, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I ask the Chair to read the name signed to that paper.\"\r\n\r\nThat brought the Chair to itself, and it read out the name:\r\n\r\n\"John Wharton _Billson_.\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\" shouted Billson, \"what have you got to say for yourself now?  And\r\nwhat kind of apology are you going to make to me and to this insulted\r\nhouse for the imposture which you have attempted to play here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No apologies are due, sir; and as for the rest of it, I publicly charge\r\nyou with pilfering my note from Mr. Burgess and substituting a copy of it\r\nsigned with your own name.  There is no other way by which you could have\r\ngotten hold of the test-remark; I alone, of living men, possessed the\r\nsecret of its wording.\"\r\n\r\nThere was likely to be a scandalous state of things if this went on;\r\neverybody noticed with distress that the shorthand scribes were\r\nscribbling like mad; many people were crying \"Chair, chair!  Order!\r\norder!\"  Burgess rapped with his gavel, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Let us not forget the proprieties due.  There has evidently been a\r\nmistake somewhere, but surely that is all.  If Mr. Wilson gave me an\r\nenvelope--and I remember now that he did--I still have it.\"\r\n\r\nHe took one out of his pocket, opened it, glanced at it, looked surprised\r\nand worried, and stood silent a few moments.  Then he waved his hand in a\r\nwandering and mechanical way, and made an effort or two to say something,\r\nthen gave it up, despondently.  Several voices cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Read it! read it!  What is it?\"\r\n\r\nSo he began, in a dazed and sleep-walker fashion:\r\n\r\n\"'The remark which I made to the unhappy stranger was this: \"You are far\r\nfrom being a bad man.  [The house gazed at him marvelling.]  Go, and\r\nreform.\"'  [Murmurs: \"Amazing! what can this mean?\"]  This one,\" said the\r\nChair, \"is signed Thurlow G. Wilson.\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\" cried Wilson, \"I reckon that settles it!  I knew perfectly well\r\nmy note was purloined.\"\r\n\r\n\"Purloined!\" retorted Billson.  \"I'll let you know that neither you nor\r\nany man of your kidney must venture to--\"\r\n\r\nThe Chair: \"Order, gentlemen, order!  Take your seats, both of you,\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\nThey obeyed, shaking their heads and grumbling angrily.  The house was\r\nprofoundly puzzled; it did not know what to do with this curious\r\nemergency.  Presently Thompson got up.  Thompson was the hatter.  He\r\nwould have liked to be a Nineteener; but such was not for him; his stock\r\nof hats was not considerable enough for the position.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman, if I may be permitted to make a suggestion, can both of\r\nthese gentlemen be right?  I put it to you, sir, can both have happened\r\nto say the very same words to the stranger?  It seems to me--\"\r\n\r\nThe tanner got up and interrupted him.  The tanner was a disgruntled man;\r\nhe believed himself entitled to be a Nineteener, but he couldn't get\r\nrecognition.  It made him a little unpleasant in his ways and speech.\r\nSaid he:\r\n\r\n\"Sho, _that's_ not the point!  _That_ could happen--twice in a hundred\r\nyears--but not the other thing.  _Neither_ of them gave the twenty\r\ndollars!\"  [A ripple of applause.]\r\n\r\nBillson.  \"I did!\"\r\n\r\nWilson.  \"I did!\"\r\n\r\nThen each accused the other of pilfering.\r\n\r\nThe Chair.  \"Order!  Sit down, if you please--both of you.  Neither of\r\nthe notes has been out of my possession at any moment.\"\r\n\r\nA Voice.  \"Good--that settles _that_!\"\r\n\r\nThe Tanner.  \"Mr. Chairman, one thing is now plain: one of these men has\r\nbeen eavesdropping under the other one's bed, and filching family\r\nsecrets.  If it is not unparliamentary to suggest it, I will remark that\r\nboth are equal to it.  [The Chair.  \"Order! order!\"]  I withdraw the\r\nremark, sir, and will confine myself to suggesting that _if_ one of them\r\nhas overheard the other reveal the test-remark to his wife, we shall\r\ncatch him now.\"\r\n\r\nA Voice.  \"How?\"\r\n\r\nThe Tanner.  \"Easily.  The two have not quoted the remark in exactly the\r\nsame words.  You would have noticed that, if there hadn't been a\r\nconsiderable stretch of time and an exciting quarrel inserted between the\r\ntwo readings.\"\r\n\r\nA Voice.  \"Name the difference.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tanner.  \"The word _very_ is in Billson's note, and not in the\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nMany Voices.  \"That's so--he's right!\"\r\n\r\nThe Tanner.  \"And so, if the Chair will examine the test-remark in the\r\nsack, we shall know which of these two frauds--[The Chair.\r\n\"Order!\"]--which of these two adventurers--[The Chair.  \"Order!\r\norder!\"]--which of these two gentlemen--[laughter and applause]--is\r\nentitled to wear the belt as being the first dishonest blatherskite ever\r\nbred in this town--which he has dishonoured, and which will be a sultry\r\nplace for him from now out!\"  [Vigorous applause.]\r\n\r\nMany Voices.  \"Open it!--open the sack!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Burgess made a slit in the sack, slid his hand in, and brought out an\r\nenvelope.  In it were a couple of folded notes.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"One of these is marked, 'Not to be examined until all written\r\ncommunications which have been addressed to the Chair--if any--shall have\r\nbeen read.'  The other is marked '_The Test_.'  Allow me.  It is\r\nworded--to wit:\r\n\r\n\"'I do not require that the first half of the remark which was made to me\r\nby my benefactor shall be quoted with exactness, for it was not striking,\r\nand could be forgotten; but its closing fifteen words are quite striking,\r\nand I think easily rememberable; unless _these_ shall be accurately\r\nreproduced, let the applicant be regarded as an impostor.  My benefactor\r\nbegan by saying he seldom gave advice to anyone, but that it always bore\r\nthe hall-mark of high value when he did give it.  Then he said this--and\r\nit has never faded from my memory: '_You are far from being a bad\r\nman_--''\"\r\n\r\nFifty Voices.  \"That settles it--the money's Wilson's!  Wilson!  Wilson!\r\nSpeech!  Speech!\"\r\n\r\nPeople jumped up and crowded around Wilson, wringing his hand and\r\ncongratulating fervently--meantime the Chair was hammering with the gavel\r\nand shouting:\r\n\r\n\"Order, gentlemen!  Order!  Order!  Let me finish reading, please.\"  When\r\nquiet was restored, the reading was resumed--as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'_Go, and reform--or, mark my words--some day, for your sins you will\r\ndie and go to hell or Hadleyburg_--TRY AND MAKE IT THE FORMER.'\"\r\n\r\nA ghastly silence followed.  First an angry cloud began to settle darkly\r\nupon the faces of the citizenship; after a pause the cloud began to rise,\r\nand a tickled expression tried to take its place; tried so hard that it\r\nwas only kept under with great and painful difficulty; the reporters, the\r\nBrixtonites, and other strangers bent their heads down and shielded their\r\nfaces with their hands, and managed to hold in by main strength and\r\nheroic courtesy.  At this most inopportune time burst upon the stillness\r\nthe roar of a solitary voice--Jack Halliday's:\r\n\r\n\"_That's_ got the hall-mark on it!\"\r\n\r\nThen the house let go, strangers and all.  Even Mr. Burgess's gravity\r\nbroke down presently, then the audience considered itself officially\r\nabsolved from all restraint, and it made the most of its privilege.  It\r\nwas a good long laugh, and a tempestuously wholehearted one, but it\r\nceased at last--long enough for Mr. Burgess to try to resume, and for the\r\npeople to get their eyes partially wiped; then it broke out again, and\r\nafterward yet again; then at last Burgess was able to get out these\r\nserious words:\r\n\r\n\"It is useless to try to disguise the fact--we find ourselves in the\r\npresence of a matter of grave import.  It involves the honour of your\r\ntown--it strikes at the town's good name.  The difference of a single\r\nword between the test-remarks offered by Mr. Wilson and Mr. Billson was\r\nitself a serious thing, since it indicated that one or the other of these\r\ngentlemen had committed a theft--\"\r\n\r\nThe two men were sitting limp, nerveless, crushed; but at these words\r\nboth were electrified into movement, and started to get up.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down!\" said the Chair, sharply, and they obeyed.  \"That, as I have\r\nsaid, was a serious thing.  And it was--but for only one of them.  But\r\nthe matter has become graver; for the honour of _both_ is now in\r\nformidable peril.  Shall I go even further, and say in inextricable\r\nperil?  _Both_ left out the crucial fifteen words.\"  He paused.  During\r\nseveral moments he allowed the pervading stillness to gather and deepen\r\nits impressive effects, then added: \"There would seem to be but one way\r\nwhereby this could happen.  I ask these gentlemen--Was there\r\n_collusion_?--_agreement_?\"\r\n\r\nA low murmur sifted through the house; its import was, \"He's got them\r\nboth.\"\r\n\r\nBillson was not used to emergencies; he sat in a helpless collapse.  But\r\nWilson was a lawyer.  He struggled to his feet, pale and worried, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I ask the indulgence of the house while I explain this most painful\r\nmatter.  I am sorry to say what I am about to say, since it must inflict\r\nirreparable injury upon Mr. Billson, whom I have always esteemed and\r\nrespected until now, and in whose invulnerability to temptation I\r\nentirely believed--as did you all.  But for the preservation of my own\r\nhonour I must speak--and with frankness.  I confess with shame--and I now\r\nbeseech your pardon for it--that I said to the ruined stranger all of the\r\nwords contained in the test-remark, including the disparaging fifteen.\r\n[Sensation.]  When the late publication was made I recalled them, and I\r\nresolved to claim the sack of coin, for by every right I was entitled to\r\nit.  Now I will ask you to consider this point, and weigh it well; that\r\nstranger's gratitude to me that night knew no bounds; he said himself\r\nthat he could find no words for it that were adequate, and that if he\r\nshould ever be able he would repay me a thousandfold.  Now, then, I ask\r\nyou this; could I expect--could I believe--could I even remotely\r\nimagine--that, feeling as he did, he would do so ungrateful a thing as to\r\nadd those quite unnecessary fifteen words to his test?--set a trap for\r\nme?--expose me as a slanderer of my own town before my own people\r\nassembled in a public hall?  It was preposterous; it was impossible.  His\r\ntest would contain only the kindly opening clause of my remark.  Of that\r\nI had no shadow of doubt.  You would have thought as I did.  You would\r\nnot have expected a base betrayal from one whom you had befriended and\r\nagainst whom you had committed no offence.  And so with perfect\r\nconfidence, perfect trust, I wrote on a piece of paper the opening\r\nwords--ending with \"Go, and reform,\"--and signed it.  When I was about to\r\nput it in an envelope I was called into my back office, and without\r\nthinking I left the paper lying open on my desk.\"  He stopped, turned his\r\nhead slowly toward Billson, waited a moment, then added: \"I ask you to\r\nnote this; when I returned, a little latter, Mr. Billson was retiring by\r\nmy street door.\"  [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIn a moment Billson was on his feet and shouting:\r\n\r\n\"It's a lie!  It's an infamous lie!\"\r\n\r\nThe Chair.  \"Be seated, sir!  Mr. Wilson has the floor.\"\r\n\r\nBillson's friends pulled him into his seat and quieted him, and Wilson\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n\"Those are the simple facts.  My note was now lying in a different place\r\non the table from where I had left it.  I noticed that, but attached no\r\nimportance to it, thinking a draught had blown it there.  That Mr.\r\nBillson would read a private paper was a thing which could not occur to\r\nme; he was an honourable man, and he would be above that.  If you will\r\nallow me to say it, I think his extra word '_very_' stands explained: it\r\nis attributable to a defect of memory.  I was the only man in the world\r\nwho could furnish here any detail of the test-mark--by _honourable_\r\nmeans.  I have finished.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the world like a persuasive speech to fuddle the\r\nmental apparatus and upset the convictions and debauch the emotions of an\r\naudience not practised in the tricks and delusions of oratory.  Wilson\r\nsat down victorious.  The house submerged him in tides of approving\r\napplause; friends swarmed to him and shook him by the hand and\r\ncongratulated him, and Billson was shouted down and not allowed to say a\r\nword.  The Chair hammered and hammered with its gavel, and kept shouting:\r\n\r\n\"But let us proceed, gentlemen, let us proceed!\"\r\n\r\nAt last there was a measurable degree of quiet, and the hatter said:\r\n\r\n\"But what is there to proceed with, sir, but to deliver the money?\"\r\n\r\nVoices.  \"That's it!  That's it!  Come forward, Wilson!\"\r\n\r\nThe Hatter.  \"I move three cheers for Mr. Wilson, Symbol of the special\r\nvirtue which--\"\r\n\r\nThe cheers burst forth before he could finish; and in the midst of\r\nthem--and in the midst of the clamour of the gavel also--some enthusiasts\r\nmounted Wilson on a big friend's shoulder and were going to fetch him in\r\ntriumph to the platform.  The Chair's voice now rose above the noise:\r\n\r\n\"Order!  To your places!  You forget that there is still a document to be\r\nread.\"  When quiet had been restored he took up the document, and was\r\ngoing to read it, but laid it down again saying \"I forgot; this is not to\r\nbe read until all written communications received by me have first been\r\nread.\"  He took an envelope out of his pocket, removed its enclosure,\r\nglanced at it--seemed astonished--held it out and gazed at it--stared at\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTwenty or thirty voices cried out\r\n\r\n\"What is it?  Read it! read it!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he did--slowly, and wondering:\r\n\r\n\"'The remark which I made to the stranger--[Voices.  \"Hello! how's\r\nthis?\"]--was this: 'You are far from being a bad man.  [Voices.  \"Great\r\nScott!\"]  Go, and reform.'\"  [Voice.  \"Oh, saw my leg off!\"]  Signed by\r\nMr. Pinkerton the banker.\"\r\n\r\nThe pandemonium of delight which turned itself loose now was of a sort to\r\nmake the judicious weep.  Those whose withers were unwrung laughed till\r\nthe tears ran down; the reporters, in throes of laughter, set down\r\ndisordered pot-hooks which would never in the world be decipherable; and\r\na sleeping dog jumped up scared out of its wits, and barked itself crazy\r\nat the turmoil.  All manner of cries were scattered through the din:\r\n\"We're getting rich--_two_ Symbols of Incorruptibility!--without counting\r\nBillson!\"  \"_Three_!--count Shadbelly in--we can't have too many!\"  \"All\r\nright--Billson's elected!\"  \"Alas, poor Wilson! victim of _two_ thieves!\"\r\n\r\nA Powerful Voice.  \"Silence!  The Chair's fished up something more out of\r\nits pocket.\"\r\n\r\nVoices.  \"Hurrah!  Is it something fresh?  Read it! read! read!\"\r\n\r\nThe Chair [reading].  \"'The remark which I made,' etc.  'You are far from\r\nbeing a bad man.  Go,' etc.  Signed, 'Gregory Yates.'\"\r\n\r\nTornado of Voices.  \"Four Symbols!\"  \"'Rah for Yates!\"  \"Fish again!\"\r\n\r\nThe house was in a roaring humour now, and ready to get all the fun out\r\nof the occasion that might be in it.  Several Nineteeners, looking pale\r\nand distressed, got up and began to work their way towards the aisles,\r\nbut a score of shouts went up:\r\n\r\n\"The doors, the doors--close the doors; no Incorruptible shall leave this\r\nplace!  Sit down, everybody!\"  The mandate was obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"Fish again!  Read! read!\"\r\n\r\nThe Chair fished again, and once more the familiar words began to fall\r\nfrom its lips--\"'You are far from being a bad man--'\"\r\n\r\n\"Name! name!  What's his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"'L. Ingoldsby Sargent.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Five elected!  Pile up the Symbols!  Go on, go on!\"\r\n\r\n\"'You are far from being a bad--'\"\r\n\r\n\"Name! name!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Nicholas Whitworth.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Hooray! hooray! it's a symbolical day!\"\r\n\r\nSomebody wailed in, and began to sing this rhyme (leaving out \"it's\") to\r\nthe lovely \"Mikado\" tune of \"When a man's afraid of a beautiful maid;\"\r\nthe audience joined in, with joy; then, just in time, somebody\r\ncontributed another line--\r\n\r\n   \"And don't you this forget--\"\r\n\r\nThe house roared it out.  A third line was at once furnished--\r\n\r\n   \"Corruptibles far from Hadleyburg are--\"\r\n\r\nThe house roared that one too.  As the last note died, Jack Halliday's\r\nvoice rose high and clear, freighted with a final line--\r\n\r\n   \"But the Symbols are here, you bet!\"\r\n\r\nThat was sung, with booming enthusiasm.  Then the happy house started in\r\nat the beginning and sang the four lines through twice, with immense\r\nswing and dash, and finished up with a crashing three-times-three and a\r\ntiger for \"Hadleyburg the Incorruptible and all Symbols of it which we\r\nshall find worthy to receive the hall-mark to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThen the shoutings at the Chair began again, all over the place:\r\n\r\n\"Go on! go on!  Read! read some more!  Read all you've got!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it--go on!  We are winning eternal celebrity!\"\r\n\r\nA dozen men got up now and began to protest.  They said that this farce\r\nwas the work of some abandoned joker, and was an insult to the whole\r\ncommunity.  Without a doubt these signatures were all forgeries--\r\n\r\n\"Sit down! sit down!  Shut up!  You are confessing.  We'll find your\r\nnames in the lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman, how many of those envelopes have you got?\"\r\n\r\nThe Chair counted.\r\n\r\n\"Together with those that have been already examined, there are\r\nnineteen.\"\r\n\r\nA storm of derisive applause broke out.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they all contain the secret.  I move that you open them all and\r\nread every signature that is attached to a note of that sort--and read\r\nalso the first eight words of the note.\"\r\n\r\n\"Second the motion!\"\r\n\r\nIt was put and carried--uproariously.  Then poor old Richards got up, and\r\nhis wife rose and stood at his side.  Her head was bent down, so that\r\nnone might see that she was crying.  Her husband gave her his arm, and so\r\nsupporting her, he began to speak in a quavering voice:\r\n\r\n\"My friends, you have known us two--Mary and me--all our lives, and I\r\nthink you have liked us and respected us--\"\r\n\r\nThe Chair interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\"Allow me.  It is quite true--that which you are saying, Mr. Richards;\r\nthis town _does_ know you two; it _does_ like you; it _does_ respect you;\r\nmore--it honours you and _loves_ you--\"\r\n\r\nHalliday's voice rang out:\r\n\r\n\"That's the hall-marked truth, too!  If the Chair is right, let the house\r\nspeak up and say it.  Rise!  Now, then--hip! hip! hip!--all together!\"\r\n\r\nThe house rose in mass, faced toward the old couple eagerly, filled the\r\nair with a snow-storm of waving handkerchiefs, and delivered the cheers\r\nwith all its affectionate heart.\r\n\r\nThe Chair then continued:\r\n\r\n\"What I was going to say is this: We know your good heart, Mr. Richards,\r\nbut this is not a time for the exercise of charity toward offenders.\r\n[Shouts of \"Right! right!\"]  I see your generous purpose in your face,\r\nbut I cannot allow you to plead for these men--\"\r\n\r\n\"But I was going to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Please take your seat, Mr. Richards.  We must examine the rest of these\r\nnotes--simple fairness to the men who have already been exposed requires\r\nthis.  As soon as that has been done--I give you my word for this--you\r\nshall he heard.\"\r\n\r\nMany voices.  \"Right!--the Chair is right--no interruption can be\r\npermitted at this stage!  Go on!--the names! the names!--according to the\r\nterms of the motion!\"\r\n\r\nThe old couple sat reluctantly down, and the husband whispered to the\r\nwife, \"It is pitifully hard to have to wait; the shame will be greater\r\nthan ever when they find we were only going to plead for _ourselves_.\"\r\n\r\nStraightway the jollity broke loose again with the reading of the names.\r\n\r\n\"'You are far from being a bad man--' Signature, 'Robert J. Titmarsh.'\"\r\n\r\n'\"You are far from being a bad man--' Signature, 'Eliphalet Weeks.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'You are far from being a bad man--' Signature, 'Oscar B. Wilder.'\"\r\n\r\nAt this point the house lit upon the idea of taking the eight words out\r\nof the Chairman's hands.  He was not unthankful for that.  Thenceforward\r\nhe held up each note in its turn and waited.  The house droned out the\r\neight words in a massed and measured and musical deep volume of sound\r\n(with a daringly close resemblance to a well-known church chant)--\"You\r\nare f-a-r from being a b-a-a-a-d man.\"  Then the Chair said, \"Signature,\r\n'Archibald Wilcox.'\"  And so on, and so on, name after name, and\r\neverybody had an increasingly and gloriously good time except the\r\nwretched Nineteen.  Now and then, when a particularly shining name was\r\ncalled, the house made the Chair wait while it chanted the whole of the\r\ntest-remark from the beginning to the closing words, \"And go to hell or\r\nHadleyburg--try and make it the for-or-m-e-r!\" and in these special cases\r\nthey added a grand and agonised and imposing \"A-a-a-a-_men_!\"\r\n\r\nThe list dwindled, dwindled, dwindled, poor old Richards keeping tally of\r\nthe count, wincing when a name resembling his own was pronounced, and\r\nwaiting in miserable suspense for the time to come when it would be his\r\nhumiliating privilege to rise with Mary and finish his plea, which he was\r\nintending to word thus: \". . . for until now we have never done any wrong\r\nthing, but have gone our humble way unreproached.  We are very poor, we\r\nare old, and, have no chick nor child to help us; we were sorely tempted,\r\nand we fell.  It was my purpose when I got up before to make confession\r\nand beg that my name might not be read out in this public place, for it\r\nseemed to us that we could not bear it; but I was prevented.  It was\r\njust; it was our place to suffer with the rest.  It has been hard for us.\r\nIt is the first time we have ever heard our name fall from any one's\r\nlips--sullied.  Be merciful--for the sake or the better days; make our\r\nshame as light to bear as in your charity you can.\"  At this point in his\r\nreverie Mary nudged him, perceiving that his mind was absent.  The house\r\nwas chanting, \"You are f-a-r,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\"Be ready,\" Mary whispered.  \"Your name comes now; he has read eighteen.\"\r\n\r\nThe chant ended.\r\n\r\n\"Next! next! next!\" came volleying from all over the house.\r\n\r\nBurgess put his hand into his pocket.  The old couple, trembling, began\r\nto rise.  Burgess fumbled a moment, then said:\r\n\r\n\"I find I have read them all.\"\r\n\r\nFaint with joy and surprise, the couple sank into their seats, and Mary\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bless God, we are saved!--he has lost ours--I wouldn't give this for\r\na hundred of those sacks!\"\r\n\r\nThe house burst out with its \"Mikado\" travesty, and sang it three times\r\nwith ever-increasing enthusiasm, rising to its feet when it reached for\r\nthe third time the closing line--\r\n\r\n   \"But the Symbols are here, you bet!\"\r\n\r\nand finishing up with cheers and a tiger for \"Hadleyburg purity and our\r\neighteen immortal representatives of it.\"\r\n\r\nThen Wingate, the saddler, got up and proposed cheers \"for the cleanest\r\nman in town, the one solitary important citizen in it who didn't try to\r\nsteal that money--Edward Richards.\"\r\n\r\nThey were given with great and moving heartiness; then somebody proposed\r\nthat \"Richards be elected sole Guardian and Symbol of the now Sacred\r\nHadleyburg Tradition, with power and right to stand up and look the whole\r\nsarcastic world in the face.\"\r\n\r\nPassed, by acclamation; then they sang the \"Mikado\" again, and ended it\r\nwith--\r\n\r\n   \"And there's _one_ Symbol left, you bet!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause; then--\r\n\r\nA Voice.  \"Now, then, who's to get the sack?\"\r\n\r\nThe Tanner (with bitter sarcasm).  \"That's easy.  The money has to be\r\ndivided among the eighteen Incorruptibles.  They gave the suffering\r\nstranger twenty dollars apiece--and that remark--each in his turn--it\r\ntook twenty-two minutes for the procession to move past.  Staked the\r\nstranger--total contribution, $360.  All they want is just the loan\r\nback--and interest--forty thousand dollars altogether.\"\r\n\r\nMany Voices [derisively.]  \"That's it!  Divvy! divvy!  Be kind to the\r\npoor--don't keep them waiting!\"\r\n\r\nThe Chair.  \"Order!  I now offer the stranger's remaining document.  It\r\nsays: 'If no claimant shall appear [grand chorus of groans], I desire\r\nthat you open the sack and count out the money to the principal citizens\r\nof your town, they to take it in trust [Cries of \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\"], and use\r\nit in such ways as to them shall seem best for the propagation and\r\npreservation of your community's noble reputation for incorruptible\r\nhonesty [more cries]--a reputation to which their names and their efforts\r\nwill add a new and far-reaching lustre.\"  [Enthusiastic outburst of\r\nsarcastic applause.]  That seems to be all.  No--here is a postscript:\r\n\r\n\"'P.S.--CITIZENS OF HADLEYBURG: There _is_ no test-remark--nobody made\r\none.  [Great sensation.]  There wasn't any pauper stranger, nor any\r\ntwenty-dollar contribution, nor any accompanying benediction and\r\ncompliment--these are all inventions.  [General buzz and hum of\r\nastonishment and delight.]  Allow me to tell my story--it will take but a\r\nword or two.  I passed through your town at a certain time, and received\r\na deep offence which I had not earned.  Any other man would have been\r\ncontent to kill one or two of you and call it square, but to me that\r\nwould have been a trivial revenge, and inadequate; for the dead do not\r\n_suffer_. Besides I could not kill you all--and, anyway, made as I am,\r\neven that would not have satisfied me.  I wanted to damage every man in\r\nthe place, and every woman--and not in their bodies or in their estate,\r\nbut in their vanity--the place where feeble and foolish people are most\r\nvulnerable.  So I disguised myself and came back and studied you.  You\r\nwere easy game.  You had an old and lofty reputation for honesty, and\r\nnaturally you were proud of it--it was your treasure of treasures, the\r\nvery apple of your eye.  As soon as I found out that you carefully and\r\nvigilantly kept yourselves and your children _out of temptation_, I knew\r\nhow to proceed.  Why, you simple creatures, the weakest of all weak\r\nthings is a virtue which has not been tested in the fire.  I laid a plan,\r\nand gathered a list of names.  My project was to corrupt Hadleyburg the\r\nIncorruptible.  My idea was to make liars and thieves of nearly half a\r\nhundred smirchless men and women who had never in their lives uttered a\r\nlie or stolen a penny.  I was afraid of Goodson.  He was neither born nor\r\nreared in Hadleyburg.  I was afraid that if I started to operate my\r\nscheme by getting my letter laid before you, you would say to yourselves,\r\n'Goodson is the only man among us who would give away twenty dollars to a\r\npoor devil'--and then you might not bite at my bait.  But heaven took\r\nGoodson; then I knew I was safe, and I set my trap and baited it.  It may\r\nbe that I shall not catch all the men to whom I mailed the pretended test-\r\nsecret, but I shall catch the most of them, if I know Hadleyburg nature.\r\n[Voices.  \"Right--he got every last one of them.\"]  I believe they will\r\neven steal ostensible _gamble_-money, rather than miss, poor, tempted,\r\nand mistrained fellows.  I am hoping to eternally and everlastingly\r\nsquelch your vanity and give Hadleyburg a new renown--one that will\r\n_stick_--and spread far.  If I have succeeded, open the sack and summon\r\nthe Committee on Propagation and Preservation of the Hadleyburg\r\nReputation.'\"\r\n\r\nA Cyclone of Voices.  \"Open it!  Open it!  The Eighteen to the front!\r\nCommittee on Propagation of the Tradition!  Forward--the Incorruptibles!\"\r\n\r\nThe Chair ripped the sack wide, and gathered up a handful of bright,\r\nbroad, yellow coins, shook them together, then examined them.\r\n\r\n\"Friends, they are only gilded disks of lead!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a crashing outbreak of delight over this news, and when the\r\nnoise had subsided, the tanner called out:\r\n\r\n\"By right of apparent seniority in this business, Mr. Wilson is Chairman\r\nof the Committee on Propagation of the Tradition.  I suggest that he step\r\nforward on behalf of his pals, and receive in trust the money.\"\r\n\r\nA Hundred Voices.  \"Wilson!  Wilson!  Wilson!  Speech!  Speech!\"\r\n\r\nWilson [in a voice trembling with anger].  \"You will allow me to say, and\r\nwithout apologies for my language, _damn_ the money!\"\r\n\r\nA Voice.  \"Oh, and him a Baptist!\"\r\n\r\nA Voice.  \"Seventeen Symbols left!  Step up, gentlemen, and assume your\r\ntrust!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause--no response.\r\n\r\nThe Saddler.  \"Mr. Chairman, we've got _one_ clean man left, anyway, out\r\nof the late aristocracy; and he needs money, and deserves it.  I move\r\nthat you appoint Jack Halliday to get up there and auction off that sack\r\nof gilt twenty-dollar pieces, and give the result to the right man--the\r\nman whom Hadleyburg delights to honour--Edward Richards.\"\r\n\r\nThis was received with great enthusiasm, the dog taking a hand again; the\r\nsaddler started the bids at a dollar, the Brixton folk and Barnum's\r\nrepresentative fought hard for it, the people cheered every jump that the\r\nbids made, the excitement climbed moment by moment higher and higher, the\r\nbidders got on their mettle and grew steadily more and more daring, more\r\nand more determined, the jumps went from a dollar up to five, then to\r\nten, then to twenty, then fifty, then to a hundred, then--\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the auction Richards whispered in distress to his\r\nwife: \"Oh, Mary, can we allow it?  It--it--you see, it is an\r\nhonour--reward, a testimonial to purity of character, and--and--can we\r\nallow it?  Hadn't I better get up and--Oh, Mary, what ought we to\r\ndo?--what do you think we--\" [Halliday's voice.  \"Fifteen I'm\r\nbid!--fifteen for the sack!--twenty!--ah, thanks!--thirty--thanks again!\r\nThirty, thirty, thirty!--do I hear forty?--forty it is!  Keep the ball\r\nrolling, gentlemen, keep it rolling!--fifty!--thanks, noble Roman!--going\r\nat fifty, fifty, fifty!--seventy!--ninety!--splendid!--a hundred!--pile\r\nit up, pile it up!--hundred and twenty--forty!--just in time!--hundred\r\nand fifty!--Two hundred!--superb!  Do I hear two h--thanks!--two hundred\r\nand fifty!--\"]\r\n\r\n\"It is another temptation, Edward--I'm all in a tremble--but, oh, we've\r\nescaped one temptation, and that ought to warn us, to--[\"Six did I\r\nhear?--thanks!--six fifty, six f--SEVEN hundred!\"]  And yet, Edward, when\r\nyou think--nobody susp--[\"Eight hundred dollars!--hurrah!--make it\r\nnine!--Mr. Parsons, did I hear you say--thanks!--nine!--this noble sack\r\nof virgin lead going at only nine hundred dollars, gilding and all--come!\r\ndo I hear--a thousand!--gratefully yours!--did some one say eleven?--a\r\nsack which is going to be the most celebrated in the whole Uni--\"]  \"Oh,\r\nEdward\" (beginning to sob), \"we are so poor!--but--but--do as you think\r\nbest--do as you think best.\"\r\n\r\nEdward fell--that is, he sat still; sat with a conscience which was not\r\nsatisfied, but which was overpowered by circumstances.\r\n\r\nMeantime a stranger, who looked like an amateur detective gotten up as an\r\nimpossible English earl, had been watching the evening's proceedings with\r\nmanifest interest, and with a contented expression in his face; and he\r\nhad been privately commenting to himself.  He was now soliloquising\r\nsomewhat like this: \"None of the Eighteen are bidding; that is not\r\nsatisfactory; I must change that--the dramatic unities require it; they\r\nmust buy the sack they tried to steal; they must pay a heavy price,\r\ntoo--some of them are rich.  And another thing, when I make a mistake in\r\nHadleyburg nature the man that puts that error upon me is entitled to a\r\nhigh honorarium, and some one must pay.  This poor old Richards has\r\nbrought my judgment to shame; he is an honest man:--I don't understand\r\nit, but I acknowledge it.  Yes, he saw my deuces--_and_ with a straight\r\nflush, and by rights the pot is his.  And it shall be a jack-pot, too, if\r\nI can manage it.  He disappointed me, but let that pass.\"\r\n\r\nHe was watching the bidding.  At a thousand, the market broke: the prices\r\ntumbled swiftly.  He waited--and still watched.  One competitor dropped\r\nout; then another, and another.  He put in a bid or two now.  When the\r\nbids had sunk to ten dollars, he added a five; some one raised him a\r\nthree; he waited a moment, then flung in a fifty-dollar jump, and the\r\nsack was his--at $1,282.  The house broke out in cheers--then stopped;\r\nfor he was on his feet, and had lifted his hand.  He began to speak.\r\n\r\n\"I desire to say a word, and ask a favour.  I am a speculator in\r\nrarities, and I have dealings with persons interested in numismatics all\r\nover the world.  I can make a profit on this purchase, just as it stands;\r\nbut there is a way, if I can get your approval, whereby I can make every\r\none of these leaden twenty-dollar pieces worth its face in gold, and\r\nperhaps more.  Grant me that approval, and I will give part of my gains\r\nto your Mr. Richards, whose invulnerable probity you have so justly and\r\nso cordially recognised to-night; his share shall be ten thousand\r\ndollars, and I will hand him the money to-morrow.  [Great applause from\r\nthe house.  But the \"invulnerable probity\" made the Richardses blush\r\nprettily; however, it went for modesty, and did no harm.]  If you will\r\npass my proposition by a good majority--I would like a two-thirds vote--I\r\nwill regard that as the town's consent, and that is all I ask.  Rarities\r\nare always helped by any device which will rouse curiosity and compel\r\nremark.  Now if I may have your permission to stamp upon the faces of\r\neach of these ostensible coins the names of the eighteen gentlemen who--\"\r\n\r\nNine-tenths of the audience were on their feet in a moment--dog and\r\nall--and the proposition was carried with a whirlwind of approving\r\napplause and laughter.\r\n\r\nThey sat down, and all the Symbols except \"Dr.\" Clay Harkness got up,\r\nviolently protesting against the proposed outrage, and threatening to--\r\n\r\n\"I beg you not to threaten me,\" said the stranger calmly.  \"I know my\r\nlegal rights, and am not accustomed to being frightened at bluster.\"\r\n[Applause.]  He sat down.  \"Dr.\" Harkness saw an opportunity here.  He\r\nwas one of the two very rich men of the place, and Pinkerton was the\r\nother.  Harkness was proprietor of a mint; that is to say, a popular\r\npatent medicine.  He was running for the Legislature on one ticket, and\r\nPinkerton on the other.  It was a close race and a hot one, and getting\r\nhotter every day.  Both had strong appetites for money; each had bought a\r\ngreat tract of land, with a purpose; there was going to be a new railway,\r\nand each wanted to be in the Legislature and help locate the route to his\r\nown advantage; a single vote might make the decision, and with it two or\r\nthree fortunes.  The stake was large, and Harkness was a daring\r\nspeculator.  He was sitting close to the stranger.  He leaned over while\r\none or another of the other Symbols was entertaining the house with\r\nprotests and appeals, and asked, in a whisper,\r\n\r\n\"What is your price for the sack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you twenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-five.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say thirty.\"\r\n\r\n\"The price is forty thousand dollars; not a penny less.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I'll give it.  I will come to the hotel at ten in the\r\nmorning.  I don't want it known; will see you privately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good.\"  Then the stranger got up and said to the house:\r\n\r\n\"I find it late.  The speeches of these gentlemen are not without merit,\r\nnot without interest, not without grace; yet if I may he excused I will\r\ntake my leave.  I thank you for the great favour which you have shown me\r\nin granting my petition.  I ask the Chair to keep the sack for me until\r\nto-morrow, and to hand these three five-hundred-dollar notes to Mr.\r\nRichards.\"  They were passed up to the Chair.\r\n\r\n\"At nine I will call for the sack, and at eleven will deliver the rest of\r\nthe ten thousand to Mr. Richards in person at his home.  Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nThen he slipped out, and left the audience making a vast noise, which was\r\ncomposed of a mixture of cheers, the \"Mikado\" song, dog-disapproval, and\r\nthe chant, \"You are f-a-r from being a b-a-a-d man--a-a-a a-men!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt home the Richardses had to endure congratulations and compliments\r\nuntil midnight.  Then they were left to themselves.  They looked a little\r\nsad, and they sat silent and thinking.  Finally Mary sighed and said:\r\n\r\n\"Do you think we are to blame, Edward--_much_ to blame?\" and her eyes\r\nwandered to the accusing triplet of big bank-notes lying on the table,\r\nwhere the congratulators had been gloating over them and reverently\r\nfingering them.  Edward did not answer at once; then he brought out a\r\nsigh and said, hesitatingly:\r\n\r\n\"We--we couldn't help it, Mary.  It--well it was ordered.  _All_ things\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\nMary glanced up and looked at him steadily, but he didn't return the\r\nlook.  Presently she said:\r\n\r\n\"I thought congratulations and praises always tasted good.  But--it seems\r\nto me, now--Edward?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to stay in the bank?\"\r\n\r\n\"N--no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Resign?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the morning--by note.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does seem best.\"\r\n\r\nRichards bowed his head in his hands and muttered:\r\n\r\n\"Before I was not afraid to let oceans of people's money pour through my\r\nhands, but--Mary, I am so tired, so tired--\"\r\n\r\n\"We will go to bed.\"\r\n\r\nAt nine in the morning the stranger called for the sack and took it to\r\nthe hotel in a cab.  At ten Harkness had a talk with him privately.  The\r\nstranger asked for and got five cheques on a metropolitan bank--drawn to\r\n\"Bearer,\"--four for $1,500 each, and one for $34,000.  He put one of the\r\nformer in his pocket-book, and the remainder, representing $38,500, he\r\nput in an envelope, and with these he added a note which he wrote after\r\nHarkness was gone.  At eleven he called at the Richards' house and\r\nknocked.  Mrs. Richards peeped through the shutters, then went and\r\nreceived the envelope, and the stranger disappeared without a word.  She\r\ncame back flushed and a little unsteady on her legs, and gasped out:\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I recognised him!  Last night it seemed to me that maybe I had\r\nseen him somewhere before.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is the man that brought the sack here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am almost sure of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he is the ostensible Stephenson too, and sold every important\r\ncitizen in this town with his bogus secret.  Now if he has sent cheques\r\ninstead of money, we are sold too, after we thought we had escaped.  I\r\nwas beginning to feel fairly comfortable once more, after my night's\r\nrest, but the look of that envelope makes me sick.  It isn't fat enough;\r\n$8,500 in even the largest bank-notes makes more bulk than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Edward, why do you object to cheques?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheques signed by Stephenson!  I am resigned to take the $8,500 if it\r\ncould come in bank-notes--for it does seem that it was so ordered,\r\nMary--but I have never had much courage, and I have not the pluck to try\r\nto market a cheque signed with that disastrous name.  It would be a trap.\r\nThat man tried to catch me; we escaped somehow or other; and now he is\r\ntrying a new way.  If it is cheques--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Edward, it is _too_ bad!\"  And she held up the cheques and began to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n\"Put them in the fire! quick! we mustn't be tempted.  It is a trick to\r\nmake the world laugh at _us_, along with the rest, and--Give them to\r\n_me_, since you can't do it!\"  He snatched them and tried to hold his\r\ngrip till he could get to the stove; but he was human, he was a cashier,\r\nand he stopped a moment to make sure of the signature.  Then he came near\r\nto fainting.\r\n\r\n\"Fan me, Mary, fan me!  They are the same as gold!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how lovely, Edward!  Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Signed by Harkness.  What can the mystery of that be, Mary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Edward, do you think--\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here--look at this!  Fifteen--fifteen--fifteen--thirty-four.  Thirty-\r\neight thousand five hundred!  Mary, the sack isn't worth twelve dollars,\r\nand Harkness--apparently--has paid about par for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does it all come to us, do you think--instead of the ten thousand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it looks like it.  And the cheques are made to 'Bearer,' too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that good, Edward?  What is it for?\"\r\n\r\n\"A hint to collect them at some distant bank, I reckon.  Perhaps Harkness\r\ndoesn't want the matter known.  What is that--a note?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  It was with the cheques.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the \"Stephenson\" handwriting, but there was no signature.  It\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n   \"I am a disappointed man.  Your honesty is beyond the reach of\r\n   temptation.  I had a different idea about it, but I wronged you in\r\n   that, and I beg pardon, and do it sincerely.  I honour you--and that\r\n   is sincere too.  This town is not worthy to kiss the hem of your\r\n   garment.  Dear sir, I made a square bet with myself that there were\r\n   nineteen debauchable men in your self-righteous community.  I have\r\n   lost.  Take the whole pot, you are entitled to it.\"\r\n\r\nRichards drew a deep sigh, and said:\r\n\r\n\"It seems written with fire--it burns so.  Mary--I am miserable again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, too.  Ah, dear, I wish--\"\r\n\r\n\"To think, Mary--he _believes_ in me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't, Edward--I can't bear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If those beautiful words were deserved, Mary--and God knows I believed I\r\ndeserved them once--I think I could give the forty thousand dollars for\r\nthem.  And I would put that paper away, as representing more than gold\r\nand jewels, and keep it always.  But now--We could not live in the shadow\r\nof its accusing presence, Mary.\"\r\n\r\nHe put it in the fire.\r\n\r\nA messenger arrived and delivered an envelope.  Richards took from it a\r\nnote and read it; it was from Burgess:\r\n\r\n   \"You saved me, in a difficult time.  I saved you last night.  It was\r\n   at cost of a lie, but I made the sacrifice freely, and out of a\r\n   grateful heart.  None in this village knows so well as I know how\r\n   brave and good and noble you are.  At bottom you cannot respect me,\r\n   knowing as you do of that matter of which I am accused, and by the\r\n   general voice condemned; but I beg that you will at least believe that\r\n   I am a grateful man; it will help me to bear my burden.  [Signed]\r\n   'BURGESS.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Saved, once more.  And on such terms!\"  He put the note in the lire.\r\n\"I--I wish I were dead, Mary, I wish I were out of it all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, these are bitter, bitter days, Edward.  The stabs, through their\r\nvery generosity, are so deep--and they come so fast!\"\r\n\r\nThree days before the election each of two thousand voters suddenly found\r\nhimself in possession of a prized memento--one of the renowned bogus\r\ndouble-eagles.  Around one of its faces was stamped these words: \"THE\r\nREMARK I MADE TO THE POOR STRANGER WAS--\"  Around the other face was\r\nstamped these: \"GO, AND REFORM.  [SIGNED] PINKERTON.\"  Thus the entire\r\nremaining refuse of the renowned joke was emptied upon a single head, and\r\nwith calamitous effect.  It revived the recent vast laugh and\r\nconcentrated it upon Pinkerton; and Harkness's election was a walk-over.\r\n\r\nWithin twenty-four hours after the Richardses had received their cheques\r\ntheir consciences were quieting down, discouraged; the old couple were\r\nlearning to reconcile themselves to the sin which they had committed.  But\r\nthey were to learn, now, that a sin takes on new and real terrors when\r\nthere seems a chance that it is going to be found out.  This gives it a\r\nfresh and most substantial and important aspect.  At church the morning\r\nsermon was of the usual pattern; it was the same old things said in the\r\nsame old way; they had heard them a thousand times and found them\r\ninnocuous, next to meaningless, and easy to sleep under; but now it was\r\ndifferent: the sermon seemed to bristle with accusations; it seemed aimed\r\nstraight and specially at people who were concealing deadly sins.  After\r\nchurch they got away from the mob of congratulators as soon as they\r\ncould, and hurried homeward, chilled to the bone at they did not know\r\nwhat--vague, shadowy, indefinite fears.  And by chance they caught a\r\nglimpse of Mr. Burgess as he turned a corner.  He paid no attention to\r\ntheir nod of recognition!  He hadn't seen it; but they did not know that.\r\nWhat could his conduct mean?  It might mean--it might--mean--oh, a dozen\r\ndreadful things.  Was it possible that he knew that Richards could have\r\ncleared him of guilt in that bygone time, and had been silently waiting\r\nfor a chance to even up accounts?  At home, in their distress they got to\r\nimagining that their servant might have been in the next room listening\r\nwhen Richards revealed the secret to his wife that he knew of Burgess's\r\ninnocence; next Richards began to imagine that he had heard the swish of\r\na gown in there at that time; next, he was sure he _had_ heard it.  They\r\nwould call Sarah in, on a pretext, and watch her face; if she had been\r\nbetraying them to Mr. Burgess, it would show in her manner.  They asked\r\nher some questions--questions which were so random and incoherent and\r\nseemingly purposeless that the girl felt sure that the old people's minds\r\nhad been affected by their sudden good fortune; the sharp and watchful\r\ngaze which they bent upon her frightened her, and that completed the\r\nbusiness.  She blushed, she became nervous and confused, and to the old\r\npeople these were plain signs of guilt--guilt of some fearful sort or\r\nother--without doubt she was a spy and a traitor.  When they were alone\r\nagain they began to piece many unrelated things together and get horrible\r\nresults out of the combination.  When things had got about to the worst\r\nRichards was delivered of a sudden gasp and his wife asked:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what is it?--what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The note--Burgess's note!  Its language was sarcastic, I see it now.\"  He\r\nquoted: \"'At bottom you cannot respect me, _knowing_, as you do, of _that\r\nmatter of_ which I am accused'--oh, it is perfectly plain, now, God help\r\nme!  He knows that I know!  You see the ingenuity of the phrasing.  It\r\nwas a trap--and like a fool, I walked into it.  And Mary--!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is dreadful--I know what you are going to say--he didn't return\r\nyour transcript of the pretended test-remark.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--kept it to destroy us with.  Mary, he has exposed us to some\r\nalready.  I know it--I know it well.  I saw it in a dozen faces after\r\nchurch.  Ah, he wouldn't answer our nod of recognition--he knew what he\r\nhad been doing!\"\r\n\r\nIn the night the doctor was called.  The news went around in the morning\r\nthat the old couple were rather seriously ill--prostrated by the\r\nexhausting excitement growing out of their great windfall, the\r\ncongratulations, and the late hours, the doctor said.  The town was\r\nsincerely distressed; for these old people were about all it had left to\r\nbe proud of, now.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the news was worse.  The old couple were delirious, and\r\nwere doing strange things.  By witness of the nurses, Richards had\r\nexhibited cheques--for $8,500?  No--for an amazing sum--$38,500!  What\r\ncould be the explanation of this gigantic piece of luck?\r\n\r\nThe following day the nurses had more news--and wonderful.  They had\r\nconcluded to hide the cheques, lest harm come to them; but when they\r\nsearched they were gone from under the patient's pillow--vanished away.\r\nThe patient said:\r\n\r\n\"Let the pillow alone; what do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"We thought it best that the cheques--\"\r\n\r\n\"You will never see them again--they are destroyed.  They came from\r\nSatan.  I saw the hell-brand on them, and I knew they were sent to betray\r\nme to sin.\"  Then he fell to gabbling strange and dreadful things which\r\nwere not clearly understandable, and which the doctor admonished them to\r\nkeep to themselves.\r\n\r\nRichards was right; the cheques were never seen again.\r\n\r\nA nurse must have talked in her sleep, for within two days the forbidden\r\ngabblings were the property of the town; and they were of a surprising\r\nsort.  They seemed to indicate that Richards had been a claimant for the\r\nsack himself, and that Burgess had concealed that fact and then\r\nmaliciously betrayed it.\r\n\r\nBurgess was taxed with this and stoutly denied it.  And he said it was\r\nnot fair to attach weight to the chatter of a sick old man who was out of\r\nhis mind.  Still, suspicion was in the air, and there was much talk.\r\n\r\nAfter a day or two it was reported that Mrs. Richards's delirious\r\ndeliveries were getting to be duplicates of her husband's.  Suspicion\r\nflamed up into conviction, now, and the town's pride in the purity of its\r\none undiscredited important citizen began to dim down and flicker toward\r\nextinction.\r\n\r\nSix days passed, then came more news.  The old couple were dying.\r\nRichards's mind cleared in his latest hour, and he sent for Burgess.\r\nBurgess said:\r\n\r\n\"Let the room be cleared.  I think he wishes to say something in\r\nprivacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Richards; \"I want witnesses.  I want you all to hear my\r\nconfession, so that I may die a man, and not a dog.  I was\r\nclean--artificially--like the rest; and like the rest I fell when\r\ntemptation came.  I signed a lie, and claimed the miserable sack.  Mr.\r\nBurgess remembered that I had done him a service, and in gratitude (and\r\nignorance) he suppressed my claim and saved me.  You know the thing that\r\nwas charged against Burgess years ago.  My testimony, and mine alone,\r\ncould have cleared him, and I was a coward and left him to suffer\r\ndisgrace--\"\r\n\r\n\"No--no--Mr. Richards, you--\"\r\n\r\n\"My servant betrayed my secret to him--\"\r\n\r\n\"No one has betrayed anything to me--\"\r\n\r\n--\"And then he did a natural and justifiable thing; he repented of the\r\nsaving kindness which he had done me, and he _exposed_ me--as I\r\ndeserved--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!--I make oath--\"\r\n\r\n\"Out of my heart I forgive him.\"\r\n\r\nBurgess's impassioned protestations fell upon deaf ears; the dying man\r\npassed away without knowing that once more he had done poor Burgess a\r\nwrong.  The old wife died that night.\r\n\r\nThe last of the sacred Nineteen had fallen a prey to the fiendish sack;\r\nthe town was stripped of the last rag of its ancient glory.  Its mourning\r\nwas not showy, but it was deep.\r\n\r\nBy act of the Legislature--upon prayer and petition--Hadleyburg was\r\nallowed to change its name to (never mind what--I will not give it away),\r\nand leave one word out of the motto that for many generations had graced\r\nthe town's official seal.\r\n\r\nIt is an honest town once more, and the man will have to rise early that\r\ncatches it napping again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Paragraphs":["***\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscribed from the 1907 Chatto & Windus edition by David Price, email\nccx074@coventry.ac.uk\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN THAT CORRUPTED HADLEYBURG\n\n\nI.\n\n\nIt was many years ago.  Hadleyburg was the most honest and upright town\nin all the region round about.  It had kept that reputation unsmirched\nduring three generations, and was prouder of it than of any other of its\npossessions.  It was so proud of it, and so anxious to insure its\nperpetuation, that it began to teach the principles of honest dealing to\nits babies in the cradle, and made the like teachings the staple of their\nculture thenceforward through all the years devoted to their education.\nAlso, throughout the formative years temptations were kept out of the way\nof the young people, so that their honesty could have every chance to\r\nharden and solidify, and become a part of their very bone.  The\nneighbouring towns were jealous of this honourable supremacy, and\naffected to sneer at Hadleyburg's pride in it and call it vanity; but all\nthe same they were obliged to acknowledge that Hadleyburg was in reality\nan incorruptible town; and if pressed they would also acknowledge that\nthe mere fact that a young man hailed from Hadleyburg was all the\nrecommendation he needed when he went forth from his natal town to seek\nfor responsible employment.\n\nBut at last, in the drift of time, Hadleyburg had the ill luck to offend\na passing stranger--possibly without knowing it, certainly without\ncaring, for Hadleyburg was sufficient unto itself, and cared not a rap\nfor strangers or their opinions.  Still, it would have been well to make\r\nan exception in this one's case, for he was a bitter man, and revengeful.\nAll through his wanderings during a whole year he kept his injury in\nmind, and gave all his leisure moments to trying to invent a compensating\nsatisfaction for it.  He contrived many plans, and all of them were good,\nbut none of them was quite sweeping enough: the poorest of them would\nhurt a great many individuals, but what he wanted was a plan which would\ncomprehend the entire town, and not let so much as one person escape\nunhurt.  At last he had a fortunate idea, and when it fell into his brain\nit lit up his whole head with an evil joy.  He began to form a plan at\nonce, saying to himself \"That is the thing to do--I will corrupt the\ntown.\"\n\nSix months later he went to Hadleyburg, and arrived in a buggy at the house of the old cashier of the bank about ten at night.  He got a sack\n","house of the old cashier of the bank about ten at night.  He got a sack\nout of the buggy, shouldered it, and staggered with it through the\ncottage yard, and knocked at the door.  A woman's voice said \"Come in,\"\nand he entered, and set his sack behind the stove in the parlour, saying\npolitely to the old lady who sat reading the \"Missionary Herald\" by the\nlamp:\n\n\"Pray keep your seat, madam, I will not disturb you.  There--now it is\npretty well concealed; one would hardly know it was there.  Can I see\nyour husband a moment, madam?\"\n\nNo, he was gone to Brixton, and might not return before morning.\n\n\"Very well, madam, it is no matter.  I merely wanted to leave that sack\nin his care, to be delivered to the rightful owner when he shall be\r\nfound.  I am a stranger; he does not know me; I am merely passing through\nthe town to-night to discharge a matter which has been long in my mind.\nMy errand is now completed, and I go pleased and a little proud, and you\nwill never see me again.  There is a paper attached to the sack which\nwill explain everything.  Good-night, madam.\"\n\nThe old lady was afraid of the mysterious big stranger, and was glad to\r\nsee him go.  But her curiosity was roused, and she went straight to the\nsack and brought away the paper.  It began as follows:\n\n   \"TO BE PUBLISHED, or, the right man sought out by private\n   inquiry--either will answer.  This sack contains gold coin weighing a\n   hundred and sixty pounds four ounces--\"\n\n\"Mercy on us, and the door not locked!\"\n\nMrs. Richards flew to it all in a tremble and locked it, then pulled down\r\nthe window-shades and stood frightened, worried, and wondering if there\nwas anything else she could do toward making herself and the money more\nsafe.  She listened awhile for burglars, then surrendered to curiosity,\nand went back to the lamp and finished reading the paper:\n\n   \"I am a foreigner, and am presently going back to my own country, to\n   remain there permanently.  I am grateful to America for what I have\n   received at her hands during my long stay under her flag; and to one\n   of her citizens--a citizen of Hadleyburg--I am especially grateful for\n   a great kindness done me a year or two ago.  Two great kindnesses in\n   fact.  I will explain.  I was a gambler.  I say I WAS.  I was a ruined\n   gambler.  I arrived in this village at night, hungry and without a penny.  I asked for help--in the dark; I was ashamed to beg in the\n","penny.  I asked for help--in the dark; I was ashamed to beg in the\n   light.  I begged of the right man.  He gave me twenty dollars--that is\n   to say, he gave me life, as I considered it.  He also gave me fortune;\n   for out of that money I have made myself rich at the gaming-table.  And\n   finally, a remark which he made to me has remained with me to this\n   day, and has at last conquered me; and in conquering has saved the\n   remnant of my morals: I shall gamble no more.  Now I have no idea who\n   that man was, but I want him found, and I want him to have this money,\n   to give away, throw away, or keep, as he pleases.  It is merely my way\n   of testifying my gratitude to him.  If I could stay, I would find him\n   myself; but no matter, he will be found.  This is an honest town, an\r\nincorruptible town, and I know I can trust it without fear.  This man\n   can be identified by the remark which he made to me; I feel persuaded\n   that he will remember it.\n\n   \"And now my plan is this: If you prefer to conduct the inquiry\n   privately, do so.  Tell the contents of this present writing to any\n   one who is likely to be the right man.  If he shall answer, 'I am the\n   man; the remark I made was so-and-so,' apply the test--to wit: open\n   the sack, and in it you will find a sealed envelope containing that\n   remark.  If the remark mentioned by the candidate tallies with it,\n   give him the money, and ask no further questions, for he is certainly\n   the right man.\n\n   \"But if you shall prefer a public inquiry, then publish this present\r\nwriting in the local paper--with these instructions added, to wit:\n   Thirty days from now, let the candidate appear at the town-hall at\n   eight in the evening (Friday), and hand his remark, in a sealed\n   envelope, to the Rev. Mr. Burgess (if he will be kind enough to act);\n   and let Mr. Burgess there and then destroy the seals of the sack, open\n   it, and see if the remark is correct: if correct, let the money be\n   delivered, with my sincere gratitude, to my benefactor thus\n   identified.\"\n\nMrs. Richards sat down, gently quivering with excitement, and was soon\nlost in thinkings--after this pattern: \"What a strange thing it is! . . .\nAnd what a fortune for that kind man who set his bread afloat upon the\nwaters! . . . If it had only been my husband that did it!--for we are so poor, so old and poor! . . .\"  Then, with a sigh--\"But it was not my\n","poor, so old and poor! . . .\"  Then, with a sigh--\"But it was not my\nEdward; no, it was not he that gave a stranger twenty dollars.  It is a\npity too; I see it now. . . \"  Then, with a shudder--\"But it is\n_gamblers_' money! the wages of sin; we couldn't take it; we couldn't\ntouch it.  I don't like to be near it; it seems a defilement.\"  She moved\nto a farther chair. . . \"I wish Edward would come, and take it to the\nbank; a burglar might come at any moment; it is dreadful to be here all\nalone with it.\"\n\nAt eleven Mr. Richards arrived, and while his wife was saying \"I am _so_\nglad you've come!\" he was saying, \"I am so tired--tired clear out; it is\ndreadful to be poor, and have to make these dismal journeys at my time of\nlife.  Always at the grind, grind, grind, on a salary--another man's\r\nslave, and he sitting at home in his slippers, rich and comfortable.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry for you, Edward, you know that; but be comforted; we have\nour livelihood; we have our good name--\"\n\n\"Yes, Mary, and that is everything.  Don't mind my talk--it's just a\nmoment's irritation and doesn't mean anything.  Kiss me--there, it's all\ngone now, and I am not complaining any more.  What have you been getting?\nWhat's in the sack?\"\n\nThen his wife told him the great secret.  It dazed him for a moment; then\nhe said:\n\n\"It weighs a hundred and sixty pounds?  Why, Mary, it's for-ty thou-sand\ndollars--think of it--a whole fortune!  Not ten men in this village are\nworth that much.  Give me the paper.\"\n\nHe skimmed through it and said:\n\n\"Isn't it an adventure!  Why, it's a romance; it's like the impossible\r\nthings one reads about in books, and never sees in life.\"  He was well\nstirred up now; cheerful, even gleeful.  He tapped his old wife on the\ncheek, and said humorously, \"Why, we're rich, Mary, rich; all we've got\nto do is to bury the money and burn the papers.  If the gambler ever\ncomes to inquire, we'll merely look coldly upon him and say: 'What is\nthis nonsense you are talking?  We have never heard of you and your sack\nof gold before;' and then he would look foolish, and--\"\n\n\"And in the meantime, while you are running on with your jokes, the money\nis still here, and it is fast getting along toward burglar-time.\"\n\n\"True.  Very well, what shall we do--make the inquiry private?  No, not\nthat; it would spoil the romance.  The public method is better.  Think what a noise it will make!  And it will make all the other towns jealous;\n","what a noise it will make!  And it will make all the other towns jealous;\nfor no stranger would trust such a thing to any town but Hadleyburg, and\nthey know it.  It's a great card for us.  I must get to the\nprinting-office now, or I shall be too late.\"\n\n\"But stop--stop--don't leave me here alone with it, Edward!\"\n\nBut he was gone.  For only a little while, however.  Not far from his own\nhouse he met the editor--proprietor of the paper, and gave him the\ndocument, and said \"Here is a good thing for you, Cox--put it in.\"\n\n\"It may be too late, Mr. Richards, but I'll see.\"\n\nAt home again, he and his wife sat down to talk the charming mystery\nover; they were in no condition for sleep.  The first question was, Who\ncould the citizen have been who gave the stranger the twenty dollars?  It\r\nseemed a simple one; both answered it in the same breath--\n\n\"Barclay Goodson.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Richards, \"he could have done it, and it would have been like\nhim, but there's not another in the town.\"\n\n\"Everybody will grant that, Edward--grant it privately, anyway.  For six\nmonths, now, the village has been its own proper self once more--honest,\nnarrow, self-righteous, and stingy.\"\n\n\"It is what he always called it, to the day of his death--said it right\nout publicly, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, and he was hated for it.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course; but he didn't care.  I reckon he was the best-hated man\namong us, except the Reverend Burgess.\"\n\n\"Well, Burgess deserves it--he will never get another congregation here.\nMean as the town is, it knows how to estimate _him_.  Edward, doesn't it\r\nseem odd that the stranger should appoint Burgess to deliver the money?\"\n\n\"Well, yes--it does.  That is--that is--\"\n\n\"Why so much that-_is_-ing?  Would _you_ select him?\"\n\n\"Mary, maybe the stranger knows him better than this village does.\"\n\n\"Much _that_ would help Burgess!\"\n\nThe husband seemed perplexed for an answer; the wife kept a steady eye\nupon him, and waited.  Finally Richards said, with the hesitancy of one\nwho is making a statement which is likely to encounter doubt,\n\n\"Mary, Burgess is not a bad man.\"\n\nHis wife was certainly surprised.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"He is not a bad man.  I know.  The whole of his unpopularity had its\nfoundation in that one thing--the thing that made so much noise.\"\n\n\"That 'one thing,' indeed!  As if that 'one thing' wasn't enough, all by itself.\"\n\n\"Plenty.  Plenty.  Only he wasn't guilty of it.\"\n","itself.\"\n\n\"Plenty.  Plenty.  Only he wasn't guilty of it.\"\n\n\"How you talk!  Not guilty of it!  Everybody knows he _was_ guilty.\"\n\n\"Mary, I give you my word--he was innocent.\"\n\n\"I can't believe it and I don't.  How do you know?\"\n\n\"It is a confession.  I am ashamed, but I will make it.  I was the only\nman who knew he was innocent.  I could have saved him, and--and--well,\nyou know how the town was wrought up--I hadn't the pluck to do it.  It\nwould have turned everybody against me.  I felt mean, ever so mean; ut I\ndidn't dare; I hadn't the manliness to face that.\"\n\nMary looked troubled, and for a while was silent.  Then she said\nstammeringly:\n\n\"I--I don't think it would have done for you to--to--One\nmustn't--er--public opinion--one has to be so careful--so--\"  It was a\r\ndifficult road, and she got mired; but after a little she got started\nagain.  \"It was a great pity, but--Why, we couldn't afford it, Edward--we\ncouldn't indeed.  Oh, I wouldn't have had you do it for anything!\"\n\n\"It would have lost us the good-will of so many people, Mary; and\nthen--and then--\"\n\n\"What troubles me now is, what _he_ thinks of us, Edward.\"\n\n\"He?  _He_ doesn't suspect that I could have saved him.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed the wife, in a tone of relief, \"I am glad of that.  As\nlong as he doesn't know that you could have saved him, he--he--well that\nmakes it a great deal better.  Why, I might have known he didn't know,\nbecause he is always trying to be friendly with us, as little\nencouragement as we give him.  More than once people have twitted me with\r\nit.  There's the Wilsons, and the Wilcoxes, and the Harknesses, they take\na mean pleasure in saying '_Your friend_ Burgess,' because they know it\npesters me.  I wish he wouldn't persist in liking us so; I can't think\nwhy he keeps it up.\"\n\n\"I can explain it.  It's another confession.  When the thing was new and\nhot, and the town made a plan to ride him on a rail, my conscience hurt\nme so that I couldn't stand it, and I went privately and gave him notice,\nand he got out of the town and stayed out till it was safe to come back.\"\n\n\"Edward!  If the town had found it out--\"\n\n\"_Don't_!  It scares me yet, to think of it.  I repented of it the minute\nit was done; and I was even afraid to tell you lest your face might\nbetray it to somebody.  I didn't sleep any that night, for worrying.  But after a few days I saw that no one was going to suspect me, and after\n","after a few days I saw that no one was going to suspect me, and after\nthat I got to feeling glad I did it.  And I feel glad yet, Mary--glad\nthrough and through.\"\n\n\"So do I, now, for it would have been a dreadful way to treat him.  Yes,\nI'm glad; for really you did owe him that, you know.  But, Edward,\nsuppose it should come out yet, some day!\"\n\n\"It won't.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because everybody thinks it was Goodson.\"\n\n\"Of course they would!\"\n\n\"Certainly.  And of course _he_ didn't care.  They persuaded poor old\nSawlsberry to go and charge it on him, and he went blustering over there\nand did it.  Goodson looked him over, like as if he was hunting for a\nplace on him that he could despise the most; then he says, 'So you are\nthe Committee of Inquiry, are you?'  Sawlsberry said that was about what\r\nhe was.  'H'm.  Do they require particulars, or do you reckon a kind of a\n_general_ answer will do?'  'If they require particulars, I will come\nback, Mr. Goodson; I will take the general answer first.'  'Very well,\nthen, tell them to go to hell--I reckon that's general enough.  And I'll\ngive you some advice, Sawlsberry; when you come back for the particulars,\nfetch a basket to carry what is left of yourself home in.'\"\r\n\"Just like Goodson; it's got all the marks.  He had only one vanity; he\nthought he could give advice better than any other person.\"\n\n\"It settled the business, and saved us, Mary.  The subject was dropped.\"\n\n\"Bless you, I'm not doubting _that_.\"\n\nThen they took up the gold-sack mystery again, with strong interest.  Soon\nthe conversation began to suffer breaks--interruptions caused by absorbed\r\nthinkings.  The breaks grew more and more frequent.  At last Richards\nlost himself wholly in thought.  He sat long, gazing vacantly at the\nfloor, and by-and-by he began to punctuate his thoughts with little\nnervous movements of his hands that seemed to indicate vexation.  Meantime\nhis wife too had relapsed into a thoughtful silence, and her movements\nwere beginning to show a troubled discomfort.  Finally Richards got up\nand strode aimlessly about the room, ploughing his hands through his\nhair, much as a somnambulist might do who was having a bad dream.  Then\nhe seemed to arrive at a definite purpose; and without a word he put on\nhis hat and passed quickly out of the house.  His wife sat brooding, with\na drawn face, and did not seem to be aware that she was alone.  Now and then she murmured, \"Lead us not into t . . . but--but--we are so poor, so\n","then she murmured, \"Lead us not into t . . . but--but--we are so poor, so\npoor! . . . Lead us not into . . . Ah, who would be hurt by it?--and no\none would ever know . . . Lead us . . . \"  The voice died out in\nmumblings.  After a little she glanced up and muttered in a\nhalf-frightened, half-glad way--\n\n\"He is gone!  But, oh dear, he may be too late--too late . . . Maybe\r\nnot--maybe there is still time.\"  She rose and stood thinking, nervously\nclasping and unclasping her hands.  A slight shudder shook her frame, and\nshe said, out of a dry throat, \"God forgive me--it's awful to think such\nthings--but . . . Lord, how we are made--how strangely we are made!\"\n\nShe turned the light low, and slipped stealthily over and knelt down by\nthe sack and felt of its ridgy sides with her hands, and fondled them\r\nlovingly; and there was a gloating light in her poor old eyes.  She fell\ninto fits of absence; and came half out of them at times to mutter \"If we\nhad only waited!--oh, if we had only waited a little, and not been in\nsuch a hurry!\"\n\nMeantime Cox had gone home from his office and told his wife all about\nthe strange thing that had happened, and they had talked it over eagerly,\r\nand guessed that the late Goodson was the only man in the town who could\nhave helped a suffering stranger with so noble a sum as twenty dollars.\nThen there was a pause, and the two became thoughtful and silent.  And by-\nand-by nervous and fidgety.  At last the wife said, as if to herself,\n\n\"Nobody knows this secret but the Richardses . . . and us . . . nobody.\"\n\nThe husband came out of his thinkings with a slight start, and gazed\r\nwistfully at his wife, whose face was become very pale; then he\nhesitatingly rose, and glanced furtively at his hat, then at his wife--a\nsort of mute inquiry.  Mrs. Cox swallowed once or twice, with her hand at\nher throat, then in place of speech she nodded her head.  In a moment she\nwas alone, and mumbling to herself.\n\nAnd now Richards and Cox were hurrying through the deserted streets, from\nopposite directions.  They met, panting, at the foot of the\nprinting-office stairs; by the night-light there they read each other's\nface.  Cox whispered:\n\n\"Nobody knows about this but us?\"\n\nThe whispered answer was:\n\n\"Not a soul--on honour, not a soul!\"\n\n\"If it isn't too late to--\"\n\nThe men were starting up-stairs; at this moment they were overtaken by a boy, and Cox asked,\n\n\"Is that you, Johnny?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n","boy, and Cox asked,\n\n\"Is that you, Johnny?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You needn't ship the early mail--nor _any_ mail; wait till I tell you.\"\n\n\"It's already gone, sir.\"\n\n\"_Gone_?\"  It had the sound of an unspeakable disappointment in it.\n\n\"Yes, sir.  Time-table for Brixton and all the towns beyond changed to-\nday, sir--had to get the papers in twenty minutes earlier than common.  I\nhad to rush; if I had been two minutes later--\"\r\nThe men turned and walked slowly away, not waiting to hear the rest.\nNeither of them spoke during ten minutes; then Cox said, in a vexed tone,\n\n\"What possessed you to be in such a hurry, _I_ can't make out.\"\n\nThe answer was humble enough:\n\n\"I see it now, but somehow I never thought, you know, until it was too\nlate.  But the next time--\"\n\n\"Next time be hanged!  It won't come in a thousand years.\"\r\nThen the friends separated without a good-night, and dragged themselves\nhome with the gait of mortally stricken men.  At their homes their wives\nsprang up with an eager \"Well?\"--then saw the answer with their eyes and\nsank down sorrowing, without waiting for it to come in words.  In both\nhouses a discussion followed of a heated sort--a new thing; there had\nbeen discussions before, but not heated ones, not ungentle ones.  The\ndiscussions to-night were a sort of seeming plagiarisms of each other.\nMrs. Richards said:\n\n\"If you had only waited, Edward--if you had only stopped to think; but\nno, you must run straight to the printing-office and spread it all over\nthe world.\"\n\n\"It _said_ publish it.\"\n\n\"That is nothing; it also said do it privately, if you liked.  There,\r\nnow--is that true, or not?\"\n\n\"Why, yes--yes, it is true; but when I thought what a stir it would make,\nand what a compliment it was to Hadleyburg that a stranger should trust\nit so--\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly, I know all that; but if you had only stopped to think,\nyou would have seen that you _couldn't_ find the right man, because he is\nin his grave, and hasn't left chick nor child nor relation behind him;\nand as long as the money went to somebody that awfully needed it, and\nnobody would be hurt by it, and--and--\"\n\nShe broke down, crying.  Her husband tried to think of some comforting\nthing to say, and presently came out with this:\n\n\"But after all, Mary, it must be for the best--it must be; we know that.\nAnd we must remember that it was so ordered--\" \"Ordered!  Oh, everything's _ordered_, when a person has to find some way\n","\"Ordered!  Oh, everything's _ordered_, when a person has to find some way\nout when he has been stupid. Just the same, it was _ordered_ that the\nmoney should come to us in this special way, and it was you that must\ntake it on yourself to go meddling with the designs of Providence--and\nwho gave you the right?  It was wicked, that is what it was--just\nblasphemous presumption, and no more becoming to a meek and humble\nprofessor of--\"\n\n\"But, Mary, you know how we have been trained all our lives long, like\nthe whole village, till it is absolutely second nature to us to stop not\na single moment to think when there's an honest thing to be done--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know it, I know it--it's been one everlasting training and\ntraining and training in honesty--honesty shielded, from the very cradle,\r\nagainst every possible temptation, and so it's _artificial_ honesty, and\nweak as water when temptation comes, as we have seen this night.  God\nknows I never had shade nor shadow of a doubt of my petrified and\nindestructible honesty until now--and now, under the very first big and\nreal temptation, I--Edward, it is my belief that this town's honesty is\nas rotten as mine is; as rotten as yours.  It is a mean town, a hard,\nstingy town, and hasn't a virtue in the world but this honesty it is so\ncelebrated for and so conceited about; and so help me, I do believe that\nif ever the day comes that its honesty falls under great temptation, its\ngrand reputation will go to ruin like a house of cards.  There, now, I've\nmade confession, and I feel better; I am a humbug, and I've been one all\r\nmy life, without knowing it.  Let no man call me honest again--I will not\nhave it.\"\n\n\"I--Well, Mary, I feel a good deal as you do: I certainly do.  It seems\nstrange, too, so strange.  I never could have believed it--never.\"\n\nA long silence followed; both were sunk in thought.  At last the wife\nlooked up and said:\n\n\"I know what you are thinking, Edward.\"\n\nRichards had the embarrassed look of a person who is caught.\n\n\"I am ashamed to confess it, Mary, but--\"\n\n\"It's no matter, Edward, I was thinking the same question myself.\"\n\n\"I hope so.  State it.\"\n\n\"You were thinking, if a body could only guess out _what the remark was_\nthat Goodson made to the stranger.\"\n\n\"It's perfectly true.  I feel guilty and ashamed.  And you?\"\n\n\"I'm past it.  Let us make a pallet here; we've got to stand watch till the bank vault opens in the morning and admits the sack. . . Oh dear, oh\n","the bank vault opens in the morning and admits the sack. . . Oh dear, oh\ndear--if we hadn't made the mistake!\"\n\nThe pallet was made, and Mary said:\n\n\"The open sesame--what could it have been?  I do wonder what that remark\ncould have been.  But come; we will get to bed now.\"\n\n\"And sleep?\"\n\n\"No; think.\"\n\n\"Yes; think.\"\n\nBy this time the Coxes too had completed their spat and their\r\nreconciliation, and were turning in--to think, to think, and toss, and\nfret, and worry over what the remark could possibly have been which\nGoodson made to the stranded derelict; that golden remark; that remark\nworth forty thousand dollars, cash.\n\nThe reason that the village telegraph-office was open later than usual\nthat night was this: The foreman of Cox's paper was the local\nrepresentative of the Associated Press.  One might say its honorary\r\nrepresentative, for it wasn't four times a year that he could furnish\nthirty words that would be accepted.  But this time it was different.  His\ndespatch stating what he had caught got an instant answer:\n\n   \"Send the whole thing--all the details--twelve hundred words.\"\n\nA colossal order!  The foreman filled the bill; and he was the proudest\nman in the State.  By breakfast-time the next morning the name of\nHadleyburg the Incorruptible was on every lip in America, from Montreal\nto the Gulf, from the glaciers of Alaska to the orange-groves of Florida;\nand millions and millions of people were discussing the stranger and his\nmoney-sack, and wondering if the right man would be found, and hoping\nsome more news about the matter would come soon--right away.\n\n\n\n\nII.\r\nHadleyburg village woke up world-celebrated--astonished--happy--vain.\nVain beyond imagination.  Its nineteen principal citizens and their wives\nwent about shaking hands with each other, and beaming, and smiling, and\ncongratulating, and saying _this_ thing adds a new word to the\ndictionary--_Hadleyburg_, synonym for _incorruptible_--destined to live\nin dictionaries for ever!  And the minor and unimportant citizens and\ntheir wives went around acting in much the same way.  Everybody ran to\nthe bank to see the gold-sack; and before noon grieved and envious crowds\nbegan to flock in from Brixton and all neighbouring towns; and that\nafternoon and next day reporters began to arrive from everywhere to\nverify the sack and its history and write the whole thing up anew, and make dashing free-hand pictures of the sack, and of Richards's house, and\n","make dashing free-hand pictures of the sack, and of Richards's house, and\nthe bank, and the Presbyterian church, and the Baptist church, and the\npublic square, and the town-hall where the test would be applied and the\nmoney delivered; and damnable portraits of the Richardses, and Pinkerton\nthe banker, and Cox, and the foreman, and Reverend Burgess, and the\npostmaster--and even of Jack Halliday, who was the loafing, good-natured,\nno-account, irreverent fisherman, hunter, boys' friend, stray-dogs'\nfriend, typical \"Sam Lawson\" of the town.  The little mean, smirking,\noily Pinkerton showed the sack to all comers, and rubbed his sleek palms\ntogether pleasantly, and enlarged upon the town's fine old reputation for\nhonesty and upon this wonderful endorsement of it, and hoped and believed\r\nthat the example would now spread far and wide over the American world,\nand be epoch-making in the matter of moral regeneration.  And so on, and\nso on.\n\nBy the end of a week things had quieted down again; the wild intoxication\nof pride and joy had sobered to a soft, sweet, silent delight--a sort of\ndeep, nameless, unutterable content.  All faces bore a look of peaceful,\nholy happiness.\n\nThen a change came.  It was a gradual change; so gradual that its\nbeginnings were hardly noticed; maybe were not noticed at all, except by\nJack Halliday, who always noticed everything; and always made fun of it,\ntoo, no matter what it was.  He began to throw out chaffing remarks about\npeople not looking quite so happy as they did a day or two ago; and next\r\nhe claimed that the new aspect was deepening to positive sadness; next,\nthat it was taking on a sick look; and finally he said that everybody was\nbecome so moody, thoughtful, and absent-minded that he could rob the\nmeanest man in town of a cent out of the bottom of his breeches pocket\nand not disturb his reverie.\n\nAt this stage--or at about this stage--a saying like this was dropped at\r\nbedtime--with a sigh, usually--by the head of each of the nineteen\nprincipal households:\n\n\"Ah, what _could_ have been the remark that Goodson made?\"\n\nAnd straightway--with a shudder--came this, from the man's wife:\n\n\"Oh, _don't_!  What horrible thing are you mulling in your mind?  Put it\naway from you, for God's sake!\"\n\nBut that question was wrung from those men again the next night--and got\nthe same retort.  But weaker. And the third night the men uttered the question yet again--with anguish,\n","And the third night the men uttered the question yet again--with anguish,\nand absently.  This time--and the following night--the wives fidgeted\nfeebly, and tried to say something.  But didn't.\n\nAnd the night after that they found their tongues and\nresponded--longingly:\n\n\"Oh, if we _could_ only guess!\"\n\nHalliday's comments grew daily more and more sparklingly disagreeable and\ndisparaging.  He went diligently about, laughing at the town,\nindividually and in mass.  But his laugh was the only one left in the\nvillage: it fell upon a hollow and mournful vacancy and emptiness.  Not\neven a smile was findable anywhere.  Halliday carried a cigar-box around\non a tripod, playing that it was a camera, and halted all passers and\naimed the thing and said \"Ready!--now look pleasant, please,\" but not\r\neven this capital joke could surprise the dreary faces into any\nsoftening.\n\nSo three weeks passed--one week was left.  It was Saturday evening after\nsupper.  Instead of the aforetime Saturday-evening flutter and bustle and\nshopping and larking, the streets were empty and desolate.  Richards and\nhis old wife sat apart in their little parlour--miserable and thinking.\r\nThis was become their evening habit now: the life-long habit which had\npreceded it, of reading, knitting, and contented chat, or receiving or\npaying neighbourly calls, was dead and gone and forgotten, ages ago--two\nor three weeks ago; nobody talked now, nobody read, nobody visited--the\nwhole village sat at home, sighing, worrying, silent.  Trying to guess\nout that remark.\n\nThe postman left a letter.  Richards glanced listlessly at the\r\nsuperscription and the post-mark--unfamiliar, both--and tossed the letter\non the table and resumed his might-have-beens and his hopeless dull\nmiseries where he had left them off.  Two or three hours later his wife\ngot wearily up and was going away to bed without a good-night--custom\nnow--but she stopped near the letter and eyed it awhile with a dead\ninterest, then broke it open, and began to skim it over.  Richards,\nsitting there with his chair tilted back against the wall and his chin\nbetween his knees, heard something fall.  It was his wife.  He sprang to\nher side, but she cried out:\n\n\"Leave me alone, I am too happy.  Read the letter--read it!\"\n\nHe did.  He devoured it, his brain reeling.  The letter was from a\ndistant State, and it said: \"I am a stranger to you, but no matter: I have something to tell.  I\n","\"I am a stranger to you, but no matter: I have something to tell.  I\n   have just arrived home from Mexico, and learned about that episode.  Of\n   course you do not know who made that remark, but I know, and I am the\n   only person living who does know.  It was GOODSON.  I knew him well,\n   many years ago.  I passed through your village that very night, and\n   was his guest till the midnight train came along.  I overheard him\n   make that remark to the stranger in the dark--it was in Hale Alley.  He\n   and I talked of it the rest of the way home, and while smoking in his\n   house.  He mentioned many of your villagers in the course of his\n   talk--most of them in a very uncomplimentary way, but two or three\n   favourably: among these latter yourself.  I say 'favourably'--nothing\r\nstronger.  I remember his saying he did not actually LIKE any person\n   in the town--not one; but that you--I THINK he said you--am almost\n   sure--had done him a very great service once, possibly without knowing\n   the full value of it, and he wished he had a fortune, he would leave\n   it to you when he died, and a curse apiece for the rest of the\n   citizens.  Now, then, if it was you that did him that service, you are\n   his legitimate heir, and entitled to the sack of gold.  I know that I\n   can trust to your honour and honesty, for in a citizen of Hadleyburg\n   these virtues are an unfailing inheritance, and so I am going to\n   reveal to you the remark, well satisfied that if you are not the right\n   man you will seek and find the right one and see that poor Goodson's\r\ndebt of gratitude for the service referred to is paid.  This is the\n   remark 'YOU ARE FAR FROM BEING A BAD MAN: GO, AND REFORM.'\n\n   \"HOWARD L. STEPHENSON.\"\n\n\"Oh, Edward, the money is ours, and I am so grateful, _oh_, so\ngrateful,--kiss me, dear, it's for ever since we kissed--and we needed it\nso--the money--and now you are free of Pinkerton and his bank, and\nnobody's slave any more; it seems to me I could fly for joy.\" It was a happy half-hour that the couple spent there on the settee\n","It was a happy half-hour that the couple spent there on the settee\ncaressing each other; it was the old days come again--days that had begun\nwith their courtship and lasted without a break till the stranger brought\nthe deadly money.  By-and-by the wife said:\n\n\"Oh, Edward, how lucky it was you did him that grand service, poor\nGoodson!  I never liked him, but I love him now.  And it was fine and\r\nbeautiful of you never to mention it or brag about it.\"  Then, with a\ntouch of reproach, \"But you ought to have told _me_, Edward, you ought to\nhave told your wife, you know.\"\n\n\"Well, I--er--well, Mary, you see--\"\n\n\"Now stop hemming and hawing, and tell me about it, Edward.  I always\nloved you, and now I'm proud of you.  Everybody believes there was only\none good generous soul in this village, and now it turns out that\r\nyou--Edward, why don't you tell me?\"\n\n\"Well--er--er--Why, Mary, I can't!\"\n\n\"You _can't_?  _Why_ can't you?\"\n\n\"You see, he--well, he--he made me promise I wouldn't.\"\n\nThe wife looked him over, and said, very slowly:\n\n\"Made--you--promise?  Edward, what do you tell me that for?\"\n\n\"Mary, do you think I would lie?\"\n\nShe was troubled and silent for a moment, then she laid her hand within\r\nhis and said:\n\n\"No . . . no.  We have wandered far enough from our bearings--God spare\nus that!  In all your life you have never uttered a lie.  But now--now\nthat the foundations of things seem to be crumbling from under us,\nwe--we--\"  She lost her voice for a moment, then said, brokenly, \"Lead us\nnot into temptation. . . I think you made the promise, Edward.  Let it\nrest so.  Let us keep away from that ground.  Now--that is all gone by;\nlet us he happy again; it is no time for clouds.\"\n\nEdward found it something of an effort to comply, for his mind kept\nwandering--trying to remember what the service was that he had done\nGoodson.\n\nThe couple lay awake the most of the night, Mary happy and busy, Edward\nbusy, but not so happy.  Mary was planning what she would do with the money.  Edward was trying to recall that service.  At first his\n","money.  Edward was trying to recall that service.  At first his\nconscience was sore on account of the lie he had told Mary--if it was a\nlie.  After much reflection--suppose it _was_ a lie?  What then?  Was it\nsuch a great matter?  Aren't we always _acting_ lies?  Then why not tell\nthem?  Look at Mary--look what she had done.  While he was hurrying off\non his honest errand, what was she doing?  Lamenting because the papers\nhadn't been destroyed and the money kept.  Is theft better than lying?\n\n_That_ point lost its sting--the lie dropped into the background and left\ncomfort behind it.  The next point came to the front: _had_ he rendered\nthat service?  Well, here was Goodson's own evidence as reported in\nStephenson's letter; there could be no better evidence than that--it was\r\neven _proof_ that he had rendered it.  Of course.  So that point was\nsettled. . . No, not quite.  He recalled with a wince that this unknown\nMr. Stephenson was just a trifle unsure as to whether the performer of it\nwas Richards or some other--and, oh dear, he had put Richards on his\nhonour!  He must himself decide whither that money must go--and Mr.\nStephenson was not doubting that if he was the wrong man he would go\r\nhonourably and find the right one.  Oh, it was odious to put a man in\nsuch a situation--ah, why couldn't Stephenson have left out that doubt?\nWhat did he want to intrude that for?\n\nFurther reflection.  How did it happen that _Richards's_ name remained in\nStephenson's mind as indicating the right man, and not some other man's\nname?  That looked good.  Yes, that looked very good.  In fact it went on\r\nlooking better and better, straight along--until by-and-by it grew into\npositive _proof_.  And then Richards put the matter at once out of his\nmind, for he had a private instinct that a proof once established is\nbetter left so.\n\nHe was feeling reasonably comfortable now, but there was still one other\ndetail that kept pushing itself on his notice: of course he had done that\nservice--that was settled; but what _was_ that service?  He must recall\nit--he would not go to sleep till he had recalled it; it would make his\npeace of mind perfect.  And so he thought and thought.  He thought of a\ndozen things--possible services, even probable services--but none of them\nseemed adequate, none of them seemed large enough, none of them seemed worth the money--worth the fortune Goodson had wished he could leave in\n","worth the money--worth the fortune Goodson had wished he could leave in\nhis will.  And besides, he couldn't remember having done them, anyway.\nNow, then--now, then--what _kind_ of a service would it be that would\nmake a man so inordinately grateful?  Ah--the saving of his soul!  That\nmust be it.  Yes, he could remember, now, how he once set himself the\ntask of converting Goodson, and laboured at it as much as--he was going\nto say three months; but upon closer examination it shrunk to a month,\nthen to a week, then to a day, then to nothing.  Yes, he remembered now,\nand with unwelcome vividness, that Goodson had told him to go to thunder\nand mind his own business--_he_ wasn't hankering to follow Hadleyburg to\nheaven!\n\nSo that solution was a failure--he hadn't saved Goodson's soul.  Richards\r\nwas discouraged.  Then after a little came another idea: had he saved\nGoodson's property?  No, that wouldn't do--he hadn't any.  His life?  That\nis it!  Of course.  Why, he might have thought of it before.  This time\nhe was on the right track, sure.  His imagination-mill was hard at work\nin a minute, now.\n\nThereafter, during a stretch of two exhausting hours, he was busy saving\r\nGoodson's life.  He saved it in all kinds of difficult and perilous ways.\nIn every case he got it saved satisfactorily up to a certain point; then,\njust as he was beginning to get well persuaded that it had really\nhappened, a troublesome detail would turn up which made the whole thing\nimpossible.  As in the matter of drowning, for instance.  In that case he\nhad swum out and tugged Goodson ashore in an unconscious state with a\r\ngreat crowd looking on and applauding, but when he had got it all thought\nout and was just beginning to remember all about it, a whole swarm of\ndisqualifying details arrived on the ground: the town would have known of\nthe circumstance, Mary would have known of it, it would glare like a\nlimelight in his own memory instead of being an inconspicuous service\nwhich he had possibly rendered \"without knowing its full value.\"  And at\nthis point he remembered that he couldn't swim anyway.\n\nAh--_there_ was a point which he had been overlooking from the start: it\nhad to be a service which he had rendered \"possibly without knowing the\nfull value of it.\"  Why, really, that ought to be an easy hunt--much\neasier than those others.  And sure enough, by-and-by he found it. Goodson, years and years ago, came near marrying a very sweet and pretty\n","Goodson, years and years ago, came near marrying a very sweet and pretty\ngirl, named Nancy Hewitt, but in some way or other the match had been\nbroken off; the girl died, Goodson remained a bachelor, and by-and-by\nbecame a soured one and a frank despiser of the human species.  Soon\nafter the girl's death the village found out, or thought it had found\nout, that she carried a spoonful of negro blood in her veins.  Richards\nworked at these details a good while, and in the end he thought he\nremembered things concerning them which must have gotten mislaid in his\nmemory through long neglect.  He seemed to dimly remember that it was\n_he_ that found out about the negro blood; that it was he that told the\nvillage; that the village told Goodson where they got it; that he thus\r\nsaved Goodson from marrying the tainted girl; that he had done him this\ngreat service \"without knowing the full value of it,\" in fact without\nknowing that he _was_ doing it; but that Goodson knew the value of it,\nand what a narrow escape he had had, and so went to his grave grateful to\nhis benefactor and wishing he had a fortune to leave him.  It was all\nclear and simple, now, and the more he went over it the more luminous and\ncertain it grew; and at last, when he nestled to sleep, satisfied and\nhappy, he remembered the whole thing just as if it had been yesterday.  In\nfact, he dimly remembered Goodson's _telling_ him his gratitude once.\nMeantime Mary had spent six thousand dollars on a new house for herself\nand a pair of slippers for her pastor, and then had fallen peacefully to\nrest.\r\nThat same Saturday evening the postman had delivered a letter to each of\nthe other principal citizens--nineteen letters in all.  No two of the\nenvelopes were alike, and no two of the superscriptions were in the same\nhand, but the letters inside were just like each other in every detail\nbut one.  They were exact copies of the letter received by\nRichards--handwriting and all--and were all signed by Stephenson, but in\nplace of Richards's name each receiver's own name appeared.\n\nAll night long eighteen principal citizens did what their caste-brother\nRichards was doing at the same time--they put in their energies trying to\nremember what notable service it was that they had unconsciously done\nBarclay Goodson.  In no case was it a holiday job; still they succeeded. And while they were at this work, which was difficult, their wives put in\n","And while they were at this work, which was difficult, their wives put in\nthe night spending the money, which was easy.  During that one night the\nnineteen wives spent an average of seven thousand dollars each out of the\nforty thousand in the sack--a hundred and thirty-three thousand\naltogether.\n\nNext day there was a surprise for Jack Halliday.  He noticed that the\nfaces of the nineteen chief citizens and their wives bore that expression\nof peaceful and holy happiness again.  He could not understand it,\nneither was he able to invent any remarks about it that could damage it\nor disturb it.  And so it was his turn to be dissatisfied with life.  His\nprivate guesses at the reasons for the happiness failed in all instances,\nupon examination.  When he met Mrs. Wilcox and noticed the placid ecstasy\r\nin her face, he said to himself, \"Her cat has had kittens\"--and went and\nasked the cook; it was not so, the cook had detected the happiness, but\ndid not know the cause.  When Halliday found the duplicate ecstasy in the\nface of \"Shadbelly\" Billson (village nickname), he was sure some\nneighbour of Billson's had broken his leg, but inquiry showed that this\nhad not happened.  The subdued ecstasy in Gregory Yates's face could mean\nbut one thing--he was a mother-in-law short; it was another mistake.  \"And\nPinkerton--Pinkerton--he has collected ten cents that he thought he was\ngoing to lose.\"  And so on, and so on.  In some cases the guesses had to\nremain in doubt, in the others they proved distinct errors.  In the end\nHalliday said to himself, \"Anyway it roots up that there's nineteen\r\nHadleyburg families temporarily in heaven: I don't know how it happened;\nI only know Providence is off duty to-day.\"\n\nAn architect and builder from the next State had lately ventured to set\nup a small business in this unpromising village, and his sign had now\nbeen hanging out a week.  Not a customer yet; he was a discouraged man,\nand sorry he had come.  But his weather changed suddenly now.  First one\nand then another chief citizen's wife said to him privately:\n\n\"Come to my house Monday week--but say nothing about it for the present.\nWe think of building.\"\n\nHe got eleven invitations that day.  That night he wrote his daughter and\nbroke off her match with her student.  He said she could marry a mile\nhigher than that.\n\nPinkerton the banker and two or three other well-to-do men planned country-seats--but waited.  That kind don't count their chickens until\n","country-seats--but waited.  That kind don't count their chickens until\nthey are hatched.\n\nThe Wilsons devised a grand new thing--a fancy-dress ball.  They made no\nactual promises, but told all their acquaintanceship in confidence that\nthey were thinking the matter over and thought they should give it--\"and\nif we do, you will be invited, of course.\"  People were surprised, and\nsaid, one to another, \"Why, they are crazy, those poor Wilsons, they\ncan't afford it.\"  Several among the nineteen said privately to their\nhusbands, \"It is a good idea, we will keep still till their cheap thing\nis over, then _we_ will give one that will make it sick.\"\n\nThe days drifted along, and the bill of future squanderings rose higher\nand higher, wilder and wilder, more and more foolish and reckless.  It\r\nbegan to look as if every member of the nineteen would not only spend his\nwhole forty thousand dollars before receiving-day, but be actually in\ndebt by the time he got the money.  In some cases light-headed people did\nnot stop with planning to spend, they really spent--on credit.  They\nbought land, mortgages, farms, speculative stocks, fine clothes, horses,\nand various other things, paid down the bonus, and made themselves liable\nfor the rest--at ten days.  Presently the sober second thought came, and\nHalliday noticed that a ghastly anxiety was beginning to show up in a\ngood many faces.  Again he was puzzled, and didn't know what to make of\nit.  \"The Wilcox kittens aren't dead, for they weren't born; nobody's\nbroken a leg; there's no shrinkage in mother-in-laws; _nothing_ has\r\nhappened--it is an insolvable mystery.\"\n\nThere was another puzzled man, too--the Rev. Mr. Burgess.  For days,\nwherever he went, people seemed to follow him or to be watching out for\nhim; and if he ever found himself in a retired spot, a member of the\nnineteen would be sure to appear, thrust an envelope privately into his\nhand, whisper \"To be opened at the town-hall Friday evening,\" then vanish away like a guilty thing.  He was expecting that there might be one\n","away like a guilty thing.  He was expecting that there might be one\nclaimant for the sack--doubtful, however, Goodson being dead--but it\nnever occurred to him that all this crowd might be claimants.  When the\ngreat Friday came at last, he found that he had nineteen envelopes.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThe town-hall had never looked finer.  The platform at the end of it was\nbacked by a showy draping of flags; at intervals along the walls were\r\nfestoons of flags; the gallery fronts were clothed in flags; the\nsupporting columns were swathed in flags; all this was to impress the\nstranger, for he would be there in considerable force, and in a large\ndegree he would be connected with the press.  The house was full.  The\n412 fixed seats were occupied; also the 68 extra chairs which had been\npacked into the aisles; the steps of the platform were occupied; some\ndistinguished strangers were given seats on the platform; at the\nhorseshoe of tables which fenced the front and sides of the platform sat\na strong force of special correspondents who had come from everywhere.  It\nwas the best-dressed house the town had ever produced.  There were some\ntolerably expensive toilets there, and in several cases the ladies who\r\nwore them had the look of being unfamiliar with that kind of clothes.  At\nleast the town thought they had that look, but the notion could have\narisen from the town's knowledge of the fact that these ladies had never\ninhabited such clothes before.\n\nThe gold-sack stood on a little table at the front of the platform where\nall the house could see it.  The bulk of the house gazed at it with a\r\nburning interest, a mouth-watering interest, a wistful and pathetic\ninterest; a minority of nineteen couples gazed at it tenderly, lovingly,\nproprietarily, and the male half of this minority kept saying over to\nthemselves the moving little impromptu speeches of thankfulness for the\naudience's applause and congratulations which they were presently going\nto get up and deliver.  Every now and then one of these got a piece of paper out of his vest pocket and privately glanced at it to refresh his\nmemory.\n","paper out of his vest pocket and privately glanced at it to refresh his\nmemory.\n\nOf course there was a buzz of conversation going on--there always is; but\nat last, when the Rev. Mr. Burgess rose and laid his hand on the sack, he\ncould hear his microbes gnaw, the place was so still.  He related the\ncurious history of the sack, then went on to speak in warm terms of\nHadleyburg's old and well-earned reputation for spotless honesty, and of\nthe town's just pride in this reputation.  He said that this reputation\nwas a treasure of priceless value; that under Providence its value had\nnow become inestimably enhanced, for the recent episode had spread this\nfame far and wide, and thus had focussed the eyes of the American world\nupon this village, and made its name for all time, as he hoped and\r\nbelieved, a synonym for commercial incorruptibility.  [Applause.]  \"And\nwho is to be the guardian of this noble fame--the community as a whole?\nNo!  The responsibility is individual, not communal.  From this day forth\neach and every one of you is in his own person its special guardian, and\nindividually responsible that no harm shall come to it.  Do you--does\neach of you--accept this great trust?  [Tumultuous assent.]  Then all is\nwell.  Transmit it to your children and to your children's children.  To-\nday your purity is beyond reproach--see to it that it shall remain so.  To-\nday there is not a person in your community who could be beguiled to\ntouch a penny not his own--see to it that you abide in this grace.  [\"We\nwill! we will!\"]  This is not the place to make comparisons between\r\nourselves and other communities--some of them ungracious towards us; they\nhave their ways, we have ours; let us be content.  [Applause.]  I am\ndone.  Under my hand, my friends, rests a stranger's eloquent recognition\nof what we are; through him the world will always henceforth know what we\nare.  We do not know who he is, but in your name I utter your gratitude,\nand ask you to raise your voices in indorsement.\"\n\nThe house rose in a body and made the walls quake with the thunders of\nits thankfulness for the space of a long minute.  Then it sat down, and\nMr. Burgess took an envelope out of his pocket.  The house held its\nbreath while he slit the envelope open and took from it a slip of paper.\nHe read its contents--slowly and impressively--the audience listening with tranced attention to this magic document, each of whose words stood\n","with tranced attention to this magic document, each of whose words stood\nfor an ingot of gold:\n\n\"'The remark which I made to the distressed stranger was this: \"You are\nvery far from being a bad man; go, and reform.\"'\"  Then he continued:--\"We\nshall know in a moment now whether the remark here quoted corresponds\nwith the one concealed in the sack; and if that shall prove to be so--and\r\nit undoubtedly will--this sack of gold belongs to a fellow-citizen who\nwill henceforth stand before the nation as the symbol of the special\nvirtue which has made our town famous throughout the land--Mr. Billson!\"\n\nThe house had gotten itself all ready to burst into the proper tornado of\napplause; but instead of doing it, it seemed stricken with a paralysis;\nthere was a deep hush for a moment or two, then a wave of whispered\r\nmurmurs swept the place--of about this tenor: \"_Billson_! oh, come, this\nis _too_ thin!  Twenty dollars to a stranger--or _anybody_--_Billson_!\nTell it to the marines!\"  And now at this point the house caught its\nbreath all of a sudden in a new access of astonishment, for it discovered\nthat whereas in one part of the hall Deacon Billson was standing up with\nhis head weekly bowed, in another part of it Lawyer Wilson was doing the\nsame.  There was a wondering silence now for a while.  Everybody was\npuzzled, and nineteen couples were surprised and indignant.\n\nBillson and Wilson turned and stared at each other.  Billson asked,\nbitingly:\n\n\"Why do _you_ rise, Mr. Wilson?\"\n\n\"Because I have a right to.  Perhaps you will be good enough to explain\nto the house why _you_ rise.\"\r\n\"With great pleasure.  Because I wrote that paper.\"\n\n\"It is an impudent falsity!  I wrote it myself.\"\n\nIt was Burgess's turn to be paralysed.  He stood looking vacantly at\nfirst one of the men and then the other, and did not seem to know what to\ndo.  The house was stupefied.  Lawyer Wilson spoke up now, and said:\n\n\"I ask the Chair to read the name signed to that paper.\"\n\nThat brought the Chair to itself, and it read out the name: \"John Wharton _Billson_.\"\n","\"John Wharton _Billson_.\"\n\n\"There!\" shouted Billson, \"what have you got to say for yourself now?  And\nwhat kind of apology are you going to make to me and to this insulted\nhouse for the imposture which you have attempted to play here?\"\n\n\"No apologies are due, sir; and as for the rest of it, I publicly charge\nyou with pilfering my note from Mr. Burgess and substituting a copy of it\r\nsigned with your own name.  There is no other way by which you could have\ngotten hold of the test-remark; I alone, of living men, possessed the\nsecret of its wording.\"\n\nThere was likely to be a scandalous state of things if this went on;\neverybody noticed with distress that the shorthand scribes were\nscribbling like mad; many people were crying \"Chair, chair!  Order!\norder!\"  Burgess rapped with his gavel, and said:\n\n\"Let us not forget the proprieties due.  There has evidently been a\nmistake somewhere, but surely that is all.  If Mr. Wilson gave me an\nenvelope--and I remember now that he did--I still have it.\"\n\nHe took one out of his pocket, opened it, glanced at it, looked surprised\nand worried, and stood silent a few moments.  Then he waved his hand in a\r\nwandering and mechanical way, and made an effort or two to say something,\nthen gave it up, despondently.  Several voices cried out:\n\n\"Read it! read it!  What is it?\"\n\nSo he began, in a dazed and sleep-walker fashion:\n\n\"'The remark which I made to the unhappy stranger was this: \"You are far\nfrom being a bad man.  [The house gazed at him marvelling.]  Go, and\nreform.\"'  [Murmurs: \"Amazing! what can this mean?\"]  This one,\" said the\nChair, \"is signed Thurlow G. Wilson.\"\n\n\"There!\" cried Wilson, \"I reckon that settles it!  I knew perfectly well\nmy note was purloined.\"\n\n\"Purloined!\" retorted Billson.  \"I'll let you know that neither you nor\nany man of your kidney must venture to--\"\n\nThe Chair: \"Order, gentlemen, order!  Take your seats, both of you,\nplease.\" They obeyed, shaking their heads and grumbling angrily.  The house was\n","They obeyed, shaking their heads and grumbling angrily.  The house was\nprofoundly puzzled; it did not know what to do with this curious\nemergency.  Presently Thompson got up.  Thompson was the hatter.  He\nwould have liked to be a Nineteener; but such was not for him; his stock\nof hats was not considerable enough for the position.  He said:\n\n\"Mr. Chairman, if I may be permitted to make a suggestion, can both of\nthese gentlemen be right?  I put it to you, sir, can both have happened\nto say the very same words to the stranger?  It seems to me--\"\n\nThe tanner got up and interrupted him.  The tanner was a disgruntled man;\nhe believed himself entitled to be a Nineteener, but he couldn't get\nrecognition.  It made him a little unpleasant in his ways and speech.\nSaid he:\r\n\"Sho, _that's_ not the point!  _That_ could happen--twice in a hundred\nyears--but not the other thing.  _Neither_ of them gave the twenty\ndollars!\"  [A ripple of applause.]\n\nBillson.  \"I did!\"\n\nWilson.  \"I did!\"\n\nThen each accused the other of pilfering.\n\nThe Chair.  \"Order!  Sit down, if you please--both of you.  Neither of\nthe notes has been out of my possession at any moment.\"\n\nA Voice.  \"Good--that settles _that_!\"\n\nThe Tanner.  \"Mr. Chairman, one thing is now plain: one of these men has\nbeen eavesdropping under the other one's bed, and filching family\nsecrets.  If it is not unparliamentary to suggest it, I will remark that\nboth are equal to it.  [The Chair.  \"Order! order!\"]  I withdraw the\nremark, sir, and will confine myself to suggesting that _if_ one of them\r\nhas overheard the other reveal the test-remark to his wife, we shall\ncatch him now.\"\n\nA Voice.  \"How?\"\n\nThe Tanner.  \"Easily.  The two have not quoted the remark in exactly the\nsame words.  You would have noticed that, if there hadn't been a\nconsiderable stretch of time and an exciting quarrel inserted between the\ntwo readings.\"\n\nA Voice.  \"Name the difference.\"\n\nThe Tanner.  \"The word _very_ is in Billson's note, and not in the\r\nother.\"\n\nMany Voices.  \"That's so--he's right!\"\n\nThe Tanner.  \"And so, if the Chair will examine the test-remark in the\nsack, we shall know which of these two frauds--[The Chair.\n\"Order!\"]--which of these two adventurers--[The Chair.  \"Order!\norder!\"]--which of these two gentlemen--[laughter and applause]--is\nentitled to wear the belt as being the first dishonest blatherskite ever bred in this town--which he has dishonoured, and which will be a sultry\n","bred in this town--which he has dishonoured, and which will be a sultry\nplace for him from now out!\"  [Vigorous applause.]\n\nMany Voices.  \"Open it!--open the sack!\"\n\nMr. Burgess made a slit in the sack, slid his hand in, and brought out an\nenvelope.  In it were a couple of folded notes.  He said:\n\n\"One of these is marked, 'Not to be examined until all written\ncommunications which have been addressed to the Chair--if any--shall have\r\nbeen read.'  The other is marked '_The Test_.'  Allow me.  It is\nworded--to wit:\n\n\"'I do not require that the first half of the remark which was made to me\nby my benefactor shall be quoted with exactness, for it was not striking,\nand could be forgotten; but its closing fifteen words are quite striking,\nand I think easily rememberable; unless _these_ shall be accurately\r\nreproduced, let the applicant be regarded as an impostor.  My benefactor\nbegan by saying he seldom gave advice to anyone, but that it always bore\nthe hall-mark of high value when he did give it.  Then he said this--and\nit has never faded from my memory: '_You are far from being a bad\nman_--''\"\n\nFifty Voices.  \"That settles it--the money's Wilson's!  Wilson!  Wilson!\nSpeech!  Speech!\"\n\nPeople jumped up and crowded around Wilson, wringing his hand and\ncongratulating fervently--meantime the Chair was hammering with the gavel\nand shouting:\n\n\"Order, gentlemen!  Order!  Order!  Let me finish reading, please.\"  When\nquiet was restored, the reading was resumed--as follows:\n\n\"'_Go, and reform--or, mark my words--some day, for your sins you will\r\ndie and go to hell or Hadleyburg_--TRY AND MAKE IT THE FORMER.'\"\n\nA ghastly silence followed.  First an angry cloud began to settle darkly\nupon the faces of the citizenship; after a pause the cloud began to rise,\nand a tickled expression tried to take its place; tried so hard that it\nwas only kept under with great and painful difficulty; the reporters, the\nBrixtonites, and other strangers bent their heads down and shielded their\nfaces with their hands, and managed to hold in by main strength and\nheroic courtesy.  At this most inopportune time burst upon the stillness\nthe roar of a solitary voice--Jack Halliday's:\n\n\"_That's_ got the hall-mark on it!\"\n\nThen the house let go, strangers and all.  Even Mr. Burgess's gravity\nbroke down presently, then the audience considered itself officially absolved from all restraint, and it made the most of its privilege.  It\n","absolved from all restraint, and it made the most of its privilege.  It\nwas a good long laugh, and a tempestuously wholehearted one, but it\nceased at last--long enough for Mr. Burgess to try to resume, and for the\npeople to get their eyes partially wiped; then it broke out again, and\nafterward yet again; then at last Burgess was able to get out these\nserious words:\n\n\"It is useless to try to disguise the fact--we find ourselves in the\npresence of a matter of grave import.  It involves the honour of your\ntown--it strikes at the town's good name.  The difference of a single\nword between the test-remarks offered by Mr. Wilson and Mr. Billson was\nitself a serious thing, since it indicated that one or the other of these\ngentlemen had committed a theft--\"\r\nThe two men were sitting limp, nerveless, crushed; but at these words\nboth were electrified into movement, and started to get up.\n\n\"Sit down!\" said the Chair, sharply, and they obeyed.  \"That, as I have\nsaid, was a serious thing.  And it was--but for only one of them.  But\nthe matter has become graver; for the honour of _both_ is now in\nformidable peril.  Shall I go even further, and say in inextricable\nperil?  _Both_ left out the crucial fifteen words.\"  He paused.  During\nseveral moments he allowed the pervading stillness to gather and deepen\nits impressive effects, then added: \"There would seem to be but one way\nwhereby this could happen.  I ask these gentlemen--Was there\n_collusion_?--_agreement_?\"\n\nA low murmur sifted through the house; its import was, \"He's got them\nboth.\"\r\nBillson was not used to emergencies; he sat in a helpless collapse.  But\nWilson was a lawyer.  He struggled to his feet, pale and worried, and\nsaid:\n\n\"I ask the indulgence of the house while I explain this most painful\nmatter.  I am sorry to say what I am about to say, since it must inflict\nirreparable injury upon Mr. Billson, whom I have always esteemed and\nrespected until now, and in whose invulnerability to temptation I\nentirely believed--as did you all.  But for the preservation of my own\nhonour I must speak--and with frankness.  I confess with shame--and I now\nbeseech your pardon for it--that I said to the ruined stranger all of the\nwords contained in the test-remark, including the disparaging fifteen.\n[Sensation.]  When the late publication was made I recalled them, and I resolved to claim the sack of coin, for by every right I was entitled to\n","resolved to claim the sack of coin, for by every right I was entitled to\nit.  Now I will ask you to consider this point, and weigh it well; that\nstranger's gratitude to me that night knew no bounds; he said himself\nthat he could find no words for it that were adequate, and that if he\nshould ever be able he would repay me a thousandfold.  Now, then, I ask\nyou this; could I expect--could I believe--could I even remotely\nimagine--that, feeling as he did, he would do so ungrateful a thing as to\nadd those quite unnecessary fifteen words to his test?--set a trap for\nme?--expose me as a slanderer of my own town before my own people\nassembled in a public hall?  It was preposterous; it was impossible.  His\ntest would contain only the kindly opening clause of my remark.  Of that\r\nI had no shadow of doubt.  You would have thought as I did.  You would\nnot have expected a base betrayal from one whom you had befriended and\nagainst whom you had committed no offence.  And so with perfect\nconfidence, perfect trust, I wrote on a piece of paper the opening\nwords--ending with \"Go, and reform,\"--and signed it.  When I was about to\nput it in an envelope I was called into my back office, and without\r\nthinking I left the paper lying open on my desk.\"  He stopped, turned his\nhead slowly toward Billson, waited a moment, then added: \"I ask you to\nnote this; when I returned, a little latter, Mr. Billson was retiring by\nmy street door.\"  [Sensation.]\n\nIn a moment Billson was on his feet and shouting:\n\n\"It's a lie!  It's an infamous lie!\"\n\nThe Chair.  \"Be seated, sir!  Mr. Wilson has the floor.\"\r\nBillson's friends pulled him into his seat and quieted him, and Wilson\nwent on:\n\n\"Those are the simple facts.  My note was now lying in a different place\non the table from where I had left it.  I noticed that, but attached no\nimportance to it, thinking a draught had blown it there.  That Mr.\nBillson would read a private paper was a thing which could not occur to\nme; he was an honourable man, and he would be above that.  If you will allow me to say it, I think his extra word '_very_' stands explained: it\n","allow me to say it, I think his extra word '_very_' stands explained: it\nis attributable to a defect of memory.  I was the only man in the world\nwho could furnish here any detail of the test-mark--by _honourable_\nmeans.  I have finished.\"\n\nThere is nothing in the world like a persuasive speech to fuddle the\nmental apparatus and upset the convictions and debauch the emotions of an\r\naudience not practised in the tricks and delusions of oratory.  Wilson\nsat down victorious.  The house submerged him in tides of approving\napplause; friends swarmed to him and shook him by the hand and\ncongratulated him, and Billson was shouted down and not allowed to say a\nword.  The Chair hammered and hammered with its gavel, and kept shouting:\n\n\"But let us proceed, gentlemen, let us proceed!\"\n\nAt last there was a measurable degree of quiet, and the hatter said:\n\n\"But what is there to proceed with, sir, but to deliver the money?\"\n\nVoices.  \"That's it!  That's it!  Come forward, Wilson!\"\n\nThe Hatter.  \"I move three cheers for Mr. Wilson, Symbol of the special\nvirtue which--\"\n\nThe cheers burst forth before he could finish; and in the midst of\r\nthem--and in the midst of the clamour of the gavel also--some enthusiasts\nmounted Wilson on a big friend's shoulder and were going to fetch him in\ntriumph to the platform.  The Chair's voice now rose above the noise:\n\n\"Order!  To your places!  You forget that there is still a document to be\nread.\"  When quiet had been restored he took up the document, and was\ngoing to read it, but laid it down again saying \"I forgot; this is not to\nbe read until all written communications received by me have first been\nread.\"  He took an envelope out of his pocket, removed its enclosure,\nglanced at it--seemed astonished--held it out and gazed at it--stared at\nit.\n\nTwenty or thirty voices cried out\n\n\"What is it?  Read it! read it!\"\n\nAnd he did--slowly, and wondering:\r\n\"'The remark which I made to the stranger--[Voices.  \"Hello! how's\nthis?\"]--was this: 'You are far from being a bad man.  [Voices.  \"Great\nScott!\"]  Go, and reform.'\"  [Voice.  \"Oh, saw my leg off!\"]  Signed by\nMr. Pinkerton the banker.\"\n\nThe pandemonium of delight which turned itself loose now was of a sort to\nmake the judicious weep.  Those whose withers were unwrung laughed till the tears ran down; the reporters, in throes of laughter, set down\n","the tears ran down; the reporters, in throes of laughter, set down\ndisordered pot-hooks which would never in the world be decipherable; and\na sleeping dog jumped up scared out of its wits, and barked itself crazy\nat the turmoil.  All manner of cries were scattered through the din:\n\"We're getting rich--_two_ Symbols of Incorruptibility!--without counting\nBillson!\"  \"_Three_!--count Shadbelly in--we can't have too many!\"  \"All\r\nright--Billson's elected!\"  \"Alas, poor Wilson! victim of _two_ thieves!\"\n\nA Powerful Voice.  \"Silence!  The Chair's fished up something more out of\nits pocket.\"\n\nVoices.  \"Hurrah!  Is it something fresh?  Read it! read! read!\"\n\nThe Chair [reading].  \"'The remark which I made,' etc.  'You are far from\nbeing a bad man.  Go,' etc.  Signed, 'Gregory Yates.'\"\n\nTornado of Voices.  \"Four Symbols!\"  \"'Rah for Yates!\"  \"Fish again!\"\r\nThe house was in a roaring humour now, and ready to get all the fun out\nof the occasion that might be in it.  Several Nineteeners, looking pale\nand distressed, got up and began to work their way towards the aisles,\nbut a score of shouts went up:\n\n\"The doors, the doors--close the doors; no Incorruptible shall leave this\nplace!  Sit down, everybody!\"  The mandate was obeyed.\r\n\"Fish again!  Read! read!\"\n\nThe Chair fished again, and once more the familiar words began to fall\nfrom its lips--\"'You are far from being a bad man--'\"\n\n\"Name! name!  What's his name?\"\n\n\"'L. Ingoldsby Sargent.'\"\n\n\"Five elected!  Pile up the Symbols!  Go on, go on!\"\n\n\"'You are far from being a bad--'\"\n\n\"Name! name!\"\n\n\"'Nicholas Whitworth.'\"\n\n\"Hooray! hooray! it's a symbolical day!\"\n\nSomebody wailed in, and began to sing this rhyme (leaving out \"it's\") to\nthe lovely \"Mikado\" tune of \"When a man's afraid of a beautiful maid;\"\nthe audience joined in, with joy; then, just in time, somebody\ncontributed another line--\n\n   \"And don't you this forget--\"\n\nThe house roared it out.  A third line was at once furnished--\n\n   \"Corruptibles far from Hadleyburg are--\"\r\nThe house roared that one too.  As the last note died, Jack Halliday's\nvoice rose high and clear, freighted with a final line--\n\n   \"But the Symbols are here, you bet!\"\n\nThat was sung, with booming enthusiasm.  Then the happy house started in\nat the beginning and sang the four lines through twice, with immense\nswing and dash, and finished up with a crashing three-times-three and a tiger for \"Hadleyburg the Incorruptible and all Symbols of it which we\n","tiger for \"Hadleyburg the Incorruptible and all Symbols of it which we\nshall find worthy to receive the hall-mark to-night.\"\n\nThen the shoutings at the Chair began again, all over the place:\n\n\"Go on! go on!  Read! read some more!  Read all you've got!\"\n\n\"That's it--go on!  We are winning eternal celebrity!\"\n\nA dozen men got up now and began to protest.  They said that this farce\nwas the work of some abandoned joker, and was an insult to the whole\r\ncommunity.  Without a doubt these signatures were all forgeries--\n\n\"Sit down! sit down!  Shut up!  You are confessing.  We'll find your\nnames in the lot.\"\n\n\"Mr. Chairman, how many of those envelopes have you got?\"\n\nThe Chair counted.\n\n\"Together with those that have been already examined, there are\nnineteen.\"\n\nA storm of derisive applause broke out.\n\n\"Perhaps they all contain the secret.  I move that you open them all and\nread every signature that is attached to a note of that sort--and read\nalso the first eight words of the note.\"\n\n\"Second the motion!\"\n\nIt was put and carried--uproariously.  Then poor old Richards got up, and\nhis wife rose and stood at his side.  Her head was bent down, so that\nnone might see that she was crying.  Her husband gave her his arm, and so\r\nsupporting her, he began to speak in a quavering voice:\n\n\"My friends, you have known us two--Mary and me--all our lives, and I\nthink you have liked us and respected us--\"\n\nThe Chair interrupted him:\n\n\"Allow me.  It is quite true--that which you are saying, Mr. Richards;\nthis town _does_ know you two; it _does_ like you; it _does_ respect you;\nmore--it honours you and _loves_ you--\"\n\nHalliday's voice rang out:\n\n\"That's the hall-marked truth, too!  If the Chair is right, let the house\nspeak up and say it.  Rise!  Now, then--hip! hip! hip!--all together!\"\n\nThe house rose in mass, faced toward the old couple eagerly, filled the\nair with a snow-storm of waving handkerchiefs, and delivered the cheers\nwith all its affectionate heart.\n\nThe Chair then continued: \"What I was going to say is this: We know your good heart, Mr. Richards,\n","\"What I was going to say is this: We know your good heart, Mr. Richards,\nbut this is not a time for the exercise of charity toward offenders.\n[Shouts of \"Right! right!\"]  I see your generous purpose in your face,\nbut I cannot allow you to plead for these men--\"\n\n\"But I was going to--\"\n\n\"Please take your seat, Mr. Richards.  We must examine the rest of these\nnotes--simple fairness to the men who have already been exposed requires\r\nthis.  As soon as that has been done--I give you my word for this--you\nshall he heard.\"\n\nMany voices.  \"Right!--the Chair is right--no interruption can be\npermitted at this stage!  Go on!--the names! the names!--according to the\nterms of the motion!\"\n\nThe old couple sat reluctantly down, and the husband whispered to the\nwife, \"It is pitifully hard to have to wait; the shame will be greater\r\nthan ever when they find we were only going to plead for _ourselves_.\"\n\nStraightway the jollity broke loose again with the reading of the names.\n\n\"'You are far from being a bad man--' Signature, 'Robert J. Titmarsh.'\"\n\n'\"You are far from being a bad man--' Signature, 'Eliphalet Weeks.'\"\n\n\"'You are far from being a bad man--' Signature, 'Oscar B. Wilder.'\"\n\nAt this point the house lit upon the idea of taking the eight words out\nof the Chairman's hands.  He was not unthankful for that.  Thenceforward\nhe held up each note in its turn and waited.  The house droned out the\neight words in a massed and measured and musical deep volume of sound\n(with a daringly close resemblance to a well-known church chant)--\"You\nare f-a-r from being a b-a-a-a-d man.\"  Then the Chair said, \"Signature,\r\n'Archibald Wilcox.'\"  And so on, and so on, name after name, and\neverybody had an increasingly and gloriously good time except the\nwretched Nineteen.  Now and then, when a particularly shining name was\ncalled, the house made the Chair wait while it chanted the whole of the\ntest-remark from the beginning to the closing words, \"And go to hell or\nHadleyburg--try and make it the for-or-m-e-r!\" and in these special cases\nthey added a grand and agonised and imposing \"A-a-a-a-_men_!\"\n\nThe list dwindled, dwindled, dwindled, poor old Richards keeping tally of\nthe count, wincing when a name resembling his own was pronounced, and\nwaiting in miserable suspense for the time to come when it would be his\nhumiliating privilege to rise with Mary and finish his plea, which he was intending to word thus: \". . . for until now we have never done any wrong\n","intending to word thus: \". . . for until now we have never done any wrong\nthing, but have gone our humble way unreproached.  We are very poor, we\nare old, and, have no chick nor child to help us; we were sorely tempted,\nand we fell.  It was my purpose when I got up before to make confession\nand beg that my name might not be read out in this public place, for it\nseemed to us that we could not bear it; but I was prevented.  It was\njust; it was our place to suffer with the rest.  It has been hard for us.\nIt is the first time we have ever heard our name fall from any one's\nlips--sullied.  Be merciful--for the sake or the better days; make our\nshame as light to bear as in your charity you can.\"  At this point in his\nreverie Mary nudged him, perceiving that his mind was absent.  The house\r\nwas chanting, \"You are f-a-r,\" etc.\n\n\"Be ready,\" Mary whispered.  \"Your name comes now; he has read eighteen.\"\n\nThe chant ended.\n\n\"Next! next! next!\" came volleying from all over the house.\n\nBurgess put his hand into his pocket.  The old couple, trembling, began\nto rise.  Burgess fumbled a moment, then said:\n\n\"I find I have read them all.\"\n\nFaint with joy and surprise, the couple sank into their seats, and Mary\nwhispered:\n\n\"Oh, bless God, we are saved!--he has lost ours--I wouldn't give this for\na hundred of those sacks!\"\n\nThe house burst out with its \"Mikado\" travesty, and sang it three times\nwith ever-increasing enthusiasm, rising to its feet when it reached for\nthe third time the closing line--\n\n   \"But the Symbols are here, you bet!\"\r\nand finishing up with cheers and a tiger for \"Hadleyburg purity and our\neighteen immortal representatives of it.\"\n\nThen Wingate, the saddler, got up and proposed cheers \"for the cleanest\nman in town, the one solitary important citizen in it who didn't try to\nsteal that money--Edward Richards.\"\n\nThey were given with great and moving heartiness; then somebody proposed\nthat \"Richards be elected sole Guardian and Symbol of the now Sacred\r\nHadleyburg Tradition, with power and right to stand up and look the whole\nsarcastic world in the face.\"\n\nPassed, by acclamation; then they sang the \"Mikado\" again, and ended it\nwith--\n\n   \"And there's _one_ Symbol left, you bet!\"\n\nThere was a pause; then--\n\nA Voice.  \"Now, then, who's to get the sack?\"\n\nThe Tanner (with bitter sarcasm).  \"That's easy.

Besides I could not kill you all--and, anyway, made as I am,\neven that would not have satisfied me.  I wanted to damage every man in\nthe place, and every woman--and not in their bodies or in their estate,\nbut in their vanity--the place where feeble and foolish people are most\nvulnerable.  So I disguised myself and came back and studied you.  You\nwere easy game.  You had an old and lofty reputation for honesty, and\nnaturally you were proud of it--it was your treasure of treasures, the\nvery apple of your eye.  As soon as I found out that you carefully and\nvigilantly kept yourselves and your children _out of temptation_, I knew\nhow to proceed.  Why, you simple creatures, the weakest of all weak\r\nthings is a virtue which has not been tested in the fire.  I laid a plan,\nand gathered a list of names.  My project was to corrupt Hadleyburg the\nIncorruptible.  My idea was to make liars and thieves of nearly half a\nhundred smirchless men and women who had never in their lives uttered a\nlie or stolen a penny.  I was afraid of Goodson.  He was neither born nor\nreared in Hadleyburg.  I was afraid that if I started to operate my\nscheme by getting my letter laid before you, you would say to yourselves,\n'Goodson is the only man among us who would give away twenty dollars to a\npoor devil'--and then you might not bite at my bait.  But heaven took\nGoodson; then I knew I was safe, and I set my trap and baited it.  It may\nbe that I shall not catch all the men to whom I mailed the pretended test-\r\nsecret, but I shall catch the most of them, if I know Hadleyburg nature.\n[Voices.  \"Right--he got every last one of them.\"]  I believe they will\neven steal ostensible _gamble_-money, rather than miss, poor, tempted,\nand mistrained fellows.  I am hoping to eternally and everlastingly\nsquelch your vanity and give Hadleyburg a new renown--one that will\n_stick_--and spread far.  If I have succeeded, open the sack and summon\nthe Committee on Propagation and Preservation of the Hadleyburg\nReputation.'\"\n\nA Cyclone of Voices.  \"Open it!  Open it!  The Eighteen to the front!\nCommittee on Propagation of the Tradition!  Forward--the Incorruptibles!\"\n\nThe Chair ripped the sack wide, and gathered up a handful of bright,\nbroad, yellow coins, shook them together, then examined them. \"Friends, they are only gilded disks of lead!\"\n","\"Friends, they are only gilded disks of lead!\"\n\nThere was a crashing outbreak of delight over this news, and when the\nnoise had subsided, the tanner called out:\n\n\"By right of apparent seniority in this business, Mr. Wilson is Chairman\nof the Committee on Propagation of the Tradition.  I suggest that he step\nforward on behalf of his pals, and receive in trust the money.\"\n\nA Hundred Voices.  \"Wilson!  Wilson!  Wilson!  Speech!  Speech!\"\n\nWilson [in a voice trembling with anger].  \"You will allow me to say, and\nwithout apologies for my language, _damn_ the money!\"\n\nA Voice.  \"Oh, and him a Baptist!\"\n\nA Voice.  \"Seventeen Symbols left!  Step up, gentlemen, and assume your\ntrust!\"\n\nThere was a pause--no response.\n\nThe Saddler.  \"Mr. Chairman, we've got _one_ clean man left, anyway, out\r\nof the late aristocracy; and he needs money, and deserves it.  I move\nthat you appoint Jack Halliday to get up there and auction off that sack\nof gilt twenty-dollar pieces, and give the result to the right man--the\nman whom Hadleyburg delights to honour--Edward Richards.\"\n\nThis was received with great enthusiasm, the dog taking a hand again; the\nsaddler started the bids at a dollar, the Brixton folk and Barnum's\nrepresentative fought hard for it, the people cheered every jump that the\nbids made, the excitement climbed moment by moment higher and higher, the\nbidders got on their mettle and grew steadily more and more daring, more\nand more determined, the jumps went from a dollar up to five, then to\nten, then to twenty, then fifty, then to a hundred, then--\r\nAt the beginning of the auction Richards whispered in distress to his\nwife: \"Oh, Mary, can we allow it?  It--it--you see, it is an\nhonour--reward, a testimonial to purity of character, and--and--can we\nallow it?  Hadn't I better get up and--Oh, Mary, what ought we to\ndo?--what do you think we--\" [Halliday's voice.  \"Fifteen I'm\nbid!--fifteen for the sack!--twenty!--ah, thanks!--thirty--thanks again!\nThirty, thirty, thirty!--do I hear forty?--forty it is!

He was now soliloquising\nsomewhat like this: \"None of the Eighteen are bidding; that is not\nsatisfactory; I must change that--the dramatic unities require it; they\nmust buy the sack they tried to steal; they must pay a heavy price,\ntoo--some of them are rich.  And another thing, when I make a mistake in\nHadleyburg nature the man that puts that error upon me is entitled to a\nhigh honorarium, and some one must pay.  This poor old Richards has\nbrought my judgment to shame; he is an honest man:--I don't understand\r\nit, but I acknowledge it.  Yes, he saw my deuces--_and_ with a straight\nflush, and by rights the pot is his.  And it shall be a jack-pot, too, if\nI can manage it.  He disappointed me, but let that pass.\"\n\nHe was watching the bidding.  At a thousand, the market broke: the prices\ntumbled swiftly.  He waited--and still watched.  One competitor dropped\nout; then another, and another.  He put in a bid or two now.  When the\nbids had sunk to ten dollars, he added a five; some one raised him a\nthree; he waited a moment, then flung in a fifty-dollar jump, and the\nsack was his--at $1,282.  The house broke out in cheers--then stopped;\nfor he was on his feet, and had lifted his hand.  He began to speak.\n\n\"I desire to say a word, and ask a favour.  I am a speculator in rarities, and I have dealings with persons interested in numismatics all\n","rarities, and I have dealings with persons interested in numismatics all\nover the world.  I can make a profit on this purchase, just as it stands;\nbut there is a way, if I can get your approval, whereby I can make every\none of these leaden twenty-dollar pieces worth its face in gold, and\nperhaps more.  Grant me that approval, and I will give part of my gains\nto your Mr. Richards, whose invulnerable probity you have so justly and\nso cordially recognised to-night; his share shall be ten thousand\ndollars, and I will hand him the money to-morrow.  [Great applause from\nthe house.  But the \"invulnerable probity\" made the Richardses blush\nprettily; however, it went for modesty, and did no harm.]  If you will\npass my proposition by a good majority--I would like a two-thirds vote--I\r\nwill regard that as the town's consent, and that is all I ask.  Rarities\nare always helped by any device which will rouse curiosity and compel\nremark.  Now if I may have your permission to stamp upon the faces of\neach of these ostensible coins the names of the eighteen gentlemen who--\"\n\nNine-tenths of the audience were on their feet in a moment--dog and\nall--and the proposition was carried with a whirlwind of approving\napplause and laughter.\n\nThey sat down, and all the Symbols except \"Dr.\" Clay Harkness got up,\nviolently protesting against the proposed outrage, and threatening to--\n\n\"I beg you not to threaten me,\" said the stranger calmly.  \"I know my\nlegal rights, and am not accustomed to being frightened at bluster.\"\n[Applause.]  He sat down.  \"Dr.\" Harkness saw an opportunity here.  He\r\nwas one of the two very rich men of the place, and Pinkerton was the\nother.  Harkness was proprietor of a mint; that is to say, a popular\npatent medicine.  He was running for the Legislature on one ticket, and\nPinkerton on the other.  It was a close race and a hot one, and getting\nhotter every day.  Both had strong appetites for money; each had bought a\ngreat tract of land, with a purpose; there was going to be a new railway,\nand each wanted to be in the Legislature and help locate the route to his\nown advantage; a single vote might make the decision, and with it two or\nthree fortunes.  The stake was large, and Harkness was a daring\nspeculator.  He was sitting close to the stranger.  He leaned over while\none or another of the other Symbols was entertaining the house with protests and appeals, and asked, in a whisper,\n\n\"What is your price for the sack?\"\n","protests and appeals, and asked, in a whisper,\n\n\"What is your price for the sack?\"\n\n\"Forty thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"I'll give you twenty.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Twenty-five.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Say thirty.\"\n\n\"The price is forty thousand dollars; not a penny less.\"\n\n\"All right, I'll give it.  I will come to the hotel at ten in the\nmorning.  I don't want it known; will see you privately.\"\n\n\"Very good.\"  Then the stranger got up and said to the house:\n\n\"I find it late.  The speeches of these gentlemen are not without merit,\nnot without interest, not without grace; yet if I may he excused I will\ntake my leave.  I thank you for the great favour which you have shown me\nin granting my petition.  I ask the Chair to keep the sack for me until\nto-morrow, and to hand these three five-hundred-dollar notes to Mr.\r\nRichards.\"  They were passed up to the Chair.\n\n\"At nine I will call for the sack, and at eleven will deliver the rest of\nthe ten thousand to Mr. Richards in person at his home.  Good-night.\"\n\nThen he slipped out, and left the audience making a vast noise, which was\ncomposed of a mixture of cheers, the \"Mikado\" song, dog-disapproval, and\nthe chant, \"You are f-a-r from being a b-a-a-d man--a-a-a a-men!\"\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nAt home the Richardses had to endure congratulations and compliments\nuntil midnight.  Then they were left to themselves.  They looked a little\nsad, and they sat silent and thinking.  Finally Mary sighed and said:\n\n\"Do you think we are to blame, Edward--_much_ to blame?\" and her eyes\nwandered to the accusing triplet of big bank-notes lying on the table,\r\nwhere the congratulators had been gloating over them and reverently\nfingering them.  Edward did not answer at once; then he brought out a\nsigh and said, hesitatingly:\n\n\"We--we couldn't help it, Mary.  It--well it was ordered.  _All_ things\nare.\"\n\nMary glanced up and looked at him steadily, but he didn't return the\nlook.  Presently she said:\n\n\"I thought congratulations and praises always tasted good.  But--it seems\r\nto me, now--Edward?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Are you going to stay in the bank?\"\n\n\"N--no.\"\n\n\"Resign?\"\n\n\"In the morning--by note.\"\n\n\"It does seem best.\"\n\nRichards bowed his head in his hands and muttered:\n\n\"Before I was not afraid to let oceans of people's money pour through my\nhands, but--Mary, I am so tired, so tired--\"\n\n\"We will go to bed.\"\n\nAt nine in the morning the stranger called for the sack and took it to the hotel in a cab.  At ten Harkness had a talk with him privately.  The\n","the hotel in a cab.  At ten Harkness had a talk with him privately.  The\nstranger asked for and got five cheques on a metropolitan bank--drawn to\n\"Bearer,\"--four for $1,500 each, and one for $34,000.  He put one of the\nformer in his pocket-book, and the remainder, representing $38,500, he\nput in an envelope, and with these he added a note which he wrote after\nHarkness was gone.  At eleven he called at the Richards' house and\nknocked.  Mrs. Richards peeped through the shutters, then went and\nreceived the envelope, and the stranger disappeared without a word.  She\ncame back flushed and a little unsteady on her legs, and gasped out:\n\n\"I am sure I recognised him!  Last night it seemed to me that maybe I had\nseen him somewhere before.\"\n\n\"He is the man that brought the sack here?\"\r\n\"I am almost sure of it.\"\n\n\"Then he is the ostensible Stephenson too, and sold every important\ncitizen in this town with his bogus secret.  Now if he has sent cheques\ninstead of money, we are sold too, after we thought we had escaped.  I\nwas beginning to feel fairly comfortable once more, after my night's\nrest, but the look of that envelope makes me sick.  It isn't fat enough;\n$8,500 in even the largest bank-notes makes more bulk than that.\"\n\n\"Edward, why do you object to cheques?\"\n\n\"Cheques signed by Stephenson!  I am resigned to take the $8,500 if it\ncould come in bank-notes--for it does seem that it was so ordered,\nMary--but I have never had much courage, and I have not the pluck to try\nto market a cheque signed with that disastrous name.  It would be a trap.\r\nThat man tried to catch me; we escaped somehow or other; and now he is\ntrying a new way.  If it is cheques--\"\n\n\"Oh, Edward, it is _too_ bad!\"  And she held up the cheques and began to\ncry.\n\n\"Put them in the fire! quick! we mustn't be tempted.  It is a trick to\nmake the world laugh at _us_, along with the rest, and--Give them to\n_me_, since you can't do it!\"  He snatched them and tried to hold his\r\ngrip till he could get to the stove; but he was human, he was a cashier,\nand he stopped a moment to make sure of the signature.  Then he came near\nto fainting.\n\n\"Fan me, Mary, fan me!  They are the same as gold!\"\n\n\"Oh, how lovely, Edward!  Why?\"\n\n\"Signed by Harkness.  What can the mystery of that be, Mary?\"\n\n\"Edward, do you think--\"\n\n\"Look here--look at this!  Fifteen--fifteen--fifteen--thirty-four.  Thirty- eight thousand five hundred!  Mary, the sack isn't worth twelve dollars,\n","eight thousand five hundred!  Mary, the sack isn't worth twelve dollars,\nand Harkness--apparently--has paid about par for it.\"\n\n\"And does it all come to us, do you think--instead of the ten thousand?\"\n\n\"Why, it looks like it.  And the cheques are made to 'Bearer,' too.\"\n\n\"Is that good, Edward?  What is it for?\"\n\n\"A hint to collect them at some distant bank, I reckon.  Perhaps Harkness\ndoesn't want the matter known.  What is that--a note?\"\n\n\"Yes.  It was with the cheques.\"\n\nIt was in the \"Stephenson\" handwriting, but there was no signature.  It\nsaid:\n\n   \"I am a disappointed man.  Your honesty is beyond the reach of\n   temptation.  I had a different idea about it, but I wronged you in\n   that, and I beg pardon, and do it sincerely.  I honour you--and that\r\nis sincere too.  This town is not worthy to kiss the hem of your\n   garment.  Dear sir, I made a square bet with myself that there were\n   nineteen debauchable men in your self-righteous community.  I have\n   lost.  Take the whole pot, you are entitled to it.\"\n\nRichards drew a deep sigh, and said:\n\n\"It seems written with fire--it burns so.  Mary--I am miserable again.\"\n\n\"I, too.  Ah, dear, I wish--\"\n\n\"To think, Mary--he _believes_ in me.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, don't, Edward--I can't bear it.\"\n\n\"If those beautiful words were deserved, Mary--and God knows I believed I\ndeserved them once--I think I could give the forty thousand dollars for\nthem.  And I would put that paper away, as representing more than gold\nand jewels, and keep it always.  But now--We could not live in the shadow\r\nof its accusing presence, Mary.\"\n\nHe put it in the fire.\n\nA messenger arrived and delivered an envelope.  Richards took from it a\nnote and read it; it was from Burgess:\n\n   \"You saved me, in a difficult time.  I saved you last night.  It was\n   at cost of a lie, but I made the sacrifice freely, and out of a\n   grateful heart.  None in this village knows so well as I know how\r\nbrave and good and noble you are.  At bottom you cannot respect me,\n   knowing as you do of that matter of which I am accused, and by the\n   general voice condemned; but I beg that you will at least believe that\n   I am a grateful man; it will help me to bear my burden.  [Signed]\n   'BURGESS.'\"\n\n\"Saved, once more.  And on such terms!\"  He put the note in the lire.\n\"I--I wish I were dead, Mary, I wish I were out of it all!\" \"Oh, these are bitter, bitter days, Edward.  The stabs, through their\n","\"Oh, these are bitter, bitter days, Edward.  The stabs, through their\nvery generosity, are so deep--and they come so fast!\"\n\nThree days before the election each of two thousand voters suddenly found\nhimself in possession of a prized memento--one of the renowned bogus\ndouble-eagles.  Around one of its faces was stamped these words: \"THE\nREMARK I MADE TO THE POOR STRANGER WAS--\"  Around the other face was\r\nstamped these: \"GO, AND REFORM.  [SIGNED] PINKERTON.\"  Thus the entire\nremaining refuse of the renowned joke was emptied upon a single head, and\nwith calamitous effect.  It revived the recent vast laugh and\nconcentrated it upon Pinkerton; and Harkness's election was a walk-over.\n\nWithin twenty-four hours after the Richardses had received their cheques\ntheir consciences were quieting down, discouraged; the old couple were\r\nlearning to reconcile themselves to the sin which they had committed.  But\nthey were to learn, now, that a sin takes on new and real terrors when\nthere seems a chance that it is going to be found out.  This gives it a\nfresh and most substantial and important aspect.  At church the morning\nsermon was of the usual pattern; it was the same old things said in the\nsame old way; they had heard them a thousand times and found them\ninnocuous, next to meaningless, and easy to sleep under; but now it was\ndifferent: the sermon seemed to bristle with accusations; it seemed aimed\nstraight and specially at people who were concealing deadly sins.  After\nchurch they got away from the mob of congratulators as soon as they\ncould, and hurried homeward, chilled to the bone at they did not know what--vague, shadowy, indefinite fears.  And by chance they caught a\n","what--vague, shadowy, indefinite fears.  And by chance they caught a\nglimpse of Mr. Burgess as he turned a corner.  He paid no attention to\ntheir nod of recognition!  He hadn't seen it; but they did not know that.\nWhat could his conduct mean?  It might mean--it might--mean--oh, a dozen\ndreadful things.  Was it possible that he knew that Richards could have\ncleared him of guilt in that bygone time, and had been silently waiting\nfor a chance to even up accounts?  At home, in their distress they got to\nimagining that their servant might have been in the next room listening\nwhen Richards revealed the secret to his wife that he knew of Burgess's\ninnocence; next Richards began to imagine that he had heard the swish of\na gown in there at that time; next, he was sure he _had_ heard it.  They\r\nwould call Sarah in, on a pretext, and watch her face; if she had been\nbetraying them to Mr. Burgess, it would show in her manner.  They asked\nher some questions--questions which were so random and incoherent and\nseemingly purposeless that the girl felt sure that the old people's minds\nhad been affected by their sudden good fortune; the sharp and watchful\ngaze which they bent upon her frightened her, and that completed the\nbusiness.  She blushed, she became nervous and confused, and to the old\npeople these were plain signs of guilt--guilt of some fearful sort or\nother--without doubt she was a spy and a traitor.  When they were alone\nagain they began to piece many unrelated things together and get horrible\nresults out of the combination.  When things had got about to the worst\r\nRichards was delivered of a sudden gasp and his wife asked:\n\n\"Oh, what is it?--what is it?\"\n\n\"The note--Burgess's note!  Its language was sarcastic, I see it now.\"  He\nquoted: \"'At bottom you cannot respect me, _knowing_, as you do, of _that\nmatter of_ which I am accused'--oh, it is perfectly plain, now, God help\nme!  He knows that I know!  You see the ingenuity of the phrasing.  It\nwas a trap--and like a fool, I walked into it.  And Mary--!\"\n\n\"Oh, it is dreadful--I know what you are going to say--he didn't return\nyour transcript of the pretended test-remark.\"\n\n\"No--kept it to destroy us with.  Mary, he has exposed us to some\nalready.  I know it--I know it well.  I saw it in a dozen faces after\nchurch.  Ah, he wouldn't answer our nod of recognition--he knew what he had been doing!\"\n","had been doing!\"\n\nIn the night the doctor was called.  The news went around in the morning\nthat the old couple were rather seriously ill--prostrated by the\nexhausting excitement growing out of their great windfall, the\ncongratulations, and the late hours, the doctor said.  The town was\nsincerely distressed; for these old people were about all it had left to\nbe proud of, now.\n\nTwo days later the news was worse.  The old couple were delirious, and\nwere doing strange things.  By witness of the nurses, Richards had\nexhibited cheques--for $8,500?  No--for an amazing sum--$38,500!  What\ncould be the explanation of this gigantic piece of luck?\n\nThe following day the nurses had more news--and wonderful.  They had\nconcluded to hide the cheques, lest harm come to them; but when they\r\nsearched they were gone from under the patient's pillow--vanished away.\nThe patient said:\n\n\"Let the pillow alone; what do you want?\"\n\n\"We thought it best that the cheques--\"\n\n\"You will never see them again--they are destroyed.  They came from\nSatan.  I saw the hell-brand on them, and I knew they were sent to betray\nme to sin.\"  Then he fell to gabbling strange and dreadful things which\r\nwere not clearly understandable, and which the doctor admonished them to\nkeep to themselves.\n\nRichards was right; the cheques were never seen again.\n\nA nurse must have talked in her sleep, for within two days the forbidden\ngabblings were the property of the town; and they were of a surprising\nsort.  They seemed to indicate that Richards had been a claimant for the\nsack himself, and that Burgess had concealed that fact and then\r\nmaliciously betrayed it.\n\nBurgess was taxed with this and stoutly denied it.  And he said it was\nnot fair to attach weight to the chatter of a sick old man who was out of\nhis mind.  Still, suspicion was in the air, and there was much talk.\n\nAfter a day or two it was reported that Mrs. Richards's delirious\ndeliveries were getting to be duplicates of her husband's.  Suspicion\nflamed up into conviction, now, and the town's pride in the purity of its\none undiscredited important citizen began to dim down and flicker toward\nextinction.\n\nSix days passed, then came more news.  The old couple were dying.\nRichards's mind cleared in his latest hour, and he sent for Burgess.\nBurgess said:\n\n\"Let the room be cleared.  I think he wishes to say something in\nprivacy.\" \"No!\" said Richards; \"I want witnesses.  I want you all to hear my\n","\"No!\" said Richards; \"I want witnesses.  I want you all to hear my\nconfession, so that I may die a man, and not a dog.  I was\nclean--artificially--like the rest; and like the rest I fell when\ntemptation came.  I signed a lie, and claimed the miserable sack.  Mr.\nBurgess remembered that I had done him a service, and in gratitude (and\nignorance) he suppressed my claim and saved me.  You know the thing that\r\nwas charged against Burgess years ago.  My testimony, and mine alone,\ncould have cleared him, and I was a coward and left him to suffer\ndisgrace--\"\n\n\"No--no--Mr. Richards, you--\"\n\n\"My servant betrayed my secret to him--\"\n\n\"No one has betrayed anything to me--\"\n\n--\"And then he did a natural and justifiable thing; he repented of the\nsaving kindness which he had done me, and he _exposed_ me--as I\r\ndeserved--\"\n\n\"Never!--I make oath--\"\n\n\"Out of my heart I forgive him.\"\n\nBurgess's impassioned protestations fell upon deaf ears; the dying man\npassed away without knowing that once more he had done poor Burgess a\nwrong.  The old wife died that night.\n\nThe last of the sacred Nineteen had fallen a prey to the fiendish sack;\nthe town was stripped of the last rag of its ancient glory.  Its mourning\nwas not showy, but it was deep.\n\nBy act of the Legislature--upon prayer and petition--Hadleyburg was\nallowed to change its name to (never mind what--I will not give it away),\nand

from the  chatto  windus edition by david price email\r\nccxcoventryacuk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe man that corrupted hadleyburg\r\n\r\n\r\ni\r\n\r\n\r\nit was many years ago  hadleyburg was the most honest and upright town\r\nin all the region round about  it had kept that reputation unsmirched\r\nduring three generations and was prouder of it than of any other of its\r\npossessions  it was so proud of it and so anxious to insure its\r\nperpetuation that it began to teach the principles of honest dealing to\r\nits babies in the cradle and made the like teachings the staple of their\r\nculture thenceforward through all the years devoted to their education\r\nalso throughout the formative years temptations were kept out of the way\r\nof the young people so that their honesty could have every chance to\r\nharden and solidify and become a part of their very bone  the\r\nneighbouring towns were jealous of this honourable supremacy and\r\naffected to sneer at hadleyburgs pride in it and call it vanity but all\r\nthe same they were obliged to acknowledge that hadleyburg was in reality\r\nan incorruptible town and if pressed they would also acknowledge that\r\nthe mere fact that a young man hailed from hadleyburg was all the\r\nrecommendation he needed when he went forth from his natal town to seek\r\nfor responsible employment\r\n\r\nbut at last in the drift of time hadleyburg had the ill luck to offend\r\na passing strangerpossibly without knowing it certainly without\r\ncaring for hadleyburg was sufficient unto itself and cared not a rap\r\nfor strangers or their opinions  still it would have been well to make\r\nan exception in this ones case for he was a bitter man and revengeful\r\nall through his wanderings during a whole year he kept his injury in\r\nmind and gave all his leisure moments to trying to invent a compensating\r\nsatisfaction for it  he contrived many plans and all of them were good\r\nbut none of them was quite sweeping enough the poorest of them would\r\nhurt a great many individuals but what he wanted was a plan which would\r\ncomprehend the entire town and not let so much as one person escape\r\nunhurt  at last he had a fortunate idea and when it fell into his brain\r\nit lit up his whole head with an evil joy  he began to form a plan at\r\nonce saying to himself that is the thing to doi will corrupt the\r\ntown\r\n\r\nsix months later he went to hadleyburg and arrived in a buggy at the\r\nhouse of the old cashier of the bank about ten at night  he got a sack\r\nout of the buggy shouldered it and staggered with it through the\r\ncottage yard and knocked at the door  a womans voice said come in\r\nand he entered and set his sack behind the stove in the parlour saying\r\npolitely to the old lady who sat reading the missionary herald by the\r\nlamp\r\n\r\npray keep your seat madam i will not disturb you  therenow it is\r\npretty well concealed one would hardly know it was there  can i see\r\nyour husband a moment madam\r\n\r\nno he was gone to brixton and might not return before morning\r\n\r\nvery well madam it is no matter  i merely wanted to leave that sack\r\nin his care to be delivered to the rightful owner when he shall be\r\nfound  i am a stranger he does not know me i am merely passing through\r\nthe town tonight to discharge a matter which has been long in my mind\r\nmy errand is now completed and i go pleased and a little proud and you\r\nwill never see me again  there is a paper attached to the sack which\r\nwill explain everything  goodnight madam\r\n\r\nthe old lady was afraid of the mysterious big stranger and was glad to\r\nsee him go  but her curiosity was roused and she went straight to the\r\nsack and brought away the paper  it began as follows\r\n\r\n   to be published or the right man sought out by private\r\n   inquiryeither will answer  this sack contains gold coin weighing a\r\n   hundred and sixty pounds four ounces\r\n\r\nmercy on us and the door not locked\r\n\r\nmrs richards flew to it all in a tremble and locked it then pulled down\r\nthe windowshades and stood frightened worried and wondering if there\r\nwas anything else she could do toward making herself and the money more\r\nsafe  she listened awhile for burglars then surrendered to curiosity\r\nand went back to the lamp and finished reading the paper\r\n\r\n   i am a foreigner and am presently going back to my own country to\r\n   remain there permanently  i am grateful to america for what i have\r\n   received at her hands during my long stay under her flag and to one\r\n   of her citizensa citizen of hadleyburgi am especially grateful for\r\n   a great kindness done me a year or two ago  two great kindnesses in\r\n   fact  i will explain  i was a gambler  i say i was  i was a ruined\r\n   gambler  i arrived in this village at night hungry and without a\r\n   penny  i asked for helpin the dark i was ashamed to beg in the\r\n   light  i begged of the right man  he gave me twenty dollarsthat is\r\n   to say he gave me life as i considered it  he also gave me fortune\r\n   for out of that money i have made myself rich at the gamingtable  and\r\n   finally a remark which he made to me has remained with me to this\r\n   day and has at last conquered me and in conquering has saved the\r\n   remnant of my morals i shall gamble no more  now i have no idea who\r\n   that man was but i want him found and i want him to have this money\r\n   to give away throw away or keep as he pleases  it is merely my way\r\n   of testifying my gratitude to him  if i could stay i would find him\r\n   myself but no matter he will be found  this is an honest town an\r\n   incorruptible town and i know i can trust it without fear  this man\r\n   can be identified by the remark which he made to me i feel persuaded\r\n   that he will remember it\r\n\r\n   and now my plan is this if you prefer to conduct the inquiry\r\n   privately do so  tell the contents of this present writing to any\r\n   one who is likely to be the right man  if he shall answer i am the\r\n   man the remark i made was soandso apply the testto wit open\r\n   the sack and in it you will find a sealed envelope containing that\r\n   remark  if the remark mentioned by the candidate tallies with it\r\n   give him the money and ask no further questions for he is certainly\r\n   the right man\r\n\r\n   but if you shall prefer a public inquiry then publish this present\r\n   writing in the local paperwith these instructions added to wit\r\n   thirty days from now let the candidate appear at the townhall at\r\n   eight in the evening friday and hand his remark in a sealed\r\n   envelope to the rev mr burgess if he will be kind enough to act\r\n   and let mr burgess there and then destroy the seals of the sack open\r\n   it and see if the remark is correct if correct let the money be\r\n   delivered with my sincere gratitude to my benefactor thus\r\n   identified\r\n\r\nmrs richards sat down gently quivering with excitement and was soon\r\nlost in thinkingsafter this pattern what a strange thing it is   \r\nand what a fortune for that kind man who set his bread afloat upon the\r\nwaters    if it had only been my husband that did itfor we are so\r\npoor so old and poor     then with a sighbut it was not my\r\nedward no it was not he that gave a stranger twenty dollars  it is a\r\npity too i see it now     then with a shudderbut it is\r\ngamblers money the wages of sin we couldnt take it we couldnt\r\ntouch it  i dont like to be near it it seems a defilement  she moved\r\nto a farther chair   i wish edward would come and take it to the\r\nbank a burglar might come at any moment it is dreadful to be here all\r\nalone with it\r\n\r\nat eleven mr richards arrived and while his wife was saying i am so\r\nglad youve come he was saying i am so tiredtired clear out it is\r\ndreadful to be poor and have to make these dismal journeys at my time of\r\nlife  always at the grind grind grind on a salaryanother mans\r\nslave and he sitting at home in his slippers rich and comfortable\r\n\r\ni am so sorry for you edward you know that but be comforted we have\r\nour livelihood we have our good name\r\n\r\nyes mary and that is everything  dont mind my talkits just a\r\nmoments irritation and doesnt mean anything  kiss methere its all\r\ngone now and i am not complaining any more  what have you been getting\r\nwhats in the sack\r\n\r\nthen his wife told him the great secret  it dazed him for a moment then\r\nhe said\r\n\r\nit weighs a hundred and sixty pounds  why mary its forty thousand\r\ndollarsthink of ita whole fortune  not ten men in this village are\r\nworth that much  give me the paper\r\n\r\nhe skimmed through it and said\r\n\r\nisnt it an adventure  why its a romance its like the impossible\r\nthings one reads about in books and never sees in life  he was well\r\nstirred up now cheerful even gleeful  he tapped his old wife on the\r\ncheek and said humorously why were rich mary rich all weve got\r\nto do is to bury the money and burn the papers  if the gambler ever\r\ncomes to inquire well merely look coldly upon him and say what is\r\nthis nonsense you are talking  we have never heard of you and your sack\r\nof gold before and then he would look foolish and\r\n\r\nand in the meantime while you are running on with your jokes the money\r\nis still here and it is fast getting along toward burglartime\r\n\r\ntrue  very well what shall we domake the inquiry private  no not\r\nthat it would spoil the romance  the public method is better  think\r\nwhat a noise it will make  and it will make all the other towns jealous\r\nfor no stranger would trust such a thing to any town but hadleyburg and\r\nthey know it  its a great card for us  i must get to the\r\nprintingoffice now or i shall be too late\r\n\r\nbut stopstopdont leave me here alone with it edward\r\n\r\nbut he was gone  for only a little while however  not far from his own\r\nhouse he met the editorproprietor of the paper and gave him the\r\ndocument and said here is a good thing for you coxput it in\r\n\r\nit may be too late mr richards but ill see\r\n\r\nat home again he and his wife sat down to talk the charming mystery\r\nover they were in no condition for sleep  the first question was who\r\ncould the citizen have been who gave the stranger the twenty dollars  it\r\nseemed a simple one both answered it in the same breath\r\n\r\nbarclay goodson\r\n\r\nyes said richards he could have done it and it would have been like\r\nhim but theres not another in the town\r\n\r\neverybody will grant that edwardgrant it privately anyway  for six\r\nmonths now the village has been its own proper self once morehonest\r\nnarrow selfrighteous and stingy\r\n\r\nit is what he always called it to the day of his deathsaid it right\r\nout publicly too\r\n\r\nyes and he was hated for it\r\n\r\noh of course but he didnt care  i reckon he was the besthated man\r\namong us except the reverend burgess\r\n\r\nwell burgess deserves ithe will never get another congregation here\r\nmean as the town is it knows how to estimate him  edward doesnt it\r\nseem odd that the stranger should appoint burgess to deliver the money\r\n\r\nwell yesit does  that isthat is\r\n\r\nwhy so much thatising  would you select him\r\n\r\nmary maybe the stranger knows him better than this village does\r\n\r\nmuch that would help burgess\r\n\r\nthe husband seemed perplexed for an answer the wife kept a steady eye\r\nupon him and waited  finally richards said with the hesitancy of one\r\nwho is making a statement which is likely to encounter doubt\r\n\r\nmary burgess is not a bad man\r\n\r\nhis wife was certainly surprised\r\n\r\nnonsense she exclaimed\r\n\r\nhe is not a bad man  i know  the whole of his unpopularity had its\r\nfoundation in that one thingthe thing that made so much noise\r\n\r\nthat one thing indeed  as if that one thing wasnt enough all by\r\nitself\r\n\r\nplenty  plenty  only he wasnt guilty of it\r\n\r\nhow you talk  not guilty of it  everybody knows he was guilty\r\n\r\nmary i give you my wordhe was innocent\r\n\r\ni cant believe it and i dont  how do you know\r\n\r\nit is a confession  i am ashamed but i will make it  i was the only\r\nman who knew he was innocent  i could have saved him andandwell\r\nyou know how the town was wrought upi hadnt the pluck to do it  it\r\nwould have turned everybody against me  i felt mean ever so mean ut i\r\ndidnt dare i hadnt the manliness to face that\r\n\r\nmary looked troubled and for a while was silent  then she said\r\nstammeringly\r\n\r\nii dont think it would have done for you totoone\r\nmustnterpublic opinionone has to be so carefulso  it was a\r\ndifficult road and she got mired but after a little she got started\r\nagain  it was a great pity butwhy we couldnt afford it edwardwe\r\ncouldnt indeed  oh i wouldnt have had you do it for anything\r\n\r\nit would have lost us the goodwill of so many people mary and\r\nthenand then\r\n\r\nwhat troubles me now is what he thinks of us edward\r\n\r\nhe  he doesnt suspect that i could have saved him\r\n\r\noh exclaimed the wife in a tone of relief i am glad of that  as\r\nlong as he doesnt know that you could have saved him hehewell that\r\nmakes it a great deal better  why i might have known he didnt know\r\nbecause he is always trying to be friendly with us as little\r\nencouragement as we give him  more than once people have twitted me with\r\nit  theres the wilsons and the wilcoxes and the harknesses they take\r\na mean pleasure in saying your friend burgess because they know it\r\npesters me  i wish he wouldnt persist in liking us so i cant think\r\nwhy he keeps it up\r\n\r\ni can explain it  its another confession  when the thing was new and\r\nhot and the town made a plan to ride him on a rail my conscience hurt\r\nme so that i couldnt stand it and i went privately and gave him notice\r\nand he got out of the town and stayed out till it was safe to come back\r\n\r\nedward  if the town had found it out\r\n\r\ndont  it scares me yet to think of it  i repented of it the minute\r\nit was done and i was even afraid to tell you lest your face might\r\nbetray it to somebody  i didnt sleep any that night for worrying  but\r\nafter a few days i saw that no one was going to suspect me and after\r\nthat i got to feeling glad i did it  and i feel glad yet maryglad\r\nthrough and through\r\n\r\nso do i now for it would have been a dreadful way to treat him  yes\r\nim glad for really you did owe him that you know  but edward\r\nsuppose it should come out yet some day\r\n\r\nit wont\r\n\r\nwhy\r\n\r\nbecause everybody thinks it was goodson\r\n\r\nof course they would\r\n\r\ncertainly  and of course he didnt care  they persuaded poor old\r\nsawlsberry to go and charge it on him and he went blustering over there\r\nand did it  goodson looked him over like as if he was hunting for a\r\nplace on him that he could despise the most then he says so you are\r\nthe committee of inquiry are you  sawlsberry said that was about what\r\nhe was  hm  do they require particulars or do you reckon a kind of a\r\ngeneral answer will do  if they require particulars i will come\r\nback mr goodson i will take the general answer first  very well\r\nthen tell them to go to helli reckon thats general enough  and ill\r\ngive you some advice sawlsberry when you come back for the particulars\r\nfetch a basket to carry what is left of yourself home in\r\n\r\njust like goodson its got all the marks  he had only one vanity he\r\nthought he could give advice better than any other person\r\n\r\nit settled the business and saved us mary  the subject was dropped\r\n\r\nbless you im not doubting that\r\n\r\nthen they took up the goldsack mystery again with strong interest  soon\r\nthe conversation began to suffer breaksinterruptions caused by absorbed\r\nthinkings  the breaks grew more and more frequent  at last richards\r\nlost himself wholly in thought  he sat long gazing vacantly at the\r\nfloor and byandby he began to punctuate his thoughts with little\r\nnervous movements of his hands that seemed to indicate vexation  meantime\r\nhis wife too had relapsed into a thoughtful silence and her movements\r\nwere beginning to show a troubled discomfort  finally richards got up\r\nand strode aimlessly about the room ploughing his hands through his\r\nhair much as a somnambulist might do who was having a bad dream  then\r\nhe seemed to arrive at a definite purpose and without a word he put on\r\nhis hat and passed quickly out of the house  his wife sat brooding with\r\na drawn face and did not seem to be aware that she was alone  now and\r\nthen she murmured lead us not into t    butbutwe are so poor so\r\npoor    lead us not into    ah who would be hurt by itand no\r\none would ever know    lead us      the voice died out in\r\nmumblings  after a little she glanced up and muttered in a\r\nhalffrightened halfglad way\r\n\r\nhe is gone  but oh dear he may be too latetoo late    maybe\r\nnotmaybe there is still time  she rose and stood thinking nervously\r\nclasping and unclasping her hands  a slight shudder shook her frame and\r\nshe said out of a dry throat god forgive meits awful to think such\r\nthingsbut    lord how we are madehow strangely we are made\r\n\r\nshe turned the light low and slipped stealthily over and knelt down by\r\nthe sack and felt of its ridgy sides with her hands and fondled them\r\nlovingly and there was a gloating light in her poor old eyes  she fell\r\ninto fits of absence and came half out of them at times to mutter if we\r\nhad only waitedoh if we had only waited a little and not been in\r\nsuch a hurry\r\n\r\nmeantime cox had gone home from his office and told his wife all about\r\nthe strange thing that had happened and they had talked it over eagerly\r\nand guessed that the late goodson was the only man in the town who could\r\nhave helped a suffering stranger with so noble a sum as twenty dollars\r\nthen there was a pause and the two became thoughtful and silent  and by\r\nandby nervous and fidgety  at last the wife said as if to herself\r\n\r\nnobody knows this secret but the richardses    and us    nobody\r\n\r\nthe husband came out of his thinkings with a slight start and gazed\r\nwistfully at his wife whose face was become very pale then he\r\nhesitatingly rose and glanced furtively at his hat then at his wifea\r\nsort of mute inquiry  mrs cox swallowed once or twice with her hand at\r\nher throat then in place of speech she nodded her head  in a moment she\r\nwas alone and mumbling to herself\r\n\r\nand now richards and cox were hurrying through the deserted streets from\r\nopposite directions  they met panting at the foot of the\r\nprintingoffice stairs by the nightlight there they read each others\r\nface  cox whispered\r\n\r\nnobody knows about this but us\r\n\r\nthe whispered answer was\r\n\r\nnot a soulon honour not a soul\r\n\r\nif it isnt too late to\r\n\r\nthe men were starting upstairs at this moment they were overtaken by a\r\nboy and cox asked\r\n\r\nis that you johnny\r\n\r\nyes sir\r\n\r\nyou neednt ship the early mailnor any mail wait till i tell you\r\n\r\nits already gone sir\r\n\r\ngone  it had the sound of an unspeakable disappointment in it\r\n\r\nyes sir  timetable for brixton and all the towns beyond changed to\r\nday sirhad to get the papers in twenty minutes earlier than common  i\r\nhad to rush if i had been two minutes later\r\n\r\nthe men turned and walked slowly away not waiting to hear the rest\r\nneither of them spoke during ten minutes then cox said in a vexed tone\r\n\r\nwhat possessed you to be in such a hurry i cant make out\r\n\r\nthe answer was humble enough\r\n\r\ni see it now but somehow i never thought you know until it was too\r\nlate  but the next time\r\n\r\nnext time be hanged  it wont come in a thousand years\r\n\r\nthen the friends separated without a goodnight and dragged themselves\r\nhome with the gait of mortally stricken men  at their homes their wives\r\nsprang up with an eager wellthen saw the answer with their eyes and\r\nsank down sorrowing without waiting for it to come in words  in both\r\nhouses a discussion followed of a heated sorta new thing there had\r\nbeen discussions before but not heated ones not ungentle ones  the\r\ndiscussions tonight were a sort of seeming plagiarisms of each other\r\nmrs richards said\r\n\r\nif you had only waited edwardif you had only stopped to think but\r\nno you must run straight to the printingoffice and spread it all over\r\nthe world\r\n\r\nit said publish it\r\n\r\nthat is nothing it also said do it privately if you liked  there\r\nnowis that true or not\r\n\r\nwhy yesyes it is true but when i thought what a stir it would make\r\nand what a compliment it was to hadleyburg that a stranger should trust\r\nit so\r\n\r\noh certainly i know all that but if you had only stopped to think\r\nyou would have seen that you couldnt find the right man because he is\r\nin his grave and hasnt left chick nor child nor relation behind him\r\nand as long as the money went to somebody that awfully needed it and\r\nnobody would be hurt by it andand\r\n\r\nshe broke down crying  her husband tried to think of some comforting\r\nthing to say and presently came out with this\r\n\r\nbut after all mary it must be for the bestit must be we know that\r\nand we must remember that it was so ordered\r\n\r\nordered  oh everythings ordered when a person has to find some way\r\nout when he has been stupid just the same it was ordered that the\r\nmoney should come to us in this special way and it was you that must\r\ntake it on yourself to go meddling with the designs of providenceand\r\nwho gave you the right  it was wicked that is what it wasjust\r\nblasphemous presumption and no more becoming to a meek and humble\r\nprofessor of\r\n\r\nbut mary you know how we have been trained all our lives long like\r\nthe whole village till it is absolutely second nature to us to stop not\r\na single moment to think when theres an honest thing to be done\r\n\r\noh i know it i know itits been one everlasting training and\r\ntraining and training in honestyhonesty shielded from the very cradle\r\nagainst every possible temptation and so its artificial honesty and\r\nweak as water when temptation comes as we have seen this night  god\r\nknows i never had shade nor shadow of a doubt of my petrified and\r\nindestructible honesty until nowand now under the very first big and\r\nreal temptation iedward it is my belief that this towns honesty is\r\nas rotten as mine is as rotten as yours  it is a mean town a hard\r\nstingy town and hasnt a virtue in the world but this honesty it is so\r\ncelebrated for and so conceited about and so help me i do believe that\r\nif ever the day comes that its honesty falls under great temptation its\r\ngrand reputation will go to ruin like a house of cards  there now ive\r\nmade confession and i feel better i am a humbug and ive been one all\r\nmy life without knowing it  let no man call me honest againi will not\r\nhave it\r\n\r\niwell mary i feel a good deal as you do i certainly do  it seems\r\nstrange too so strange  i never could have believed itnever\r\n\r\na long silence followed both were sunk in thought  at last the wife\r\nlooked up and said\r\n\r\ni know what you are thinking edward\r\n\r\nrichards had the embarrassed look of a person who is caught\r\n\r\ni am ashamed to confess it mary but\r\n\r\nits no matter edward i was thinking the same question myself\r\n\r\ni hope so  state it\r\n\r\nyou were thinking if a body could only guess out what the remark was\r\nthat goodson made to the stranger\r\n\r\nits perfectly true  i feel guilty and ashamed  and you\r\n\r\nim past it  let us make a pallet here weve got to stand watch till\r\nthe bank vault opens in the morning and admits the sack   oh dear oh\r\ndearif we hadnt made the mistake\r\n\r\nthe pallet was made and mary said\r\n\r\nthe open sesamewhat could it have been  i do wonder what that remark\r\ncould have been  but come we will get to bed now\r\n\r\nand sleep\r\n\r\nno think\r\n\r\nyes think\r\n\r\nby this time the coxes too had completed their spat and their\r\nreconciliation and were turning into think to think and toss and\r\nfret and worry over what the remark could possibly have been which\r\ngoodson made to the stranded derelict that golden remark that remark\r\nworth forty thousand dollars cash\r\n\r\nthe reason that the village telegraphoffice was open later than usual\r\nthat night was this the foreman of coxs paper was the local\r\nrepresentative of the associated press  one might say its honorary\r\nrepresentative for it wasnt four times a year that he could furnish\r\nthirty words that would be accepted  but this time it was different  his\r\ndespatch stating what he had caught got an instant answer\r\n\r\n   send the whole thingall the detailstwelve hundred words\r\n\r\na colossal order  the foreman filled the bill and he was the proudest\r\nman in the state  by breakfasttime the next morning the name of\r\nhadleyburg the incorruptible was on every lip in america from montreal\r\nto the gulf from the glaciers of alaska to the orangegroves of florida\r\nand millions and millions of people were discussing the stranger and his\r\nmoneysack and wondering if the right man would be found and hoping\r\nsome more news about the matter would come soonright away\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nii\r\n\r\n\r\nhadleyburg village woke up worldcelebratedastonishedhappyvain\r\nvain beyond imagination  its nineteen principal citizens and their wives\r\nwent about shaking hands with each other and beaming and smiling and\r\ncongratulating and saying this thing adds a new word to the\r\ndictionaryhadleyburg synonym for incorruptibledestined to live\r\nin dictionaries for ever  and the minor and unimportant citizens and\r\ntheir wives went around acting in much the same way  everybody ran to\r\nthe bank to see the goldsack and before noon grieved and envious crowds\r\nbegan to flock in from brixton and all neighbouring towns and that\r\nafternoon and next day reporters began to arrive from everywhere to\r\nverify the sack and its history and write the whole thing up anew and\r\nmake dashing freehand pictures of the sack and of richardss house and\r\nthe bank and the presbyterian church and the baptist church and the\r\npublic square and the townhall where the test would be applied and the\r\nmoney delivered and damnable portraits of the richardses and pinkerton\r\nthe banker and cox and the foreman and reverend burgess and the\r\npostmasterand even of jack halliday who was the loafing goodnatured\r\nnoaccount irreverent fisherman hunter boys friend straydogs\r\nfriend typical sam lawson of the town  the little mean smirking\r\noily pinkerton showed the sack to all comers and rubbed his sleek palms\r\ntogether pleasantly and enlarged upon the towns fine old reputation for\r\nhonesty and upon this wonderful endorsement of it and hoped and believed\r\nthat the example would now spread far and wide over the american world\r\nand be epochmaking in the matter of moral regeneration  and so on and\r\nso on\r\n\r\nby the end of a week things had quieted down again the wild intoxication\r\nof pride and joy had sobered to a soft sweet silent delighta sort of\r\ndeep nameless unutterable content  all faces bore a look of peaceful\r\nholy happiness\r\n\r\nthen a change came  it was a gradual change so gradual that its\r\nbeginnings were hardly noticed maybe were not noticed at all except by\r\njack halliday who always noticed everything and always made fun of it\r\ntoo no matter what it was  he began to throw out chaffing remarks about\r\npeople not looking quite so happy as they did a day or two ago and next\r\nhe claimed that the new aspect was deepening to positive sadness next\r\nthat it was taking on a sick look and finally he said that everybody was\r\nbecome so moody thoughtful and absentminded that he could rob the\r\nmeanest man in town of a cent out of the bottom of his breeches pocket\r\nand not disturb his reverie\r\n\r\nat this stageor at about this stagea saying like this was dropped at\r\nbedtimewith a sigh usuallyby the head of each of the nineteen\r\nprincipal households\r\n\r\nah what could have been the remark that goodson made\r\n\r\nand straightwaywith a shuddercame this from the mans wife\r\n\r\noh dont  what horrible thing are you mulling in your mind  put it\r\naway from you for gods sake\r\n\r\nbut that question was wrung from those men again the next nightand got\r\nthe same retort  but weaker\r\n\r\nand the third night the men uttered the question yet againwith anguish\r\nand absently  this timeand the following nightthe wives fidgeted\r\nfeebly and tried to say something  but didnt\r\n\r\nand the night after that they found their tongues and\r\nrespondedlongingly\r\n\r\noh if we could only guess\r\n\r\nhallidays comments grew daily more and more sparklingly disagreeable and\r\ndisparaging  he went diligently about laughing at the town\r\nindividually and in mass  but his laugh was the only one left in the\r\nvillage it fell upon a hollow and mournful vacancy and emptiness  not\r\neven a smile was findable anywhere  halliday carried a cigarbox around\r\non a tripod playing that it was a camera and halted all passers and\r\naimed the thing and said readynow look pleasant please but not\r\neven this capital joke could surprise the dreary faces into any\r\nsoftening\r\n\r\nso three weeks passedone week was left  it was saturday evening after\r\nsupper  instead of the aforetime saturdayevening flutter and bustle and\r\nshopping and larking the streets were empty and desolate  richards and\r\nhis old wife sat apart in their little parlourmiserable and thinking\r\nthis was become their evening habit now the lifelong habit which had\r\npreceded it of reading knitting and contented chat or receiving or\r\npaying neighbourly calls was dead and gone and forgotten ages agotwo\r\nor three weeks ago nobody talked now nobody read nobody visitedthe\r\nwhole village sat at home sighing worrying silent  trying to guess\r\nout that remark\r\n\r\nthe postman left a letter  richards glanced listlessly at the\r\nsuperscription and the postmarkunfamiliar bothand tossed the letter\r\non the table and resumed his mighthavebeens and his hopeless dull\r\nmiseries where he had left them off  two or three hours later his wife\r\ngot wearily up and was going away to bed without a goodnightcustom\r\nnowbut she stopped near the letter and eyed it awhile with a dead\r\ninterest then broke it open and began to skim it over  richards\r\nsitting there with his chair tilted back against the wall and his chin\r\nbetween his knees heard something fall  it was his wife  he sprang to\r\nher side but she cried out\r\n\r\nleave me alone i am too happy  read the letterread it\r\n\r\nhe did  he devoured it his brain reeling  the letter was from a\r\ndistant state and it said\r\n\r\n   i am a stranger to you but no matter i have something to tell  i\r\n   have just arrived home from mexico and learned about that episode  of\r\n   course you do not know who made that remark but i know and i am the\r\n   only person living who does know  it was goodson  i knew him well\r\n   many years ago  i passed through your village that very night and\r\n   was his guest till the midnight train came along  i overheard him\r\n   make that remark to the stranger in the darkit was in hale alley  he\r\n   and i talked of it the rest of the way home and while smoking in his\r\n   house  he mentioned many of your villagers in the course of his\r\n   talkmost of them in a very uncomplimentary way but two or three\r\n   favourably among these latter yourself  i say favourablynothing\r\n   stronger  i remember his saying he did not actually like any person\r\n   in the townnot one but that youi think he said youam almost\r\n   surehad done him a very great service once possibly without knowing\r\n   the full value of it and he wished he had a fortune he would leave\r\n   it to you when he died and a curse apiece for the rest of the\r\n   citizens  now then if it was you that did him that service you are\r\n   his legitimate heir and entitled to the sack of gold  i know that i\r\n   can trust to your honour and honesty for in a citizen of hadleyburg\r\n   these virtues are an unfailing inheritance and so i am going to\r\n   reveal to you the remark well satisfied that if you are not the right\r\n   man you will seek and find the right one and see that poor goodsons\r\n   debt of gratitude for the service referred to is paid  this is the\r\n   remark you are far from being a bad man go and reform\r\n\r\n   howard l stephenson\r\n\r\noh edward the money is ours and i am so grateful oh so\r\ngratefulkiss me dear its for ever since we kissedand we needed it\r\nsothe moneyand now you are free of pinkerton and his bank and\r\nnobodys slave any more it seems to me i could fly for joy\r\n\r\nit was a happy halfhour that the couple spent there on the settee\r\ncaressing each other it was the old days come againdays that had begun\r\nwith their courtship and lasted without a break till the stranger brought\r\nthe deadly money  byandby the wife said\r\n\r\noh edward how lucky it was you did him that grand service poor\r\ngoodson  i never liked him but i love him now  and it was fine and\r\nbeautiful of you never to mention it or brag about it  then with a\r\ntouch of reproach but you ought to have told me edward you ought to\r\nhave told your wife you know\r\n\r\nwell ierwell mary you see\r\n\r\nnow stop hemming and hawing and tell me about it edward  i always\r\nloved you and now im proud of you  everybody believes there was only\r\none good generous soul in this village and now it turns out that\r\nyouedward why dont you tell me\r\n\r\nwellererwhy mary i cant\r\n\r\nyou cant  why cant you\r\n\r\nyou see hewell hehe made me promise i wouldnt\r\n\r\nthe wife looked him over and said very slowly\r\n\r\nmadeyoupromise  edward what do you tell me that for\r\n\r\nmary do you think i would lie\r\n\r\nshe was troubled and silent for a moment then she laid her hand within\r\nhis and said\r\n\r\nno    no  we have wandered far enough from our bearingsgod spare\r\nus that  in all your life you have never uttered a lie  but nownow\r\nthat the foundations of things seem to be crumbling from under us\r\nwewe  she lost her voice for a moment then said brokenly lead us\r\nnot into temptation   i think you made the promise edward  let it\r\nrest so  let us keep away from that ground  nowthat is all gone by\r\nlet us he happy again it is no time for clouds\r\n\r\nedward found it something of an effort to comply for his mind kept\r\nwanderingtrying to remember what the service was that he had done\r\ngoodson\r\n\r\nthe couple lay awake the most of the night mary happy and busy edward\r\nbusy but not so happy  mary was planning what she would do with the\r\nmoney  edward was trying to recall that service  at first his\r\nconscience was sore on account of the lie he had told maryif it was a\r\nlie  after much reflectionsuppose it was a lie  what then  was it\r\nsuch a great matter  arent we always acting lies  then why not tell\r\nthem  look at marylook what she had done  while he was hurrying off\r\non his honest errand what was she doing  lamenting because the papers\r\nhadnt been destroyed and the money kept  is theft better than lying\r\n\r\nthat point lost its stingthe lie dropped into the background and left\r\ncomfort behind it  the next point came to the front had he rendered\r\nthat service  well here was goodsons own evidence as reported in\r\nstephensons letter there could be no better evidence than thatit was\r\neven proof that he had rendered it  of course  so that point was\r\nsettled   no not quite  he recalled with a wince that this unknown\r\nmr stephenson was just a trifle unsure as to whether the performer of it\r\nwas richards or some otherand oh dear he had put richards on his\r\nhonour  he must himself decide whither that money must goand mr\r\nstephenson was not doubting that if he was the wrong man he would go\r\nhonourably and find the right one  oh it was odious to put a man in\r\nsuch a situationah why couldnt stephenson have left out that doubt\r\nwhat did he want to intrude that for\r\n\r\nfurther reflection  how did it happen that richardss name remained in\r\nstephensons mind as indicating the right man and not some other mans\r\nname  that looked good  yes that looked very good  in fact it went on\r\nlooking better and better straight alonguntil byandby it grew into\r\npositive proof  and then richards put the matter at once out of his\r\nmind for he had a private instinct that a proof once established is\r\nbetter left so\r\n\r\nhe was feeling reasonably comfortable now but there was still one other\r\ndetail that kept pushing itself on his notice of course he had done that\r\nservicethat was settled but what was that service  he must recall\r\nithe would not go to sleep till he had recalled it it would make his\r\npeace of mind perfect  and so he thought and thought  he thought of a\r\ndozen thingspossible services even probable servicesbut none of them\r\nseemed adequate none of them seemed large enough none of them seemed\r\nworth the moneyworth the fortune goodson had wished he could leave in\r\nhis will  and besides he couldnt remember having done them anyway\r\nnow thennow thenwhat kind of a service would it be that would\r\nmake a man so inordinately grateful  ahthe saving of his soul  that\r\nmust be it  yes he could remember now how he once set himself the\r\ntask of converting goodson and laboured at it as much ashe was going\r\nto say three months but upon closer examination it shrunk to a month\r\nthen to a week then to a day then to nothing  yes he remembered now\r\nand with unwelcome vividness that goodson had told him to go to thunder\r\nand mind his own businesshe wasnt hankering to follow hadleyburg to\r\nheaven\r\n\r\nso that solution was a failurehe hadnt saved goodsons soul  richards\r\nwas discouraged  then after a little came another idea had he saved\r\ngoodsons property  no that wouldnt dohe hadnt any  his life  that\r\nis it  of course  why he might have thought of it before  this time\r\nhe was on the right track sure  his imaginationmill was hard at work\r\nin a minute now\r\n\r\nthereafter during a stretch of two exhausting hours he was busy saving\r\ngoodsons life  he saved it in all kinds of difficult and perilous ways\r\nin every case he got it saved satisfactorily up to a certain point then\r\njust as he was beginning to get well persuaded that it had really\r\nhappened a troublesome detail would turn up which made the whole thing\r\nimpossible  as in the matter of drowning for instance  in that case he\r\nhad swum out and tugged goodson ashore in an unconscious state with a\r\ngreat crowd looking on and applauding but when he had got it all thought\r\nout and was just beginning to remember all about it a whole swarm of\r\ndisqualifying details arrived on the ground the town would have known of\r\nthe circumstance mary would have known of it it would glare like a\r\nlimelight in his own memory instead of being an inconspicuous service\r\nwhich he had possibly rendered without knowing its full value  and at\r\nthis point he remembered that he couldnt swim anyway\r\n\r\nahthere was a point which he had been overlooking from the start it\r\nhad to be a service which he had rendered possibly without knowing the\r\nfull value of it  why really that ought to be an easy huntmuch\r\neasier than those others  and sure enough byandby he found it\r\ngoodson years and years ago came near marrying a very sweet and pretty\r\ngirl named nancy hewitt but in some way or other the match had been\r\nbroken off the girl died goodson remained a bachelor and byandby\r\nbecame a soured one and a frank despiser of the human species  soon\r\nafter the girls death the village found out or thought it had found\r\nout that she carried a spoonful of negro blood in her veins  richards\r\nworked at these details a good while and in the end he thought he\r\nremembered things concerning them which must have gotten mislaid in his\r\nmemory through long neglect  he seemed to dimly remember that it was\r\nhe that found out about the negro blood that it was he that told the\r\nvillage that the village told goodson where they got it that he thus\r\nsaved goodson from marrying the tainted girl that he had done him this\r\ngreat service without knowing the full value of it in fact without\r\nknowing that he was doing it but that goodson knew the value of it\r\nand what a narrow escape he had had and so went to his grave grateful to\r\nhis benefactor and wishing he had a fortune to leave him  it was all\r\nclear and simple now and the more he went over it the more luminous and\r\ncertain it grew and at last when he nestled to sleep satisfied and\r\nhappy he remembered the whole thing just as if it had been yesterday  in\r\nfact he dimly remembered goodsons telling him his gratitude once\r\nmeantime mary had spent six thousand dollars on a new house for herself\r\nand a pair of slippers for her pastor and then had fallen peacefully to\r\nrest\r\n\r\nthat same saturday evening the postman had delivered a letter to each of\r\nthe other principal citizensnineteen letters in all  no two of the\r\nenvelopes were alike and no two of the superscriptions were in the same\r\nhand but the letters inside were just like each other in every detail\r\nbut one  they were exact copies of the letter received by\r\nrichardshandwriting and alland were all signed by stephenson but in\r\nplace of richardss name each receivers own name appeared\r\n\r\nall night long eighteen principal citizens did what their castebrother\r\nrichards was doing at the same timethey put in their energies trying to\r\nremember what notable service it was that they had unconsciously done\r\nbarclay goodson  in no case was it a holiday job still they succeeded\r\n\r\nand while they were at this work which was difficult their wives put in\r\nthe night spending the money which was easy  during that one night the\r\nnineteen wives spent an average of seven thousand dollars each out of the\r\nforty thousand in the sacka hundred and thirtythree thousand\r\naltogether\r\n\r\nnext day there was a surprise for jack halliday  he noticed that the\r\nfaces of the nineteen chief citizens and their wives bore that expression\r\nof peaceful and holy happiness again  he could not understand it\r\nneither was he able to invent any remarks about it that could damage it\r\nor disturb it  and so it was his turn to be dissatisfied with life  his\r\nprivate guesses at the reasons for the happiness failed in all instances\r\nupon examination  when he met mrs wilcox and noticed the placid ecstasy\r\nin her face he said to himself her cat has had kittensand went and\r\nasked the cook it was not so the cook had detected the happiness but\r\ndid not know the cause  when halliday found the duplicate ecstasy in the\r\nface of shadbelly billson village nickname he was sure some\r\nneighbour of billsons had broken his leg but inquiry showed that this\r\nhad not happened  the subdued ecstasy in gregory yatess face could mean\r\nbut one thinghe was a motherinlaw short it was another mistake  and\r\npinkertonpinkertonhe has collected ten cents that he thought he was\r\ngoing to lose  and so on and so on  in some cases the guesses had to\r\nremain in doubt in the others they proved distinct errors  in the end\r\nhalliday said to himself anyway it roots up that theres nineteen\r\nhadleyburg families temporarily in heaven i dont know how it happened\r\ni only know providence is off duty today\r\n\r\nan architect and builder from the next state had lately ventured to set\r\nup a small business in this unpromising village and his sign had now\r\nbeen hanging out a week  not a customer yet he was a discouraged man\r\nand sorry he had come  but his weather changed suddenly now  first one\r\nand then another chief citizens wife said to him privately\r\n\r\ncome to my house monday weekbut say nothing about it for the present\r\nwe think of building\r\n\r\nhe got eleven invitations that day  that night he wrote his daughter and\r\nbroke off her match with her student  he said she could marry a mile\r\nhigher than that\r\n\r\npinkerton the banker and two or three other welltodo men planned\r\ncountryseatsbut waited  that kind dont count their chickens until\r\nthey are hatched\r\n\r\nthe wilsons devised a grand new thinga fancydress ball  they made no\r\nactual promises but told all their acquaintanceship in confidence that\r\nthey were thinking the matter over and thought they should give itand\r\nif we do you will be invited of course  people were surprised and\r\nsaid one to another why they are crazy those poor wilsons they\r\ncant afford it  several among the nineteen said privately to their\r\nhusbands it is a good idea we will keep still till their cheap thing\r\nis over then we will give one that will make it sick\r\n\r\nthe days drifted along and the bill of future squanderings rose higher\r\nand higher wilder and wilder more and more foolish and reckless  it\r\nbegan to look as if every member of the nineteen would not only spend his\r\nwhole forty thousand dollars before receivingday but be actually in\r\ndebt by the time he got the money  in some cases lightheaded people did\r\nnot stop with planning to spend they really spenton credit  they\r\nbought land mortgages farms speculative stocks fine clothes horses\r\nand various other things paid down the bonus and made themselves liable\r\nfor the restat ten days  presently the sober second thought came and\r\nhalliday noticed that a ghastly anxiety was beginning to show up in a\r\ngood many faces  again he was puzzled and didnt know what to make of\r\nit  the wilcox kittens arent dead for they werent born nobodys\r\nbroken a leg theres no shrinkage in motherinlaws nothing has\r\nhappenedit is an insolvable mystery\r\n\r\nthere was another puzzled man toothe rev mr burgess  for days\r\nwherever he went people seemed to follow him or to be watching out for\r\nhim and if he ever found himself in a retired spot a member of the\r\nnineteen would be sure to appear thrust an envelope privately into his\r\nhand whisper to be opened at the townhall friday evening then vanish\r\naway like a guilty thing  he was expecting that there might be one\r\nclaimant for the sackdoubtful however goodson being deadbut it\r\nnever occurred to him that all this crowd might be claimants  when the\r\ngreat friday came at last he found that he had nineteen envelopes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niii\r\n\r\n\r\nthe townhall had never looked finer  the platform at the end of it was\r\nbacked by a showy draping of flags at intervals along the walls were\r\nfestoons of flags the gallery fronts were clothed in flags the\r\nsupporting columns were swathed in flags all this was to impress the\r\nstranger for he would be there in considerable force and in a large\r\ndegree he would be connected with the press  the house was full  the\r\n fixed seats were occupied also the  extra chairs which had been\r\npacked into the aisles the steps of the platform were occupied some\r\ndistinguished strangers were given seats on the platform at the\r\nhorseshoe of tables which fenced the front and sides of the platform sat\r\na strong force of special correspondents who had come from everywhere  it\r\nwas the bestdressed house the town had ever produced  there were some\r\ntolerably expensive toilets there and in several cases the ladies who\r\nwore them had the look of being unfamiliar with that kind of clothes  at\r\nleast the town thought they had that look but the notion could have\r\narisen from the towns knowledge of the fact that these ladies had never\r\ninhabited such clothes before\r\n\r\nthe goldsack stood on a little table at the front of the platform where\r\nall the house could see it  the bulk of the house gazed at it with a\r\nburning interest a mouthwatering interest a wistful and pathetic\r\ninterest a minority of nineteen couples gazed at it tenderly lovingly\r\nproprietarily and the male half of this minority kept saying over to\r\nthemselves the moving little impromptu speeches of thankfulness for the\r\naudiences applause and congratulations which they were presently going\r\nto get up and deliver  every now and then one of these got a piece of\r\npaper out of his vest pocket and privately glanced at it to refresh his\r\nmemory\r\n\r\nof course there was a buzz of conversation going onthere always is but\r\nat last when the rev mr burgess rose and laid his hand on the sack he\r\ncould hear his microbes gnaw the place was so still  he related the\r\ncurious history of the sack then went on to speak in warm terms of\r\nhadleyburgs old and wellearned reputation for spotless honesty and of\r\nthe towns just pride in this reputation  he said that this reputation\r\nwas a treasure of priceless value that under providence its value had\r\nnow become inestimably enhanced for the recent episode had spread this\r\nfame far and wide and thus had focussed the eyes of the american world\r\nupon this village and made its name for all time as he hoped and\r\nbelieved a synonym for commercial incorruptibility  applause  and\r\nwho is to be the guardian of this noble famethe community as a whole\r\nno  the responsibility is individual not communal  from this day forth\r\neach and every one of you is in his

always henceforth know what we\r\nare  we do not know who he is but in your name i utter your gratitude\r\nand ask you to raise your voices in indorsement\r\n\r\nthe house rose in a body and made the walls quake with the thunders of\r\nits thankfulness for the space of a long minute  then it sat down and\r\nmr burgess took an envelope out of his pocket  the house held its\r\nbreath while he slit the envelope open and took from it a slip of paper\r\nhe read its contentsslowly and impressivelythe audience listening\r\nwith tranced attention to this magic document each of whose words stood\r\nfor an ingot of gold\r\n\r\nthe remark which i made to the distressed stranger was this you are\r\nvery far from being a bad man go and reform  then he continuedwe\r\nshall know in a moment now whether the remark here quoted corresponds\r\nwith the one concealed in the sack and if that shall prove to be soand\r\nit undoubtedly willthis sack of gold belongs to a fellowcitizen who\r\nwill henceforth stand before the nation as the symbol of the special\r\nvirtue which has made our town famous throughout the landmr billson\r\n\r\nthe house had gotten itself all ready to burst into the proper tornado of\r\napplause but instead of doing it it seemed stricken with a paralysis\r\nthere was a deep hush for a moment or two then a wave of whispered\r\nmurmurs swept the placeof about this tenor billson oh come this\r\nis too thin  twenty dollars to a strangeror anybodybillson\r\ntell it to the marines  and now at this point the house caught its\r\nbreath all of a sudden in a new access of astonishment for it discovered\r\nthat whereas in one part of the hall deacon billson was standing up with\r\nhis head weekly bowed in another part of it lawyer wilson was doing the\r\nsame  there was a wondering silence now for a while  everybody was\r\npuzzled and nineteen couples were surprised and indignant\r\n\r\nbillson and wilson turned and stared at each other  billson asked\r\nbitingly\r\n\r\nwhy do you rise mr wilson\r\n\r\nbecause i have a right to  perhaps you will be good enough to explain\r\nto the house why you rise\r\n\r\nwith great pleasure  because i wrote that paper\r\n\r\nit is an impudent falsity  i wrote it myself\r\n\r\nit was burgesss turn to be paralysed  he stood looking vacantly at\r\nfirst one of the men and then the other and did not seem to know what to\r\ndo  the house was stupefied  lawyer wilson spoke up now and said\r\n\r\ni ask the chair to read the name signed to that paper\r\n\r\nthat brought the chair to itself and it read out the name\r\n\r\njohn wharton billson\r\n\r\nthere shouted billson what have you got to say for yourself now  and\r\nwhat kind of apology are you going to make to me and to this insulted\r\nhouse for the imposture which you have attempted to play here\r\n\r\nno apologies are due sir and as for the rest of it i publicly charge\r\nyou with pilfering my note from mr burgess and substituting a copy of it\r\nsigned with your own name  there is no other way by which you could have\r\ngotten hold of the testremark i alone of living men possessed the\r\nsecret of its wording\r\n\r\nthere was likely to be a scandalous state of things if this went on\r\neverybody noticed with distress that the shorthand scribes were\r\nscribbling like mad many people were crying chair chair  order\r\norder  burgess rapped with his gavel and said\r\n\r\nlet us not forget the proprieties due  there has evidently been a\r\nmistake somewhere but surely that is all  if mr wilson gave me an\r\nenvelopeand i remember now that he didi still have it\r\n\r\nhe took one out of his pocket opened it glanced at it looked surprised\r\nand worried and stood silent a few moments  then he waved his hand in a\r\nwandering and mechanical way and made an effort or two to say something\r\nthen gave it up despondently  several voices cried out\r\n\r\nread it read it  what is it\r\n\r\nso he began in a dazed and sleepwalker fashion\r\n\r\nthe remark which i made to the unhappy stranger was this you are far\r\nfrom being a bad man  the house gazed at him marvelling  go and\r\nreform  murmurs amazing what can this mean  this one said the\r\nchair is signed thurlow g wilson\r\n\r\nthere cried wilson i reckon that settles it  i knew perfectly well\r\nmy note was purloined\r\n\r\npurloined retorted billson  ill let you know that neither you nor\r\nany man of your kidney must venture to\r\n\r\nthe chair order gentlemen order  take your seats both of you\r\nplease\r\n\r\nthey obeyed shaking their heads and grumbling angrily  the house was\r\nprofoundly puzzled it did not know what to do with this curious\r\nemergency  presently thompson got up  thompson was the hatter  he\r\nwould have liked to be a nineteener but such was not for him his stock\r\nof hats was not considerable enough for the position  he said\r\n\r\nmr chairman if i may be permitted to make a suggestion can both of\r\nthese gentlemen be right  i put it to you sir can both have happened\r\nto say the very same words to the stranger  it seems to me\r\n\r\nthe tanner got up and interrupted him  the tanner was a disgruntled man\r\nhe believed himself entitled to be a nineteener but he couldnt get\r\nrecognition  it made him a little unpleasant in his ways and speech\r\nsaid he\r\n\r\nsho thats not the point  that could happentwice in a hundred\r\nyearsbut not the other thing  neither of them gave the twenty\r\ndollars  a ripple of applause\r\n\r\nbillson  i did\r\n\r\nwilson  i did\r\n\r\nthen each accused the other of pilfering\r\n\r\nthe chair  order  sit down if you pleaseboth of you  neither of\r\nthe notes has been out of my possession at any moment\r\n\r\na voice  goodthat settles that\r\n\r\nthe tanner  mr chairman one thing is now plain one of these men has\r\nbeen eavesdropping under the other ones bed and filching family\r\nsecrets  if it is not unparliamentary to suggest it i will remark that\r\nboth are equal to it  the chair  order order  i withdraw the\r\nremark sir and will confine myself to suggesting that if one of them\r\nhas overheard the other reveal the testremark to his wife we shall\r\ncatch him now\r\n\r\na voice  how\r\n\r\nthe tanner  easily  the two have not quoted the remark in exactly the\r\nsame words  you would have noticed that if there hadnt been a\r\nconsiderable stretch of time and an exciting quarrel inserted between the\r\ntwo readings\r\n\r\na voice  name the difference\r\n\r\nthe tanner  the word very is in billsons note and not in the\r\nother\r\n\r\nmany voices  thats sohes right\r\n\r\nthe tanner  and so if the chair will examine the testremark in the\r\nsack we shall know which of these two fraudsthe chair\r\norderwhich of these two adventurersthe chair  order\r\norderwhich of these two gentlemenlaughter and applauseis\r\nentitled to wear the belt as being the first dishonest blatherskite ever\r\nbred in this townwhich he has dishonoured and which will be a sultry\r\nplace for him from now out  vigorous applause\r\n\r\nmany voices  open itopen the sack\r\n\r\nmr burgess made a slit in the sack slid his hand in and brought out an\r\nenvelope  in it were a couple of folded notes  he said\r\n\r\none of these is marked not to be examined until all written\r\ncommunications which have been addressed to the chairif anyshall have\r\nbeen read  the other is marked the test  allow me  it is\r\nwordedto wit\r\n\r\ni do not require that the first half of the remark which was made to me\r\nby my benefactor shall be quoted with exactness for it was not striking\r\nand could be forgotten but its closing fifteen words are quite striking\r\nand i think easily rememberable unless these shall be accurately\r\nreproduced let the applicant be regarded as an impostor  my benefactor\r\nbegan by saying he seldom gave advice to anyone but that it always bore\r\nthe hallmark of high value when he did give it  then he said thisand\r\nit has never faded from my memory you are far from being a bad\r\nman\r\n\r\nfifty voices  that settles itthe moneys wilsons  wilson  wilson\r\nspeech  speech\r\n\r\npeople jumped up and crowded around wilson wringing his hand and\r\ncongratulating ferventlymeantime the chair was hammering with the gavel\r\nand shouting\r\n\r\norder gentlemen  order  order  let me finish reading please  when\r\nquiet was restored the reading was resumedas follows\r\n\r\ngo and reformor mark my wordssome day for your sins you will\r\ndie and go to hell or hadleyburgtry and make it the former\r\n\r\na ghastly silence followed  first an angry cloud began to settle darkly\r\nupon the faces of the citizenship after a pause the cloud began to rise\r\nand a tickled expression tried to take its place tried so hard that it\r\nwas only kept under with great and painful difficulty the reporters the\r\nbrixtonites and other strangers bent their heads down and shielded their\r\nfaces with their hands and managed to hold in by main strength and\r\nheroic courtesy  at this most inopportune time burst upon the stillness\r\nthe roar of a solitary voicejack hallidays\r\n\r\nthats got the hallmark on it\r\n\r\nthen the house let go strangers and all  even mr burgesss gravity\r\nbroke down presently then the audience considered itself officially\r\nabsolved from all restraint and it made the most of its privilege  it\r\nwas a good long laugh and a tempestuously wholehearted one but it\r\nceased at lastlong enough for mr burgess to try to resume and for the\r\npeople to get their eyes partially wiped then it broke out again and\r\nafterward yet again then at last burgess was able to get out these\r\nserious words\r\n\r\nit is useless to try to disguise the factwe find ourselves in the\r\npresence of a matter of grave import  it involves the honour of your\r\ntownit strikes at the towns good name  the difference of a single\r\nword between the testremarks offered by mr wilson and mr billson was\r\nitself a serious thing since it indicated that one or the other of these\r\ngentlemen had committed a theft\r\n\r\nthe two men were sitting limp nerveless crushed but at these words\r\nboth were electrified into movement and started to get up\r\n\r\nsit down said the chair sharply and they obeyed  that as i have\r\nsaid was a serious thing  and it wasbut for only one of them  but\r\nthe matter has become graver for the honour of both is now in\r\nformidable peril  shall i go even further and say in inextricable\r\nperil  both left out the crucial fifteen words  he paused  during\r\nseveral moments he allowed the pervading stillness to gather and deepen\r\nits impressive effects then added there would seem to be but one way\r\nwhereby this could happen  i ask these gentlemenwas there\r\ncollusionagreement\r\n\r\na low murmur sifted through the house its import was hes got them\r\nboth\r\n\r\nbillson was not used to emergencies he sat in a helpless collapse  but\r\nwilson was a lawyer  he struggled to his feet pale and worried and\r\nsaid\r\n\r\ni ask the indulgence of the house while i explain this most painful\r\nmatter  i am sorry to say what i am about to say since it must inflict\r\nirreparable injury upon mr billson whom i have always esteemed and\r\nrespected until now and in whose invulnerability to temptation i\r\nentirely believedas did you all  but for the preservation of my own\r\nhonour i must speakand with frankness  i confess with shameand i now\r\nbeseech your pardon for itthat i said to the ruined stranger all of the\r\nwords contained in the testremark including the disparaging fifteen\r\nsensation  when the late publication was made i recalled them and i\r\nresolved to claim the sack of coin for by every right i was entitled to\r\nit  now i will ask you to consider this point and weigh it well that\r\nstrangers gratitude to me that night knew no bounds he said himself\r\nthat he could find no words for it that were adequate and that if he\r\nshould ever be able he would repay me a thousandfold  now then i ask\r\nyou this could i expectcould i believecould i even remotely\r\nimaginethat feeling as he did he would do so ungrateful a thing as to\r\nadd those quite unnecessary fifteen words to his testset a trap for\r\nmeexpose me as a slanderer of my own town before my own people\r\nassembled in a public hall  it was preposterous it was impossible  his\r\ntest would contain only the kindly opening clause of my remark  of that\r\ni had no shadow of doubt  you would have thought as i did  you would\r\nnot have expected a base betrayal from one whom you had befriended and\r\nagainst whom you had committed no offence  and so with perfect\r\nconfidence perfect trust i wrote on a piece of paper the opening\r\nwordsending with go and reformand signed it  when i was about to\r\nput it in an envelope i was called into my back office and without\r\nthinking i left the paper lying open on my desk  he stopped turned his\r\nhead slowly toward billson waited a moment then added i ask you to\r\nnote this when i returned a little latter mr billson was retiring by\r\nmy street door  sensation\r\n\r\nin a moment billson was on his feet and shouting\r\n\r\nits a lie  its an infamous lie\r\n\r\nthe chair  be seated sir  mr wilson has the floor\r\n\r\nbillsons friends pulled him into his seat and quieted him and wilson\r\nwent on\r\n\r\nthose are the simple facts  my note was now lying in a different place\r\non the table from where i had left it  i noticed that but attached no\r\nimportance to it thinking a draught had blown it there  that mr\r\nbillson would read a private paper was a thing which could not occur to\r\nme he was an honourable man and he would be above that  if you will\r\nallow me to say it i think his extra word very stands explained it\r\nis attributable to a defect of memory  i was the only man in the world\r\nwho could furnish here any detail of the testmarkby honourable\r\nmeans  i have finished\r\n\r\nthere is nothing in the world like a persuasive speech to fuddle the\r\nmental apparatus and upset the convictions and debauch the emotions of an\r\naudience not practised in the tricks and delusions of oratory  wilson\r\nsat down victorious  the house submerged him in tides of approving\r\napplause friends swarmed to him and shook him by the hand and\r\ncongratulated him and billson was shouted down and not allowed to say a\r\nword  the chair hammered and hammered with its gavel and kept shouting\r\n\r\nbut let us proceed gentlemen let us proceed\r\n\r\nat last there was a measurable degree of quiet and the hatter said\r\n\r\nbut what is there to proceed with sir but to deliver the money\r\n\r\nvoices  thats it  thats it  come forward wilson\r\n\r\nthe hatter  i move three cheers for mr wilson symbol of the special\r\nvirtue which\r\n\r\nthe cheers burst forth before he could finish and in the midst of\r\nthemand in the midst of the clamour of the gavel alsosome enthusiasts\r\nmounted wilson on a big friends shoulder and were going to fetch him in\r\ntriumph to the platform  the chairs voice now rose above the noise\r\n\r\norder  to your places  you forget that there is still a document to be\r\nread  when quiet had been restored he took up the document and was\r\ngoing to read it but laid it down again saying i forgot this is not to\r\nbe read until all written communications received by me have first been\r\nread  he took an envelope out of his pocket removed its enclosure\r\nglanced at itseemed astonishedheld it out and gazed at itstared at\r\nit\r\n\r\ntwenty or thirty voices cried out\r\n\r\nwhat is it  read it read

 oh saw my leg off  signed by\r\nmr pinkerton the banker\r\n\r\nthe pandemonium of delight which turned itself loose now was of a sort to\r\nmake the judicious weep  those whose withers were unwrung laughed till\r\nthe tears ran down the reporters in throes of laughter set down\r\ndisordered pothooks which would never in the world be decipherable and\r\na sleeping dog jumped up scared out of its wits and barked itself crazy\r\nat the turmoil  all manner of cries were scattered through the din\r\nwere getting richtwo symbols of incorruptibilitywithout counting\r\nbillson  threecount shadbelly inwe cant have too many  all\r\nrightbillsons elected  alas poor wilson victim of two thieves\r\n\r\na powerful voice  silence  the chairs fished up something more out of\r\nits pocket\r\n\r\nvoices

distressed got up and began to work their way towards the aisles\r\nbut a score of shouts went up\r\n\r\nthe doors the doorsclose the doors no incorruptible shall leave this\r\nplace  sit down

joy then just in time somebody\r\ncontributed another line\r\n\r\n   and dont you this forget\r\n\r\nthe house roared it out  a third line was at once furnished\r\n\r\n   corruptibles far from hadleyburg are\r\n\r\nthe house roared that one too  as the last note died jack hallidays\r\nvoice rose high and clear freighted with a final line\r\n\r\n   but the symbols are here you bet\r\n\r\nthat was sung with booming enthusiasm  then the happy house started in\r\nat the beginning and sang the four lines through twice with immense\r\nswing and dash and finished up with a crashing threetimesthree and a\r\ntiger for hadleyburg the incorruptible and all symbols of it which we\r\nshall find worthy to receive the hallmark tonight\r\n\r\nthen the shoutings at the chair began again all over the place\r\n\r\ngo on go on  read read some more  read all youve got\r\n\r\nthats itgo on  we are winning eternal celebrity\r\n\r\na dozen men got up now and began to protest

you are confessing  well find your\r\nnames in the lot\r\n\r\nmr chairman how many of those envelopes have you got\r\n\r\nthe chair counted\r\n\r\ntogether with those that have been already examined there are\r\nnineteen\r\n\r\na storm of derisive applause broke out\r\n\r\nperhaps they all contain the secret  i move that you open them all and\r\nread every signature that is attached to a note of that sortand read\r\nalso the first eight words of the note\r\n\r\nsecond the motion\r\n\r\nit was put and carrieduproariously  then poor old richards got up and\r\nhis wife rose and stood at his side  her head was bent down so that\r\nnone might see that she was crying  her husband gave her his arm and so\r\nsupporting her he began to speak in a quavering voice\r\n\r\nmy friends you have known us

delivered the cheers\r\nwith all its affectionate heart\r\n\r\nthe chair then continued\r\n\r\nwhat i was going to say is this we know your good heart mr richards\r\nbut this is not a time for the

ourselves\r\n\r\nstraightway the jollity broke loose again with the reading of the names\r\n\r\nyou are far from being a bad man signature robert j titmarsh\r\n\r\nyou are far from being a bad man signature eliphalet weeks\r\n\r\nyou are far from being a bad man signature oscar b wilder\r\n\r\nat this point the house lit upon the idea of taking the eight words out\r\nof the chairmans hands  he was not unthankful for that  thenceforward\r\nhe held up each note in its turn and waited  the house droned out the\r\neight words in a massed and measured and musical deep volume of sound\r\nwith a daringly close resemblance to a wellknown church chantyou\r\nare far from being a baaad man  then the chair said signature\r\narchibald wilcox  and so on and so on name after name and\r\neverybody had an increasingly and gloriously good time except the\r\nwretched nineteen  now and then when a particularly shining name was\r\ncalled the house made the chair wait while it chanted the whole of the\r\ntestremark from the beginning to the closing words and go to hell or\r\nhadleyburgtry and make it the forormer and in these special cases\r\nthey added a grand and agonised and imposing aaaamen\r\n\r\nthe list dwindled dwindled dwindled poor old richards keeping tally of\r\nthe count wincing when a name resembling his own was pronounced and\r\nwaiting in miserable suspense for the time to come when it would be his\r\nhumiliating privilege to rise with mary and finish his plea which he was\r\nintending to word thus    for until now we have never done any wrong\r\nthing but have gone our humble way unreproached  we are very poor we\r\nare old and have no chick nor child to help us we were sorely tempted\r\nand we fell  it was my purpose when i got up before to make confession\r\nand beg that my name might not be read out in this public place for it\r\nseemed to us that we could not bear it but i was prevented  it was\r\njust it was our place to suffer with the rest  it has been hard for us\r\nit is the first time we have ever heard our name fall from any ones\r\nlipssullied  be mercifulfor the sake or the better days make our\r\nshame as light to bear as in your charity you can  at this point in his\r\nreverie mary nudged him perceiving that his mind was absent  the house\r\nwas chanting you are far etc\r\n\r\nbe ready mary whispered  your name comes now he has read eighteen\r\n\r\nthe chant ended\r\n\r\nnext next next came volleying from all over the house\r\n\r\nburgess put his hand into his pocket  the old couple trembling began\r\nto rise  burgess fumbled a moment then said\r\n\r\ni find i have read them all\r\n\r\nfaint with joy and surprise the couple sank into their seats and mary\r\nwhispered\r\n\r\noh bless god we are savedhe has lost oursi wouldnt give this for\r\na hundred of those sacks\r\n\r\nthe house burst out with its mikado travesty and sang it three times\r\nwith everincreasing enthusiasm rising to its feet when it reached for\r\nthe third time the closing line\r\n\r\n   but the symbols are here you bet\r\n\r\nand finishing up with cheers and a tiger for hadleyburg purity and our\r\neighteen immortal representatives of it\r\n\r\nthen wingate the saddler got up and proposed cheers for the cleanest\r\nman in town the one solitary important citizen in it who didnt try to\r\nsteal that moneyedward richards\r\n\r\nthey were given with great and moving heartiness then somebody proposed\r\nthat richards be elected sole guardian and symbol of the now sacred\r\nhadleyburg tradition with power and right to stand up and look the whole\r\nsarcastic world in the face\r\n\r\npassed by acclamation then they sang the mikado again and ended it\r\nwith\r\n\r\n   and theres one symbol left you bet\r\n\r\nthere was a pause then\r\n\r\na voice  now then whos to get the sack\r\n\r\nthe tanner with bitter sarcasm  thats easy  the money has to be\r\ndivided among the eighteen incorruptibles  they gave the suffering\r\nstranger twenty dollars apieceand that remarkeach in his turnit\r\ntook twentytwo minutes for the procession to move past  staked the\r\nstrangertotal contribution $  all they want is just the loan\r\nbackand interestforty thousand dollars altogether\r\n\r\nmany voices derisively  thats it  divvy divvy  be kind to the\r\npoordont keep them waiting\r\n\r\nthe chair  order  i now offer the strangers remaining document  it\r\nsays if no claimant shall appear grand chorus of groans i desire\r\nthat you open the sack and count out the money to the principal citizens\r\nof your town they to take it in trust cries of oh oh oh and use\r\nit in such ways as to them shall seem best for the propagation and\r\npreservation of your communitys noble reputation for incorruptible\r\nhonesty more criesa reputation to which their names and their efforts\r\nwill add a new and farreaching lustre  enthusiastic outburst of\r\nsarcastic applause  that seems to be all  nohere is a postscript\r\n\r\npscitizens of hadleyburg there is no testremarknobody made\r\none  great sensation  there wasnt any pauper stranger nor any\r\ntwentydollar contribution nor any accompanying benediction and\r\ncomplimentthese are all inventions  general buzz and hum of\r\nastonishment and delight  allow me to tell my storyit will take but a\r\nword or two  i passed through your town at a certain time and received\r\na deep offence which i had not earned  any other man would have been\r\ncontent to kill one or two of you and call it square but to me that\r\nwould have been a trivial revenge and inadequate for the dead do not\r\nsuffer besides i could not kill you alland anyway made as i am\r\neven that would not have satisfied me  i wanted to damage every man in\r\nthe place and every womanand not in their bodies or in their estate\r\nbut in their vanitythe place where feeble and foolish people are most\r\nvulnerable  so i disguised myself and came back and studied you  you\r\nwere easy game  you had an old and lofty reputation for honesty and\r\nnaturally you were proud of itit was your treasure of treasures the\r\nvery apple of your eye  as soon as i found out that you carefully and\r\nvigilantly kept yourselves and your children out of temptation i knew\r\nhow to proceed  why you simple creatures the weakest of all weak\r\nthings is a virtue which has not been tested in the fire  i laid a plan\r\nand gathered a list of names  my project was to corrupt hadleyburg the\r\nincorruptible  my idea was to make liars and thieves of nearly half a\r\nhundred smirchless men and women who had never in their lives uttered a\r\nlie or stolen a penny  i was afraid of goodson  he was neither born nor\r\nreared in hadleyburg  i was afraid that if i started to operate my\r\nscheme by getting my letter laid before you you would say to yourselves\r\ngoodson is the only man among us who would give away twenty dollars to a\r\npoor deviland then you might not bite at my bait  but heaven took\r\ngoodson then i knew i was safe and i set my trap and baited it  it may\r\nbe that i shall not catch all the men to whom i mailed the pretended test\r\nsecret but i shall catch the most of them if i know hadleyburg nature\r\nvoices  righthe got every last one of them  i believe they will\r\neven steal ostensible gamblemoney rather than miss poor tempted\r\nand mistrained fellows  i am hoping to eternally and everlastingly\r\nsquelch your vanity and give hadleyburg a new renownone that will\r\nstickand spread far  if i have succeeded open the sack and summon\r\nthe committee on propagation and preservation of the hadleyburg\r\nreputation\r\n\r\na cyclone of voices  open it  open it  the eighteen to the front\r\ncommittee on propagation of the tradition  forwardthe incorruptibles\r\n\r\nthe chair ripped the sack wide and gathered up a handful of bright\r\nbroad yellow coins shook them together then examined them\r\n\r\nfriends they are only gilded disks of lead\r\n\r\nthere was a crashing outbreak of delight over this news and when the\r\nnoise had subsided the tanner called out\r\n\r\nby right of apparent seniority in this business mr wilson is chairman\r\nof the committee on propagation of the tradition  i suggest that he step\r\nforward on behalf of his pals and receive in trust the money\r\n\r\na hundred voices

out\r\nof the late aristocracy and he needs money and deserves it  i move\r\nthat you appoint jack halliday to get up there and auction off that sack\r\nof gilt twentydollar pieces and give the result to the right manthe\r\nman whom hadleyburg delights to honouredward richards\r\n\r\nthis was received with great enthusiasm the dog taking a hand again the\r\nsaddler started the bids at a dollar the brixton folk and barnums\r\nrepresentative fought hard for it the people cheered every jump that the\r\nbids made the excitement climbed moment by moment higher and higher the\r\nbidders got on their mettle and grew steadily more and more daring more\r\nand more determined the jumps went from a dollar up to five then to\r\nten then to twenty then fifty then to a hundred then\r\n\r\nat the

was not\r\nsatisfied but which was overpowered by circumstances\r\n\r\nmeantime a stranger who looked like an amateur detective gotten up as an\r\nimpossible english earl had been watching the evenings proceedings with\r\nmanifest interest and with a contented expression in his face and he\r\nhad been privately commenting to himself  he was now soliloquising\r\nsomewhat like this none of the eighteen are bidding that is not\r\nsatisfactory i must change thatthe dramatic unities require it they\r\nmust buy the sack they tried to steal they must pay a heavy price\r\ntoosome of them are rich  and another thing when i make a mistake in\r\nhadleyburg nature the man that puts that error upon me is entitled to a\r\nhigh honorarium and some one must pay  this poor old richards has\r\nbrought my judgment to shame he is an honest mani dont understand\r\nit but i acknowledge it  yes he saw my deucesand with a straight\r\nflush and by rights the pot is his  and it shall be a jackpot too if\r\ni can manage it  he disappointed me but let that pass\r\n\r\nhe was watching the bidding  at a thousand the market broke the prices\r\ntumbled swiftly  he waitedand still watched  one competitor dropped\r\nout then another and another  he put in a bid or two now  when the\r\nbids had sunk to ten dollars he added a five some one raised him a\r\nthree he waited a moment then flung in a fiftydollar jump and the\r\nsack was hisat $  the house broke out in cheersthen stopped\r\nfor he was on his feet and had lifted his hand  he began to speak\r\n\r\ni desire to say a word and ask a favour  i am a speculator in\r\nrarities and i have dealings with persons interested in numismatics all\r\nover the world  i can make a profit on this purchase just as it stands\r\nbut there is a way if i can get your approval whereby i can make every\r\none of these leaden twentydollar pieces worth its face in gold and\r\nperhaps more  grant me that approval and i will give part of my gains\r\nto your mr richards whose invulnerable probity you have so justly and\r\nso cordially recognised tonight his share shall be ten thousand\r\ndollars and i will hand him the money tomorrow  great applause from\r\nthe house  but the invulnerable probity made the richardses blush\r\nprettily however it went for modesty and did no harm  if you will\r\npass my proposition by a good majorityi would like a twothirds votei\r\nwill regard that as the towns consent and that is all i ask  rarities\r\nare always helped by any device which will rouse curiosity and compel\r\nremark  now if i may have your permission to stamp upon the faces of\r\neach of these ostensible coins the names of the eighteen gentlemen who\r\n\r\nninetenths of the audience were on their feet in a momentdog and\r\nalland the proposition was carried with a whirlwind of approving\r\napplause and laughter\r\n\r\nthey sat down and all the symbols except dr clay harkness got up\r\nviolently protesting against the proposed outrage and threatening to\r\n\r\ni beg you not to threaten me said the stranger calmly  i know my\r\nlegal rights and am not accustomed to being frightened at bluster\r\napplause  he sat down  dr harkness saw an opportunity here  he\r\nwas one of the two very rich men of the place and pinkerton was the\r\nother  harkness was proprietor of a mint that is to say a popular\r\npatent medicine  he was running for the legislature on one ticket and\r\npinkerton on the other  it was a close race and a hot one and getting\r\nhotter every day  both had strong appetites for money each had bought a\r\ngreat tract of land with a purpose there was going to be a new railway\r\nand each wanted to be in the legislature and help locate the route to his\r\nown advantage a single vote might make the decision and with it two or\r\nthree fortunes  the stake was large and harkness was a daring\r\nspeculator  he was sitting close to the stranger  he leaned over while\r\none or another of the other symbols was entertaining the house with\r\nprotests and appeals and asked in a whisper\r\n\r\nwhat is your price for the sack\r\n\r\nforty thousand dollars\r\n\r\nill give you twenty\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\ntwentyfive\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\nsay thirty\r\n\r\nthe price is forty thousand dollars not a penny less\r\n\r\nall right ill give it  i will come to the hotel at ten in the\r\nmorning  i dont want it known will see you privately\r\n\r\nvery good  then the stranger got up and said to the house\r\n\r\ni find it late  the speeches of these gentlemen are not without merit\r\nnot without interest not without grace yet if i may he excused i will\r\ntake my leave  i thank you for the great favour which you have shown me\r\nin granting my petition  i ask the chair to keep the sack for me until\r\ntomorrow and to hand these three fivehundreddollar notes to mr\r\nrichards  they were passed up to the chair\r\n\r\nat nine i will call for the sack and at eleven will deliver the rest of\r\nthe ten thousand to mr richards in person at his home  goodnight\r\n\r\nthen he slipped out and left the audience making a vast noise which was\r\ncomposed of a mixture of cheers the mikado song dogdisapproval and\r\nthe chant you are far from being a baad manaaa amen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niv\r\n\r\n\r\nat home the richardses had to endure congratulations and compliments\r\nuntil midnight  then they were left to themselves  they looked a little\r\nsad and they sat silent and thinking  finally mary sighed and said\r\n\r\ndo you think we are to blame edwardmuch to blame and her eyes\r\nwandered to the accusing triplet of big banknotes lying on the table\r\nwhere the congratulators had been gloating over them and reverently\r\nfingering them  edward did not answer at once then he brought out a\r\nsigh and said hesitatingly\r\n\r\nwewe couldnt help it mary  itwell it was ordered  all things\r\nare\r\n\r\nmary glanced up and looked at him steadily but he didnt return the\r\nlook  presently she said\r\n\r\ni thought congratulations and praises always tasted good  butit seems\r\nto me nowedward\r\n\r\nwell\r\n\r\nare you going to stay in the bank\r\n\r\nnno\r\n\r\nresign\r\n\r\nin the morningby note\r\n\r\nit does seem best\r\n\r\nrichards bowed his head in his hands and muttered\r\n\r\nbefore i was not afraid to let oceans of peoples money pour through my\r\nhands butmary i am so tired so tired\r\n\r\nwe will go to bed\r\n\r\nat nine in the morning the stranger called for the sack and took it to\r\nthe hotel in a cab  at ten harkness had a talk with him privately  the\r\nstranger asked for and got five cheques on a metropolitan bankdrawn to\r\nbearerfour for $ each and one for $  he put one of the\r\nformer in his pocketbook and the remainder representing $ he\r\nput in an envelope and with these he added a note which he wrote after\r\nharkness was gone  at eleven he called at the richards house and\r\nknocked  mrs richards peeped through the shutters then went and\r\nreceived the envelope and the stranger disappeared without a word  she\r\ncame back flushed and a little unsteady on her legs and gasped out\r\n\r\ni am sure i recognised him  last night it seemed to me that maybe i had\r\nseen him somewhere before\r\n\r\nhe is the man that brought the sack here\r\n\r\ni am almost sure of it\r\n\r\nthen he is the ostensible stephenson too and sold every important\r\ncitizen in this town with his bogus secret  now if he has sent cheques\r\ninstead of money we are sold too after we thought we had escaped  i\r\nwas beginning to feel fairly comfortable once more after my nights\r\nrest but the look of that envelope makes me sick  it isnt fat enough\r\n$ in even the largest banknotes makes more bulk than that\r\n\r\nedward why do you object to cheques\r\n\r\ncheques signed by stephenson  i am resigned to take the $ if it\r\ncould come in banknotesfor it does seem that it was so ordered\r\nmarybut i have never had much courage and i have not the pluck to try\r\nto market a cheque signed with that disastrous name  it would be a trap\r\nthat man tried to catch me we escaped somehow or other and now he is\r\ntrying a new way  if it is cheques\r\n\r\noh edward it is too bad  and she held up the cheques and began to\r\ncry\r\n\r\nput them in the fire quick we mustnt be tempted  it is a trick to\r\nmake the world laugh at us along with the rest andgive them to\r\nme since you cant do it  he snatched them and tried to hold his\r\ngrip till he could get to the stove but he was human he was a cashier\r\nand he stopped a moment to make sure of the signature  then he came near\r\nto fainting\r\n\r\nfan me mary fan me  they are the same as gold\r\n\r\noh how lovely edward  why\r\n\r\nsigned by harkness  what can the mystery of that be mary\r\n\r\nedward do you think\r\n\r\nlook herelook at this  fifteenfifteenfifteenthirtyfour  thirty\r\neight thousand five hundred  mary the sack isnt worth twelve dollars\r\nand harknessapparentlyhas paid about par for it\r\n\r\nand does it all come to us do you thinkinstead of the ten thousand\r\n\r\nwhy it looks like it  and the cheques are made to bearer too\r\n\r\nis that good edward  what is it for\r\n\r\na hint to collect them at some distant bank i reckon  perhaps harkness\r\ndoesnt want the matter known  what is thata note\r\n\r\nyes  it was with the cheques\r\n\r\nit was in the stephenson handwriting but there was no signature  it\r\nsaid\r\n\r\n   i am a disappointed man  your honesty is beyond the reach of\r\n   temptation  i had a different idea about it but i wronged you in\r\n   that and i beg pardon and do it sincerely  i honour youand that\r\n   is sincere too  this town is not worthy to kiss the hem of your\r\n   garment  dear sir i made a square bet with myself that there were\r\n   nineteen debauchable men in your selfrighteous community  i have\r\n   lost  take the whole pot you are entitled to it\r\n\r\nrichards drew a deep sigh and said\r\n\r\nit seems written with fireit burns so  maryi am miserable again\r\n\r\ni too  ah dear i wish\r\n\r\nto think maryhe believes in me\r\n\r\n\r\noh dont edwardi cant bear it\r\n\r\nif those beautiful words were deserved maryand god knows i believed i\r\ndeserved them oncei think i could give the forty thousand dollars for\r\nthem  and i would put that paper away as representing more than gold\r\nand jewels and keep it always  but nowwe could not live in the shadow\r\nof its accusing presence mary\r\n\r\nhe put it in the fire\r\n\r\na messenger arrived and delivered an envelope  richards took from it a\r\nnote and read it it was from burgess\r\n\r\n   you saved me in a difficult time  i saved you last night  it was\r\n   at cost of a lie but i made the sacrifice freely and out of a\r\n   grateful heart  none in this village knows so well as i know how\r\n   brave and good and noble you are  at bottom you cannot respect me\r\n   knowing as you do of that matter of which i am accused and by the\r\n   general voice condemned but i beg that you will at least believe that\r\n   i am a grateful man it will help me to bear my burden  signed\r\n   burgess\r\n\r\nsaved once more  and on such terms  he put the note in the lire\r\nii wish i were dead mary i wish i were out of it all\r\n\r\noh these are bitter bitter days edward  the stabs through their\r\nvery generosity are so deepand they come so fast\r\n\r\nthree days before the election each of two thousand voters suddenly found\r\nhimself in possession of a prized mementoone of the renowned bogus\r\ndoubleeagles  around one of its faces was stamped these words the\r\nremark i made to the poor stranger was  around the other face was\r\nstamped these go and reform  signed pinkerton  thus the entire\r\nremaining refuse of the renowned joke was emptied upon a single head and\r\nwith calamitous effect  it revived the recent vast laugh and\r\nconcentrated it upon pinkerton and harknesss election was a walkover\r\n\r\nwithin twentyfour hours after the richardses had received their cheques\r\ntheir consciences were quieting down discouraged the old couple were\r\nlearning to reconcile themselves to the sin which they had committed  but\r\nthey were to learn now that a sin takes on new and real terrors when\r\nthere seems a chance that it is going to be found out  this gives it a\r\nfresh and most substantial and important aspect  at church the morning\r\nsermon was of the usual pattern it was the same old things said in the\r\nsame old way they had heard them a thousand times and found them\r\ninnocuous next to meaningless and easy to sleep under but now it was\r\ndifferent the sermon seemed to bristle with accusations it seemed aimed\r\nstraight and specially at people who were concealing deadly sins  after\r\nchurch they got away from the mob of congratulators as soon as they\r\ncould and hurried homeward chilled to the bone at they did not know\r\nwhatvague shadowy indefinite fears  and by chance they caught a\r\nglimpse of mr burgess as he turned a corner  he paid no attention to\r\ntheir nod of recognition  he hadnt seen it but they did not know that\r\nwhat could his conduct mean  it might meanit mightmeanoh a dozen\r\ndreadful things  was it possible that he knew that richards could have\r\ncleared him of guilt in that bygone time and had been silently waiting\r\nfor a chance to even up accounts  at home in their distress they got to\r\nimagining that their servant might have been in the next room listening\r\nwhen richards revealed the secret to his wife that he knew of burgesss\r\ninnocence next richards began to imagine that he had heard the swish of\r\na gown in there at that time next he was sure he had heard it  they\r\nwould call sarah in on a pretext and watch her face if she had been\r\nbetraying them to mr burgess it would show in her manner  they asked\r\nher some questionsquestions which were so random and incoherent and\r\nseemingly purposeless that the girl felt sure that the old peoples minds\r\nhad been affected by their sudden good fortune the sharp and watchful\r\ngaze which they bent upon her frightened her and that completed the\r\nbusiness  she blushed she became nervous and confused and to the old\r\npeople these were plain signs of guiltguilt of some fearful sort or\r\notherwithout doubt she was a spy and a traitor  when they were alone\r\nagain they began to piece many unrelated things together and get horrible\r\nresults out of the combination  when things had got about to the worst\r\nrichards was delivered of a sudden gasp and his wife asked\r\n\r\noh what is itwhat is it\r\n\r\nthe noteburgesss note  its language was sarcastic i see it now  he\r\nquoted at bottom you cannot respect me knowing as you do of that\r\nmatter of which i am accusedoh it is perfectly plain now god help\r\nme  he knows that i know  you see the ingenuity of the phrasing  it\r\nwas a trapand like a fool i walked into it  and mary\r\n\r\noh it is dreadfuli know what you are going to sayhe didnt return\r\nyour transcript of the pretended testremark\r\n\r\nnokept it to destroy us with  mary he has exposed us to some\r\nalready  i know iti know it well  i saw it in a dozen faces after\r\nchurch  ah he wouldnt answer our nod of recognitionhe knew what he\r\nhad been doing\r\n\r\nin the night the doctor was called  the news went around in the morning\r\nthat the old couple were rather seriously illprostrated by the\r\nexhausting excitement growing out of their great windfall the\r\ncongratulations and the late hours the doctor said  the town was\r\nsincerely distressed for these old people were about all it had left to\r\nbe proud of now\r\n\r\ntwo days later the news was worse  the old couple were delirious and\r\nwere doing strange things  by witness of the nurses richards had\r\nexhibited chequesfor $  nofor an amazing sum$  what\r\ncould be the explanation of this gigantic piece of luck\r\n\r\nthe following day the nurses had more newsand wonderful  they had\r\nconcluded to hide the cheques lest harm come to them but when they\r\nsearched they were gone from under the patients pillowvanished away\r\nthe patient said\r\n\r\nlet the pillow alone what do you want\r\n\r\nwe thought it best that the cheques\r\n\r\nyou will never see them againthey are destroyed  they came from\r\nsatan  i saw the hellbrand on them and i knew they were sent to betray\r\nme to sin  then he fell to gabbling strange and dreadful things which\r\nwere not clearly understandable and which the doctor admonished them to\r\nkeep to themselves\r\n\r\nrichards was right the cheques were never seen again\r\n\r\na nurse must have talked in her sleep for within two days the forbidden\r\ngabblings were the property of the town and they were of a surprising\r\nsort  they seemed to indicate that richards had been a claimant for the\r\nsack himself and that burgess had concealed that fact and then\r\nmaliciously betrayed it\r\n\r\nburgess was taxed with this and stoutly denied it  and he said it was\r\nnot fair to attach weight to the chatter of a sick old man who was out of\r\nhis mind  still suspicion was in the air and there was much talk\r\n\r\nafter a day or two it was reported that mrs richardss delirious\r\ndeliveries were getting to be duplicates of her husbands  suspicion\r\nflamed up into conviction now and the towns pride in the purity of its\r\none undiscredited important citizen began to dim down and flicker toward\r\nextinction\r\n\r\nsix days passed then came more news  the old couple were dying\r\nrichardss mind cleared in his latest hour and he sent for burgess\r\nburgess said\r\n\r\nlet the room be cleared  i think he wishes to say something in\r\nprivacy\r\n\r\nno said richards i want witnesses  i want you all to hear my\r\nconfession so that i may die a man and not a dog  i was\r\ncleanartificiallylike the rest and like the rest i fell when\r\ntemptation came  i signed a lie and claimed the miserable sack  mr\r\nburgess remembered that i had done him a service and in gratitude and\r\nignorance he suppressed my claim and saved me  you know the thing that\r\nwas charged against burgess years ago  my testimony and mine alone\r\ncould have cleared him and i was a coward and left him to suffer\r\ndisgrace\r\n\r\nnonomr richards you\r\n\r\nmy servant betrayed my secret to him\r\n\r\nno one has betrayed anything to me\r\n\r\nand then he did a natural and justifiable thing he repented of the\r\nsaving kindness which he had done me and he exposed meas i\r\ndeserved\r\n\r\nneveri make oath\r\n\r\nout of my heart i forgive him\r\n\r\nburgesss impassioned protestations fell upon deaf ears the dying man\r\npassed away without knowing that once more he had done poor burgess a\r\nwrong  the old wife died that night\r\n\r\nthe last of the sacred nineteen had fallen a prey to the fiendish sack\r\nthe town was stripped of the last rag of its ancient glory  its mourning\r\nwas not showy but it was deep\r\n\r\nby act of the legislatureupon prayer and petitionhadleyburg was\r\nallowed to change its name to never mind whati will not give it away\r\nand leave one word out of the motto that for many generations had graced\r\nthe towns official seal\r\n\r\nit is an honest town once more and the man will have to rise early that\r\ncatches it napping
