A. P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEUREKA:\r\n\r\nAN ESSAY ON THE MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL UNIVERSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with humility really unassumed—it is with a sentiment even of\r\nawe—that I pen the opening sentence of this work: for of all conceivable\r\nsubjects I approach the reader with the most solemn—the most\r\ncomprehensive—the most difficult—the most august.\r\n\r\nWhat terms shall I find sufficiently simple in their\r\nsublimity—sufficiently sublime in their simplicity—for the mere\r\nenunciation of my theme?\r\n\r\nI design to speak of the _Physical, Metaphysical and Mathematical—of the\r\nMaterial and Spiritual Universe:—of its Essence, its Origin, its\r\nCreation, its Present Condition and its Destiny_. I shall be so rash,\r\nmoreover, as to challenge the conclusions, and thus, in effect, to\r\nquestion the sagacity, of many of the greatest and most justly\r\nreverenced of men.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, let me as distinctly as possible announce—not the\r\ntheorem which I hope to demonstrate—for, whatever the mathematicians may\r\nassert, there is, in this world at least, _no such thing_ as\r\ndemonstration—but the ruling idea which, throughout this volume, I shall\r\nbe continually endeavoring to suggest.\r\n\r\nMy general proposition, then, is this:—_In the Original Unity of the\r\nFirst Thing lies the Secondary Cause of All Things, with the Germ of\r\ntheir Inevitable Annihilation_.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this idea, I propose to take such a survey of the\r\nUniverse that the mind may be able really to receive and to perceive an\r\nindividual impression.\r\n\r\nHe who from the top of Ætna casts his eyes leisurely around, is affected\r\nchiefly by the _extent_ and _diversity_ of the scene. Only by a rapid\r\nwhirling on his heel could he hope to comprehend the panorama in the\r\nsublimity of its _oneness_. But as, on the summit of Ætna, _no_ man has\r\nthought of whirling on his heel, so no man has ever taken into his brain\r\nthe full uniqueness of the prospect; and so, again, whatever\r\nconsiderations lie involved in this uniqueness, have as yet no practical\r\nexistence for mankind.\r\n\r\nI do not know a treatise in which a survey of the _Universe_—using the\r\nword in its most comprehensive and only legitimate acceptation—is taken\r\nat all:—and it may be as well here to mention that by the term\r\n“Universe,” wherever employed without qualification in this essay, I\r\nmean to designate _the utmost conceivable expanse of space, with all\r\nthings, spiritual and material, that can be imagined to exist within the\r\ncompass of that expanse_. In speaking of what is ordinarily implied by\r\nthe expression, “Universe,” I shall take a phrase of limitation—“the\r\nUniverse of stars.” Why this distinction is considered necessary, will\r\nbe seen in the sequel.\r\n\r\nBut even of treatises on the really limited, although always assumed as\r\nthe _un_limited, Universe of _stars_, I know none in which a survey,\r\neven of this limited Universe, is so taken as to warrant deductions from\r\nits _individuality_. The nearest approach to such a work is made in the\r\n“Cosmos” of Alexander Von Humboldt. He presents the subject, however,\r\n_not_ in its individuality but in its generality. His theme, in its last\r\nresult, is the law of _each_ portion of the merely physical Universe, as\r\nthis law is related to the laws of _every other_ portion of this merely\r\nphysical Universe. His design is simply synœretical. In a word, he\r\ndiscusses the universality of material relation, and discloses to the\r\neye of Philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden _behind_\r\nthis universality. But however admirable be the succinctness with which\r\nhe has treated each particular point of his topic, the mere multiplicity\r\nof these points occasions, necessarily, an amount of detail, and thus an\r\ninvolution of idea, which precludes all _individuality_ of impression.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that, in aiming at this latter effect, and, through it,\r\nat the consequences—the conclusions—the suggestions—the speculations—or,\r\nif nothing better offer itself the mere guesses which may result from\r\nit—we require something like a mental gyration on the heel. We need so\r\nrapid a revolution of all things about the central point of sight that,\r\nwhile the minutiæ vanish altogether, even the more conspicuous objects\r\nbecome blended into one. Among the vanishing minutiæ, in a survey of\r\nthis kind, would be all exclusively terrestrial matters. The Earth would\r\nbe considered in its planetary relations alone. A man, in this view,\r\nbecomes mankind; mankind a member of the cosmical family of\r\nIntelligences.\r\n\r\nAnd now, before proceeding to our subject proper, let me beg the\r\nreader’s attention to an extract or two from a somewhat remarkable\r\nletter, which appears to have been found corked in a bottle and floating\r\non the _Mare Tenebrarum_—an ocean well described by the Nubian\r\ngeographer, Ptolemy Hephestion, but little frequented in modern days\r\nunless by the Transcendentalists and some other divers for crotchets.\r\nThe date of this letter, I confess, surprises me even more particularly\r\nthan its contents; for it seems to have been written in the year _two_\r\nthousand eight hundred and forty-eight. As for the passages I am about\r\nto transcribe, they, I fancy, will speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, my dear friend,” says the writer, addressing, no doubt, a\r\ncontemporary—“Do you know that it is scarcely more than eight or nine\r\nhundred years ago since the metaphysicians first consented to relieve\r\nthe people of the singular fancy that there exist _but two practicable\r\nroads to Truth_? Believe it if you can! It appears, however, that long,\r\nlong ago, in the night of Time, there lived a Turkish philosopher called\r\nAries and surnamed Tottle.” [Here, possibly, the letter-writer means\r\nAristotle; the best names are wretchedly corrupted in two or three\r\nthousand years.] “The fame of this great man depended mainly upon his\r\ndemonstration that sneezing is a natural provision, by means of which\r\nover-profound thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous ideas through\r\nthe nose; but he obtained a scarcely less valuable celebrity as the\r\nfounder, or at all events as the principal propagator, of what was\r\ntermed the _de_ductive or _à priori_ philosophy. He started with what he\r\nmaintained to be axioms, or self-evident truths:—and the now well\r\nunderstood fact that _no_ truths are _self_-evident, really does not\r\nmake in the slightest degree against his speculations:—it was sufficient\r\nfor his purpose that the truths in question were evident at all. From\r\naxioms he proceeded, logically, to results. His most illustrious\r\ndisciples were one Tuclid, a geometrician,” [meaning Euclid] “and one\r\nKant, a Dutchman, the originator of that species of Transcendentalism\r\nwhich, with the change merely of a C for a K, now bears his peculiar\r\nname.\r\n\r\n“Well, Aries Tottle flourished supreme, until the advent of one Hog,\r\nsurnamed ‘the Ettrick shepherd,’ who preached an entirely different\r\nsystem, which he called the _à posteriori_ or _in_ductive. His plan\r\nreferred altogether to sensation. He proceeded by observing, analyzing,\r\nand classifying facts—_instantiæ Naturæ_, as they were somewhat\r\naffectedly called—and arranging them into general laws. In a word, while\r\nthe mode of Aries rested on _noumena_, that of Hog depended on\r\n_phenomena_; and so great was the admiration excited by this latter\r\nsystem that, at its first introduction, Aries fell into general\r\ndisrepute. Finally, however, he recovered ground, and was permitted to\r\ndivide the empire of Philosophy with his more modern rival:—the savans\r\ncontenting themselves with proscribing all _other_ competitors, past,\r\npresent, and to come; putting an end to all controversy on the topic by\r\nthe promulgation of a Median law, to the effect that the Aristotelian\r\nand Baconian roads are, and of right ought to be, the solo possible\r\navenues to knowledge:—‘Baconian,’ you must know, my dear friend,” adds\r\nthe letter-writer at this point, “was an adjective invented as\r\nequivalent to Hog-ian, and at the same time more dignified and\r\neuphonious.\r\n\r\n“Now I do assure you most positively”—proceeds the epistle—“that I\r\nrepresent these matters fairly; and you can easily understand how\r\nrestrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated, in those\r\ndays, to retard the progress of true Science, which makes its most\r\nimportant advances—as all History will show—by seemingly intuitive\r\n_leaps_. These ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling; and I\r\nneed not suggest to you that crawling, among varieties of locomotion, is\r\na very capital thing of its kind;—but because the tortoise is sure of\r\nfoot, for this reason must we clip the wings of the eagles? For many\r\ncenturies, so great was the infatuation, about Hog especially, that a\r\nvirtual stop was put to all thinking, properly so called. No man dared\r\nutter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone. It\r\nmattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably such; for the\r\ndogmatizing philosophers of that epoch regarded only _the road_ by which\r\nit professed to have been attained. The end, with them, was a point of\r\nno moment, whatever:—‘the means!’ they vociferated—‘let us look at the\r\nmeans!’—and if, on scrutiny of the means, it was found to come neither\r\nunder the category Hog, nor under the category Aries (which means ram),\r\nwhy then the savans went no farther, but, calling the thinker a fool\r\nand branding him a ‘theorist,’ would never, thenceforward, have any\r\nthing to do either with _him_ or with his truths.\r\n\r\n“Now, my dear friend,” continues the letter-writer, “it cannot be\r\nmaintained that by the crawling system, exclusively adopted, men would\r\narrive at the maximum amount of truth, even in any long series of ages;\r\nfor the repression of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced\r\neven by _absolute_ certainty in the snail processes. But their certainty\r\nwas very far from absolute. The error of our progenitors was quite\r\nanalogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies he must necessarily see\r\nan object the more distinctly, the more closely he holds it to his eyes.\r\nThey blinded themselves, too, with the impalpable, titillating Scotch\r\nsnuff of _detail_; and thus the boasted facts of the Hog-ites were by no\r\nmeans always facts—a point of little importance but for the assumption\r\nthat they always _were_. The vital taint, however, in Baconianism—its\r\nmost lamentable fount of error—lay in its tendency to throw power and\r\nconsideration into the hands of merely perceptive men—of those\r\ninter-Tritonic minnows, the microscopical savans—the diggers and pedlers\r\nof minute _facts_, for the most part in physical science—facts all of\r\nwhich they retailed at the same price upon the highway; their value\r\ndepending, it was supposed, simply upon the _fact of their fact_,\r\nwithout reference to their applicability or inapplicability in the\r\ndevelopment of those ultimate and only legitimate facts, called Law.\r\n\r\n“Than the persons”—the letter goes on to say—“Than the persons thus\r\nsuddenly elevated by the Hog-ian philosophy into a station for which\r\nthey were unfitted—thus transferred from the sculleries into the parlors\r\nof Science—from its pantries into its pulpits—than these individuals a\r\nmore intolerant—a more intolerable set of bigots and tyrants never\r\nexisted on the face of the earth. Their creed, their text and their\r\nsermon were, alike, the one word ‘_fact_’—but, for the most part, even\r\nof this one word, they knew not even the meaning. On those who ventured\r\nto _disturb_ their facts with the view of putting them in order and to\r\nuse, the disciples of Hog had no mercy whatever. All attempts at\r\ngeneralization were met at once by the words ‘theoretical,’ ‘theory,’\r\n‘theorist’—all _thought_, to be brief, was very properly resented as a\r\npersonal affront to themselves. Cultivating the natural sciences to the\r\nexclusion of Metaphysics, the Mathematics, and Logic, many of these\r\nBacon-engendered philosophers—one-idead, one-sided and lame of a\r\nleg—were more wretchedly helpless—more miserably ignorant, in view of\r\nall the comprehensible objects of knowledge, than the veriest unlettered\r\nhind who proves that he knows something at least, in admitting that he\r\nknows absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\n“Nor had our forefathers any better right to talk about _certainty_,\r\nwhen pursuing, in blind confidence, the _à priori_ path of axioms, or of\r\nthe Ram. At innumerable points this path was scarcely as straight as a\r\nram’s-horn. The simple truth is, that the Aristotelians erected their\r\ncastles upon a basis far less reliable than air; _for no such things as\r\naxioms ever existed or can possibly exist at all_. This they must have\r\nbeen very blind, indeed, not to see, or at least to suspect; for, even\r\nin their own day, many of their long-admitted ‘axioms’ had been\r\nabandoned:—‘_ex nihilo nihil fit_,’ for example, and a ‘thing cannot act\r\nwhere it is not,’ and ‘there cannot be antipodes,’ and ‘darkness cannot\r\nproceed from light.’ These and numerous similar propositions formerly\r\naccepted, without hesitation, as axioms, or undeniable truths, were,\r\neven at the period of which I speak, seen to be altogether\r\nuntenable:—how absurd in these people, then, to persist in relying upon\r\na basis, as immutable, whose mutability had become so repeatedly\r\nmanifest!\r\n\r\n“But, even through evidence afforded by themselves against themselves,\r\nit is easy to convict these _à priori_ reasoners of the grossest\r\nunreason—it is easy to show the futility—the impalpability of their\r\naxioms in general. I have now lying before me”—it will be observed that\r\nwe still proceed with the letter—“I have now lying before me a book\r\nprinted about a thousand years ago. Pundit assures me that it is\r\ndecidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, which is ‘Logic.’ The\r\nauthor, who was much esteemed in his day, was one Miller, or Mill; and\r\nwe find it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he rode\r\na mill-horse whom he called Jeremy Bentham:—but let us glance at the\r\nvolume itself!\r\n\r\n“Ah!—‘Ability or inability to conceive,’ says Mr. Mill very properly,\r\n‘is _in no case_ to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth.’ Now,\r\nthat this is a palpable truism no one in his senses will deny. _Not_ to\r\nadmit the proposition, is to insinuate a charge of variability in Truth\r\nitself, whose very title is a synonym of the Steadfast. If ability to\r\nconceive be taken as a criterion of Truth, then a truth to _David_ Hume\r\nwould very seldom be a truth to _Joe_; and ninety-nine hundredths of\r\nwhat is undeniable in Heaven would be demonstrable falsity upon Earth.\r\nThe proposition of Mr. Mill, then, is sustained. I will not grant it to\r\nbe an _axiom_; and this merely because I am showing that _no_ axioms\r\nexist; but, with a distinction which could not have been cavilled at\r\neven by Mr. Mill himself, I am ready to grant that, _if_ an axiom _there\r\nbe_, then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be\r\nconsidered an axiom—that no _more_ absolute axiom _is_—and,\r\nconsequently, that any subsequent proposition which shall conflict with\r\nthis one primarily advanced, must be either a falsity in itself—that is\r\nto say no axiom—or, if admitted axiomatic, must at once neutralize both\r\nitself and its predecessor.\r\n\r\n“And now, by the logic of their own propounder, let us proceed to test\r\nany one of the axioms propounded. Let us give Mr. Mill the fairest of\r\nplay. We will bring the point to no ordinary issue. We will select for\r\ninvestigation no common-place axiom—no axiom of what, not the less\r\npreposterously because only impliedly, he terms his secondary class—as\r\nif a positive truth by definition could be either more or less\r\npositively a truth:—we will select, I say, no axiom of an\r\nunquestionability so questionable as is to be found in Euclid. We will\r\nnot talk, for example, about such propositions as that two straight\r\nlines cannot enclose a space, or that the whole is greater than any one\r\nof its parts. We will afford the logician _every_ advantage. We will\r\ncome at once to a proposition which he regards as the acme of the\r\nunquestionable—as the quintessence of axiomatic undeniability. Here it\r\nis:—‘Contradictions cannot _both_ be true—that is, cannot cöexist in\r\nnature.’ Here Mr. Mill means, for instance,—and I give the most forcible\r\ninstance conceivable—that a tree must be either a tree or _not_ a\r\ntree—that it cannot be at the same time a tree _and_ not a tree:—all\r\nwhich is quite reasonable of itself and will answer remarkably well as\r\nan axiom, until we bring it into collation with an axiom insisted upon a\r\nfew pages before—in other words—words which I have previously\r\nemployed—until we test it by the logic of its own propounder. ‘A tree,’\r\nMr. Mill asserts, ‘must be either a tree or _not_ a tree.’ Very\r\nwell:—and now let me ask him, _why_. To this little query there is but\r\none response:—I defy any man living to invent a second. The sole answer\r\nis this:—‘Because we find it _impossible to conceive_ that a tree can be\r\nany thing else than a tree or not a tree.’ This, I repeat, is Mr. Mill’s\r\nsole answer:—he will not _pretend_ to suggest another:—and yet, by his\r\nown showing, his answer is clearly no answer at all; for has he not\r\nalready required us to admit, _as an axiom_, that ability or inability\r\nto conceive is _in no case_ to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic\r\ntruth? Thus all—absolutely _all_ his argumentation is at sea without a\r\nrudder. Let it not be urged that an exception from the general rule is\r\nto be made, in cases where the ‘impossibility to conceive’ is so\r\npeculiarly great as when we are called upon to conceive a tree _both_ a\r\ntree and _not_ a tree. Let no attempt, I say, be made at urging this\r\nsotticism; for, in the first place, there are no _degrees_ of\r\n‘impossibility,’ and thus no one impossible conception can be _more_\r\npeculiarly impossible than another impossible conception:—in the second\r\nplace, Mr. Mill himself, no doubt after thorough deliberation, has most\r\ndistinctly, and most rationally, excluded all opportunity for exception,\r\nby the emphasis of his proposition, that, _in no case_, is ability or\r\ninability to conceive, to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic\r\ntruth:—in the third place, even were exceptions admissible at all, it\r\nremains to be shown how any exception is admissible _here_. That a tree\r\ncan be both a tree and not a tree, is an idea which the angels, or the\r\ndevils, _may_ entertain, and which no doubt many an earthly Bedlamite,\r\nor Transcendentalist, _does_.\r\n\r\n“Now I do not quarrel with these ancients,” continues the letter-writer,\r\n“_so much_ on account of the transparent frivolity of their logic—which,\r\nto be plain, was baseless, worthless and fantastic altogether—as on\r\naccount of their pompous and infatuate proscription of all _other_ roads\r\nto Truth than the two narrow and crooked paths—the one of creeping and\r\nthe other of crawling—to which, in their ignorant perversity, they have\r\ndared to confine the Soul—the Soul which loves nothing so well as to\r\nsoar in those regions of illimitable intuition which are utterly\r\nincognizant of ‘_path_.’\r\n\r\n“By the bye, my dear friend, is it not an evidence of the mental slavery\r\nentailed upon those bigoted people by their Hogs and Rams, that in spite\r\nof the eternal prating of their savans about _roads_ to Truth, none of\r\nthem fell, even by accident, into what we now so distinctly perceive to\r\nbe the broadest, the straightest and most available of all mere\r\nroads—the great thoroughfare—the majestic highway of the _Consistent_?\r\nIs it not wonderful that they should have failed to deduce from the\r\nworks of God the vitally momentous consideration that _a perfect\r\nconsistency can be nothing but an absolute truth_? How plain—how rapid\r\nour progress since the late announcement of this proposition! By its\r\nmeans, investigation has been taken out of the hands of the ground-moles,\r\nand given as a duty, rather than as a task, to the true—to the _only_ true\r\nthinkers—to the generally-educated men of ardent imagination. These\r\nlatter—our Keplers—our Laplaces—‘speculate’—‘theorize’—these are the\r\nterms—can you not fancy the shout of scorn with which they would be\r\nreceived by our progenitors, were it possible for them to be looking\r\nover my shoulders as I write? The Keplers, I repeat, speculate—theorize—and\r\ntheir theories are merely corrected—reduced—sifted—cleared, little by\r\nlittle, of their chaff of inconsistency—until at length there stands\r\napparent an unencumbered _Consistency_—a consistency which the most\r\nstolid admit—because it _is_ a consistency—to be an absolute and an\r\nunquestionable _Truth_.\r\n\r\n“I have often thought, my friend, that it must have puzzled these\r\ndogmaticians of a thousand years ago, to determine, even, by which of\r\ntheir two boasted roads it is that the cryptographist attains the\r\nsolution of the more complicate cyphers—or by which of them Champollion\r\nguided mankind to those important and innumerable truths which, for so\r\nmany centuries, have lain entombed amid the phonetical hieroglyphics of\r\nEgypt. In especial, would it not have given these bigots some trouble to\r\ndetermine by which of their two roads was reached the most momentous and\r\nsublime of _all_ their truths—the truth—the fact of _gravitation_?\r\nNewton deduced it from the laws of Kepler. Kepler admitted that these\r\nlaws he _guessed_—these laws whose investigation disclosed to the\r\ngreatest of British astronomers that principle, the basis of all\r\n(existing) physical principle, in going behind which we enter at once\r\nthe nebulous kingdom of Metaphysics. Yes!—these vital laws Kepler\r\n_guessed_—that is to say, he _imagined_ them. Had he been asked to point\r\nout either the _de_ductive or _in_ductive route by which he attained\r\nthem, his reply might have been—‘I know nothing about _routes_—but I\r\n_do_ know the machinery of the Universe. Here it is. I grasped it with\r\n_my soul_—I reached it through mere dint of _intuition_.’ Alas, poor\r\nignorant old man! Could not any metaphysician have told him that what he\r\ncalled ‘intuition’ was but the conviction resulting from _de_ductions or\r\n_in_ductions of which the processes were so shadowy as to have escaped\r\nhis consciousness, eluded his reason, or bidden defiance to his capacity\r\nof expression? How great a pity it is that some ‘moral philosopher’ had\r\nnot enlightened him about all this! How it would have comforted him on\r\nhis death-bed to know that, instead of having gone intuitively and thus\r\nunbecomingly, he had, in fact, proceeded decorously and\r\nlegitimately—that is to say Hog-ishly, or at least Ram-ishly—into the\r\nvast halls where lay gleaming, untended, and hitherto untouched by\r\nmortal hand—unseen by mortal eye—the imperishable and priceless secrets\r\nof the Universe!\r\n\r\n“Yes, Kepler was essentially a _theorist_; but this title, _now_ of so\r\nmuch sanctity, was, in those ancient days, a designation of supreme\r\ncontempt. It is only _now_ that men begin to appreciate that divine old\r\nman—to sympathize with the prophetical and poetical rhapsody of his\r\never-memorable words. For _my_ part,” continues the unknown\r\ncorrespondent, “I glow with a sacred fire when I even think of them, and\r\nfeel that I shall never grow weary of their repetition:—in concluding\r\nthis letter, let me have the real pleasure of transcribing them once\r\nagain:—‘_I care not whether my work be read now or by posterity. I can\r\nafford to wait a century for readers when God himself has waited six\r\nthousand years for an observer. I triumph. I have stolen the golden\r\nsecret of the Egyptians. I will indulge my sacred fury._’”\r\n\r\nHere end my quotations from this very unaccountable and, perhaps,\r\nsomewhat impertinent epistle; and perhaps it would be folly to comment,\r\nin any respect, upon the chimerical, not to say revolutionary, fancies\r\nof the writer—whoever he is—fancies so radically at war with the\r\nwell-considered and well-settled opinions of this age. Let us proceed,\r\nthen, to our legitimate thesis, _The Universe_.\r\n\r\nThis thesis admits a choice between two modes of discussion:—We may\r\n_as_cend or _de_scend. Beginning at our own point of view—at the Earth\r\non which we stand—we may pass to the other planets of our system—thence\r\nto the Sun—thence to our system considered collectively—and thence,\r\nthrough other systems, indefinitely outwards; or, commencing on high at\r\nsome point as definite as we can make it or conceive it, we may come\r\ndown to the habitation of Man. Usually—that is to say, in ordinary\r\nessays on Astronomy—the first of these two modes is, with certain\r\nreservation, adopted:—this for the obvious reason that astronomical\r\n_facts_, merely, and principles, being the object, that object is best\r\nfulfilled in stepping from the known because proximate, gradually onward\r\nto the point where all certitude becomes lost in the remote. For my\r\npresent purpose, however,—that of enabling the mind to take in, as if\r\nfrom afar and at one glance, a distinct conception of the _individual_\r\nUniverse—it is clear that a descent to small from great—to the outskirts\r\nfrom the centre (if we could establish a centre)—to the end from the\r\nbeginning (if we could fancy a beginning) would be the preferable\r\ncourse, but for the difficulty, if not impossibility, of presenting, in\r\nthis course, to the unastronomical, a picture at all comprehensible in\r\nregard to such considerations as are involved in _quantity_—that is to\r\nsay, in number, magnitude and distance.\r\n\r\nNow, distinctness—intelligibility, at all points, is a primary feature\r\nin my general design. On important topics it is better to be a good deal\r\nprolix than even a very little obscure. But abstruseness is a quality\r\nappertaining to no subject _per se_. All are alike, in facility of\r\ncomprehension, to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps.\r\nIt is merely because a stepping-stone, here and there, is heedlessly\r\nleft unsupplied in our road to the Differential Calculus, that this\r\nlatter is not altogether as simple a thing as a sonnet by Mr. Solomon\r\nSeesaw.\r\n\r\nBy way of admitting, then, no _chance_ for misapprehension, I think it\r\nadvisable to proceed as if even the more obvious facts of Astronomy were\r\nunknown to the reader. In combining the two modes of discussion to which\r\nI have referred, I propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar to\r\neach—and very especially of the _iteration in detail_ which will be\r\nunavoidable as a consequence of the plan. Commencing with a descent, I\r\nshall reserve for the return upwards those indispensable considerations\r\nof _quantity_ to which allusion has already been made.\r\n\r\nLet us begin, then, at once, with that merest of words, “Infinity.”\r\nThis, like “God,” “spirit,” and some other expressions of which the\r\nequivalents exist in all languages, is by no means the expression of an\r\nidea—but of an effort at one. It stands for the possible attempt at an\r\nimpossible conception. Man needed a term by which to point out the\r\n_direction_ of this effort—the cloud behind which lay, forever\r\ninvisible, the _object_ of this attempt. A word, in fine, was demanded,\r\nby means of which one human being might put himself in relation at once\r\nwith another human being and with a certain _tendency_ of the human\r\nintellect. Out of this demand arose the word, “Infinity;” which is thus\r\nthe representative but of the _thought of a thought_.\r\n\r\nAs regards _that_ infinity now considered—the infinity of space—we often\r\nhear it said that “its idea is admitted by the mind—is acquiesced in—is\r\nentertained—on account of the greater difficulty which attends the\r\nconception of a limit.” But this is merely one of those _phrases_ by\r\nwhich even profound thinkers, time out of mind, have occasionally taken\r\npleasure in deceiving _themselves_. The quibble lies concealed in the\r\nword “difficulty.” “The mind,” we are told, “entertains the idea of\r\n_limitless_, through the greater _difficulty_ which it finds in\r\nentertaining that of _limited_, space.” Now, were the proposition but\r\nfairly _put_, its absurdity would become transparent at once. Clearly,\r\nthere is no mere _difficulty_ in the case. The assertion intended, if\r\npresented _according_ to its intention and without sophistry, would run\r\nthus:—“The mind admits the idea of limitless, through the greater\r\n_impossibility_ of entertaining that of limited, space.”\r\n\r\nIt must be immediately seen that this is not a question of two\r\nstatements between whose respective credibilities—or of two arguments\r\nbetween whose respective validities—the _reason_ is called upon to\r\ndecide:—it is a matter of two conceptions, directly conflicting, and\r\neach avowedly impossible, one of which the _intellect_ is supposed to be\r\ncapable of entertaining, on account of the greater _impossibility_ of\r\nentertaining the other. The choice is _not_ made between two\r\ndifficulties;—it is merely _fancied_ to be made between two\r\nimpossibilities. Now of the former, there _are_ degrees—but of the\r\nlatter, none:—just as our impertinent letter-writer has already\r\nsuggested. A task _may_ be more or less difficult; but it is either\r\npossible or not possible:—there are no gradations. It _might_ be more\r\n_difficult_ to overthrow the Andes than an ant-hill; but it _can_ be no\r\nmore _impossible_ to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of\r\nthe other. A man may jump ten feet with less _difficulty_ than he can\r\njump twenty, but the _impossibility_ of his leaping to the moon is not a\r\nwhit less than that of his leaping to the dog-star.\r\n\r\nSince all this is undeniable: since the choice of the mind is to be made\r\nbetween _impossibilities_ of conception: since one impossibility cannot\r\nbe greater than another: and since, thus, one cannot be preferred to\r\nanother: the philosophers who not only maintain, on the grounds\r\nmentioned, man’s _idea_ of infinity but, on account of such\r\nsupposititious idea, _infinity itself_—are plainly engaged in\r\ndemonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is\r\nthat some one other thing—is impossible too. This, it will be said, is\r\nnonsense; and perhaps it is:—indeed I think it very capital\r\nnonsense—but forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine.\r\n\r\nThe readiest mode, however, of displaying the fallacy of the\r\nphilosophical argument on this question, is by simply adverting to a\r\n_fact_ respecting it which has been hitherto quite overlooked—the fact\r\nthat the argument alluded to both proves and disproves its own\r\nproposition. “The mind is impelled,” say the theologians and others, “to\r\nadmit a _First Cause_, by the superior difficulty it experiences in\r\nconceiving cause beyond cause without end.” The quibble, as before, lies\r\nin the word “difficulty”—but _here_ what is it employed to sustain? A\r\nFirst Cause. And what is a First Cause? An ultimate termination of\r\ncauses. And what is an ultimate termination of causes? Finity—the\r\nFinite. Thus the one quibble, in two processes, by God knows how many\r\nphilosophers, is made to support now Finity and now Infinity—could it\r\nnot be brought to support something besides? As for the\r\nquibblers—_they_, at least, are insupportable. But—to dismiss them:—what\r\nthey prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they\r\ndemonstrate in the other.\r\n\r\nOf course, no one will suppose that I here contend for the absolute\r\nimpossibility of _that_ which we attempt to convey in the word\r\n“Infinity.” My purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove\r\nInfinity itself or even our conception of it, by any such blundering\r\nratiocination as that which is ordinarily employed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as an individual, I may be permitted to say that _I\r\ncannot_ conceive Infinity, and am convinced that no human being can. A\r\nmind not thoroughly self-conscious—not accustomed to the introspective\r\nanalysis of its own operations—will, it is true, often deceive itself by\r\nsupposing that it _has_ entertained the conception of which we speak. In\r\nthe effort to entertain it, we proceed step beyond step—we fancy point\r\nstill beyond point; and so long as we _continue_ the effort, it may be\r\nsaid, in fact, that we are _tending_ to the formation of the idea\r\ndesigned; while the strength of the impression that we actually form or\r\nhave formed it, is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up\r\nthe mental endeavor. But it is in the act of discontinuing the\r\nendeavor—of fulfilling (as we think) the idea—of putting the finishing\r\nstroke (as we suppose) to the conception—that we overthrow at once the\r\nwhole fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and\r\ntherefore definite point. This fact, however, we fail to perceive, on\r\naccount of the absolute coincidence, in time, between the settling down\r\nupon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in thinking.—In\r\nattempting, on the other hand, to frame the idea of a _limited_ space,\r\nwe merely converse the processes which involve the impossibility.\r\n\r\nWe _believe_ in a God. We may or may not _believe_ in finite or in\r\ninfinite space; but our belief, in such cases, is more properly\r\ndesignated as _faith_, and is a matter quite distinct from that belief\r\nproper—from that _intellectual_ belief—which presupposes the mental\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that, upon the enunciation of any one of that class of\r\nterms to which “Infinity” belongs—the class representing _thoughts of\r\nthought_—he who has a right to say that he thinks _at all_, feels\r\nhimself called upon, _not_ to entertain a conception, but simply to\r\ndirect his mental vision toward some given point, in the intellectual\r\nfirmament, where lies a nebula never to be resolved. To solve it,\r\nindeed, he makes no effort; for with a rapid instinct he comprehends,\r\nnot only the impossibility, but, as regards all human purposes, the\r\n_inessentiality_, of its solution. He perceives that the Deity has not\r\n_designed_ it to be solved. He sees, at once, that it lies _out_ of the\r\nbrain of man, and even _how_, if not exactly _why_, it lies out of it.\r\nThere _are_ people, I am aware, who, busying themselves in attempts at\r\nthe unattainable, acquire very easily, by dint of the jargon they emit,\r\namong those thinkers-that-they-think with whom darkness and depth are\r\nsynonymous, a kind of cuttle-fish reputation for profundity; but the\r\nfinest quality of Thought is its self-cognizance; and, with some little\r\nequivocation, it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater\r\nthan that which, extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain,\r\nshuts out even these boundaries themselves from comprehension.\r\n\r\nIt will now be understood that, in using the phrase, “Infinity of\r\nSpace,” I make no call upon the reader to entertain the impossible\r\nconception of an _absolute_ infinity. I refer simply to the “_utmost\r\nconceivable expanse_” of space—a shadowy and fluctuating domain, now\r\nshrinking, now swelling, in accordance with the vacillating energies of\r\nthe imagination.\r\n\r\n_Hitherto_, the Universe of stars has always been considered as\r\ncoincident with the Universe proper, as I have defined it in the\r\ncommencement of this Discourse. It has been always either directly or\r\nindirectly assumed—at least since the dawn of intelligible\r\nAstronomy—that, were it possible for us to attain any given point in\r\nspace, we should still find, on all sides of us, an interminable\r\nsuccession of stars. This was the untenable idea of Pascal when making\r\nperhaps the most successful attempt ever made, at periphrasing the\r\nconception for which we struggle in the word “Universe.” “It is a\r\nsphere,” he says, “of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference,\r\nnowhere.” But although this intended definition is, in fact, _no_\r\ndefinition of the Universe of _stars_, we may accept it, with some\r\nmental reservation, as a definition (rigorous enough for all practical\r\npurposes) of the Universe _proper_—that is to say, of the Universe of\r\n_space_. This latter, then, let us regard as “_a sphere of which the\r\ncentre is everywhere, the circumference nowhere_.” In fact, while we\r\nfind it impossible to fancy an _end_ to space, we have no difficulty in\r\npicturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of _beginnings_.\r\n\r\nAs our starting-point, then, let us adopt the _Godhead_. Of this\r\nGodhead, _in itself_, he alone is not imbecile—he alone is not impious\r\nwho propounds—nothing. “_Nous ne connaissons rien_,” says the Baron de\r\nBielfeld—“_Nous ne connaissons rien de la nature ou de l’essence de\r\nDieu:—pour savoir ce qu’il est, il faut être Dieu même._”—“We know\r\nabsolutely _nothing_ of the nature or essence of God:—in order to\r\ncomprehend what he is, we should have to be God ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“_We should have to be God ourselves!_”—With a phrase so startling as\r\nthis yet ringing in my ears, I nevertheless venture to demand if this\r\nour present ignorance of the Deity is an ignorance to which the soul is\r\n_everlastingly_ condemned.\r\n\r\nBy _Him_, however—_now_, at least, the Incomprehensible—by Him—assuming\r\nhim as _Spirit_—that is to say, as _not Matter_—a distinction which, for\r\nall intelligible purposes, will stand well instead of a definition—by\r\nHim, then, existing as Spirit, let us content ourselves, to-night, with\r\nsupposing to have been _created_, or made out of Nothing, by dint of his\r\nVolition—at some point of Space which we will take as a centre—at some\r\nperiod into which we do not pretend to inquire, but at all events\r\nimmensely remote—by Him, then again, let us suppose to have been\r\ncreated——_what_? This is a vitally momentous epoch in our\r\nconsiderations. _What_ is it that we are justified—that alone we are\r\njustified in supposing to have been, primarily and solely, _created_?\r\n\r\nWe have attained a point where only _Intuition_ can aid us:—but now let\r\nme recur to the idea which I have already suggested as that alone which\r\nwe can properly entertain of intuition. It is but _the conviction\r\narising from those inductions or deductions of which the processes are\r\nso shadowy as to escape our consciousness, elude our reason, or defy our\r\ncapacity of expression_. With this understanding, I now assert—that an\r\nintuition altogether irresistible, although inexpressible, forces me to\r\nthe conclusion that what God originally created—that that Matter which,\r\nby dint of his Volition, he first made from his Spirit, or from\r\nNihility, _could_ have been nothing but Matter in its utmost conceivable\r\nstate of——what?—of _Simplicity_?\r\n\r\nThis will be found the sole absolute _assumption_ of my Discourse. I use\r\nthe word “assumption” in its ordinary sense; yet I maintain that even\r\nthis my primary proposition, is very, very far indeed, from being really\r\na mere assumption. Nothing was ever more certainly—no human conclusion\r\nwas ever, in fact, more regularly—more rigorously _de_duced:—but, alas!\r\nthe processes lie out of the human analysis—at all events are beyond the\r\nutterance of the human tongue.\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavor to conceive what Matter must be, when, or if, in its\r\nabsolute extreme of _Simplicity_. Here the Reason flies at once to\r\nImparticularity—to a particle—to _one_ particle—a particle of _one_\r\nkind—of _one_ character—of _one_ nature—of _one size_—of one form—a\r\nparticle, therefore, “_without_ form and void”—a particle positively a\r\nparticle at all points—a particle absolutely unique, individual,\r\nundivided, and not indivisible only because He who _created_ it, by dint\r\nof his Will, can by an infinitely less energetic exercise of the same\r\nWill, as a matter of course, divide it.\r\n\r\n_Oneness_, then, is all that I predicate of the originally created\r\nMatter; but I propose to show that this _Oneness is a principle\r\nabundantly sufficient to account for the constitution, the existing\r\nphænomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the\r\nmaterial Universe_.\r\n\r\nThe willing into being the primordial particle, has completed the act,\r\nor more properly the _conception_, of Creation. We now proceed to the\r\nultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the Particle created—that\r\nis to say, the ultimate purpose so far as our considerations _yet_\r\nenable us to see it—the constitution of the Universe from it, the\r\nParticle.\r\n\r\nThis constitution has been effected by _forcing_ the originally and\r\ntherefore normally _One_ into the abnormal condition of _Many_. An\r\naction of this character implies rëaction. A diffusion from Unity, under\r\nthe conditions, involves a tendency to return into Unity—a tendency\r\nineradicable until satisfied. But on these points I will speak more\r\nfully hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe assumption of absolute Unity in the primordial Particle includes\r\nthat of infinite divisibility. Let us conceive the Particle, then, to be\r\nonly not totally exhausted by diffusion into Space. From the one\r\nParticle, as a centre, let us suppose to be irradiated spherically—in\r\nall directions—to immeasurable but still to definite distances in the\r\npreviously vacant space—a certain inexpressibly great yet limited number\r\nof unimaginably yet not infinitely minute atoms.\r\n\r\nNow, of these atoms, thus diffused, or upon diffusion, what conditions\r\nare we permitted—not to assume, but to infer, from consideration as well\r\nof their source as of the character of the design apparent in their\r\ndiffusion? _Unity_ being their source, and _difference from Unity_ the\r\ncharacter of the design manifested in their diffusion, we are warranted\r\nin supposing this character to be at least _generally_ preserved\r\nthroughout the design, and to form a portion of the design itself:—that\r\nis to say, we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at\r\nall points from the uniquity and simplicity of the origin. But, for\r\nthese reasons, shall we be justified in imagining the atoms\r\nheterogeneous, dissimilar, unequal, and inequidistant? More\r\nexplicitly—are we to consider no two atoms as, at their diffusion, of\r\nthe same nature, or of the same form, or of the same size?—and, after\r\nfulfilment of their diffusion into Space, is absolute inequidistance,\r\neach from each, to be understood of all of them? In such arrangement,\r\nunder such conditions, we most easily and immediately comprehend the\r\nsubsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design\r\nas that which I have suggested—the design of variety out of\r\nunity—diversity out of sameness—heterogeneity out of\r\nhomogeneity—complexity out of simplicity—in a word, the utmost possible\r\nmultiplicity of _relation_ out of the emphatically irrelative _One_.\r\nUndoubtedly, therefore, we _should_ be warranted in assuming all that\r\nhas been mentioned, but for the reflection, first, that supererogation\r\nis not presumable of any Divine Act; and, secondly, that the object\r\nsupposed in view, appears as feasible when some of the conditions in\r\nquestion are dispensed with, in the beginning, as when all are\r\nunderstood immediately to exist. I mean to say that some are involved in\r\nthe rest, or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the\r\ndistinction inappreciable. Difference of _size_, for example, will at\r\nonce be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second, in\r\npreference to a third, on account of particular inequidistance; which is\r\nto be comprehended as _particular inequidistances between centres of\r\nquantity, in neighboring atoms of different form_—a matter not at all\r\ninterfering with the generally-equable distribution of the atoms.\r\nDifference of _kind_, too, is easily conceived to be merely a result of\r\ndifferences in size and form, taken more or less conjointly:—in fact,\r\nsince the _Unity_ of the Particle Proper implies absolute homogeneity,\r\nwe cannot imagine the atoms, at their diffusion, differing in kind,\r\nwithout imagining, at the same time, a special exercise of the Divine\r\nWill, at the emission of each atom, for the purpose of effecting, in\r\neach, a change of its essential nature:—so fantastic an idea is the\r\nless to be indulged, as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly\r\nattainable without such minute and elaborate interposition. We perceive,\r\ntherefore, upon the whole, that it would be supererogatory, and\r\nconsequently unphilosophical, to predicate of the atoms, in view of\r\ntheir purposes, any thing more than _difference of form_ at their\r\ndispersion, with particular inequidistance after it—all other\r\ndifferences arising at once out of these, in the very first processes of\r\nmass-constitution:—We thus establish the Universe on a purely\r\n_geometrical_ basis. Of course, it is by no means necessary to assume\r\nabsolute difference, even of form, among _all_ the atoms irradiated—any\r\nmore than absolute particular inequidistance of each from each. We are\r\nrequired to conceive merely that no _neighboring_ atoms are of similar\r\nform—no atoms which can ever approximate, until their inevitable\r\nrëunition at the end.\r\n\r\nAlthough the immediate and perpetual _tendency_ of the disunited atoms\r\nto return into their normal Unity, is implied, as I have said, in their\r\nabnormal diffusion; still it is clear that this tendency will be without\r\nconsequence—a tendency and no more—until the diffusive energy, in\r\nceasing to be exerted, shall leave _it_, the tendency, free to seek its\r\nsatisfaction. The Divine Act, however, being considered as determinate,\r\nand discontinued on fulfilment of the diffusion, we understand, at once,\r\na _rëaction_—in other words, a _satisfiable_ tendency of the disunited\r\natoms to return into _One_.\r\n\r\nBut the diffusive energy being withdrawn, and the rëaction having\r\ncommenced in furtherance of the ultimate design—_that of the utmost\r\npossible Relation_—this design is now in danger of being frustrated, in\r\ndetail, by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect its\r\naccomplishment in general. _Multiplicity_ is the object; but there is\r\nnothing to prevent proximate atoms, from lapsing _at once_, through the\r\nnow satisfiable tendency—_before_ the fulfilment of any ends proposed in\r\nmultiplicity—into absolute oneness among themselves:—there is nothing to\r\nimpede the aggregation of various _unique_ masses, at various points of\r\nspace:—in other words, nothing to interfere with the accumulation of\r\nvarious masses, each absolutely One.\r\n\r\nFor the effectual and thorough completion of the general design, we thus\r\nsee the necessity for a repulsion of limited capacity—a separative\r\n_something_ which, on withdrawal of the diffusive Volition, shall at the\r\nsame time allow the approach, and forbid the junction, of the atoms;\r\nsuffering them infinitely to approximate, while denying them positive\r\ncontact; in a word, having the power—_up to a certain epoch_—of\r\npreventing their _coalition_, but no ability to interfere with their\r\n_coalescence_ in any respect _or degree_. The repulsion, already\r\nconsidered as so peculiarly limited in other regards, must be\r\nunderstood, let me repeat, as having power to prevent absolute\r\ncoalition, _only up to a certain epoch_. Unless we are to conceive that\r\nthe appetite for Unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied\r\n_never_;—unless we are to conceive that what had a beginning is to have\r\nno end—a conception which cannot _really_ be entertained, however much\r\nwe may talk or dream of entertaining it—we are forced to conclude that\r\nthe repulsive influence imagined, will, finally—under pressure of the\r\n_Unitendency collectively_ applied, but never and in no degree _until_,\r\non fulfilment of the Divine purposes, such collective application shall\r\nbe naturally made—yield to a force which, at that ultimate epoch, shall\r\nbe the superior force precisely to the extent required, and thus permit\r\nthe universal subsidence into the inevitable, because original and\r\ntherefore normal, _One_.—The conditions here to be reconciled are\r\ndifficult indeed:—we cannot even comprehend the possibility of their\r\nconciliation;—nevertheless, the apparent impossibility is brilliantly\r\nsuggestive.\r\n\r\nThat the repulsive something actually exists, _we see_. Man neither\r\nemploys, nor knows, a force sufficient to bring two atoms into contact.\r\nThis is but the well-established proposition of the impenetrability of\r\nmatter. All Experiment proves—all Philosophy admits it. The _design_ of\r\nthe repulsion—the necessity for its existence—I have endeavored to show;\r\nbut from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously\r\nabstained; this on account of an intuitive conviction that the principle\r\nat issue is strictly spiritual—lies in a recess impervious to our\r\npresent understanding—lies involved in a consideration of what now—in\r\nour human state—is _not_ to be considered—in a consideration of _Spirit\r\nin itself_. I feel, in a word, that here the God has interposed, and\r\nhere only, because here and here only the knot demanded the\r\ninterposition of the God.\r\n\r\nIn fact, while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into Unity,\r\nwill be recognized, at once, as the principle of the Newtonian Gravity,\r\nwhat I have spoken of as a repulsive influence prescribing limits to the\r\n(immediate) satisfaction of the tendency, will be understood as _that_\r\nwhich we have been in the practice of designating now as heat, now as\r\nmagnetism, now as _electricity_; displaying our ignorance of its awful\r\ncharacter in the vacillation of the phraseology with which we endeavor\r\nto circumscribe it.\r\n\r\nCalling it, merely for the moment, electricity, we know that all\r\nexperimental analysis of electricity has given, as an ultimate result,\r\nthe principle, or seeming principle, _heterogeneity_. _Only_ where\r\nthings differ is electricity apparent; and it is presumable that they\r\n_never_ differ where it is not developed at least, if not apparent. Now,\r\nthis result is in the fullest keeping with that which I have reached\r\nunempirically. The design of the repulsive influence I have maintained\r\nto be that of preventing immediate Unity among the diffused atoms; and\r\nthese atoms are represented as different each from each. _Difference_ is\r\ntheir character—their essentiality—just as _no-difference_ was the\r\nessentiality of their source. When we say, then, that an attempt to\r\nbring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort, on the\r\npart of the repulsive influence, to prevent the contact, we may as well\r\nuse the strictly convertible sentence that an attempt to bring together\r\nany two differences will result in a development of electricity. All\r\nexisting bodies, of course, are composed of these atoms in proximate\r\ncontact, and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more\r\nor fewer differences; and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit,\r\non bringing together any two such assemblages, would be in the ratio of\r\nthe two sums of the differences in each:—an expression which, when\r\nreduced, is equivalent to this:—_The amount of electricity developed on\r\nthe approximation of two bodies, is proportional to the difference\r\nbetween the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are\r\ncomposed._ That _no_ two bodies are absolutely alike, is a simple\r\ncorollary from all that has been here said. Electricity, therefore,\r\nexisting always, is _developed_ whenever _any_ bodies, but _manifested_\r\nonly when bodies of appreciable difference, are brought into\r\napproximation.\r\n\r\nTo electricity—so, for the present, continuing to call it—we _may_ not\r\nbe wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light, heat\r\nand magnetism; but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to\r\nthis strictly spiritual principle the more important phænomena of\r\nvitality, consciousness and _Thought_. On this topic, however, I need\r\npause _here_ merely to suggest that these phænomena, whether observed\r\ngenerally or in detail, seem to proceed _at least in the ratio of the\r\nheterogeneous_.\r\n\r\nDiscarding now the two equivocal terms, “gravitation” and “electricity,”\r\nlet us adopt the more definite expressions, “_attraction_” and\r\n“_repulsion_.” The former is the body; the latter the soul: the one is\r\nthe material; the other the spiritual, principle of the Universe. _No\r\nother principles exist._ _All_ phænomena are referable to one, or to the\r\nother, or to both combined. So rigorously is this the case—so thoroughly\r\ndemonstrable is it that attraction and repulsion are the _sole_\r\nproperties through which we perceive the Universe—in other words, by\r\nwhich Matter is manifested to Mind—that, for all merely argumentative\r\npurposes, we are fully justified in assuming that matter _exists_ only\r\nas attraction and repulsion—that attraction and repulsion _are_\r\nmatter:—there being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the\r\nterm “matter” and the terms “attraction” and “repulsion,” taken\r\ntogether, as equivalent, and therefore convertible, expressions in\r\nLogic.\r\n\r\nI said, just now, that what I have described as the tendency of the\r\ndiffused atoms to return into their original unity, would be understood\r\nas the principle of the Newtonian law of gravity: and, in fact, there\r\ncan be little difficulty in such an understanding, if we look at the\r\nNewtonian gravity in a merely general view, as a force impelling matter\r\nto seek matter; that is to say, when we pay no attention to the known\r\n_modus operandi_ of the Newtonian force. The general coincidence\r\nsatisfies us; but, upon looking closely, we see, in detail, much that\r\nappears _in_coincident, and much in regard to which no coincidence, at\r\nleast, is established. For example; the Newtonian gravity, when we think\r\nof it in certain moods, does _not_ seem to be a tendency to _oneness_ at\r\nall, but rather a tendency of all bodies in all directions—a phrase\r\napparently expressive of a tendency to diffusion. Here, then, is an\r\n_in_coincidence. Again; when we reflect on the mathematical _law_\r\ngoverning the Newtonian tendency, we see clearly that no coincidence has\r\nbeen made good, in respect of the _modus operandi_, at least, between\r\ngravitation as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct\r\ntendency which I have assumed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I have attained a point at which it will be advisable to\r\nstrengthen my position by reversing my processes. So far, we have gone\r\non _à priori_, from an abstract consideration of _Simplicity_, as that\r\nquality most likely to have characterized the original action of God.\r\nLet us now see whether the established facts of the Newtonian\r\nGravitation may not afford us, _à posteriori_, some legitimate\r\ninductions.\r\n\r\nWhat does the Newtonian law declare?—That all bodies attract each other\r\nwith forces proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely\r\nproportional to the squares of their distances. Purposely, I have here\r\ngiven, in the first place, the vulgar version of the law; and I confess\r\nthat in this, as in most other vulgar versions of great truths, we find\r\nlittle of a suggestive character. Let us now adopt a more philosophical\r\nphraseology:—_Every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both\r\nof its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely\r\nas the squares of the distances between the attracting and attracted\r\natom._—Here, indeed, a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind.\r\n\r\nBut let us see distinctly what it was that Newton _proved_—according to\r\nthe grossly irrational definitions of _proof_ prescribed by the\r\nmetaphysical schools. He was forced to content himself with showing how\r\nthoroughly the motions of an imaginary Universe, composed of attracting\r\nand attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced, coincide with\r\nthose of the actually existing Universe so far as it comes under our\r\nobservation. This was the amount of his _demonstration_—that is to say,\r\nthis was the amount of it, according to the conventional cant of the\r\n“philosophies.” His successes added proof multiplied by proof—such proof\r\nas a sound intellect admits—but the _demonstration_ of the law itself,\r\npersist the metaphysicians, had not been strengthened in any degree.\r\n“_Ocular_, _physical_ proof,” however, of attraction, here upon Earth,\r\nin accordance with the Newtonian theory, was, at length, much to the\r\nsatisfaction of some intellectual grovellers, afforded. This proof arose\r\ncollaterally and incidentally (as nearly all important truths have\r\narisen) out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the Earth. In\r\nthe famous Maskelyne, Cavendish and Bailly experiments for this purpose,\r\nthe attraction of the mass of a mountain was seen, felt, measured, and\r\nfound to be mathematically consistent with the immortal theory of the\r\nBritish astronomer.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this confirmation of that which needed none—in spite of\r\nthe so-called corroboration of the “theory” by the so-called “ocular and\r\nphysical proof”—in spite of the _character_ of this corroboration—the\r\nideas which even really philosophical men cannot help imbibing of\r\ngravity—and, especially, the ideas of it which ordinary men get and\r\ncontentedly maintain, are _seen_ to have been derived, for the most\r\npart, from a consideration of the principle as they find it\r\ndeveloped—_merely in the planet upon which they stand_.\r\n\r\nNow, to what does so partial a consideration tend—to what species of\r\nerror does it give rise? On the Earth we _see_ and _feel_, only that\r\ngravity impels all bodies towards the _centre_ of the Earth. No man in\r\nthe common walks of life could be _made_ to see or to feel anything\r\nelse—could be made to perceive that anything, anywhere, has a perpetual,\r\ngravitating tendency in any _other_ direction than to the centre of the\r\nEarth; yet (with an exception hereafter to be specified) it is a fact\r\nthat every earthly thing (not to speak now of every heavenly thing) has\r\na tendency not _only_ to the Earth’s centre but in every conceivable\r\ndirection besides.\r\n\r\nNow, although the philosophic cannot be said to _err with_ the vulgar in\r\nthis matter, they nevertheless permit themselves to be influenced,\r\nwithout knowing it, by the _sentiment_ of the vulgar idea. “Although the\r\nPagan fables are not believed,” says Bryant, in his very erudite\r\n“Mythology,” “yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences\r\nfrom them as from existing realities.” I mean to assert that the merely\r\n_sensitive perception_ of gravity as we experience it on Earth, beguiles\r\nmankind into the fancy of _concentralization_ or _especiality_\r\nrespecting it—has been continually biasing towards this fancy even the\r\nmightiest intellects—perpetually, although imperceptibly, leading them\r\naway from the real characteristics of the principle; thus preventing\r\nthem, up to this date, from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth\r\nwhich lies in a diametrically opposite direction—behind the principle’s\r\n_essential_ characteristics—those, _not_ of concentralization or\r\nespeciality—but of _universality_ and _diffusion_. This “vital truth” is\r\n_Unity_ as the _source_ of the phænomenon.\r\n\r\nLet me now repeat the definition of gravity:—_Every atom, of every body,\r\nattracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body_,\r\nwith a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of\r\nthe attracting and attracted atom.\r\n\r\nHere let the reader pause with me, for a moment, in contemplation of the\r\nmiraculous—of the ineffable—of the altogether unimaginable complexity of\r\nrelation involved in the fact that _each atom attracts every other\r\natom_—involved merely in this fact of the attraction, without reference\r\nto the law or mode in which the attraction is manifested—involved\r\n_merely_ in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom _at all_,\r\nin a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the\r\ncomposition of a cannon-ball, exceed, probably, in mere point of number,\r\nall the stars which go to the constitution of the Universe.\r\n\r\nHad we discovered, simply, that each atom tended to some one favorite\r\npoint—to some especially attractive atom—we should still have fallen\r\nupon a discovery which, in itself, would have sufficed to overwhelm the\r\nmind:—but what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend?\r\nThat each atom attracts—sympathizes with the most delicate movements of\r\nevery other atom, and with each and with all at the same time, and\r\nforever, and according to a determinate law of which the complexity,\r\neven considered by itself solely, is utterly beyond the grasp of the\r\nimagination of man. If I propose to ascertain the influence of one mote\r\nin a sunbeam upon its neighboring mote, I cannot accomplish my purpose\r\nwithout first counting and weighing all the atoms in the Universe and\r\ndefining the precise positions of all at one particular moment. If I\r\nventure to displace, by even the billionth part of an inch, the\r\nmicroscopical speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my finger,\r\nwhat is the character of that act upon which I have adventured? I have\r\ndone a deed which shakes the Moon in her path, which causes the Sun to\r\nbe no longer the Sun, and which alters forever the destiny of the\r\nmultitudinous myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic\r\npresence of their Creator.\r\n\r\n_These_ ideas—conceptions such as _these_—unthoughtlike\r\nthoughts—soul-reveries rather than conclusions or even considerations\r\nof the intellect:—ideas, I repeat, such as these, are such as we can\r\nalone hope profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great\r\nprinciple, _Attraction_.\r\n\r\nBut now,—_with_ such ideas—with such a _vision_ of the marvellous\r\ncomplexity of Attraction fairly in his mind—let any person competent of\r\nthought on such topics as these, set himself to the task of imagining a\r\n_principle_ for the phænomena observed—a condition from which they\r\nsprang.\r\n\r\nDoes not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common\r\nparentage? Does not a sympathy so omniprevalent, so ineradicable, and so\r\nthoroughly irrespective, suggest a common paternity as its source? Does\r\nnot one extreme impel the reason to the other? Does not the infinitude\r\nof division refer to the utterness of individuality? Does not the\r\nentireness of the complex hint at the perfection of the simple? It is\r\n_not_ that the atoms, as we see them, are divided or that they are\r\ncomplex in their relations—but that they are inconceivably divided and\r\nunutterably complex:—it is the extremeness of the conditions to which I\r\nnow allude, rather than to the conditions themselves. In a word, is it\r\nnot because the atoms were, at some remote epoch of time, even _more\r\nthan together_—is it not because originally, and therefore normally,\r\nthey were _One_—that now, in all circumstances—at all points—in all\r\ndirections—by all modes of approach—in all relations and through all\r\nconditions—they struggle _back_ to this absolutely, this irrelatively,\r\nthis unconditionally _one_?\r\n\r\nSome person may here demand:—“Why—since it is to the _One_ that the\r\natoms struggle back—do we not find and define Attraction ‘a merely\r\ngeneral tendency to a centre?’—why, in especial, do not _your_\r\natoms—the atoms which you describe as having been irradiated from a\r\ncentre—proceed at once, rectilinearly, back to the central point of\r\ntheir origin?”\r\n\r\nI reply that _they do_; as will be distinctly shown; but that the cause\r\nof their so doing is quite irrespective of the centre _as such_. They\r\nall tend rectilinearly towards a centre, because of the sphereicity with\r\nwhich they have been irradiated into space. Each atom, forming one of a\r\ngenerally uniform globe of atoms, finds more atoms in the direction of\r\nthe centre, of course, than in any other, and in that direction,\r\ntherefore, is impelled—but is _not_ thus impelled because the centre is\r\n_the point of its origin_. It is not to any _point_ that the atoms are\r\nallied. It is not any _locality_, either in the concrete or in the\r\nabstract, to which I suppose them bound. Nothing like _location_ was\r\nconceived as their origin. Their source lies in the principle, _Unity_.\r\n_This_ is their lost parent. _This_ they seek always—immediately—in all\r\ndirections—wherever it is even partially to be found; thus appeasing, in\r\nsome measure, the ineradicable tendency, while on the way to its\r\nabsolute satisfaction in the end. It follows from all this, that any\r\nprinciple which shall be adequate to account for the _law_, or _modus\r\noperandi_, of the attractive force in general, will account for this law\r\nin particular:—that is to say, any principle which will show why the\r\natoms should tend to their _general centre of irradiation_ with forces\r\ninversely proportional to the squares of the distances, will be admitted\r\nas satisfactorily accounting, at the same time, for the tendency,\r\naccording to the same law, of these atoms each to each:—_for_ the\r\ntendency to the centre _is_ merely the tendency each to each, and not\r\nany tendency to a centre as such.—Thus it will be seen, also, that the\r\nestablishment of my propositions would involve no _necessity_ of\r\nmodification in the terms of the Newtonian definition of Gravity, which\r\ndeclares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth, and\r\ndeclares this merely; but (always under the supposition that what I\r\npropose be, in the end, admitted) it seems clear that some error might\r\noccasionally be avoided, in the future processes of Science, were a more\r\nample phraseology adopted:—for instance:—“Each atom tends to every other\r\natom &c. with a force &c.: _the general result being a tendency of all,\r\nwith a similar force, to a general centre_.”\r\n\r\nThe reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical\r\nresult; but, while in the one process _intuition_ was the\r\nstarting-point, in the other it was the goal. In commencing the former\r\njourney I could only say that, with an irresistible intuition, I _felt_\r\nSimplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of\r\nGod:—in ending the latter I can only declare that, with an irresistible\r\nintuition, I perceive Unity to have been the source of the observed\r\nphænomena of the Newtonian gravitation. Thus, according to the schools,\r\nI _prove_ nothing. So be it:—I design but to suggest—and to _convince_\r\nthrough the suggestion. I am proudly aware that there exist many of the\r\nmost profound and cautiously discriminative human intellects which\r\ncannot _help_ being abundantly content with my—suggestions. To these\r\nintellects—as to my own—there is no mathematical demonstration which\r\n_could_ bring the least additional _true proof_ of the great _Truth_\r\nwhich I have advanced—_the truth of Original Unity as the source—as the\r\nprinciple of the Universal Phænomena_. For my part, I am not so sure\r\nthat I speak and see—I am not so sure that my heart beats and that my\r\nsoul lives:—of the rising of to-morrow’s sun—a probability that as yet\r\nlies in the Future—I do not pretend to be one thousandth part as sure—as\r\nI am of the irretrievably by-gone _Fact_ that All Things and All\r\nThoughts of Things, with all their ineffable Multiplicity of Relation,\r\nsprang at once into being from the primordial and irrelative _One_.\r\n\r\nReferring to the Newtonian Gravity, Dr. Nichol, the eloquent author of\r\n“The Architecture of the Heavens,” says:—“In truth we have no reason to\r\nsuppose this great Law, as now revealed, to be the ultimate or simplest,\r\nand therefore the universal and all-comprehensive, form of a great\r\nOrdinance. The mode in which its intensity diminishes with the element\r\nof distance, has not the aspect of an ultimate _principle_; which always\r\nassumes the simplicity and self-evidence of those axioms which\r\nconstitute the basis of Geometry.”\r\n\r\nNow, it is quite true that “ultimate principles,” in the common\r\nunderstanding of the words, always assume the simplicity of geometrical\r\naxioms—(as for “self-evidence,” there is no such thing)—but these\r\nprinciples are clearly _not_ “ultimate;” in other terms what we are in\r\nthe habit of calling principles are no principles, properly\r\nspeaking—since there can be but one _principle_, the Volition of God. We\r\nhave no right to assume, then, from what we observe in rules that we\r\nchoose foolishly to name “principles,” anything at all in respect to the\r\ncharacteristics of a principle proper. The “ultimate principles” of\r\nwhich Dr. Nichol speaks as having geometrical simplicity, may and do\r\nhave this geometrical turn, as being part and parcel of a vast\r\ngeometrical system, and thus a system of simplicity itself—in which,\r\nnevertheless, the _truly_ ultimate principle is, _as we know_, the\r\nconsummation of the complex—that is to say, of the unintelligible—for is\r\nit not the Spiritual Capacity of God?\r\n\r\nI quoted Dr. Nichol’s remark, however, not so much to question its\r\nphilosophy, as by way of calling attention to the fact that, while all\r\nmen have admitted _some_ principle as existing behind the Law of\r\nGravity, no attempt has been yet made to point out what this principle\r\nin particular _is_:—if we except, perhaps, occasional fantastic efforts\r\nat referring it to Magnetism, or Mesmerism, or Swedenborgianism, or\r\nTranscendentalism, or some other equally delicious _ism_ of the same\r\nspecies, and invariably patronized by one and the same species of\r\npeople. The great mind of Newton, while boldly grasping the Law itself,\r\nshrank from the principle of the Law. The more fluent and comprehensive\r\nat least, if not the more patient and profound, sagacity of Laplace, had\r\nnot the courage to attack it. But hesitation on the part of these two\r\nastronomers it is, perhaps, not so very difficult to understand. They,\r\nas well as all the first class of mathematicians, were mathematicians\r\n_solely_:—their intellect, at least, had a firmly-pronounced\r\nmathematico-physical tone. What lay not distinctly within the domain of\r\nPhysics, or of Mathematics, seemed to them either Non-Entity or Shadow.\r\nNevertheless, we may well wonder that Leibnitz, who was a marked\r\nexception to the general rule in these respects, and whose mental\r\ntemperament was a singular admixture of the mathematical with the\r\nphysico-metaphysical, did not at once investigate and establish the\r\npoint at issue. Either Newton or Laplace, seeking a principle and\r\ndiscovering none _physical_, would have rested contentedly in the\r\nconclusion that there was absolutely none; but it is almost impossible\r\nto fancy, of Leibnitz, that, having exhausted in his search the physical\r\ndominions, he would not have stepped at once, boldly and hopefully, amid\r\nhis old familiar haunts in the kingdom of Metaphysics. Here, indeed, it\r\nis clear that he _must_ have adventured in search of the treasure:—that\r\nhe did not find it after all, was, perhaps, because his fairy guide,\r\nImagination, was not sufficiently well-grown, or well-educated, to\r\ndirect him aright.\r\n\r\nI observed, just now, that, in fact, there had been certain vague\r\nattempts at referring Gravity to some very uncertain _isms_. These\r\nattempts, however, although considered bold and justly so considered,\r\nlooked no farther than to the generality—the merest generality—of the\r\nNewtonian Law. Its _modus operandi_ has never, to my knowledge, been\r\napproached in the way of an effort at explanation. It is, therefore,\r\nwith no unwarranted fear of being taken for a madman at the outset, and\r\nbefore I can bring my propositions fairly to the eye of those who alone\r\nare competent to decide upon them, that I here declare the _modus\r\noperandi_ of the Law of Gravity to be an exceedingly simple and\r\nperfectly explicable thing—that is to say, when we make our advances\r\ntowards it in just gradations and in the true direction—when we regard\r\nit from the proper point of view.\r\n\r\nWhether we reach the idea of absolute _Unity_ as the source of All\r\nThings, from a consideration of Simplicity as the most probable\r\ncharacteristic of the original action of God;—whether we arrive at it\r\nfrom an inspection of the universality of relation in the gravitating\r\nphænomena;—or whether we attain it as a result of the mutual\r\ncorroboration afforded by both processes;—still, the idea itself, if\r\nentertained at all, is entertained in inseparable connection with\r\nanother idea—that of the condition of the Universe of stars as we _now_\r\nperceive it—that is to say, a condition of immeasurable _diffusion_\r\nthrough space. Now a connection between these two ideas—unity and\r\ndiffusion—cannot be established unless through the entertainment of a\r\nthird idea—that of _irradiation_. Absolute Unity being taken as a\r\ncentre, then the existing Universe of stars is the result of\r\n_irradiation_ from that centre.\r\n\r\nNow, the laws of irradiation are _known_. They are part and parcel of\r\nthe _sphere_. They belong to the class of _indisputable geometrical\r\nproperties_. We say of them, “they are true—they are evident.” To demand\r\n_why_ they are true, would be to demand why the axioms are true upon\r\nwhich their demonstration is based. _Nothing_ is demonstrable, strictly\r\nspeaking; but _if_ anything _be_, then the properties—the laws in\r\nquestion are demonstrated.\r\n\r\nBut these laws—what do they declare? Irradiation—how—by what steps does\r\nit proceed outwardly from a centre?\r\n\r\nFrom a _luminous_ centre, _Light_ issues by irradiation; and the\r\nquantities of light received upon any given plane, supposed to be\r\nshifting its position so as to be now nearer the centre and now farther\r\nfrom it, will be diminished in the same proportion as the squares of the\r\ndistances of the plane from the luminous body, are increased; and will\r\nbe increased in the same proportion as these squares are diminished.\r\n\r\nThe expression of the law may be thus generalized:—the number of\r\nlight-particles (or, if the phrase be preferred, the number of\r\nlight-impressions) received upon the shifting plane, will be _inversely_\r\nproportional with the squares of the distances of the plane.\r\nGeneralizing yet again, we may say that the diffusion—the scattering—the\r\nirradiation, in a word—is _directly_ proportional with the squares of\r\nthe distances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor example: at the distance B, from the luminous centre A, a certain\r\nnumber of particles are so diffused as to occupy the surface B. Then at\r\ndouble the distance—that is to say at C—they will be so much farther\r\ndiffused as to occupy four such surfaces:—at treble the distance, or at\r\nD, they will be so much farther separated as to occupy nine such\r\nsurfaces:—while, at quadruple the distance, or at E, they will have\r\nbecome so scattered as to spread themselves over sixteen such\r\nsurfaces—and so on forever.\r\n\r\nIn saying, generally, that the irradiation proceeds in direct proportion\r\nwith the squares of the distances, we use the term irradiation to\r\nexpress _the degree of the diffusion_ as we proceed outwardly from the\r\ncentre. Conversing the idea, and employing the word “concentralization”\r\nto express _the degree of the drawing together_ as we come back toward\r\nthe centre from an outward position, we may say that concentralization\r\nproceeds _inversely_ as the squares of the distances. In other words, we\r\nhave reached the conclusion that, on the hypothesis that matter was\r\noriginally irradiated from a centre and is now returning to it, the\r\nconcentralization, in the return, proceeds _exactly as we know the force\r\nof gravitation to proceed_.\r\n\r\nNow here, if we could be permitted to assume that concentralization\r\nexactly represented the _force of the tendency to the centre_—that the\r\none was exactly proportional to the other, and that the two proceeded\r\ntogether—we should have shown all that is required. The sole difficulty\r\nexisting, then, is to establish a direct proportion between\r\n“concentralization” and the _force_ of concentralization; and this is\r\ndone, of course, if we establish such proportion between “irradiation”\r\nand the _force_ of irradiation.\r\n\r\nA very slight inspection of the Heavens assures us that the stars have a\r\ncertain general uniformity, equability, or equidistance, of distribution\r\nthrough that region of space in which, collectively, and in a roughly\r\nglobular form, they are situated:—this species of very general, rather\r\nthan absolute, equability, being in full keeping with my deduction of\r\ninequidistance, within certain limits, among the originally diffused\r\natoms, as a corollary from the evident design of infinite complexity of\r\nrelation out of irrelation. I started, it will be remembered, with the\r\nidea of a generally uniform but particularly _un_uniform distribution of\r\nthe atoms;—an idea, I repeat, which an inspection of the stars, as they\r\nexist, confirms.\r\n\r\nBut even in the merely general equability of distribution, as regards\r\nthe atoms, there appears a difficulty which, no doubt, has already\r\nsuggested itself to those among my readers who have borne in mind that I\r\nsuppose this equability of distribution effected through _irradiation\r\nfrom a centre_. The very first glance at the idea, irradiation, forces\r\nus to the entertainment of the hitherto unseparated and seemingly\r\ninseparable idea of agglomeration about a centre, with dispersion as we\r\nrecede from it—the idea, in a word, of _in_equability of distribution in\r\nrespect to the matter irradiated.\r\n\r\nNow, I have elsewhere[1] observed that it is by just such difficulties\r\nas the one now in question—such roughnesses—such peculiarities—such\r\nprotuberances above the plane of the ordinary—that Reason feels her way,\r\nif at all, in her search for the True. By the difficulty—the\r\n“peculiarity”—now presented, I leap at once to _the_ secret—a secret\r\nwhich I might never have attained _but_ for the peculiarity and the\r\ninferences which, _in its mere character of peculiarity_, it affords me.\r\n\r\n    [1] “_Murders in the Rue Morgue_”—p. 133.\r\n\r\nThe process of thought, at this point, may be thus roughly sketched:—I\r\nsay to myself—“Unity, as I have explained it, is a truth—I feel it.\r\nDiffusion is a truth—I see it. Irradiation, by which alone these two\r\ntruths are reconciled, is a consequent truth—I perceive it. _Equability_\r\nof diffusion, first deduced _à priori_ and then corroborated by the\r\ninspection of phænomena, is also a truth—I fully admit it. So far all is\r\nclear around me:—there are no clouds behind which _the_ secret—the great\r\nsecret of the gravitating _modus operandi_—can possibly lie hidden;—but\r\nthis secret lies _hereabouts_, most assuredly; and _were_ there but a\r\ncloud in view, I should be driven to suspicion of that cloud.” And now,\r\njust as I say this, there actually comes a cloud into view. This cloud\r\nis the seeming impossibility of reconciling my truth, _irradiation_,\r\nwith my truth, _equability of diffusion_. I say now:—“Behind this\r\n_seeming_ impossibility is to be found what I desire.” I do not say\r\n“_real_ impossibility;” for invincible faith in my truths assures me\r\nthat it is a mere difficulty after all—but I go on to say, with\r\nunflinching confidence, that, _when_ this _difficulty_ shall be solved,\r\nwe shall find, _wrapped up in the process of solution_, the key to the\r\nsecret at which we aim. Moreover—I _feel_ that we shall discover _but\r\none_ possible solution of the difficulty; this for the reason that, were\r\nthere two, one would be supererogatory—would be fruitless—would be\r\nempty—would contain no key—since no duplicate key can be needed to any\r\nsecret of Nature.\r\n\r\nAnd now, let us see:—Our usual notions of irradiation—in fact _all_ our\r\ndistinct notions of it—are caught merely from the process as we see it\r\nexemplified in _Light_. Here there is a _continuous_ outpouring of\r\n_ray-streams_, and _with a force which we have at least no right to\r\nsuppose varies at all_. Now, in any such irradiation _as\r\nthis_—continuous and of unvarying force—the regions nearer the centre\r\nmust _inevitably_ be always more crowded with the irradiated matter than\r\nthe regions more remote. But I have assumed _no_ such irradiation _as\r\nthis_. I assumed no _continuous_ irradiation; and for the simple reason\r\nthat such an assumption would have involved, first, the necessity of\r\nentertaining a conception which I have shown no man _can_ entertain, and\r\nwhich (as I will more fully explain hereafter) all observation of the\r\nfirmament refutes—the conception of the absolute infinity of the\r\nUniverse of stars—and would have involved, secondly, the impossibility\r\nof understanding a rëaction—that is, gravitation—as existing now—since,\r\nwhile an act is continued, no rëaction, of course, can take place. My\r\nassumption, then, or rather my inevitable deduction from just\r\npremises—was that of a _determinate_ irradiation—one finally\r\n_dis_continued.\r\n\r\nLet me now describe the sole possible mode in which it is conceivable\r\nthat matter could have been diffused through space, so as to fulfil the\r\nconditions at once of irradiation and of generally equable distribution.\r\n\r\nFor convenience of illustration, let us imagine, in the first place, a\r\nhollow sphere of glass, or of anything else, occupying the space\r\nthroughout which the universal matter is to be thus equally diffused, by\r\nmeans of irradiation, from the absolute, irrelative, unconditional\r\nparticle, placed in the centre of the sphere.\r\n\r\nNow, a certain exertion of the diffusive power (presumed to be the\r\nDivine Volition)—in other words, a certain _force_—whose measure is the\r\nquantity of matter—that is to say, the number of atoms—emitted; emits,\r\nby irradiation, this certain number of atoms; forcing them in all\r\ndirections outwardly from the centre—their proximity to each other\r\ndiminishing as they proceed—until, finally, they are distributed,\r\nloosely, over the interior surface of the sphere.\r\n\r\nWhen these atoms have attained this position, or while proceeding to\r\nattain it, a second and inferior exercise of the same force—or a second\r\nand inferior force of the same character—emits, in the same manner—that\r\nis to say, by irradiation as before—a second stratum of atoms which\r\nproceeds to deposit itself upon the first; the number of atoms, in this\r\ncase as in the former, being of course the measure of the force which\r\nemitted them; in other words the force being precisely adapted to the\r\npurpose it effects—the force and the number of atoms sent out by the\r\nforce, being _directly proportional_.\r\n\r\nWhen this second stratum has reached its destined position—or while\r\napproaching it—a third still inferior exertion of the force, or a third\r\ninferior force of a similar character—the number of atoms emitted being\r\nin _all_ cases the measure of the force—proceeds to deposit a third\r\nstratum upon the second:—and so on, until these concentric strata,\r\ngrowing gradually less and less, come down at length to the central\r\npoint; and the diffusive matter, simultaneously with the diffusive\r\nforce, is exhausted.\r\n\r\nWe have now the sphere filled, through means of irradiation, with atoms\r\nequably diffused. The two necessary conditions—those of irradiation and\r\nof equable diffusion—are satisfied; and by the _sole_ process in which\r\nthe possibility of their simultaneous satisfaction is conceivable. For\r\nthis reason, I confidently expect to find, lurking in the present\r\ncondition of the atoms as distributed throughout the sphere, the secret\r\nof which I am in search—the all-important principle of the _modus\r\noperandi_ of the Newtonian law. Let us examine, then, the actual\r\ncondition of the atoms.\r\n\r\nThey lie in a series of concentric strata. They are equably diffused\r\nthroughout the sphere. They have been irradiated into these states.\r\n\r\nThe atoms being _equably_ distributed, the greater the superficial\r\nextent of any of these concentric strata, or spheres, the more atoms\r\nwill lie upon it. In other words, the number of atoms lying upon the\r\nsurface of any one of the concentric spheres, is directly proportional\r\nwith the extent of that surface.\r\n\r\n_But, in any series of concentric spheres, the surfaces are directly\r\nproportional with the squares of the distances from the centre._[2]\r\n\r\n    [2] Succinctly—The surfaces of spheres are as the squares of\r\n    their radii.\r\n\r\nTherefore the number of atoms in any stratum is directly proportional\r\nwith the square of that stratum’s distance from the centre.\r\n\r\nBut the number of atoms in any stratum is the measure of the force which\r\nemitted that stratum—that is to say, is _directly proportional_ with the\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nTherefore the force which irradiated any stratum is directly\r\nproportional with the square of that stratum’s distance from the\r\ncentre:—or, generally,\r\n\r\n_The force of the irradiation has been directly proportional with the\r\nsquares of the distances._\r\n\r\nNow, Rëaction, as far as we know anything of it, is Action conversed.\r\nThe _general_ principle of Gravity being, in the first place, understood\r\nas the rëaction of an act—as the expression of a desire on the part of\r\nMatter, while existing in a state of diffusion, to return into the Unity\r\nwhence it was diffused; and, in the second place, the mind being called\r\nupon to determine the _character_ of the desire—the manner in which it\r\nwould, naturally, be manifested; in other words, being called upon to\r\nconceive a probable law, or _modus operandi_, for the return; could not\r\nwell help arriving at the conclusion that this law of return would be\r\nprecisely the converse of the law of departure. That such would be the\r\ncase, any one, at least, would be abundantly justified in taking for\r\ngranted, until such time as some person should suggest something like a\r\nplausible reason why it should _not_ be the case—until such period as a\r\nlaw of return shall be imagined which the intellect can consider as\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\nMatter, then, irradiated into space with a force varying as the squares\r\nof the distances, might, _à priori_, be supposed to return towards its\r\ncentre of irradiation with a force varying _inversely_ as the squares of\r\nthe distances: and I have already shown[3] that any principle which will\r\nexplain why the atoms should tend, according to any law, to the general\r\ncentre, must be admitted as satisfactorily explaining, at the same time,\r\nwhy, according to the same law, they should tend each to each. For, in\r\nfact, the tendency to the general centre is not to a centre as such, but\r\nbecause of its being a point in tending towards which each atom tends\r\nmost directly to its real and essential centre, _Unity_—the absolute\r\nand final Union of all.\r\n\r\n    [3] Page 44.\r\n\r\nThe consideration here involved presents to my own mind no embarrassment\r\nwhatever—but this fact does not blind me to the possibility of its being\r\nobscure to those who may have been less in the habit of dealing with\r\nabstractions:—and, upon the whole, it may be as well to look at the\r\nmatter from one or two other points of view.\r\n\r\nThe absolute, irrelative particle primarily created by the Volition of\r\nGod, must have been in a condition of positive _normality_, or\r\nrightfulness—for wrongfulness implies _relation_. Right is positive;\r\nwrong is negative—is merely the negation of right; as cold is the\r\nnegation of heat—darkness of light. That a thing may be wrong, it is\r\nnecessary that there be some other thing in _relation_ to which it _is_\r\nwrong—some condition which it fails to satisfy; some law which it\r\nviolates; some being whom it aggrieves. If there be no such being, law,\r\nor condition, in respect to which the thing is wrong—and, still more\r\nespecially, if no beings, laws, or conditions exist at all—then the\r\nthing can_not_ be wrong and consequently must be _right_. Any deviation\r\nfrom normality involves a tendency to return into it. A difference from\r\nthe normal—from the right—from the just—can be understood as effected\r\nonly by the overcoming a difficulty; and if the force which overcomes\r\nthe difficulty be not infinitely continued, the ineradicable tendency to\r\nreturn will at length be permitted to act for its own satisfaction. Upon\r\nwithdrawal of the force, the tendency acts. This is the principle of\r\nrëaction as the inevitable consequence of finite action. Employing a\r\nphraseology of which the seeming affectation will be pardoned for its\r\nexpressiveness, we may say that Rëaction is the return from the\r\ncondition of _as it is and ought not to be_ into the condition of _as it\r\nwas, originally, and therefore ought to be_:—and let me add here that\r\nthe _absolute_ force of Rëaction would no doubt be always found in\r\ndirect proportion with the reality—the truth—the absoluteness—of the\r\n_originality_—if ever it were possible to measure this latter:—and,\r\nconsequently, the greatest of all conceivable reactions must be that\r\nproduced by the tendency which we now discuss—the tendency to return\r\ninto the _absolutely original_—into the _supremely_ primitive. Gravity,\r\nthen, _must be the strongest of forces_—an idea reached _à priori_ and\r\nabundantly confirmed by induction. What use I make of the idea, will be\r\nseen in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe atoms, now, having been diffused from their normal condition of\r\nUnity, seek to return to——what? Not to any particular _point_,\r\ncertainly; for it is clear that if, upon the diffusion, the whole\r\nUniverse of matter had been projected, collectively, to a distance from\r\nthe point of irradiation, the atomic tendency to the general centre of\r\nthe sphere would not have been disturbed in the least:—the atoms would\r\nnot have sought the point _in absolute space_ from which they were\r\noriginally impelled. It is merely the _condition_, and not the point or\r\nlocality at which this condition took its rise, that these atoms seek to\r\nre-establish;—it is merely _that condition which is their normality_,\r\nthat they desire. “But they seek a centre,” it will be said, “and a\r\ncentre is a point.” True; but they seek this point not in its character\r\nof point—(for, were the whole sphere moved from its position, they would\r\nseek, equally, the centre; and the centre _then_ would be a _new_\r\npoint)—but because it so happens, on account of the form in which they\r\ncollectively exist—(that of the sphere)—that only _through_ the point in\r\nquestion—the sphere’s centre—they can attain their true object, Unity.\r\nIn the direction of the centre each atom perceives more atoms than in\r\nany other direction. Each atom is impelled towards the centre because\r\nalong the straight line joining it and the centre and passing on to the\r\ncircumference beyond, there lie a greater number of atoms than along any\r\nother straight line—a greater number of objects that seek it, the\r\nindividual atom—a greater number of tendencies to Unity—a greater number\r\nof satisfactions for its own tendency to Unity—in a word, because in the\r\ndirection of the centre lies the utmost possibility of satisfaction,\r\ngenerally, for its own individual appetite. To be brief, the\r\n_condition_, Unity, is all that is really sought; and if the atoms\r\n_seem_ to seek the centre of the sphere, it is only impliedly, through\r\nimplication—because such centre happens to imply, to include, or to\r\ninvolve, the only essential centre, Unity. But _on account of_ this\r\nimplication or involution, there is no possibility of practically\r\nseparating the tendency to Unity in the abstract, from the tendency to\r\nthe concrete centre. Thus the tendency of the atoms to the general\r\ncentre _is_, to all practical intents and for all logical purposes, the\r\ntendency each to each; and the tendency each to each _is_ the tendency\r\nto the centre; and the one tendency may be assumed _as_ the other;\r\nwhatever will apply to the one must be thoroughly applicable to the\r\nother; and, in conclusion, whatever principle will satisfactorily\r\nexplain the one, cannot be questioned as an explanation of the other.\r\n\r\nIn looking carefully around me for rational objection to what I have\r\nadvanced, I am able to discover _nothing_;—but of that class of\r\nobjections usually urged by the doubters for Doubt’s sake, I very\r\nreadily perceive _three_; and proceed to dispose of them in order.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, first: “The proof that the force of irradiation (in the\r\ncase described) is directly proportional to the squares of the\r\ndistances, depends upon an unwarranted assumption—that of the number of\r\natoms in each stratum being the measure of the force with which they are\r\nemitted.”\r\n\r\nI reply, not only that I am warranted in such assumption, but that I\r\nshould be utterly _un_warranted in any other. What I assume is, simply,\r\nthat an effect is the measure of its cause—that every exercise of the\r\nDivine Will will be proportional to that which demands the exertion—that\r\nthe means of Omnipotence, or of Omniscience, will be exactly adapted to\r\nits purposes. Neither can a deficiency nor an excess of cause bring to\r\npass any effect. Had the force which irradiated any stratum to its\r\nposition, been either more or less than was needed for the purpose—that\r\nis to say, not _directly proportional_ to the purpose—then to its\r\nposition that stratum could not have been irradiated. Had the force\r\nwhich, with a view to general equability of distribution, emitted the\r\nproper number of atoms for each stratum, been not _directly\r\nproportional_ to the number, then the number would _not_ have been the\r\nnumber demanded for the equable distribution.\r\n\r\nThe second supposable objection is somewhat better entitled to an\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nIt is an admitted principle in Dynamics that every body, on receiving an\r\nimpulse, or disposition to move, will move onward in a straight line, in\r\nthe direction imparted by the impelling force, until deflected, or\r\nstopped, by some other force. How then, it may be asked, is my first or\r\nexternal stratum of atoms to be understood as discontinuing their\r\nmovement at the circumference of the imaginary glass sphere, when no\r\nsecond force, of more than an imaginary character, appears, to account\r\nfor the discontinuance?\r\n\r\nI reply that the objection, in this case, actually does arise out of “an\r\nunwarranted assumption”—on the part of the objector—the assumption of a\r\nprinciple, in Dynamics, at an epoch when _no_ “principles,” in\r\n_anything_, exist:—I use the word “principle,” of course, in the\r\nobjector’s understanding of the word.\r\n\r\n“In the beginning” we can admit—indeed we can comprehend—but one _First\r\nCause_—the truly ultimate _Principle_—the Volition of God. The primary\r\n_act_—that of Irradiation from Unity—must have been independent of all\r\nthat which the world now calls “principle”—because all that we so\r\ndesignate is but a consequence of the rëaction of that primary act:—I\r\nsay “_primary_” act; for the creation of the absolute material particle\r\nis more properly to be regarded as a _conception_ than as an “_act_” in\r\nthe ordinary meaning of the term. Thus, we must regard the primary act\r\nas an act for the establishment of what we now call “principles.” But\r\nthis primary act itself is to be considered as _continuous Volition_.\r\nThe Thought of God is to be understood as originating the Diffusion—as\r\nproceeding with it—as regulating it—and, finally, as being withdrawn\r\nfrom it upon its completion. _Then_ commences Rëaction, and through\r\nRëaction, “Principle,” as we employ the word. It will be advisable,\r\nhowever, to limit the application of this word to the two _immediate_\r\nresults of the discontinuance of the Divine Volition—that is, to the two\r\nagents, _Attraction_ and _Repulsion_. Every other Natural agent depends,\r\neither more or less immediately, upon these two, and therefore would be\r\nmore conveniently designated as _sub_-principle.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, thirdly, that, in general, the peculiar mode of\r\ndistribution which I have suggested for the atoms, is “an hypothesis and\r\nnothing more.”\r\n\r\nNow, I am aware that the word hypothesis is a ponderous sledge-hammer,\r\ngrasped immediately, if not lifted, by all very diminutive thinkers,\r\nupon the first appearance of any proposition wearing, in any particular,\r\nthe garb of _a theory_. But “hypothesis” cannot be wielded _here_ to any\r\ngood purpose, even by those who succeed in lifting it—little men or\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nI maintain, first, that _only_ in the mode described is it conceivable\r\nthat Matter could have been diffused so as to fulfil at once the\r\nconditions of irradiation and of generally equable distribution. I\r\nmaintain, secondly, that these conditions themselves have been imposed\r\nupon me, as necessities, in a train of ratiocination _as rigorously\r\nlogical as that which establishes any demonstration in Euclid_; and I\r\nmaintain, thirdly, that even if the charge of “hypothesis” were as fully\r\nsustained as it is, in fact, unsustained and untenable, still the\r\nvalidity and indisputability of my result would not, even in the\r\nslightest particular, be disturbed.\r\n\r\nTo explain:—The Newtonian Gravity—a law of Nature—a law whose existence\r\nas such no one out of Bedlam questions—a law whose admission as such\r\nenables us to account for nine-tenths of the Universal phænomena—a law\r\nwhich, merely because it does so enable us to account for these\r\nphænomena, we are perfectly willing, without reference to any other\r\nconsiderations, to admit, and cannot help admitting, as a law—a law,\r\nnevertheless, of which neither the principle nor the _modus operandi_ of\r\nthe principle, has ever yet been traced by the human analysis—a law, in\r\nshort, which, neither in its detail nor in its generality, has been\r\nfound susceptible of explanation _at all_—is at length seen to be at\r\nevery point thoroughly explicable, provided only we yield our assent\r\nto——what? To an hypothesis? Why _if_ an hypothesis—if the merest\r\nhypothesis—if an hypothesis for whose assumption—as in the case of that\r\n_pure_ hypothesis the Newtonian law itself—no shadow of _à priori_\r\nreason could be assigned—if an hypothesis, even so absolute as all this\r\nimplies, would enable us to perceive a principle for the Newtonian\r\nlaw—would enable us to understand as satisfied, conditions so\r\nmiraculously—so ineffably complex and seemingly irreconcileable as those\r\ninvolved in the relations of which Gravity tells us,—what rational being\r\n_could_ so expose his fatuity as to call even this absolute hypothesis\r\nan hypothesis any longer—unless, indeed, he were to persist in so\r\ncalling it, with the understanding that he did so, simply for the sake\r\nof consistency _in words_?\r\n\r\nBut what is the true state of our present case? What is _the fact_? Not\r\nonly that it is _not_ an hypothesis which we are required _to adopt_,\r\nin order to admit the principle at issue explained, but that it _is_ a\r\nlogical conclusion which we are requested _not_ to adopt if we can avoid\r\nit—which we are simply invited to _deny if we can_:—a conclusion of so\r\naccurate a logicality that to dispute it would be the effort—to doubt\r\nits validity beyond our power:—a conclusion from which we see no mode of\r\nescape, turn as we will; a result which confronts us either at the end\r\nof an _in_ductive journey from the phænomena of the very Law discussed,\r\nor at the close of a _de_ductive career from the most rigorously simple\r\nof all conceivable assumptions—_the assumption, in a word, of Simplicity\r\nitself_.\r\n\r\nAnd if here, for the mere sake of cavilling, it be urged, that although\r\nmy starting-point is, as I assert, the assumption of absolute\r\nSimplicity, yet Simplicity, considered merely in itself, is no axiom;\r\nand that only deductions from axioms are indisputable—it is thus that I\r\nreply:—\r\n\r\nEvery other science than Logic is the science of certain concrete\r\nrelations. Arithmetic, for example, is the science of the relations of\r\nnumber—Geometry, of the relations of form—Mathematics in general, of the\r\nrelations of quantity in general—of whatever can be increased or\r\ndiminished. Logic, however, is the science of Relation in the\r\nabstract—of absolute Relation—of Relation considered solely in itself.\r\nAn axiom in any particular science other than Logic is, thus, merely a\r\nproposition announcing certain concrete relations which seem to be too\r\nobvious for dispute—as when we say, for instance, that the whole is\r\ngreater than its part:—and, thus again, the principle of the _Logical_\r\naxiom—in other words, of an axiom in the abstract—is, simply,\r\n_obviousness of relation_. Now, it is clear, not only that what is\r\nobvious to one mind may not be obvious to another, but that what is\r\nobvious to one mind at one epoch, may be anything but obvious, at\r\nanother epoch, to the same mind. It is clear, moreover, that what,\r\nto-day, is obvious even to the majority of mankind, or to the majority\r\nof the best intellects of mankind, may to-morrow be, to either majority,\r\nmore or less obvious, or in no respect obvious at all. It is seen, then,\r\nthat the _axiomatic principle_ itself is susceptible of variation, and\r\nof course that axioms are susceptible of similar change. Being mutable,\r\nthe “truths” which grow out of them are necessarily mutable too; or, in\r\nother words, are never to be positively depended upon as truths at\r\nall—since Truth and Immutability are one.\r\n\r\nIt will now be readily understood that no axiomatic idea—no idea founded\r\nin the fluctuating principle, obviousness of relation—can possibly be so\r\nsecure—so reliable a basis for any structure erected by the Reason, as\r\n_that_ idea—(whatever it is, wherever we can find it, or _if_ it be\r\npracticable to find it anywhere)—which is _ir_relative altogether—which\r\nnot only presents to the understanding _no obviousness_ of relation,\r\neither greater or less, to be considered, but subjects the intellect,\r\nnot in the slightest degree, to the necessity of even looking at _any\r\nrelation at all_. If such an idea be not what we too heedlessly term “an\r\naxiom,” it is at least preferable, as a Logical basis, to any axiom ever\r\npropounded, or to all imaginable axioms combined:—and such, precisely,\r\nis the idea with which my deductive process, so thoroughly corroborated\r\nby induction, commences. My _particle proper_ is but _absolute\r\nIrrelation_. To sum up what has been here advanced:—As a starting point\r\nI have taken it for granted, simply, that the Beginning had nothing\r\nbehind it or before it—that it was a Beginning in fact—that it was a\r\nbeginning and nothing different from a beginning—in short that this\r\nBeginning was——_that which it was_. If this be a “mere assumption” then\r\na “mere assumption” let it be.\r\n\r\nTo conclude this branch of the subject:—I am fully warranted in\r\nannouncing that _the Law which we have been in the habit of calling\r\nGravity exists on account of Matter’s having been irradiated, at its\r\norigin, atomically, into a limited[4] sphere of Space, from one,\r\nindividual, unconditional, irrelative, and absolute Particle Proper, by\r\nthe sole process in which it was possible to satisfy, at the same time,\r\nthe two conditions, irradiation, and generally-equable distribution\r\nthroughout the sphere—that is to say, by a force varying in direct\r\nproportion with the squares of the distances between the irradiated\r\natoms, respectively, and the Particular centre of Irradiation_.\r\n\r\n    [4] Limited sphere—A sphere is _necessarily_ limited. I prefer\r\n    tautology to a chance of misconception.\r\n\r\nI have already given my reasons for presuming Matter to have been\r\ndiffused by a determinate rather than by a continuous or infinitely\r\ncontinued force. Supposing a continuous force, we should be unable, in\r\nthe first place, to comprehend a rëaction at all; and we should be\r\nrequired, in the second place, to entertain the impossible conception of\r\nan infinite extension of Matter. Not to dwell upon the impossibility of\r\nthe conception, the infinite extension of Matter is an idea which, if\r\nnot positively disproved, is at least not in any respect warranted by\r\ntelescopic observation of the stars—a point to be explained more fully\r\nhereafter; and this empirical reason for believing in the original\r\nfinity of Matter is unempirically confirmed. For example:—Admitting, for\r\nthe moment, the possibility of understanding Space _filled_ with the\r\nirradiated atoms—that is to say, admitting, as well as we can, for\r\nargument’s sake, that the succession of the irradiated atoms had\r\nabsolutely _no end_—then it is abundantly clear that, even when the\r\nVolition of God had been withdrawn from them, and thus the tendency to\r\nreturn into Unity permitted (abstractly) to be satisfied, this\r\npermission would have been nugatory and invalid—practically valueless\r\nand of no effect whatever. No Rëaction could have taken place; no\r\nmovement toward Unity could have been made; no Law of Gravity could have\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nTo explain:—Grant the _abstract_ tendency of any one atom to any one\r\nother as the inevitable result of diffusion from the normal Unity:—or,\r\nwhat is the same thing, admit any given atom as _proposing_ to move in\r\nany given direction—it is clear that, since there is an _infinity_ of\r\natoms on all sides of the atom proposing to move, it never can actually\r\nmove toward the satisfaction of its tendency in the direction given, on\r\naccount of a precisely equal and counterbalancing tendency in the\r\ndirection diametrically opposite. In other words, exactly as many\r\ntendencies to Unity are behind the hesitating atom as before it; for it\r\nis a mere sotticism to say that one infinite line is longer or shorter\r\nthan another infinite line, or that one infinite number is greater or\r\nless than another number that is infinite. Thus the atom in question\r\nmust remain stationary forever. Under the impossible circumstances which\r\nwe have been merely endeavoring to conceive for argument’s sake, there\r\ncould have been no aggregation of Matter—no stars—no worlds—nothing but\r\na perpetually atomic and inconsequential Universe. In fact, view it as\r\nwe will, the whole idea of unlimited Matter is not only untenable, but\r\nimpossible and preposterous.\r\n\r\nWith the understanding of a _sphere_ of atoms, however, we perceive, at\r\nonce, a _satisfiable_ tendency to union. The general result of the\r\ntendency each to each, being a tendency of all to the centre, the\r\n_general_ process of condensation, or approximation, commences\r\nimmediately, by a common and simultaneous movement, on withdrawal of the\r\nDivine Volition; the _individual_ approximations, or coalescences—_not_\r\ncöalitions—of atom with atom, being subject to almost infinite\r\nvariations of time, degree, and condition, on account of the excessive\r\nmultiplicity of relation, arising from the differences of form assumed\r\nas characterizing the atoms at the moment of their quitting the Particle\r\nProper; as well as from the subsequent particular inequidistance, each\r\nfrom each.\r\n\r\nWhat I wish to impress upon the reader is the certainty of there\r\narising, at once, (on withdrawal of the diffusive force, or Divine\r\nVolition,) out of the condition of the atoms as described, at\r\ninnumerable points throughout the Universal sphere, innumerable\r\nagglomerations, characterized by innumerable specific differences of\r\nform, size, essential nature, and distance each from each. The\r\ndevelopment of Repulsion (Electricity) must have commenced, of course,\r\nwith the very earliest particular efforts at Unity, and must have\r\nproceeded constantly in the ratio of Coalescence—that is to say, _in\r\nthat of Condensation_, or, again, of Heterogeneity.\r\n\r\nThus the two Principles Proper, _Attraction_ and _Repulsion_—the\r\nMaterial and the Spiritual—accompany each other, in the strictest\r\nfellowship, forever. Thus _The Body and The Soul walk hand in hand_.\r\n\r\nIf now, in fancy, we select _any one_ of the agglomerations considered\r\nas in their primary stages throughout the Universal sphere, and suppose\r\nthis incipient agglomeration to be taking place at that point where the\r\ncentre of our Sun exists—or rather where it _did_ exist originally; for\r\nthe Sun is perpetually shifting his position—we shall find ourselves\r\nmet, and borne onward for a time at least, by the most magnificent of\r\ntheories—by the Nebular Cosmogony of Laplace:—although “Cosmogony” is\r\nfar too comprehensive a term for what he really discusses—which is the\r\nconstitution of our solar system alone—of one among the myriad of\r\nsimilar systems which make up the Universe Proper—that Universal\r\nsphere—that all-inclusive and absolute _Kosmos_ which forms the subject\r\nof my present Discourse.\r\n\r\nConfining himself to an _obviously limited_ region—that of our solar\r\nsystem with its comparatively immediate vicinity—and _merely_\r\nassuming—that is to say, assuming without any basis whatever, either\r\ndeductive or inductive—_much_ of what I have been just endeavoring to\r\nplace upon a more stable basis than assumption; assuming, for example,\r\nmatter as diffused (without pretending to account for the diffusion)\r\nthroughout, and somewhat beyond, the space occupied by our\r\nsystem—diffused in a state of heterogeneous nebulosity and obedient to\r\nthat omniprevalent law of Gravity at whose principle he ventured to make\r\nno guess;—assuming all this (which is quite true, although he had no\r\nlogical right to its assumption) Laplace has shown, dynamically and\r\nmathematically, that the results in such case necessarily ensuing, are\r\nthose and those alone which we find manifested in the actually existing\r\ncondition of the system itself.\r\n\r\nTo explain:—Let us conceive _that_ particular agglomeration of which we\r\nhave just spoken—the one at the point designated by our Sun’s centre—to\r\nhave so far proceeded that a vast quantity of nebulous matter has here\r\nassumed a roughly globular form; its centre being, of course, coincident\r\nwith what is now, or rather was originally, the centre of our Sun; and\r\nits periphery extending out beyond the orbit of Neptune, the most remote\r\nof our planets:—in other words, let us suppose the diameter of this\r\nrough sphere to be some 6000 millions of miles. For ages, this mass of\r\nmatter has been undergoing condensation, until at length it has become\r\nreduced into the bulk we imagine; having proceeded gradually, of course,\r\nfrom its atomic and imperceptible state, into what we understand of\r\nvisible, palpable, or otherwise appreciable nebulosity.\r\n\r\nNow, the condition of this mass implies a rotation about an imaginary\r\naxis—a rotation which, commencing with the absolute incipiency of the\r\naggregation, has been ever since acquiring velocity. The very first two\r\natoms which met, approaching each other from points not diametrically\r\nopposite, would, in rushing partially past each other, form a nucleus\r\nfor the rotary movement described. How this would increase in velocity,\r\nis readily seen. The two atoms are joined by others:—an aggregation is\r\nformed. The mass continues to rotate while condensing. But any atom at\r\nthe circumference has, of course, a more rapid motion than one nearer\r\nthe centre. The outer atom, however, with its superior velocity,\r\napproaches the centre; carrying this superior velocity with it as it\r\ngoes. Thus every atom, proceeding inwardly, and finally attaching itself\r\nto the condensed centre, adds something to the original velocity of that\r\ncentre—that is to say, increases the rotary movement of the mass.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose this mass so far condensed that it occupies\r\n_precisely_ the space circumscribed by the orbit of Neptune, and that\r\nthe velocity with which the surface of the mass moves, in the general\r\nrotation, is precisely that velocity with which Neptune now revolves\r\nabout the Sun. At this epoch, then, we are to understand that the\r\nconstantly increasing centrifugal force, having gotten the better of the\r\nnon-increasing centripetal, loosened and separated the exterior and\r\nleast condensed stratum, or a few of the exterior and least condensed\r\nstrata, at the equator of the sphere, where the tangential velocity\r\npredominated; so that these strata formed about the main body an\r\nindependent ring encircling the equatorial regions:—just as the exterior\r\nportion thrown off, by excessive velocity of rotation, from a\r\ngrindstone, would form a ring about the grindstone, but for the solidity\r\nof the superficial material: were this caoutchouc, or anything similar\r\nin consistency, precisely the phænomenon I describe would be presented.\r\n\r\nThe ring thus whirled from the nebulous mass, _revolved_, of course,\r\n_as_ a separate ring, with just that velocity with which, while the\r\nsurface of the mass, it _rotated_. In the meantime, condensation still\r\nproceeding, the interval between the discharged ring and the main body\r\ncontinued to increase, until the former was left at a vast distance from\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nNow, admitting the ring to have possessed, by some seemingly accidental\r\narrangement of its heterogeneous materials, a constitution nearly\r\nuniform, then this ring, _as_ such, would never have ceased revolving\r\nabout its primary; but, as might have been anticipated, there appears to\r\nhave been enough irregularity in the disposition of the materials, to\r\nmake them cluster about centres of superior solidity; and thus the\r\nannular form was destroyed.[5] No doubt, the band was soon broken up\r\ninto several portions, and one of these portions, predominating in mass,\r\nabsorbed the others into itself; the whole settling, spherically, into a\r\nplanet. That this latter, _as_ a planet, continued the revolutionary\r\nmovement which characterized it while a ring, is sufficiently clear; and\r\nthat it took upon itself also, an additional movement in its new\r\ncondition of sphere, is readily explained. The ring being understood as\r\nyet unbroken, we see that its exterior, while the whole revolves about\r\nthe parent body, moves more rapidly than its interior. When the rupture\r\noccurred, then, some portion in each fragment must have been moving\r\nwith greater velocity than the others. The superior movement prevailing,\r\nmust have whirled each fragment round—that is to say, have caused it to\r\nrotate; and the direction of the rotation must, of course, have been the\r\ndirection of the revolution whence it arose. _All_ the fragments having\r\nbecome subject to the rotation described, must, in coalescing, have\r\nimparted it to the one planet constituted by their coalescence.—This\r\nplanet was Neptune. Its material continuing to undergo condensation, and\r\nthe centrifugal force generated in its rotation getting, at length, the\r\nbetter of the centripetal, as before in the case of the parent orb, a\r\nring was whirled also from the equatorial surface of this planet: this\r\nring, having been ununiform in its constitution, was broken up, and its\r\nseveral fragments, being absorbed by the most massive, were collectively\r\nspherified into a moon. Subsequently, the operation was repeated, and a\r\nsecond moon was the result. We thus account for the planet Neptune, with\r\nthe two satellites which accompany him.\r\n\r\n    [5] Laplace assumed his nebulosity heterogeneous, merely that\r\n    he might be thus enabled to account for the breaking up of the\r\n    rings; for had the nebulosity been homogeneous, they would not\r\n    have broken. I reach the same result—heterogeneity of the\r\n    secondary masses immediately resulting from the atoms—purely\r\n    from an _à priori_ consideration of their general\r\n    design—_Relation_.\r\n\r\nIn throwing off a ring from its equator, the Sun re-established that\r\nequilibrium between its centripetal and centrifugal forces which had\r\nbeen disturbed in the process of condensation; but, as this condensation\r\nstill proceeded, the equilibrium was again immediately disturbed,\r\nthrough the increase of rotation. By the time the mass had so far shrunk\r\nthat it occupied a spherical space just that circumscribed by the orbit\r\nof Uranus, we are to understand that the centrifugal force had so far\r\nobtained the ascendency that new relief was needed: a second equatorial\r\nband was, consequently, thrown off, which, proving ununiform, was\r\nbroken up, as before in the case of Neptune; the fragments settling into\r\nthe planet Uranus; the velocity of whose actual revolution about the Sun\r\nindicates, of course, the rotary speed of that Sun’s equatorial surface\r\nat the moment of the separation. Uranus, adopting a rotation from the\r\ncollective rotations of the fragments composing it, as previously\r\nexplained, now threw off ring after ring; each of which, becoming broken\r\nup, settled into a moon:—three moons, at different epochs, having been\r\nformed, in this manner, by the rupture and general spherification of as\r\nmany distinct ununiform rings.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Sun had shrunk until it occupied a space just that\r\ncircumscribed by the orbit of Saturn, the balance, we are to suppose,\r\nbetween its centripetal and centrifugal forces had again become so far\r\ndisturbed, through increase of rotary velocity, the result of\r\ncondensation, that a third effort at equilibrium became necessary; and\r\nan annular band was therefore whirled off as twice before; which, on\r\nrupture through ununiformity, became consolidated into the planet\r\nSaturn. This latter threw off, in the first place, seven uniform bands,\r\nwhich, on rupture, were spherified respectively into as many moons; but,\r\nsubsequently, it appears to have discharged, at three distinct but not\r\nvery distant epochs, three rings whose equability of constitution was,\r\nby apparent accident, so considerable as to present no occasion for\r\ntheir rupture; thus they continue to revolve as rings. I use the phrase\r\n“_apparent_ accident;” for of accident in the ordinary sense there was,\r\nof course, nothing:—the term is properly applied only to the result of\r\nindistinguishable or not immediately traceable _law_.\r\n\r\nShrinking still farther, until it occupied just the space circumscribed\r\nby the orbit of Jupiter, the Sun now found need of farther effort to\r\nrestore the counterbalance of its two forces, continually disarranged in\r\nthe still continued increase of rotation. Jupiter, accordingly, was now\r\nthrown off; passing from the annular to the planetary condition; and, on\r\nattaining this latter, threw off in its turn, at four different epochs,\r\nfour rings, which finally resolved themselves into so many moons.\r\n\r\nStill shrinking, until its sphere occupied just the space defined by the\r\norbit of the Asteroids, the Sun now discarded a ring which appears to\r\nhave had _eight_ centres of superior solidity, and, on breaking up, to\r\nhave separated into eight fragments no one of which so far predominated\r\nin mass as to absorb the others. All therefore, as distinct although\r\ncomparatively small planets, proceeded to revolve in orbits whose\r\ndistances, each from each, may be considered as in some degree the\r\nmeasure of the force which drove them asunder:—all the orbits,\r\nnevertheless, being so closely coincident as to admit of our calling\r\nthem _one_, in view of the other planetary orbits.\r\n\r\nContinuing to shrink, the Sun, on becoming so small as just to fill the\r\norbit of Mars, now discharged this planet—of course by the process\r\nrepeatedly described. Having no moon, however, Mars could have thrown\r\noff no ring. In fact, an epoch had now arrived in the career of the\r\nparent body, the centre of the system. The _de_crease of its nebulosity,\r\nwhich is the _in_crease of its density, and which again is the\r\n_de_crease of its condensation, out of which latter arose the constant\r\ndisturbance of equilibrium—must, by this period, have attained a point\r\nat which the efforts for restoration would have been more and more\r\nineffectual just in proportion as they were less frequently needed. Thus\r\nthe processes of which we have been speaking would everywhere show signs\r\nof exhaustion—in the planets, first, and secondly, in the original mass.\r\nWe must not fall into the error of supposing the decrease of interval\r\nobserved among the planets as we approach the Sun, to be in any respect\r\nindicative of an increase of frequency in the periods at which they were\r\ndiscarded. Exactly the converse is to be understood. The longest\r\ninterval of time must have occurred between the discharges of the two\r\ninterior; the shortest, between those of the two exterior, planets. The\r\ndecrease of the interval of space is, nevertheless, the measure of the\r\ndensity, and thus inversely of the condensation, of the Sun, throughout\r\nthe processes detailed.\r\n\r\nHaving shrunk, however, so far as to fill only the orbit of our Earth,\r\nthe parent sphere whirled from itself still one other body—the Earth—in\r\na condition so nebulous as to admit of this body’s discarding, in its\r\nturn, yet another, which is our Moon;—but here terminated the lunar\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nFinally, subsiding to the orbits first of Venus and then of Mercury, the\r\nSun discarded these two interior planets; neither of which has given\r\nbirth to any moon.\r\n\r\nThus from his original bulk—or, to speak more accurately, from the\r\ncondition in which we first considered him—from a partially spherified\r\nnebular mass, _certainly_ much more than 5,600 millions of miles in\r\ndiameter—the great central orb and origin of our solar-planetary-lunar\r\nsystem, has gradually descended, by condensation, in obedience to the\r\nlaw of Gravity, to a globe only 882,000 miles in diameter; but it by no\r\nmeans follows, either that its condensation is yet complete, or that it\r\nmay not still possess the capacity of whirling from itself another\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nI have here given—in outline of course, but still with all the detail\r\nnecessary for distinctness—a view of the Nebular Theory as its author\r\nhimself conceived it. From whatever point we regard it, we shall find it\r\n_beautifully true_. It is by far too beautiful, indeed, _not_ to possess\r\nTruth as its essentiality—and here I am very profoundly serious in what\r\nI say. In the revolution of the satellites of Uranus, there does appear\r\nsomething seemingly inconsistent with the assumptions of Laplace; but\r\nthat _one_ inconsistency can invalidate a theory constructed from a\r\nmillion of intricate consistencies, is a fancy fit only for the\r\nfantastic. In prophecying, confidently, that the apparent anomaly to\r\nwhich I refer, will, sooner or later, be found one of the strongest\r\npossible corroborations of the general hypothesis, I pretend to no\r\nespecial spirit of divination. It is a matter which the only difficulty\r\nseems _not_ to foresee.[6]\r\n\r\n    [6] I am prepared to show that the anomalous revolution of the\r\n    satellites of Uranus is a simply perspective anomaly arising\r\n    from the inclination of the axis of the planet.\r\n\r\nThe bodies whirled off in the processes described, would exchange, it\r\nhas been seen, the superficial _rotation_ of the orbs whence they\r\noriginated, for a _revolution_ of equal velocity about these orbs as\r\ndistant centres; and the revolution thus engendered must proceed, so\r\nlong as the centripetal force, or that with which the discarded body\r\ngravitates toward its parent, is neither greater nor less than that by\r\nwhich it was discarded; that is, than the centrifugal, or, far more\r\nproperly, than the tangential, velocity. From the unity, however, of the\r\norigin of these two forces, we might have expected to find them as they\r\nare found—the one accurately counterbalancing the other. It has been\r\nshown, indeed, that the act of whirling-off is, in every case, merely an\r\nact for the preservation of the counterbalance.\r\n\r\nAfter referring, however, the centripetal force to the omniprevalent law\r\nof Gravity, it has been the fashion with astronomical treatises, to seek\r\nbeyond the limits of mere Nature—that is to say, of _Secondary_ Cause—a\r\nsolution of the phænomenon of tangential velocity. This latter they\r\nattribute directly to a _First_ Cause—to God. The force which carries a\r\nstellar body around its primary they assert to have originated in an\r\nimpulse given immediately by the finger—this is the childish phraseology\r\nemployed—by the finger of Deity itself. In this view, the planets, fully\r\nformed, are conceived to have been hurled from the Divine hand, to a\r\nposition in the vicinity of the suns, with an impetus mathematically\r\nadapted to the masses, or attractive capacities, of the suns themselves.\r\nAn idea so grossly unphilosophical, although so supinely adopted, could\r\nhave arisen only from the difficulty of otherwise accounting for the\r\nabsolutely accurate adaptation, each to each, of two forces so seemingly\r\nindependent, one of the other, as are the gravitating and tangential.\r\nBut it should be remembered that, for a long time, the coincidence\r\nbetween the moon’s rotation and her sidereal revolution—two matters\r\nseemingly far more independent than those now considered—was looked\r\nupon as positively miraculous; and there was a strong disposition, even\r\namong astronomers, to attribute the marvel to the direct and continual\r\nagency of God—who, in this case, it was said, had found it necessary to\r\ninterpose, specially, among his general laws, a set of subsidiary\r\nregulations, for the purpose of forever concealing from mortal eyes the\r\nglories, or perhaps the horrors, of the other side of the Moon—of that\r\nmysterious hemisphere which has always avoided, and must perpetually\r\navoid, the telescopic scrutiny of mankind. The advance of Science,\r\nhowever, soon demonstrated—what to the philosophical instinct needed\r\n_no_ demonstration—that the one movement is but a portion—something\r\nmore, even, than a consequence—of the other.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I have no patience with fantasies at once so timorous, so\r\nidle, and so awkward. They belong to the veriest _cowardice_ of thought.\r\nThat Nature and the God of Nature are distinct, no thinking being can\r\nlong doubt. By the former we imply merely the laws of the latter. But\r\nwith the very idea of God, omnipotent, omniscient, we entertain, also,\r\nthe idea of _the infallibility_ of his laws. With Him there being\r\nneither Past nor Future—with Him all being _Now_—do we not insult him in\r\nsupposing his laws so contrived as not to provide for every possible\r\ncontingency?—or, rather, what idea _can_ we have of _any_ possible\r\ncontingency, except that it is at once a result and a manifestation of\r\nhis laws? He who, divesting himself of prejudice, shall have the rare\r\ncourage to think absolutely for himself, cannot fail to arrive, in the\r\nend, at the condensation of _laws_ into _Law_—cannot fail of reaching\r\nthe conclusion that _each law of Nature is dependent at all points upon\r\nall other laws_, and that all are but consequences of one primary\r\nexercise of the Divine Volition. Such is the principle of the Cosmogony\r\nwhich, with all necessary deference, I here venture to suggest and to\r\nmaintain.\r\n\r\nIn this view, it will be seen that, dismissing as frivolous, and even\r\nimpious, the fancy of the tangential force having been imparted to the\r\nplanets immediately by “the finger of God,” I consider this force as\r\noriginating in the rotation of the stars:—this rotation as brought about\r\nby the in-rushing of the primary atoms, towards their respective centres\r\nof aggregation:—this in-rushing as the consequence of the law of\r\nGravity:—this law as but the mode in which is necessarily manifested the\r\ntendency of the atoms to return into imparticularity:—this tendency to\r\nreturn as but the inevitable rëaction of the first and most sublime of\r\nActs—that act by which a God, self-existing and alone existing, became\r\nall things at once, through dint of his volition, while all things were\r\nthus constituted a portion of God.\r\n\r\nThe radical assumptions of this Discourse suggest to me, and in fact\r\nimply, certain important _modifications_ of the Nebular Theory as given\r\nby Laplace. The efforts of the repulsive power I have considered as made\r\nfor the purpose of preventing contact among the atoms, and thus as made\r\nin the ratio of the approach to contact—that is to say, in the ratio of\r\ncondensation.[7] In other words, _Electricity_, with its involute\r\nphænomena, heat, light and magnetism, is to be understood as proceeding\r\nas condensation proceeds, and, of course, inversely as density proceeds,\r\nor the _cessation to condense_. Thus the Sun, in the process of its\r\naggregation, must soon, in developing repulsion, have become excessively\r\nheated—perhaps incandescent: and we can perceive how the operation of\r\ndiscarding its rings must have been materially assisted by the slight\r\nincrustation of its surface consequent on cooling. Any common experiment\r\nshows us how readily a crust of the character suggested, is separated,\r\nthrough heterogeneity, from the interior mass. But, on every successive\r\nrejection of the crust, the new surface would appear incandescent as\r\nbefore; and the period at which it would again become so far encrusted\r\nas to be readily loosened and discharged, may well be imagined as\r\nexactly coincident with that at which a new effort would be needed, by\r\nthe whole mass, to restore the equilibrium of its two forces,\r\ndisarranged through condensation. In other words:—by the time the\r\nelectric influence (Repulsion) has prepared the surface for rejection,\r\nwe are to understand that the gravitating influence (Attraction) is\r\nprecisely ready to reject it. Here, then, as everywhere, _the Body and\r\nthe Soul walk hand in hand_.\r\n\r\n    [7] See page 70.\r\n\r\nThese ideas are empirically confirmed at all points. Since condensation\r\ncan never, in any body, be considered as absolutely at an end, we are\r\nwarranted in anticipating that, whenever we have an opportunity of\r\ntesting the matter, we shall find indications of resident luminosity in\r\n_all_ the stellar bodies—moons and planets as well as suns. That our\r\nMoon is strongly self-luminous, we see at her every total eclipse, when,\r\nif not so, she would disappear. On the dark part of the satellite, too,\r\nduring her phases, we often observe flashes like our own Auroras; and\r\nthat these latter, with our various other so-called electrical\r\nphænomena, without reference to any more steady radiance, must give our\r\nEarth a certain appearance of luminosity to an inhabitant of the Moon,\r\nis quite evident. In fact, we should regard all the phænomena referred\r\nto, as mere manifestations, in different moods and degrees, of the\r\nEarth’s feebly-continued condensation.\r\n\r\nIf my views are tenable, we should be prepared to find the newer\r\nplanets—that is to say, those nearer the Sun—more luminous than those\r\nolder and more remote:—and the extreme brilliancy of Venus (on whose\r\ndark portions, during her phases, the Auroras are frequently visible)\r\ndoes not seem to be altogether accounted for by her mere proximity to\r\nthe central orb. She is no doubt vividly self-luminous, although less so\r\nthan Mercury: while the luminosity of Neptune may be comparatively\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nAdmitting what I have urged, it is clear that, from the moment of the\r\nSun’s discarding a ring, there must be a continuous diminution both of\r\nhis heat and light, on account of the continuous encrustation of his\r\nsurface; and that a period would arrive—the period immediately previous\r\nto a new discharge—when a _very material_ decrease of both light and\r\nheat, must become apparent. Now, we know that tokens of such changes are\r\ndistinctly recognizable. On the Melville islands—to adduce merely one\r\nout of a hundred examples—we find traces of _ultra-tropical_\r\nvegetation—of plants that never could have flourished without immensely\r\nmore light and heat than are at present afforded by our Sun to any\r\nportion of the surface of the Earth. Is such vegetation referable to an\r\nepoch immediately subsequent to the whirling-off of Venus? At this epoch\r\nmust have occurred to us our greatest access of solar influence; and,\r\nin fact, this influence must then have attained its maximum:—leaving out\r\nof view, of course, the period when the Earth itself was discarded—the\r\nperiod of its mere organization.\r\n\r\nAgain:—we know that there exist _non-luminous suns_—that is to say, suns\r\nwhose existence we determine through the movements of others, but whose\r\nluminosity is not sufficient to impress us. Are these suns invisible\r\nmerely on account of the length of time elapsed since their discharge of\r\na planet? And yet again:—may we not—at least in certain cases—account\r\nfor the sudden appearances of suns where none had been previously\r\nsuspected, by the hypothesis that, having rolled with encrusted surfaces\r\nthroughout the few thousand years of our astronomical history, each of\r\nthese suns, in whirling off a new secondary, has at length been enabled\r\nto display the glories of its still incandescent interior?—To the\r\nwell-ascertained fact of the proportional increase of heat as we descend\r\ninto the Earth, I need of course, do nothing more than refer:—it comes\r\nin the strongest possible corroboration of all that I have said on the\r\ntopic now at issue.\r\n\r\nIn speaking, not long ago, of the repulsive or electrical influence, I\r\nremarked that “the important phænomena of vitality, consciousness, and\r\nthought, whether we observe them generally or in detail, seem to proceed\r\n_at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous_.”[8] I mentioned, too, that\r\nI would recur to the suggestion:—and this is the proper point at which\r\nto do so. Looking at the matter, first, in detail, we perceive that not\r\nmerely the _manifestation_ of vitality, but its importance, consequence,\r\nand elevation of character, keep pace, very closely, with the\r\nheterogeneity, or complexity, of the animal structure. Looking at the\r\nquestion, now, in its generality, and referring to the first movements\r\nof the atoms towards mass-constitution, we find that heterogeneousness,\r\nbrought about directly through condensation, is proportional with it\r\nforever. We thus reach the proposition that _the importance of the\r\ndevelopment of the terrestrial vitality proceeds equably with the\r\nterrestrial condensation_.\r\n\r\n    [8] Page 36.\r\n\r\nNow this is in precise accordance with what we know of the succession of\r\nanimals on the Earth. As it has proceeded in its condensation, superior\r\nand still superior races have appeared. Is it impossible that the\r\nsuccessive geological revolutions which have attended, at least, if not\r\nimmediately caused, these successive elevations of vitalic character—is\r\nit improbable that these revolutions have themselves been produced by\r\nthe successive planetary discharges from the Sun—in other words, by the\r\nsuccessive variations in the solar influence on the Earth? Were this\r\nidea tenable, we should not be unwarranted in the fancy that the\r\ndischarge of yet a new planet, interior to Mercury, may give rise to yet\r\na new modification of the terrestrial surface—a modification from which\r\nmay spring a race both materially and spiritually superior to Man. These\r\nthoughts impress me with all the force of truth—but I throw them out, of\r\ncourse, merely in their obvious character of suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe Nebular Theory of Laplace has lately received far more confirmation\r\nthan it needed, at the hands of the philosopher, Compte. These two have\r\nthus together shown—_not_, to be sure, that Matter at any period\r\nactually existed as described, in a state of nebular diffusion, but\r\nthat, admitting it so to have existed throughout the space and much\r\nbeyond the space now occupied by our solar system, _and to have\r\ncommenced a movement towards a centre_—it must gradually have assumed\r\nthe various forms and motions which are now seen, in that system, to\r\nobtain. A demonstration such as this—a dynamical and mathematical\r\ndemonstration, as far as demonstration can be—unquestionable and\r\nunquestioned—unless, indeed, by that unprofitable and disreputable\r\ntribe, the professional questioners—the mere madmen who deny the\r\nNewtonian law of Gravity on which the results of the French\r\nmathematicians are based—a demonstration, I say, such as this, would to\r\nmost intellects be conclusive—and I confess that it is so to mine—of the\r\nvalidity of the nebular hypothesis upon which the demonstration depends.\r\n\r\nThat the demonstration does not _prove_ the hypothesis, according to the\r\ncommon understanding of the word “proof,” I admit, of course. To show\r\nthat certain existing results—that certain established facts—may be,\r\neven mathematically, accounted for by the assumption of a certain\r\nhypothesis, is by no means to establish the hypothesis itself. In other\r\nwords:—to show that, certain data being given, a certain existing result\r\nmight, or even _must_, have ensued, will fail to prove that this result\r\n_did_ ensue, _from the data_, until such time as it shall be also shown\r\nthat there are, _and can be_, no other data from which the result in\r\nquestion might _equally_ have ensued. But, in the case now discussed,\r\nalthough all must admit the deficiency of what we are in the habit of\r\nterming “proof,” still there are many intellects, and those of the\r\nloftiest order, to which _no_ proof could bring one iota of additional\r\n_conviction_. Without going into details which might impinge upon the\r\nCloud-Land of Metaphysics, I may as well here observe that the force of\r\nconviction, in cases such as this, will always, with the right-thinking,\r\nbe proportional to the amount of _complexity_ intervening between the\r\nhypothesis and the result. To be less abstract:—The greatness of the\r\ncomplexity found existing among cosmical conditions, by rendering great\r\nin the same proportion the difficulty of accounting for all these\r\nconditions _at once_, strengthens, also in the same proportion, our\r\nfaith in that hypothesis which does, in such manner, satisfactorily\r\naccount for them:—and as _no_ complexity can well be conceived greater\r\nthan that of the astronomical conditions, so no conviction can be\r\nstronger—to _my_ mind at least—than that with which I am impressed by an\r\nhypothesis that not only reconciles these conditions, with mathematical\r\naccuracy, and reduces them into a consistent and intelligible whole, but\r\nis, at the same time, the _sole_ hypothesis by means of which the human\r\nintellect has been ever enabled to account for them _at all_.\r\n\r\nA most unfounded opinion has become latterly current in gossiping and\r\neven in scientific circles—the opinion that the so-called Nebular\r\nCosmogony has been overthrown. This fancy has arisen from the report of\r\nlate observations made, among what hitherto have been termed the\r\n“nebulæ,” through the large telescope of Cincinnati, and the\r\nworld-renowned instrument of Lord Rosse. Certain spots in the firmament\r\nwhich presented, even to the most powerful of the old telescopes, the\r\nappearance of nebulosity, or haze, had been regarded for a long time as\r\nconfirming the theory of Laplace. They were looked upon as stars in that\r\nvery process of condensation which I have been attempting to describe.\r\nThus it was supposed that we “had ocular evidence”—an evidence, by the\r\nway, which has always been found very questionable—of the truth of the\r\nhypothesis; and, although certain telescopic improvements, every now and\r\nthen, enabled us to perceive that a spot, here and there, which we had\r\nbeen classing among the nebulæ, was, in fact, but a cluster of stars\r\nderiving its nebular character only from its immensity of distance—still\r\nit was thought that no doubt could exist as to the actual nebulosity of\r\nnumerous other masses, the strong-holds of the nebulists, bidding\r\ndefiance to every effort at segregation. Of these latter the most\r\ninteresting was the great “nebulæ” in the constellation Orion:—but this,\r\nwith innumerable other mis-called “nebulæ,” when viewed through the\r\nmagnificent modern telescopes, has become resolved into a simple\r\ncollection of stars. Now this fact has been very generally understood as\r\nconclusive against the Nebular Hypothesis of Laplace; and, on\r\nannouncement of the discoveries in question, the most enthusiastic\r\ndefender and most eloquent popularizer of the theory, Dr. Nichol, went\r\nso far as to “admit the necessity of abandoning” an idea which had\r\nformed the material of his most praiseworthy book.[9]\r\n\r\n    [9] “_Views of the Architecture of the Heavens._” A letter,\r\n    purporting to be from Dr. Nichol to a friend in America, went\r\n    the rounds of our newspapers, about two years ago, I think,\r\n    admitting “the necessity” to which I refer. In a subsequent\r\n    Lecture, however, Dr. N. appears in some manner to have gotten\r\n    the better of the necessity, and does not quite _renounce_ the\r\n    theory, although he seems to wish that he could sneer at it as\r\n    “a purely hypothetical one.” What else was the Law of Gravity\r\n    before the Maskelyne experiments? and who questioned the Law of\r\n    Gravity, even then?\r\n\r\nMany of my readers will no doubt be inclined to say that the result of\r\nthese new investigations _has_ at least a strong _tendency_ to overthrow\r\nthe hypothesis; while some of them, more thoughtful, will suggest that,\r\nalthough the theory is by no means disproved through the segregation of\r\nthe particular “nebulæ,” alluded to, still a _failure_ to segregate\r\nthem, with such telescopes, might well have been understood as a\r\ntriumphant _corroboration_ of the theory:—and this latter class will be\r\nsurprised, perhaps, to hear me say that even with _them_ I disagree. If\r\nthe propositions of this Discourse have been comprehended, it will be\r\nseen that, in my view, a failure to segregate the “nebulæ” would have\r\ntended to the refutation, rather than to the confirmation, of the\r\nNebular Hypothesis.\r\n\r\nLet me explain:—The Newtonian Law of Gravity we may, of course, assume\r\nas demonstrated. This law, it will be remembered, I have referred to the\r\nrëaction of the first Divine Act—to the rëaction of an exercise of the\r\nDivine Volition temporarily overcoming a difficulty. This difficulty is\r\nthat of forcing the normal into the abnormal—of impelling that whose\r\noriginality, and therefore whose rightful condition, was _One_, to take\r\nupon itself the wrongful condition of _Many_. It is only by conceiving\r\nthis difficulty as _temporarily_ overcome, that we can comprehend a\r\nrëaction. There could have been no rëaction had the act been infinitely\r\ncontinued. So long as the act _lasted_, no rëaction, of course, could\r\ncommence; in other words, no _gravitation_ could take place—for we have\r\nconsidered the one as but the manifestation of the other. But\r\ngravitation _has_ taken place; therefore the act of Creation has ceased:\r\nand gravitation has long ago taken place; therefore the act of Creation\r\nhas long ago ceased. We can no more expect, then, to observe _the\r\nprimary processes_ of Creation; and to these primary processes the\r\ncondition of nebulosity has already been explained to belong.\r\n\r\nThrough what we know of the propagation of light, we have direct proof\r\nthat the more remote of the stars have existed, under the forms in which\r\nwe now see them, for an inconceivable number of years. So far back _at\r\nleast_, then, as the period when these stars underwent condensation,\r\nmust have been the epoch at which the mass-constitutive processes began.\r\nThat we may conceive these processes, then, as still going on in the\r\ncase of certain “nebulæ,” while in all other cases we find them\r\nthoroughly at an end, we are forced into assumptions for which we have\r\nreally _no_ basis whatever—we have to thrust in, again, upon the\r\nrevolting Reason, the blasphemous idea of special interposition—we have\r\nto suppose that, in the particular instances of these “nebulæ,” an\r\nunerring God found it necessary to introduce certain supplementary\r\nregulations—certain improvements of the general law—certain retouchings\r\nand emendations, in a word, which had the effect of deferring the\r\ncompletion of these individual stars for centuries of centuries beyond\r\nthe æra during which all the other stellar bodies had time, not only to\r\nbe fully constituted, but to grow hoary with an unspeakable old age.\r\n\r\nOf course, it will be immediately objected that since the light by which\r\nwe recognize the nebulæ now, must be merely that which left their\r\nsurfaces a vast number of years ago, the processes at present observed,\r\nor supposed to be observed, are, in fact, _not_ processes now actually\r\ngoing on, but the phantoms of processes completed long in the Past—just\r\nas I maintain all these mass-constitutive processes _must_ have been.\r\n\r\nTo this I reply that neither is the now-observed condition of the\r\ncondensed stars their actual condition, but a condition completed long\r\nin the Past; so that my argument drawn from the _relative_ condition of\r\nthe stars and the “nebulæ,” is in no manner disturbed. Moreover, those\r\nwho maintain the existence of nebulæ, do _not_ refer the nebulosity to\r\nextreme distance; they declare it a real and not merely a perspective\r\nnebulosity. That we may conceive, indeed, a nebular mass as visible at\r\nall, we must conceive it as _very near us_ in comparison with the\r\ncondensed stars brought into view by the modern telescopes. In\r\nmaintaining the appearances in question, then, to be really nebulous, we\r\nmaintain their comparative vicinity to our point of view. Thus, their\r\ncondition, as we see them now, must be referred to an epoch _far less\r\nremote_ than that to which we may refer the now-observed condition of at\r\nleast the majority of the stars.—In a word, should Astronomy ever\r\ndemonstrate a “nebula,” in the sense at present intended, I should\r\nconsider the Nebular Cosmogony—_not_, indeed, as corroborated by the\r\ndemonstration—but as thereby irretrievably overthrown.\r\n\r\nBy way, however, of rendering unto Cæsar _no more_ than the things that\r\nare Cæsar’s, let me here remark that the assumption of the hypothesis\r\nwhich led him to so glorious a result, seems to have been suggested to\r\nLaplace in great measure by a misconception—by the very misconception of\r\nwhich we have just been speaking—by the generally prevalent\r\nmisunderstanding of the character of the nebulæ, so mis-named. These he\r\nsupposed to be, in reality, what their designation implies. The fact is,\r\nthis great man had, very properly, an inferior faith in his own merely\r\n_perceptive_ powers. In respect, therefore, to the actual existence of\r\nnebulæ—an existence so confidently maintained by his telescopic\r\ncontemporaries—he depended less upon what he saw than upon what he\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the only valid objections to his theory, are those\r\nmade to its hypothesis _as_ such—to what suggested it—not to what it\r\nsuggests; to its propositions rather than to its results. His most\r\nunwarranted assumption was that of giving the atoms a movement towards a\r\ncentre, in the very face of his evident understanding that these atoms,\r\nin unlimited succession, extended throughout the Universal space. I have\r\nalready shown that, under such circumstances, there could have occurred\r\nno movement at all; and Laplace, consequently, assumed one on no more\r\nphilosophical ground than that something of the kind was necessary for\r\nthe establishment of what he intended to establish.\r\n\r\nHis original idea seems to have been a compound of the true Epicurean\r\natoms with the false nebulæ of his contemporaries; and thus his theory\r\npresents us with the singular anomaly of absolute truth deduced, as a\r\nmathematical result, from a hybrid datum of ancient imagination\r\nintertangled with modern inacumen. Laplace’s real strength lay, in fact,\r\nin an almost miraculous mathematical instinct:—on this he relied; and in\r\nno instance did it fail or deceive him:—in the case of the Nebular\r\nCosmogony, it led him, blindfolded, through a labyrinth of Error, into\r\none of the most luminous and stupendous temples of Truth.\r\n\r\nLet us now fancy, for the moment, that the ring first thrown off by the\r\nSun—that is to say, the ring whose breaking-up constituted Neptune—did\r\nnot, in fact, break up until the throwing-off of the ring out of which\r\nUranus arose; that this latter ring, again, remained perfect until the\r\ndischarge of that out of which sprang Saturn; that this latter, again,\r\nremained entire until the discharge of that from which originated\r\nJupiter—and so on. Let us imagine, in a word, that no dissolution\r\noccurred among the rings until the final rejection of that which gave\r\nbirth to Mercury. We thus paint to the eye of the mind a series of\r\ncöexistent concentric circles; and looking as well at _them_ as at the\r\nprocesses by which, according to Laplace’s hypothesis, they were\r\nconstructed, we perceive at once a very singular analogy with the atomic\r\nstrata and the process of the original irradiation as I have described\r\nit. Is it impossible that, on measuring the _forces_, respectively, by\r\nwhich each successive planetary circle was thrown off—that is to say, on\r\nmeasuring the successive excesses of rotation over gravitation which\r\noccasioned the successive discharges—we should find the analogy in\r\nquestion more decidedly confirmed? _Is it improbable that we should\r\ndiscover these forces to have varied—as in the original\r\nradiation—proportionally to the squares of the distances?_\r\n\r\nOur solar system, consisting, in chief, of one sun, with sixteen planets\r\ncertainly, and possibly a few more, revolving about it at various\r\ndistances, and attended by seventeen moons assuredly, but _very_\r\nprobably by several others—is now to be considered as _an example_ of\r\nthe innumerable agglomerations which proceeded to take place throughout\r\nthe Universal Sphere of atoms on withdrawal of the Divine Volition. I\r\nmean to say that our solar system is to be understood as affording a\r\n_generic instance_ of these agglomerations, or, more correctly, of the\r\nulterior conditions at which they arrived. If we keep our attention\r\nfixed on the idea of _the utmost possible Relation_ as the Omnipotent\r\ndesign, and on the precautions taken to accomplish it through difference\r\nof form, among the original atoms, and particular inequidistance, we\r\nshall find it impossible to suppose for a moment that even any two of\r\nthe incipient agglomerations reached precisely the same result in the\r\nend. We shall rather be inclined to think that _no two_ stellar bodies\r\nin the Universe—whether suns, planets or moons—are particularly, while\r\n_all_ are generally, similar. Still less, then, can we imagine any two\r\n_assemblages_ of such bodies—any two “systems”—as having more than a\r\ngeneral resemblance.[10] Our telescopes, at this point, thoroughly\r\nconfirm our deductions. Taking our own solar system, then, as merely a\r\nloose or general type of all, we have so far proceeded in our subject as\r\nto survey the Universe under the aspect of a spherical space, throughout\r\nwhich, dispersed with merely general equability, exist a number of but\r\ngenerally similar _systems_.\r\n\r\n    [10] It is not _impossible_ that some unlooked-for optical\r\n    improvement may disclose to us, among innumerable varieties of\r\n    systems, a luminous sun, encircled by luminous and non-luminous\r\n    rings, within and without and between which, revolve luminous\r\n    and non-luminous planets, attended by moons having moons—and\r\n    even these latter again having moons.\r\n\r\nLet us now, expanding our conceptions, look upon each of these systems\r\nas in itself an atom; which in fact it is, when we consider it as but\r\none of the countless myriads of systems which constitute the Universe.\r\nRegarding all, then, as but colossal atoms, each with the same\r\nineradicable tendency to Unity which characterizes the actual atoms of\r\nwhich it consists—we enter at once upon a new order of aggregations. The\r\nsmaller systems, in the vicinity of a larger one, would, inevitably, be\r\ndrawn into still closer vicinity. A thousand would assemble here; a\r\nmillion there—perhaps here, again, even a billion—leaving, thus,\r\nimmeasurable vacancies in space. And if now, it be demanded why, in the\r\ncase of these systems—of these merely Titanic atoms—I speak, simply, of\r\nan “assemblage,” and not, as in the case of the actual atoms, of a more\r\nor less consolidated agglomeration:—if it be asked, for instance, why I\r\ndo not carry what I suggest to its legitimate conclusion, and describe,\r\nat once, these assemblages of system-atoms as rushing to consolidation\r\nin spheres—as each becoming condensed into one magnificent sun—my reply\r\nis that μελλοντα ταυτα—I am but pausing, for a moment, on the awful\r\nthreshold of _the Future_. For the present, calling these assemblages\r\n“clusters,” we see them in the incipient stages of their consolidation.\r\nTheir _absolute_ consolidation is _to come_.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached a point from which we behold the Universe as a\r\nspherical space, interspersed, _unequably_, with _clusters_. It will be\r\nnoticed that I here prefer the adverb “unequably” to the phrase “with a\r\nmerely general equability,” employed before. It is evident, in fact,\r\nthat the equability of distribution will diminish in the ratio of the\r\nagglomerative processes—that is to say, as the things distributed\r\ndiminish in number. Thus the increase of _in_-equability—an increase\r\nwhich must continue until, sooner or later, an epoch will arrive at\r\nwhich the largest agglomeration will absorb all the others—should be\r\nviewed as, simply, a corroborative indication of the _tendency to One_.\r\n\r\nAnd here, at length, it seems proper to inquire whether the ascertained\r\n_facts_ of Astronomy confirm the general arrangement which I have thus,\r\ndeductively, assigned to the Heavens. Thoroughly, they _do_. Telescopic\r\nobservation, guided by the laws of perspective, enables us to understand\r\nthat the perceptible Universe exists as _a cluster of clusters,\r\nirregularly disposed_.\r\n\r\nThe “clusters” of which this Universal “_cluster of clusters_” consists,\r\nare merely what we have been in the practice of designating\r\n“nebulæ”—and, of these “nebulæ,” _one_ is of paramount interest to\r\nmankind. I allude to the Galaxy, or Milky Way. This interests us, first\r\nand most obviously, on account of its great superiority in apparent\r\nsize, not only to any one other cluster in the firmament, but to all the\r\nother clusters taken together. The largest of these latter occupies a\r\nmere point, comparatively, and is distinctly seen only with the aid of a\r\ntelescope. The Galaxy sweeps throughout the Heaven and is brilliantly\r\nvisible to the naked eye. But it interests man chiefly, although less\r\nimmediately, on account of its being his home; the home of the Earth on\r\nwhich he exists; the home of the Sun about which this Earth revolves;\r\nthe home of that “system” of orbs of which the Sun is the centre and\r\nprimary—the Earth one of sixteen secondaries, or planets—the Moon one of\r\nseventeen tertiaries, or satellites. The Galaxy, let me repeat, is but\r\none of the _clusters_ which I have been describing—but one of the\r\nmis-called “nebulæ” revealed to us—by the telescope alone, sometimes—as\r\nfaint hazy spots in various quarters of the sky. We have no reason to\r\nsuppose the Milky Way _really_ more extensive than the least of these\r\n“nebulæ.” Its vast superiority in size is but an apparent superiority\r\narising from our position in regard to it—that is to say, from our\r\nposition in its midst. However strange the assertion may at first appear\r\nto those unversed in Astronomy, still the astronomer himself has no\r\nhesitation in asserting that we are _in the midst_ of that inconceivable\r\nhost of stars—of suns—of systems—which constitute the Galaxy. Moreover,\r\nnot only have _we_—not only has _our_ Sun a right to claim the Galaxy as\r\nits own especial cluster, but, with slight reservation, it may be said\r\nthat all the distinctly visible stars of the firmament—all the stars\r\nVisible to the naked eye—have equally a right to claim it as _their_\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great deal of misconception in respect to the _shape_\r\nof the Galaxy; which, in nearly all our astronomical treatises, is said\r\nto resemble that of a capital Y. The cluster in question has, in\r\nreality, a certain general—_very_ general resemblance to the planet\r\nSaturn, with its encompassing triple ring. Instead of the solid orb of\r\nthat planet, however, we must picture to ourselves a lenticular\r\nstar-island, or collection of stars; our Sun lying excentrically—near\r\nthe shore of the island—on that side of it which is nearest the\r\nconstellation of the Cross and farthest from that of Cassiopeia. The\r\nsurrounding ring, where it approaches our position, has in it a\r\nlongitudinal _gash_, which does, in fact, cause _the ring, in our\r\nvicinity_, to assume, loosely, the appearance of a capital Y.\r\n\r\nWe must not fall into the error, however, of conceiving the somewhat\r\nindefinite girdle as at all _remote_, comparatively speaking, from the\r\nalso indefinite lenticular cluster which it surrounds; and thus, for\r\nmere purpose of explanation, we may speak of our Sun as actually\r\nsituated at that point of the Y where its three component lines unite;\r\nand, conceiving this letter to be of a certain solidity—of a certain\r\nthickness, very trivial in comparison with its length—we may even speak\r\nof our position as _in the middle_ of this thickness. Fancying ourselves\r\nthus placed, we shall no longer find difficulty in accounting for the\r\nphænomena presented—which are perspective altogether. When we look\r\nupward or downward—that is to say, when we cast our eyes in the\r\ndirection of the letter’s _thickness_—we look through fewer stars than\r\nwhen we cast them in the direction of its _length_, or _along_ either of\r\nthe three component lines. Of course, in the former case, the stars\r\nappear scattered—in the latter, crowded.—To reverse this explanation:—An\r\ninhabitant of the Earth, when looking, as we commonly express ourselves,\r\n_at_ the Galaxy, is then beholding it in some of the directions of its\r\nlength—is looking _along_ the lines of the Y—but when, looking out into\r\nthe general Heaven, he turns his eyes _from_ the Galaxy, he is then\r\nsurveying it in the direction of the letter’s thickness; and on this\r\naccount the stars seem to him scattered; while, in fact, they are as\r\nclose together, on an average, as in the mass of the cluster. _No_\r\nconsideration could be better adapted to convey an idea of this\r\ncluster’s stupendous extent.\r\n\r\nIf, with a telescope of high space-penetrating power, we carefully\r\ninspect the firmament, we shall become aware of _a belt of clusters_—of\r\nwhat we have hitherto called “nebulæ”—a _band_, of varying breadth,\r\nstretching from horizon to horizon, at right angles to the general\r\ncourse of the Milky Way. This band is the ultimate _cluster of\r\nclusters_. This belt is _The Universe_. Our Galaxy is but one, and\r\nperhaps one of the most inconsiderable, of the clusters which go to the\r\nconstitution of this ultimate, Universal _belt_ or _band_. The\r\nappearance of this cluster of clusters, to our eyes, _as_ a belt or\r\nband, is altogether a perspective phænomenon of the same character as\r\nthat which causes us to behold our own individual and roughly-spherical\r\ncluster, the Galaxy, under guise also of a belt, traversing the Heavens\r\nat right angles to the Universal one. The shape of the all-inclusive\r\ncluster is, of course _generally_, that of each individual cluster which\r\nit includes. Just as the scattered stars which, on looking _from_ the\r\nGalaxy, we see in the general sky, are, in fact, but a portion of that\r\nGalaxy itself, and as closely intermingled with it as any of the\r\ntelescopic points in what seems the densest portion of its mass—so are\r\nthe scattered “nebulæ” which, on casting our eyes _from_ the Universal\r\n_belt_, we perceive at all points of the firmament—so, I say, are these\r\nscattered “nebulæ” to be understood as only perspectively scattered, and\r\nas part and parcel of the one supreme and Universal _sphere_.\r\n\r\nNo astronomical fallacy is more untenable, and none has been more\r\npertinaciously adhered to, than that of the absolute _illimitation_ of\r\nthe Universe of Stars. The reasons for limitation, as I have already\r\nassigned them, _à priori_, seem to me unanswerable; but, not to speak of\r\nthese, _observation_ assures us that there is, in numerous directions\r\naround us, certainly, if not in all, a positive limit—or, at the very\r\nleast, affords us no basis whatever for thinking otherwise. Were the\r\nsuccession of stars endless, then the background of the sky would\r\npresent us an uniform luminosity, like that displayed by the\r\nGalaxy—_since there could be absolutely no point, in all that\r\nbackground, at which would not exist a star._ The only mode, therefore,\r\nin which, under such a state of affairs, we could comprehend the _voids_\r\nwhich our telescopes find in innumerable directions, would be by\r\nsupposing the distance of the invisible background so immense that no\r\nray from it has yet been able to reach us at all. That this _may_ be so,\r\nwho shall venture to deny? I maintain, simply, that we have not even the\r\nshadow of a reason for believing that it _is_ so.\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of the vulgar propensity to regard all bodies on the Earth\r\nas tending merely to the Earth’s centre, I observed that, “with certain\r\nexceptions to be specified hereafter, every body on the Earth tended not\r\nonly to the Earth’s centre, but in every conceivable direction\r\nbesides.”[11] The “exceptions” refer to those frequent gaps in the\r\nHeavens, where our utmost scrutiny can detect not only no stellar\r\nbodies, but no indications of their existence:—where yawning chasms,\r\nblacker than Erebus, seem to afford us glimpses, through the boundary\r\nwalls of the Universe of Stars, into the illimitable Universe of\r\nVacancy, beyond. Now as any body, existing on the Earth, chances to\r\npass, either through its own movement or the Earth’s, into a line with\r\nany one of these voids, or cosmical abysses, it clearly is no longer\r\nattracted _in the direction of that void_, and for the moment,\r\nconsequently, is “heavier” than at any period, either after or before.\r\nIndependently of the consideration of these voids, however, and looking\r\nonly at the generally unequable distribution of the stars, we see that\r\nthe absolute tendency of bodies on the Earth to the Earth’s centre, is\r\nin a state of perpetual variation.\r\n\r\n    [11] Page 62.\r\n\r\nWe comprehend, then, the insulation of our Universe. We perceive the\r\nisolation of _that_—of _all_ that which we grasp with the senses. We\r\nknow that there exists one _cluster of clusters_—a collection around\r\nwhich, on all sides, extend the immeasurable wildernesses of a Space _to\r\nall human perception_ untenanted. But _because_ upon the confines of\r\nthis Universe of Stars we are compelled to pause, through want of\r\nfarther evidence from the senses, is it right to conclude that, in fact,\r\nthere _is_ no material point beyond that which we have thus been\r\npermitted to attain? Have we, or have we not, an analogical right to the\r\ninference that this perceptible Universe—that this cluster of\r\nclusters—is but one of _a series_ of clusters of clusters, the rest of\r\nwhich are invisible through distance—through the diffusion of their\r\nlight being so excessive, ere it reaches us, as not to produce upon our\r\nretinas a light-impression—or from there being no such emanation as\r\nlight at all, in these unspeakably distant worlds—or, lastly, from the\r\nmere interval being so vast, that the electric tidings of their presence\r\nin Space, have not yet—through the lapsing myriads of years—been enabled\r\nto traverse that interval?\r\n\r\nHave we any right to inferences—have we any ground whatever for visions\r\nsuch as these? If we have a right to them in _any_ degree, we have a\r\nright to their infinite extension.\r\n\r\nThe human brain has obviously a leaning to the “_Infinite_,” and fondles\r\nthe phantom of the idea. It seems to long with a passionate fervor for\r\nthis impossible conception, with the hope of intellectually believing it\r\nwhen conceived. What is general among the whole race of Man, of course\r\nno individual of that race can be warranted in considering abnormal;\r\nnevertheless, there _may_ be a class of superior intelligences, to whom\r\nthe human bias alluded to may wear all the character of monomania.\r\n\r\nMy question, however, remains unanswered:—Have we any right to infer—let\r\nus say, rather, to imagine—an interminable succession of the “clusters\r\nof clusters,” or of “Universes” more or less similar?\r\n\r\nI reply that the “right,” in a case such as this, depends absolutely\r\nupon the hardihood of that imagination which ventures to claim the\r\nright. Let me declare, only, that, as an individual, I myself feel\r\nimpelled to the _fancy_—without daring to call it more—that there _does_\r\nexist a _limitless_ succession of Universes, more or less similar to\r\nthat of which we have cognizance—to that of which _alone_ we shall ever\r\nhave cognizance—at the very least until the return of our own particular\r\nUniverse into Unity. _If_ such clusters of clusters exist, however—_and\r\nthey do_—it is abundantly clear that, having had no part in our origin,\r\nthey have no portion in our laws. They neither attract us, nor we them.\r\nTheir material—their spirit is not ours—is not that which obtains in any\r\npart of our Universe. They could not impress our senses or our souls.\r\nAmong them and us—considering all, for the moment, collectively—there\r\nare no influences in common. Each exists, apart and independently, _in\r\nthe bosom of its proper and particular God_.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of this Discourse, I am aiming less at physical than at\r\nmetaphysical order. The clearness with which even material phænomena are\r\npresented to the understanding, depends very little, I have long since\r\nlearned to perceive, upon a merely natural, and almost altogether upon a\r\nmoral, arrangement. If then I seem to step somewhat too discursively\r\nfrom point to point of my topic, let me suggest that I do so in the hope\r\nof thus the better keeping unbroken that chain of _graduated impression_\r\nby which alone the intellect of Man can expect to encompass the\r\ngrandeurs of which I speak, and, in their majestic totality, to\r\ncomprehend them.\r\n\r\nSo far, our attention has been directed, almost exclusively, to a\r\ngeneral and relative grouping of the stellar bodies in space. Of\r\nspecification there has been little; and whatever ideas of _quantity_\r\nhave been conveyed—that is to say, of number, magnitude, and\r\ndistance—have been conveyed incidentally and by way of preparation for\r\nmore definitive conceptions. These latter let us now attempt to\r\nentertain.\r\n\r\nOur solar system, as has been already mentioned, consists, in chief, of\r\none sun and sixteen planets certainly, but in all probability a few\r\nothers, revolving around it as a centre, and attended by seventeen moons\r\nof which we know, with possibly several more of which as yet we know\r\nnothing. These various bodies are not true spheres, but oblate\r\nspheroids—spheres flattened at the poles of the imaginary axes about\r\nwhich they rotate:—the flattening being a consequence of the rotation.\r\nNeither is the Sun absolutely the centre of the system; for this Sun\r\nitself, with all the planets, revolves about a perpetually shifting\r\npoint of space, which is the system’s general centre of gravity. Neither\r\nare we to consider the paths through which these different spheroids\r\nmove—the moons about the planets, the planets about the Sun, or the Sun\r\nabout the common centre—as circles in an accurate sense. They are, in\r\nfact, _ellipses—one of the foci being the point about which the\r\nrevolution is made_. An ellipse is a curve, returning into itself, one\r\nof whose diameters is longer than the other. In the longer diameter are\r\ntwo points, equidistant from the middle of the line, and so situated\r\notherwise that if, from each of them a straight line be drawn to any one\r\npoint of the curve, the two lines, taken together, will be equal to the\r\nlonger diameter itself. Now let us conceive such an ellipse. At one of\r\nthe points mentioned, which are the _foci_, let us fasten an orange. By\r\nan elastic thread let us connect this orange with a pea; and let us\r\nplace this latter on the circumference of the ellipse. Let us now move\r\nthe pea continuously around the orange—keeping always on the\r\ncircumference of the ellipse. The elastic thread, which, of course,\r\nvaries in length as we move the pea, will form what in geometry is\r\ncalled a _radius vector_. Now, if the orange be understood as the Sun,\r\nand the pea as a planet revolving about it, then the revolution should\r\nbe made at such a rate—with a velocity so varying—that the _radius\r\nvector_ may pass over _equal areas of space in equal times_. The\r\nprogress of the pea _should be_—in other words, the progress of the\r\nplanet _is_, of course,—slow in proportion to its distance from the\r\nSun—swift in proportion to its proximity. Those planets, moreover, move\r\nthe more slowly which are the farther from the Sun; _the squares of\r\ntheir periods of revolution having the same proportion to each other, as\r\nhave to each other the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun_.\r\n\r\nThe wonderfully complex laws of revolution here described, however, are\r\nnot to be understood as obtaining in our system alone. They _everywhere_\r\nprevail where Attraction prevails. They control _the Universe_. Every\r\nshining speck in the firmament is, no doubt, a luminous sun, resembling\r\nour own, at least in its general features, and having in attendance upon\r\nit a greater or less number of planets, greater or less, whose still\r\nlingering luminosity is not sufficient to render them visible to us at\r\nso vast a distance, but which, nevertheless, revolve, moon-attended,\r\nabout their starry centres, in obedience to the principles just\r\ndetailed—in obedience to the three omniprevalent laws of revolution—the\r\nthree immortal laws _guessed_ by the imaginative Kepler, and but\r\nsubsequently demonstrated and accounted for by the patient and\r\nmathematical Newton. Among a tribe of philosophers who pride themselves\r\nexcessively upon matter-of-fact, it is far too fashionable to sneer at\r\nall speculation under the comprehensive _sobriquet_, “guess-work.” The\r\npoint to be considered is, _who_ guesses. In guessing with Plato, we\r\nspend our time to better purpose, now and then, than in hearkening to a\r\ndemonstration by Alcmæon.\r\n\r\nIn many works on Astronomy I find it distinctly stated that the laws of\r\nKepler are _the basis_ of the great principle, Gravitation. This idea\r\nmust have arisen from the fact that the suggestion of these laws by\r\nKepler, and his proving them _à posteriori_ to have an actual existence,\r\nled Newton to account for them by the hypothesis of Gravitation, and,\r\nfinally, to demonstrate them _à priori_, as necessary consequences of\r\nthe hypothetical principle. Thus so far from the laws of Kepler being\r\nthe basis of Gravity, Gravity is the basis of these laws—as it is,\r\nindeed, of all the laws of the material Universe which are not referable\r\nto Repulsion alone.\r\n\r\nThe mean distance of the Earth from the Moon—that is to say, from the\r\nheavenly body in our closest vicinity—is 237,000 miles. Mercury, the\r\nplanet nearest the Sun, is distant from him 37 millions of miles. Venus,\r\nthe next, revolves at a distance of 68 millions:—the Earth, which comes\r\nnext, at a distance of 95 millions:—Mars, then, at a distance of 144\r\nmillions. Now come the eight Asteroids (Ceres, Juno, Vesta, Pallas,\r\nAstræa, Flora, Iris, and Hebe) at an average distance of about 250\r\nmillions. Then we have Jupiter, distant 490 millions; then Saturn, 900\r\nmillions; then Uranus, 19 hundred millions; finally Neptune, lately\r\ndiscovered, and revolving at a distance, say of 28 hundred millions.\r\nLeaving Neptune out of the account—of which as yet we know little\r\naccurately and which is, possibly, one of a system of Asteroids—it will\r\nbe seen that, within certain limits, there exists an _order of interval_\r\namong the planets. Speaking loosely, we may say that each outer planet\r\nis twice as far from the Sun as is the next inner one. May not the\r\n_order_ here mentioned—_may not the law of Bode—be deduced from\r\nconsideration of the analogy suggested by me as having place between the\r\nsolar discharge of rings and the mode of the atomic irradiation_?\r\n\r\nThe numbers hurriedly mentioned in this summary of distance, it is folly\r\nto attempt comprehending, unless in the light of abstract arithmetical\r\nfacts. They are not practically tangible ones. They convey no precise\r\nideas. I have stated that Neptune, the planet farthest from the Sun,\r\nrevolves about him at a distance of 28 hundred millions of miles. So far\r\ngood:—I have stated a mathematical fact; and, without comprehending it\r\nin the least, we may put it to use—mathematically. But in mentioning,\r\neven, that the Moon revolves about the Earth at the comparatively\r\ntrifling distance of 237,000 miles, I entertained no expectation of\r\ngiving any one to understand—to know—to feel—how far from the Earth the\r\nMoon actually _is_. 237,000 _miles_! There are, perhaps, few of my\r\nreaders who have not crossed the Atlantic ocean; yet how many of them\r\nhave a distinct idea of even the 3,000 miles intervening between shore\r\nand shore? I doubt, indeed, whether the man lives who can force into his\r\nbrain the most remote conception of the interval between one milestone\r\nand its next neighbor upon the turnpike. We are in some measure aided,\r\nhowever, in our consideration of distance, by combining this\r\nconsideration with the kindred one of velocity. Sound passes through\r\n1100 feet of space in a second of time. Now were it possible for an\r\ninhabitant of the Earth to see the flash of a cannon discharged in the\r\nMoon, and to hear the report, he would have to wait, after perceiving\r\nthe former, more than 13 entire days and nights before getting any\r\nintimation of the latter.\r\n\r\nHowever feeble be the impression, even thus conveyed, of the Moon’s real\r\ndistance from the Earth, it will, nevertheless, effect a good object in\r\nenabling us more clearly to see the futility of attempting to grasp such\r\nintervals as that of the 28 hundred millions of miles between our Sun\r\nand Neptune; or even that of the 95 millions between the Sun and the\r\nEarth we inhabit. A cannon-ball, flying at the greatest velocity with\r\nwhich such a ball has ever been known to fly, could not traverse the\r\nlatter interval in less than 20 years; while for the former it would\r\nrequire 590.\r\n\r\nOur Moon’s real diameter is 2160 miles; yet she is comparatively so\r\ntrifling an object that it would take nearly 50 such orbs to compose one\r\nas great as the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of our own globe is 7912 miles—but from the enunciation of\r\nthese numbers what positive idea do we derive?\r\n\r\nIf we ascend an ordinary mountain and look around us from its summit, we\r\nbehold a landscape stretching, say 40 miles, in every direction; forming\r\na circle 250 miles in circumference; and including an area of 5000\r\nsquare miles. The extent of such a prospect, on account of the\r\n_successiveness_ with which its portions necessarily present themselves\r\nto view, can be only very feebly and very partially appreciated:—yet the\r\nentire panorama would comprehend no more than one 40,000th part of the\r\nmere _surface_ of our globe. Were this panorama, then, to be succeeded,\r\nafter the lapse of an hour, by another of equal extent; this again by a\r\nthird, after the lapse of another hour; this again by a fourth after\r\nlapse of another hour—and so on, until the scenery of the whole Earth\r\nwere exhausted; and were we to be engaged in examining these various\r\npanoramas for twelve hours of every day; we should nevertheless, be 9\r\nyears and 48 days in completing the general survey.\r\n\r\nBut if the mere surface of the Earth eludes the grasp of the\r\nimagination, what are we to think of its cubical contents? It embraces a\r\nmass of matter equal in weight to at least 2 sextillions, 200\r\nquintillions of tons. Let us suppose it in a state of quiescence; and\r\nnow let us endeavor to conceive a mechanical force sufficient to set it\r\nin motion! Not the strength of all the myriads of beings whom we may\r\nconclude to inhabit the planetary worlds of our system—not the combined\r\nphysical strength of _all_ these beings—even admitting all to be more\r\npowerful than man—would avail to stir the ponderous mass _a single inch_\r\nfrom its position.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to understand, then, of the force, which under similar\r\ncircumstances, would be required to move the _largest_ of our planets,\r\nJupiter? This is 86,000 miles in diameter, and would include within its\r\nperiphery more than a thousand orbs of the magnitude of our own. Yet\r\nthis stupendous body is actually flying around the Sun at the rate of\r\n29,000 miles an hour—that is to say, with a velocity 40 times greater\r\nthan that of a cannon-ball! The thought of such a phænomenon cannot well\r\nbe said to _startle_ the mind:—it palsies and appals it. Not\r\nunfrequently we task our imagination in picturing the capacities of an\r\nangel. Let us fancy such a being at a distance of some hundred miles\r\nfrom Jupiter—a close eye-witness of this planet as it speeds on its\r\nannual revolution. Now _can_ we, I demand, fashion for ourselves any\r\nconception so distinct of this ideal being’s spiritual exaltation, as\r\n_that_ involved in the supposition that, even by this immeasurable mass\r\nof matter, whirled immediately before his eyes, with a velocity so\r\nunutterable, he—an angel—angelic though he be—is not at once struck into\r\nnothingness and overwhelmed?\r\n\r\nAt this point, however, it seems proper to suggest that, in fact, we\r\nhave been speaking of comparative trifles. Our Sun, the central and\r\ncontrolling orb of the system to which Jupiter belongs, is not only\r\ngreater than Jupiter, but greater by far than all the planets of the\r\nsystem taken together. This fact is an essential condition, indeed, of\r\nthe stability of the system itself. The diameter of Jupiter has been\r\nmentioned:—it is 86,000 miles:—that of the Sun is 882,000 miles. An\r\ninhabitant of the latter, travelling 90 miles a day, would be more than\r\n80 years in going round a great circle of its circumference. It occupies\r\na cubical space of 681 quadrillions, 472 trillions of miles. The Moon,\r\nas has been stated, revolves about the Earth at a distance of 237,000\r\nmiles—in an orbit, consequently, of nearly a million and a half. Now,\r\nwere the Sun placed upon the Earth, centre over centre, the body of the\r\nformer would extend, in every direction, not only to the line of the\r\nMoon’s orbit, but beyond it, a distance of 200,000 miles.\r\n\r\nAnd here, once again, let me suggest that, in fact, we have _still_ been\r\nspeaking of comparative trifles. The distance of the planet Neptune from\r\nthe Sun has been stated:—it is 28 hundred millions of miles; the\r\ncircumference of its orbit, therefore, is about 17 billions. Let this be\r\nborne in mind while we glance at some one of the brightest stars.\r\nBetween this and the star of _our_ system, (the Sun,) there is a gulf of\r\nspace, to convey any idea of which we should need the tongue of an\r\narchangel. From _our_ system, then, and from _our_ Sun, or star, the\r\nstar at which we suppose ourselves glancing is a thing altogether\r\napart:—still, for the moment, let us imagine it placed upon our Sun,\r\ncentre over centre, as we just now imagined this Sun itself placed upon\r\nthe Earth. Let us now conceive the particular star we have in mind,\r\nextending, in every direction, beyond the orbit of Mercury—of Venus—of\r\nthe Earth:—still _on_, beyond the orbit of Mars—of Jupiter—of\r\nUranus—until, finally, we fancy it filling the circle—17 _billions of\r\nmiles in circumference_—which is described by the revolution of\r\nLeverrier’s planet. When we have conceived all this, we shall have\r\nentertained no extravagant conception. There is the very best reason for\r\nbelieving that many of the stars are even far larger than the one we\r\nhave imagined. I mean to say that we have the very best _empirical_\r\nbasis for such belief:—and, in looking back at the original, atomic\r\narrangements for _diversity_, which have been assumed as a part of the\r\nDivine plan in the constitution of the Universe, we shall be enabled\r\neasily to understand, and to credit, the existence of even far vaster\r\ndisproportions in stellar size than any to which I have hitherto\r\nalluded. The largest orbs, of course, we must expect to find rolling\r\nthrough the widest vacancies of Space.\r\n\r\nI remarked, just now, that to convey an idea of the interval between our\r\nSun and any one of the other stars, we should require the eloquence of\r\nan archangel. In so saying, I should not be accused of exaggeration;\r\nfor, in simple truth, these are topics on which it is scarcely possible\r\nto exaggerate. But let us bring the matter more distinctly before the\r\neye of the mind.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we may get a general, _relative_ conception of the\r\ninterval referred to, by comparing it with the inter-planetary spaces.\r\nIf, for example, we suppose the Earth, which is, in reality, 95 millions\r\nof miles from the Sun, to be only _one foot_ from that luminary; then\r\nNeptune would be 40 feet distant; _and the star Alpha Lyræ, at the very\r\nleast_, 159.\r\n\r\nNow I presume that, in the termination of my last sentence, few of my\r\nreaders have noticed anything especially objectionable—particularly\r\nwrong. I said that the distance of the Earth from the Sun being taken at\r\n_one foot_, the distance of Neptune would be 40 feet, and that of Alpha\r\nLyræ, 159. The proportion between one foot and 159 has appeared,\r\nperhaps, to convey a sufficiently definite impression of the proportion\r\nbetween the two intervals—that of the Earth from the Sun and that of\r\nAlpha Lyræ from the same luminary. But my account of the matter should,\r\nin reality, have run thus:—The distance of the Earth from the Sun being\r\ntaken at one foot, the distance of Neptune would be 40 feet, and that of\r\nAlpha Lyræ, 159——_miles_:—that is to say, I had assigned to Alpha Lyræ,\r\nin my first statement of the case, only the 5280_th_ _part_ of that\r\ndistance which is the _least distance possible_ at which it can actually\r\nlie.\r\n\r\nTo proceed:—However distant a mere _planet_ is, yet when we look at it\r\nthrough a telescope, we see it under a certain form—of a certain\r\nappreciable size. Now I have already hinted at the probable bulk of many\r\nof the stars; nevertheless, when we view any one of them, even through\r\nthe most powerful telescope, it is found to present us with _no form_,\r\nand consequently with _no magnitude_ whatever. We see it as a point and\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\nAgain;—Let us suppose ourselves walking, at night, on a highway. In a\r\nfield on one side of the road, is a line of tall objects, say trees, the\r\nfigures of which are distinctly defined against the background of the\r\nsky. This line of objects extends at right angles to the road, and from\r\nthe road to the horizon. Now, as we proceed along the road, we see these\r\nobjects changing their positions, respectively, in relation to a certain\r\nfixed point in that portion of the firmament which forms the background\r\nof the view. Let us suppose this fixed point—sufficiently fixed for our\r\npurpose—to be the rising moon. We become aware, at once, that while the\r\ntree nearest us so far alters its position in respect to the moon, as to\r\nseem flying behind us, the tree in the extreme distance has scarcely\r\nchanged at all its relative position with the satellite. We then go on\r\nto perceive that the farther the objects are from us, the less they\r\nalter their positions; and the converse. Then we begin, unwittingly, to\r\nestimate the distances of individual trees by the degrees in which they\r\nevince the relative alteration. Finally, we come to understand how it\r\nmight be possible to ascertain the actual distance of any given tree in\r\nthe line, by using the amount of relative alteration as a basis in a\r\nsimple geometrical problem. Now this relative alteration is what we call\r\n“parallax;” and by parallax we calculate the distances of the heavenly\r\nbodies. Applying the principle to the trees in question, we should, of\r\ncourse, be very much at a loss to comprehend the distance of _that_\r\ntree, which, however far we proceeded along the road, should evince _no_\r\nparallax at all. This, in the case described, is a thing impossible; but\r\nimpossible only because all distances on our Earth are trivial\r\nindeed:—in comparison with the vast cosmical quantities, we may speak of\r\nthem as absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nNow, let us suppose the star Alpha Lyræ directly overhead; and let us\r\nimagine that, instead of standing on the Earth, we stand at one end of a\r\nstraight road stretching through Space to a distance equalling the\r\ndiameter of the Earth’s orbit—that is to say, to a distance of 190\r\n_millions of miles_. Having observed, by means of the most delicate\r\nmicrometrical instruments, the exact position of the star, let us now\r\npass along this inconceivable road, until we reach its other extremity.\r\nNow, once again, let us look at the star. It is _precisely_ where we\r\nleft it. Our instruments, however delicate, assure us that its relative\r\nposition is absolutely—is identically the same as at the commencement of\r\nour unutterable journey. _No_ parallax—none whatever—has been found.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that, in regard to the distance of the fixed stars—of any\r\none of the myriads of suns glistening on the farther side of that awful\r\nchasm which separates our system from its brothers in the cluster to\r\nwhich it belongs—astronomical science, until very lately, could speak\r\nonly with a negative certainty. Assuming the brightest as the nearest,\r\nwe could say, even of _them_, only that there is a certain\r\nincomprehensible distance on the _hither_ side of which they cannot\r\nbe:—how far they are beyond it we had in no case been able to ascertain.\r\nWe perceived, for example, that Alpha Lyræ cannot be nearer to us than\r\n19 trillions, 200 billions of miles; but, for all we knew, and indeed\r\nfor all we now know, it may be distant from us the square, or the cube,\r\nor any other power of the number mentioned. By dint, however, of\r\nwonderfully minute and cautious observations, continued, with novel\r\ninstruments, for many laborious years, _Bessel_, not long ago deceased,\r\nhas lately succeeded in determining the distance of six or seven stars;\r\namong others, that of the star numbered 61 in the constellation of the\r\nSwan. The distance in this latter instance ascertained, is 670,000 times\r\nthat of the Sun; which last it will be remembered, is 95 millions of\r\nmiles. The star 61 Cygni, then, is nearly 64 trillions of miles from\r\nus—or more than three times the distance assigned, _as the least\r\npossible_, for Alpha Lyræ.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to appreciate this interval by the aid of any\r\nconsiderations of _velocity_, as we did in endeavoring to estimate the\r\ndistance of the moon, we must leave out of sight, altogether, such\r\nnothings as the speed of a cannon-ball, or of sound. Light, however,\r\naccording to the latest calculations of Struve, proceeds at the rate of\r\n167,000 miles in a second. Thought itself cannot pass through this\r\ninterval more speedily—if, indeed, thought can traverse it at all. Yet,\r\nin coming from 61 Cygni to us, even at this inconceivable rate, light\r\noccupies more than _ten years_; and, consequently, were the star this\r\nmoment blotted out from the Universe, still, _for ten years_, would it\r\ncontinue to sparkle on, undimmed in its paradoxical glory.\r\n\r\nKeeping now in mind whatever feeble conception we may have attained of\r\nthe interval between our Sun and 61 Cygni, let us remember that this\r\ninterval, however unutterably vast, we are permitted to consider as but\r\nthe _average_ interval among the countless host of stars composing that\r\ncluster, or “nebula,” to which our system, as well as that of 61 Cygni,\r\nbelongs. I have, in fact, stated the case with great moderation:—we have\r\nexcellent reason for believing 61 Cygni to be one of the _nearest_\r\nstars, and thus for concluding, at least for the present, that its\r\ndistance from us is _less_ than the average distance between star and\r\nstar in the magnificent cluster of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nAnd here, once again and finally, it seems proper to suggest that even\r\nas yet we have been speaking of trifles. Ceasing to wonder at the space\r\nbetween star and star in our own or in any particular cluster, let us\r\nrather turn our thoughts to the intervals between cluster and cluster,\r\nin the all comprehensive cluster of the Universe.\r\n\r\nI have already said that light proceeds at the rate of 167,000 miles in\r\na second—that is, about 10 millions of miles in a minute, or about 600\r\nmillions of miles in an hour:—yet so far removed from us are some of\r\nthe “nebulæ” that even light, speeding with this velocity, could not\r\nand does not reach us, from those mysterious regions, in less than 3\r\n_millions of years_. This calculation, moreover, is made by the elder\r\nHerschell, and in reference merely to those comparatively proximate\r\nclusters within the scope of his own telescope. There _are_ “nebulæ,”\r\nhowever, which, through the magical tube of Lord Rosse, are this instant\r\nwhispering in our ears the secrets of _a million of ages_ by-gone. In a\r\nword, the events which we behold now—at this moment—in those worlds—are\r\nthe identical events which interested their inhabitants _ten hundred\r\nthousand centuries ago_. In intervals—in distances such as this\r\nsuggestion forces upon the _soul_—rather than upon the mind—we find, at\r\nlength, a fitting climax to all hitherto frivolous considerations of\r\n_quantity_.\r\n\r\nOur fancies thus occupied with the cosmical distances, let us take the\r\nopportunity of referring to the difficulty which we have so often\r\nexperienced, while pursuing _the beaten path_ of astronomical\r\nreflection, _in accounting_ for the immeasurable voids alluded to—in\r\ncomprehending why chasms so totally unoccupied and therefore apparently\r\nso needless, have been made to intervene between star and star—between\r\ncluster and cluster—in understanding, to be brief, a sufficient reason\r\nfor the Titanic scale, in respect of mere _Space_, on which the Universe\r\nis seen to be constructed. A rational cause for the phænomenon, I\r\nmaintain that Astronomy has palpably failed to assign:—but the\r\nconsiderations through which, in this Essay, we have proceeded step by\r\nstep, enable us clearly and immediately to perceive that _Space and\r\nDuration are one_. That the Universe might _endure_ throughout an æra\r\nat all commensurate with the grandeur of its component material portions\r\nand with the high majesty of its spiritual purposes, it was necessary\r\nthat the original atomic diffusion be made to so inconceivable an extent\r\nas to be only not infinite. It was required, in a word, that the stars\r\nshould be gathered into visibility from invisible nebulosity—proceed\r\nfrom nebulosity to consolidation—and so grow grey in giving birth and\r\ndeath to unspeakably numerous and complex variations of vitalic\r\ndevelopment:—it was required that the stars should do all this—should\r\nhave time thoroughly to accomplish all these Divine purposes—_during the\r\nperiod_ in which all things were effecting their return into Unity with\r\na velocity accumulating in the inverse proportion of the squares of the\r\ndistances at which lay the inevitable End.\r\n\r\nThroughout all this we have no difficulty in understanding the absolute\r\naccuracy of the Divine _adaptation_. The density of the stars,\r\nrespectively, proceeds, of course, as their condensation diminishes;\r\ncondensation and heterogeneity keep pace with each other; through the\r\nlatter, which is the index of the former, we estimate the vitalic and\r\nspiritual development. Thus, in the density of the globes, we have the\r\nmeasure in which their purposes are fulfilled. _As_ density\r\nproceeds—_as_ the divine intentions _are_ accomplished—_as_ less and\r\nstill less remains _to be_ accomplished—so—in the same ratio—should we\r\nexpect to find an acceleration of _the End_:—and thus the philosophical\r\nmind will easily comprehend that the Divine designs in constituting the\r\nstars, advance _mathematically_ to their fulfilment:—and more; it will\r\nreadily give the advance a mathematical expression; it will decide that\r\nthis advance is inversely proportional with the squares of the distances\r\nof all created things from the starting-point and goal of their\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nNot only is this Divine adaptation, however, mathematically accurate,\r\nbut there is that about it which stamps it _as divine_, in distinction\r\nfrom that which is merely the work of human constructiveness. I allude\r\nto the complete _mutuality_ of adaptation. For example; in human\r\nconstructions a particular cause has a particular effect; a particular\r\nintention brings to pass a particular object; but this is all; we see no\r\nreciprocity. The effect does not re-act upon the cause; the intention\r\ndoes not change relations with the object. In Divine constructions the\r\nobject is either design or object as we choose to regard it—and we may\r\ntake at any time a cause for an effect, or the converse—so that we can\r\nnever absolutely decide which is which.\r\n\r\nTo give an instance:—In polar climates the human frame, to maintain its\r\nanimal heat, requires, for combustion in the capillary system, an\r\nabundant supply of highly azotized food, such as train-oil. But\r\nagain:—in polar climates nearly the sole food afforded man is the oil of\r\nabundant seals and whales. Now, whether is oil at hand because\r\nimperatively demanded, or the only thing demanded because the only thing\r\nto be obtained? It is impossible to decide. There is an absolute\r\n_reciprocity of adaptation_.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure which we derive from any display of human ingenuity is in\r\nthe ratio of _the approach_ to this species of reciprocity. In the\r\nconstruction of _plot_, for example, in fictitious literature, we\r\nshould aim at so arranging the incidents that we shall not be able to\r\ndetermine, of any one of them, whether it depends from any one other or\r\nupholds it. In this sense, of course, _perfection_ of _plot_ is really,\r\nor practically, unattainable—but only because it is a finite\r\nintelligence that constructs. The plots of God are perfect. The Universe\r\nis a plot of God.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have reached a point at which the intellect is forced, again,\r\nto struggle against its propensity for analogical inference—against its\r\nmonomaniac grasping at the infinite. Moons have been seen _revolving_\r\nabout planets; planets about stars; and the poetical instinct of\r\nhumanity—its instinct of the symmetrical, if the symmetry be but a\r\nsymmetry of surface:—this _instinct_, which the Soul, not only of Man\r\nbut of all created beings, took up, in the beginning, from the\r\n_geometrical_ basis of the Universal irradiation—impels us to the fancy\r\nof an endless extension of this system of _cycles_. Closing our eyes\r\nequally to _de_duction and _in_duction, we insist upon imagining a\r\n_revolution_ of all the orbs of the Galaxy about some gigantic globe\r\nwhich we take to be the central pivot of the whole. Each cluster in the\r\ngreat cluster of clusters is imagined, of course, to be similarly\r\nsupplied and constructed; while, that the “analogy” may be wanting at no\r\npoint, we go on to conceive these clusters themselves, again, as\r\n_revolving_ about some still more august sphere;—this latter, still\r\nagain, _with_ its encircling clusters, as but one of a yet more\r\nmagnificent series of agglomerations, _gyrating_ about yet another orb\r\ncentral _to them_—some orb still more unspeakably sublime—some orb, let\r\nus rather say, of infinite sublimity endlessly multiplied by the\r\ninfinitely sublime. Such are the conditions, continued in perpetuity,\r\nwhich the voice of what some people term “analogy” calls upon the Fancy\r\nto depict and the Reason to contemplate, if possible, without becoming\r\ndissatisfied with the picture. Such, _in general_, are the interminable\r\ngyrations beyond gyration which we have been instructed by Philosophy to\r\ncomprehend and to account for, at least in the best manner we can. Now\r\nand then, however, a philosopher proper—one whose phrenzy takes a very\r\ndeterminate turn—whose genius, to speak more reverentially, has a\r\nstrongly-pronounced washerwomanish bias, doing every thing up by the\r\ndozen—enables us to see _precisely_ that point out of sight, at which\r\nthe revolutionary processes in question do, and of right ought to, come\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly worth while, perhaps, even to sneer at the reveries of\r\nFourrier:—but much has been said, latterly, of the hypothesis of\r\nMädler—that there exists, in the centre of the Galaxy, a stupendous\r\nglobe about which all the systems of the cluster revolve. The _period_\r\nof our own, indeed, has been stated—117 millions of years.\r\n\r\nThat our Sun has a motion in space, independently of its rotation, and\r\nrevolution about the system’s centre of gravity, has long been\r\nsuspected. This motion, granting it to exist, would be manifested\r\nperspectively. The stars in that firmamental region which we were\r\nleaving behind us, would, in a very long series of years, become\r\ncrowded; those in the opposite quarter, scattered. Now, by means of\r\nastronomical History, we ascertain, cloudily, that some such phænomena\r\nhave occurred. On this ground it has been declared that our system is\r\nmoving to a point in the heavens diametrically opposite the star Zeta\r\nHerculis:—but this inference is, perhaps, the maximum to which we have\r\nany logical right. Mädler, however, has gone so far as to designate a\r\nparticular star, Alcyone in the Pleiades, as being at or about the very\r\nspot around which a general _revolution_ is performed.\r\n\r\nNow, since by “analogy” we are led, in the first instance, to these\r\ndreams, it is no more than proper that we should abide by analogy, at\r\nleast in some measure, during their development; and that analogy which\r\nsuggests the revolution, suggests at the same time a central orb about\r\nwhich it should be performed:—so far the astronomer was consistent. This\r\ncentral orb, however, should, dynamically, be greater than all the orbs,\r\ntaken together, which surround it. Of these there are about 100\r\nmillions. “Why, then,” it was of course demanded, “do we not _see_ this\r\nvast central sun—_at least equal_ in mass to 100 millions of such suns\r\nas ours—why do we not _see_ it—_we_, especially, who occupy the mid\r\nregion of the cluster—the very locality _near_ which, at all events,\r\nmust be situated this incomparable star?” The reply was ready—“It must\r\nbe non-luminous, as are our planets.” Here, then, to suit a purpose,\r\nanalogy is suddenly let fall. “Not so,” it may be said—“we know that\r\nnon-luminous suns actually exist.” It is true that we have reason at\r\nleast for supposing so; but we have certainly no reason whatever for\r\nsupposing that the non-luminous suns in question are encircled by\r\n_luminous_ suns, while these again are surrounded by non-luminous\r\nplanets:—and it is precisely all this with which Mädler is called upon\r\nto find any thing analogous in the heavens—for it is precisely all this\r\nwhich he imagines in the case of the Galaxy. Admitting the thing to be\r\nso, we cannot help here picturing to ourselves how sad a puzzle the _why\r\nit is so_ must prove to all _à priori_ philosophers.\r\n\r\nBut granting, in the very teeth of analogy and of every thing else, the\r\nnon-luminosity of the vast central orb, we may still inquire how this\r\norb, so enormous, could fail of being rendered visible by the flood of\r\nlight thrown upon it from the 100 millions of glorious suns glaring in\r\nall directions about it. Upon the urging of this question, the idea of\r\nan actually solid central sun appears, in some measure, to have been\r\nabandoned; and speculation proceeded to assert that the systems of the\r\ncluster perform their revolutions merely about an immaterial centre of\r\ngravity common to all. Here again then, to suit a purpose, analogy is\r\nlet fall. The planets of our system revolve, it is true, about a common\r\ncentre of gravity; but they do this in connexion with, and in\r\nconsequence of, a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the\r\nrest of the system.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight\r\nlines. But this idea of the circle—an idea which, in view of all\r\nordinary geometry, is merely the mathematical, as contradistinguished\r\nfrom the practical, idea—is, in sober fact, the _practical_ conception\r\nwhich alone we have any right to entertain in regard to the majestic\r\ncircle with which we have to deal, at least in fancy, when we suppose\r\nour system revolving about a point in the centre of the Galaxy. Let the\r\nmost vigorous of human imaginations attempt but to take a single step\r\ntowards the comprehension of a sweep so ineffable! It would scarcely be\r\nparadoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself, travelling\r\n_forever_ upon the circumference of this unutterable circle, would\r\nstill, _forever_, be travelling in a straight line. That the path of our\r\nSun in such an orbit would, to any human perception, deviate in the\r\nslightest degree from a straight line, even in a million of years, is a\r\nproposition not to be entertained:—yet we are required to believe that a\r\ncurvature has become apparent during the brief period of our\r\nastronomical history—during a mere point—during the utter nothingness of\r\ntwo or three thousand years.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that Mädler _has_ really ascertained a curvature in the\r\ndirection of our system’s now well-established progress through Space.\r\nAdmitting, if necessary, this fact to be in reality such, I maintain\r\nthat nothing is thereby shown except the reality of this fact—the fact\r\nof a curvature. For its _thorough_ determination, ages will be required;\r\nand, when determined, it will be found indicative of some binary or\r\nother multiple relation between our Sun and some one or more of the\r\nproximate stars. I hazard nothing however, in predicting, that, after\r\nthe lapse of many centuries, all efforts at determining the path of our\r\nSun through Space, will be abandoned as fruitless. This is easily\r\nconceivable when we look at the infinity of perturbation it must\r\nexperience, from its perpetually-shifting relations with other orbs, in\r\nthe common approach of all to the nucleus of the Galaxy.\r\n\r\nBut in examining other “nebulæ” than that of the Milky Way—in surveying,\r\ngenerally, the clusters which overspread the heavens—do we or do we not\r\nfind confirmation of Mädler’s hypothesis? We do _not_. The forms of the\r\nclusters are exceedingly diverse when casually viewed; but on close\r\ninspection, through powerful telescopes, we recognize the sphere, very\r\ndistinctly, as at least the proximate form of all:—their constitution,\r\nin general, being at variance with the idea of revolution about a common\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n“It is difficult,” says Sir John Herschell, “to form any conception of\r\nthe dynamical state of such systems. On one hand, without a rotary\r\nmotion and a centrifugal force, it is hardly possible not to regard them\r\nas in a state of _progressive collapse_. On the other, granting such a\r\nmotion and such a force, we find it no less difficult to reconcile their\r\nforms with the rotation of the whole system [meaning cluster] around any\r\nsingle axis, without which internal collision would appear to be\r\ninevitable.”\r\n\r\nSome remarks lately made about the “nebulæ” by Dr. Nichol, in taking\r\nquite a different view of the cosmical conditions from any taken in this\r\nDiscourse—have a very peculiar applicability to the point now at issue.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n“When our greatest telescopes are brought to bear upon them, we find\r\nthat those which were thought to be irregular, are not so; they approach\r\nnearer to a globe. Here is one that looked oval; but Lord Rosse’s\r\ntelescope brought it into a circle.... Now there occurs a very\r\nremarkable circumstance in reference to these comparatively sweeping\r\ncircular masses of nebulæ. We find they are not entirely circular, but\r\nthe reverse; and that all around them, on every side, there are volumes\r\nof stars, _stretching out apparently as if they were rushing towards a\r\ngreat central mass in consequence of the action of some great\r\npower_.”[12]\r\n\r\n    [12] I must be understood as denying, _especially_, only the\r\n    _revolutionary_ portion of Mädler’s hypothesis. Of course, if\r\n    no great central orb exists _now_ in our cluster, such will\r\n    exist hereafter. Whenever existing, it will be merely the\r\n    _nucleus_ of the consolidation.\r\n\r\nWere I to describe, in my own words, what must necessarily be the\r\nexisting condition of each nebula on the hypothesis that all matter is,\r\nas I suggest, now returning to its original Unity, I should simply be\r\ngoing over, nearly verbatim, the language here employed by Dr. Nichol,\r\nwithout the faintest suspicion of that stupendous truth which is the key\r\nto these nebular phænomena.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me fortify my position still farther, by the voice of a\r\ngreater than Mädler—of one, moreover, to whom all the data of Mädler\r\nhave long been familiar things, carefully and thoroughly considered.\r\nReferring to the elaborate calculations of Argelander—the very\r\nresearches which form Mädler’s basis—_Humboldt_, whose generalizing\r\npowers have never, perhaps been equalled, has the following observation:\r\n\r\n“When we regard the real, proper, or non-perspective motions of the\r\nstars, we find _many groups of them moving in opposite directions_; and\r\nthe data as yet in hand render it not necessary, at least, to conceive\r\nthat the systems composing the Milky Way, or the clusters, generally,\r\ncomposing the Universe, are revolving about any particular centre\r\nunknown, whether luminous or non-luminous. It is but Man’s longing for a\r\nfundamental First Cause, that impels both his intellect and his fancy\r\nto the adoption of such an hypothesis.”[13]\r\n\r\n    [13] Betrachtet man die nicht perspectivischen eigenen\r\n    Bewegungen der Sterne, so scheinen viele gruppenweise in ihrer\r\n    Richtung entgegengesetzt; und die bisher gesammelten Thatsachen\r\n    machen es auf’s wenigste nicht nothwendig, anzunehmen, dass\r\n    alle Theile unserer Sternenschicht oder gar der gesammten\r\n    Sterneninseln, welche den Weltraum füllen, sich um einen\r\n    grossen, unbekannten, leuchtenden oder dunkeln Centralkörper\r\n    bewegen. Das Streben nach den letzten und höchsten\r\n    Grundursachen macht freilich die reflectirende Thätigkeit des\r\n    Menschen, wie seine Phantasie, zu einer solchen Annahme\r\n    geneigt.\r\n\r\nThe phænomenon here alluded to—that of “many groups moving in opposite\r\ndirections”—is quite inexplicable by Mädler’s idea; but arises, as a\r\nnecessary consequence, from that which forms the basis of this\r\nDiscourse. While the _merely general direction_ of each atom—of each\r\nmoon, planet, star, or cluster—would, on my hypothesis, be, of course,\r\nabsolutely rectilinear; while the _general_ path of all bodies would be\r\na right line leading to the centre of all; it is clear, nevertheless,\r\nthat this general rectilinearity would be compounded of what, with\r\nscarcely any exaggeration, we may term an infinity of particular\r\ncurves—an infinity of local deviations from rectilinearity—the result of\r\ncontinuous differences of relative position among the multitudinous\r\nmasses, as each proceeded on its own proper journey to the End.\r\n\r\nI quoted, just now, from Sir John Herschell, the following words, used\r\nin reference to the clusters:—“On one hand, without a rotary motion and\r\na centrifugal force, it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a\r\nstate of _progressive collapse_.” The fact is, that, in surveying the\r\n“nebulæ” with a telescope of high power, we shall find it quite\r\nimpossible, having once conceived this idea of “collapse,” not to\r\ngather, at all points, corroboration of the idea. A nucleus is always\r\napparent, in the direction of which the stars seem to be precipitating\r\nthemselves; nor can these nuclei be mistaken for merely perspective\r\nphænomena:—the clusters are _really_ denser near the centre—sparser in\r\nthe regions more remote from it. In a word, we see every thing as we\r\n_should_ see it were a collapse taking place; but, in general, it may be\r\nsaid of these clusters, that we can fairly entertain, while looking at\r\nthem, the idea of _orbitual movement about a centre_, only by admitting\r\nthe _possible_ existence, in the distant domains of space, of dynamical\r\nlaws with which _we_ are unacquainted.\r\n\r\nOn the part of Herschell, however, there is evidently _a reluctance_ to\r\nregard the nebulæ as in “a state of progressive collapse.” But if\r\nfacts—if even appearances justify the supposition of their being in this\r\nstate, _why_, it may well be demanded, is he disinclined to admit it?\r\nSimply on account of a prejudice;—merely because the supposition is at\r\nwar with a preconceived and utterly baseless notion—that of the\r\nendlessness—that of the eternal stability of the Universe.\r\n\r\nIf the propositions of this Discourse are tenable, the “state of\r\nprogressive collapse” is _precisely_ that state in which alone we are\r\nwarranted in considering All Things; and, with due humility, let me here\r\nconfess that, for my part, I am at a loss to conceive how any _other_\r\nunderstanding of the existing condition of affairs, could ever have made\r\nits way into the human brain. “The tendency to collapse” and “the\r\nattraction of gravitation” are convertible phrases. In using either, we\r\nspeak of the rëaction of the First Act. Never was necessity less obvious\r\nthan that of supposing Matter imbued with an ineradicable _quality_\r\nforming part of its material nature—a quality, or instinct, _forever_\r\ninseparable from it, and by dint of which inalienable principle every\r\natom is _perpetually_ impelled to seek its fellow-atom. Never was\r\nnecessity less obvious than that of entertaining this unphilosophical\r\nidea. Going boldly behind the vulgar thought, we have to conceive,\r\nmetaphysically, that the gravitating principle appertains to Matter\r\n_temporarily_—only while diffused—only while existing as Many instead of\r\nas One—appertains to it by virtue of its state of irradiation\r\nalone—appertains, in a word, altogether to its _condition_, and not in\r\nthe slightest degree to _itself_. In this view, when the irradiation\r\nshall have returned into its source—when the rëaction shall be\r\ncompleted—the gravitating principle will no longer exist. And, in fact,\r\nastronomers, without at any time reaching the idea here suggested, seem\r\nto have been approximating it, in the assertion that “if there were but\r\none body in the Universe, it would be impossible to understand how the\r\nprinciple, Gravity, could obtain:”—that is to say, from a consideration\r\nof Matter as they find it, they reach a conclusion at which I\r\ndeductively arrive. That so pregnant a suggestion as the one just quoted\r\nshould have been permitted to remain so long unfruitful, is,\r\nnevertheless, a mystery which I find it difficult to fathom.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, in no little degree, however, our propensity for the\r\ncontinuous—for the analogical—in the present case more particularly for\r\nthe symmetrical—which has been leading us astray. And, in fact, the\r\nsense of the symmetrical is an instinct which may be depended upon with\r\nan almost blindfold reliance. It is the poetical essence of the\r\nUniverse—_of the Universe_ which, in the supremeness of its symmetry, is\r\nbut the most sublime of poems. Now symmetry and consistency are\r\nconvertible terms:—thus Poetry and Truth are one. A thing is consistent\r\nin the ratio of its truth—true in the ratio of its consistency. _A\r\nperfect consistency, I repeat, can be nothing but an absolute truth._ We\r\nmay take it for granted, then, that Man cannot long or widely err, if he\r\nsuffer himself to be guided by his poetical, which I have maintained to\r\nbe his truthful, in being his symmetrical, instinct. He must have a\r\ncare, however, lest, in pursuing too heedlessly the superficial symmetry\r\nof forms and motions, he leave out of sight the really essential\r\nsymmetry of the principles which determine and control them.\r\n\r\nThat the stellar bodies would finally be merged in one—that, at last,\r\nall would be drawn into the substance of _one stupendous central orb\r\nalready existing_—is an idea which, for some time past, seems, vaguely\r\nand indeterminately, to have held possession of the fancy of mankind. It\r\nis an idea, in fact, which belongs to the class of the _excessively\r\nobvious_. It springs, instantly, from a superficial observation of the\r\ncyclic and seemingly _gyrating_, or _vorticial_ movements of those\r\nindividual portions of the Universe which come most immediately and most\r\nclosely under our observation. There is not, perhaps, a human being, of\r\nordinary education and of average reflective capacity, to whom, at some\r\nperiod, the fancy in question has not occurred, as if spontaneously, or\r\nintuitively, and wearing all the character of a very profound and very\r\noriginal conception. This conception, however, so commonly entertained,\r\nhas never, within my knowledge, arisen out of any abstract\r\nconsiderations. Being, on the contrary, always suggested, as I say, by\r\nthe vorticial movements about centres, a reason for it, also,—a _cause_\r\nfor the ingathering of all the orbs into one, _imagined to be already\r\nexisting_, was naturally sought in the same direction—among these cyclic\r\nmovements themselves.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that, on announcement of the gradual and perfectly\r\nregular decrease observed in the orbit of Enck’s comet, at every\r\nsuccessive revolution about our Sun, astronomers were nearly unanimous\r\nin the opinion that the cause in question was found—that a principle was\r\ndiscovered sufficient to account, physically, for that final, universal\r\nagglomeration which, I repeat, the analogical, symmetrical or poetical\r\ninstinct of Man had predetermined to understand as something more than a\r\nsimple hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThis cause—this sufficient reason for the final ingathering—was declared\r\nto exist in an exceedingly rare but still material medium pervading\r\nspace; which medium, by retarding, in some degree, the progress of the\r\ncomet, perpetually weakened its tangential force; thus giving a\r\npredominance to the centripetal; which, of course, drew the comet nearer\r\nand nearer at each revolution, and would eventually precipitate it upon\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\nAll this was strictly logical—admitting the medium or ether; but this\r\nether was assumed, most illogically, on the ground that no _other_ mode\r\nthan the one spoken of could be discovered, of accounting for the\r\nobserved decrease in the orbit of the comet:—as if from the fact that we\r\ncould _discover_ no other mode of accounting for it, it followed, in any\r\nrespect, that no other mode of accounting for it existed. It is clear\r\nthat innumerable causes might operate, in combination, to diminish the\r\norbit, without even a possibility of our ever becoming acquainted with\r\none of them. In the meantime, it has never been fairly shown, perhaps,\r\nwhy the retardation occasioned by the skirts of the Sun’s atmosphere,\r\nthrough which the comet passes at perihelion, is not enough to account\r\nfor the phænomenon. That Enck’s comet will be absorbed into the Sun, is\r\nprobable; that all the comets of the system will be absorbed, is more\r\nthan merely possible; but, in such case, the principle of absorption\r\nmust be referred to eccentricity of orbit—to the close approximation to\r\nthe Sun, of the comets at their perihelia; and is a principle not\r\naffecting, in any degree, the ponderous _spheres_, which are to be\r\nregarded as the true material constituents of the Universe.—Touching\r\ncomets, in general, let me here suggest, in passing, that we cannot be\r\nfar wrong in looking upon them as the _lightning-flashes of the cosmical\r\nHeaven_.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a retarding ether and, through it, of a final agglomeration\r\nof all things, seemed at one time, however, to be confirmed by the\r\nobservation of a positive decrease in the orbit of the solid moon. By\r\nreference to eclipses recorded 2500 years ago, it was found that the\r\nvelocity of the satellite’s revolution _then_ was considerably less than\r\nit is _now_; that on the hypothesis that its motions in its orbit is\r\nuniformly in accordance with Kepler’s law, and was accurately determined\r\n_then_—2500 years ago—it is now in advance of the position it _should_\r\noccupy, by nearly 9000 miles. The increase of velocity proved, of\r\ncourse, a diminution of orbit; and astronomers were fast yielding to a\r\nbelief in an ether, as the sole mode of accounting for the phænomenon,\r\nwhen Lagrange came to the rescue. He showed that, owing to the\r\nconfigurations of the spheroids, the shorter axes of their ellipses are\r\nsubject to variation in length; the longer axes being permanent; and\r\nthat this variation is continuous and vibratory—so that every orbit is\r\nin a state of transition, either from circle to ellipse, or from ellipse\r\nto circle. In the case of the moon, where the shorter axis is\r\n_de_creasing, the orbit is passing from circle to ellipse and,\r\nconsequently, is _de_creasing too; but, after a long series of ages, the\r\nultimate eccentricity will be attained; then the shorter axis will\r\nproceed to _in_crease, until the orbit becomes a circle; when the\r\nprocess of shortening will again take place;—and so on forever. In the\r\ncase of the Earth, the orbit is passing from ellipse to circle. The\r\nfacts thus demonstrated do away, of course, with all necessity for\r\nsupposing an ether, and with all apprehension of the system’s\r\ninstability—on the ether’s account.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that I have myself assumed what we may term _an\r\nether_. I have spoken of a subtle _influence_ which we know to be ever\r\nin attendance upon matter, although becoming manifest only through\r\nmatter’s heterogeneity. To this _influence_—without daring to touch it\r\nat all in any effort at explaining its awful _nature_—I have referred\r\nthe various phænomena of electricity, heat, light, magnetism; and\r\nmore—of vitality, consciousness, and thought—in a word, of spirituality.\r\nIt will be seen, at once, then, that the ether thus conceived is\r\nradically distinct from the ether of the astronomers; inasmuch as theirs\r\nis _matter_ and mine _not_.\r\n\r\nWith the idea of a material ether, seems, thus, to have departed\r\naltogether the thought of that universal agglomeration so long\r\npredetermined by the poetical fancy of mankind:—an agglomeration in\r\nwhich a sound Philosophy might have been warranted in putting faith, at\r\nleast to a certain extent, if for no other reason than that by this\r\npoetical fancy it _had_ been so predetermined. But so far as\r\nAstronomy—so far as mere Physics have yet spoken, the cycles of the\r\nUniverse are perpetual—the Universe has no conceivable end. Had an end\r\nbeen demonstrated, however, from so purely collateral a cause as an\r\nether, Man’s instinct of the Divine _capacity to adapt_, would have\r\nrebelled against the demonstration. We should have been forced to regard\r\nthe Universe with some such sense of dissatisfaction as we experience in\r\ncontemplating an unnecessarily complex work of human art. Creation would\r\nhave affected us as an imperfect _plot_ in a romance, where the\r\n_dénoûment_ is awkwardly brought about by interposed incidents external\r\nand foreign to the main subject; instead of springing out of the bosom\r\nof the thesis—out of the heart of the ruling idea—instead of arising as\r\na result of the primary proposition—as inseparable and inevitable part\r\nand parcel of the fundamental conception of the book.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by the symmetry of mere surface will now be more clearly\r\nunderstood. It is simply by the blandishment of this symmetry that we\r\nhave been beguiled into the general idea of which Mädler’s hypothesis is\r\nbut a part—the idea of the vorticial indrawing of the orbs. Dismissing\r\nthis nakedly physical conception, the symmetry of principle sees the end\r\nof all things metaphysically involved in the thought of a beginning;\r\nseeks and finds in this origin of all things the _rudiment_ of this end;\r\nand perceives the impiety of supposing this end likely to be brought\r\nabout less simply—less directly—less obviously—less artistically—than\r\nthrough _the rëaction of the originating Act_.\r\n\r\nRecurring, then, to a previous suggestion, let us understand the\r\nsystems—let us understand each star, with its attendant planets—as but a\r\nTitanic atom existing in space with precisely the same inclination for\r\nUnity which characterized, in the beginning, the actual atoms after\r\ntheir irradiation throughout the Universal sphere. As these original\r\natoms rushed towards each other in generally straight lines, so let us\r\nconceive as at least generally rectilinear, the paths of the\r\nsystem-atoms towards their respective centres of aggregation:—and in\r\nthis direct drawing together of the systems into clusters, with a\r\nsimilar and simultaneous drawing together of the clusters themselves\r\nwhile undergoing consolidation, we have at length attained the great\r\n_Now_—the awful Present—the Existing Condition of the Universe.\r\n\r\nOf the still more awful Future a not irrational analogy may guide us in\r\nframing an hypothesis. The equilibrium between the centripetal and\r\ncentrifugal forces of each system, being necessarily destroyed upon\r\nattainment of a certain proximity to the nucleus of the cluster to which\r\nit belongs, there must occur, at once, a chaotic or seemingly chaotic\r\nprecipitation, of the moons upon the planets, of the planets upon the\r\nsuns, and of the suns upon the nuclei; and the general result of this\r\nprecipitation must be the gathering of the myriad now-existing stars of\r\nthe firmament into an almost infinitely less number of almost infinitely\r\nsuperior spheres. In being immeasurably fewer, the worlds of that day\r\nwill be immeasurably greater than our own. Then, indeed, amid\r\nunfathomable abysses, will be glaring unimaginable suns. But all this\r\nwill be merely a climacic magnificence foreboding the great End. Of this\r\nEnd the new genesis described, can be but a very partial postponement.\r\nWhile undergoing consolidation, the clusters themselves, with a speed\r\nprodigiously accumulative, have been rushing towards their own general\r\ncentre—and now, with a thousand-fold electric velocity, commensurate\r\nonly with their material grandeur and with the spiritual passion of\r\ntheir appetite for oneness, the majestic remnants of the tribe of Stars\r\nflash, at length, into a common embrace. The inevitable catastrophe is\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\nBut this catastrophe—what is it? We have seen accomplished the\r\ningathering of the orbs. Henceforward, are we not to understand _one\r\nmaterial globe of globes_ as constituting and comprehending the\r\nUniverse? Such a fancy would be altogether at war with every assumption\r\nand consideration of this Discourse.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to that absolute _reciprocity of adaptation_\r\nwhich is the idiosyncrasy of the divine Art—stamping it divine. Up to\r\nthis point of our reflections, we have been regarding the electrical\r\ninfluence as a something by dint of whose repulsion alone Matter is\r\nenabled to exist in that state of diffusion demanded for the fulfilment\r\nof its purposes:—so far, in a word, we have been considering the\r\ninfluence in question as ordained for Matter’s sake—to subserve the\r\nobjects of matter. With a perfectly legitimate reciprocity, we are now\r\npermitted to look at Matter, as created _solely for the sake of this\r\ninfluence_—solely to serve the objects of this spiritual Ether. Through\r\nthe aid—by the means—through the agency of Matter, and by dint of its\r\nheterogeneity—is this Ether manifested—is _Spirit individualized_. It is\r\nmerely in the development of this Ether, through heterogeneity, that\r\nparticular masses of Matter become animate—sensitive—and in the ratio of\r\ntheir heterogeneity;—some reaching a degree of sensitiveness involving\r\nwhat we call _Thought_ and thus attaining Conscious Intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn this view, we are enabled to perceive Matter as a Means—not as an\r\nEnd. Its purposes are thus seen to have been comprehended in its\r\ndiffusion; and with the return into Unity these purposes cease. The\r\nabsolutely consolidated globe of globes would be _objectless_:—therefore\r\nnot for a moment could it continue to exist. Matter, created for an end,\r\nwould unquestionably, on fulfilment of that end, be Matter no longer.\r\nLet us endeavor to understand that it would disappear, and that God\r\nwould remain all in all.\r\n\r\nThat every work of Divine conception must cöexist and cöexpire with its\r\nparticular design, seems to me especially obvious; and I make no doubt\r\nthat, on perceiving the final globe of globes to be _objectless_, the\r\nmajority of my readers will be satisfied with my “_therefore_ it cannot\r\ncontinue to exist.” Nevertheless, as the startling thought of its\r\ninstantaneous disappearance is one which the most powerful intellect\r\ncannot be expected readily to entertain on grounds so decidedly\r\nabstract, let us endeavor to look at the idea from some other and more\r\nordinary point of view:—let us see how thoroughly and beautifully it is\r\ncorroborated in an _à posteriori_ consideration of Matter as we actually\r\nfind it.\r\n\r\nI have before said that “Attraction and Repulsion being undeniably the\r\nsole properties by which Matter is manifested to Mind, we are justified\r\nin assuming that Matter _exists_ only as Attraction and Repulsion—in\r\nother words that Attraction and Repulsion _are_ Matter; there being no\r\nconceivable case in which we may not employ the term Matter and the\r\nterms ‘Attraction’ and ‘Repulsion’ taken together, as equivalent, and\r\ntherefore convertible, expressions in Logic.”[14]\r\n\r\n    [14] Page 37.\r\n\r\nNow the very definition of Attraction implies particularity—the\r\nexistence of parts, particles, or atoms; for we define it as the\r\ntendency of “each atom &c. to every other atom” &c. according to a\r\ncertain law. Of course where there are _no_ parts—where there is\r\nabsolute Unity—where the tendency to oneness is satisfied—there can be\r\nno Attraction:—this has been fully shown, and all Philosophy admits it.\r\nWhen, on fulfilment of its purposes, then, Matter shall have returned\r\ninto its original condition of _One_—a condition which presupposes the\r\nexpulsion of the separative ether, whose province and whose capacity are\r\nlimited to keeping the atoms apart until that great day when, this ether\r\nbeing no longer needed, the overwhelming pressure of the finally\r\ncollective Attraction shall at length just sufficiently predominate[15]\r\nand expel it:—when, I say, Matter, finally, expelling the Ether, shall\r\nhave returned into absolute Unity,—it will then (to speak paradoxically\r\nfor the moment) be Matter without Attraction and without Repulsion—in\r\nother words, Matter without Matter—in other words, again, _Matter no\r\nmore_. In sinking into Unity, it will sink at once into that Nothingness\r\nwhich, to all Finite Perception, Unity must be—into that Material\r\nNihility from which alone we can conceive it to have been evoked—to have\r\nbeen _created_ by the Volition of God.\r\n\r\n    [15] “Gravity, therefore, must be the strongest of forces.”—See\r\n    page 39.\r\n\r\nI repeat then—Let us endeavor to comprehend that the final globe of\r\nglobes will instantaneously disappear, and that God will remain all in\r\nall.\r\n\r\nBut are we here to pause? Not so. On the Universal agglomeration and\r\ndissolution, we can readily conceive that a new and perhaps totally\r\ndifferent series of conditions may ensue—another creation and\r\nirradiation, returning into itself—another action and rëaction of the\r\nDivine Will. Guiding our imaginations by that omniprevalent law of laws,\r\nthe law of periodicity, are we not, indeed, more than justified in\r\nentertaining a belief—let us say, rather, in indulging a hope—that the\r\nprocesses we have here ventured to contemplate will be renewed forever,\r\nand forever, and forever; a novel Universe swelling into existence, and\r\nthen subsiding into nothingness, at every throb of the Heart Divine?\r\n\r\nAnd now—this Heart Divine—what is it? _It is our own._\r\n\r\nLet not the merely seeming irreverence of this idea frighten our souls\r\nfrom that cool exercise of consciousness—from that deep tranquillity of\r\nself-inspection—through which alone we can hope to attain the presence\r\nof this, the most sublime of truths, and look it leisurely in the face.\r\n\r\nThe _phænomena_ on which our conclusions must at this point depend, are\r\nmerely spiritual shadows, but not the less thoroughly substantial.\r\n\r\nWe walk about, amid the destinies of our world-existence, encompassed by\r\ndim but ever present _Memories_ of a Destiny more vast—very distant in\r\nthe by-gone time, and infinitely awful.\r\n\r\nWe live out a Youth peculiarly haunted by such dreams; yet never\r\nmistaking them for dreams. As Memories we _know_ them. _During our\r\nYouth_ the distinction is too clear to deceive us even for a moment.\r\n\r\nSo long as this Youth endures, the feeling _that we exist_, is the most\r\nnatural of all feelings. We understand it _thoroughly_. That there was a\r\nperiod at which we did _not_ exist—or, that it might so have happened\r\nthat we never had existed at all—are the considerations, indeed, which\r\n_during this youth_, we find difficulty in understanding. Why we should\r\n_not_ exist, is, _up to the epoch of our Manhood_, of all queries the most\r\nunanswerable. Existence—self-existence—existence from all Time and to\r\nall Eternity—seems, up to the epoch of Manhood, a normal and\r\nunquestionable condition:—_seems, because it is_.\r\n\r\nBut now comes the period at which a conventional World-Reason awakens us\r\nfrom the truth of our dream. Doubt, Surprise and Incomprehensibility\r\narrive at the same moment. They say:—“You live and the time was when you\r\nlived not. You have been created. An Intelligence exists greater than\r\nyour own; and it is only through this Intelligence you live at all.”\r\nThese things we struggle to comprehend and cannot:—_cannot_, because\r\nthese things, being untrue, are thus, of necessity, incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nNo thinking being lives who, at some luminous point of his life of\r\nthought, has not felt himself lost amid the surges of futile efforts at\r\nunderstanding, or believing, that anything exists _greater than his own\r\nsoul_. The utter impossibility of any one’s soul feeling itself inferior\r\nto another; the intense, overwhelming dissatisfaction and rebellion at\r\nthe thought;—these, with the omniprevalent aspirations at perfection,\r\nare but the spiritual, coincident with the material, struggles towards\r\nthe original Unity—are, to my mind at least, a species of proof far\r\nsurpassing what Man terms demonstration, that no one soul _is_ inferior\r\nto another—that nothing is, or can be, superior to any one soul—that\r\neach soul is, in part, its own God—its own Creator:—in a word, that\r\nGod—the material _and_ spiritual God—_now_ exists solely in the diffused\r\nMatter and Spirit of the Universe; and that the regathering of this\r\ndiffused Matter and Spirit will be but the re-constitution of the\r\n_purely_ Spiritual and Individual God.\r\n\r\nIn this view, and in this view alone, we comprehend the riddles of\r\nDivine Injustice—of Inexorable Fate. In this view alone the existence of\r\nEvil becomes intelligible; but in this view it becomes more—it becomes\r\nendurable. Our souls no longer rebel at a _Sorrow_ which we ourselves\r\nhave imposed upon ourselves, in furtherance of our own purposes—with a\r\nview—if even with a futile view—to the extension of our own _Joy_.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of _Memories_ that haunt us during our youth. They\r\nsometimes pursue us even in our Manhood:—assume gradually less and less\r\nindefinite shapes:—now and then speak to us with low voices, saying:\r\n\r\n“There was an epoch in the Night of Time, when a still-existent Being\r\nexisted—one of an absolutely infinite number of similar Beings that\r\npeople the absolutely infinite domains of the absolutely infinite\r\nspace.[16] It was not and is not in the power of this Being—any more\r\nthan it is in your own—to extend, by actual increase, the joy of his\r\nExistence; but just as it _is_ in your power to expand or to concentrate\r\nyour pleasures (the absolute amount of happiness remaining always the\r\nsame) so did and does a similar capability appertain to this Divine\r\nBeing, who thus passes his Eternity in perpetual variation of\r\nConcentrated Self and almost Infinite Self-Diffusion. What you call The\r\nUniverse is but his present expansive existence. He now feels his life\r\nthrough an infinity of imperfect pleasures—the partial and\r\npain-intertangled pleasures of those inconceivably numerous things which\r\nyou designate as his creatures, but which are really but infinite\r\nindividualizations of Himself. All these creatures—_all_—those which you\r\nterm animate, as well as those to whom you deny life for no better\r\nreason than that you do not behold it in operation—_all_ these creatures\r\nhave, in a greater or less degree, a capacity for pleasure and for\r\npain:—_but the general sum of their sensations is precisely that amount\r\nof Happiness which appertains by right to the Divine Being when\r\nconcentrated within Himself_. These creatures are all, too, more or less\r\nconscious Intelligences; conscious, first, of a proper identity;\r\nconscious, secondly and by faint indeterminate glimpses, of an identity\r\nwith the Divine Being of whom we speak—of an identity with God. Of the\r\ntwo classes of consciousness, fancy that the former will grow weaker,\r\nthe latter stronger, during the long succession of ages which must\r\nelapse before these myriads of individual Intelligences become\r\nblended—when the bright stars become blended—into One. Think that the\r\nsense of individual identity will be gradually merged in the general\r\nconsciousness—that Man, for example, ceasing imperceptibly to feel\r\nhimself Man, will at length attain that awfully triumphant epoch when he\r\nshall recognize his existence as that of Jehovah. In the meantime bear\r\nin mind that all is Life—Life—Life within Life—the less within the\r\ngreater, and all within the _Spirit Divine_.”\r\n\r\n    [16] See pages 102-103—Paragraph commencing “I reply that the\r\n    right,” and ending “proper and particular God.”\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n155 Broadway, NEW YORK. 142 Strand, LONDON.\r\n\r\nOf late firm of WILEY & PUTNAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Works in Press,\r\n\r\nOr recently published, by\r\n\r\nGEORGE P. PUTNAM,\r\n\r\n155 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nG. P. PUTNAM has the pleasure of announcing that, agreeably to his\r\ncontract with the distinguished author, he has now in the course of\r\npublication\r\n\r\n_A new, uniform, and complete edition_\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nWorks of Washington Irving,\r\n\r\nRevised and enlarged by the Author,\r\n\r\n_In Twelve Elegant Duodecimo Volumes_,\r\n\r\nBeautifully printed with new type, and on superior paper, made expressly\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first volume of the Series will be\r\n\r\nThe Sketch-Book,\r\n\r\ncomplete in one volume,\r\n\r\nwhich will be ready on the first day of September.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnickerbocker’s History of New York,\r\n\r\nwith revisions and copious additions,\r\n\r\nwill be published on the 1st of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Life and Voyages of Columbus,\r\n\r\nVol. I. on the 1st of November,\r\n\r\nand the succeeding volumes will be issued on the first day of each month\r\nuntil completed;—as follows:\r\n\r\n  _The Sketch-Book, in one volume.\r\n  Knickerbocker’s New York, in one volume.\r\n  Tales of a Traveller, in one volume.\r\n  Bracebridge Hall, in one volume.\r\n  The Conquest of Grenada, in one volume.\r\n  The Alhambra, in one volume.\r\n  The Spanish Legends, in one vol.\r\n  The Crayon Miscellany, in one vol.—Abbotsford, Newstead,\r\n    The Prairies, &c.\r\n  Life and Voyages of Columbus, and The Companions of Columbus, 2 vols.\r\n  Adventures of Captain Bonneville, one vol.\r\n  Astoria, one volume._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Illustrated Sketch-Book.\r\n\r\nIn October will be published,\r\n\r\nThe Sketch-Book.\r\n\r\nBY WASHINGTON IRVING.\r\n\r\nOne volume, square octavo.\r\n\r\nIllustrated with a series of highly-finished Engravings on wood, from\r\nDesigns by Darley and others, engraved in the best style by Childs,\r\nHerrick, &c. This edition will be printed on paper of the finest\r\nquality, similar in size and style to the new edition of “Halleck’s\r\nPoems.” It is intended that the illustrations shall be superior to any\r\nengravings on wood yet produced in this country, and that the mechanical\r\nexecution of the volume, altogether, shall be worthy of the author’s\r\nreputation. It will form an elegant and appropriate gift-book for all\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Illustrated Knickerbocker,\r\n\r\nWith a series of Original Designs, in one vol., octavo, is also in\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Putnam has also the honor to announce that he will publish at\r\nintervals (in connexion, and uniform with the other collected writings),\r\n\r\n_Mr. Irving’s New Works_,\r\n\r\nnow nearly ready for the press: including\r\n\r\nThe Life of Mohammed; The Life of Washington; new volumes of\r\nMiscellanies, Biographies, &c.\r\n\r\n    ⁂ This being the first uniform and complete edition of Mr.\r\n    Irving’s works, either in this country or in Europe, the\r\n    publisher confidently believes that the undertaking will meet\r\n    with a prompt and cordial response. To say this, is perhaps\r\n    superfluous and impertinent; for it is a truism that no\r\n    _American_ book-case (not to say _library_) can be well filled\r\n    without the works of Washington Irving; while the English\r\n    language itself comprises no purer models of composition.\r\n\r\n\r\nG. P. Putnam has also made arrangements for the early commencement of\r\nnew works or new editions of the works of\r\n\r\n  _Miss C. M. Sedgwick,\r\n  Prof. A. Gray,\r\n  Leigh Hunt,\r\n  Chas. Fenno Hoffman,\r\n  Mrs. E. Oakes Smith,\r\n  Thomas Carlyle,\r\n  George H. Calvert,\r\n  Mrs. C. M. Kirkland,\r\n  R. Monckton Milnes,\r\n  J.

(On 1st September.)\r\n\r\nAlso a fine edition in octavo, with illustrations.\r\n\r\n    ⁂ This work has been prepared with great care, illustrated with\r\n    20 effective outline drawings, and is designed to treat the\r\n    subject in an original, comprehensive, and unexceptionable\r\n    manner, so as to fill the place as a text book which is yet\r\n    unsupplied; while it will also be an attractive and readable\r\n    table book for general use. It will be at once introduced as a\r\n    text book in the University of New York and other colleges and\r\n    schools.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nEureka: a Prose Poem.\r\n\r\nOr the Physical and Metaphysical Universe.\r\n\r\nBy Edgar A.

It will be ready in October.\r\n\r\nA new and superior edition of the PEARLS OF AMERICAN POETRY will also be\r\npublished this season.\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe Book of Dainty Devices.\r\n\r\nIn an elegant small folio volume.\r\n\r\nLays of the Western World.\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nDr. Klipstein’s Anglo-Saxon Course of Study.\r\n\r\nIn uniform 12mo. volumes.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nA Grammar of the Anglo-Saxon Language. By Louis F. Klipstein, AA.LL.M.\r\nand PH.D., of the University of Giessen.\r\n\r\n    ⁂ This work recommends itself particularly to the attention of\r\n    every American student who “glories in his Anglo-Saxon descent”\r\n    or Teutonic lineage, as well as of all who desire an\r\n    acquaintance with a language which lies as the foundation of\r\n    the English, and throws a light upon its elements and\r\n    structure, derivable from no other source. Of the importance\r\n    and interesting nature of the study there can be no doubt, and\r\n    we agree with those who think that the time is coming when it\r\n    will be considered “utterly disgraceful for any well-bred\r\n    Englishman or American” to have neglected it. With regard to\r\n    the merits of Dr. Klipstein’s Grammar, we will only say, that\r\n    it has been already adopted as a text-book in some of the\r\n    leading Institutions of our country.\r\n\r\n[The following are also in press.]\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAnalecta Anglo-Saxonica, with an Introductory Ethnographical Essay,\r\nCopious Notes, Critical and Explanatory, and a Glossary in which are\r\nshown the Indo-Germanic and other Affinities of the Language. _By the\r\nsame._\r\n\r\nIn this work appear the fruits of considerable research, and, we may\r\nadd, learning. The Ethnology of Europe is succinctly, but clearly\r\nillustrated, the Anglo-Saxon language completely analysed, revealing the\r\nutmost harmony of combination from its elements, its forms and roots\r\ncompared with those in kindred dialects and cognate tongues, its\r\nposition in the Teutonic family and Indo-Germanic range established, and\r\nthe genuine relation of the English to its great parent properly set\r\nforth. To those who are fond of the comparative study of language, the\r\nGlossary will prove an invaluable aid, apart from its particular object.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nNatale Sancti Gregorii Papæ.—Ælfric’s Homily on the Birth-day of St.\r\nGregory, and Collateral Extracts from King Alfred’s version of Bede’s\r\nEcclesiastical History and the Saxon Chronicle, with a full rendering\r\ninto English, Notes Critical and Explanatory, and an Index of Words. _By\r\nthe same._\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nExtracts from the Anglo-Saxon-Gospels, a Portion of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nParaphrase of the Book of Psalms, and other Selections of a Sacred Order\r\nin the same Language, with a Translation into English, and Notes\r\nCritical and Explanatory. _By the same._\r\n\r\nThese two works are prepared in such a way as in themselves, with the\r\naid of the Grammar, to afford every facility to the Anglo-Saxon Student.\r\nÆlfric’s Homily is remarkable for beauty of composition, and interesting\r\nas setting forth Augustine’s Mission to the “Land of the Angles.”\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTha Halgan Godspel on Englisc—the Anglo-Saxon Version of the Holy\r\nGospels. Edited by Benjamin Thorpe, F.S.A. _Reprinted by the same. Now\r\nready._\r\n\r\nThis, the earliest “English” version of the Four Gospels, will be found\r\ninteresting to the antiquarian and theologian, as well as serviceable to\r\nthe student in his investigations of the language. The Text, besides the\r\nusual but unbroken division, appears, with the Rubrics, as read in the\r\nearly Anglican Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nearly Ready._\r\n\r\nDr. Bosworth’s Compendious Anglo-Saxon Dictionary. Small 8vo.\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nStudy of Modern Languages.\r\n\r\nPart First; French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and English.\r\n\r\nBy L. F. Klipstein, AA.LL.M. and Ph.D. One Vol. Imperial 8vo. 75 cents\r\npaper; $1 00 cloth.\r\n\r\nThis work, which is intended equally for the simultaneous and the\r\nseparate study of the languages that it sets forth, and which is adapted\r\nas well for the native of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, or Portugal, as\r\nfor him to whom English is vernacular, in the acquirement of any one of\r\nthe other tongues besides his own, will be found an acceptable manual\r\nnot only to the tyro, but to the more advanced scholar. The reading\r\nportion of the matter is interesting, and the text in every case\r\nremarkably correct, while the Elementary Phrases, forms of Cards,\r\nLetters, Bills of Exchange, Promissory Notes, Receipts, &c., in the six\r\nlanguages, constitute what has long been a desideratum from the American\r\npress. For the comparative study of the _Romanic_ tongues the work\r\naffords unusual facilities.\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nPedestrian Tour in Europe.\r\n\r\nViews a-Foot; or Europe seen with Knapsack and Staff.\r\n\r\nBy J. Bayard Taylor.\r\n\r\nA new edition with an additional chapter, and a sketch of the author in\r\npedestrian costume, from a drawing by T. Buchanan Read. 12mo. Cloth.\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nA New Edition of\r\n\r\nClarke’s Shakspeare Concordance.\r\n\r\nA Complete Concordance to Shakspeare: being a Verbal Index to ALL the\r\nPASSAGES in the Dramatic Works of the Poet. By Mrs. Cowden Clarke.\r\n\r\n“Order gave each thing view.”\r\n\r\nOne large Vol. comprising 2560 closely printed columns,—(indicating\r\n_every word and passage_ in Shakspeare’s Works). Price $6. Cloth.\r\n\r\n    “The result of sixteen years of untiring labor. The different\r\n    editions of Shakspeare have been carefully collated by the\r\n    compiler, and every possible means taken to insure the\r\n    correctness of the work.

As a mere dictionary of Shakspearian language\r\n    and phrases, it is of great value; but it is also a dictionary\r\n    of his thoughts and imaginations.

This little volume proves that he has well studied\r\n    that subject during his long residence in this his adopted\r\n    country—and his able and valuable opinions on American Society\r\n    and Progress, carry with them a peculiar interest at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT PUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nAlexander.—Commentary on the Earlier Prophecies of Isaiah.

To these I present the composition as an Art-Product alone:—let\nus say as a Romance; or, if I be not urging too lofty a claim, as a\nPoem.\r\n_What I here propound is true_:—therefore it cannot die:—or if by any\nmeans it be now trodden down so that it die, it will “rise again to the\nLife Everlasting.”\n\nNevertheless it is as a Poem only that I wish this work to be judged\nafter I am dead.\n\nE. A. P.\n\n\n\n\nEUREKA:\n\nAN ESSAY ON THE MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL UNIVERSE.\n\n\nIt is with humility really unassumed—it is with a sentiment even of\nawe—that I pen the opening sentence of this work: for of all conceivable\nsubjects I approach the reader with the most solemn—the most","comprehensive—the most difficult—the most august.\n\nWhat terms shall I find sufficiently simple in their\nsublimity—sufficiently sublime in their simplicity—for the mere\nenunciation of my theme?\n\nI design to speak of the _Physical, Metaphysical and Mathematical—of the\nMaterial and Spiritual Universe:—of its Essence, its Origin, its\nCreation, its Present Condition and its Destiny_. I shall be so rash,\nmoreover, as to challenge the conclusions, and thus, in effect, to\nquestion the sagacity, of many of the greatest and most justly\r\nreverenced of men.\n\nIn the beginning, let me as distinctly as possible announce—not the\ntheorem which I hope to demonstrate—for, whatever the mathematicians may\nassert, there is, in this world at least, _no such thing_ as\ndemonstration—but the ruling idea which, throughout this volume, I shall\nbe continually endeavoring to suggest.\n\nMy general proposition, then, is this:—_In the Original Unity of the\nFirst Thing lies the Secondary Cause of All Things, with the Germ of\ntheir Inevitable Annihilation_.\r\nIn illustration of this idea, I propose to take such a survey of the\nUniverse that the mind may be able really to receive and to perceive an\nindividual impression.\n\nHe who from the top of Ætna casts his eyes leisurely around, is affected\nchiefly by the _extent_ and _diversity_ of the scene. Only by a rapid\nwhirling on his heel could he hope to comprehend the panorama in the\nsublimity of its _oneness_. But as, on the summit of Ætna, _no_ man has\nthought of whirling on his heel, so no man has ever taken into his brain\r\nthe full uniqueness of the prospect; and so, again, whatever\nconsiderations lie involved in this uniqueness, have as yet no practical\nexistence for mankind.\n\nI do not know a treatise in which a survey of the _Universe_—using the\nword in its most comprehensive and only legitimate acceptation—is taken\nat all:—and it may be as well here to mention that by the term\n“Universe,” wherever employed without qualification in this essay, I\nmean to designate _the utmost conceivable expanse of space, with all","things, spiritual and material, that can be imagined to exist within the\ncompass of that expanse_. In speaking of what is ordinarily implied by\nthe expression, “Universe,” I shall take a phrase of limitation—“the\nUniverse of stars.” Why this distinction is considered necessary, will\nbe seen in the sequel.\n\nBut even of treatises on the really limited, although always assumed as\nthe _un_limited, Universe of _stars_, I know none in which a survey,\neven of this limited Universe, is so taken as to warrant deductions from\r\nits _individuality_. The nearest approach to such a work is made in the\n“Cosmos” of Alexander Von Humboldt. He presents the subject, however,\n_not_ in its individuality but in its generality. His theme, in its last\nresult, is the law of _each_ portion of the merely physical Universe, as\nthis law is related to the laws of _every other_ portion of this merely\nphysical Universe. His design is simply synœretical. In a word, he\ndiscusses the universality of material relation, and discloses to the\r\neye of Philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden _behind_\nthis universality. But however admirable be the succinctness with which\nhe has treated each particular point of his topic, the mere multiplicity\nof these points occasions, necessarily, an amount of detail, and thus an\ninvolution of idea, which precludes all _individuality_ of impression.\n\nIt seems to me that, in aiming at this latter effect, and, through it,\nat the consequences—the conclusions—the suggestions—the speculations—or,\r\nif nothing better offer itself the mere guesses which may result from\nit—we require something like a mental gyration on the heel. We need so\nrapid a revolution of all things about the central point of sight that,\nwhile the minutiæ vanish altogether, even the more conspicuous objects\nbecome blended into one. Among the vanishing minutiæ, in a survey of\nthis kind, would be all exclusively terrestrial matters. The Earth would\nbe considered in its planetary relations alone. A man, in this view,\nbecomes mankind; mankind a member of the cosmical family of","Intelligences.\n\nAnd now, before proceeding to our subject proper, let me beg the\nreader’s attention to an extract or two from a somewhat remarkable\nletter, which appears to have been found corked in a bottle and floating\non the _Mare Tenebrarum_—an ocean well described by the Nubian\ngeographer, Ptolemy Hephestion, but little frequented in modern days\nunless by the Transcendentalists and some other divers for crotchets.\nThe date of this letter, I confess, surprises me even more particularly\r\nthan its contents; for it seems to have been written in the year _two_\nthousand eight hundred and forty-eight. As for the passages I am about\nto transcribe, they, I fancy, will speak for themselves.\n\n“Do you know, my dear friend,” says the writer, addressing, no doubt, a\ncontemporary—“Do you know that it is scarcely more than eight or nine\nhundred years ago since the metaphysicians first consented to relieve\nthe people of the singular fancy that there exist _but two practicable\nroads to Truth_? Believe it if you can! It appears, however, that long,\r\nlong ago, in the night of Time, there lived a Turkish philosopher called\nAries and surnamed Tottle.” [Here, possibly, the letter-writer means\nAristotle; the best names are wretchedly corrupted in two or three\nthousand years.] “The fame of this great man depended mainly upon his\ndemonstration that sneezing is a natural provision, by means of which\nover-profound thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous ideas through\nthe nose; but he obtained a scarcely less valuable celebrity as the\r\nfounder, or at all events as the principal propagator, of what was\ntermed the _de_ductive or _à priori_ philosophy. He started with what he\nmaintained to be axioms, or self-evident truths:—and the now well\nunderstood fact that _no_ truths are _self_-evident, really does not\nmake in the slightest degree against his speculations:—it was sufficient\nfor his purpose that the truths in question were evident at all. From\naxioms he proceeded, logically, to results. His most illustrious\ndisciples were one Tuclid, a geometrician,” [meaning Euclid] “and one","Kant, a Dutchman, the originator of that species of Transcendentalism\nwhich, with the change merely of a C for a K, now bears his peculiar\nname.\n\n“Well, Aries Tottle flourished supreme, until the advent of one Hog,\nsurnamed ‘the Ettrick shepherd,’ who preached an entirely different\nsystem, which he called the _à posteriori_ or _in_ductive. His plan\nreferred altogether to sensation. He proceeded by observing, analyzing,\nand classifying facts—_instantiæ Naturæ_, as they were somewhat\naffectedly called—and arranging them into general laws. In a word, while\r\nthe mode of Aries rested on _noumena_, that of Hog depended on\n_phenomena_; and so great was the admiration excited by this latter\nsystem that, at its first introduction, Aries fell into general\ndisrepute. Finally, however, he recovered ground, and was permitted to\ndivide the empire of Philosophy with his more modern rival:—the savans\ncontenting themselves with proscribing all _other_ competitors, past,\npresent, and to come; putting an end to all controversy on the topic by\nthe promulgation of a Median law, to the effect that the Aristotelian\r\nand Baconian roads are, and of right ought to be, the solo possible\navenues to knowledge:—‘Baconian,’ you must know, my dear friend,” adds\nthe letter-writer at this point, “was an adjective invented as\nequivalent to Hog-ian, and at the same time more dignified and\neuphonious.\n\n“Now I do assure you most positively”—proceeds the epistle—“that I\nrepresent these matters fairly; and you can easily understand how\nrestrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated, in those\ndays, to retard the progress of true Science, which makes its most\r\nimportant advances—as all History will show—by seemingly intuitive\n_leaps_. These ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling; and I\nneed not suggest to you that crawling, among varieties of locomotion, is\na very capital thing of its kind;—but because the tortoise is sure of\nfoot, for this reason must we clip the wings of the eagles? For many\ncenturies, so great was the infatuation, about Hog especially, that a\nvirtual stop was put to all thinking, properly so called. No man dared","utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone. It\nmattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably such; for the\ndogmatizing philosophers of that epoch regarded only _the road_ by which\nit professed to have been attained. The end, with them, was a point of\nno moment, whatever:—‘the means!’ they vociferated—‘let us look at the\nmeans!’—and if, on scrutiny of the means, it was found to come neither\nunder the category Hog, nor under the category Aries (which means ram),\r\nwhy then the savans went no farther, but, calling the thinker a fool\nand branding him a ‘theorist,’ would never, thenceforward, have any\nthing to do either with _him_ or with his truths.\n\n“Now, my dear friend,” continues the letter-writer, “it cannot be\nmaintained that by the crawling system, exclusively adopted, men would\narrive at the maximum amount of truth, even in any long series of ages;\nfor the repression of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced\neven by _absolute_ certainty in the snail processes. But their certainty\r\nwas very far from absolute. The error of our progenitors was quite\nanalogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies he must necessarily see\nan object the more distinctly, the more closely he holds it to his eyes.\nThey blinded themselves, too, with the impalpable, titillating Scotch\nsnuff of _detail_; and thus the boasted facts of the Hog-ites were by no\nmeans always facts—a point of little importance but for the assumption\nthat they always _were_. The vital taint, however, in Baconianism—its\r\nmost lamentable fount of error—lay in its tendency to throw power and\nconsideration into the hands of merely perceptive men—of those\ninter-Tritonic minnows, the microscopical savans—the diggers and pedlers\nof minute _facts_, for the most part in physical science—facts all of\nwhich they retailed at the same price upon the highway; their value\ndepending, it was supposed, simply upon the _fact of their fact_,\nwithout reference to their applicability or inapplicability in the\ndevelopment of those ultimate and only legitimate facts, called Law.","“Than the persons”—the letter goes on to say—“Than the persons thus\nsuddenly elevated by the Hog-ian philosophy into a station for which\nthey were unfitted—thus transferred from the sculleries into the parlors\nof Science—from its pantries into its pulpits—than these individuals a\nmore intolerant—a more intolerable set of bigots and tyrants never\nexisted on the face of the earth. Their creed, their text and their\nsermon were, alike, the one word ‘_fact_’—but, for the most part, even\r\nof this one word, they knew not even the meaning. On those who ventured\nto _disturb_ their facts with the view of putting them in order and to\nuse, the disciples of Hog had no mercy whatever. All attempts at\ngeneralization were met at once by the words ‘theoretical,’ ‘theory,’\n‘theorist’—all _thought_, to be brief, was very properly resented as a\npersonal affront to themselves. Cultivating the natural sciences to the\nexclusion of Metaphysics, the Mathematics, and Logic, many of these\nBacon-engendered philosophers—one-idead, one-sided and lame of a\r\nleg—were more wretchedly helpless—more miserably ignorant, in view of\nall the comprehensible objects of knowledge, than the veriest unlettered\nhind who proves that he knows something at least, in admitting that he\nknows absolutely nothing.\n\n“Nor had our forefathers any better right to talk about _certainty_,\nwhen pursuing, in blind confidence, the _à priori_ path of axioms, or of\nthe Ram. At innumerable points this path was scarcely as straight as a\nram’s-horn. The simple truth is, that the Aristotelians erected their\r\ncastles upon a basis far less reliable than air; _for no such things as\naxioms ever existed or can possibly exist at all_. This they must have\nbeen very blind, indeed, not to see, or at least to suspect; for, even\nin their own day, many of their long-admitted ‘axioms’ had been\nabandoned:—‘_ex nihilo nihil fit_,’ for example, and a ‘thing cannot act\nwhere it is not,’ and ‘there cannot be antipodes,’ and ‘darkness cannot\nproceed from light.’ These and numerous similar propositions formerly","accepted, without hesitation, as axioms, or undeniable truths, were,\neven at the period of which I speak, seen to be altogether\nuntenable:—how absurd in these people, then, to persist in relying upon\na basis, as immutable, whose mutability had become so repeatedly\nmanifest!\n\n“But, even through evidence afforded by themselves against themselves,\nit is easy to convict these _à priori_ reasoners of the grossest\nunreason—it is easy to show the futility—the impalpability of their\naxioms in general. I have now lying before me”—it will be observed that\r\nwe still proceed with the letter—“I have now lying before me a book\nprinted about a thousand years ago. Pundit assures me that it is\ndecidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, which is ‘Logic.’ The\nauthor, who was much esteemed in his day, was one Miller, or Mill; and\nwe find it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he rode\na mill-horse whom he called Jeremy Bentham:—but let us glance at the\nvolume itself!\n\n“Ah!—‘Ability or inability to conceive,’ says Mr. Mill very properly,\r\n‘is _in no case_ to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth.’ Now,\nthat this is a palpable truism no one in his senses will deny. _Not_ to\nadmit the proposition, is to insinuate a charge of variability in Truth\nitself, whose very title is a synonym of the Steadfast. If ability to\nconceive be taken as a criterion of Truth, then a truth to _David_ Hume\nwould very seldom be a truth to _Joe_; and ninety-nine hundredths of\nwhat is undeniable in Heaven would be demonstrable falsity upon Earth.\r\nThe proposition of Mr. Mill, then, is sustained. I will not grant it to\nbe an _axiom_; and this merely because I am showing that _no_ axioms\nexist; but, with a distinction which could not have been cavilled at\neven by Mr. Mill himself, I am ready to grant that, _if_ an axiom _there\nbe_, then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be\nconsidered an axiom—that no _more_ absolute axiom _is_—and,\nconsequently, that any subsequent proposition which shall conflict with\nthis one primarily advanced, must be either a falsity in itself—that is","to say no axiom—or, if admitted axiomatic, must at once neutralize both\nitself and its predecessor.\n\n“And now, by the logic of their own propounder, let us proceed to test\nany one of the axioms propounded. Let us give Mr. Mill the fairest of\nplay. We will bring the point to no ordinary issue. We will select for\ninvestigation no common-place axiom—no axiom of what, not the less\npreposterously because only impliedly, he terms his secondary class—as\nif a positive truth by definition could be either more or less\r\npositively a truth:—we will select, I say, no axiom of an\nunquestionability so questionable as is to be found in Euclid. We will\nnot talk, for example, about such propositions as that two straight\nlines cannot enclose a space, or that the whole is greater than any one\nof its parts. We will afford the logician _every_ advantage. We will\ncome at once to a proposition which he regards as the acme of the\nunquestionable—as the quintessence of axiomatic undeniability. Here it\nis:—‘Contradictions cannot _both_ be true—that is, cannot cöexist in\r\nnature.’ Here Mr. Mill means, for instance,—and I give the most forcible\ninstance conceivable—that a tree must be either a tree or _not_ a\ntree—that it cannot be at the same time a tree _and_ not a tree:—all\nwhich is quite reasonable of itself and will answer remarkably well as\nan axiom, until we bring it into collation with an axiom insisted upon a\nfew pages before—in other words—words which I have previously\nemployed—until we test it by the logic of its own propounder. ‘A tree,’\nMr. Mill asserts, ‘must be either a tree or _not_ a tree.’ Very\r\nwell:—and now let me ask him, _why_. To this little query there is but\none response:—I defy any man living to invent a second. The sole answer\nis this:—‘Because we find it _impossible to conceive_ that a tree can be\nany thing else than a tree or not a tree.’ This, I repeat, is Mr. Mill’s\nsole answer:—he will not _pretend_ to suggest another:—and yet, by his\nown showing, his answer is clearly no answer at all; for has he not\nalready required us to admit, _as an axiom_, that ability or inability","to conceive is _in no case_ to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic\ntruth? Thus all—absolutely _all_ his argumentation is at sea without a\nrudder. Let it not be urged that an exception from the general rule is\nto be made, in cases where the ‘impossibility to conceive’ is so\npeculiarly great as when we are called upon to conceive a tree _both_ a\ntree and _not_ a tree. Let no attempt, I say, be made at urging this\nsotticism; for, in the first place, there are no _degrees_ of\n‘impossibility,’ and thus no one impossible conception can be _more_\r\npeculiarly impossible than another impossible conception:—in the second\nplace, Mr. Mill himself, no doubt after thorough deliberation, has most\ndistinctly, and most rationally, excluded all opportunity for exception,\nby the emphasis of his proposition, that, _in no case_, is ability or\ninability to conceive, to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic\ntruth:—in the third place, even were exceptions admissible at all, it\nremains to be shown how any exception is admissible _here_. That a tree\r\ncan be both a tree and not a tree, is an idea which the angels, or the\ndevils, _may_ entertain, and which no doubt many an earthly Bedlamite,\nor Transcendentalist, _does_.\n\n“Now I do not quarrel with these ancients,” continues the letter-writer,\n“_so much_ on account of the transparent frivolity of their logic—which,\nto be plain, was baseless, worthless and fantastic altogether—as on\naccount of their pompous and infatuate proscription of all _other_ roads\nto Truth than the two narrow and crooked paths—the one of creeping and\r\nthe other of crawling—to which, in their ignorant perversity, they have\ndared to confine the Soul—the Soul which loves nothing so well as to\nsoar in those regions of illimitable intuition which are utterly\nincognizant of ‘_path_.’\n\n“By the bye, my dear friend, is it not an evidence of the mental slavery\nentailed upon those bigoted people by their Hogs and Rams, that in spite\nof the eternal prating of their savans about _roads_ to Truth, none of\nthem fell, even by accident, into what we now so distinctly perceive to","be the broadest, the straightest and most available of all mere\nroads—the great thoroughfare—the majestic highway of the _Consistent_?\nIs it not wonderful that they should have failed to deduce from the\nworks of God the vitally momentous consideration that _a perfect\nconsistency can be nothing but an absolute truth_? How plain—how rapid\nour progress since the late announcement of this proposition! By its\nmeans, investigation has been taken out of the hands of the ground-moles,\nand given as a duty, rather than as a task, to the true—to the _only_ true\r\nthinkers—to the generally-educated men of ardent imagination. These\nlatter—our Keplers—our Laplaces—‘speculate’—‘theorize’—these are the\nterms—can you not fancy the shout of scorn with which they would be\nreceived by our progenitors, were it possible for them to be looking\nover my shoulders as I write? The Keplers, I repeat, speculate—theorize—and\ntheir theories are merely corrected—reduced—sifted—cleared, little by\nlittle, of their chaff of inconsistency—until at length there stands\r\napparent an unencumbered _Consistency_—a consistency which the most\nstolid admit—because it _is_ a consistency—to be an absolute and an\nunquestionable _Truth_.\n\n“I have often thought, my friend, that it must have puzzled these\ndogmaticians of a thousand years ago, to determine, even, by which of\ntheir two boasted roads it is that the cryptographist attains the\nsolution of the more complicate cyphers—or by which of them Champollion\nguided mankind to those important and innumerable truths which, for so\r\nmany centuries, have lain entombed amid the phonetical hieroglyphics of\nEgypt. In especial, would it not have given these bigots some trouble to\ndetermine by which of their two roads was reached the most momentous and\nsublime of _all_ their truths—the truth—the fact of _gravitation_?\nNewton deduced it from the laws of Kepler. Kepler admitted that these\nlaws he _guessed_—these laws whose investigation disclosed to the\ngreatest of British astronomers that principle, the basis of all\n(existing) physical principle, in going behind which we enter at once","the nebulous kingdom of Metaphysics. Yes!—these vital laws Kepler\n_guessed_—that is to say, he _imagined_ them. Had he been asked to point\nout either the _de_ductive or _in_ductive route by which he attained\nthem, his reply might have been—‘I know nothing about _routes_—but I\n_do_ know the machinery of the Universe. Here it is. I grasped it with\n_my soul_—I reached it through mere dint of _intuition_.’ Alas, poor\nignorant old man! Could not any metaphysician have told him that what he\r\ncalled ‘intuition’ was but the conviction resulting from _de_ductions or\n_in_ductions of which the processes were so shadowy as to have escaped\nhis consciousness, eluded his reason, or bidden defiance to his capacity\nof expression? How great a pity it is that some ‘moral philosopher’ had\nnot enlightened him about all this! How it would have comforted him on\nhis death-bed to know that, instead of having gone intuitively and thus\nunbecomingly, he had, in fact, proceeded decorously and\nlegitimately—that is to say Hog-ishly, or at least Ram-ishly—into the\r\nvast halls where lay gleaming, untended, and hitherto untouched by\nmortal hand—unseen by mortal eye—the imperishable and priceless secrets\nof the Universe!\n\n“Yes, Kepler was essentially a _theorist_; but this title, _now_ of so\nmuch sanctity, was, in those ancient days, a designation of supreme\ncontempt. It is only _now_ that men begin to appreciate that divine old\nman—to sympathize with the prophetical and poetical rhapsody of his\never-memorable words. For _my_ part,” continues the unknown\r\ncorrespondent, “I glow with a sacred fire when I even think of them, and\nfeel that I shall never grow weary of their repetition:—in concluding\nthis letter, let me have the real pleasure of transcribing them once\nagain:—‘_I care not whether my work be read now or by posterity. I can\nafford to wait a century for readers when God himself has waited six\nthousand years for an observer. I triumph. I have stolen the golden\nsecret of the Egyptians. I will indulge my sacred fury._’”\n\nHere end my quotations from this very unaccountable and, perhaps,","somewhat impertinent epistle; and perhaps it would be folly to comment,\nin any respect, upon the chimerical, not to say revolutionary, fancies\nof the writer—whoever he is—fancies so radically at war with the\nwell-considered and well-settled opinions of this age. Let us proceed,\nthen, to our legitimate thesis, _The Universe_.\n\nThis thesis admits a choice between two modes of discussion:—We may\n_as_cend or _de_scend. Beginning at our own point of view—at the Earth\non which we stand—we may pass to the other planets of our system—thence\r\nto the Sun—thence to our system considered collectively—and thence,\nthrough other systems, indefinitely outwards; or, commencing on high at\nsome point as definite as we can make it or conceive it, we may come\ndown to the habitation of Man. Usually—that is to say, in ordinary\nessays on Astronomy—the first of these two modes is, with certain\nreservation, adopted:—this for the obvious reason that astronomical\n_facts_, merely, and principles, being the object, that object is best\nfulfilled in stepping from the known because proximate, gradually onward\r\nto the point where all certitude becomes lost in the remote. For my\npresent purpose, however,—that of enabling the mind to take in, as if\nfrom afar and at one glance, a distinct conception of the _individual_\nUniverse—it is clear that a descent to small from great—to the outskirts\nfrom the centre (if we could establish a centre)—to the end from the\nbeginning (if we could fancy a beginning) would be the preferable\ncourse, but for the difficulty, if not impossibility, of presenting, in\r\nthis course, to the unastronomical, a picture at all comprehensible in\nregard to such considerations as are involved in _quantity_—that is to\nsay, in number, magnitude and distance.\n\nNow, distinctness—intelligibility, at all points, is a primary feature\nin my general design. On important topics it is better to be a good deal\nprolix than even a very little obscure. But abstruseness is a quality\nappertaining to no subject _per se_. All are alike, in facility of\ncomprehension, to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps.","It is merely because a stepping-stone, here and there, is heedlessly\nleft unsupplied in our road to the Differential Calculus, that this\nlatter is not altogether as simple a thing as a sonnet by Mr. Solomon\nSeesaw.\n\nBy way of admitting, then, no _chance_ for misapprehension, I think it\nadvisable to proceed as if even the more obvious facts of Astronomy were\nunknown to the reader. In combining the two modes of discussion to which\nI have referred, I propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar to\r\neach—and very especially of the _iteration in detail_ which will be\nunavoidable as a consequence of the plan. Commencing with a descent, I\nshall reserve for the return upwards those indispensable considerations\nof _quantity_ to which allusion has already been made.\n\nLet us begin, then, at once, with that merest of words, “Infinity.”\nThis, like “God,” “spirit,” and some other expressions of which the\nequivalents exist in all languages, is by no means the expression of an\nidea—but of an effort at one. It stands for the possible attempt at an\r\nimpossible conception. Man needed a term by which to point out the\n_direction_ of this effort—the cloud behind which lay, forever\ninvisible, the _object_ of this attempt. A word, in fine, was demanded,\nby means of which one human being might put himself in relation at once\nwith another human being and with a certain _tendency_ of the human\nintellect. Out of this demand arose the word, “Infinity;” which is thus\nthe representative but of the _thought of a thought_.\n\nAs regards _that_ infinity now considered—the infinity of space—we often\r\nhear it said that “its idea is admitted by the mind—is acquiesced in—is\nentertained—on account of the greater difficulty which attends the\nconception of a limit.” But this is merely one of those _phrases_ by\nwhich even profound thinkers, time out of mind, have occasionally taken\npleasure in deceiving _themselves_. The quibble lies concealed in the\nword “difficulty.” “The mind,” we are told, “entertains the idea of\n_limitless_, through the greater _difficulty_ which it finds in","entertaining that of _limited_, space.” Now, were the proposition but\nfairly _put_, its absurdity would become transparent at once. Clearly,\nthere is no mere _difficulty_ in the case. The assertion intended, if\npresented _according_ to its intention and without sophistry, would run\nthus:—“The mind admits the idea of limitless, through the greater\n_impossibility_ of entertaining that of limited, space.”\n\nIt must be immediately seen that this is not a question of two\nstatements between whose respective credibilities—or of two arguments\r\nbetween whose respective validities—the _reason_ is called upon to\ndecide:—it is a matter of two conceptions, directly conflicting, and\neach avowedly impossible, one of which the _intellect_ is supposed to be\ncapable of entertaining, on account of the greater _impossibility_ of\nentertaining the other. The choice is _not_ made between two\ndifficulties;—it is merely _fancied_ to be made between two\nimpossibilities. Now of the former, there _are_ degrees—but of the\nlatter, none:—just as our impertinent letter-writer has already\r\nsuggested. A task _may_ be more or less difficult; but it is either\npossible or not possible:—there are no gradations. It _might_ be more\n_difficult_ to overthrow the Andes than an ant-hill; but it _can_ be no\nmore _impossible_ to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of\nthe other. A man may jump ten feet with less _difficulty_ than he can\njump twenty, but the _impossibility_ of his leaping to the moon is not a\nwhit less than that of his leaping to the dog-star.\r\nSince all this is undeniable: since the choice of the mind is to be made\nbetween _impossibilities_ of conception: since one impossibility cannot\nbe greater than another: and since, thus, one cannot be preferred to\nanother: the philosophers who not only maintain, on the grounds\nmentioned, man’s _idea_ of infinity but, on account of such\nsupposititious idea, _infinity itself_—are plainly engaged in\ndemonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is\nthat some one other thing—is impossible too. This, it will be said, is","nonsense; and perhaps it is:—indeed I think it very capital\nnonsense—but forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine.\n\nThe readiest mode, however, of displaying the fallacy of the\nphilosophical argument on this question, is by simply adverting to a\n_fact_ respecting it which has been hitherto quite overlooked—the fact\nthat the argument alluded to both proves and disproves its own\nproposition. “The mind is impelled,” say the theologians and others, “to\nadmit a _First Cause_, by the superior difficulty it experiences in\r\nconceiving cause beyond cause without end.” The quibble, as before, lies\nin the word “difficulty”—but _here_ what is it employed to sustain? A\nFirst Cause. And what is a First Cause? An ultimate termination of\ncauses. And what is an ultimate termination of causes? Finity—the\nFinite. Thus the one quibble, in two processes, by God knows how many\nphilosophers, is made to support now Finity and now Infinity—could it\nnot be brought to support something besides? As for the\nquibblers—_they_, at least, are insupportable. But—to dismiss them:—what\r\nthey prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they\ndemonstrate in the other.\n\nOf course, no one will suppose that I here contend for the absolute\nimpossibility of _that_ which we attempt to convey in the word\n“Infinity.” My purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove\nInfinity itself or even our conception of it, by any such blundering\nratiocination as that which is ordinarily employed.\n\nNevertheless, as an individual, I may be permitted to say that _I\ncannot_ conceive Infinity, and am convinced that no human being can. A\r\nmind not thoroughly self-conscious—not accustomed to the introspective\nanalysis of its own operations—will, it is true, often deceive itself by\nsupposing that it _has_ entertained the conception of which we speak. In\nthe effort to entertain it, we proceed step beyond step—we fancy point\nstill beyond point; and so long as we _continue_ the effort, it may be\nsaid, in fact, that we are _tending_ to the formation of the idea\ndesigned; while the strength of the impression that we actually form or","have formed it, is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up\nthe mental endeavor. But it is in the act of discontinuing the\nendeavor—of fulfilling (as we think) the idea—of putting the finishing\nstroke (as we suppose) to the conception—that we overthrow at once the\nwhole fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and\ntherefore definite point. This fact, however, we fail to perceive, on\naccount of the absolute coincidence, in time, between the settling down\nupon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in thinking.—In\r\nattempting, on the other hand, to frame the idea of a _limited_ space,\nwe merely converse the processes which involve the impossibility.\n\nWe _believe_ in a God. We may or may not _believe_ in finite or in\ninfinite space; but our belief, in such cases, is more properly\ndesignated as _faith_, and is a matter quite distinct from that belief\nproper—from that _intellectual_ belief—which presupposes the mental\nconception.\n\nThe fact is, that, upon the enunciation of any one of that class of\r\nterms to which “Infinity” belongs—the class representing _thoughts of\nthought_—he who has a right to say that he thinks _at all_, feels\nhimself called upon, _not_ to entertain a conception, but simply to\ndirect his mental vision toward some given point, in the intellectual\nfirmament, where lies a nebula never to be resolved. To solve it,\nindeed, he makes no effort; for with a rapid instinct he comprehends,\nnot only the impossibility, but, as regards all human purposes, the\n_inessentiality_, of its solution. He perceives that the Deity has not\r\n_designed_ it to be solved. He sees, at once, that it lies _out_ of the\nbrain of man, and even _how_, if not exactly _why_, it lies out of it.\nThere _are_ people, I am aware, who, busying themselves in attempts at\nthe unattainable, acquire very easily, by dint of the jargon they emit,\namong those thinkers-that-they-think with whom darkness and depth are\nsynonymous, a kind of cuttle-fish reputation for profundity; but the\nfinest quality of Thought is its self-cognizance; and, with some little","equivocation, it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater\nthan that which, extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain,\nshuts out even these boundaries themselves from comprehension.\n\nIt will now be understood that, in using the phrase, “Infinity of\nSpace,” I make no call upon the reader to entertain the impossible\nconception of an _absolute_ infinity. I refer simply to the “_utmost\nconceivable expanse_” of space—a shadowy and fluctuating domain, now\nshrinking, now swelling, in accordance with the vacillating energies of\r\nthe imagination.\n\n_Hitherto_, the Universe of stars has always been considered as\ncoincident with the Universe proper, as I have defined it in the\ncommencement of this Discourse. It has been always either directly or\nindirectly assumed—at least since the dawn of intelligible\nAstronomy—that, were it possible for us to attain any given point in\nspace, we should still find, on all sides of us, an interminable\nsuccession of stars. This was the untenable idea of Pascal when making\r\nperhaps the most successful attempt ever made, at periphrasing the\nconception for which we struggle in the word “Universe.” “It is a\nsphere,” he says, “of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference,\nnowhere.” But although this intended definition is, in fact, _no_\ndefinition of the Universe of _stars_, we may accept it, with some\nmental reservation, as a definition (rigorous enough for all practical\npurposes) of the Universe _proper_—that is to say, of the Universe of\n_space_. This latter, then, let us regard as “_a sphere of which the\r\ncentre is everywhere, the circumference nowhere_.” In fact, while we\nfind it impossible to fancy an _end_ to space, we have no difficulty in\npicturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of _beginnings_.\n\nAs our starting-point, then, let us adopt the _Godhead_. Of this\nGodhead, _in itself_, he alone is not imbecile—he alone is not impious\nwho propounds—nothing. “_Nous ne connaissons rien_,” says the Baron de\nBielfeld—“_Nous ne connaissons rien de la nature ou de l’essence de\nDieu:—pour savoir ce qu’il est, il faut être Dieu même._”—“We know","absolutely _nothing_ of the nature or essence of God:—in order to\ncomprehend what he is, we should have to be God ourselves.”\n\n“_We should have to be God ourselves!_”—With a phrase so startling as\nthis yet ringing in my ears, I nevertheless venture to demand if this\nour present ignorance of the Deity is an ignorance to which the soul is\n_everlastingly_ condemned.\n\nBy _Him_, however—_now_, at least, the Incomprehensible—by Him—assuming\nhim as _Spirit_—that is to say, as _not Matter_—a distinction which, for\r\nall intelligible purposes, will stand well instead of a definition—by\nHim, then, existing as Spirit, let us content ourselves, to-night, with\nsupposing to have been _created_, or made out of Nothing, by dint of his\nVolition—at some point of Space which we will take as a centre—at some\nperiod into which we do not pretend to inquire, but at all events\nimmensely remote—by Him, then again, let us suppose to have been\ncreated——_what_? This is a vitally momentous epoch in our\nconsiderations. _What_ is it that we are justified—that alone we are\r\njustified in supposing to have been, primarily and solely, _created_?\n\nWe have attained a point where only _Intuition_ can aid us:—but now let\nme recur to the idea which I have already suggested as that alone which\nwe can properly entertain of intuition. It is but _the conviction\narising from those inductions or deductions of which the processes are\nso shadowy as to escape our consciousness, elude our reason, or defy our\ncapacity of expression_. With this understanding, I now assert—that an\r\nintuition altogether irresistible, although inexpressible, forces me to\nthe conclusion that what God originally created—that that Matter which,\nby dint of his Volition, he first made from his Spirit, or from\nNihility, _could_ have been nothing but Matter in its utmost conceivable\nstate of——what?—of _Simplicity_?\n\nThis will be found the sole absolute _assumption_ of my Discourse. I use\nthe word “assumption” in its ordinary sense; yet I maintain that even\nthis my primary proposition, is very, very far indeed, from being really","a mere assumption. Nothing was ever more certainly—no human conclusion\nwas ever, in fact, more regularly—more rigorously _de_duced:—but, alas!\nthe processes lie out of the human analysis—at all events are beyond the\nutterance of the human tongue.\n\nLet us now endeavor to conceive what Matter must be, when, or if, in its\nabsolute extreme of _Simplicity_. Here the Reason flies at once to\nImparticularity—to a particle—to _one_ particle—a particle of _one_\nkind—of _one_ character—of _one_ nature—of _one size_—of one form—a\r\nparticle, therefore, “_without_ form and void”—a particle positively a\nparticle at all points—a particle absolutely unique, individual,\nundivided, and not indivisible only because He who _created_ it, by dint\nof his Will, can by an infinitely less energetic exercise of the same\nWill, as a matter of course, divide it.\n\n_Oneness_, then, is all that I predicate of the originally created\nMatter; but I propose to show that this _Oneness is a principle\nabundantly sufficient to account for the constitution, the existing\r\nphænomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the\nmaterial Universe_.\n\nThe willing into being the primordial particle, has completed the act,\nor more properly the _conception_, of Creation. We now proceed to the\nultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the Particle created—that\nis to say, the ultimate purpose so far as our considerations _yet_\nenable us to see it—the constitution of the Universe from it, the\nParticle.\n\nThis constitution has been effected by _forcing_ the originally and\r\ntherefore normally _One_ into the abnormal condition of _Many_. An\naction of this character implies rëaction. A diffusion from Unity, under\nthe conditions, involves a tendency to return into Unity—a tendency\nineradicable until satisfied. But on these points I will speak more\nfully hereafter.\n\nThe assumption of absolute Unity in the primordial Particle includes\nthat of infinite divisibility. Let us conceive the Particle, then, to be\nonly not totally exhausted by diffusion into Space. From the one\nParticle, as a centre, let us suppose to be irradiated spherically—in","all directions—to immeasurable but still to definite distances in the\npreviously vacant space—a certain inexpressibly great yet limited number\nof unimaginably yet not infinitely minute atoms.\n\nNow, of these atoms, thus diffused, or upon diffusion, what conditions\nare we permitted—not to assume, but to infer, from consideration as well\nof their source as of the character of the design apparent in their\ndiffusion? _Unity_ being their source, and _difference from Unity_ the\r\ncharacter of the design manifested in their diffusion, we are warranted\nin supposing this character to be at least _generally_ preserved\nthroughout the design, and to form a portion of the design itself:—that\nis to say, we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at\nall points from the uniquity and simplicity of the origin. But, for\nthese reasons, shall we be justified in imagining the atoms\nheterogeneous, dissimilar, unequal, and inequidistant? More\nexplicitly—are we to consider no two atoms as, at their diffusion, of\r\nthe same nature, or of the same form, or of the same size?—and, after\nfulfilment of their diffusion into Space, is absolute inequidistance,\neach from each, to be understood of all of them? In such arrangement,\nunder such conditions, we most easily and immediately comprehend the\nsubsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design\nas that which I have suggested—the design of variety out of\nunity—diversity out of sameness—heterogeneity out of\nhomogeneity—complexity out of simplicity—in a word, the utmost possible\r\nmultiplicity of _relation_ out of the emphatically irrelative _One_.\nUndoubtedly, therefore, we _should_ be warranted in assuming all that\nhas been mentioned, but for the reflection, first, that supererogation\nis not presumable of any Divine Act; and, secondly, that the object\nsupposed in view, appears as feasible when some of the conditions in\nquestion are dispensed with, in the beginning, as when all are\nunderstood immediately to exist. I mean to say that some are involved in\nthe rest, or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the","distinction inappreciable. Difference of _size_, for example, will at\nonce be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second, in\npreference to a third, on account of particular inequidistance; which is\nto be comprehended as _particular inequidistances between centres of\nquantity, in neighboring atoms of different form_—a matter not at all\ninterfering with the generally-equable distribution of the atoms.\nDifference of _kind_, too, is easily conceived to be merely a result of\r\ndifferences in size and form, taken more or less conjointly:—in fact,\nsince the _Unity_ of the Particle Proper implies absolute homogeneity,\nwe cannot imagine the atoms, at their diffusion, differing in kind,\nwithout imagining, at the same time, a special exercise of the Divine\nWill, at the emission of each atom, for the purpose of effecting, in\neach, a change of its essential nature:—so fantastic an idea is the\nless to be indulged, as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly\nattainable without such minute and elaborate interposition. We perceive,\r\ntherefore, upon the whole, that it would be supererogatory, and\nconsequently unphilosophical, to predicate of the atoms, in view of\ntheir purposes, any thing more than _difference of form_ at their\ndispersion, with particular inequidistance after it—all other\ndifferences arising at once out of these, in the very first processes of\nmass-constitution:—We thus establish the Universe on a purely\n_geometrical_ basis. Of course, it is by no means necessary to assume\nabsolute difference, even of form, among _all_ the atoms irradiated—any\r\nmore than absolute particular inequidistance of each from each. We are\nrequired to conceive merely that no _neighboring_ atoms are of similar\nform—no atoms which can ever approximate, until their inevitable\nrëunition at the end.\n\nAlthough the immediate and perpetual _tendency_ of the disunited atoms\nto return into their normal Unity, is implied, as I have said, in their\nabnormal diffusion; still it is clear that this tendency will be without\nconsequence—a tendency and no more—until the diffusive energy, in","ceasing to be exerted, shall leave _it_, the tendency, free to seek its\nsatisfaction. The Divine Act, however, being considered as determinate,\nand discontinued on fulfilment of the diffusion, we understand, at once,\na _rëaction_—in other words, a _satisfiable_ tendency of the disunited\natoms to return into _One_.\n\nBut the diffusive energy being withdrawn, and the rëaction having\ncommenced in furtherance of the ultimate design—_that of the utmost\npossible Relation_—this design is now in danger of being frustrated, in\r\ndetail, by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect its\naccomplishment in general. _Multiplicity_ is the object; but there is\nnothing to prevent proximate atoms, from lapsing _at once_, through the\nnow satisfiable tendency—_before_ the fulfilment of any ends proposed in\nmultiplicity—into absolute oneness among themselves:—there is nothing to\nimpede the aggregation of various _unique_ masses, at various points of\nspace:—in other words, nothing to interfere with the accumulation of\nvarious masses, each absolutely One.\r\nFor the effectual and thorough completion of the general design, we thus\nsee the necessity for a repulsion of limited capacity—a separative\n_something_ which, on withdrawal of the diffusive Volition, shall at the\nsame time allow the approach, and forbid the junction, of the atoms;\nsuffering them infinitely to approximate, while denying them positive\ncontact; in a word, having the power—_up to a certain epoch_—of\npreventing their _coalition_, but no ability to interfere with their\r\n_coalescence_ in any respect _or degree_. The repulsion, already\nconsidered as so peculiarly limited in other regards, must be\nunderstood, let me repeat, as having power to prevent absolute\ncoalition, _only up to a certain epoch_. Unless we are to conceive that\nthe appetite for Unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied\n_never_;—unless we are to conceive that what had a beginning is to have\nno end—a conception which cannot _really_ be entertained, however much\nwe may talk or dream of entertaining it—we are forced to conclude that","the repulsive influence imagined, will, finally—under pressure of the\n_Unitendency collectively_ applied, but never and in no degree _until_,\non fulfilment of the Divine purposes, such collective application shall\nbe naturally made—yield to a force which, at that ultimate epoch, shall\nbe the superior force precisely to the extent required, and thus permit\nthe universal subsidence into the inevitable, because original and\ntherefore normal, _One_.—The conditions here to be reconciled are\ndifficult indeed:—we cannot even comprehend the possibility of their\r\nconciliation;—nevertheless, the apparent impossibility is brilliantly\nsuggestive.\n\nThat the repulsive something actually exists, _we see_. Man neither\nemploys, nor knows, a force sufficient to bring two atoms into contact.\nThis is but the well-established proposition of the impenetrability of\nmatter. All Experiment proves—all Philosophy admits it. The _design_ of\nthe repulsion—the necessity for its existence—I have endeavored to show;\nbut from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously\r\nabstained; this on account of an intuitive conviction that the principle\nat issue is strictly spiritual—lies in a recess impervious to our\npresent understanding—lies involved in a consideration of what now—in\nour human state—is _not_ to be considered—in a consideration of _Spirit\nin itself_. I feel, in a word, that here the God has interposed, and\nhere only, because here and here only the knot demanded the\ninterposition of the God.\n\nIn fact, while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into Unity,\r\nwill be recognized, at once, as the principle of the Newtonian Gravity,\nwhat I have spoken of as a repulsive influence prescribing limits to the\n(immediate) satisfaction of the tendency, will be understood as _that_\nwhich we have been in the practice of designating now as heat, now as\nmagnetism, now as _electricity_; displaying our ignorance of its awful\ncharacter in the vacillation of the phraseology with which we endeavor\nto circumscribe it.\n\nCalling it, merely for the moment, electricity, we know that all","experimental analysis of electricity has given, as an ultimate result,\nthe principle, or seeming principle, _heterogeneity_. _Only_ where\nthings differ is electricity apparent; and it is presumable that they\n_never_ differ where it is not developed at least, if not apparent. Now,\nthis result is in the fullest keeping with that which I have reached\nunempirically. The design of the repulsive influence I have maintained\nto be that of preventing immediate Unity among the diffused atoms; and\r\nthese atoms are represented as different each from each. _Difference_ is\ntheir character—their essentiality—just as _no-difference_ was the\nessentiality of their source. When we say, then, that an attempt to\nbring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort, on the\npart of the repulsive influence, to prevent the contact, we may as well\nuse the strictly convertible sentence that an attempt to bring together\nany two differences will result in a development of electricity. All\nexisting bodies, of course, are composed of these atoms in proximate\r\ncontact, and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more\nor fewer differences; and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit,\non bringing together any two such assemblages, would be in the ratio of\nthe two sums of the differences in each:—an expression which, when\nreduced, is equivalent to this:—_The amount of electricity developed on\nthe approximation of two bodies, is proportional to the difference\nbetween the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are\ncomposed._ That _no_ two bodies are absolutely alike, is a simple\r\ncorollary from all that has been here said. Electricity, therefore,\nexisting always, is _developed_ whenever _any_ bodies, but _manifested_\nonly when bodies of appreciable difference, are brought into\napproximation.\n\nTo electricity—so, for the present, continuing to call it—we _may_ not\nbe wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light, heat\nand magnetism; but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to\nthis strictly spiritual principle the more important phænomena of","vitality, consciousness and _Thought_. On this topic, however, I need\npause _here_ merely to suggest that these phænomena, whether observed\ngenerally or in detail, seem to proceed _at least in the ratio of the\nheterogeneous_.\n\nDiscarding now the two equivocal terms, “gravitation” and “electricity,”\nlet us adopt the more definite expressions, “_attraction_” and\n“_repulsion_.” The former is the body; the latter the soul: the one is\nthe material; the other the spiritual, principle of the Universe. _No\r\nother principles exist._ _All_ phænomena are referable to one, or to the\nother, or to both combined. So rigorously is this the case—so thoroughly\ndemonstrable is it that attraction and repulsion are the _sole_\nproperties through which we perceive the Universe—in other words, by\nwhich Matter is manifested to Mind—that, for all merely argumentative\npurposes, we are fully justified in assuming that matter _exists_ only\nas attraction and repulsion—that attraction and repulsion _are_\nmatter:—there being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the\r\nterm “matter” and the terms “attraction” and “repulsion,” taken\ntogether, as equivalent, and therefore convertible, expressions in\nLogic.\n\nI said, just now, that what I have described as the tendency of the\ndiffused atoms to return into their original unity, would be understood\nas the principle of the Newtonian law of gravity: and, in fact, there\ncan be little difficulty in such an understanding, if we look at the\nNewtonian gravity in a merely general view, as a force impelling matter\r\nto seek matter; that is to say, when we pay no attention to the known\n_modus operandi_ of the Newtonian force. The general coincidence\nsatisfies us; but, upon looking closely, we see, in detail, much that\nappears _in_coincident, and much in regard to which no coincidence, at\nleast, is established. For example; the Newtonian gravity, when we think\nof it in certain moods, does _not_ seem to be a tendency to _oneness_ at\nall, but rather a tendency of all bodies in all directions—a phrase\napparently expressive of a tendency to diffusion. Here, then, is an","_in_coincidence. Again; when we reflect on the mathematical _law_\ngoverning the Newtonian tendency, we see clearly that no coincidence has\nbeen made good, in respect of the _modus operandi_, at least, between\ngravitation as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct\ntendency which I have assumed.\n\nIn fact, I have attained a point at which it will be advisable to\nstrengthen my position by reversing my processes. So far, we have gone\non _à priori_, from an abstract consideration of _Simplicity_, as that\r\nquality most likely to have characterized the original action of God.\nLet us now see whether the established facts of the Newtonian\nGravitation may not afford us, _à posteriori_, some legitimate\ninductions.\n\nWhat does the Newtonian law declare?—That all bodies attract each other\nwith forces proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely\nproportional to the squares of their distances. Purposely, I have here\ngiven, in the first place, the vulgar version of the law; and I confess\r\nthat in this, as in most other vulgar versions of great truths, we find\nlittle of a suggestive character. Let us now adopt a more philosophical\nphraseology:—_Every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both\nof its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely\nas the squares of the distances between the attracting and attracted\natom._—Here, indeed, a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind.\n\nBut let us see distinctly what it was that Newton _proved_—according to\r\nthe grossly irrational definitions of _proof_ prescribed by the\nmetaphysical schools. He was forced to content himself with showing how\nthoroughly the motions of an imaginary Universe, composed of attracting\nand attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced, coincide with\nthose of the actually existing Universe so far as it comes under our\nobservation. This was the amount of his _demonstration_—that is to say,\nthis was the amount of it, according to the conventional cant of the\n“philosophies.” His successes added proof multiplied by proof—such proof","as a sound intellect admits—but the _demonstration_ of the law itself,\npersist the metaphysicians, had not been strengthened in any degree.\n“_Ocular_, _physical_ proof,” however, of attraction, here upon Earth,\nin accordance with the Newtonian theory, was, at length, much to the\nsatisfaction of some intellectual grovellers, afforded. This proof arose\ncollaterally and incidentally (as nearly all important truths have\narisen) out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the Earth. In\nthe famous Maskelyne, Cavendish and Bailly experiments for this purpose,\r\nthe attraction of the mass of a mountain was seen, felt, measured, and\nfound to be mathematically consistent with the immortal theory of the\nBritish astronomer.\n\nBut in spite of this confirmation of that which needed none—in spite of\nthe so-called corroboration of the “theory” by the so-called “ocular and\nphysical proof”—in spite of the _character_ of this corroboration—the\nideas which even really philosophical men cannot help imbibing of\ngravity—and, especially, the ideas of it which ordinary men get and\r\ncontentedly maintain, are _seen_ to have been derived, for the most\npart, from a consideration of the principle as they find it\ndeveloped—_merely in the planet upon which they stand_.\n\nNow, to what does so partial a consideration tend—to what species of\nerror does it give rise? On the Earth we _see_ and _feel_, only that\ngravity impels all bodies towards the _centre_ of the Earth. No man in\nthe common walks of life could be _made_ to see or to feel anything\nelse—could be made to perceive that anything, anywhere, has a perpetual,\r\ngravitating tendency in any _other_ direction than to the centre of the\nEarth; yet (with an exception hereafter to be specified) it is a fact\nthat every earthly thing (not to speak now of every heavenly thing) has\na tendency not _only_ to the Earth’s centre but in every conceivable\ndirection besides.\n\nNow, although the philosophic cannot be said to _err with_ the vulgar in\nthis matter, they nevertheless permit themselves to be influenced,\nwithout knowing it, by the _sentiment_ of the vulgar idea. “Although the","Pagan fables are not believed,” says Bryant, in his very erudite\n“Mythology,” “yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences\nfrom them as from existing realities.” I mean to assert that the merely\n_sensitive perception_ of gravity as we experience it on Earth, beguiles\nmankind into the fancy of _concentralization_ or _especiality_\nrespecting it—has been continually biasing towards this fancy even the\nmightiest intellects—perpetually, although imperceptibly, leading them\r\naway from the real characteristics of the principle; thus preventing\nthem, up to this date, from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth\nwhich lies in a diametrically opposite direction—behind the principle’s\n_essential_ characteristics—those, _not_ of concentralization or\nespeciality—but of _universality_ and _diffusion_. This “vital truth” is\n_Unity_ as the _source_ of the phænomenon.\n\nLet me now repeat the definition of gravity:—_Every atom, of every body,\nattracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body_,\r\nwith a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of\nthe attracting and attracted atom.\n\nHere let the reader pause with me, for a moment, in contemplation of the\nmiraculous—of the ineffable—of the altogether unimaginable complexity of\nrelation involved in the fact that _each atom attracts every other\natom_—involved merely in this fact of the attraction, without reference\nto the law or mode in which the attraction is manifested—involved\n_merely_ in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom _at all_,\r\nin a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the\ncomposition of a cannon-ball, exceed, probably, in mere point of number,\nall the stars which go to the constitution of the Universe.\n\nHad we discovered, simply, that each atom tended to some one favorite\npoint—to some especially attractive atom—we should still have fallen\nupon a discovery which, in itself, would have sufficed to overwhelm the\nmind:—but what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend?\nThat each atom attracts—sympathizes with the most delicate movements of","every other atom, and with each and with all at the same time, and\nforever, and according to a determinate law of which the complexity,\neven considered by itself solely, is utterly beyond the grasp of the\nimagination of man. If I propose to ascertain the influence of one mote\nin a sunbeam upon its neighboring mote, I cannot accomplish my purpose\nwithout first counting and weighing all the atoms in the Universe and\ndefining the precise positions of all at one particular moment. If I\nventure to displace, by even the billionth part of an inch, the\r\nmicroscopical speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my finger,\nwhat is the character of that act upon which I have adventured? I have\ndone a deed which shakes the Moon in her path, which causes the Sun to\nbe no longer the Sun, and which alters forever the destiny of the\nmultitudinous myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic\npresence of their Creator.\n\n_These_ ideas—conceptions such as _these_—unthoughtlike\nthoughts—soul-reveries rather than conclusions or even considerations\r\nof the intellect:—ideas, I repeat, such as these, are such as we can\nalone hope profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great\nprinciple, _Attraction_.\n\nBut now,—_with_ such ideas—with such a _vision_ of the marvellous\ncomplexity of Attraction fairly in his mind—let any person competent of\nthought on such topics as these, set himself to the task of imagining a\n_principle_ for the phænomena observed—a condition from which they\nsprang.\n\nDoes not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common\r\nparentage? Does not a sympathy so omniprevalent, so ineradicable, and so\nthoroughly irrespective, suggest a common paternity as its source? Does\nnot one extreme impel the reason to the other? Does not the infinitude\nof division refer to the utterness of individuality? Does not the\nentireness of the complex hint at the perfection of the simple? It is\n_not_ that the atoms, as we see them, are divided or that they are\ncomplex in their relations—but that they are inconceivably divided and","unutterably complex:—it is the extremeness of the conditions to which I\nnow allude, rather than to the conditions themselves. In a word, is it\nnot because the atoms were, at some remote epoch of time, even _more\nthan together_—is it not because originally, and therefore normally,\nthey were _One_—that now, in all circumstances—at all points—in all\ndirections—by all modes of approach—in all relations and through all\nconditions—they struggle _back_ to this absolutely, this irrelatively,\nthis unconditionally _one_?\r\nSome person may here demand:—“Why—since it is to the _One_ that the\natoms struggle back—do we not find and define Attraction ‘a merely\ngeneral tendency to a centre?’—why, in especial, do not _your_\natoms—the atoms which you describe as having been irradiated from a\ncentre—proceed at once, rectilinearly, back to the central point of\ntheir origin?”\n\nI reply that _they do_; as will be distinctly shown; but that the cause\nof their so doing is quite irrespective of the centre _as such_. They\r\nall tend rectilinearly towards a centre, because of the sphereicity with\nwhich they have been irradiated into space. Each atom, forming one of a\ngenerally uniform globe of atoms, finds more atoms in the direction of\nthe centre, of course, than in any other, and in that direction,\ntherefore, is impelled—but is _not_ thus impelled because the centre is\n_the point of its origin_. It is not to any _point_ that the atoms are\nallied. It is not any _locality_, either in the concrete or in the\nabstract, to which I suppose them bound. Nothing like _location_ was\r\nconceived as their origin. Their source lies in the principle, _Unity_.\n_This_ is their lost parent. _This_ they seek always—immediately—in all\ndirections—wherever it is even partially to be found; thus appeasing, in\nsome measure, the ineradicable tendency, while on the way to its\nabsolute satisfaction in the end. It follows from all this, that any\nprinciple which shall be adequate to account for the _law_, or _modus\noperandi_, of the attractive force in general, will account for this law","in particular:—that is to say, any principle which will show why the\natoms should tend to their _general centre of irradiation_ with forces\ninversely proportional to the squares of the distances, will be admitted\nas satisfactorily accounting, at the same time, for the tendency,\naccording to the same law, of these atoms each to each:—_for_ the\ntendency to the centre _is_ merely the tendency each to each, and not\nany tendency to a centre as such.—Thus it will be seen, also, that the\nestablishment of my propositions would involve no _necessity_ of\r\nmodification in the terms of the Newtonian definition of Gravity, which\ndeclares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth, and\ndeclares this merely; but (always under the supposition that what I\npropose be, in the end, admitted) it seems clear that some error might\noccasionally be avoided, in the future processes of Science, were a more\nample phraseology adopted:—for instance:—“Each atom tends to every other\natom &c. with a force &c.: _the general result being a tendency of all,\r\nwith a similar force, to a general centre_.”\n\nThe reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical\nresult; but, while in the one process _intuition_ was the\nstarting-point, in the other it was the goal. In commencing the former\njourney I could only say that, with an irresistible intuition, I _felt_\nSimplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of\nGod:—in ending the latter I can only declare that, with an irresistible\nintuition, I perceive Unity to have been the source of the observed\r\nphænomena of the Newtonian gravitation. Thus, according to the schools,\nI _prove_ nothing. So be it:—I design but to suggest—and to _convince_\nthrough the suggestion. I am proudly aware that there exist many of the\nmost profound and cautiously discriminative human intellects which\ncannot _help_ being abundantly content with my—suggestions. To these\nintellects—as to my own—there is no mathematical demonstration which\n_could_ bring the least additional _true proof_ of the great _Truth_\nwhich I have advanced—_the truth of Original Unity as the source—as the","principle of the Universal Phænomena_. For my part, I am not so sure\nthat I speak and see—I am not so sure that my heart beats and that my\nsoul lives:—of the rising of to-morrow’s sun—a probability that as yet\nlies in the Future—I do not pretend to be one thousandth part as sure—as\nI am of the irretrievably by-gone _Fact_ that All Things and All\nThoughts of Things, with all their ineffable Multiplicity of Relation,\nsprang at once into being from the primordial and irrelative _One_.\n\nReferring to the Newtonian Gravity, Dr. Nichol, the eloquent author of\r\n“The Architecture of the Heavens,” says:—“In truth we have no reason to\nsuppose this great Law, as now revealed, to be the ultimate or simplest,\nand therefore the universal and all-comprehensive, form of a great\nOrdinance. The mode in which its intensity diminishes with the element\nof distance, has not the aspect of an ultimate _principle_; which always\nassumes the simplicity and self-evidence of those axioms which\nconstitute the basis of Geometry.”\n\nNow, it is quite true that “ultimate principles,” in the common\r\nunderstanding of the words, always assume the simplicity of geometrical\naxioms—(as for “self-evidence,” there is no such thing)—but these\nprinciples are clearly _not_ “ultimate;” in other terms what we are in\nthe habit of calling principles are no principles, properly\nspeaking—since there can be but one _principle_, the Volition of God. We\nhave no right to assume, then, from what we observe in rules that we\nchoose foolishly to name “principles,” anything at all in respect to the\ncharacteristics of a principle proper. The “ultimate principles” of\r\nwhich Dr. Nichol speaks as having geometrical simplicity, may and do\nhave this geometrical turn, as being part and parcel of a vast\ngeometrical system, and thus a system of simplicity itself—in which,\nnevertheless, the _truly_ ultimate principle is, _as we know_, the\nconsummation of the complex—that is to say, of the unintelligible—for is\nit not the Spiritual Capacity of God?\n\nI quoted Dr. Nichol’s remark, however, not so much to question its\nphilosophy, as by way of calling attention to the fact that, while all","men have admitted _some_ principle as existing behind the Law of\nGravity, no attempt has been yet made to point out what this principle\nin particular _is_:—if we except, perhaps, occasional fantastic efforts\nat referring it to Magnetism, or Mesmerism, or Swedenborgianism, or\nTranscendentalism, or some other equally delicious _ism_ of the same\nspecies, and invariably patronized by one and the same species of\npeople. The great mind of Newton, while boldly grasping the Law itself,\nshrank from the principle of the Law. The more fluent and comprehensive\r\nat least, if not the more patient and profound, sagacity of Laplace, had\nnot the courage to attack it. But hesitation on the part of these two\nastronomers it is, perhaps, not so very difficult to understand. They,\nas well as all the first class of mathematicians, were mathematicians\n_solely_:—their intellect, at least, had a firmly-pronounced\nmathematico-physical tone. What lay not distinctly within the domain of\nPhysics, or of Mathematics, seemed to them either Non-Entity or Shadow.\r\nNevertheless, we may well wonder that Leibnitz, who was a marked\nexception to the general rule in these respects, and whose mental\ntemperament was a singular admixture of the mathematical with the\nphysico-metaphysical, did not at once investigate and establish the\npoint at issue. Either Newton or Laplace, seeking a principle and\ndiscovering none _physical_, would have rested contentedly in the\nconclusion that there was absolutely none; but it is almost impossible\nto fancy, of Leibnitz, that, having exhausted in his search the physical\r\ndominions, he would not have stepped at once, boldly and hopefully, amid\nhis old familiar haunts in the kingdom of Metaphysics. Here, indeed, it\nis clear that he _must_ have adventured in search of the treasure:—that\nhe did not find it after all, was, perhaps, because his fairy guide,\nImagination, was not sufficiently well-grown, or well-educated, to\ndirect him aright.\n\nI observed, just now, that, in fact, there had been certain vague\nattempts at referring Gravity to some very uncertain _isms_. These","attempts, however, although considered bold and justly so considered,\nlooked no farther than to the generality—the merest generality—of the\nNewtonian Law. Its _modus operandi_ has never, to my knowledge, been\napproached in the way of an effort at explanation. It is, therefore,\nwith no unwarranted fear of being taken for a madman at the outset, and\nbefore I can bring my propositions fairly to the eye of those who alone\nare competent to decide upon them, that I here declare the _modus\noperandi_ of the Law of Gravity to be an exceedingly simple and\r\nperfectly explicable thing—that is to say, when we make our advances\ntowards it in just gradations and in the true direction—when we regard\nit from the proper point of view.\n\nWhether we reach the idea of absolute _Unity_ as the source of All\nThings, from a consideration of Simplicity as the most probable\ncharacteristic of the original action of God;—whether we arrive at it\nfrom an inspection of the universality of relation in the gravitating\nphænomena;—or whether we attain it as a result of the mutual\r\ncorroboration afforded by both processes;—still, the idea itself, if\nentertained at all, is entertained in inseparable connection with\nanother idea—that of the condition of the Universe of stars as we _now_\nperceive it—that is to say, a condition of immeasurable _diffusion_\nthrough space. Now a connection between these two ideas—unity and\ndiffusion—cannot be established unless through the entertainment of a\nthird idea—that of _irradiation_. Absolute Unity being taken as a\r\ncentre, then the existing Universe of stars is the result of\n_irradiation_ from that centre.\n\nNow, the laws of irradiation are _known_. They are part and parcel of\nthe _sphere_. They belong to the class of _indisputable geometrical\nproperties_. We say of them, “they are true—they are evident.” To demand\n_why_ they are true, would be to demand why the axioms are true upon\nwhich their demonstration is based. _Nothing_ is demonstrable, strictly\nspeaking; but _if_ anything _be_, then the properties—the laws in\nquestion are demonstrated.","But these laws—what do they declare? Irradiation—how—by what steps does\nit proceed outwardly from a centre?\n\nFrom a _luminous_ centre, _Light_ issues by irradiation; and the\nquantities of light received upon any given plane, supposed to be\nshifting its position so as to be now nearer the centre and now farther\nfrom it, will be diminished in the same proportion as the squares of the\ndistances of the plane from the luminous body, are increased; and will\nbe increased in the same proportion as these squares are diminished.\r\nThe expression of the law may be thus generalized:—the number of\nlight-particles (or, if the phrase be preferred, the number of\nlight-impressions) received upon the shifting plane, will be _inversely_\nproportional with the squares of the distances of the plane.\nGeneralizing yet again, we may say that the diffusion—the scattering—the\nirradiation, in a word—is _directly_ proportional with the squares of\nthe distances.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFor example: at the distance B, from the luminous centre A, a certain\r\nnumber of particles are so diffused as to occupy the surface B. Then at\ndouble the distance—that is to say at C—they will be so much farther\ndiffused as to occupy four such surfaces:—at treble the distance, or at\nD, they will be so much farther separated as to occupy nine such\nsurfaces:—while, at quadruple the distance, or at E, they will have\nbecome so scattered as to spread themselves over sixteen such\nsurfaces—and so on forever.\n\nIn saying, generally, that the irradiation proceeds in direct proportion\r\nwith the squares of the distances, we use the term irradiation to\nexpress _the degree of the diffusion_ as we proceed outwardly from the\ncentre. Conversing the idea, and employing the word “concentralization”\nto express _the degree of the drawing together_ as we come back toward\nthe centre from an outward position, we may say that concentralization\nproceeds _inversely_ as the squares of the distances. In other words, we\nhave reached the conclusion that, on the hypothesis that matter was\noriginally irradiated from a centre and is now returning to it, the","concentralization, in the return, proceeds _exactly as we know the force\nof gravitation to proceed_.\n\nNow here, if we could be permitted to assume that concentralization\nexactly represented the _force of the tendency to the centre_—that the\none was exactly proportional to the other, and that the two proceeded\ntogether—we should have shown all that is required. The sole difficulty\nexisting, then, is to establish a direct proportion between\n“concentralization” and the _force_ of concentralization; and this is\r\ndone, of course, if we establish such proportion between “irradiation”\nand the _force_ of irradiation.\n\nA very slight inspection of the Heavens assures us that the stars have a\ncertain general uniformity, equability, or equidistance, of distribution\nthrough that region of space in which, collectively, and in a roughly\nglobular form, they are situated:—this species of very general, rather\nthan absolute, equability, being in full keeping with my deduction of\ninequidistance, within certain limits, among the originally diffused\r\natoms, as a corollary from the evident design of infinite complexity of\nrelation out of irrelation. I started, it will be remembered, with the\nidea of a generally uniform but particularly _un_uniform distribution of\nthe atoms;—an idea, I repeat, which an inspection of the stars, as they\nexist, confirms.\n\nBut even in the merely general equability of distribution, as regards\nthe atoms, there appears a difficulty which, no doubt, has already\nsuggested itself to those among my readers who have borne in mind that I\r\nsuppose this equability of distribution effected through _irradiation\nfrom a centre_. The very first glance at the idea, irradiation, forces\nus to the entertainment of the hitherto unseparated and seemingly\ninseparable idea of agglomeration about a centre, with dispersion as we\nrecede from it—the idea, in a word, of _in_equability of distribution in\nrespect to the matter irradiated.\n\nNow, I have elsewhere[1] observed that it is by just such difficulties\nas the one now in question—such roughnesses—such peculiarities—such","protuberances above the plane of the ordinary—that Reason feels her way,\nif at all, in her search for the True. By the difficulty—the\n“peculiarity”—now presented, I leap at once to _the_ secret—a secret\nwhich I might never have attained _but_ for the peculiarity and the\ninferences which, _in its mere character of peculiarity_, it affords me.\n\n    [1] “_Murders in the Rue Morgue_”—p. 133.\n\nThe process of thought, at this point, may be thus roughly sketched:—I\nsay to myself—“Unity, as I have explained it, is a truth—I feel it.\r\nDiffusion is a truth—I see it. Irradiation, by which alone these two\ntruths are reconciled, is a consequent truth—I perceive it. _Equability_\nof diffusion, first deduced _à priori_ and then corroborated by the\ninspection of phænomena, is also a truth—I fully admit it. So far all is\nclear around me:—there are no clouds behind which _the_ secret—the great\nsecret of the gravitating _modus operandi_—can possibly lie hidden;—but\nthis secret lies _hereabouts_, most assuredly; and _were_ there but a\r\ncloud in view, I should be driven to suspicion of that cloud.” And now,\njust as I say this, there actually comes a cloud into view. This cloud\nis the seeming impossibility of reconciling my truth, _irradiation_,\nwith my truth, _equability of diffusion_. I say now:—“Behind this\n_seeming_ impossibility is to be found what I desire.” I do not say\n“_real_ impossibility;” for invincible faith in my truths assures me\nthat it is a mere difficulty after all—but I go on to say, with\nunflinching confidence, that, _when_ this _difficulty_ shall be solved,\r\nwe shall find, _wrapped up in the process of solution_, the key to the\nsecret at which we aim. Moreover—I _feel_ that we shall discover _but\none_ possible solution of the difficulty; this for the reason that, were\nthere two, one would be supererogatory—would be fruitless—would be\nempty—would contain no key—since no duplicate key can be needed to any\nsecret of Nature.\n\nAnd now, let us see:—Our usual notions of irradiation—in fact _all_ our\ndistinct notions of it—are caught merely from the process as we see it","exemplified in _Light_. Here there is a _continuous_ outpouring of\n_ray-streams_, and _with a force which we have at least no right to\nsuppose varies at all_. Now, in any such irradiation _as\nthis_—continuous and of unvarying force—the regions nearer the centre\nmust _inevitably_ be always more crowded with the irradiated matter than\nthe regions more remote. But I have assumed _no_ such irradiation _as\nthis_. I assumed no _continuous_ irradiation; and for the simple reason\nthat such an assumption would have involved, first, the necessity of\r\nentertaining a conception which I have shown no man _can_ entertain, and\nwhich (as I will more fully explain hereafter) all observation of the\nfirmament refutes—the conception of the absolute infinity of the\nUniverse of stars—and would have involved, secondly, the impossibility\nof understanding a rëaction—that is, gravitation—as existing now—since,\nwhile an act is continued, no rëaction, of course, can take place. My\nassumption, then, or rather my inevitable deduction from just\r\npremises—was that of a _determinate_ irradiation—one finally\n_dis_continued.\n\nLet me now describe the sole possible mode in which it is conceivable\nthat matter could have been diffused through space, so as to fulfil the\nconditions at once of irradiation and of generally equable distribution.\n\nFor convenience of illustration, let us imagine, in the first place, a\nhollow sphere of glass, or of anything else, occupying the space\nthroughout which the universal matter is to be thus equally diffused, by\nmeans of irradiation, from the absolute, irrelative, unconditional\r\nparticle, placed in the centre of the sphere.\n\nNow, a certain exertion of the diffusive power (presumed to be the\nDivine Volition)—in other words, a certain _force_—whose measure is the\nquantity of matter—that is to say, the number of atoms—emitted; emits,\nby irradiation, this certain number of atoms; forcing them in all\ndirections outwardly from the centre—their proximity to each other\ndiminishing as they proceed—until, finally, they are distributed,\nloosely, over the interior surface of the sphere.","When these atoms have attained this position, or while proceeding to\nattain it, a second and inferior exercise of the same force—or a second\nand inferior force of the same character—emits, in the same manner—that\nis to say, by irradiation as before—a second stratum of atoms which\nproceeds to deposit itself upon the first; the number of atoms, in this\ncase as in the former, being of course the measure of the force which\nemitted them; in other words the force being precisely adapted to the\r\npurpose it effects—the force and the number of atoms sent out by the\nforce, being _directly proportional_.\n\nWhen this second stratum has reached its destined position—or while\napproaching it—a third still inferior exertion of the force, or a third\ninferior force of a similar character—the number of atoms emitted being\nin _all_ cases the measure of the force—proceeds to deposit a third\nstratum upon the second:—and so on, until these concentric strata,\ngrowing gradually less and less, come down at length to the central\r\npoint; and the diffusive matter, simultaneously with the diffusive\nforce, is exhausted.\n\nWe have now the sphere filled, through means of irradiation, with atoms\nequably diffused. The two necessary conditions—those of irradiation and\nof equable diffusion—are satisfied; and by the _sole_ process in which\nthe possibility of their simultaneous satisfaction is conceivable. For\nthis reason, I confidently expect to find, lurking in the present\ncondition of the atoms as distributed throughout the sphere, the secret\r\nof which I am in search—the all-important principle of the _modus\noperandi_ of the Newtonian law. Let us examine, then, the actual\ncondition of the atoms.\n\nThey lie in a series of concentric strata. They are equably diffused\nthroughout the sphere. They have been irradiated into these states.\n\nThe atoms being _equably_ distributed, the greater the superficial\nextent of any of these concentric strata, or spheres, the more atoms\nwill lie upon it. In other words, the number of atoms lying upon the\nsurface of any one of the concentric spheres, is directly proportional","with the extent of that surface.\n\n_But, in any series of concentric spheres, the surfaces are directly\nproportional with the squares of the distances from the centre._[2]\n\n    [2] Succinctly—The surfaces of spheres are as the squares of\n    their radii.\n\nTherefore the number of atoms in any stratum is directly proportional\nwith the square of that stratum’s distance from the centre.\n\nBut the number of atoms in any stratum is the measure of the force which\nemitted that stratum—that is to say, is _directly proportional_ with the\nforce.\r\nTherefore the force which irradiated any stratum is directly\nproportional with the square of that stratum’s distance from the\ncentre:—or, generally,\n\n_The force of the irradiation has been directly proportional with the\nsquares of the distances._\n\nNow, Rëaction, as far as we know anything of it, is Action conversed.\nThe _general_ principle of Gravity being, in the first place, understood\nas the rëaction of an act—as the expression of a desire on the part of\nMatter, while existing in a state of diffusion, to return into the Unity\r\nwhence it was diffused; and, in the second place, the mind being called\nupon to determine the _character_ of the desire—the manner in which it\nwould, naturally, be manifested; in other words, being called upon to\nconceive a probable law, or _modus operandi_, for the return; could not\nwell help arriving at the conclusion that this law of return would be\nprecisely the converse of the law of departure. That such would be the\ncase, any one, at least, would be abundantly justified in taking for\r\ngranted, until such time as some person should suggest something like a\nplausible reason why it should _not_ be the case—until such period as a\nlaw of return shall be imagined which the intellect can consider as\npreferable.\n\nMatter, then, irradiated into space with a force varying as the squares\nof the distances, might, _à priori_, be supposed to return towards its\ncentre of irradiation with a force varying _inversely_ as the squares of\nthe distances: and I have already shown[3] that any principle which will","explain why the atoms should tend, according to any law, to the general\ncentre, must be admitted as satisfactorily explaining, at the same time,\nwhy, according to the same law, they should tend each to each. For, in\nfact, the tendency to the general centre is not to a centre as such, but\nbecause of its being a point in tending towards which each atom tends\nmost directly to its real and essential centre, _Unity_—the absolute\nand final Union of all.\n\n    [3] Page 44.\n\nThe consideration here involved presents to my own mind no embarrassment\r\nwhatever—but this fact does not blind me to the possibility of its being\nobscure to those who may have been less in the habit of dealing with\nabstractions:—and, upon the whole, it may be as well to look at the\nmatter from one or two other points of view.\n\nThe absolute, irrelative particle primarily created by the Volition of\nGod, must have been in a condition of positive _normality_, or\nrightfulness—for wrongfulness implies _relation_. Right is positive;\nwrong is negative—is merely the negation of right; as cold is the\r\nnegation of heat—darkness of light. That a thing may be wrong, it is\nnecessary that there be some other thing in _relation_ to which it _is_\nwrong—some condition which it fails to satisfy; some law which it\nviolates; some being whom it aggrieves. If there be no such being, law,\nor condition, in respect to which the thing is wrong—and, still more\nespecially, if no beings, laws, or conditions exist at all—then the\nthing can_not_ be wrong and consequently must be _right_. Any deviation\nfrom normality involves a tendency to return into it. A difference from\r\nthe normal—from the right—from the just—can be understood as effected\nonly by the overcoming a difficulty; and if the force which overcomes\nthe difficulty be not infinitely continued, the ineradicable tendency to\nreturn will at length be permitted to act for its own satisfaction. Upon\nwithdrawal of the force, the tendency acts. This is the principle of\nrëaction as the inevitable consequence of finite action. Employing a\nphraseology of which the seeming affectation will be pardoned for its","expressiveness, we may say that Rëaction is the return from the\ncondition of _as it is and ought not to be_ into the condition of _as it\nwas, originally, and therefore ought to be_:—and let me add here that\nthe _absolute_ force of Rëaction would no doubt be always found in\ndirect proportion with the reality—the truth—the absoluteness—of the\n_originality_—if ever it were possible to measure this latter:—and,\nconsequently, the greatest of all conceivable reactions must be that\nproduced by the tendency which we now discuss—the tendency to return\r\ninto the _absolutely original_—into the _supremely_ primitive. Gravity,\nthen, _must be the strongest of forces_—an idea reached _à priori_ and\nabundantly confirmed by induction. What use I make of the idea, will be\nseen in the sequel.\n\nThe atoms, now, having been diffused from their normal condition of\nUnity, seek to return to——what? Not to any particular _point_,\ncertainly; for it is clear that if, upon the diffusion, the whole\nUniverse of matter had been projected, collectively, to a distance from\r\nthe point of irradiation, the atomic tendency to the general centre of\nthe sphere would not have been disturbed in the least:—the atoms would\nnot have sought the point _in absolute space_ from which they were\noriginally impelled. It is merely the _condition_, and not the point or\nlocality at which this condition took its rise, that these atoms seek to\nre-establish;—it is merely _that condition which is their normality_,\nthat they desire. “But they seek a centre,” it will be said, “and a\ncentre is a point.” True; but they seek this point not in its character\r\nof point—(for, were the whole sphere moved from its position, they would\nseek, equally, the centre; and the centre _then_ would be a _new_\npoint)—but because it so happens, on account of the form in which they\ncollectively exist—(that of the sphere)—that only _through_ the point in\nquestion—the sphere’s centre—they can attain their true object, Unity.\nIn the direction of the centre each atom perceives more atoms than in\nany other direction. Each atom is impelled towards the centre because","along the straight line joining it and the centre and passing on to the\ncircumference beyond, there lie a greater number of atoms than along any\nother straight line—a greater number of objects that seek it, the\nindividual atom—a greater number of tendencies to Unity—a greater number\nof satisfactions for its own tendency to Unity—in a word, because in the\ndirection of the centre lies the utmost possibility of satisfaction,\ngenerally, for its own individual appetite. To be brief, the\r\n_condition_, Unity, is all that is really sought; and if the atoms\n_seem_ to seek the centre of the sphere, it is only impliedly, through\nimplication—because such centre happens to imply, to include, or to\ninvolve, the only essential centre, Unity. But _on account of_ this\nimplication or involution, there is no possibility of practically\nseparating the tendency to Unity in the abstract, from the tendency to\nthe concrete centre. Thus the tendency of the atoms to the general\ncentre _is_, to all practical intents and for all logical purposes, the\r\ntendency each to each; and the tendency each to each _is_ the tendency\nto the centre; and the one tendency may be assumed _as_ the other;\nwhatever will apply to the one must be thoroughly applicable to the\nother; and, in conclusion, whatever principle will satisfactorily\nexplain the one, cannot be questioned as an explanation of the other.\n\nIn looking carefully around me for rational objection to what I have\nadvanced, I am able to discover _nothing_;—but of that class of\nobjections usually urged by the doubters for Doubt’s sake, I very\r\nreadily perceive _three_; and proceed to dispose of them in order.\n\nIt may be said, first: “The proof that the force of irradiation (in the\ncase described) is directly proportional to the squares of the\ndistances, depends upon an unwarranted assumption—that of the number of\natoms in each stratum being the measure of the force with which they are\nemitted.”\n\nI reply, not only that I am warranted in such assumption, but that I\nshould be utterly _un_warranted in any other. What I assume is, simply,","that an effect is the measure of its cause—that every exercise of the\nDivine Will will be proportional to that which demands the exertion—that\nthe means of Omnipotence, or of Omniscience, will be exactly adapted to\nits purposes. Neither can a deficiency nor an excess of cause bring to\npass any effect. Had the force which irradiated any stratum to its\nposition, been either more or less than was needed for the purpose—that\nis to say, not _directly proportional_ to the purpose—then to its\r\nposition that stratum could not have been irradiated. Had the force\nwhich, with a view to general equability of distribution, emitted the\nproper number of atoms for each stratum, been not _directly\nproportional_ to the number, then the number would _not_ have been the\nnumber demanded for the equable distribution.\n\nThe second supposable objection is somewhat better entitled to an\nanswer.\n\nIt is an admitted principle in Dynamics that every body, on receiving an\nimpulse, or disposition to move, will move onward in a straight line, in\r\nthe direction imparted by the impelling force, until deflected, or\nstopped, by some other force. How then, it may be asked, is my first or\nexternal stratum of atoms to be understood as discontinuing their\nmovement at the circumference of the imaginary glass sphere, when no\nsecond force, of more than an imaginary character, appears, to account\nfor the discontinuance?\n\nI reply that the objection, in this case, actually does arise out of “an\nunwarranted assumption”—on the part of the objector—the assumption of a\r\nprinciple, in Dynamics, at an epoch when _no_ “principles,” in\n_anything_, exist:—I use the word “principle,” of course, in the\nobjector’s understanding of the word.\n\n“In the beginning” we can admit—indeed we can comprehend—but one _First\nCause_—the truly ultimate _Principle_—the Volition of God. The primary\n_act_—that of Irradiation from Unity—must have been independent of all\nthat which the world now calls “principle”—because all that we so\ndesignate is but a consequence of the rëaction of that primary act:—I","say “_primary_” act; for the creation of the absolute material particle\nis more properly to be regarded as a _conception_ than as an “_act_” in\nthe ordinary meaning of the term. Thus, we must regard the primary act\nas an act for the establishment of what we now call “principles.” But\nthis primary act itself is to be considered as _continuous Volition_.\nThe Thought of God is to be understood as originating the Diffusion—as\nproceeding with it—as regulating it—and, finally, as being withdrawn\r\nfrom it upon its completion. _Then_ commences Rëaction, and through\nRëaction, “Principle,” as we employ the word. It will be advisable,\nhowever, to limit the application of this word to the two _immediate_\nresults of the discontinuance of the Divine Volition—that is, to the two\nagents, _Attraction_ and _Repulsion_. Every other Natural agent depends,\neither more or less immediately, upon these two, and therefore would be\nmore conveniently designated as _sub_-principle.\n\nIt may be objected, thirdly, that, in general, the peculiar mode of\r\ndistribution which I have suggested for the atoms, is “an hypothesis and\nnothing more.”\n\nNow, I am aware that the word hypothesis is a ponderous sledge-hammer,\ngrasped immediately, if not lifted, by all very diminutive thinkers,\nupon the first appearance of any proposition wearing, in any particular,\nthe garb of _a theory_. But “hypothesis” cannot be wielded _here_ to any\ngood purpose, even by those who succeed in lifting it—little men or\ngreat.\n\nI maintain, first, that _only_ in the mode described is it conceivable\r\nthat Matter could have been diffused so as to fulfil at once the\nconditions of irradiation and of generally equable distribution. I\nmaintain, secondly, that these conditions themselves have been imposed\nupon me, as necessities, in a train of ratiocination _as rigorously\nlogical as that which establishes any demonstration in Euclid_; and I\nmaintain, thirdly, that even if the charge of “hypothesis” were as fully\nsustained as it is, in fact, unsustained and untenable, still the\nvalidity and indisputability of my result would not, even in the","slightest particular, be disturbed.\n\nTo explain:—The Newtonian Gravity—a law of Nature—a law whose existence\nas such no one out of Bedlam questions—a law whose admission as such\nenables us to account for nine-tenths of the Universal phænomena—a law\nwhich, merely because it does so enable us to account for these\nphænomena, we are perfectly willing, without reference to any other\nconsiderations, to admit, and cannot help admitting, as a law—a law,\nnevertheless, of which neither the principle nor the _modus operandi_ of\r\nthe principle, has ever yet been traced by the human analysis—a law, in\nshort, which, neither in its detail nor in its generality, has been\nfound susceptible of explanation _at all_—is at length seen to be at\nevery point thoroughly explicable, provided only we yield our assent\nto——what? To an hypothesis? Why _if_ an hypothesis—if the merest\nhypothesis—if an hypothesis for whose assumption—as in the case of that\n_pure_ hypothesis the Newtonian law itself—no shadow of _à priori_\nreason could be assigned—if an hypothesis, even so absolute as all this\r\nimplies, would enable us to perceive a principle for the Newtonian\nlaw—would enable us to understand as satisfied, conditions so\nmiraculously—so ineffably complex and seemingly irreconcileable as those\ninvolved in the relations of which Gravity tells us,—what rational being\n_could_ so expose his fatuity as to call even this absolute hypothesis\nan hypothesis any longer—unless, indeed, he were to persist in so\ncalling it, with the understanding that he did so, simply for the sake\nof consistency _in words_?\r\nBut what is the true state of our present case? What is _the fact_? Not\nonly that it is _not_ an hypothesis which we are required _to adopt_,\nin order to admit the principle at issue explained, but that it _is_ a\nlogical conclusion which we are requested _not_ to adopt if we can avoid\nit—which we are simply invited to _deny if we can_:—a conclusion of so\naccurate a logicality that to dispute it would be the effort—to doubt\nits validity beyond our power:—a conclusion from which we see no mode of","escape, turn as we will; a result which confronts us either at the end\nof an _in_ductive journey from the phænomena of the very Law discussed,\nor at the close of a _de_ductive career from the most rigorously simple\nof all conceivable assumptions—_the assumption, in a word, of Simplicity\nitself_.\n\nAnd if here, for the mere sake of cavilling, it be urged, that although\nmy starting-point is, as I assert, the assumption of absolute\nSimplicity, yet Simplicity, considered merely in itself, is no axiom;\r\nand that only deductions from axioms are indisputable—it is thus that I\nreply:—\n\nEvery other science than Logic is the science of certain concrete\nrelations. Arithmetic, for example, is the science of the relations of\nnumber—Geometry, of the relations of form—Mathematics in general, of the\nrelations of quantity in general—of whatever can be increased or\ndiminished. Logic, however, is the science of Relation in the\nabstract—of absolute Relation—of Relation considered solely in itself.\nAn axiom in any particular science other than Logic is, thus, merely a\r\nproposition announcing certain concrete relations which seem to be too\nobvious for dispute—as when we say, for instance, that the whole is\ngreater than its part:—and, thus again, the principle of the _Logical_\naxiom—in other words, of an axiom in the abstract—is, simply,\n_obviousness of relation_. Now, it is clear, not only that what is\nobvious to one mind may not be obvious to another, but that what is\nobvious to one mind at one epoch, may be anything but obvious, at\nanother epoch, to the same mind. It is clear, moreover, that what,\r\nto-day, is obvious even to the majority of mankind, or to the majority\nof the best intellects of mankind, may to-morrow be, to either majority,\nmore or less obvious, or in no respect obvious at all. It is seen, then,\nthat the _axiomatic principle_ itself is susceptible of variation, and\nof course that axioms are susceptible of similar change. Being mutable,\nthe “truths” which grow out of them are necessarily mutable too; or, in\nother words, are never to be positively depended upon as truths at","all—since Truth and Immutability are one.\n\nIt will now be readily understood that no axiomatic idea—no idea founded\nin the fluctuating principle, obviousness of relation—can possibly be so\nsecure—so reliable a basis for any structure erected by the Reason, as\n_that_ idea—(whatever it is, wherever we can find it, or _if_ it be\npracticable to find it anywhere)—which is _ir_relative altogether—which\nnot only presents to the understanding _no obviousness_ of relation,\neither greater or less, to be considered, but subjects the intellect,\r\nnot in the slightest degree, to the necessity of even looking at _any\nrelation at all_. If such an idea be not what we too heedlessly term “an\naxiom,” it is at least preferable, as a Logical basis, to any axiom ever\npropounded, or to all imaginable axioms combined:—and such, precisely,\nis the idea with which my deductive process, so thoroughly corroborated\nby induction, commences. My _particle proper_ is but _absolute\nIrrelation_. To sum up what has been here advanced:—As a starting point\r\nI have taken it for granted, simply, that the Beginning had nothing\nbehind it or before it—that it was a Beginning in fact—that it was a\nbeginning and nothing different from a beginning—in short that this\nBeginning was——_that which it was_. If this be a “mere assumption” then\na “mere assumption” let it be.\n\nTo conclude this branch of the subject:—I am fully warranted in\nannouncing that _the Law which we have been in the habit of calling\nGravity exists on account of Matter’s having been irradiated, at its\norigin, atomically, into a limited[4] sphere of Space, from one,\r\nindividual, unconditional, irrelative, and absolute Particle Proper, by\nthe sole process in which it was possible to satisfy, at the same time,\nthe two conditions, irradiation, and generally-equable distribution\nthroughout the sphere—that is to say, by a force varying in direct\nproportion with the squares of the distances between the irradiated\natoms, respectively, and the Particular centre of Irradiation_.\n\n    [4] Limited sphere—A sphere is _necessarily_ limited. I prefer\n    tautology to a chance of misconception.","I have already given my reasons for presuming Matter to have been\ndiffused by a determinate rather than by a continuous or infinitely\ncontinued force. Supposing a continuous force, we should be unable, in\nthe first place, to comprehend a rëaction at all; and we should be\nrequired, in the second place, to entertain the impossible conception of\nan infinite extension of Matter. Not to dwell upon the impossibility of\nthe conception, the infinite extension of Matter is an idea which, if\r\nnot positively disproved, is at least not in any respect warranted by\ntelescopic observation of the stars—a point to be explained more fully\nhereafter; and this empirical reason for believing in the original\nfinity of Matter is unempirically confirmed. For example:—Admitting, for\nthe moment, the possibility of understanding Space _filled_ with the\nirradiated atoms—that is to say, admitting, as well as we can, for\nargument’s sake, that the succession of the irradiated atoms had\nabsolutely _no end_—then it is abundantly clear that, even when the\r\nVolition of God had been withdrawn from them, and thus the tendency to\nreturn into Unity permitted (abstractly) to be satisfied, this\npermission would have been nugatory and invalid—practically valueless\nand of no effect whatever. No Rëaction could have taken place; no\nmovement toward Unity could have been made; no Law of Gravity could have\nobtained.\n\nTo explain:—Grant the _abstract_ tendency of any one atom to any one\nother as the inevitable result of diffusion from the normal Unity:—or,\r\nwhat is the same thing, admit any given atom as _proposing_ to move in\nany given direction—it is clear that, since there is an _infinity_ of\natoms on all sides of the atom proposing to move, it never can actually\nmove toward the satisfaction of its tendency in the direction given, on\naccount of a precisely equal and counterbalancing tendency in the\ndirection diametrically opposite. In other words, exactly as many\ntendencies to Unity are behind the hesitating atom as before it; for it\nis a mere sotticism to say that one infinite line is longer or shorter","than another infinite line, or that one infinite number is greater or\nless than another number that is infinite. Thus the atom in question\nmust remain stationary forever. Under the impossible circumstances which\nwe have been merely endeavoring to conceive for argument’s sake, there\ncould have been no aggregation of Matter—no stars—no worlds—nothing but\na perpetually atomic and inconsequential Universe. In fact, view it as\nwe will, the whole idea of unlimited Matter is not only untenable, but\nimpossible and preposterous.\r\nWith the understanding of a _sphere_ of atoms, however, we perceive, at\nonce, a _satisfiable_ tendency to union. The general result of the\ntendency each to each, being a tendency of all to the centre, the\n_general_ process of condensation, or approximation, commences\nimmediately, by a common and simultaneous movement, on withdrawal of the\nDivine Volition; the _individual_ approximations, or coalescences—_not_\ncöalitions—of atom with atom, being subject to almost infinite\nvariations of time, degree, and condition, on account of the excessive\r\nmultiplicity of relation, arising from the differences of form assumed\nas characterizing the atoms at the moment of their quitting the Particle\nProper; as well as from the subsequent particular inequidistance, each\nfrom each.\n\nWhat I wish to impress upon the reader is the certainty of there\narising, at once, (on withdrawal of the diffusive force, or Divine\nVolition,) out of the condition of the atoms as described, at\ninnumerable points throughout the Universal sphere, innumerable\r\nagglomerations, characterized by innumerable specific differences of\nform, size, essential nature, and distance each from each. The\ndevelopment of Repulsion (Electricity) must have commenced, of course,\nwith the very earliest particular efforts at Unity, and must have\nproceeded constantly in the ratio of Coalescence—that is to say, _in\nthat of Condensation_, or, again, of Heterogeneity.\n\nThus the two Principles Proper, _Attraction_ and _Repulsion_—the\nMaterial and the Spiritual—accompany each other, in the strictest","fellowship, forever. Thus _The Body and The Soul walk hand in hand_.\n\nIf now, in fancy, we select _any one_ of the agglomerations considered\nas in their primary stages throughout the Universal sphere, and suppose\nthis incipient agglomeration to be taking place at that point where the\ncentre of our Sun exists—or rather where it _did_ exist originally; for\nthe Sun is perpetually shifting his position—we shall find ourselves\nmet, and borne onward for a time at least, by the most magnificent of\ntheories—by the Nebular Cosmogony of Laplace:—although “Cosmogony” is\r\nfar too comprehensive a term for what he really discusses—which is the\nconstitution of our solar system alone—of one among the myriad of\nsimilar systems which make up the Universe Proper—that Universal\nsphere—that all-inclusive and absolute _Kosmos_ which forms the subject\nof my present Discourse.\n\nConfining himself to an _obviously limited_ region—that of our solar\nsystem with its comparatively immediate vicinity—and _merely_\nassuming—that is to say, assuming without any basis whatever, either\r\ndeductive or inductive—_much_ of what I have been just endeavoring to\nplace upon a more stable basis than assumption; assuming, for example,\nmatter as diffused (without pretending to account for the diffusion)\nthroughout, and somewhat beyond, the space occupied by our\nsystem—diffused in a state of heterogeneous nebulosity and obedient to\nthat omniprevalent law of Gravity at whose principle he ventured to make\nno guess;—assuming all this (which is quite true, although he had no\r\nlogical right to its assumption) Laplace has shown, dynamically and\nmathematically, that the results in such case necessarily ensuing, are\nthose and those alone which we find manifested in the actually existing\ncondition of the system itself.\n\nTo explain:—Let us conceive _that_ particular agglomeration of which we\nhave just spoken—the one at the point designated by our Sun’s centre—to\nhave so far proceeded that a vast quantity of nebulous matter has here\nassumed a roughly globular form; its centre being, of course, coincident","with what is now, or rather was originally, the centre of our Sun; and\nits periphery extending out beyond the orbit of Neptune, the most remote\nof our planets:—in other words, let us suppose the diameter of this\nrough sphere to be some 6000 millions of miles. For ages, this mass of\nmatter has been undergoing condensation, until at length it has become\nreduced into the bulk we imagine; having proceeded gradually, of course,\nfrom its atomic and imperceptible state, into what we understand of\nvisible, palpable, or otherwise appreciable nebulosity.\r\nNow, the condition of this mass implies a rotation about an imaginary\naxis—a rotation which, commencing with the absolute incipiency of the\naggregation, has been ever since acquiring velocity. The very first two\natoms which met, approaching each other from points not diametrically\nopposite, would, in rushing partially past each other, form a nucleus\nfor the rotary movement described. How this would increase in velocity,\nis readily seen. The two atoms are joined by others:—an aggregation is\r\nformed. The mass continues to rotate while condensing. But any atom at\nthe circumference has, of course, a more rapid motion than one nearer\nthe centre. The outer atom, however, with its superior velocity,\napproaches the centre; carrying this superior velocity with it as it\ngoes. Thus every atom, proceeding inwardly, and finally attaching itself\nto the condensed centre, adds something to the original velocity of that\ncentre—that is to say, increases the rotary movement of the mass.\r\nLet us now suppose this mass so far condensed that it occupies\n_precisely_ the space circumscribed by the orbit of Neptune, and that\nthe velocity with which the surface of the mass moves, in the general\nrotation, is precisely that velocity with which Neptune now revolves\nabout the Sun. At this epoch, then, we are to understand that the\nconstantly increasing centrifugal force, having gotten the better of the\nnon-increasing centripetal, loosened and separated the exterior and\nleast condensed stratum, or a few of the exterior and least condensed","strata, at the equator of the sphere, where the tangential velocity\npredominated; so that these strata formed about the main body an\nindependent ring encircling the equatorial regions:—just as the exterior\nportion thrown off, by excessive velocity of rotation, from a\ngrindstone, would form a ring about the grindstone, but for the solidity\nof the superficial material: were this caoutchouc, or anything similar\nin consistency, precisely the phænomenon I describe would be presented.\n\nThe ring thus whirled from the nebulous mass, _revolved_, of course,\r\n_as_ a separate ring, with just that velocity with which, while the\nsurface of the mass, it _rotated_. In the meantime, condensation still\nproceeding, the interval between the discharged ring and the main body\ncontinued to increase, until the former was left at a vast distance from\nthe latter.\n\nNow, admitting the ring to have possessed, by some seemingly accidental\narrangement of its heterogeneous materials, a constitution nearly\nuniform, then this ring, _as_ such, would never have ceased revolving\r\nabout its primary; but, as might have been anticipated, there appears to\nhave been enough irregularity in the disposition of the materials, to\nmake them cluster about centres of superior solidity; and thus the\nannular form was destroyed.[5] No doubt, the band was soon broken up\ninto several portions, and one of these portions, predominating in mass,\nabsorbed the others into itself; the whole settling, spherically, into a\nplanet. That this latter, _as_ a planet, continued the revolutionary\r\nmovement which characterized it while a ring, is sufficiently clear; and\nthat it took upon itself also, an additional movement in its new\ncondition of sphere, is readily explained. The ring being understood as\nyet unbroken, we see that its exterior, while the whole revolves about\nthe parent body, moves more rapidly than its interior. When the rupture\noccurred, then, some portion in each fragment must have been moving\nwith greater velocity than the others. The superior movement prevailing,\nmust have whirled each fragment round—that is to say, have caused it to","rotate; and the direction of the rotation must, of course, have been the\ndirection of the revolution whence it arose. _All_ the fragments having\nbecome subject to the rotation described, must, in coalescing, have\nimparted it to the one planet constituted by their coalescence.—This\nplanet was Neptune. Its material continuing to undergo condensation, and\nthe centrifugal force generated in its rotation getting, at length, the\nbetter of the centripetal, as before in the case of the parent orb, a\r\nring was whirled also from the equatorial surface of this planet: this\nring, having been ununiform in its constitution, was broken up, and its\nseveral fragments, being absorbed by the most massive, were collectively\nspherified into a moon. Subsequently, the operation was repeated, and a\nsecond moon was the result. We thus account for the planet Neptune, with\nthe two satellites which accompany him.\n\n    [5] Laplace assumed his nebulosity heterogeneous, merely that\n    he might be thus enabled to account for the breaking up of the\r\nrings; for had the nebulosity been homogeneous, they would not\n    have broken. I reach the same result—heterogeneity of the\n    secondary masses immediately resulting from the atoms—purely\n    from an _à priori_ consideration of their general\n    design—_Relation_.\n\nIn throwing off a ring from its equator, the Sun re-established that\nequilibrium between its centripetal and centrifugal forces which had\nbeen disturbed in the process of condensation; but, as this condensation\nstill proceeded, the equilibrium was again immediately disturbed,\r\nthrough the increase of rotation. By the time the mass had so far shrunk\nthat it occupied a spherical space just that circumscribed by the orbit\nof Uranus, we are to understand that the centrifugal force had so far\nobtained the ascendency that new relief was needed: a second equatorial\nband was, consequently, thrown off, which, proving ununiform, was\nbroken up, as before in the case of Neptune; the fragments settling into\nthe planet Uranus; the velocity of whose actual revolution about the Sun","indicates, of course, the rotary speed of that Sun’s equatorial surface\nat the moment of the separation. Uranus, adopting a rotation from the\ncollective rotations of the fragments composing it, as previously\nexplained, now threw off ring after ring; each of which, becoming broken\nup, settled into a moon:—three moons, at different epochs, having been\nformed, in this manner, by the rupture and general spherification of as\nmany distinct ununiform rings.\n\nBy the time the Sun had shrunk until it occupied a space just that\r\ncircumscribed by the orbit of Saturn, the balance, we are to suppose,\nbetween its centripetal and centrifugal forces had again become so far\ndisturbed, through increase of rotary velocity, the result of\ncondensation, that a third effort at equilibrium became necessary; and\nan annular band was therefore whirled off as twice before; which, on\nrupture through ununiformity, became consolidated into the planet\nSaturn. This latter threw off, in the first place, seven uniform bands,\r\nwhich, on rupture, were spherified respectively into as many moons; but,\nsubsequently, it appears to have discharged, at three distinct but not\nvery distant epochs, three rings whose equability of constitution was,\nby apparent accident, so considerable as to present no occasion for\ntheir rupture; thus they continue to revolve as rings. I use the phrase\n“_apparent_ accident;” for of accident in the ordinary sense there was,\nof course, nothing:—the term is properly applied only to the result of\r\nindistinguishable or not immediately traceable _law_.\n\nShrinking still farther, until it occupied just the space circumscribed\nby the orbit of Jupiter, the Sun now found need of farther effort to\nrestore the counterbalance of its two forces, continually disarranged in\nthe still continued increase of rotation. Jupiter, accordingly, was now\nthrown off; passing from the annular to the planetary condition; and, on\nattaining this latter, threw off in its turn, at four different epochs,\nfour rings, which finally resolved themselves into so many moons.","Still shrinking, until its sphere occupied just the space defined by the\norbit of the Asteroids, the Sun now discarded a ring which appears to\nhave had _eight_ centres of superior solidity, and, on breaking up, to\nhave separated into eight fragments no one of which so far predominated\nin mass as to absorb the others. All therefore, as distinct although\ncomparatively small planets, proceeded to revolve in orbits whose\ndistances, each from each, may be considered as in some degree the\r\nmeasure of the force which drove them asunder:—all the orbits,\nnevertheless, being so closely coincident as to admit of our calling\nthem _one_, in view of the other planetary orbits.\n\nContinuing to shrink, the Sun, on becoming so small as just to fill the\norbit of Mars, now discharged this planet—of course by the process\nrepeatedly described. Having no moon, however, Mars could have thrown\noff no ring. In fact, an epoch had now arrived in the career of the\nparent body, the centre of the system. The _de_crease of its nebulosity,\r\nwhich is the _in_crease of its density, and which again is the\n_de_crease of its condensation, out of which latter arose the constant\ndisturbance of equilibrium—must, by this period, have attained a point\nat which the efforts for restoration would have been more and more\nineffectual just in proportion as they were less frequently needed. Thus\nthe processes of which we have been speaking would everywhere show signs\nof exhaustion—in the planets, first, and secondly, in the original mass.\nWe must not fall into the error of supposing the decrease of interval\r\nobserved among the planets as we approach the Sun, to be in any respect\nindicative of an increase of frequency in the periods at which they were\ndiscarded. Exactly the converse is to be understood. The longest\ninterval of time must have occurred between the discharges of the two\ninterior; the shortest, between those of the two exterior, planets. The\ndecrease of the interval of space is, nevertheless, the measure of the\ndensity, and thus inversely of the condensation, of the Sun, throughout\nthe processes detailed.","Having shrunk, however, so far as to fill only the orbit of our Earth,\nthe parent sphere whirled from itself still one other body—the Earth—in\na condition so nebulous as to admit of this body’s discarding, in its\nturn, yet another, which is our Moon;—but here terminated the lunar\nformations.\n\nFinally, subsiding to the orbits first of Venus and then of Mercury, the\nSun discarded these two interior planets; neither of which has given\nbirth to any moon.\n\nThus from his original bulk—or, to speak more accurately, from the\r\ncondition in which we first considered him—from a partially spherified\nnebular mass, _certainly_ much more than 5,600 millions of miles in\ndiameter—the great central orb and origin of our solar-planetary-lunar\nsystem, has gradually descended, by condensation, in obedience to the\nlaw of Gravity, to a globe only 882,000 miles in diameter; but it by no\nmeans follows, either that its condensation is yet complete, or that it\nmay not still possess the capacity of whirling from itself another\nplanet.\r\nI have here given—in outline of course, but still with all the detail\nnecessary for distinctness—a view of the Nebular Theory as its author\nhimself conceived it. From whatever point we regard it, we shall find it\n_beautifully true_. It is by far too beautiful, indeed, _not_ to possess\nTruth as its essentiality—and here I am very profoundly serious in what\nI say. In the revolution of the satellites of Uranus, there does appear\nsomething seemingly inconsistent with the assumptions of Laplace; but\r\nthat _one_ inconsistency can invalidate a theory constructed from a\nmillion of intricate consistencies, is a fancy fit only for the\nfantastic. In prophecying, confidently, that the apparent anomaly to\nwhich I refer, will, sooner or later, be found one of the strongest\npossible corroborations of the general hypothesis, I pretend to no\nespecial spirit of divination. It is a matter which the only difficulty\nseems _not_ to foresee.[6]\n\n    [6] I am prepared to show that the anomalous revolution of the\n    satellites of Uranus is a simply perspective anomaly arising","from the inclination of the axis of the planet.\n\nThe bodies whirled off in the processes described, would exchange, it\nhas been seen, the superficial _rotation_ of the orbs whence they\noriginated, for a _revolution_ of equal velocity about these orbs as\ndistant centres; and the revolution thus engendered must proceed, so\nlong as the centripetal force, or that with which the discarded body\ngravitates toward its parent, is neither greater nor less than that by\nwhich it was discarded; that is, than the centrifugal, or, far more\r\nproperly, than the tangential, velocity. From the unity, however, of the\norigin of these two forces, we might have expected to find them as they\nare found—the one accurately counterbalancing the other. It has been\nshown, indeed, that the act of whirling-off is, in every case, merely an\nact for the preservation of the counterbalance.\n\nAfter referring, however, the centripetal force to the omniprevalent law\nof Gravity, it has been the fashion with astronomical treatises, to seek\nbeyond the limits of mere Nature—that is to say, of _Secondary_ Cause—a\r\nsolution of the phænomenon of tangential velocity. This latter they\nattribute directly to a _First_ Cause—to God. The force which carries a\nstellar body around its primary they assert to have originated in an\nimpulse given immediately by the finger—this is the childish phraseology\nemployed—by the finger of Deity itself. In this view, the planets, fully\nformed, are conceived to have been hurled from the Divine hand, to a\nposition in the vicinity of the suns, with an impetus mathematically\r\nadapted to the masses, or attractive capacities, of the suns themselves.\nAn idea so grossly unphilosophical, although so supinely adopted, could\nhave arisen only from the difficulty of otherwise accounting for the\nabsolutely accurate adaptation, each to each, of two forces so seemingly\nindependent, one of the other, as are the gravitating and tangential.\nBut it should be remembered that, for a long time, the coincidence\nbetween the moon’s rotation and her sidereal revolution—two matters\nseemingly far more independent than those now considered—was looked","upon as positively miraculous; and there was a strong disposition, even\namong astronomers, to attribute the marvel to the direct and continual\nagency of God—who, in this case, it was said, had found it necessary to\ninterpose, specially, among his general laws, a set of subsidiary\nregulations, for the purpose of forever concealing from mortal eyes the\nglories, or perhaps the horrors, of the other side of the Moon—of that\nmysterious hemisphere which has always avoided, and must perpetually\r\navoid, the telescopic scrutiny of mankind. The advance of Science,\nhowever, soon demonstrated—what to the philosophical instinct needed\n_no_ demonstration—that the one movement is but a portion—something\nmore, even, than a consequence—of the other.\n\nFor my part, I have no patience with fantasies at once so timorous, so\nidle, and so awkward. They belong to the veriest _cowardice_ of thought.\nThat Nature and the God of Nature are distinct, no thinking being can\nlong doubt. By the former we imply merely the laws of the latter. But\r\nwith the very idea of God, omnipotent, omniscient, we entertain, also,\nthe idea of _the infallibility_ of his laws. With Him there being\nneither Past nor Future—with Him all being _Now_—do we not insult him in\nsupposing his laws so contrived as not to provide for every possible\ncontingency?—or, rather, what idea _can_ we have of _any_ possible\ncontingency, except that it is at once a result and a manifestation of\nhis laws? He who, divesting himself of prejudice, shall have the rare\ncourage to think absolutely for himself, cannot fail to arrive, in the\r\nend, at the condensation of _laws_ into _Law_—cannot fail of reaching\nthe conclusion that _each law of Nature is dependent at all points upon\nall other laws_, and that all are but consequences of one primary\nexercise of the Divine Volition. Such is the principle of the Cosmogony\nwhich, with all necessary deference, I here venture to suggest and to\nmaintain.\n\nIn this view, it will be seen that, dismissing as frivolous, and even\nimpious, the fancy of the tangential force having been imparted to the","planets immediately by “the finger of God,” I consider this force as\noriginating in the rotation of the stars:—this rotation as brought about\nby the in-rushing of the primary atoms, towards their respective centres\nof aggregation:—this in-rushing as the consequence of the law of\nGravity:—this law as but the mode in which is necessarily manifested the\ntendency of the atoms to return into imparticularity:—this tendency to\nreturn as but the inevitable rëaction of the first and most sublime of\r\nActs—that act by which a God, self-existing and alone existing, became\nall things at once, through dint of his volition, while all things were\nthus constituted a portion of God.\n\nThe radical assumptions of this Discourse suggest to me, and in fact\nimply, certain important _modifications_ of the Nebular Theory as given\nby Laplace. The efforts of the repulsive power I have considered as made\nfor the purpose of preventing contact among the atoms, and thus as made\nin the ratio of the approach to contact—that is to say, in the ratio of\r\ncondensation.[7] In other words, _Electricity_, with its involute\nphænomena, heat, light and magnetism, is to be understood as proceeding\nas condensation proceeds, and, of course, inversely as density proceeds,\nor the _cessation to condense_. Thus the Sun, in the process of its\naggregation, must soon, in developing repulsion, have become excessively\nheated—perhaps incandescent: and we can perceive how the operation of\ndiscarding its rings must have been materially assisted by the slight\r\nincrustation of its surface consequent on cooling. Any common experiment\nshows us how readily a crust of the character suggested, is separated,\nthrough heterogeneity, from the interior mass. But, on every successive\nrejection of the crust, the new surface would appear incandescent as\nbefore; and the period at which it would again become so far encrusted\nas to be readily loosened and discharged, may well be imagined as\nexactly coincident with that at which a new effort would be needed, by\nthe whole mass, to restore the equilibrium of its two forces,","disarranged through condensation. In other words:—by the time the\nelectric influence (Repulsion) has prepared the surface for rejection,\nwe are to understand that the gravitating influence (Attraction) is\nprecisely ready to reject it. Here, then, as everywhere, _the Body and\nthe Soul walk hand in hand_.\n\n    [7] See page 70.\n\nThese ideas are empirically confirmed at all points. Since condensation\ncan never, in any body, be considered as absolutely at an end, we are\nwarranted in anticipating that, whenever we have an opportunity of\r\ntesting the matter, we shall find indications of resident luminosity in\n_all_ the stellar bodies—moons and planets as well as suns. That our\nMoon is strongly self-luminous, we see at her every total eclipse, when,\nif not so, she would disappear. On the dark part of the satellite, too,\nduring her phases, we often observe flashes like our own Auroras; and\nthat these latter, with our various other so-called electrical\nphænomena, without reference to any more steady radiance, must give our\r\nEarth a certain appearance of luminosity to an inhabitant of the Moon,\nis quite evident. In fact, we should regard all the phænomena referred\nto, as mere manifestations, in different moods and degrees, of the\nEarth’s feebly-continued condensation.\n\nIf my views are tenable, we should be prepared to find the newer\nplanets—that is to say, those nearer the Sun—more luminous than those\nolder and more remote:—and the extreme brilliancy of Venus (on whose\ndark portions, during her phases, the Auroras are frequently visible)\r\ndoes not seem to be altogether accounted for by her mere proximity to\nthe central orb. She is no doubt vividly self-luminous, although less so\nthan Mercury: while the luminosity of Neptune may be comparatively\nnothing.\n\nAdmitting what I have urged, it is clear that, from the moment of the\nSun’s discarding a ring, there must be a continuous diminution both of\nhis heat and light, on account of the continuous encrustation of his\nsurface; and that a period would arrive—the period immediately previous\nto a new discharge—when a _very material_ decrease of both light and","heat, must become apparent. Now, we know that tokens of such changes are\ndistinctly recognizable. On the Melville islands—to adduce merely one\nout of a hundred examples—we find traces of _ultra-tropical_\nvegetation—of plants that never could have flourished without immensely\nmore light and heat than are at present afforded by our Sun to any\nportion of the surface of the Earth. Is such vegetation referable to an\nepoch immediately subsequent to the whirling-off of Venus? At this epoch\r\nmust have occurred to us our greatest access of solar influence; and,\nin fact, this influence must then have attained its maximum:—leaving out\nof view, of course, the period when the Earth itself was discarded—the\nperiod of its mere organization.\n\nAgain:—we know that there exist _non-luminous suns_—that is to say, suns\nwhose existence we determine through the movements of others, but whose\nluminosity is not sufficient to impress us. Are these suns invisible\nmerely on account of the length of time elapsed since their discharge of\r\na planet? And yet again:—may we not—at least in certain cases—account\nfor the sudden appearances of suns where none had been previously\nsuspected, by the hypothesis that, having rolled with encrusted surfaces\nthroughout the few thousand years of our astronomical history, each of\nthese suns, in whirling off a new secondary, has at length been enabled\nto display the glories of its still incandescent interior?—To the\nwell-ascertained fact of the proportional increase of heat as we descend\ninto the Earth, I need of course, do nothing more than refer:—it comes\r\nin the strongest possible corroboration of all that I have said on the\ntopic now at issue.\n\nIn speaking, not long ago, of the repulsive or electrical influence, I\nremarked that “the important phænomena of vitality, consciousness, and\nthought, whether we observe them generally or in detail, seem to proceed\n_at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous_.”[8] I mentioned, too, that\nI would recur to the suggestion:—and this is the proper point at which\nto do so. Looking at the matter, first, in detail, we perceive that not","merely the _manifestation_ of vitality, but its importance, consequence,\nand elevation of character, keep pace, very closely, with the\nheterogeneity, or complexity, of the animal structure. Looking at the\nquestion, now, in its generality, and referring to the first movements\nof the atoms towards mass-constitution, we find that heterogeneousness,\nbrought about directly through condensation, is proportional with it\nforever. We thus reach the proposition that _the importance of the\r\ndevelopment of the terrestrial vitality proceeds equably with the\nterrestrial condensation_.\n\n    [8] Page 36.\n\nNow this is in precise accordance with what we know of the succession of\nanimals on the Earth. As it has proceeded in its condensation, superior\nand still superior races have appeared. Is it impossible that the\nsuccessive geological revolutions which have attended, at least, if not\nimmediately caused, these successive elevations of vitalic character—is\nit improbable that these revolutions have themselves been produced by\r\nthe successive planetary discharges from the Sun—in other words, by the\nsuccessive variations in the solar influence on the Earth? Were this\nidea tenable, we should not be unwarranted in the fancy that the\ndischarge of yet a new planet, interior to Mercury, may give rise to yet\na new modification of the terrestrial surface—a modification from which\nmay spring a race both materially and spiritually superior to Man. These\nthoughts impress me with all the force of truth—but I throw them out, of\r\ncourse, merely in their obvious character of suggestion.\n\nThe Nebular Theory of Laplace has lately received far more confirmation\nthan it needed, at the hands of the philosopher, Compte. These two have\nthus together shown—_not_, to be sure, that Matter at any period\nactually existed as described, in a state of nebular diffusion, but\nthat, admitting it so to have existed throughout the space and much\nbeyond the space now occupied by our solar system, _and to have\ncommenced a movement towards a centre_—it must gradually have assumed","the various forms and motions which are now seen, in that system, to\nobtain. A demonstration such as this—a dynamical and mathematical\ndemonstration, as far as demonstration can be—unquestionable and\nunquestioned—unless, indeed, by that unprofitable and disreputable\ntribe, the professional questioners—the mere madmen who deny the\nNewtonian law of Gravity on which the results of the French\nmathematicians are based—a demonstration, I say, such as this, would to\nmost intellects be conclusive—and I confess that it is so to mine—of the\r\nvalidity of the nebular hypothesis upon which the demonstration depends.\n\nThat the demonstration does not _prove_ the hypothesis, according to the\ncommon understanding of the word “proof,” I admit, of course. To show\nthat certain existing results—that certain established facts—may be,\neven mathematically, accounted for by the assumption of a certain\nhypothesis, is by no means to establish the hypothesis itself. In other\nwords:—to show that, certain data being given, a certain existing result\r\nmight, or even _must_, have ensued, will fail to prove that this result\n_did_ ensue, _from the data_, until such time as it shall be also shown\nthat there are, _and can be_, no other data from which the result in\nquestion might _equally_ have ensued. But, in the case now discussed,\nalthough all must admit the deficiency of what we are in the habit of\nterming “proof,” still there are many intellects, and those of the\nloftiest order, to which _no_ proof could bring one iota of additional\r\n_conviction_. Without going into details which might impinge upon the\nCloud-Land of Metaphysics, I may as well here observe that the force of\nconviction, in cases such as this, will always, with the right-thinking,\nbe proportional to the amount of _complexity_ intervening between the\nhypothesis and the result. To be less abstract:—The greatness of the\ncomplexity found existing among cosmical conditions, by rendering great\nin the same proportion the difficulty of accounting for all these\nconditions _at once_, strengthens, also in the same proportion, our","faith in that hypothesis which does, in such manner, satisfactorily\naccount for them:—and as _no_ complexity can well be conceived greater\nthan that of the astronomical conditions, so no conviction can be\nstronger—to _my_ mind at least—than that with which I am impressed by an\nhypothesis that not only reconciles these conditions, with mathematical\naccuracy, and reduces them into a consistent and intelligible whole, but\nis, at the same time, the _sole_ hypothesis by means of which the human\r\nintellect has been ever enabled to account for them _at all_.\n\nA most unfounded opinion has become latterly current in gossiping and\neven in scientific circles—the opinion that the so-called Nebular\nCosmogony has been overthrown. This fancy has arisen from the report of\nlate observations made, among what hitherto have been termed the\n“nebulæ,” through the large telescope of Cincinnati, and the\nworld-renowned instrument of Lord Rosse. Certain spots in the firmament\nwhich presented, even to the most powerful of the old telescopes, the\r\nappearance of nebulosity, or haze, had been regarded for a long time as\nconfirming the theory of Laplace. They were looked upon as stars in that\nvery process of condensation which I have been attempting to describe.\nThus it was supposed that we “had ocular evidence”—an evidence, by the\nway, which has always been found very questionable—of the truth of the\nhypothesis; and, although certain telescopic improvements, every now and\nthen, enabled us to perceive that a spot, here and there, which we had\r\nbeen classing among the nebulæ, was, in fact, but a cluster of stars\nderiving its nebular character only from its immensity of distance—still\nit was thought that no doubt could exist as to the actual nebulosity of\nnumerous other masses, the strong-holds of the nebulists, bidding\ndefiance to every effort at segregation. Of these latter the most\ninteresting was the great “nebulæ” in the constellation Orion:—but this,\nwith innumerable other mis-called “nebulæ,” when viewed through the\nmagnificent modern telescopes, has become resolved into a simple","collection of stars. Now this fact has been very generally understood as\nconclusive against the Nebular Hypothesis of Laplace; and, on\nannouncement of the discoveries in question, the most enthusiastic\ndefender and most eloquent popularizer of the theory, Dr. Nichol, went\nso far as to “admit the necessity of abandoning” an idea which had\nformed the material of his most praiseworthy book.[9]\n\n    [9] “_Views of the Architecture of the Heavens._” A letter,\n    purporting to be from Dr. Nichol to a friend in America, went\r\nthe rounds of our newspapers, about two years ago, I think,\n    admitting “the necessity” to which I refer. In a subsequent\n    Lecture, however, Dr. N. appears in some manner to have gotten\n    the better of the necessity, and does not quite _renounce_ the\n    theory, although he seems to wish that he could sneer at it as\n    “a purely hypothetical one.” What else was the Law of Gravity\n    before the Maskelyne experiments? and who questioned the Law of\n    Gravity, even then?\r\nMany of my readers will no doubt be inclined to say that the result of\nthese new investigations _has_ at least a strong _tendency_ to overthrow\nthe hypothesis; while some of them, more thoughtful, will suggest that,\nalthough the theory is by no means disproved through the segregation of\nthe particular “nebulæ,” alluded to, still a _failure_ to segregate\nthem, with such telescopes, might well have been understood as a\ntriumphant _corroboration_ of the theory:—and this latter class will be\nsurprised, perhaps, to hear me say that even with _them_ I disagree. If\r\nthe propositions of this Discourse have been comprehended, it will be\nseen that, in my view, a failure to segregate the “nebulæ” would have\ntended to the refutation, rather than to the confirmation, of the\nNebular Hypothesis.\n\nLet me explain:—The Newtonian Law of Gravity we may, of course, assume\nas demonstrated. This law, it will be remembered, I have referred to the\nrëaction of the first Divine Act—to the rëaction of an exercise of the\nDivine Volition temporarily overcoming a difficulty. This difficulty is","that of forcing the normal into the abnormal—of impelling that whose\noriginality, and therefore whose rightful condition, was _One_, to take\nupon itself the wrongful condition of _Many_. It is only by conceiving\nthis difficulty as _temporarily_ overcome, that we can comprehend a\nrëaction. There could have been no rëaction had the act been infinitely\ncontinued. So long as the act _lasted_, no rëaction, of course, could\ncommence; in other words, no _gravitation_ could take place—for we have\r\nconsidered the one as but the manifestation of the other. But\ngravitation _has_ taken place; therefore the act of Creation has ceased:\nand gravitation has long ago taken place; therefore the act of Creation\nhas long ago ceased. We can no more expect, then, to observe _the\nprimary processes_ of Creation; and to these primary processes the\ncondition of nebulosity has already been explained to belong.\n\nThrough what we know of the propagation of light, we have direct proof\nthat the more remote of the stars have existed, under the forms in which\r\nwe now see them, for an inconceivable number of years. So far back _at\nleast_, then, as the period when these stars underwent condensation,\nmust have been the epoch at which the mass-constitutive processes began.\nThat we may conceive these processes, then, as still going on in the\ncase of certain “nebulæ,” while in all other cases we find them\nthoroughly at an end, we are forced into assumptions for which we have\nreally _no_ basis whatever—we have to thrust in, again, upon the\nrevolting Reason, the blasphemous idea of special interposition—we have\r\nto suppose that, in the particular instances of these “nebulæ,” an\nunerring God found it necessary to introduce certain supplementary\nregulations—certain improvements of the general law—certain retouchings\nand emendations, in a word, which had the effect of deferring the\ncompletion of these individual stars for centuries of centuries beyond\nthe æra during which all the other stellar bodies had time, not only to\nbe fully constituted, but to grow hoary with an unspeakable old age.\n\nOf course, it will be immediately objected that since the light by which","we recognize the nebulæ now, must be merely that which left their\nsurfaces a vast number of years ago, the processes at present observed,\nor supposed to be observed, are, in fact, _not_ processes now actually\ngoing on, but the phantoms of processes completed long in the Past—just\nas I maintain all these mass-constitutive processes _must_ have been.\n\nTo this I reply that neither is the now-observed condition of the\ncondensed stars their actual condition, but a condition completed long\r\nin the Past; so that my argument drawn from the _relative_ condition of\nthe stars and the “nebulæ,” is in no manner disturbed. Moreover, those\nwho maintain the existence of nebulæ, do _not_ refer the nebulosity to\nextreme distance; they declare it a real and not merely a perspective\nnebulosity. That we may conceive, indeed, a nebular mass as visible at\nall, we must conceive it as _very near us_ in comparison with the\ncondensed stars brought into view by the modern telescopes. In\nmaintaining the appearances in question, then, to be really nebulous, we\r\nmaintain their comparative vicinity to our point of view. Thus, their\ncondition, as we see them now, must be referred to an epoch _far less\nremote_ than that to which we may refer the now-observed condition of at\nleast the majority of the stars.—In a word, should Astronomy ever\ndemonstrate a “nebula,” in the sense at present intended, I should\nconsider the Nebular Cosmogony—_not_, indeed, as corroborated by the\ndemonstration—but as thereby irretrievably overthrown.\n\nBy way, however, of rendering unto Cæsar _no more_ than the things that\r\nare Cæsar’s, let me here remark that the assumption of the hypothesis\nwhich led him to so glorious a result, seems to have been suggested to\nLaplace in great measure by a misconception—by the very misconception of\nwhich we have just been speaking—by the generally prevalent\nmisunderstanding of the character of the nebulæ, so mis-named. These he\nsupposed to be, in reality, what their designation implies. The fact is,\nthis great man had, very properly, an inferior faith in his own merely","_perceptive_ powers. In respect, therefore, to the actual existence of\nnebulæ—an existence so confidently maintained by his telescopic\ncontemporaries—he depended less upon what he saw than upon what he\nheard.\n\nIt will be seen that the only valid objections to his theory, are those\nmade to its hypothesis _as_ such—to what suggested it—not to what it\nsuggests; to its propositions rather than to its results. His most\nunwarranted assumption was that of giving the atoms a movement towards a\r\ncentre, in the very face of his evident understanding that these atoms,\nin unlimited succession, extended throughout the Universal space. I have\nalready shown that, under such circumstances, there could have occurred\nno movement at all; and Laplace, consequently, assumed one on no more\nphilosophical ground than that something of the kind was necessary for\nthe establishment of what he intended to establish.\n\nHis original idea seems to have been a compound of the true Epicurean\natoms with the false nebulæ of his contemporaries; and thus his theory\r\npresents us with the singular anomaly of absolute truth deduced, as a\nmathematical result, from a hybrid datum of ancient imagination\nintertangled with modern inacumen. Laplace’s real strength lay, in fact,\nin an almost miraculous mathematical instinct:—on this he relied; and in\nno instance did it fail or deceive him:—in the case of the Nebular\nCosmogony, it led him, blindfolded, through a labyrinth of Error, into\none of the most luminous and stupendous temples of Truth.\n\nLet us now fancy, for the moment, that the ring first thrown off by the\r\nSun—that is to say, the ring whose breaking-up constituted Neptune—did\nnot, in fact, break up until the throwing-off of the ring out of which\nUranus arose; that this latter ring, again, remained perfect until the\ndischarge of that out of which sprang Saturn; that this latter, again,\nremained entire until the discharge of that from which originated\nJupiter—and so on. Let us imagine, in a word, that no dissolution\noccurred among the rings until the final rejection of that which gave","birth to Mercury. We thus paint to the eye of the mind a series of\ncöexistent concentric circles; and looking as well at _them_ as at the\nprocesses by which, according to Laplace’s hypothesis, they were\nconstructed, we perceive at once a very singular analogy with the atomic\nstrata and the process of the original irradiation as I have described\nit. Is it impossible that, on measuring the _forces_, respectively, by\nwhich each successive planetary circle was thrown off—that is to say, on\nmeasuring the successive excesses of rotation over gravitation which\r\noccasioned the successive discharges—we should find the analogy in\nquestion more decidedly confirmed? _Is it improbable that we should\ndiscover these forces to have varied—as in the original\nradiation—proportionally to the squares of the distances?_\n\nOur solar system, consisting, in chief, of one sun, with sixteen planets\ncertainly, and possibly a few more, revolving about it at various\ndistances, and attended by seventeen moons assuredly, but _very_\nprobably by several others—is now to be considered as _an example_ of\r\nthe innumerable agglomerations which proceeded to take place throughout\nthe Universal Sphere of atoms on withdrawal of the Divine Volition. I\nmean to say that our solar system is to be understood as affording a\n_generic instance_ of these agglomerations, or, more correctly, of the\nulterior conditions at which they arrived. If we keep our attention\nfixed on the idea of _the utmost possible Relation_ as the Omnipotent\ndesign, and on the precautions taken to accomplish it through difference\r\nof form, among the original atoms, and particular inequidistance, we\nshall find it impossible to suppose for a moment that even any two of\nthe incipient agglomerations reached precisely the same result in the\nend. We shall rather be inclined to think that _no two_ stellar bodies\nin the Universe—whether suns, planets or moons—are particularly, while\n_all_ are generally, similar. Still less, then, can we imagine any two\n_assemblages_ of such bodies—any two “systems”—as having more than a\ngeneral resemblance.[10] Our telescopes, at this point, thoroughly","confirm our deductions. Taking our own solar system, then, as merely a\nloose or general type of all, we have so far proceeded in our subject as\nto survey the Universe under the aspect of a spherical space, throughout\nwhich, dispersed with merely general equability, exist a number of but\ngenerally similar _systems_.\n\n    [10] It is not _impossible_ that some unlooked-for optical\n    improvement may disclose to us, among innumerable varieties of\n    systems, a luminous sun, encircled by luminous and non-luminous\r\nrings, within and without and between which, revolve luminous\n    and non-luminous planets, attended by moons having moons—and\n    even these latter again having moons.\n\nLet us now, expanding our conceptions, look upon each of these systems\nas in itself an atom; which in fact it is, when we consider it as but\none of the countless myriads of systems which constitute the Universe.\nRegarding all, then, as but colossal atoms, each with the same\nineradicable tendency to Unity which characterizes the actual atoms of\r\nwhich it consists—we enter at once upon a new order of aggregations. The\nsmaller systems, in the vicinity of a larger one, would, inevitably, be\ndrawn into still closer vicinity. A thousand would assemble here; a\nmillion there—perhaps here, again, even a billion—leaving, thus,\nimmeasurable vacancies in space. And if now, it be demanded why, in the\ncase of these systems—of these merely Titanic atoms—I speak, simply, of\nan “assemblage,” and not, as in the case of the actual atoms, of a more\r\nor less consolidated agglomeration:—if it be asked, for instance, why I\ndo not carry what I suggest to its legitimate conclusion, and describe,\nat once, these assemblages of system-atoms as rushing to consolidation\nin spheres—as each becoming condensed into one magnificent sun—my reply\nis that μελλοντα ταυτα—I am but pausing, for a moment, on the awful\nthreshold of _the Future_. For the present, calling these assemblages\n“clusters,” we see them in the incipient stages of their consolidation.\nTheir _absolute_ consolidation is _to come_.","We have now reached a point from which we behold the Universe as a\nspherical space, interspersed, _unequably_, with _clusters_. It will be\nnoticed that I here prefer the adverb “unequably” to the phrase “with a\nmerely general equability,” employed before. It is evident, in fact,\nthat the equability of distribution will diminish in the ratio of the\nagglomerative processes—that is to say, as the things distributed\ndiminish in number. Thus the increase of _in_-equability—an increase\nwhich must continue until, sooner or later, an epoch will arrive at\r\nwhich the largest agglomeration will absorb all the others—should be\nviewed as, simply, a corroborative indication of the _tendency to One_.\n\nAnd here, at length, it seems proper to inquire whether the ascertained\n_facts_ of Astronomy confirm the general arrangement which I have thus,\ndeductively, assigned to the Heavens. Thoroughly, they _do_. Telescopic\nobservation, guided by the laws of perspective, enables us to understand\nthat the perceptible Universe exists as _a cluster of clusters,\nirregularly disposed_.\r\nThe “clusters” of which this Universal “_cluster of clusters_” consists,\nare merely what we have been in the practice of designating\n“nebulæ”—and, of these “nebulæ,” _one_ is of paramount interest to\nmankind. I allude to the Galaxy, or Milky Way. This interests us, first\nand most obviously, on account of its great superiority in apparent\nsize, not only to any one other cluster in the firmament, but to all the\nother clusters taken together. The largest of these latter occupies a\nmere point, comparatively, and is distinctly seen only with the aid of a\r\ntelescope. The Galaxy sweeps throughout the Heaven and is brilliantly\nvisible to the naked eye. But it interests man chiefly, although less\nimmediately, on account of its being his home; the home of the Earth on\nwhich he exists; the home of the Sun about which this Earth revolves;\nthe home of that “system” of orbs of which the Sun is the centre and\nprimary—the Earth one of sixteen secondaries, or planets—the Moon one of\nseventeen tertiaries, or satellites. The Galaxy, let me repeat, is but","one of the _clusters_ which I have been describing—but one of the\nmis-called “nebulæ” revealed to us—by the telescope alone, sometimes—as\nfaint hazy spots in various quarters of the sky. We have no reason to\nsuppose the Milky Way _really_ more extensive than the least of these\n“nebulæ.” Its vast superiority in size is but an apparent superiority\narising from our position in regard to it—that is to say, from our\nposition in its midst. However strange the assertion may at first appear\nto those unversed in Astronomy, still the astronomer himself has no\r\nhesitation in asserting that we are _in the midst_ of that inconceivable\nhost of stars—of suns—of systems—which constitute the Galaxy. Moreover,\nnot only have _we_—not only has _our_ Sun a right to claim the Galaxy as\nits own especial cluster, but, with slight reservation, it may be said\nthat all the distinctly visible stars of the firmament—all the stars\nVisible to the naked eye—have equally a right to claim it as _their_\nown.\n\nThere has been a great deal of misconception in respect to the _shape_\r\nof the Galaxy; which, in nearly all our astronomical treatises, is said\nto resemble that of a capital Y. The cluster in question has, in\nreality, a certain general—_very_ general resemblance to the planet\nSaturn, with its encompassing triple ring. Instead of the solid orb of\nthat planet, however, we must picture to ourselves a lenticular\nstar-island, or collection of stars; our Sun lying excentrically—near\nthe shore of the island—on that side of it which is nearest the\r\nconstellation of the Cross and farthest from that of Cassiopeia. The\nsurrounding ring, where it approaches our position, has in it a\nlongitudinal _gash_, which does, in fact, cause _the ring, in our\nvicinity_, to assume, loosely, the appearance of a capital Y.\n\nWe must not fall into the error, however, of conceiving the somewhat\nindefinite girdle as at all _remote_, comparatively speaking, from the\nalso indefinite lenticular cluster which it surrounds; and thus, for\nmere purpose of explanation, we may speak of our Sun as actually","situated at that point of the Y where its three component lines unite;\nand, conceiving this letter to be of a certain solidity—of a certain\nthickness, very trivial in comparison with its length—we may even speak\nof our position as _in the middle_ of this thickness. Fancying ourselves\nthus placed, we shall no longer find difficulty in accounting for the\nphænomena presented—which are perspective altogether. When we look\nupward or downward—that is to say, when we cast our eyes in the\ndirection of the letter’s _thickness_—we look through fewer stars than\r\nwhen we cast them in the direction of its _length_, or _along_ either of\nthe three component lines. Of course, in the former case, the stars\nappear scattered—in the latter, crowded.—To reverse this explanation:—An\ninhabitant of the Earth, when looking, as we commonly express ourselves,\n_at_ the Galaxy, is then beholding it in some of the directions of its\nlength—is looking _along_ the lines of the Y—but when, looking out into\nthe general Heaven, he turns his eyes _from_ the Galaxy, he is then\r\nsurveying it in the direction of the letter’s thickness; and on this\naccount the stars seem to him scattered; while, in fact, they are as\nclose together, on an average, as in the mass of the cluster. _No_\nconsideration could be better adapted to convey an idea of this\ncluster’s stupendous extent.\n\nIf, with a telescope of high space-penetrating power, we carefully\ninspect the firmament, we shall become aware of _a belt of clusters_—of\nwhat we have hitherto called “nebulæ”—a _band_, of varying breadth,\r\nstretching from horizon to horizon, at right angles to the general\ncourse of the Milky Way. This band is the ultimate _cluster of\nclusters_. This belt is _The Universe_. Our Galaxy is but one, and\nperhaps one of the most inconsiderable, of the clusters which go to the\nconstitution of this ultimate, Universal _belt_ or _band_. The\nappearance of this cluster of clusters, to our eyes, _as_ a belt or\nband, is altogether a perspective phænomenon of the same character as\nthat which causes us to behold our own individual and roughly-spherical","cluster, the Galaxy, under guise also of a belt, traversing the Heavens\nat right angles to the Universal one. The shape of the all-inclusive\ncluster is, of course _generally_, that of each individual cluster which\nit includes. Just as the scattered stars which, on looking _from_ the\nGalaxy, we see in the general sky, are, in fact, but a portion of that\nGalaxy itself, and as closely intermingled with it as any of the\ntelescopic points in what seems the densest portion of its mass—so are\r\nthe scattered “nebulæ” which, on casting our eyes _from_ the Universal\n_belt_, we perceive at all points of the firmament—so, I say, are these\nscattered “nebulæ” to be understood as only perspectively scattered, and\nas part and parcel of the one supreme and Universal _sphere_.\n\nNo astronomical fallacy is more untenable, and none has been more\npertinaciously adhered to, than that of the absolute _illimitation_ of\nthe Universe of Stars. The reasons for limitation, as I have already\nassigned them, _à priori_, seem to me unanswerable; but, not to speak of\r\nthese, _observation_ assures us that there is, in numerous directions\naround us, certainly, if not in all, a positive limit—or, at the very\nleast, affords us no basis whatever for thinking otherwise. Were the\nsuccession of stars endless, then the background of the sky would\npresent us an uniform luminosity, like that displayed by the\nGalaxy—_since there could be absolutely no point, in all that\nbackground, at which would not exist a star._ The only mode, therefore,\nin which, under such a state of affairs, we could comprehend the _voids_\r\nwhich our telescopes find in innumerable directions, would be by\nsupposing the distance of the invisible background so immense that no\nray from it has yet been able to reach us at all. That this _may_ be so,\nwho shall venture to deny? I maintain, simply, that we have not even the\nshadow of a reason for believing that it _is_ so.\n\nWhen speaking of the vulgar propensity to regard all bodies on the Earth\nas tending merely to the Earth’s centre, I observed that, “with certain","exceptions to be specified hereafter, every body on the Earth tended not\nonly to the Earth’s centre, but in every conceivable direction\nbesides.”[11] The “exceptions” refer to those frequent gaps in the\nHeavens, where our utmost scrutiny can detect not only no stellar\nbodies, but no indications of their existence:—where yawning chasms,\nblacker than Erebus, seem to afford us glimpses, through the boundary\nwalls of the Universe of Stars, into the illimitable Universe of\nVacancy, beyond. Now as any body, existing on the Earth, chances to\r\npass, either through its own movement or the Earth’s, into a line with\nany one of these voids, or cosmical abysses, it clearly is no longer\nattracted _in the direction of that void_, and for the moment,\nconsequently, is “heavier” than at any period, either after or before.\nIndependently of the consideration of these voids, however, and looking\nonly at the generally unequable distribution of the stars, we see that\nthe absolute tendency of bodies on the Earth to the Earth’s centre, is\nin a state of perpetual variation.\r\n[11] Page 62.\n\nWe comprehend, then, the insulation of our Universe. We perceive the\nisolation of _that_—of _all_ that which we grasp with the senses. We\nknow that there exists one _cluster of clusters_—a collection around\nwhich, on all sides, extend the immeasurable wildernesses of a Space _to\nall human perception_ untenanted. But _because_ upon the confines of\nthis Universe of Stars we are compelled to pause, through want of\nfarther evidence from the senses, is it right to conclude that, in fact,\r\nthere _is_ no material point beyond that which we have thus been\npermitted to attain? Have we, or have we not, an analogical right to the\ninference that this perceptible Universe—that this cluster of\nclusters—is but one of _a series_ of clusters of clusters, the rest of\nwhich are invisible through distance—through the diffusion of their\nlight being so excessive, ere it reaches us, as not to produce upon our\nretinas a light-impression—or from there being no such emanation as\nlight at all, in these unspeakably distant worlds—or, lastly, from the","mere interval being so vast, that the electric tidings of their presence\nin Space, have not yet—through the lapsing myriads of years—been enabled\nto traverse that interval?\n\nHave we any right to inferences—have we any ground whatever for visions\nsuch as these? If we have a right to them in _any_ degree, we have a\nright to their infinite extension.\n\nThe human brain has obviously a leaning to the “_Infinite_,” and fondles\nthe phantom of the idea. It seems to long with a passionate fervor for\r\nthis impossible conception, with the hope of intellectually believing it\nwhen conceived. What is general among the whole race of Man, of course\nno individual of that race can be warranted in considering abnormal;\nnevertheless, there _may_ be a class of superior intelligences, to whom\nthe human bias alluded to may wear all the character of monomania.\n\nMy question, however, remains unanswered:—Have we any right to infer—let\nus say, rather, to imagine—an interminable succession of the “clusters\nof clusters,” or of “Universes” more or less similar?\r\nI reply that the “right,” in a case such as this, depends absolutely\nupon the hardihood of that imagination which ventures to claim the\nright. Let me declare, only, that, as an individual, I myself feel\nimpelled to the _fancy_—without daring to call it more—that there _does_\nexist a _limitless_ succession of Universes, more or less similar to\nthat of which we have cognizance—to that of which _alone_ we shall ever\nhave cognizance—at the very least until the return of our own particular\r\nUniverse into Unity. _If_ such clusters of clusters exist, however—_and\nthey do_—it is abundantly clear that, having had no part in our origin,\nthey have no portion in our laws. They neither attract us, nor we them.\nTheir material—their spirit is not ours—is not that which obtains in any\npart of our Universe. They could not impress our senses or our souls.\nAmong them and us—considering all, for the moment, collectively—there\nare no influences in common. Each exists, apart and independently, _in\nthe bosom of its proper and particular God_.","In the conduct of this Discourse, I am aiming less at physical than at\nmetaphysical order. The clearness with which even material phænomena are\npresented to the understanding, depends very little, I have long since\nlearned to perceive, upon a merely natural, and almost altogether upon a\nmoral, arrangement. If then I seem to step somewhat too discursively\nfrom point to point of my topic, let me suggest that I do so in the hope\nof thus the better keeping unbroken that chain of _graduated impression_\r\nby which alone the intellect of Man can expect to encompass the\ngrandeurs of which I speak, and, in their majestic totality, to\ncomprehend them.\n\nSo far, our attention has been directed, almost exclusively, to a\ngeneral and relative grouping of the stellar bodies in space. Of\nspecification there has been little; and whatever ideas of _quantity_\nhave been conveyed—that is to say, of number, magnitude, and\ndistance—have been conveyed incidentally and by way of preparation for\nmore definitive conceptions. These latter let us now attempt to\r\nentertain.\n\nOur solar system, as has been already mentioned, consists, in chief, of\none sun and sixteen planets certainly, but in all probability a few\nothers, revolving around it as a centre, and attended by seventeen moons\nof which we know, with possibly several more of which as yet we know\nnothing. These various bodies are not true spheres, but oblate\nspheroids—spheres flattened at the poles of the imaginary axes about\nwhich they rotate:—the flattening being a consequence of the rotation.\r\nNeither is the Sun absolutely the centre of the system; for this Sun\nitself, with all the planets, revolves about a perpetually shifting\npoint of space, which is the system’s general centre of gravity. Neither\nare we to consider the paths through which these different spheroids\nmove—the moons about the planets, the planets about the Sun, or the Sun\nabout the common centre—as circles in an accurate sense. They are, in\nfact, _ellipses—one of the foci being the point about which the\nrevolution is made_. An ellipse is a curve, returning into itself, one","of whose diameters is longer than the other. In the longer diameter are\ntwo points, equidistant from the middle of the line, and so situated\notherwise that if, from each of them a straight line be drawn to any one\npoint of the curve, the two lines, taken together, will be equal to the\nlonger diameter itself. Now let us conceive such an ellipse. At one of\nthe points mentioned, which are the _foci_, let us fasten an orange. By\nan elastic thread let us connect this orange with a pea; and let us\r\nplace this latter on the circumference of the ellipse. Let us now move\nthe pea continuously around the orange—keeping always on the\ncircumference of the ellipse. The elastic thread, which, of course,\nvaries in length as we move the pea, will form what in geometry is\ncalled a _radius vector_. Now, if the orange be understood as the Sun,\nand the pea as a planet revolving about it, then the revolution should\nbe made at such a rate—with a velocity so varying—that the _radius\nvector_ may pass over _equal areas of space in equal times_. The\r\nprogress of the pea _should be_—in other words, the progress of the\nplanet _is_, of course,—slow in proportion to its distance from the\nSun—swift in proportion to its proximity. Those planets, moreover, move\nthe more slowly which are the farther from the Sun; _the squares of\ntheir periods of revolution having the same proportion to each other, as\nhave to each other the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun_.\n\nThe wonderfully complex laws of revolution here described, however, are\r\nnot to be understood as obtaining in our system alone. They _everywhere_\nprevail where Attraction prevails. They control _the Universe_. Every\nshining speck in the firmament is, no doubt, a luminous sun, resembling\nour own, at least in its general features, and having in attendance upon\nit a greater or less number of planets, greater or less, whose still\nlingering luminosity is not sufficient to render them visible to us at\nso vast a distance, but which, nevertheless, revolve, moon-attended,\nabout their starry centres, in obedience to the principles just","detailed—in obedience to the three omniprevalent laws of revolution—the\nthree immortal laws _guessed_ by the imaginative Kepler, and but\nsubsequently demonstrated and accounted for by the patient and\nmathematical Newton. Among a tribe of philosophers who pride themselves\nexcessively upon matter-of-fact, it is far too fashionable to sneer at\nall speculation under the comprehensive _sobriquet_, “guess-work.” The\npoint to be considered is, _who_ guesses. In guessing with Plato, we\r\nspend our time to better purpose, now and then, than in hearkening to a\ndemonstration by Alcmæon.\n\nIn many works on Astronomy I find it distinctly stated that the laws of\nKepler are _the basis_ of the great principle, Gravitation. This idea\nmust have arisen from the fact that the suggestion of these laws by\nKepler, and his proving them _à posteriori_ to have an actual existence,\nled Newton to account for them by the hypothesis of Gravitation, and,\nfinally, to demonstrate them _à priori_, as necessary consequences of\r\nthe hypothetical principle. Thus so far from the laws of Kepler being\nthe basis of Gravity, Gravity is the basis of these laws—as it is,\nindeed, of all the laws of the material Universe which are not referable\nto Repulsion alone.\n\nThe mean distance of the Earth from the Moon—that is to say, from the\nheavenly body in our closest vicinity—is 237,000 miles. Mercury, the\nplanet nearest the Sun, is distant from him 37 millions of miles. Venus,\nthe next, revolves at a distance of 68 millions:—the Earth, which comes\r\nnext, at a distance of 95 millions:—Mars, then, at a distance of 144\nmillions. Now come the eight Asteroids (Ceres, Juno, Vesta, Pallas,\nAstræa, Flora, Iris, and Hebe) at an average distance of about 250\nmillions. Then we have Jupiter, distant 490 millions; then Saturn, 900\nmillions; then Uranus, 19 hundred millions; finally Neptune, lately\ndiscovered, and revolving at a distance, say of 28 hundred millions.\nLeaving Neptune out of the account—of which as yet we know little\naccurately and which is, possibly, one of a system of Asteroids—it will","be seen that, within certain limits, there exists an _order of interval_\namong the planets. Speaking loosely, we may say that each outer planet\nis twice as far from the Sun as is the next inner one. May not the\n_order_ here mentioned—_may not the law of Bode—be deduced from\nconsideration of the analogy suggested by me as having place between the\nsolar discharge of rings and the mode of the atomic irradiation_?\n\nThe numbers hurriedly mentioned in this summary of distance, it is folly\r\nto attempt comprehending, unless in the light of abstract arithmetical\nfacts. They are not practically tangible ones. They convey no precise\nideas. I have stated that Neptune, the planet farthest from the Sun,\nrevolves about him at a distance of 28 hundred millions of miles. So far\ngood:—I have stated a mathematical fact; and, without comprehending it\nin the least, we may put it to use—mathematically. But in mentioning,\neven, that the Moon revolves about the Earth at the comparatively\ntrifling distance of 237,000 miles, I entertained no expectation of\r\ngiving any one to understand—to know—to feel—how far from the Earth the\nMoon actually _is_. 237,000 _miles_! There are, perhaps, few of my\nreaders who have not crossed the Atlantic ocean; yet how many of them\nhave a distinct idea of even the 3,000 miles intervening between shore\nand shore? I doubt, indeed, whether the man lives who can force into his\nbrain the most remote conception of the interval between one milestone\nand its next neighbor upon the turnpike. We are in some measure aided,\nhowever, in our consideration of distance, by combining this\r\nconsideration with the kindred one of velocity. Sound passes through\n1100 feet of space in a second of time. Now were it possible for an\ninhabitant of the Earth to see the flash of a cannon discharged in the\nMoon, and to hear the report, he would have to wait, after perceiving\nthe former, more than 13 entire days and nights before getting any\nintimation of the latter.\n\nHowever feeble be the impression, even thus conveyed, of the Moon’s real\ndistance from the Earth, it will, nevertheless, effect a good object in","enabling us more clearly to see the futility of attempting to grasp such\nintervals as that of the 28 hundred millions of miles between our Sun\nand Neptune; or even that of the 95 millions between the Sun and the\nEarth we inhabit. A cannon-ball, flying at the greatest velocity with\nwhich such a ball has ever been known to fly, could not traverse the\nlatter interval in less than 20 years; while for the former it would\nrequire 590.\n\nOur Moon’s real diameter is 2160 miles; yet she is comparatively so\r\ntrifling an object that it would take nearly 50 such orbs to compose one\nas great as the Earth.\n\nThe diameter of our own globe is 7912 miles—but from the enunciation of\nthese numbers what positive idea do we derive?\n\nIf we ascend an ordinary mountain and look around us from its summit, we\nbehold a landscape stretching, say 40 miles, in every direction; forming\na circle 250 miles in circumference; and including an area of 5000\nsquare miles. The extent of such a prospect, on account of the\n_successiveness_ with which its portions necessarily present themselves\r\nto view, can be only very feebly and very partially appreciated:—yet the\nentire panorama would comprehend no more than one 40,000th part of the\nmere _surface_ of our globe. Were this panorama, then, to be succeeded,\nafter the lapse of an hour, by another of equal extent; this again by a\nthird, after the lapse of another hour; this again by a fourth after\nlapse of another hour—and so on, until the scenery of the whole Earth\nwere exhausted; and were we to be engaged in examining these various\r\npanoramas for twelve hours of every day; we should nevertheless, be 9\nyears and 48 days in completing the general survey.\n\nBut if the mere surface of the Earth eludes the grasp of the\nimagination, what are we to think of its cubical contents? It embraces a\nmass of matter equal in weight to at least 2 sextillions, 200\nquintillions of tons. Let us suppose it in a state of quiescence; and\nnow let us endeavor to conceive a mechanical force sufficient to set it\nin motion! Not the strength of all the myriads of beings whom we may","conclude to inhabit the planetary worlds of our system—not the combined\nphysical strength of _all_ these beings—even admitting all to be more\npowerful than man—would avail to stir the ponderous mass _a single inch_\nfrom its position.\n\nWhat are we to understand, then, of the force, which under similar\ncircumstances, would be required to move the _largest_ of our planets,\nJupiter? This is 86,000 miles in diameter, and would include within its\nperiphery more than a thousand orbs of the magnitude of our own. Yet\r\nthis stupendous body is actually flying around the Sun at the rate of\n29,000 miles an hour—that is to say, with a velocity 40 times greater\nthan that of a cannon-ball! The thought of such a phænomenon cannot well\nbe said to _startle_ the mind:—it palsies and appals it. Not\nunfrequently we task our imagination in picturing the capacities of an\nangel. Let us fancy such a being at a distance of some hundred miles\nfrom Jupiter—a close eye-witness of this planet as it speeds on its\nannual revolution. Now _can_ we, I demand, fashion for ourselves any\r\nconception so distinct of this ideal being’s spiritual exaltation, as\n_that_ involved in the supposition that, even by this immeasurable mass\nof matter, whirled immediately before his eyes, with a velocity so\nunutterable, he—an angel—angelic though he be—is not at once struck into\nnothingness and overwhelmed?\n\nAt this point, however, it seems proper to suggest that, in fact, we\nhave been speaking of comparative trifles. Our Sun, the central and\ncontrolling orb of the system to which Jupiter belongs, is not only\r\ngreater than Jupiter, but greater by far than all the planets of the\nsystem taken together. This fact is an essential condition, indeed, of\nthe stability of the system itself. The diameter of Jupiter has been\nmentioned:—it is 86,000 miles:—that of the Sun is 882,000 miles. An\ninhabitant of the latter, travelling 90 miles a day, would be more than\n80 years in going round a great circle of its circumference. It occupies\na cubical space of 681 quadrillions, 472 trillions of miles. The Moon,","as has been stated, revolves about the Earth at a distance of 237,000\nmiles—in an orbit, consequently, of nearly a million and a half. Now,\nwere the Sun placed upon the Earth, centre over centre, the body of the\nformer would extend, in every direction, not only to the line of the\nMoon’s orbit, but beyond it, a distance of 200,000 miles.\n\nAnd here, once again, let me suggest that, in fact, we have _still_ been\nspeaking of comparative trifles. The distance of the planet Neptune from\r\nthe Sun has been stated:—it is 28 hundred millions of miles; the\ncircumference of its orbit, therefore, is about 17 billions. Let this be\nborne in mind while we glance at some one of the brightest stars.\nBetween this and the star of _our_ system, (the Sun,) there is a gulf of\nspace, to convey any idea of which we should need the tongue of an\narchangel. From _our_ system, then, and from _our_ Sun, or star, the\nstar at which we suppose ourselves glancing is a thing altogether\napart:—still, for the moment, let us imagine it placed upon our Sun,\r\ncentre over centre, as we just now imagined this Sun itself placed upon\nthe Earth. Let us now conceive the particular star we have in mind,\nextending, in every direction, beyond the orbit of Mercury—of Venus—of\nthe Earth:—still _on_, beyond the orbit of Mars—of Jupiter—of\nUranus—until, finally, we fancy it filling the circle—17 _billions of\nmiles in circumference_—which is described by the revolution of\nLeverrier’s planet. When we have conceived all this, we shall have\nentertained no extravagant conception. There is the very best reason for\r\nbelieving that many of the stars are even far larger than the one we\nhave imagined. I mean to say that we have the very best _empirical_\nbasis for such belief:—and, in looking back at the original, atomic\narrangements for _diversity_, which have been assumed as a part of the\nDivine plan in the constitution of the Universe, we shall be enabled\neasily to understand, and to credit, the existence of even far vaster\ndisproportions in stellar size than any to which I have hitherto","alluded. The largest orbs, of course, we must expect to find rolling\nthrough the widest vacancies of Space.\n\nI remarked, just now, that to convey an idea of the interval between our\nSun and any one of the other stars, we should require the eloquence of\nan archangel. In so saying, I should not be accused of exaggeration;\nfor, in simple truth, these are topics on which it is scarcely possible\nto exaggerate. But let us bring the matter more distinctly before the\neye of the mind.\n\nIn the first place, we may get a general, _relative_ conception of the\r\ninterval referred to, by comparing it with the inter-planetary spaces.\nIf, for example, we suppose the Earth, which is, in reality, 95 millions\nof miles from the Sun, to be only _one foot_ from that luminary; then\nNeptune would be 40 feet distant; _and the star Alpha Lyræ, at the very\nleast_, 159.\n\nNow I presume that, in the termination of my last sentence, few of my\nreaders have noticed anything especially objectionable—particularly\nwrong. I said that the distance of the Earth from the Sun being taken at\r\n_one foot_, the distance of Neptune would be 40 feet, and that of Alpha\nLyræ, 159. The proportion between one foot and 159 has appeared,\nperhaps, to convey a sufficiently definite impression of the proportion\nbetween the two intervals—that of the Earth from the Sun and that of\nAlpha Lyræ from the same luminary. But my account of the matter should,\nin reality, have run thus:—The distance of the Earth from the Sun being\ntaken at one foot, the distance of Neptune would be 40 feet, and that of\nAlpha Lyræ, 159——_miles_:—that is to say, I had assigned to Alpha Lyræ,\r\nin my first statement of the case, only the 5280_th_ _part_ of that\ndistance which is the _least distance possible_ at which it can actually\nlie.\n\nTo proceed:—However distant a mere _planet_ is, yet when we look at it\nthrough a telescope, we see it under a certain form—of a certain\nappreciable size. Now I have already hinted at the probable bulk of many\nof the stars; nevertheless, when we view any one of them, even through\nthe most powerful telescope, it is found to present us with _no form_,","and consequently with _no magnitude_ whatever. We see it as a point and\nnothing more.\n\nAgain;—Let us suppose ourselves walking, at night, on a highway. In a\nfield on one side of the road, is a line of tall objects, say trees, the\nfigures of which are distinctly defined against the background of the\nsky. This line of objects extends at right angles to the road, and from\nthe road to the horizon. Now, as we proceed along the road, we see these\nobjects changing their positions, respectively, in relation to a certain\r\nfixed point in that portion of the firmament which forms the background\nof the view. Let us suppose this fixed point—sufficiently fixed for our\npurpose—to be the rising moon. We become aware, at once, that while the\ntree nearest us so far alters its position in respect to the moon, as to\nseem flying behind us, the tree in the extreme distance has scarcely\nchanged at all its relative position with the satellite. We then go on\nto perceive that the farther the objects are from us, the less they\nalter their positions; and the converse. Then we begin, unwittingly, to\r\nestimate the distances of individual trees by the degrees in which they\nevince the relative alteration. Finally, we come to understand how it\nmight be possible to ascertain the actual distance of any given tree in\nthe line, by using the amount of relative alteration as a basis in a\nsimple geometrical problem. Now this relative alteration is what we call\n“parallax;” and by parallax we calculate the distances of the heavenly\nbodies. Applying the principle to the trees in question, we should, of\r\ncourse, be very much at a loss to comprehend the distance of _that_\ntree, which, however far we proceeded along the road, should evince _no_\nparallax at all. This, in the case described, is a thing impossible; but\nimpossible only because all distances on our Earth are trivial\nindeed:—in comparison with the vast cosmical quantities, we may speak of\nthem as absolutely nothing.\n\nNow, let us suppose the star Alpha Lyræ directly overhead; and let us\nimagine that, instead of standing on the Earth, we stand at one end of a","straight road stretching through Space to a distance equalling the\ndiameter of the Earth’s orbit—that is to say, to a distance of 190\n_millions of miles_. Having observed, by means of the most delicate\nmicrometrical instruments, the exact position of the star, let us now\npass along this inconceivable road, until we reach its other extremity.\nNow, once again, let us look at the star. It is _precisely_ where we\nleft it. Our instruments, however delicate, assure us that its relative\r\nposition is absolutely—is identically the same as at the commencement of\nour unutterable journey. _No_ parallax—none whatever—has been found.\n\nThe fact is, that, in regard to the distance of the fixed stars—of any\none of the myriads of suns glistening on the farther side of that awful\nchasm which separates our system from its brothers in the cluster to\nwhich it belongs—astronomical science, until very lately, could speak\nonly with a negative certainty. Assuming the brightest as the nearest,\nwe could say, even of _them_, only that there is a certain\r\nincomprehensible distance on the _hither_ side of which they cannot\nbe:—how far they are beyond it we had in no case been able to ascertain.\nWe perceived, for example, that Alpha Lyræ cannot be nearer to us than\n19 trillions, 200 billions of miles; but, for all we knew, and indeed\nfor all we now know, it may be distant from us the square, or the cube,\nor any other power of the number mentioned. By dint, however, of\nwonderfully minute and cautious observations, continued, with novel\ninstruments, for many laborious years, _Bessel_, not long ago deceased,\r\nhas lately succeeded in determining the distance of six or seven stars;\namong others, that of the star numbered 61 in the constellation of the\nSwan. The distance in this latter instance ascertained, is 670,000 times\nthat of the Sun; which last it will be remembered, is 95 millions of\nmiles. The star 61 Cygni, then, is nearly 64 trillions of miles from\nus—or more than three times the distance assigned, _as the least\npossible_, for Alpha Lyræ.\n\nIn attempting to appreciate this interval by the aid of any","considerations of _velocity_, as we did in endeavoring to estimate the\ndistance of the moon, we must leave out of sight, altogether, such\nnothings as the speed of a cannon-ball, or of sound. Light, however,\naccording to the latest calculations of Struve, proceeds at the rate of\n167,000 miles in a second. Thought itself cannot pass through this\ninterval more speedily—if, indeed, thought can traverse it at all. Yet,\nin coming from 61 Cygni to us, even at this inconceivable rate, light\r\noccupies more than _ten years_; and, consequently, were the star this\nmoment blotted out from the Universe, still, _for ten years_, would it\ncontinue to sparkle on, undimmed in its paradoxical glory.\n\nKeeping now in mind whatever feeble conception we may have attained of\nthe interval between our Sun and 61 Cygni, let us remember that this\ninterval, however unutterably vast, we are permitted to consider as but\nthe _average_ interval among the countless host of stars composing that\ncluster, or “nebula,” to which our system, as well as that of 61 Cygni,\r\nbelongs. I have, in fact, stated the case with great moderation:—we have\nexcellent reason for believing 61 Cygni to be one of the _nearest_\nstars, and thus for concluding, at least for the present, that its\ndistance from us is _less_ than the average distance between star and\nstar in the magnificent cluster of the Milky Way.\n\nAnd here, once again and finally, it seems proper to suggest that even\nas yet we have been speaking of trifles. Ceasing to wonder at the space\nbetween star and star in our own or in any particular cluster, let us\r\nrather turn our thoughts to the intervals between cluster and cluster,\nin the all comprehensive cluster of the Universe.\n\nI have already said that light proceeds at the rate of 167,000 miles in\na second—that is, about 10 millions of miles in a minute, or about 600\nmillions of miles in an hour:—yet so far removed from us are some of\nthe “nebulæ” that even light, speeding with this velocity, could not\nand does not reach us, from those mysterious regions, in less than 3\n_millions of years_. This calculation, moreover, is made by the elder","Herschell, and in reference merely to those comparatively proximate\nclusters within the scope of his own telescope. There _are_ “nebulæ,”\nhowever, which, through the magical tube of Lord Rosse, are this instant\nwhispering in our ears the secrets of _a million of ages_ by-gone. In a\nword, the events which we behold now—at this moment—in those worlds—are\nthe identical events which interested their inhabitants _ten hundred\nthousand centuries ago_. In intervals—in distances such as this\nsuggestion forces upon the _soul_—rather than upon the mind—we find, at\r\nlength, a fitting climax to all hitherto frivolous considerations of\n_quantity_.\n\nOur fancies thus occupied with the cosmical distances, let us take the\nopportunity of referring to the difficulty which we have so often\nexperienced, while pursuing _the beaten path_ of astronomical\nreflection, _in accounting_ for the immeasurable voids alluded to—in\ncomprehending why chasms so totally unoccupied and therefore apparently\nso needless, have been made to intervene between star and star—between\r\ncluster and cluster—in understanding, to be brief, a sufficient reason\nfor the Titanic scale, in respect of mere _Space_, on which the Universe\nis seen to be constructed. A rational cause for the phænomenon, I\nmaintain that Astronomy has palpably failed to assign:—but the\nconsiderations through which, in this Essay, we have proceeded step by\nstep, enable us clearly and immediately to perceive that _Space and\nDuration are one_. That the Universe might _endure_ throughout an æra\nat all commensurate with the grandeur of its component material portions\r\nand with the high majesty of its spiritual purposes, it was necessary\nthat the original atomic diffusion be made to so inconceivable an extent\nas to be only not infinite. It was required, in a word, that the stars\nshould be gathered into visibility from invisible nebulosity—proceed\nfrom nebulosity to consolidation—and so grow grey in giving birth and\ndeath to unspeakably numerous and complex variations of vitalic\ndevelopment:—it was required that the stars should do all this—should","have time thoroughly to accomplish all these Divine purposes—_during the\nperiod_ in which all things were effecting their return into Unity with\na velocity accumulating in the inverse proportion of the squares of the\ndistances at which lay the inevitable End.\n\nThroughout all this we have no difficulty in understanding the absolute\naccuracy of the Divine _adaptation_. The density of the stars,\nrespectively, proceeds, of course, as their condensation diminishes;\ncondensation and heterogeneity keep pace with each other; through the\r\nlatter, which is the index of the former, we estimate the vitalic and\nspiritual development. Thus, in the density of the globes, we have the\nmeasure in which their purposes are fulfilled. _As_ density\nproceeds—_as_ the divine intentions _are_ accomplished—_as_ less and\nstill less remains _to be_ accomplished—so—in the same ratio—should we\nexpect to find an acceleration of _the End_:—and thus the philosophical\nmind will easily comprehend that the Divine designs in constituting the\r\nstars, advance _mathematically_ to their fulfilment:—and more; it will\nreadily give the advance a mathematical expression; it will decide that\nthis advance is inversely proportional with the squares of the distances\nof all created things from the starting-point and goal of their\ncreation.\n\nNot only is this Divine adaptation, however, mathematically accurate,\nbut there is that about it which stamps it _as divine_, in distinction\nfrom that which is merely the work of human constructiveness. I allude\r\nto the complete _mutuality_ of adaptation. For example; in human\nconstructions a particular cause has a particular effect; a particular\nintention brings to pass a particular object; but this is all; we see no\nreciprocity. The effect does not re-act upon the cause; the intention\ndoes not change relations with the object. In Divine constructions the\nobject is either design or object as we choose to regard it—and we may\ntake at any time a cause for an effect, or the converse—so that we can\nnever absolutely decide which is which.","To give an instance:—In polar climates the human frame, to maintain its\nanimal heat, requires, for combustion in the capillary system, an\nabundant supply of highly azotized food, such as train-oil. But\nagain:—in polar climates nearly the sole food afforded man is the oil of\nabundant seals and whales. Now, whether is oil at hand because\nimperatively demanded, or the only thing demanded because the only thing\nto be obtained? It is impossible to decide. There is an absolute\n_reciprocity of adaptation_.\r\nThe pleasure which we derive from any display of human ingenuity is in\nthe ratio of _the approach_ to this species of reciprocity. In the\nconstruction of _plot_, for example, in fictitious literature, we\nshould aim at so arranging the incidents that we shall not be able to\ndetermine, of any one of them, whether it depends from any one other or\nupholds it. In this sense, of course, _perfection_ of _plot_ is really,\nor practically, unattainable—but only because it is a finite\nintelligence that constructs. The plots of God are perfect. The Universe\r\nis a plot of God.\n\nAnd now we have reached a point at which the intellect is forced, again,\nto struggle against its propensity for analogical inference—against its\nmonomaniac grasping at the infinite. Moons have been seen _revolving_\nabout planets; planets about stars; and the poetical instinct of\nhumanity—its instinct of the symmetrical, if the symmetry be but a\nsymmetry of surface:—this _instinct_, which the Soul, not only of Man\nbut of all created beings, took up, in the beginning, from the\r\n_geometrical_ basis of the Universal irradiation—impels us to the fancy\nof an endless extension of this system of _cycles_. Closing our eyes\nequally to _de_duction and _in_duction, we insist upon imagining a\n_revolution_ of all the orbs of the Galaxy about some gigantic globe\nwhich we take to be the central pivot of the whole. Each cluster in the\ngreat cluster of clusters is imagined, of course, to be similarly\nsupplied and constructed; while, that the “analogy” may be wanting at no\npoint, we go on to conceive these clusters themselves, again, as","_revolving_ about some still more august sphere;—this latter, still\nagain, _with_ its encircling clusters, as but one of a yet more\nmagnificent series of agglomerations, _gyrating_ about yet another orb\ncentral _to them_—some orb still more unspeakably sublime—some orb, let\nus rather say, of infinite sublimity endlessly multiplied by the\ninfinitely sublime. Such are the conditions, continued in perpetuity,\nwhich the voice of what some people term “analogy” calls upon the Fancy\nto depict and the Reason to contemplate, if possible, without becoming\r\ndissatisfied with the picture. Such, _in general_, are the interminable\ngyrations beyond gyration which we have been instructed by Philosophy to\ncomprehend and to account for, at least in the best manner we can. Now\nand then, however, a philosopher proper—one whose phrenzy takes a very\ndeterminate turn—whose genius, to speak more reverentially, has a\nstrongly-pronounced washerwomanish bias, doing every thing up by the\ndozen—enables us to see _precisely_ that point out of sight, at which\r\nthe revolutionary processes in question do, and of right ought to, come\nto an end.\n\nIt is hardly worth while, perhaps, even to sneer at the reveries of\nFourrier:—but much has been said, latterly, of the hypothesis of\nMädler—that there exists, in the centre of the Galaxy, a stupendous\nglobe about which all the systems of the cluster revolve. The _period_\nof our own, indeed, has been stated—117 millions of years.\n\nThat our Sun has a motion in space, independently of its rotation, and\r\nrevolution about the system’s centre of gravity, has long been\nsuspected. This motion, granting it to exist, would be manifested\nperspectively. The stars in that firmamental region which we were\nleaving behind us, would, in a very long series of years, become\ncrowded; those in the opposite quarter, scattered. Now, by means of\nastronomical History, we ascertain, cloudily, that some such phænomena\nhave occurred. On this ground it has been declared that our system is\nmoving to a point in the heavens diametrically opposite the star Zeta","Herculis:—but this inference is, perhaps, the maximum to which we have\nany logical right. Mädler, however, has gone so far as to designate a\nparticular star, Alcyone in the Pleiades, as being at or about the very\nspot around which a general _revolution_ is performed.\n\nNow, since by “analogy” we are led, in the first instance, to these\ndreams, it is no more than proper that we should abide by analogy, at\nleast in some measure, during their development; and that analogy which\nsuggests the revolution, suggests at the same time a central orb about\r\nwhich it should be performed:—so far the astronomer was consistent. This\ncentral orb, however, should, dynamically, be greater than all the orbs,\ntaken together, which surround it. Of these there are about 100\nmillions. “Why, then,” it was of course demanded, “do we not _see_ this\nvast central sun—_at least equal_ in mass to 100 millions of such suns\nas ours—why do we not _see_ it—_we_, especially, who occupy the mid\nregion of the cluster—the very locality _near_ which, at all events,\r\nmust be situated this incomparable star?” The reply was ready—“It must\nbe non-luminous, as are our planets.” Here, then, to suit a purpose,\nanalogy is suddenly let fall. “Not so,” it may be said—“we know that\nnon-luminous suns actually exist.” It is true that we have reason at\nleast for supposing so; but we have certainly no reason whatever for\nsupposing that the non-luminous suns in question are encircled by\n_luminous_ suns, while these again are surrounded by non-luminous\nplanets:—and it is precisely all this with which Mädler is called upon\r\nto find any thing analogous in the heavens—for it is precisely all this\nwhich he imagines in the case of the Galaxy. Admitting the thing to be\nso, we cannot help here picturing to ourselves how sad a puzzle the _why\nit is so_ must prove to all _à priori_ philosophers.\n\nBut granting, in the very teeth of analogy and of every thing else, the\nnon-luminosity of the vast central orb, we may still inquire how this\norb, so enormous, could fail of being rendered visible by the flood of","light thrown upon it from the 100 millions of glorious suns glaring in\nall directions about it. Upon the urging of this question, the idea of\nan actually solid central sun appears, in some measure, to have been\nabandoned; and speculation proceeded to assert that the systems of the\ncluster perform their revolutions merely about an immaterial centre of\ngravity common to all. Here again then, to suit a purpose, analogy is\nlet fall. The planets of our system revolve, it is true, about a common\ncentre of gravity; but they do this in connexion with, and in\r\nconsequence of, a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the\nrest of the system.\n\nThe mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight\nlines. But this idea of the circle—an idea which, in view of all\nordinary geometry, is merely the mathematical, as contradistinguished\nfrom the practical, idea—is, in sober fact, the _practical_ conception\nwhich alone we have any right to entertain in regard to the majestic\ncircle with which we have to deal, at least in fancy, when we suppose\r\nour system revolving about a point in the centre of the Galaxy. Let the\nmost vigorous of human imaginations attempt but to take a single step\ntowards the comprehension of a sweep so ineffable! It would scarcely be\nparadoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself, travelling\n_forever_ upon the circumference of this unutterable circle, would\nstill, _forever_, be travelling in a straight line. That the path of our\nSun in such an orbit would, to any human perception, deviate in the\r\nslightest degree from a straight line, even in a million of years, is a\nproposition not to be entertained:—yet we are required to believe that a\ncurvature has become apparent during the brief period of our\nastronomical history—during a mere point—during the utter nothingness of\ntwo or three thousand years.\n\nIt may be said that Mädler _has_ really ascertained a curvature in the\ndirection of our system’s now well-established progress through Space.\nAdmitting, if necessary, this fact to be in reality such, I maintain","that nothing is thereby shown except the reality of this fact—the fact\nof a curvature. For its _thorough_ determination, ages will be required;\nand, when determined, it will be found indicative of some binary or\nother multiple relation between our Sun and some one or more of the\nproximate stars. I hazard nothing however, in predicting, that, after\nthe lapse of many centuries, all efforts at determining the path of our\nSun through Space, will be abandoned as fruitless. This is easily\r\nconceivable when we look at the infinity of perturbation it must\nexperience, from its perpetually-shifting relations with other orbs, in\nthe common approach of all to the nucleus of the Galaxy.\n\nBut in examining other “nebulæ” than that of the Milky Way—in surveying,\ngenerally, the clusters which overspread the heavens—do we or do we not\nfind confirmation of Mädler’s hypothesis? We do _not_. The forms of the\nclusters are exceedingly diverse when casually viewed; but on close\ninspection, through powerful telescopes, we recognize the sphere, very\r\ndistinctly, as at least the proximate form of all:—their constitution,\nin general, being at variance with the idea of revolution about a common\ncentre.\n\n“It is difficult,” says Sir John Herschell, “to form any conception of\nthe dynamical state of such systems. On one hand, without a rotary\nmotion and a centrifugal force, it is hardly possible not to regard them\nas in a state of _progressive collapse_. On the other, granting such a\nmotion and such a force, we find it no less difficult to reconcile their\nforms with the rotation of the whole system [meaning cluster] around any\r\nsingle axis, without which internal collision would appear to be\ninevitable.”\n\nSome remarks lately made about the “nebulæ” by Dr. Nichol, in taking\nquite a different view of the cosmical conditions from any taken in this\nDiscourse—have a very peculiar applicability to the point now at issue.\nHe says:\n\n“When our greatest telescopes are brought to bear upon them, we find\nthat those which were thought to be irregular, are not so; they approach\nnearer to a globe. Here is one that looked oval; but Lord Rosse’s","telescope brought it into a circle.... Now there occurs a very\nremarkable circumstance in reference to these comparatively sweeping\ncircular masses of nebulæ. We find they are not entirely circular, but\nthe reverse; and that all around them, on every side, there are volumes\nof stars, _stretching out apparently as if they were rushing towards a\ngreat central mass in consequence of the action of some great\npower_.”[12]\n\n    [12] I must be understood as denying, _especially_, only the\n    _revolutionary_ portion of Mädler’s hypothesis. Of course, if\r\nno great central orb exists _now_ in our cluster, such will\n    exist hereafter. Whenever existing, it will be merely the\n    _nucleus_ of the consolidation.\n\nWere I to describe, in my own words, what must necessarily be the\nexisting condition of each nebula on the hypothesis that all matter is,\nas I suggest, now returning to its original Unity, I should simply be\ngoing over, nearly verbatim, the language here employed by Dr. Nichol,\nwithout the faintest suspicion of that stupendous truth which is the key\r\nto these nebular phænomena.\n\nAnd here let me fortify my position still farther, by the voice of a\ngreater than Mädler—of one, moreover, to whom all the data of Mädler\nhave long been familiar things, carefully and thoroughly considered.\nReferring to the elaborate calculations of Argelander—the very\nresearches which form Mädler’s basis—_Humboldt_, whose generalizing\npowers have never, perhaps been equalled, has the following observation:\n\n“When we regard the real, proper, or non-perspective motions of the\r\nstars, we find _many groups of them moving in opposite directions_; and\nthe data as yet in hand render it not necessary, at least, to conceive\nthat the systems composing the Milky Way, or the clusters, generally,\ncomposing the Universe, are revolving about any particular centre\nunknown, whether luminous or non-luminous. It is but Man’s longing for a\nfundamental First Cause, that impels both his intellect and his fancy\nto the adoption of such an hypothesis.”[13]\n\n    [13] Betrachtet man die nicht perspectivischen eigenen","Bewegungen der Sterne, so scheinen viele gruppenweise in ihrer\n    Richtung entgegengesetzt; und die bisher gesammelten Thatsachen\n    machen es auf’s wenigste nicht nothwendig, anzunehmen, dass\n    alle Theile unserer Sternenschicht oder gar der gesammten\n    Sterneninseln, welche den Weltraum füllen, sich um einen\n    grossen, unbekannten, leuchtenden oder dunkeln Centralkörper\n    bewegen. Das Streben nach den letzten und höchsten\n    Grundursachen macht freilich die reflectirende Thätigkeit des\r\nMenschen, wie seine Phantasie, zu einer solchen Annahme\n    geneigt.\n\nThe phænomenon here alluded to—that of “many groups moving in opposite\ndirections”—is quite inexplicable by Mädler’s idea; but arises, as a\nnecessary consequence, from that which forms the basis of this\nDiscourse. While the _merely general direction_ of each atom—of each\nmoon, planet, star, or cluster—would, on my hypothesis, be, of course,\nabsolutely rectilinear; while the _general_ path of all bodies would be\na right line leading to the centre of all; it is clear, nevertheless,\r\nthat this general rectilinearity would be compounded of what, with\nscarcely any exaggeration, we may term an infinity of particular\ncurves—an infinity of local deviations from rectilinearity—the result of\ncontinuous differences of relative position among the multitudinous\nmasses, as each proceeded on its own proper journey to the End.\n\nI quoted, just now, from Sir John Herschell, the following words, used\nin reference to the clusters:—“On one hand, without a rotary motion and\r\na centrifugal force, it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a\nstate of _progressive collapse_.” The fact is, that, in surveying the\n“nebulæ” with a telescope of high power, we shall find it quite\nimpossible, having once conceived this idea of “collapse,” not to\ngather, at all points, corroboration of the idea. A nucleus is always\napparent, in the direction of which the stars seem to be precipitating\nthemselves; nor can these nuclei be mistaken for merely perspective\nphænomena:—the clusters are _really_ denser near the centre—sparser in","the regions more remote from it. In a word, we see every thing as we\n_should_ see it were a collapse taking place; but, in general, it may be\nsaid of these clusters, that we can fairly entertain, while looking at\nthem, the idea of _orbitual movement about a centre_, only by admitting\nthe _possible_ existence, in the distant domains of space, of dynamical\nlaws with which _we_ are unacquainted.\n\nOn the part of Herschell, however, there is evidently _a reluctance_ to\nregard the nebulæ as in “a state of progressive collapse.” But if\r\nfacts—if even appearances justify the supposition of their being in this\nstate, _why_, it may well be demanded, is he disinclined to admit it?\nSimply on account of a prejudice;—merely because the supposition is at\nwar with a preconceived and utterly baseless notion—that of the\nendlessness—that of the eternal stability of the Universe.\n\nIf the propositions of this Discourse are tenable, the “state of\nprogressive collapse” is _precisely_ that state in which alone we are\nwarranted in considering All Things; and, with due humility, let me here\r\nconfess that, for my part, I am at a loss to conceive how any _other_\nunderstanding of the existing condition of affairs, could ever have made\nits way into the human brain. “The tendency to collapse” and “the\nattraction of gravitation” are convertible phrases. In using either, we\nspeak of the rëaction of the First Act. Never was necessity less obvious\nthan that of supposing Matter imbued with an ineradicable _quality_\nforming part of its material nature—a quality, or instinct, _forever_\r\ninseparable from it, and by dint of which inalienable principle every\natom is _perpetually_ impelled to seek its fellow-atom. Never was\nnecessity less obvious than that of entertaining this unphilosophical\nidea. Going boldly behind the vulgar thought, we have to conceive,\nmetaphysically, that the gravitating principle appertains to Matter\n_temporarily_—only while diffused—only while existing as Many instead of\nas One—appertains to it by virtue of its state of irradiation\nalone—appertains, in a word, altogether to its _condition_, and not in","the slightest degree to _itself_. In this view, when the irradiation\nshall have returned into its source—when the rëaction shall be\ncompleted—the gravitating principle will no longer exist. And, in fact,\nastronomers, without at any time reaching the idea here suggested, seem\nto have been approximating it, in the assertion that “if there were but\none body in the Universe, it would be impossible to understand how the\nprinciple, Gravity, could obtain:”—that is to say, from a consideration\r\nof Matter as they find it, they reach a conclusion at which I\ndeductively arrive. That so pregnant a suggestion as the one just quoted\nshould have been permitted to remain so long unfruitful, is,\nnevertheless, a mystery which I find it difficult to fathom.\n\nIt is, perhaps, in no little degree, however, our propensity for the\ncontinuous—for the analogical—in the present case more particularly for\nthe symmetrical—which has been leading us astray. And, in fact, the\nsense of the symmetrical is an instinct which may be depended upon with\r\nan almost blindfold reliance. It is the poetical essence of the\nUniverse—_of the Universe_ which, in the supremeness of its symmetry, is\nbut the most sublime of poems. Now symmetry and consistency are\nconvertible terms:—thus Poetry and Truth are one. A thing is consistent\nin the ratio of its truth—true in the ratio of its consistency. _A\nperfect consistency, I repeat, can be nothing but an absolute truth._ We\nmay take it for granted, then, that Man cannot long or widely err, if he\r\nsuffer himself to be guided by his poetical, which I have maintained to\nbe his truthful, in being his symmetrical, instinct. He must have a\ncare, however, lest, in pursuing too heedlessly the superficial symmetry\nof forms and motions, he leave out of sight the really essential\nsymmetry of the principles which determine and control them.\n\nThat the stellar bodies would finally be merged in one—that, at last,\nall would be drawn into the substance of _one stupendous central orb\nalready existing_—is an idea which, for some time past, seems, vaguely","and indeterminately, to have held possession of the fancy of mankind. It\nis an idea, in fact, which belongs to the class of the _excessively\nobvious_. It springs, instantly, from a superficial observation of the\ncyclic and seemingly _gyrating_, or _vorticial_ movements of those\nindividual portions of the Universe which come most immediately and most\nclosely under our observation. There is not, perhaps, a human being, of\nordinary education and of average reflective capacity, to whom, at some\r\nperiod, the fancy in question has not occurred, as if spontaneously, or\nintuitively, and wearing all the character of a very profound and very\noriginal conception. This conception, however, so commonly entertained,\nhas never, within my knowledge, arisen out of any abstract\nconsiderations. Being, on the contrary, always suggested, as I say, by\nthe vorticial movements about centres, a reason for it, also,—a _cause_\nfor the ingathering of all the orbs into one, _imagined to be already\nexisting_, was naturally sought in the same direction—among these cyclic\r\nmovements themselves.\n\nThus it happened that, on announcement of the gradual and perfectly\nregular decrease observed in the orbit of Enck’s comet, at every\nsuccessive revolution about our Sun, astronomers were nearly unanimous\nin the opinion that the cause in question was found—that a principle was\ndiscovered sufficient to account, physically, for that final, universal\nagglomeration which, I repeat, the analogical, symmetrical or poetical\ninstinct of Man had predetermined to understand as something more than a\r\nsimple hypothesis.\n\nThis cause—this sufficient reason for the final ingathering—was declared\nto exist in an exceedingly rare but still material medium pervading\nspace; which medium, by retarding, in some degree, the progress of the\ncomet, perpetually weakened its tangential force; thus giving a\npredominance to the centripetal; which, of course, drew the comet nearer\nand nearer at each revolution, and would eventually precipitate it upon\nthe Sun.\n\nAll this was strictly logical—admitting the medium or ether; but this","ether was assumed, most illogically, on the ground that no _other_ mode\nthan the one spoken of could be discovered, of accounting for the\nobserved decrease in the orbit of the comet:—as if from the fact that we\ncould _discover_ no other mode of accounting for it, it followed, in any\nrespect, that no other mode of accounting for it existed. It is clear\nthat innumerable causes might operate, in combination, to diminish the\norbit, without even a possibility of our ever becoming acquainted with\r\none of them. In the meantime, it has never been fairly shown, perhaps,\nwhy the retardation occasioned by the skirts of the Sun’s atmosphere,\nthrough which the comet passes at perihelion, is not enough to account\nfor the phænomenon. That Enck’s comet will be absorbed into the Sun, is\nprobable; that all the comets of the system will be absorbed, is more\nthan merely possible; but, in such case, the principle of absorption\nmust be referred to eccentricity of orbit—to the close approximation to\nthe Sun, of the comets at their perihelia; and is a principle not\r\naffecting, in any degree, the ponderous _spheres_, which are to be\nregarded as the true material constituents of the Universe.—Touching\ncomets, in general, let me here suggest, in passing, that we cannot be\nfar wrong in looking upon them as the _lightning-flashes of the cosmical\nHeaven_.\n\nThe idea of a retarding ether and, through it, of a final agglomeration\nof all things, seemed at one time, however, to be confirmed by the\nobservation of a positive decrease in the orbit of the solid moon. By\r\nreference to eclipses recorded 2500 years ago, it was found that the\nvelocity of the satellite’s revolution _then_ was considerably less than\nit is _now_; that on the hypothesis that its motions in its orbit is\nuniformly in accordance with Kepler’s law, and was accurately determined\n_then_—2500 years ago—it is now in advance of the position it _should_\noccupy, by nearly 9000 miles. The increase of velocity proved, of\ncourse, a diminution of orbit; and astronomers were fast yielding to a\nbelief in an ether, as the sole mode of accounting for the phænomenon,","when Lagrange came to the rescue. He showed that, owing to the\nconfigurations of the spheroids, the shorter axes of their ellipses are\nsubject to variation in length; the longer axes being permanent; and\nthat this variation is continuous and vibratory—so that every orbit is\nin a state of transition, either from circle to ellipse, or from ellipse\nto circle. In the case of the moon, where the shorter axis is\n_de_creasing, the orbit is passing from circle to ellipse and,\nconsequently, is _de_creasing too; but, after a long series of ages, the\r\nultimate eccentricity will be attained; then the shorter axis will\nproceed to _in_crease, until the orbit becomes a circle; when the\nprocess of shortening will again take place;—and so on forever. In the\ncase of the Earth, the orbit is passing from ellipse to circle. The\nfacts thus demonstrated do away, of course, with all necessity for\nsupposing an ether, and with all apprehension of the system’s\ninstability—on the ether’s account.\n\nIt will be remembered that I have myself assumed what we may term _an\r\nether_. I have spoken of a subtle _influence_ which we know to be ever\nin attendance upon matter, although becoming manifest only through\nmatter’s heterogeneity. To this _influence_—without daring to touch it\nat all in any effort at explaining its awful _nature_—I have referred\nthe various phænomena of electricity, heat, light, magnetism; and\nmore—of vitality, consciousness, and thought—in a word, of spirituality.\nIt will be seen, at once, then, that the ether thus conceived is\nradically distinct from the ether of the astronomers; inasmuch as theirs\r\nis _matter_ and mine _not_.\n\nWith the idea of a material ether, seems, thus, to have departed\naltogether the thought of that universal agglomeration so long\npredetermined by the poetical fancy of mankind:—an agglomeration in\nwhich a sound Philosophy might have been warranted in putting faith, at\nleast to a certain extent, if for no other reason than that by this\npoetical fancy it _had_ been so predetermined. But so far as\nAstronomy—so far as mere Physics have yet spoken, the cycles of the","Universe are perpetual—the Universe has no conceivable end. Had an end\nbeen demonstrated, however, from so purely collateral a cause as an\nether, Man’s instinct of the Divine _capacity to adapt_, would have\nrebelled against the demonstration. We should have been forced to regard\nthe Universe with some such sense of dissatisfaction as we experience in\ncontemplating an unnecessarily complex work of human art. Creation would\nhave affected us as an imperfect _plot_ in a romance, where the\r\n_dénoûment_ is awkwardly brought about by interposed incidents external\nand foreign to the main subject; instead of springing out of the bosom\nof the thesis—out of the heart of the ruling idea—instead of arising as\na result of the primary proposition—as inseparable and inevitable part\nand parcel of the fundamental conception of the book.\n\nWhat I mean by the symmetry of mere surface will now be more clearly\nunderstood. It is simply by the blandishment of this symmetry that we\nhave been beguiled into the general idea of which Mädler’s hypothesis is\r\nbut a part—the idea of the vorticial indrawing of the orbs. Dismissing\nthis nakedly physical conception, the symmetry of principle sees the end\nof all things metaphysically involved in the thought of a beginning;\nseeks and finds in this origin of all things the _rudiment_ of this end;\nand perceives the impiety of supposing this end likely to be brought\nabout less simply—less directly—less obviously—less artistically—than\nthrough _the rëaction of the originating Act_.\n\nRecurring, then, to a previous suggestion, let us understand the\r\nsystems—let us understand each star, with its attendant planets—as but a\nTitanic atom existing in space with precisely the same inclination for\nUnity which characterized, in the beginning, the actual atoms after\ntheir irradiation throughout the Universal sphere. As these original\natoms rushed towards each other in generally straight lines, so let us\nconceive as at least generally rectilinear, the paths of the\nsystem-atoms towards their respective centres of aggregation:—and in","this direct drawing together of the systems into clusters, with a\nsimilar and simultaneous drawing together of the clusters themselves\nwhile undergoing consolidation, we have at length attained the great\n_Now_—the awful Present—the Existing Condition of the Universe.\n\nOf the still more awful Future a not irrational analogy may guide us in\nframing an hypothesis. The equilibrium between the centripetal and\ncentrifugal forces of each system, being necessarily destroyed upon\nattainment of a certain proximity to the nucleus of the cluster to which\r\nit belongs, there must occur, at once, a chaotic or seemingly chaotic\nprecipitation, of the moons upon the planets, of the planets upon the\nsuns, and of the suns upon the nuclei; and the general result of this\nprecipitation must be the gathering of the myriad now-existing stars of\nthe firmament into an almost infinitely less number of almost infinitely\nsuperior spheres. In being immeasurably fewer, the worlds of that day\nwill be immeasurably greater than our own. Then, indeed, amid\r\nunfathomable abysses, will be glaring unimaginable suns. But all this\nwill be merely a climacic magnificence foreboding the great End. Of this\nEnd the new genesis described, can be but a very partial postponement.\nWhile undergoing consolidation, the clusters themselves, with a speed\nprodigiously accumulative, have been rushing towards their own general\ncentre—and now, with a thousand-fold electric velocity, commensurate\nonly with their material grandeur and with the spiritual passion of\r\ntheir appetite for oneness, the majestic remnants of the tribe of Stars\nflash, at length, into a common embrace. The inevitable catastrophe is\nat hand.\n\nBut this catastrophe—what is it? We have seen accomplished the\ningathering of the orbs. Henceforward, are we not to understand _one\nmaterial globe of globes_ as constituting and comprehending the\nUniverse? Such a fancy would be altogether at war with every assumption\nand consideration of this Discourse.\n\nI have already alluded to that absolute _reciprocity of adaptation_","which is the idiosyncrasy of the divine Art—stamping it divine. Up to\nthis point of our reflections, we have been regarding the electrical\ninfluence as a something by dint of whose repulsion alone Matter is\nenabled to exist in that state of diffusion demanded for the fulfilment\nof its purposes:—so far, in a word, we have been considering the\ninfluence in question as ordained for Matter’s sake—to subserve the\nobjects of matter. With a perfectly legitimate reciprocity, we are now\npermitted to look at Matter, as created _solely for the sake of this\r\ninfluence_—solely to serve the objects of this spiritual Ether. Through\nthe aid—by the means—through the agency of Matter, and by dint of its\nheterogeneity—is this Ether manifested—is _Spirit individualized_. It is\nmerely in the development of this Ether, through heterogeneity, that\nparticular masses of Matter become animate—sensitive—and in the ratio of\ntheir heterogeneity;—some reaching a degree of sensitiveness involving\nwhat we call _Thought_ and thus attaining Conscious Intelligence.\r\nIn this view, we are enabled to perceive Matter as a Means—not as an\nEnd. Its purposes are thus seen to have been comprehended in its\ndiffusion; and with the return into Unity these purposes cease. The\nabsolutely consolidated globe of globes would be _objectless_:—therefore\nnot for a moment could it continue to exist. Matter, created for an end,\nwould unquestionably, on fulfilment of that end, be Matter no longer.\nLet us endeavor to understand that it would disappear, and that God\nwould remain all in all.\r\nThat every work of Divine conception must cöexist and cöexpire with its\nparticular design, seems to me especially obvious; and I make no doubt\nthat, on perceiving the final globe of globes to be _objectless_, the\nmajority of my readers will be satisfied with my “_therefore_ it cannot\ncontinue to exist.” Nevertheless, as the startling thought of its\ninstantaneous disappearance is one which the most powerful intellect\ncannot be expected readily to entertain on grounds so decidedly\nabstract, let us endeavor to look at the idea from some other and more","ordinary point of view:—let us see how thoroughly and beautifully it is\ncorroborated in an _à posteriori_ consideration of Matter as we actually\nfind it.\n\nI have before said that “Attraction and Repulsion being undeniably the\nsole properties by which Matter is manifested to Mind, we are justified\nin assuming that Matter _exists_ only as Attraction and Repulsion—in\nother words that Attraction and Repulsion _are_ Matter; there being no\nconceivable case in which we may not employ the term Matter and the\r\nterms ‘Attraction’ and ‘Repulsion’ taken together, as equivalent, and\ntherefore convertible, expressions in Logic.”[14]\n\n    [14] Page 37.\n\nNow the very definition of Attraction implies particularity—the\nexistence of parts, particles, or atoms; for we define it as the\ntendency of “each atom &c. to every other atom” &c. according to a\ncertain law. Of course where there are _no_ parts—where there is\nabsolute Unity—where the tendency to oneness is satisfied—there can be\nno Attraction:—this has been fully shown, and all Philosophy admits it.\r\nWhen, on fulfilment of its purposes, then, Matter shall have returned\ninto its original condition of _One_—a condition which presupposes the\nexpulsion of the separative ether, whose province and whose capacity are\nlimited to keeping the atoms apart until that great day when, this ether\nbeing no longer needed, the overwhelming pressure of the finally\ncollective Attraction shall at length just sufficiently predominate[15]\nand expel it:—when, I say, Matter, finally, expelling the Ether, shall\r\nhave returned into absolute Unity,—it will then (to speak paradoxically\nfor the moment) be Matter without Attraction and without Repulsion—in\nother words, Matter without Matter—in other words, again, _Matter no\nmore_. In sinking into Unity, it will sink at once into that Nothingness\nwhich, to all Finite Perception, Unity must be—into that Material\nNihility from which alone we can conceive it to have been evoked—to have\nbeen _created_ by the Volition of God.\n\n    [15] “Gravity, therefore, must be the strongest of forces.”—See\n    page 39.","I repeat then—Let us endeavor to comprehend that the final globe of\nglobes will instantaneously disappear, and that God will remain all in\nall.\n\nBut are we here to pause? Not so. On the Universal agglomeration and\ndissolution, we can readily conceive that a new and perhaps totally\ndifferent series of conditions may ensue—another creation and\nirradiation, returning into itself—another action and rëaction of the\nDivine Will. Guiding our imaginations by that omniprevalent law of laws,\r\nthe law of periodicity, are we not, indeed, more than justified in\nentertaining a belief—let us say, rather, in indulging a hope—that the\nprocesses we have here ventured to contemplate will be renewed forever,\nand forever, and forever; a novel Universe swelling into existence, and\nthen subsiding into nothingness, at every throb of the Heart Divine?\n\nAnd now—this Heart Divine—what is it? _It is our own._\n\nLet not the merely seeming irreverence of this idea frighten our souls\nfrom that cool exercise of consciousness—from that deep tranquillity of\r\nself-inspection—through which alone we can hope to attain the presence\nof this, the most sublime of truths, and look it leisurely in the face.\n\nThe _phænomena_ on which our conclusions must at this point depend, are\nmerely spiritual shadows, but not the less thoroughly substantial.\n\nWe walk about, amid the destinies of our world-existence, encompassed by\ndim but ever present _Memories_ of a Destiny more vast—very distant in\nthe by-gone time, and infinitely awful.\n\nWe live out a Youth peculiarly haunted by such dreams; yet never\r\nmistaking them for dreams. As Memories we _know_ them. _During our\nYouth_ the distinction is too clear to deceive us even for a moment.\n\nSo long as this Youth endures, the feeling _that we exist_, is the most\nnatural of all feelings. We understand it _thoroughly_. That there was a\nperiod at which we did _not_ exist—or, that it might so have happened\nthat we never had existed at all—are the considerations, indeed, which\n_during this youth_, we find difficulty in understanding. Why we should\n_not_ exist, is, _up to the epoch of our Manhood_, of all queries the most","unanswerable. Existence—self-existence—existence from all Time and to\nall Eternity—seems, up to the epoch of Manhood, a normal and\nunquestionable condition:—_seems, because it is_.\n\nBut now comes the period at which a conventional World-Reason awakens us\nfrom the truth of our dream. Doubt, Surprise and Incomprehensibility\narrive at the same moment. They say:—“You live and the time was when you\nlived not. You have been created. An Intelligence exists greater than\nyour own; and it is only through this Intelligence you live at all.”\r\nThese things we struggle to comprehend and cannot:—_cannot_, because\nthese things, being untrue, are thus, of necessity, incomprehensible.\n\nNo thinking being lives who, at some luminous point of his life of\nthought, has not felt himself lost amid the surges of futile efforts at\nunderstanding, or believing, that anything exists _greater than his own\nsoul_. The utter impossibility of any one’s soul feeling itself inferior\nto another; the intense, overwhelming dissatisfaction and rebellion at\r\nthe thought;—these, with the omniprevalent aspirations at perfection,\nare but the spiritual, coincident with the material, struggles towards\nthe original Unity—are, to my mind at least, a species of proof far\nsurpassing what Man terms demonstration, that no one soul _is_ inferior\nto another—that nothing is, or can be, superior to any one soul—that\neach soul is, in part, its own God—its own Creator:—in a word, that\nGod—the material _and_ spiritual God—_now_ exists solely in the diffused\nMatter and Spirit of the Universe; and that the regathering of this\r\ndiffused Matter and Spirit will be but the re-constitution of the\n_purely_ Spiritual and Individual God.\n\nIn this view, and in this view alone, we comprehend the riddles of\nDivine Injustice—of Inexorable Fate. In this view alone the existence of\nEvil becomes intelligible; but in this view it becomes more—it becomes\nendurable. Our souls no longer rebel at a _Sorrow_ which we ourselves\nhave imposed upon ourselves, in furtherance of our own purposes—with a\nview—if even with a futile view—to the extension of our own _Joy_.","I have spoken of _Memories_ that haunt us during our youth. They\nsometimes pursue us even in our Manhood:—assume gradually less and less\nindefinite shapes:—now and then speak to us with low voices, saying:\n\n“There was an epoch in the Night of Time, when a still-existent Being\nexisted—one of an absolutely infinite number of similar Beings that\npeople the absolutely infinite domains of the absolutely infinite\nspace.[16] It was not and is not in the power of this Being—any more\r\nthan it is in your own—to extend, by actual increase, the joy of his\nExistence; but just as it _is_ in your power to expand or to concentrate\nyour pleasures (the absolute amount of happiness remaining always the\nsame) so did and does a similar capability appertain to this Divine\nBeing, who thus passes his Eternity in perpetual variation of\nConcentrated Self and almost Infinite Self-Diffusion. What you call The\nUniverse is but his present expansive existence. He now feels his life\nthrough an infinity of imperfect pleasures—the partial and\r\npain-intertangled pleasures of those inconceivably numerous things which\nyou designate as his creatures, but which are really but infinite\nindividualizations of Himself. All these creatures—_all_—those which you\nterm animate, as well as those to whom you deny life for no better\nreason than that you do not behold it in operation—_all_ these creatures\nhave, in a greater or less degree, a capacity for pleasure and for\npain:—_but the general sum of their sensations is precisely that amount\r\nof Happiness which appertains by right to the Divine Being when\nconcentrated within Himself_. These creatures are all, too, more or less\nconscious Intelligences; conscious, first, of a proper identity;\nconscious, secondly and by faint indeterminate glimpses, of an identity\nwith the Divine Being of whom we speak—of an identity with God. Of the\ntwo classes of consciousness, fancy that the former will grow weaker,\nthe latter stronger, during the long succession of ages which must\nelapse before these myriads of individual Intelligences become","blended—when the bright stars become blended—into One. Think that the\nsense of individual identity will be gradually merged in the general\nconsciousness—that Man, for example, ceasing imperceptibly to feel\nhimself Man, will at length attain that awfully triumphant epoch when he\nshall recognize his existence as that of Jehovah. In the meantime bear\nin mind that all is Life—Life—Life within Life—the less within the\ngreater, and all within the _Spirit Divine_.”\n\n    [16] See pages 102-103—Paragraph commencing “I reply that the\r\nright,” and ending “proper and particular God.”\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n155 Broadway, NEW YORK. 142 Strand, LONDON.\n\nOf late firm of WILEY & PUTNAM.\n\n\nNew Works in Press,\n\nOr recently published, by\n\nGEORGE P.

This edition will be printed on paper of the finest\nquality, similar in size and style to the new edition of “Halleck’s\nPoems.” It is intended that the illustrations shall be superior to any\nengravings on wood yet produced in this country, and that the mechanical\r\nexecution of the volume, altogether, shall be worthy of the author’s\nreputation. It will form an elegant and appropriate gift-book for all\nseasons.\n\n\nThe Illustrated Knickerbocker,\n\nWith a series of Original Designs, in one vol., octavo, is also in\npreparation.\n\n\nMr. Putnam has also the honor to announce that he will publish at\nintervals (in connexion, and uniform with the other collected writings),\n\n_Mr. Irving’s New Works_,\n\nnow nearly ready for the press: including\n\nThe Life of Mohammed; The Life of Washington; new volumes of\r\nMiscellanies, Biographies, &c.\n\n    ⁂ This being the first uniform and complete edition of Mr.\n    Irving’s works, either in this country or in Europe, the\n    publisher confidently believes that the undertaking will meet\n    with a prompt and cordial response. To say this, is perhaps\n    superfluous and impertinent; for it is a truism that no\n    _American_ book-case (not to say _library_) can be well filled\n    without the works of Washington Irving; while the English\n    language itself comprises no purer models of composition.\r\nG.

By Louis F. Klipstein, AA.LL.M.\nand PH.D., of the University of Giessen.\n\n    ⁂ This work recommends itself particularly to the attention of\n    every American student who “glories in his Anglo-Saxon descent”\n    or Teutonic lineage, as well as of all who desire an\r\nacquaintance with a language which lies as the foundation of\n    the English, and throws a light upon its elements and\n    structure, derivable from no other source. Of the importance\n    and interesting nature of the study there can be no doubt, and\n    we agree with those who think that the time is coming when it\n    will be considered “utterly disgraceful for any well-bred\n    Englishman or American” to have neglected it. With regard to\n    the merits of Dr. Klipstein’s Grammar, we will only say, that\r\nit has been already adopted as a text-book in some of the\n    leading Institutions of our country.\n\n[The following are also in press.]\n\nII.\n\nAnalecta Anglo-Saxonica, with an Introductory Ethnographical Essay,\nCopious Notes, Critical and Explanatory, and a Glossary in which are\nshown the Indo-Germanic and other Affinities of the Language. _By the\nsame._\n\nIn this work appear the fruits of considerable research, and, we may\nadd, learning. The Ethnology of Europe is succinctly, but clearly\nillustrated, the Anglo-Saxon language completely analysed, revealing the\r\nutmost harmony of combination from its elements, its forms and roots\ncompared with those in kindred dialects and cognate tongues, its\nposition in the Teutonic family and Indo-Germanic range established, and\nthe genuine relation of the English to its great parent properly set\nforth. To those who are fond of the comparative study of language, the\nGlossary will prove an invaluable aid, apart from its particular object.\n\nIII.\n\nNatale Sancti Gregorii Papæ.—Ælfric’s Homily on the Birth-day of St.","Gregory, and Collateral Extracts from King Alfred’s version of Bede’s\nEcclesiastical History and the Saxon Chronicle, with a full rendering\ninto English, Notes Critical and Explanatory, and an Index of Words. _By\nthe same._\n\nIV.\n\nExtracts from the Anglo-Saxon-Gospels, a Portion of the Anglo-Saxon\nParaphrase of the Book of Psalms, and other Selections of a Sacred Order\nin the same Language, with a Translation into English, and Notes\nCritical and Explanatory. _By the same._\n\nThese two works are prepared in such a way as in themselves, with the\r\naid of the Grammar, to afford every facility to the Anglo-Saxon Student.\nÆlfric’s Homily is remarkable for beauty of composition, and interesting\nas setting forth Augustine’s Mission to the “Land of the Angles.”\n\nV.\n\nTha Halgan Godspel on Englisc—the Anglo-Saxon Version of the Holy\nGospels. Edited by Benjamin Thorpe, F.S.A. _Reprinted by the same. Now\nready._\n\nThis, the earliest “English” version of the Four Gospels, will be found\ninteresting to the antiquarian and theologian, as well as serviceable to\r\nthe student in his investigations of the language. The Text, besides the\nusual but unbroken division, appears, with the Rubrics, as read in the\nearly Anglican Church.\n\n\n_Nearly Ready._\n\nDr. Bosworth’s Compendious Anglo-Saxon Dictionary. Small 8vo.\n\nVII.\n\nStudy of Modern Languages.\n\nPart First; French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and English.\n\nBy L. F. Klipstein, AA.LL.M. and Ph.D. One Vol. Imperial 8vo. 75 cents\npaper; $1 00 cloth.\n\nThis work, which is intended equally for the simultaneous and the\r\nseparate study of the languages that it sets forth, and which is adapted\nas well for the native of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, or Portugal, as\nfor him to whom English is vernacular, in the acquirement of any one of\nthe other tongues besides his own, will be found an acceptable manual\nnot only to the tyro, but to the more advanced scholar. The reading\nportion of the matter is interesting, and the text in every case\nremarkably correct, while the Elementary Phrases, forms of Cards,\nLetters, Bills of Exchange, Promissory Notes, Receipts, &c., in the six","languages, constitute what has long been a desideratum from the American\npress. For the comparative study of the _Romanic_ tongues the work\naffords unusual facilities.\n\nVIII.\n\nPedestrian Tour in Europe.\n\nViews a-Foot; or Europe seen with Knapsack and Staff.\n\nBy J.

Cloth.\n\n    “The result of sixteen years of untiring labor. The different\n    editions of Shakspeare have been carefully collated by the\n    compiler, and every possible means taken to insure the\n    correctness of the work. As it now stands, a person can find a\r\nparticular passage in Shakspeare by simply remembering one word\n    of it, and is also referred to the act and scene of the play in\n    which it occurs. As a mere dictionary of Shakspearian language\n    and phrases, it is of great value; but it is also a dictionary\n    of his thoughts and imaginations.

p\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neureka\r\n\r\nan essay on the material and spiritual universe\r\n\r\n\r\nit is with humility really unassumedit is with a sentiment even of\r\nawethat i pen the opening sentence of this work for of all conceivable\r\nsubjects i approach the reader with the most solemnthe most\r\ncomprehensivethe most difficultthe most august\r\n\r\nwhat terms shall i find sufficiently simple in their\r\nsublimitysufficiently sublime in their simplicityfor the mere\r\nenunciation of my theme\r\n\r\ni design to speak of the physical metaphysical and mathematicalof the\r\nmaterial and spiritual universeof its essence its origin its\r\ncreation its present condition and its destiny i shall be so rash\r\nmoreover as to challenge the conclusions and thus in effect to\r\nquestion the sagacity of many of the greatest and most justly\r\nreverenced of men\r\n\r\nin the beginning let me as distinctly as possible announcenot the\r\ntheorem which i hope to demonstratefor whatever the mathematicians may\r\nassert there is in this world at least no such thing as\r\ndemonstrationbut the ruling idea which throughout this volume i shall\r\nbe continually endeavoring to suggest\r\n\r\nmy general proposition then is thisin the original unity of the\r\nfirst thing lies the secondary cause of all things with the germ of\r\ntheir inevitable annihilation\r\n\r\nin illustration of this idea i propose to take such a survey of the\r\nuniverse that the mind may be able really to receive and to perceive an\r\nindividual impression\r\n\r\nhe who from the top of ætna casts his eyes leisurely around is affected\r\nchiefly by the extent and diversity of the scene only by a rapid\r\nwhirling on his heel could he hope to comprehend the panorama in the\r\nsublimity of its oneness but as on the summit of ætna no man has\r\nthought of whirling on his heel so no man has ever taken into his brain\r\nthe full uniqueness of the prospect and so again whatever\r\nconsiderations lie involved in this uniqueness have as yet no practical\r\nexistence for mankind\r\n\r\ni do not know a treatise in which a survey of the universeusing the\r\nword in its most comprehensive and only legitimate acceptationis taken\r\nat alland it may be as well here to mention that by the term\r\nuniverse wherever employed without qualification in this essay i\r\nmean to designate the utmost conceivable expanse of space with all\r\nthings spiritual and material that can be imagined to exist within the\r\ncompass of that expanse in speaking of what is ordinarily implied by\r\nthe expression universe i shall take a phrase of limitationthe\r\nuniverse of stars why this distinction is considered necessary will\r\nbe seen in the sequel\r\n\r\nbut even of treatises on the really limited although always assumed as\r\nthe unlimited universe of stars i know none in which a survey\r\neven of this limited universe is so taken as to warrant deductions from\r\nits individuality the nearest approach to such a work is made in the\r\ncosmos of alexander von humboldt he presents the subject however\r\nnot in its individuality but in its generality his theme in its last\r\nresult is the law of each portion of the merely physical universe as\r\nthis law is related to the laws of every other portion of this merely\r\nphysical universe his design is simply synœretical in a word he\r\ndiscusses the universality of material relation and discloses to the\r\neye of philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden behind\r\nthis universality but however admirable be the succinctness with which\r\nhe has treated each particular point of his topic the mere multiplicity\r\nof these points occasions necessarily an amount of detail and thus an\r\ninvolution of idea which precludes all individuality of impression\r\n\r\nit seems to me that in aiming at this latter effect and through it\r\nat the consequencesthe conclusionsthe suggestionsthe speculationsor\r\nif nothing better offer itself the mere guesses which may result from\r\nitwe require something like a mental gyration on the heel we need so\r\nrapid a revolution of all things about the central point of sight that\r\nwhile the minutiæ vanish altogether even the more conspicuous objects\r\nbecome blended into one among the vanishing minutiæ in a survey of\r\nthis kind would be all exclusively terrestrial matters the earth would\r\nbe considered in its planetary relations alone a man in this view\r\nbecomes mankind mankind a member of the cosmical family of\r\nintelligences\r\n\r\nand now before proceeding to our subject proper let me beg the\r\nreaders attention to an extract or two from a somewhat remarkable\r\nletter which appears to have been found corked in a bottle and floating\r\non the mare tenebraruman ocean well described by the nubian\r\ngeographer ptolemy hephestion but little frequented in modern days\r\nunless by the transcendentalists and some other divers for crotchets\r\nthe date of this letter i confess surprises me even more particularly\r\nthan its contents for it seems to have been written in the year two\r\nthousand eight hundred and fortyeight as for the passages i am about\r\nto transcribe they i fancy will speak for themselves\r\n\r\ndo you know my dear friend says the writer addressing no doubt a\r\ncontemporarydo you know that it is scarcely more than eight or nine\r\nhundred years ago since the metaphysicians first consented to relieve\r\nthe people of the singular fancy that there exist but two practicable\r\nroads to truth believe it if you can it appears however that long\r\nlong ago in the night of time there lived a turkish philosopher called\r\naries and surnamed tottle here possibly the letterwriter means\r\naristotle the best names are wretchedly corrupted in two or three\r\nthousand years the fame of this great man depended mainly upon his\r\ndemonstration that sneezing is a natural provision by means of which\r\noverprofound thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous ideas through\r\nthe nose but he obtained a scarcely less valuable celebrity as the\r\nfounder or at all events as the principal propagator of what was\r\ntermed the deductive or à priori philosophy he started with what he\r\nmaintained to be axioms or selfevident truthsand the now well\r\nunderstood fact that no truths are selfevident really does not\r\nmake in the slightest degree against his speculationsit was sufficient\r\nfor his purpose that the truths in question were evident at all from\r\naxioms he proceeded logically to results his most illustrious\r\ndisciples were one tuclid a geometrician meaning euclid and one\r\nkant a dutchman the originator of that species of transcendentalism\r\nwhich with the change merely of a c for a k now bears his peculiar\r\nname\r\n\r\nwell aries tottle flourished supreme until the advent of one hog\r\nsurnamed the ettrick shepherd who preached an entirely different\r\nsystem which he called the à posteriori or inductive his plan\r\nreferred altogether to sensation he proceeded by observing analyzing\r\nand classifying factsinstantiæ naturæ as they were somewhat\r\naffectedly calledand arranging them into general laws in a word while\r\nthe mode of aries rested on noumena that of hog depended on\r\nphenomena and so great was the admiration excited by this latter\r\nsystem that at its first introduction aries fell into general\r\ndisrepute finally however he recovered ground and was permitted to\r\ndivide the empire of philosophy with his more modern rivalthe savans\r\ncontenting themselves with proscribing all other competitors past\r\npresent and to come putting an end to all controversy on the topic by\r\nthe promulgation of a median law to the effect that the aristotelian\r\nand baconian roads are and of right ought to be the solo possible\r\navenues to knowledgebaconian you must know my dear friend adds\r\nthe letterwriter at this point was an adjective invented as\r\nequivalent to hogian and at the same time more dignified and\r\neuphonious\r\n\r\nnow i do assure you most positivelyproceeds the epistlethat i\r\nrepresent these matters fairly and you can easily understand how\r\nrestrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated in those\r\ndays to retard the progress of true science which makes its most\r\nimportant advancesas all history will showby seemingly intuitive\r\nleaps these ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling and i\r\nneed not suggest to you that crawling among varieties of locomotion is\r\na very capital thing of its kindbut because the tortoise is sure of\r\nfoot for this reason must we clip the wings of the eagles for many\r\ncenturies so great was the infatuation about hog especially that a\r\nvirtual stop was put to all thinking properly so called no man dared\r\nutter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone it\r\nmattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably such for the\r\ndogmatizing philosophers of that epoch regarded only the road by which\r\nit professed to have been attained the end with them was a point of\r\nno moment whateverthe means they vociferatedlet us look at the\r\nmeansand if on scrutiny of the means it was found to come neither\r\nunder the category hog nor under the category aries which means ram\r\nwhy then the savans went no farther but calling the thinker a fool\r\nand branding him a theorist would never thenceforward have any\r\nthing to do either with him or with his truths\r\n\r\nnow my dear friend continues the letterwriter it cannot be\r\nmaintained that by the crawling system exclusively adopted men would\r\narrive at the maximum amount of truth even in any long series of ages\r\nfor the repression of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced\r\neven by absolute certainty in the snail processes but their certainty\r\nwas very far from absolute the error of our progenitors was quite\r\nanalogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies he must necessarily see\r\nan object the more distinctly the more closely he holds it to his eyes\r\nthey blinded themselves too with the impalpable titillating scotch\r\nsnuff of detail and thus the boasted facts of the hogites were by

all attempts at\r\ngeneralization were met at once by the words theoretical theory\r\ntheoristall thought to be brief was very properly resented as a\r\npersonal affront to themselves cultivating the

miserably ignorant in view of\r\nall the comprehensible objects of knowledge than the veriest unlettered\r\nhind who proves that he knows something at least in admitting that he\r\nknows absolutely nothing\r\n\r\nnor had our forefathers any better right to talk about certainty\r\nwhen pursuing in blind confidence the à priori path of axioms or of\r\nthe ram at innumerable points this path was scarcely as straight as a\r\nramshorn the simple truth is that the aristotelians erected their\r\ncastles upon a basis far less reliable than air for no such things as\r\naxioms ever existed or can possibly exist at all this they must have\r\nbeen very blind indeed not to see or at least to suspect for even\r\nin their own day many of their longadmitted axioms had been\r\nabandonedex nihilo nihil fit for example and a thing cannot act\r\nwhere it is not and there cannot be antipodes and darkness cannot\r\nproceed from light these and numerous similar propositions formerly\r\naccepted without hesitation as axioms or undeniable truths were\r\neven at the period of which i speak seen to be altogether\r\nuntenablehow absurd in these people then to persist in relying upon\r\na basis as immutable whose mutability had become so repeatedly\r\nmanifest\r\n\r\nbut even through evidence afforded by themselves against themselves\r\nit is easy to convict these à priori reasoners of the grossest\r\nunreasonit is easy to show the futilitythe impalpability of their\r\naxioms in general i have now lying before meit will be observed that\r\nwe still proceed with the letteri have now lying before me a book\r\nprinted about a thousand years ago pundit assures me that it is\r\ndecidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic which is logic the\r\nauthor who was much esteemed in his day was one miller or mill and\r\nwe find it recorded of him as a point of some importance that he rode\r\na millhorse whom he called jeremy benthambut let us glance at the\r\nvolume itself\r\n\r\nahability or inability to conceive says mr mill very properly\r\nis in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth now\r\nthat this is a palpable truism no one in his senses will deny not to\r\nadmit the proposition is to insinuate a charge of variability in truth\r\nitself whose very title is a synonym of the steadfast if ability to\r\nconceive be taken as a criterion of truth then a truth to david hume\r\nwould very seldom be a truth to joe and ninetynine hundredths of\r\nwhat is undeniable in heaven would be demonstrable falsity upon earth\r\nthe proposition of mr mill then is sustained i will not grant it to\r\nbe an axiom and this merely because i am showing that no axioms\r\nexist but with a distinction which could not have been cavilled at\r\neven by mr mill himself i am ready to grant that if an axiom there\r\nbe then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be\r\nconsidered an axiomthat no more absolute axiom isand\r\nconsequently that any subsequent proposition which shall conflict with\r\nthis one primarily advanced must be either a falsity in itselfthat is\r\nto say no axiomor if admitted axiomatic must at once neutralize both\r\nitself and its predecessor\r\n\r\nand now by the logic of their own propounder let us proceed to test\r\nany one of the axioms propounded let us give mr mill the fairest of\r\nplay we will bring the point to no ordinary issue we will select for\r\ninvestigation no commonplace axiomno axiom of what not the less\r\npreposterously because only impliedly he terms his secondary classas\r\nif a positive truth by definition could be either more or less\r\npositively a truthwe will select i say no axiom of an\r\nunquestionability so questionable as is to be found in euclid we will\r\nnot talk for example about such propositions as that two straight\r\nlines cannot enclose a space or that the whole is greater than any one\r\nof its parts we will afford the logician every advantage we will\r\ncome at once to a proposition which he regards as the acme of the\r\nunquestionableas the quintessence of axiomatic undeniability here it\r\niscontradictions cannot both be truethat is cannot cöexist in\r\nnature here mr mill means for instanceand i give the most forcible\r\ninstance conceivablethat a tree must be either a tree or not a\r\ntreethat it cannot be at the same time a tree and not a treeall\r\nwhich is quite reasonable of itself and will answer remarkably well as\r\nan axiom until we bring it into collation with an axiom insisted upon a\r\nfew pages beforein other wordswords which i have previously\r\nemployeduntil we test it by the logic of its own propounder a tree\r\nmr mill asserts must be either a tree or not a tree very\r\nwelland now let me ask him why to this little query there is but\r\none responsei defy any man living to invent a second the sole answer\r\nis thisbecause we find it impossible to conceive that a tree can be\r\nany thing else than a tree or not a tree this i repeat is mr mills\r\nsole answerhe will not pretend to suggest anotherand yet by his\r\nown showing his answer is clearly no answer at all for has he not\r\nalready required us to admit as an axiom that ability or inability\r\nto conceive is in no case to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic\r\ntruth thus allabsolutely all his argumentation is at sea without a\r\nrudder let it not be urged that an exception from the general rule is\r\nto be made in cases where the impossibility to conceive is so\r\npeculiarly great as when we are called upon to conceive a tree both a\r\ntree and not a tree let no attempt i say be made at urging this\r\nsotticism for in the first place there are no degrees of\r\nimpossibility and thus no one impossible conception can be more\r\npeculiarly impossible than another impossible conceptionin the second\r\nplace mr mill himself no doubt after thorough deliberation has most\r\ndistinctly and most rationally excluded all opportunity for exception\r\nby the emphasis of his proposition that in no case is ability or\r\ninability to conceive to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic\r\ntruthin the third place even were exceptions admissible at all it\r\nremains to be shown how any exception is admissible here that a tree\r\ncan be both a tree and not a tree is an idea which the angels or the\r\ndevils may entertain and which no doubt many an earthly bedlamite\r\nor transcendentalist does\r\n\r\nnow i do not quarrel with these ancients continues the letterwriter\r\nso much on account of the transparent frivolity of their logicwhich\r\nto be plain was baseless worthless and fantastic altogetheras on\r\naccount of their pompous and infatuate proscription of all other roads\r\nto truth than the two narrow and crooked pathsthe one of creeping and\r\nthe other of crawlingto which in their ignorant perversity they have\r\ndared to confine the soulthe soul which loves nothing so well as to\r\nsoar in those regions of illimitable intuition which are utterly\r\nincognizant of path\r\n\r\nby the bye my dear friend is it not an evidence of the mental slavery\r\nentailed upon those bigoted people by their hogs and rams that in spite\r\nof the eternal prating of their savans about roads to truth none of\r\nthem fell even by accident into what we now so distinctly perceive to\r\nbe the broadest the straightest and most available of all mere\r\nroadsthe great thoroughfarethe majestic highway of the consistent\r\nis it not wonderful that they should have failed to deduce from the\r\nworks of god the vitally momentous consideration that a perfect\r\nconsistency can be nothing but an absolute truth how plainhow rapid\r\nour progress since the late announcement of this proposition by its\r\nmeans investigation has been taken out of the hands of the groundmoles\r\nand given as a duty rather than as a task to the trueto the only true\r\nthinkersto the generallyeducated men of ardent

cryptographist attains the\r\nsolution of the more complicate cyphersor by which of them champollion\r\nguided mankind to those important and innumerable truths which for so\r\nmany centuries have

routesbut i\r\ndo know the machinery of the universe here it is i grasped it with\r\nmy souli reached it through mere dint of intuition alas poor\r\nignorant old man could not any metaphysician have told him that what he\r\ncalled intuition was but the conviction resulting from deductions or\r\ninductions of which the processes were so shadowy as to have escaped\r\nhis consciousness eluded his reason or bidden defiance to his capacity\r\nof expression how great a pity it is that some moral philosopher had\r\nnot enlightened him about all this how it would have comforted him on\r\nhis deathbed to know that instead of having gone intuitively and thus\r\nunbecomingly he had in fact proceeded decorously and\r\nlegitimatelythat is to say hogishly or at least ramishlyinto the\r\nvast halls where lay gleaming untended and hitherto untouched by\r\nmortal handunseen by mortal eyethe imperishable and priceless secrets\r\nof the universe\r\n\r\nyes kepler was essentially a theorist but this title now of so\r\nmuch sanctity was in those ancient days a designation of supreme\r\ncontempt it is only now that men begin to appreciate that divine old\r\nmanto sympathize with the prophetical and poetical rhapsody of his\r\nevermemorable words for my part continues the unknown\r\ncorrespondent i glow with a sacred fire when i even think of them and\r\nfeel that i shall never

wait a century for readers when god himself has waited six\r\nthousand years for an observer i triumph i have stolen the golden\r\nsecret of the egyptians i will indulge my sacred fury\r\n\r\nhere end my quotations from this very unaccountable and perhaps\r\nsomewhat impertinent epistle and perhaps it would be folly to comment\r\nin any respect upon the chimerical not to say revolutionary fancies\r\nof the writerwhoever he isfancies so radically at war with the\r\nwellconsidered and wellsettled opinions of this age let us proceed\r\nthen to our legitimate thesis the universe\r\n\r\nthis thesis admits a choice between two modes of discussionwe may\r\nascend or descend beginning at our own point of viewat the earth\r\non which we standwe may pass to the other planets of our systemthence\r\nto the sunthence to our system considered collectivelyand thence\r\nthrough other systems indefinitely outwards or commencing on high at\r\nsome point as definite as we can make it or conceive it we may come\r\ndown to the habitation of man usuallythat is to say in ordinary\r\nessays on astronomythe first of these two modes is with certain\r\nreservation adoptedthis for the obvious reason that astronomical\r\nfacts merely and principles being the object that object is best\r\nfulfilled in stepping from the known because proximate gradually onward\r\nto the point where all certitude becomes lost in the remote for my\r\npresent purpose howeverthat of enabling the mind to take in as if\r\nfrom afar and at one glance a distinct conception of the individual\r\nuniverseit is clear that a descent to small from greatto the outskirts\r\nfrom the centre if we could establish a centreto the end from the\r\nbeginning if we could fancy a beginning would be the preferable\r\ncourse but for the difficulty if not impossibility of presenting in\r\nthis course to the unastronomical a picture at all comprehensible in\r\nregard to such considerations as are involved in quantitythat is to\r\nsay in number magnitude and distance\r\n\r\nnow distinctnessintelligibility at all points is a primary feature\r\nin my general design on important topics it is better to be a good deal\r\nprolix than even a very little obscure but abstruseness is a quality\r\nappertaining to no subject per se all are alike in facility of\r\ncomprehension to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps\r\nit is merely because a steppingstone here and there is heedlessly\r\nleft unsupplied in our road to the differential calculus that this\r\nlatter is not altogether as simple a thing as a sonnet by mr solomon\r\nseesaw\r\n\r\nby way of admitting then no chance for misapprehension i think it\r\nadvisable to proceed as if even the more obvious facts of astronomy were\r\nunknown to the reader in combining the two modes of discussion to which\r\ni have referred i propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar to\r\neachand very especially of the iteration in detail which will be\r\nunavoidable as a consequence of the plan commencing with a descent i\r\nshall reserve for the return upwards those indispensable considerations\r\nof quantity to which allusion has already been made\r\n\r\nlet us begin then at once with that merest of words infinity\r\nthis like god spirit and some other expressions of which the\r\nequivalents exist in all languages is by no means the expression of an\r\nideabut of an effort at one it stands for the possible attempt at an\r\nimpossible conception man needed a term by which to point out the\r\ndirection of this effortthe cloud behind which lay forever\r\ninvisible the object of this attempt a word in fine was demanded\r\nby means of which one human being might put himself in relation at once\r\nwith another human being and with a certain tendency of the human\r\nintellect out of this demand arose the word infinity which is thus\r\nthe representative but of the thought of a thought\r\n\r\nas regards that infinity now consideredthe infinity of spacewe often\r\nhear it said that its idea is admitted by the mindis acquiesced inis\r\nentertainedon account of the greater difficulty which attends the\r\nconception of a limit but this is merely one of those phrases by\r\nwhich even profound thinkers time out of mind have occasionally taken\r\npleasure in deceiving themselves the quibble lies concealed in the\r\nword difficulty the mind we are told entertains the idea of\r\nlimitless through the greater difficulty which it finds in\r\nentertaining that of limited space now were the proposition but\r\nfairly put its absurdity would become transparent at once clearly\r\nthere is no mere difficulty in the case the assertion intended if\r\npresented according to its intention and without sophistry would run\r\nthusthe mind admits the idea of limitless through the greater\r\nimpossibility of entertaining that of limited space\r\n\r\nit must be immediately seen that this is not a question of two\r\nstatements between whose respective credibilitiesor of two arguments\r\nbetween whose respective validitiesthe reason is called upon to\r\ndecideit is a matter of two conceptions directly conflicting and\r\neach avowedly impossible one of which the intellect is supposed to be\r\ncapable of entertaining on account of the greater impossibility of\r\nentertaining the other the choice is not made between two\r\ndifficultiesit is merely fancied to be made between two\r\nimpossibilities now of the former there are degreesbut of the\r\nlatter nonejust as our impertinent letterwriter has already\r\nsuggested a task may be more or less difficult but it is either\r\npossible or not possiblethere are no gradations it might be more\r\ndifficult to overthrow the andes than an anthill but it can be no\r\nmore impossible to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of\r\nthe other a man may jump ten feet with less difficulty than he can\r\njump twenty but the impossibility of his leaping to the moon is not a\r\nwhit less than that of his leaping to the dogstar\r\n\r\nsince all this is undeniable since the choice of the mind is to be made\r\nbetween impossibilities of conception since one impossibility cannot\r\nbe greater than another and since thus one cannot be preferred to\r\nanother the philosophers who not only maintain on the grounds\r\nmentioned mans idea of infinity but on account of such\r\nsupposititious idea infinity itselfare plainly engaged in\r\ndemonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is\r\nthat some one other thingis impossible too this it will be said is\r\nnonsense and perhaps it isindeed i think it very capital\r\nnonsensebut forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine\r\n\r\nthe readiest mode however of displaying the fallacy of the\r\nphilosophical argument on this question is by simply adverting to a\r\nfact respecting it which has been hitherto quite overlookedthe fact\r\nthat the argument alluded to both proves and disproves its own\r\nproposition the mind is impelled say the theologians and others to\r\nadmit a first cause by the superior difficulty it experiences in\r\nconceiving cause beyond cause without end the quibble as before lies\r\nin the word difficultybut here what is it employed to sustain a\r\nfirst cause and what is a first cause an ultimate termination of\r\ncauses and what is an ultimate termination of causes finitythe\r\nfinite thus the one quibble in two processes by god knows how many\r\nphilosophers is made to support now finity and now infinitycould it\r\nnot be brought to support something besides as for the\r\nquibblersthey at least are insupportable butto dismiss themwhat\r\nthey prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they\r\ndemonstrate in the other\r\n\r\nof course no one will suppose that i here contend for the absolute\r\nimpossibility of that which we attempt to convey in the word\r\ninfinity my purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove\r\ninfinity itself or even our conception of it by any such blundering\r\nratiocination as that which is ordinarily employed\r\n\r\nnevertheless as an individual i may be permitted to say that i\r\ncannot conceive infinity and am convinced that no human being can a\r\nmind not thoroughly selfconsciousnot accustomed to the introspective\r\nanalysis of its own operationswill it is true often deceive itself by\r\nsupposing that it has entertained the conception of which we speak in\r\nthe effort to entertain it we proceed step beyond stepwe fancy point\r\nstill beyond point and so long as we continue the effort it may be\r\nsaid in fact that we are tending to the formation of the idea\r\ndesigned while the strength of the impression that we actually form or\r\nhave formed it is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up\r\nthe mental endeavor but it is in the act of discontinuing the\r\nendeavorof fulfilling as we think the ideaof putting the finishing\r\nstroke as we suppose to the conceptionthat we overthrow at once the\r\nwhole fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and\r\ntherefore definite point this fact however we fail to perceive on\r\naccount of the absolute coincidence in time between the settling down\r\nupon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in thinkingin\r\nattempting on the other hand to frame the idea of a limited space\r\nwe merely converse the processes which involve the impossibility\r\n\r\nwe believe in a god we may or may not believe in finite or in\r\ninfinite space but our belief in such cases is more properly\r\ndesignated as faith and is a matter quite distinct from that belief\r\nproperfrom that intellectual beliefwhich presupposes the mental\r\nconception\r\n\r\nthe fact is that upon the enunciation of any one of that class of\r\nterms to which infinity belongsthe class representing thoughts of\r\nthoughthe who has a right to say that he thinks at all feels\r\nhimself called upon not to entertain a conception but simply to\r\ndirect his mental vision toward some given point in the intellectual\r\nfirmament where lies a nebula never to be resolved to solve it\r\nindeed he makes no effort for with a rapid instinct he comprehends\r\nnot only the impossibility but as regards all human purposes the\r\ninessentiality of its solution he perceives that the deity has not\r\ndesigned it to be solved he sees at once that it lies out of the\r\nbrain of man and even how if not exactly why it lies out of it\r\nthere are people i am aware who busying themselves in attempts at\r\nthe unattainable acquire very easily by dint of the jargon they emit\r\namong those thinkersthattheythink with whom darkness and depth are\r\nsynonymous a kind of cuttlefish reputation for profundity but the\r\nfinest quality of thought is its selfcognizance and with some little\r\nequivocation it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater\r\nthan that which extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain\r\nshuts out even these boundaries themselves from comprehension\r\n\r\nit will now be understood that in using the phrase infinity of\r\nspace i make no call upon the reader to entertain the impossible\r\nconception of an absolute infinity i refer simply to the utmost\r\nconceivable expanse of spacea shadowy and fluctuating domain now\r\nshrinking now swelling in accordance with the vacillating energies of\r\nthe imagination\r\n\r\nhitherto the universe of stars has always been considered as\r\ncoincident with the universe proper as i have defined it in the\r\ncommencement of this discourse it has been always either directly or\r\nindirectly assumedat least since the dawn of intelligible\r\nastronomythat were it possible for us to attain any given point in\r\nspace we should still find on all sides of us an interminable\r\nsuccession of stars this was the untenable idea of pascal when making\r\nperhaps the most successful attempt ever made at periphrasing the\r\nconception for which we struggle in the word universe it is a\r\nsphere he says of which the centre is everywhere the circumference\r\nnowhere but although this intended definition is in fact no\r\ndefinition of the universe of stars we may accept it with some\r\nmental reservation as a definition rigorous enough for all practical\r\npurposes of the universe properthat is to say of the universe of\r\nspace this latter then let us regard as a sphere of which the\r\ncentre is everywhere the circumference nowhere in fact while we\r\nfind it impossible to fancy an end to space we have no difficulty in\r\npicturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of beginnings\r\n\r\nas our startingpoint then let us adopt the godhead of this\r\ngodhead in itself he alone is not imbecilehe alone is not impious\r\nwho propoundsnothing nous ne connaissons rien says the baron de\r\nbielfeldnous ne connaissons rien de la nature ou de lessence de\r\ndieupour savoir ce quil est il faut être dieu mêmewe know\r\nabsolutely nothing of the nature or essence of godin order to\r\ncomprehend what he is we should have to be god ourselves\r\n\r\nwe should have to be god ourselveswith a phrase so startling as\r\nthis yet ringing in my ears i nevertheless venture to demand if this\r\nour present ignorance of the deity is an ignorance to which the soul is\r\neverlastingly condemned\r\n\r\nby him howevernow at least the incomprehensibleby himassuming\r\nhim as spiritthat is to say as not mattera distinction which for\r\nall intelligible purposes will stand well instead of a definitionby\r\nhim then existing as spirit let us content ourselves tonight with\r\nsupposing to have been created or made out of nothing by dint of his\r\nvolitionat some point of space which we will take as a centreat some\r\nperiod into which we do not pretend to inquire but at all events\r\nimmensely remoteby him then again let us suppose to have been\r\ncreatedwhat this is a vitally momentous epoch in our\r\nconsiderations what is it that we are justifiedthat alone we are\r\njustified in supposing to have been primarily and solely created\r\n\r\nwe have attained a point where only intuition can aid usbut now let\r\nme recur to the idea which i have already suggested as that alone which\r\nwe can properly entertain of intuition it is but the conviction\r\narising from those inductions or deductions of which the processes are\r\nso shadowy as to escape our consciousness elude our reason or defy our\r\ncapacity of expression with this understanding i now assertthat an\r\nintuition altogether irresistible although inexpressible forces me to\r\nthe conclusion that what god originally createdthat that matter which\r\nby dint of his volition he first made from his spirit or from\r\nnihility could have been nothing but matter in its utmost conceivable\r\nstate ofwhatof simplicity\r\n\r\nthis will be found the sole absolute assumption of my discourse i use\r\nthe word assumption in its ordinary sense yet i maintain that even\r\nthis my primary proposition is very very far indeed from being really\r\na mere assumption nothing was ever more certainlyno human conclusion\r\nwas ever in fact more regularlymore rigorously deducedbut alas\r\nthe processes lie out of the human analysisat all events are beyond the\r\nutterance of the human tongue\r\n\r\nlet us now endeavor to conceive what matter must be when or if in its\r\nabsolute extreme of simplicity here the reason flies at once to\r\nimparticularityto a particleto one particlea particle of one\r\nkindof one characterof one natureof one sizeof one forma\r\nparticle therefore without form and voida particle positively a\r\nparticle at all pointsa particle absolutely unique individual\r\nundivided and not indivisible only because he who created it by dint\r\nof his will can by an infinitely less energetic exercise of the same\r\nwill as a matter of course divide it\r\n\r\noneness then is all that i predicate of the originally created\r\nmatter but i propose to show that this oneness is a principle\r\nabundantly sufficient to account for the constitution the existing\r\nphænomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the\r\nmaterial universe\r\n\r\nthe willing into being the primordial particle has completed the act\r\nor more properly the conception of creation we now proceed to the\r\nultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the particle createdthat\r\nis to say the ultimate purpose so far as our considerations yet\r\nenable us to see itthe constitution of the universe from it the\r\nparticle\r\n\r\nthis constitution has been effected by forcing the originally and\r\ntherefore normally one into the abnormal condition of many an\r\naction of this character implies rëaction a diffusion from unity under\r\nthe conditions involves a tendency to return into unitya tendency\r\nineradicable until satisfied but on these points i will speak more\r\nfully hereafter\r\n\r\nthe assumption of absolute unity in the primordial particle includes\r\nthat of infinite divisibility let us conceive the particle then to be\r\nonly not totally exhausted by diffusion into space from the one\r\nparticle as a centre let us suppose to be irradiated sphericallyin\r\nall directionsto immeasurable but still to definite distances in the\r\npreviously vacant spacea certain inexpressibly great yet limited number\r\nof unimaginably yet not infinitely minute atoms\r\n\r\nnow of these atoms thus diffused or upon diffusion what conditions\r\nare we permittednot to assume but to infer from consideration as well\r\nof their source as of the character of the design apparent in their\r\ndiffusion unity being their source and difference from unity the\r\ncharacter of the design manifested in their diffusion we are warranted\r\nin supposing this character to be at least generally preserved\r\nthroughout the design and to form a portion of the design itselfthat\r\nis to say we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at\r\nall points from the uniquity and simplicity of the origin but for\r\nthese reasons shall we be justified in imagining the atoms\r\nheterogeneous dissimilar unequal and inequidistant more\r\nexplicitlyare we to consider no two atoms as at their diffusion of\r\nthe same nature or of the same form or of the same sizeand after\r\nfulfilment of their diffusion into space is absolute inequidistance\r\neach from each to be understood of all of them in such arrangement\r\nunder such conditions we most easily and immediately comprehend the\r\nsubsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design\r\nas that which i have suggestedthe design of variety out of\r\nunitydiversity out of samenessheterogeneity out of\r\nhomogeneitycomplexity out of simplicityin a word the utmost possible\r\nmultiplicity of relation out of the emphatically irrelative one\r\nundoubtedly therefore we should be warranted in assuming all that\r\nhas been mentioned but for the reflection first that supererogation\r\nis not presumable of any divine act and secondly that the object\r\nsupposed in view appears as feasible when some of the conditions in\r\nquestion are dispensed with in the beginning as when all are\r\nunderstood immediately to exist i mean to say that some are involved in\r\nthe rest or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the\r\ndistinction inappreciable difference of size for example will at\r\nonce be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second in\r\npreference to a third on account of particular inequidistance which is\r\nto be comprehended as particular inequidistances between centres of\r\nquantity in neighboring atoms of different forma matter not at all\r\ninterfering with the generallyequable distribution of the atoms\r\ndifference of kind too is easily conceived to be merely a result of\r\ndifferences in size and form taken more or less conjointlyin fact\r\nsince the unity of the particle proper implies absolute homogeneity\r\nwe cannot imagine the atoms at their diffusion differing in kind\r\nwithout imagining at the same time a special exercise of the divine\r\nwill at the emission of each atom for the purpose of effecting in\r\neach a change of its essential natureso fantastic an idea is the\r\nless to be indulged as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly\r\nattainable without such minute and elaborate interposition we perceive\r\ntherefore upon the whole that it would be supererogatory and\r\nconsequently unphilosophical to predicate of the atoms in view of\r\ntheir purposes any thing more than difference of form at their\r\ndispersion with particular inequidistance after itall other\r\ndifferences arising at once out of these in the very first processes of\r\nmassconstitutionwe thus establish the universe on a purely\r\ngeometrical basis of course it is by no means necessary to assume\r\nabsolute difference even of form among all the atoms irradiatedany\r\nmore than absolute particular inequidistance of each from each we are\r\nrequired to conceive merely that no neighboring atoms are of similar\r\nformno atoms which can ever approximate until their inevitable\r\nrëunition at the end\r\n\r\nalthough the immediate and perpetual tendency of the disunited atoms\r\nto return into their normal unity is implied as i have said in their\r\nabnormal diffusion still it is clear that this tendency will be without\r\nconsequencea tendency and no moreuntil the diffusive energy in\r\nceasing to be exerted shall leave it the tendency free to seek its\r\nsatisfaction the divine act however being considered as determinate\r\nand discontinued on fulfilment of the diffusion we understand at once\r\na rëactionin other words a satisfiable tendency of the disunited\r\natoms to return into one\r\n\r\nbut the diffusive energy being withdrawn and the rëaction having\r\ncommenced in furtherance of the ultimate designthat of the utmost\r\npossible relationthis design is now in danger of being frustrated in\r\ndetail by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect its\r\naccomplishment in general multiplicity is the object but there is\r\nnothing to prevent proximate atoms from lapsing at once through the\r\nnow satisfiable tendencybefore the fulfilment of any ends proposed in\r\nmultiplicityinto absolute oneness among themselvesthere is nothing to\r\nimpede the aggregation of various unique masses at various points of\r\nspacein other words nothing to interfere with the accumulation of\r\nvarious masses each absolutely one\r\n\r\nfor the effectual and thorough completion of the general design we thus\r\nsee the necessity for a repulsion of limited capacitya separative\r\nsomething which on withdrawal of the diffusive volition shall at the\r\nsame time allow the approach and forbid the junction of the atoms\r\nsuffering them infinitely to approximate while denying them positive\r\ncontact in a word having the powerup to a certain epochof\r\npreventing their coalition but no ability to interfere with their\r\ncoalescence in any respect or degree the repulsion already\r\nconsidered as so peculiarly limited in other regards must be\r\nunderstood let me repeat as having power to prevent absolute\r\ncoalition only up to a certain epoch unless we are to conceive that\r\nthe appetite for unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied\r\nneverunless we are to conceive that what had a beginning is to have\r\nno enda conception which cannot really be entertained however much\r\nwe may talk or dream of entertaining itwe are forced to conclude that\r\nthe repulsive influence imagined will finallyunder pressure of the\r\nunitendency collectively applied but never and in no degree until\r\non fulfilment of the divine purposes such collective application shall\r\nbe naturally madeyield to a force which at that ultimate epoch shall\r\nbe the superior force precisely to the extent required and thus permit\r\nthe universal subsidence into the inevitable because original and\r\ntherefore normal onethe conditions here to be reconciled are\r\ndifficult indeedwe cannot even comprehend the possibility of their\r\nconciliationnevertheless the apparent impossibility is brilliantly\r\nsuggestive\r\n\r\nthat the repulsive something actually exists we see man neither\r\nemploys nor knows a force sufficient to bring two atoms into contact\r\nthis is but the wellestablished proposition of the impenetrability of\r\nmatter all experiment provesall philosophy admits it the design of\r\nthe repulsionthe necessity for its existencei have endeavored to show\r\nbut from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously\r\nabstained this on account of an intuitive conviction that the principle\r\nat issue is strictly spirituallies in a recess impervious to our\r\npresent understandinglies involved in a consideration of what nowin\r\nour human stateis not to be consideredin a consideration of spirit\r\nin itself i feel in a word that here the god has interposed and\r\nhere only because here and here only the knot demanded the\r\ninterposition of the god\r\n\r\nin fact while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into unity\r\nwill be recognized at once as the principle of the newtonian gravity\r\nwhat i have spoken of as a repulsive influence prescribing limits to the\r\nimmediate satisfaction of the tendency will be understood as that\r\nwhich we have been in the practice of designating now as heat now as\r\nmagnetism now as electricity displaying our ignorance of its awful\r\ncharacter in the vacillation of the phraseology with which we endeavor\r\nto circumscribe it\r\n\r\ncalling it merely for the moment electricity we know that all\r\nexperimental analysis of electricity has given as an ultimate result\r\nthe principle or seeming principle heterogeneity only where\r\nthings differ is electricity apparent and it is presumable that they\r\nnever differ where it is not developed at least if not apparent now\r\nthis result is in the fullest keeping with that which i have reached\r\nunempirically the design of the repulsive influence i have maintained\r\nto be that of preventing immediate unity among the diffused atoms and\r\nthese atoms are represented as different each from each difference is\r\ntheir charactertheir essentialityjust as nodifference was the\r\nessentiality of their source when we say then that an attempt to\r\nbring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort on the\r\npart of the repulsive influence to prevent the contact we may as well\r\nuse the strictly convertible sentence that an attempt to bring together\r\nany two differences will result in a development of electricity all\r\nexisting bodies of course are composed of these atoms in proximate\r\ncontact and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more\r\nor fewer differences and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit\r\non bringing together any two such assemblages would be in the ratio of\r\nthe two sums of the differences in eachan expression which when\r\nreduced is equivalent to thisthe amount of electricity developed on\r\nthe approximation of two bodies is proportional to the difference\r\nbetween the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are\r\ncomposed that no two bodies are absolutely alike is a simple\r\ncorollary from all that has been here said electricity therefore\r\nexisting always is developed whenever any bodies but manifested\r\nonly when bodies of appreciable difference are brought into\r\napproximation\r\n\r\nto electricityso for the present continuing to call itwe may not\r\nbe wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light heat\r\nand magnetism but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to\r\nthis strictly spiritual principle the more important phænomena of\r\nvitality consciousness and thought on this topic however i need\r\npause here merely to suggest that these phænomena whether observed\r\ngenerally or in detail seem to proceed at least in the ratio of the\r\nheterogeneous\r\n\r\ndiscarding now the two equivocal terms gravitation and electricity\r\nlet us adopt the more definite expressions attraction and\r\nrepulsion the former is the body the latter the soul the one is\r\nthe material the other the spiritual principle of the universe no\r\nother principles exist all phænomena are referable to one or to the\r\nother or to both combined so rigorously is this the caseso thoroughly\r\ndemonstrable is it that attraction and repulsion are the sole\r\nproperties through which we perceive the universein other words by\r\nwhich matter is manifested to mindthat for all merely argumentative\r\npurposes we are fully justified in assuming that matter exists only\r\nas attraction and repulsionthat attraction and repulsion are\r\nmatterthere being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the\r\nterm matter and the terms attraction and repulsion taken\r\ntogether as equivalent and therefore convertible expressions in\r\nlogic\r\n\r\ni said just now that what i have described as the tendency of the\r\ndiffused atoms to return into their original unity would be understood\r\nas the principle of the newtonian law of gravity and in fact there\r\ncan be little difficulty in such an understanding if we look at the\r\nnewtonian gravity in a merely general view as a force impelling matter\r\nto seek matter that is to say when we pay no attention to the known\r\nmodus operandi of the newtonian force the general coincidence\r\nsatisfies us but upon looking closely we see in detail much that\r\nappears incoincident and much in regard to which no coincidence at\r\nleast is established for example the newtonian gravity when we think\r\nof it in certain moods does not seem to be a tendency to oneness at\r\nall but rather a tendency of all bodies in all directionsa phrase\r\napparently expressive of a tendency to diffusion here then is an\r\nincoincidence again when we reflect on the mathematical law\r\ngoverning the newtonian tendency we see clearly that no coincidence has\r\nbeen made good in respect of the modus operandi at least between\r\ngravitation as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct\r\ntendency which i have assumed\r\n\r\nin fact i have attained a point at which it will be advisable to\r\nstrengthen my position by reversing my processes so far we have gone\r\non à priori from an abstract consideration of simplicity as that\r\nquality most likely to have characterized the original action of god\r\nlet us now see whether the established facts of the newtonian\r\ngravitation may not afford us à posteriori some legitimate\r\ninductions\r\n\r\nwhat does the newtonian law declarethat all bodies attract each other\r\nwith forces proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely\r\nproportional to the squares of their distances purposely i have here\r\ngiven in the first place the vulgar version of the law and i confess\r\nthat in this as in most other vulgar versions of great truths we find\r\nlittle of a suggestive character let us now adopt a more philosophical\r\nphraseologyevery atom of every body attracts every other atom both\r\nof its own and of every other body with a force which varies inversely\r\nas the squares of the distances between the attracting and attracted\r\natomhere indeed a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind\r\n\r\nbut let us see distinctly what it was that newton provedaccording to\r\nthe grossly irrational definitions of proof prescribed by the\r\nmetaphysical schools he was forced to content himself with showing how\r\nthoroughly the motions of an imaginary universe composed of attracting\r\nand attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced coincide with\r\nthose of the actually existing universe so far as it comes under our\r\nobservation this was the amount of his demonstrationthat is to say\r\nthis was the amount of it according to the conventional cant of the\r\nphilosophies his successes added proof multiplied by proofsuch proof\r\nas a sound intellect admitsbut the demonstration of the law itself\r\npersist the metaphysicians had not been strengthened in any degree\r\nocular physical proof however of attraction here upon earth\r\nin accordance with the newtonian theory was at length much to the\r\nsatisfaction of some intellectual grovellers afforded this proof arose\r\ncollaterally and incidentally as nearly all important truths have\r\narisen out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the earth in\r\nthe famous maskelyne cavendish and bailly experiments for this purpose\r\nthe attraction of the mass of a mountain was seen felt measured and\r\nfound to be mathematically consistent with the immortal theory of the\r\nbritish astronomer\r\n\r\nbut in spite of this confirmation of that which needed nonein spite of\r\nthe socalled corroboration of the theory by the socalled ocular and\r\nphysical proofin spite of the character of this corroborationthe\r\nideas which even really philosophical men cannot help imbibing of\r\ngravityand especially the ideas of it which ordinary men get and\r\ncontentedly maintain are seen to have been derived for the most\r\npart from a consideration of the principle as they find it\r\ndevelopedmerely in the planet upon which they stand\r\n\r\nnow to what does so partial a consideration tendto what species of\r\nerror does it give rise on the earth we see and feel only that\r\ngravity impels all bodies towards the centre of the earth no man in\r\nthe common walks of life could be made to see or to feel anything\r\nelsecould be made to perceive that anything anywhere has a perpetual\r\ngravitating tendency in any other direction than to the centre of the\r\nearth yet with an exception hereafter to be specified it is a fact\r\nthat every earthly thing not to speak now of every heavenly thing has\r\na tendency not only to the earths centre but in every conceivable\r\ndirection besides\r\n\r\nnow although the philosophic cannot be said to err with the vulgar in\r\nthis matter they nevertheless permit themselves to be influenced\r\nwithout knowing it by the sentiment of the vulgar idea although the\r\npagan fables are not believed says bryant in his very erudite\r\nmythology yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences\r\nfrom them as from existing realities i mean to assert that the merely\r\nsensitive perception of gravity as we experience it on earth beguiles\r\nmankind into the fancy of concentralization or especiality\r\nrespecting ithas been continually biasing towards this fancy even the\r\nmightiest intellectsperpetually although imperceptibly leading them\r\naway from the real characteristics of the principle thus preventing\r\nthem up to this date from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth\r\nwhich lies in a diametrically opposite directionbehind the principles\r\nessential characteristicsthose not of concentralization or\r\nespecialitybut of universality and diffusion this vital truth is\r\nunity as the source of the phænomenon\r\n\r\nlet me now repeat the definition of gravityevery atom of every body\r\nattracts every other atom both of its own and of every other body\r\nwith a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of\r\nthe attracting and attracted atom\r\n\r\nhere let the reader pause with me for a moment in contemplation of the\r\nmiraculousof the ineffableof the altogether unimaginable complexity of\r\nrelation involved in the fact that each atom attracts every other\r\natominvolved merely in this fact of the attraction without reference\r\nto the law or mode in which the attraction is manifestedinvolved\r\nmerely in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom at all\r\nin a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the\r\ncomposition of a cannonball exceed probably in mere point of number\r\nall the stars which go to the constitution of the universe\r\n\r\nhad we discovered simply that each atom tended to some one favorite\r\npointto some especially attractive atomwe should still have fallen\r\nupon a discovery which in itself would have sufficed to overwhelm the\r\nmindbut what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend\r\nthat each atom attractssympathizes with the most delicate movements of\r\nevery other atom and with each and with all at the same time and\r\nforever and according to a determinate law of which the complexity\r\neven considered by itself solely is utterly beyond the grasp of the\r\nimagination of man if i propose to ascertain the influence of one mote\r\nin a sunbeam upon its neighboring mote i cannot accomplish my purpose\r\nwithout first counting and weighing all the atoms in the universe and\r\ndefining the precise positions of all at one particular moment if i\r\nventure to displace by even the billionth part of an inch the\r\nmicroscopical speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my finger\r\nwhat is the character of that act upon which i have adventured i have\r\ndone a deed which shakes the moon in her path which causes the sun to\r\nbe no longer the sun and which alters forever the destiny of the\r\nmultitudinous myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic\r\npresence of their creator\r\n\r\nthese ideasconceptions such as theseunthoughtlike\r\nthoughtssoulreveries rather than conclusions or even considerations\r\nof the intellectideas i repeat such as these are such as we can\r\nalone hope profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great\r\nprinciple attraction\r\n\r\nbut nowwith such ideaswith such a vision of the marvellous\r\ncomplexity of attraction fairly in his mindlet any person competent of\r\nthought on such topics as these set himself to the task of imagining a\r\nprinciple for the phænomena observeda condition from which they\r\nsprang\r\n\r\ndoes not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common\r\nparentage does not a sympathy so omniprevalent so ineradicable and so\r\nthoroughly irrespective suggest a common paternity as its source does\r\nnot one extreme impel the reason to the other does not the infinitude\r\nof division refer to the utterness of individuality does not the\r\nentireness of the complex hint at the perfection of the simple it is\r\nnot that the atoms as we see them are divided or that they are\r\ncomplex in their relationsbut that they are inconceivably divided and\r\nunutterably complexit is the extremeness of the conditions to which i\r\nnow allude rather than to the conditions themselves in a word is it\r\nnot because the atoms were at some remote epoch of time even more\r\nthan togetheris it not because originally and therefore normally\r\nthey were onethat now in all circumstancesat all pointsin all\r\ndirectionsby all modes of approachin all relations and through all\r\nconditionsthey struggle back to this absolutely this irrelatively\r\nthis unconditionally one\r\n\r\nsome person may here demandwhysince it is to the one that the\r\natoms struggle backdo we not find and define attraction a merely\r\ngeneral tendency to a centrewhy in especial do not your\r\natomsthe atoms which you describe as having been irradiated from a\r\ncentreproceed at once rectilinearly back to the central point of\r\ntheir origin\r\n\r\ni reply that they do as will be distinctly shown but that the cause\r\nof their so doing is quite irrespective of the centre as such they\r\nall tend rectilinearly towards a centre because of the sphereicity with\r\nwhich they have been irradiated into space each atom forming one of a\r\ngenerally uniform globe of atoms finds more atoms in the direction of\r\nthe centre of course than in any other and in that direction\r\ntherefore is impelledbut is not thus impelled because the centre is\r\nthe point of its origin it is not to any point that the atoms are\r\nallied it is not any locality either in the concrete or in the\r\nabstract to which i suppose them bound nothing like location was\r\nconceived as their origin their source lies in the principle unity\r\nthis is their lost parent this they seek alwaysimmediatelyin all\r\ndirectionswherever it is even partially to be found thus appeasing in\r\nsome measure the ineradicable tendency while on the way to its\r\nabsolute satisfaction in the end it follows from all this that any\r\nprinciple which shall be adequate to account for the law or modus\r\noperandi of the attractive force in general will account for this law\r\nin particularthat is to say any principle which will show why the\r\natoms should tend to their general centre of irradiation with forces\r\ninversely proportional to the squares of the distances will be admitted\r\nas satisfactorily accounting at the same time for the tendency\r\naccording to the same law of these atoms each to eachfor the\r\ntendency to the centre is merely the tendency each to each and not\r\nany tendency to a centre as suchthus it will be seen also that the\r\nestablishment of my propositions would involve no necessity of\r\nmodification in the terms of the newtonian definition of gravity which\r\ndeclares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth and\r\ndeclares this merely but always under the supposition that what i\r\npropose be in the end admitted it seems clear that some error might\r\noccasionally be avoided in the future processes of science were a more\r\nample phraseology adoptedfor instanceeach atom tends to every other\r\natom c with a force c the general result being a tendency of all\r\nwith a similar force to a general centre\r\n\r\nthe reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical\r\nresult but while in the one process intuition was the\r\nstartingpoint in the other it was the goal in commencing the former\r\njourney i could only say that with an irresistible intuition i felt\r\nsimplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of\r\ngodin ending the latter i can only declare that with an irresistible\r\nintuition i perceive unity to have been the source of the observed\r\nphænomena of the newtonian gravitation thus according to the schools\r\ni prove nothing so be iti design but to suggestand to convince\r\nthrough the suggestion i am proudly aware that there exist many of the\r\nmost profound and cautiously discriminative human intellects which\r\ncannot help being abundantly content with mysuggestions to these\r\nintellectsas to my ownthere is no mathematical demonstration which\r\ncould bring the least additional true proof of the great truth\r\nwhich i have advancedthe truth of original unity as the sourceas the\r\nprinciple of the universal phænomena for my part i am not so sure\r\nthat i speak and seei am not so sure that my heart beats and that my\r\nsoul livesof the rising of tomorrows suna probability that as yet\r\nlies in the futurei do not pretend to be one thousandth part as sureas\r\ni am of the irretrievably bygone fact that all things and all\r\nthoughts of things with all their ineffable multiplicity of relation\r\nsprang at once into being from the primordial and irrelative one\r\n\r\nreferring to the newtonian gravity dr nichol the eloquent author of\r\nthe architecture of the heavens saysin truth we have no reason to\r\nsuppose this great law as now revealed to be the ultimate or simplest\r\nand therefore the universal and allcomprehensive form of a great\r\nordinance the mode in which its intensity diminishes with the element\r\nof distance has not the aspect of an ultimate principle which always\r\nassumes the simplicity and selfevidence of those axioms which\r\nconstitute the basis of geometry\r\n\r\nnow it is quite true that ultimate principles in the common\r\nunderstanding of the words always assume the simplicity of geometrical\r\naxiomsas for selfevidence there is no such thingbut these\r\nprinciples are clearly not ultimate in other terms what we are in\r\nthe habit of calling principles are no principles properly\r\nspeakingsince there can be but one principle the volition of god we\r\nhave no right to assume then from what we observe in rules that we\r\nchoose foolishly to name principles anything at all in respect to the\r\ncharacteristics of a principle proper the ultimate principles of\r\nwhich dr nichol speaks as having geometrical simplicity may and do\r\nhave this geometrical turn as being part and parcel of a vast\r\ngeometrical system and thus a system of simplicity itselfin which\r\nnevertheless the truly ultimate principle is as we know the\r\nconsummation of the complexthat is to say of the unintelligiblefor is\r\nit not the spiritual capacity of god\r\n\r\ni quoted dr nichols remark however not so much to question its\r\nphilosophy as by way of calling attention to the fact that while all\r\nmen have admitted some principle as existing behind the law of\r\ngravity no attempt has been yet made to point out what this principle\r\nin particular isif we except perhaps occasional fantastic efforts\r\nat referring it to magnetism or mesmerism or swedenborgianism or\r\ntranscendentalism or some other equally delicious ism of the same\r\nspecies and invariably patronized by one and the same species of\r\npeople the great mind of newton while boldly grasping the law itself\r\nshrank from the principle of the law the more fluent and comprehensive\r\nat least if not the more patient and profound sagacity of laplace had\r\nnot the courage to attack it but hesitation on the part of these two\r\nastronomers it is perhaps not so very difficult to understand they\r\nas well as all the first class of mathematicians were mathematicians\r\nsolelytheir intellect at least had a firmlypronounced\r\nmathematicophysical tone what lay not distinctly within the domain of\r\nphysics or of mathematics seemed to them either nonentity or shadow\r\nnevertheless we may well wonder that leibnitz who was a marked\r\nexception to the general rule in these respects and whose mental\r\ntemperament was a singular admixture of the mathematical with the\r\nphysicometaphysical did not at once investigate and establish the\r\npoint at issue either newton or laplace seeking a principle and\r\ndiscovering none physical would have rested contentedly in the\r\nconclusion that there was absolutely none but it is almost impossible\r\nto fancy of leibnitz that having exhausted in his search the physical\r\ndominions he would not have stepped at once boldly and hopefully amid\r\nhis old familiar haunts in the kingdom of metaphysics here indeed it\r\nis clear that he must have adventured in search of the treasurethat\r\nhe did not find it after all was perhaps because his fairy guide\r\nimagination was not sufficiently wellgrown or welleducated to\r\ndirect him aright\r\n\r\ni observed just now that in fact there had been certain vague\r\nattempts at referring gravity to some very uncertain isms these\r\nattempts however although considered bold and justly so considered\r\nlooked no farther than to the generalitythe merest generalityof the\r\nnewtonian law its modus operandi has never to my knowledge been\r\napproached in the way of an effort at explanation it is therefore\r\nwith no unwarranted fear of being taken for a madman at the outset and\r\nbefore i can bring my propositions fairly to the eye of those who alone\r\nare competent to decide upon them that i here declare the modus\r\noperandi of the law of gravity to be an exceedingly simple and\r\nperfectly explicable thingthat is to say when we make our advances\r\ntowards it in just gradations and in the true directionwhen we regard\r\nit from the proper point of view\r\n\r\nwhether we reach the idea of absolute unity as the source of all\r\nthings from a consideration of simplicity as the most probable\r\ncharacteristic of the original action of godwhether we arrive at it\r\nfrom an inspection of the universality of relation in the gravitating\r\nphænomenaor whether we attain it as a result of the mutual\r\ncorroboration afforded by both processesstill the idea itself if\r\nentertained at all is entertained in inseparable connection with\r\nanother ideathat of the condition of the universe of stars as we now\r\nperceive itthat is to say a condition of immeasurable diffusion\r\nthrough space now a connection between these two ideasunity and\r\ndiffusioncannot be established unless through the entertainment of a\r\nthird ideathat of irradiation absolute unity being taken as a\r\ncentre then the existing universe of stars is the result of\r\nirradiation from that centre\r\n\r\nnow the laws of irradiation are known they are part and parcel of\r\nthe sphere they belong to the class of indisputable geometrical\r\nproperties we say of them they are truethey are evident to demand\r\nwhy they are true would be to demand why the axioms are true upon\r\nwhich their demonstration is based nothing is demonstrable strictly\r\nspeaking but if anything be then the propertiesthe laws in\r\nquestion are demonstrated\r\n\r\nbut these lawswhat do they declare irradiationhowby what steps does\r\nit proceed outwardly from a centre\r\n\r\nfrom a luminous centre light issues by irradiation and the\r\nquantities of light received upon any given plane supposed to be\r\nshifting its position so as to be now nearer the centre and now farther\r\nfrom it will be diminished in the same proportion as the squares of the\r\ndistances of the plane from the luminous body are increased and will\r\nbe increased in the same proportion as these squares are diminished\r\n\r\nthe expression of the law may be thus generalizedthe number of\r\nlightparticles or if the phrase be preferred the number of\r\nlightimpressions received upon the shifting plane will be inversely\r\nproportional with the squares of the distances of the plane\r\ngeneralizing yet again we may say that the diffusionthe scatteringthe\r\nirradiation in a wordis directly proportional with the squares of\r\nthe distances\r\n\r\nillustration\r\n\r\nfor example at the distance b from the luminous centre a a certain\r\nnumber of particles are so diffused as to occupy the surface b then at\r\ndouble the distancethat is to say at cthey will be so much farther\r\ndiffused as to occupy four such surfacesat treble the distance or at\r\nd they will be so much farther separated as to occupy nine such\r\nsurfaceswhile at quadruple the distance or at e they will have\r\nbecome so scattered as to spread themselves over sixteen such\r\nsurfacesand so on forever\r\n\r\nin saying generally that the irradiation proceeds in direct proportion\r\nwith the squares of the distances we use the term irradiation to\r\nexpress the degree of the diffusion as we proceed outwardly from the\r\ncentre conversing the idea and employing the word concentralization\r\nto express the degree of the drawing together as we come back toward\r\nthe centre from an outward position we may say that concentralization\r\nproceeds inversely as the squares of the distances in other words we\r\nhave reached the conclusion that on the hypothesis that matter was\r\noriginally irradiated from a centre and is now returning to it the\r\nconcentralization in the return proceeds exactly as we know the force\r\nof gravitation to proceed\r\n\r\nnow here if we could be permitted to assume that concentralization\r\nexactly represented the force of the tendency to the centrethat the\r\none was exactly proportional to the other and that the two proceeded\r\ntogetherwe should have shown all that is required the sole difficulty\r\nexisting then is to establish a direct proportion between\r\nconcentralization and the force of concentralization and this is\r\ndone of course if we establish such proportion between irradiation\r\nand the force of irradiation\r\n\r\na very slight inspection of the heavens assures us that the stars have a\r\ncertain general uniformity equability or equidistance of distribution\r\nthrough that region of space in which collectively and in a roughly\r\nglobular form they are situatedthis species of very general rather\r\nthan absolute equability being in full keeping with my deduction of\r\ninequidistance within certain limits among the originally diffused\r\natoms as a corollary from the evident design of infinite complexity of\r\nrelation out of irrelation i started it will be remembered with the\r\nidea of a generally uniform but particularly ununiform distribution of\r\nthe atomsan idea i repeat which an inspection of the stars as they\r\nexist confirms\r\n\r\nbut even in the merely general equability of distribution as regards\r\nthe atoms there appears a difficulty which no doubt has already\r\nsuggested itself to those among my readers who have borne in mind that i\r\nsuppose this equability of distribution effected through irradiation\r\nfrom a centre the very first glance at the idea irradiation forces\r\nus to the entertainment of the hitherto unseparated and seemingly\r\ninseparable idea of agglomeration about a centre with dispersion as we\r\nrecede from itthe idea in a word of inequability of distribution in\r\nrespect to the matter irradiated\r\n\r\nnow i have elsewhere observed that it is by just such difficulties\r\nas the one now in questionsuch roughnessessuch peculiaritiessuch\r\nprotuberances above the plane of the ordinarythat reason feels her way\r\nif at all in her search for the true by the difficultythe\r\npeculiaritynow presented i leap at once to the secreta secret\r\nwhich i might never have attained but for the peculiarity and the\r\ninferences which in its mere character of peculiarity it affords me\r\n\r\n     murders in the rue morguep \r\n\r\nthe process of thought at this point may be thus roughly sketchedi\r\nsay to myselfunity as i have explained it is a truthi feel it\r\ndiffusion is a truthi see it irradiation by which alone these two\r\ntruths are reconciled is a consequent truthi perceive it equability\r\nof diffusion first deduced à priori and then corroborated by the\r\ninspection of phænomena is also a truthi fully admit it so far all is\r\nclear around methere are no clouds behind which the secretthe great\r\nsecret of the gravitating modus operandican possibly lie hiddenbut\r\nthis secret lies hereabouts most assuredly and were there but a\r\ncloud in view i should be driven to suspicion of that cloud and now\r\njust as i say this there actually comes a cloud into view this cloud\r\nis the seeming impossibility of reconciling my truth irradiation\r\nwith my truth equability of diffusion i say nowbehind this\r\nseeming impossibility is to be found what i desire i do not say\r\nreal impossibility for invincible faith in my truths assures me\r\nthat it is a mere difficulty after allbut i go on to say with\r\nunflinching confidence that when this difficulty shall be solved\r\nwe shall find wrapped up in the process of solution the key to the\r\nsecret at which we aim moreoveri feel that we shall discover but\r\none possible solution of the difficulty this for the reason that were\r\nthere two one would be supererogatorywould be fruitlesswould be\r\nemptywould contain no keysince no duplicate key can be needed to any\r\nsecret of nature\r\n\r\nand now let us seeour usual notions of irradiationin fact all our\r\ndistinct notions of itare caught merely from the process as we see it\r\nexemplified in light here there is a continuous outpouring of\r\nraystreams and with a force which we have at least no right to\r\nsuppose varies at all now in any such irradiation as\r\nthiscontinuous and of unvarying forcethe regions nearer the centre\r\nmust inevitably be always more crowded with the irradiated matter than\r\nthe regions more remote but i have assumed no such irradiation as\r\nthis i assumed no continuous irradiation and for the simple reason\r\nthat such an assumption would have involved first the necessity of\r\nentertaining a conception which i have shown no man can entertain and\r\nwhich as i will more fully explain hereafter all observation of the\r\nfirmament refutesthe conception of the absolute infinity of the\r\nuniverse of starsand would have involved secondly the impossibility\r\nof understanding a rëactionthat is gravitationas existing nowsince\r\nwhile an act is continued no rëaction of course can take place my\r\nassumption then or rather my inevitable deduction from just\r\npremiseswas that of a determinate irradiationone finally\r\ndiscontinued\r\n\r\nlet me now describe the sole possible mode in which it is conceivable\r\nthat matter could have been diffused through space so as to fulfil the\r\nconditions at once of irradiation and of generally equable distribution\r\n\r\nfor convenience of illustration let us imagine in the first place a\r\nhollow sphere of glass or of anything else occupying the space\r\nthroughout which the universal matter is to be thus equally diffused by\r\nmeans of irradiation from the absolute irrelative unconditional\r\nparticle placed in the centre of the sphere\r\n\r\nnow a certain exertion of the diffusive power presumed to be the\r\ndivine volitionin other words a certain forcewhose measure is the\r\nquantity of matterthat is to say the number of atomsemitted emits\r\nby irradiation this certain number of atoms forcing them in all\r\ndirections outwardly from the centretheir proximity to each other\r\ndiminishing as they proceeduntil finally they are distributed\r\nloosely over the interior surface of the sphere\r\n\r\nwhen these atoms have attained this position or while proceeding to\r\nattain it a second and inferior exercise of the same forceor a second\r\nand inferior force of the same characteremits in the same mannerthat\r\nis to say by irradiation as beforea second stratum of atoms which\r\nproceeds to deposit itself upon the first the number of atoms in this\r\ncase as in the former being of course the measure of the force which\r\nemitted them in other words the force being precisely adapted to the\r\npurpose it effectsthe force and the number of atoms sent out by the\r\nforce being directly proportional\r\n\r\nwhen this second stratum has reached its destined positionor while\r\napproaching ita third still inferior exertion of the force or a third\r\ninferior force of a similar characterthe number of atoms emitted being\r\nin all cases the measure of the forceproceeds to deposit a third\r\nstratum upon the secondand so on until these concentric strata\r\ngrowing gradually less and less come down at length to the central\r\npoint and the diffusive matter simultaneously with the diffusive\r\nforce is exhausted\r\n\r\nwe have now the sphere filled through means of irradiation with atoms\r\nequably diffused the two necessary conditionsthose of irradiation and\r\nof equable diffusionare satisfied and by the sole process in which\r\nthe possibility of their simultaneous satisfaction is conceivable for\r\nthis reason i confidently expect to find lurking in the present\r\ncondition of the atoms as distributed throughout the sphere the secret\r\nof which i am in searchthe allimportant principle of the modus\r\noperandi of the newtonian law let us examine then the actual\r\ncondition of the atoms\r\n\r\nthey lie in a series of concentric strata they are equably diffused\r\nthroughout the sphere they have been irradiated into these states\r\n\r\nthe atoms being equably distributed the greater the superficial\r\nextent of any of these concentric strata or spheres the more atoms\r\nwill lie upon it in other words the number of atoms lying upon the\r\nsurface of any one of the concentric spheres is directly proportional\r\nwith the extent of that surface\r\n\r\nbut in any series of concentric spheres the surfaces are directly\r\nproportional with the squares of the distances from the centre\r\n\r\n     succinctlythe surfaces of spheres are as the squares of\r\n    their radii\r\n\r\ntherefore the number of atoms in any stratum is directly proportional\r\nwith the square of that stratums distance from the centre\r\n\r\nbut the number of atoms in any stratum is the measure of the force which\r\nemitted that stratumthat is to say is directly proportional with the\r\nforce\r\n\r\ntherefore the force which irradiated any stratum is directly\r\nproportional with the square of that stratums distance from the\r\ncentreor generally\r\n\r\nthe force of the irradiation has been directly proportional with the\r\nsquares of the distances\r\n\r\nnow rëaction as far as we know anything of it is action conversed\r\nthe general principle of gravity being in the first place understood\r\nas the rëaction of an actas the expression of a desire on the part of\r\nmatter while existing in a state of diffusion to return into the unity\r\nwhence it was diffused and in the second place the mind being called\r\nupon to determine the character of the desirethe manner in which it\r\nwould naturally be manifested in other words being called upon to\r\nconceive a probable law or modus operandi for the return could not\r\nwell help arriving at the conclusion that this law of return would be\r\nprecisely the converse of the law of departure that such would be the\r\ncase any one at least would be abundantly justified in taking for\r\ngranted until such time as some person should suggest something like a\r\nplausible reason why it should not be the caseuntil such period as a\r\nlaw of return shall be imagined which the intellect can consider as\r\npreferable\r\n\r\nmatter then irradiated into space with a force varying as the squares\r\nof the distances might à priori be supposed to return towards its\r\ncentre of irradiation with a force varying inversely as the squares of\r\nthe distances and i have already shown that any principle which will\r\nexplain why the atoms should tend according to any law to the general\r\ncentre must be admitted as satisfactorily explaining at the same time\r\nwhy according to the same law they should tend each to each for in\r\nfact the tendency to the general centre is not to a centre as such but\r\nbecause of its being a point in tending towards which each atom tends\r\nmost directly to its real and essential centre unitythe absolute\r\nand final union of all\r\n\r\n     page \r\n\r\nthe consideration here involved presents to my own mind no embarrassment\r\nwhateverbut this fact does not blind me to the possibility of its being\r\nobscure to those who may have been less in the habit of dealing with\r\nabstractionsand upon the whole it may be as well to look at the\r\nmatter from one or two other points of view\r\n\r\nthe absolute irrelative particle primarily created by the volition of\r\ngod must have been in a condition of positive normality or\r\nrightfulnessfor wrongfulness implies relation right is positive\r\nwrong is negativeis merely the negation of right as cold is the\r\nnegation of heatdarkness of light that a thing may be wrong it is\r\nnecessary that there be some other thing in relation to which it is\r\nwrongsome condition which it fails to satisfy some law which it\r\nviolates some being whom it aggrieves if there be no such being law\r\nor condition in respect to which the thing is wrongand still more\r\nespecially if no beings laws or conditions exist at allthen the\r\nthing cannot be wrong and consequently must be right any deviation\r\nfrom normality involves a tendency to return into it a difference from\r\nthe normalfrom the rightfrom the justcan be understood as effected\r\nonly by the overcoming a difficulty and if the force which overcomes\r\nthe difficulty be not infinitely continued the ineradicable tendency to\r\nreturn will at length be permitted to act for its own satisfaction upon\r\nwithdrawal of the force the tendency acts this is the principle of\r\nrëaction as the inevitable consequence of finite action employing a\r\nphraseology of which the seeming affectation will be pardoned for its\r\nexpressiveness we may say that rëaction is the return from the\r\ncondition of as it is and ought not to be into the condition of as it\r\nwas originally and therefore ought to beand let me add here that\r\nthe absolute force of rëaction would no doubt be always found in\r\ndirect proportion with the realitythe truththe absolutenessof the\r\noriginalityif ever it were possible to measure this latterand\r\nconsequently the greatest of all conceivable reactions must be that\r\nproduced by the tendency which we now discussthe tendency to return\r\ninto the absolutely originalinto the supremely primitive gravity\r\nthen must be the strongest of forcesan idea reached à priori and\r\nabundantly confirmed by induction what use i make of the idea will be\r\nseen in the sequel\r\n\r\nthe atoms now having been diffused from their normal condition of\r\nunity seek to return towhat not to any particular point\r\ncertainly for it is clear that if upon the diffusion the whole\r\nuniverse of matter had been projected collectively to a distance from\r\nthe point of irradiation the atomic tendency to the general centre of\r\nthe sphere would not have been disturbed in the leastthe atoms would\r\nnot have sought the point in absolute space from which they were\r\noriginally impelled it is merely the condition and not the point or\r\nlocality at which this condition took its rise that these atoms seek to\r\nreestablishit is merely that condition which is their normality\r\nthat they desire but they seek a centre it will be said and a\r\ncentre is a point true but they seek this point not in its character\r\nof pointfor were the whole sphere moved from its position they would\r\nseek equally the centre and the centre then would be a new\r\npointbut because it so happens on account of the form in which they\r\ncollectively existthat of the spherethat only through the point in\r\nquestionthe spheres centrethey can attain their true object unity\r\nin the direction of the centre each atom perceives more atoms than in\r\nany other direction each atom is impelled towards the centre because\r\nalong the straight line joining it and the centre and passing on to the\r\ncircumference beyond there lie a greater number of atoms than along any\r\nother straight linea greater number of objects that seek it the\r\nindividual atoma greater number of tendencies to unitya greater number\r\nof satisfactions for its own tendency to unityin a word because in the\r\ndirection of the centre lies the utmost possibility of satisfaction\r\ngenerally for its own individual appetite to be brief the\r\ncondition unity is all that is really sought and if the atoms\r\nseem to seek the centre of the sphere it is only impliedly through\r\nimplicationbecause such centre happens to imply to include or to\r\ninvolve the only essential centre unity but on account of this\r\nimplication or involution there is no possibility of practically\r\nseparating the tendency to unity in the abstract from the tendency to\r\nthe concrete centre thus the tendency of the atoms to the general\r\ncentre is to all practical intents and for all logical purposes the\r\ntendency each to each and the tendency each to each is the tendency\r\nto the centre and the one tendency may be assumed as the other\r\nwhatever will apply to the one must be thoroughly applicable to the\r\nother and in conclusion whatever principle will satisfactorily\r\nexplain the one cannot be questioned as an explanation of the other\r\n\r\nin looking carefully around me for rational objection to what i have\r\nadvanced i am able to discover nothingbut of that class of\r\nobjections usually urged by the doubters for doubts sake i very\r\nreadily perceive three and proceed to dispose of them in order\r\n\r\nit may be said first the proof that the force of irradiation in the\r\ncase described is directly proportional to the squares of the\r\ndistances depends upon an unwarranted assumptionthat of the number of\r\natoms in each stratum being the measure of the force with which they are\r\nemitted\r\n\r\ni reply not only that i am warranted in such assumption but that i\r\nshould be utterly unwarranted in any other what i assume is simply\r\nthat an effect is the measure of its causethat every exercise of the\r\ndivine will will be proportional to that which demands the exertionthat\r\nthe means of omnipotence or of omniscience will be exactly adapted to\r\nits purposes neither can a deficiency nor an excess of cause bring to\r\npass any effect had the force which irradiated any stratum to its\r\nposition been either more or less than was needed for the purposethat\r\nis to say not directly proportional to the purposethen to its\r\nposition that stratum could not have been irradiated had the force\r\nwhich with a view to general equability of distribution emitted the\r\nproper number of atoms for each stratum been not directly\r\nproportional to the number then the number would not have been the\r\nnumber demanded for the equable distribution\r\n\r\nthe second supposable objection is somewhat better entitled to an\r\nanswer\r\n\r\nit is an admitted principle in dynamics that every body on receiving an\r\nimpulse or disposition to move will move onward in a straight line in\r\nthe direction imparted by the impelling force until deflected or\r\nstopped by some other force how then it may be asked is my first or\r\nexternal stratum of atoms to be understood as discontinuing their\r\nmovement at the circumference of the imaginary glass sphere when no\r\nsecond force of more than an imaginary character appears to account\r\nfor the discontinuance\r\n\r\ni reply that the objection in this case actually does arise out of an\r\nunwarranted assumptionon the part of the objectorthe assumption of a\r\nprinciple in dynamics at an epoch when no principles in\r\nanything existi use the word principle of course in the\r\nobjectors understanding of the word\r\n\r\nin the beginning we can admitindeed we can comprehendbut one first\r\ncausethe truly ultimate principlethe volition of god the primary\r\nactthat of irradiation from unitymust have been independent of all\r\nthat which the world now calls principlebecause all that we so\r\ndesignate is but a consequence of the rëaction of that primary acti\r\nsay primary act for the creation of the absolute material particle\r\nis more properly to be regarded as a conception than as an act in\r\nthe ordinary meaning of the term thus we must regard the primary act\r\nas an act for the establishment of what we now call principles but\r\nthis primary act itself is to be considered as continuous volition\r\nthe thought of god is to be understood as originating the diffusionas\r\nproceeding with itas regulating itand finally as being withdrawn\r\nfrom it upon its completion then commences rëaction and through\r\nrëaction principle as we employ the word it will be advisable\r\nhowever to limit the application of this word to the two immediate\r\nresults of the discontinuance of the divine volitionthat is to the two\r\nagents attraction and repulsion every other natural agent depends\r\neither more or less immediately upon these two and therefore would be\r\nmore conveniently designated as subprinciple\r\n\r\nit may be objected thirdly that in general the peculiar mode of\r\ndistribution which i have suggested for the atoms is an hypothesis and\r\nnothing more\r\n\r\nnow i am aware that the word hypothesis is a ponderous sledgehammer\r\ngrasped immediately if not lifted by all very diminutive thinkers\r\nupon the first appearance of any proposition wearing in any particular\r\nthe garb of a theory but hypothesis cannot be wielded here to any\r\ngood purpose even by those who succeed in lifting itlittle men or\r\ngreat\r\n\r\ni maintain first that only in the mode described is it conceivable\r\nthat matter could have been diffused so as to fulfil at once the\r\nconditions of irradiation and of generally equable distribution i\r\nmaintain secondly that these conditions themselves have been imposed\r\nupon me as necessities in a train of ratiocination as rigorously\r\nlogical as that which establishes any demonstration in euclid and i\r\nmaintain thirdly that even if the charge of hypothesis were as fully\r\nsustained as it is in fact unsustained and untenable still the\r\nvalidity and indisputability of my result would not even in the\r\nslightest particular be disturbed\r\n\r\nto explainthe newtonian gravitya law of naturea law whose existence\r\nas such no one out of bedlam questionsa law whose admission as such\r\nenables us to account for ninetenths of the universal phænomenaa law\r\nwhich merely because it does so enable us to account for these\r\nphænomena we are perfectly willing without reference to any other\r\nconsiderations to admit and cannot help admitting as a lawa law\r\nnevertheless of which neither the principle nor the modus operandi of\r\nthe principle has ever yet been traced by the human analysisa law in\r\nshort which neither in its detail nor in its generality has been\r\nfound susceptible of explanation at allis at length seen to be at\r\nevery point thoroughly explicable provided only we yield our assent\r\ntowhat to an hypothesis why if an hypothesisif the merest\r\nhypothesisif an hypothesis for whose assumptionas in the case of that\r\npure hypothesis the newtonian law itselfno shadow of à priori\r\nreason could be assignedif an hypothesis even so absolute as all this\r\nimplies would enable us to perceive a principle for the newtonian\r\nlawwould enable us to understand as satisfied conditions so\r\nmiraculouslyso ineffably complex and seemingly irreconcileable as those\r\ninvolved in the relations of which gravity tells uswhat rational being\r\ncould so expose his fatuity as to call even this absolute hypothesis\r\nan hypothesis any longerunless indeed he were to persist in so\r\ncalling it with the understanding that he did so simply for the sake\r\nof consistency in words\r\n\r\nbut what is the true state of our present case what is the fact not\r\nonly that it is not an hypothesis which we are required to adopt\r\nin order to admit the principle at issue explained but that it is a\r\nlogical conclusion which we are requested not to adopt if we can avoid\r\nitwhich we are simply invited to deny if we cana conclusion of so\r\naccurate a logicality that to dispute it would be the effortto doubt\r\nits validity beyond our powera conclusion from which we see no mode of\r\nescape turn as we will a result which confronts us either at the end\r\nof an inductive journey from the phænomena of the very law discussed\r\nor at the close of a deductive career from the most rigorously simple\r\nof all conceivable assumptionsthe assumption in a word of simplicity\r\nitself\r\n\r\nand if here for the mere sake of cavilling it be urged that although\r\nmy startingpoint is as i assert the assumption of absolute\r\nsimplicity yet simplicity considered merely in itself is no axiom\r\nand that only deductions from axioms are indisputableit is thus that i\r\nreply\r\n\r\nevery other science than logic is the science of certain concrete\r\nrelations arithmetic for example is the science of the relations of\r\nnumbergeometry of the relations of formmathematics in general of the\r\nrelations of quantity in generalof whatever can be increased or\r\ndiminished logic however is the science of relation in the\r\nabstractof absolute relationof relation considered solely in itself\r\nan axiom in any particular science other than logic is thus merely a\r\nproposition announcing certain concrete relations which seem to be too\r\nobvious for disputeas when we say for instance that the whole is\r\ngreater than its partand thus again the principle of the logical\r\naxiomin other words of an axiom in the abstractis simply\r\nobviousness of relation now it is clear not only that what is\r\nobvious to one mind may not be obvious to another but that what is\r\nobvious to one mind at one epoch may be anything but obvious at\r\nanother epoch to the same mind it is clear moreover that what\r\ntoday is obvious even to the majority of mankind or to the majority\r\nof the best intellects of mankind may tomorrow be to either majority\r\nmore or less obvious or in no respect obvious at all it is seen then\r\nthat the axiomatic principle itself is susceptible of variation and\r\nof course that axioms are susceptible of similar change being mutable\r\nthe truths which grow out of them are necessarily mutable too or in\r\nother words are never to be positively depended upon as truths at\r\nallsince truth and immutability are one\r\n\r\nit will now be readily understood that no axiomatic ideano idea founded\r\nin the fluctuating principle obviousness of relationcan possibly be so\r\nsecureso reliable a basis for any structure erected by the reason as\r\nthat ideawhatever it is wherever we can find it or if it be\r\npracticable to find it anywherewhich is irrelative altogetherwhich\r\nnot only presents to the understanding no obviousness of relation\r\neither greater or less to be considered but subjects the intellect\r\nnot in the slightest degree to the necessity of even looking at any\r\nrelation at all if such an idea be not what we too heedlessly term an\r\naxiom it is at least preferable as a logical basis to any axiom ever\r\npropounded or to all imaginable axioms combinedand such precisely\r\nis the idea with which my deductive process so thoroughly corroborated\r\nby induction commences my particle proper is but absolute\r\nirrelation to sum up what has been here advancedas a starting point\r\ni have taken it for granted simply that the beginning had nothing\r\nbehind it or before itthat it was a beginning in factthat it was a\r\nbeginning and nothing different from a beginningin short that this\r\nbeginning wasthat which it was if this be a mere assumption then\r\na mere assumption let it be\r\n\r\nto conclude this branch of the subjecti am fully warranted in\r\nannouncing that the law which we have been in the habit of calling\r\ngravity exists on account of matters having been irradiated at its\r\norigin atomically into a limited sphere of space from one\r\nindividual unconditional irrelative and absolute particle proper by\r\nthe sole process in which it was possible to satisfy at the same time\r\nthe two conditions irradiation and generallyequable distribution\r\nthroughout the spherethat is to say by a force varying in direct\r\nproportion with the squares of the distances between the irradiated\r\natoms respectively and the particular centre of irradiation\r\n\r\n     limited spherea sphere is necessarily limited i prefer\r\n    tautology to a chance of misconception\r\n\r\ni have already given my reasons for presuming matter to have been\r\ndiffused by a determinate rather than by a continuous or infinitely\r\ncontinued force supposing a continuous force we should be unable in\r\nthe first place to comprehend a rëaction at all and we should be\r\nrequired in the second place to entertain the impossible conception of\r\nan infinite extension of matter not to dwell upon the impossibility of\r\nthe conception the infinite extension of matter is an idea which if\r\nnot positively disproved is at least not in any respect warranted by\r\ntelescopic observation of the starsa point to be explained more fully\r\nhereafter and this empirical reason for believing in the original\r\nfinity of matter is unempirically confirmed for exampleadmitting for\r\nthe moment the possibility of understanding space filled with the\r\nirradiated atomsthat is to say admitting as well as we can for\r\narguments sake that the succession of the irradiated atoms had\r\nabsolutely no endthen it is abundantly clear that even when the\r\nvolition of god had been withdrawn from them and thus the tendency to\r\nreturn into unity permitted abstractly to be satisfied this\r\npermission would have been nugatory and invalidpractically valueless\r\nand of no effect whatever no rëaction could have taken place no\r\nmovement toward unity could have been made no law of gravity could have\r\nobtained\r\n\r\nto explaingrant the abstract tendency of any one atom to any one\r\nother as the inevitable result of diffusion from the normal unityor\r\nwhat is the same thing admit any given atom as proposing to move in\r\nany given directionit is clear that since there is an infinity of\r\natoms on all sides of the atom proposing to move it never can actually\r\nmove toward the satisfaction of its tendency in the direction given on\r\naccount of a precisely equal and counterbalancing tendency in the\r\ndirection diametrically opposite in other words exactly as many\r\ntendencies to unity are behind the hesitating atom as before it for it\r\nis a mere sotticism to say that one infinite line is longer or shorter\r\nthan another infinite line or that one infinite number is greater or\r\nless than another number that is infinite thus the atom in question\r\nmust remain stationary forever under the impossible circumstances which\r\nwe have been merely endeavoring to conceive for arguments sake there\r\ncould have been no aggregation of matterno starsno worldsnothing but\r\na perpetually atomic and inconsequential universe in fact view it as\r\nwe will the whole idea of unlimited matter is not only untenable but\r\nimpossible and preposterous\r\n\r\nwith the understanding of a sphere of atoms however we perceive at\r\nonce a satisfiable tendency to union the general result of the\r\ntendency each to each being a tendency of all to the centre the\r\ngeneral process of condensation or approximation commences\r\nimmediately by a common and simultaneous movement on withdrawal of the\r\ndivine volition the individual approximations or coalescencesnot\r\ncöalitionsof atom with atom being subject to almost infinite\r\nvariations of time degree and condition on account of the excessive\r\nmultiplicity of relation arising from the differences of form assumed\r\nas characterizing the atoms at the moment of their quitting the particle\r\nproper as well as from the subsequent particular inequidistance each\r\nfrom each\r\n\r\nwhat i wish to impress upon the reader is the certainty of there\r\narising at once on withdrawal of the diffusive force or divine\r\nvolition out of the condition of the atoms as described at\r\ninnumerable points throughout the universal sphere innumerable\r\nagglomerations characterized by innumerable specific differences of\r\nform size essential nature and distance each from each the\r\ndevelopment of repulsion electricity must have commenced of course\r\nwith the very earliest particular efforts at unity and must have\r\nproceeded constantly in the ratio of coalescencethat is to say in\r\nthat of condensation or again of heterogeneity\r\n\r\nthus the two principles proper attraction and repulsionthe\r\nmaterial and the spiritualaccompany each other in the strictest\r\nfellowship forever thus the body and the soul walk hand in hand\r\n\r\nif now in fancy we select any one of the agglomerations considered\r\nas in their primary stages throughout the universal sphere and suppose\r\nthis incipient agglomeration to be taking place at that point where the\r\ncentre of our sun existsor rather where it did exist originally for\r\nthe sun is perpetually shifting his positionwe shall find ourselves\r\nmet and borne onward for a time at least by the most magnificent of\r\ntheoriesby the nebular cosmogony of laplacealthough cosmogony is\r\nfar too comprehensive a term for what he really discusseswhich is the\r\nconstitution of our solar system aloneof one among the myriad of\r\nsimilar systems which make up the universe properthat

comparatively immediate vicinityand merely\r\nassumingthat is to say assuming without any basis whatever either\r\ndeductive or inductivemuch of what i have been just endeavoring to\r\nplace upon a more stable basis than assumption assuming for example\r\nmatter as diffused without pretending to account for the diffusion\r\nthroughout and somewhat beyond the space occupied by our\r\nsystemdiffused in a state of heterogeneous nebulosity and obedient to\r\nthat omniprevalent law of gravity at whose principle he ventured to make\r\nno guessassuming all this which is quite true although he had no\r\nlogical right to its assumption laplace has shown dynamically and\r\nmathematically that the results in such case necessarily ensuing are\r\nthose and those alone which we find manifested in the actually existing\r\ncondition of the system itself\r\n\r\nto explainlet us conceive that particular agglomeration of which we\r\nhave just spokenthe one at the point designated by our suns centreto\r\nhave so far proceeded that a vast quantity of nebulous matter has here\r\nassumed a roughly globular form its centre being of course coincident\r\nwith what is now or rather was originally the centre of our sun and\r\nits periphery extending out beyond the orbit of neptune the most remote\r\nof our planetsin other words let us suppose the diameter of this\r\nrough sphere to be some  millions of miles for ages this mass of\r\nmatter has been undergoing condensation until at length it has become\r\nreduced into the bulk we imagine having proceeded gradually of course\r\nfrom its atomic and imperceptible state into what we understand of\r\nvisible palpable or otherwise appreciable nebulosity\r\n\r\nnow the condition of this mass implies a rotation about an imaginary\r\naxisa rotation which commencing with the absolute incipiency of the\r\naggregation has been ever since acquiring velocity the very first two\r\natoms which met approaching each other from points not diametrically\r\nopposite would in rushing partially past each other form a nucleus\r\nfor the rotary movement described how this would increase in velocity\r\nis readily seen the two atoms are joined by othersan aggregation is\r\nformed the mass continues to rotate while condensing but any atom at\r\nthe circumference has of course a more rapid motion than one nearer\r\nthe centre the outer atom however with its superior velocity\r\napproaches the centre carrying this superior velocity with it as it\r\ngoes thus every atom proceeding inwardly and finally attaching itself\r\nto the condensed centre adds something to the original velocity of that\r\ncentrethat is to say increases the rotary movement of the mass\r\n\r\nlet us now suppose this mass so far condensed that it occupies\r\nprecisely the space circumscribed by the orbit of neptune and that\r\nthe velocity with which the surface of the mass moves in the general\r\nrotation is precisely that velocity with which neptune now revolves\r\nabout the sun at this epoch then we are to understand that the\r\nconstantly increasing centrifugal force having gotten the better of the\r\nnonincreasing centripetal loosened and separated the exterior and\r\nleast condensed stratum or a few of the exterior and least condensed\r\nstrata at the equator of the sphere where the tangential velocity\r\npredominated so that these strata formed about the main body an\r\nindependent ring encircling the equatorial regionsjust as the exterior\r\nportion thrown off by excessive velocity of rotation from a\r\ngrindstone would form a ring about the grindstone but for the solidity\r\nof the superficial material were this caoutchouc or anything similar\r\nin consistency precisely the phænomenon i describe would be presented\r\n\r\nthe ring thus whirled from the nebulous mass revolved of course\r\nas a separate ring with just that velocity with which while the\r\nsurface of the mass it rotated in the meantime condensation still\r\nproceeding the interval between the discharged ring and the main body\r\ncontinued to increase until the former was left at a vast distance from\r\nthe latter\r\n\r\nnow admitting the ring to have possessed by some seemingly accidental\r\narrangement of its heterogeneous materials a constitution nearly\r\nuniform then this ring as such would never have ceased revolving\r\nabout its primary but as might have been anticipated there appears to\r\nhave been enough irregularity in the disposition of the materials to\r\nmake them cluster about centres of superior solidity and thus the\r\nannular form was destroyed no doubt the band was soon broken up\r\ninto several portions and one of these portions predominating in mass\r\nabsorbed the others into itself the whole settling spherically into a\r\nplanet that this latter as a planet continued the revolutionary\r\nmovement which characterized it while a ring is sufficiently clear and\r\nthat it took upon itself also an additional movement in its new\r\ncondition of sphere is readily explained the ring being understood as\r\nyet unbroken we see that its exterior while the whole revolves about\r\nthe parent body moves more rapidly than its interior when the rupture\r\noccurred then some portion in each fragment must have been moving\r\nwith greater velocity than the others the superior movement prevailing\r\nmust have whirled each fragment roundthat is to say have caused it to\r\nrotate and the direction of the rotation must of course have been the\r\ndirection of the revolution whence it arose all the fragments having\r\nbecome subject to the rotation described must in coalescing have\r\nimparted it to the one planet constituted by their coalescencethis\r\nplanet was neptune its material continuing to undergo condensation and\r\nthe centrifugal force generated in its rotation getting at length the\r\nbetter of the centripetal as before in the case of the parent orb a\r\nring was whirled also from the equatorial surface of this planet this\r\nring having been ununiform in its constitution was broken up and its\r\nseveral fragments being absorbed by the most massive were collectively\r\nspherified into a moon subsequently the operation was repeated and a\r\nsecond moon was the result we thus account for the planet neptune with\r\nthe two satellites which accompany him\r\n\r\n     laplace assumed his nebulosity heterogeneous merely that\r\n    he might be thus enabled to account for the breaking up of the\r\n    rings for had the nebulosity been homogeneous they would not\r\n    have broken i reach the same resultheterogeneity of the\r\n    secondary masses immediately resulting from the atomspurely\r\n    from an à priori consideration of their general\r\n    designrelation\r\n\r\nin throwing off a ring from its equator the sun reestablished that\r\nequilibrium between its centripetal and centrifugal forces which had\r\nbeen disturbed in the process of condensation but as this condensation\r\nstill proceeded the equilibrium was again immediately disturbed\r\nthrough the increase of rotation by the time the mass had so far shrunk\r\nthat it occupied a spherical space just that circumscribed by the orbit\r\nof uranus we are to understand that the centrifugal force had so far\r\nobtained the ascendency that new relief was needed a second equatorial\r\nband was consequently thrown off which proving ununiform was\r\nbroken up as before in the case of neptune the fragments settling into\r\nthe planet uranus the velocity of whose actual revolution about the sun\r\nindicates of course the rotary speed of that suns equatorial surface\r\nat the moment of the separation uranus adopting a rotation from the\r\ncollective rotations of the fragments composing it as previously\r\nexplained now threw off ring after ring each of which becoming broken\r\nup settled into a moonthree moons at different epochs having been\r\nformed in this manner by the rupture and general spherification of as\r\nmany distinct ununiform rings\r\n\r\nby the time the sun had shrunk until it occupied a space just that\r\ncircumscribed by the orbit of saturn the balance we are to suppose\r\nbetween its centripetal and centrifugal forces had again become so far\r\ndisturbed through increase of rotary velocity the result of\r\ncondensation that a third effort at equilibrium became necessary and\r\nan annular band was therefore whirled off as twice before which on\r\nrupture through ununiformity became consolidated into the planet\r\nsaturn this latter threw off in the first place seven uniform bands\r\nwhich on rupture were spherified respectively into as many moons but\r\nsubsequently it appears to have discharged at three distinct but not\r\nvery distant epochs three rings whose equability of constitution was\r\nby apparent accident so considerable as to present no occasion for\r\ntheir rupture thus they continue to revolve as rings i use the phrase\r\napparent accident for of accident in the ordinary sense there was\r\nof course nothingthe term is properly applied only to the result of\r\nindistinguishable or not immediately traceable law\r\n\r\nshrinking still farther until it occupied just the space circumscribed\r\nby the orbit of jupiter the sun now found need of farther effort to\r\nrestore the counterbalance of its two forces continually disarranged in\r\nthe still continued increase of rotation jupiter accordingly was now\r\nthrown off passing from the annular to the planetary condition and on\r\nattaining this latter threw off in its turn at four different epochs\r\nfour rings which finally resolved themselves into so many moons\r\n\r\nstill shrinking until its sphere occupied just the space defined by the\r\norbit of the asteroids the sun now discarded a ring which appears to\r\nhave had eight centres of superior solidity and on breaking up to\r\nhave separated into eight fragments no one of which so far predominated\r\nin mass as to absorb the others all therefore as distinct although\r\ncomparatively small planets proceeded to revolve in orbits whose\r\ndistances each from each may be considered as in some degree the\r\nmeasure of the force which drove them asunderall the orbits\r\nnevertheless being so closely coincident as to admit of our calling\r\nthem one in view of the other planetary orbits\r\n\r\ncontinuing to shrink the sun on becoming so small as just to fill the\r\norbit of mars now discharged this planetof course by the process\r\nrepeatedly described having no moon however mars could have thrown\r\noff no ring in fact an epoch had now arrived in the career of the\r\nparent body the centre of the system the decrease of its nebulosity\r\nwhich is the increase of its density and which again is the\r\ndecrease of its condensation out of which latter arose the constant\r\ndisturbance of equilibriummust by this period have attained a point\r\nat which the efforts for restoration would have been more and more\r\nineffectual just in proportion as they were less frequently needed thus\r\nthe processes of which we have been speaking would everywhere show signs\r\nof exhaustionin the planets first and secondly in the original mass\r\nwe must not fall into the error of supposing the decrease of interval\r\nobserved among the planets as we approach the sun to be in any respect\r\nindicative of an increase of frequency in the periods at which they were\r\ndiscarded exactly the converse is to be understood the longest\r\ninterval of time must have occurred between the discharges of the two\r\ninterior the shortest between those of the two exterior planets the\r\ndecrease of the interval of space is nevertheless the measure of the\r\ndensity and thus inversely of the condensation of the sun throughout\r\nthe processes detailed\r\n\r\nhaving shrunk however so far as to fill only the orbit of our earth\r\nthe parent sphere whirled from itself still one other bodythe earthin\r\na condition so nebulous as to admit of this bodys discarding in its\r\nturn yet another which is our moonbut here terminated the lunar\r\nformations\r\n\r\nfinally subsiding to the orbits first of venus and then of mercury the\r\nsun discarded these two interior planets neither of which has given\r\nbirth to any moon\r\n\r\nthus from his original bulkor to speak more accurately from the\r\ncondition in which we first considered himfrom a partially spherified\r\nnebular mass certainly much more than  millions of miles in\r\ndiameterthe great central orb and origin of our solarplanetarylunar\r\nsystem has gradually descended by condensation in obedience to the\r\nlaw of gravity to a globe only  miles in diameter but it by no\r\nmeans follows either that its condensation is yet complete or that it\r\nmay not still possess the capacity of whirling from itself another\r\nplanet\r\n\r\ni have here givenin outline of course but still with all the detail\r\nnecessary for distinctnessa view of the nebular theory as its author\r\nhimself conceived it from whatever point we regard it we shall find it\r\nbeautifully true it is by far too beautiful indeed not to possess\r\ntruth as its essentialityand here i am very profoundly serious in what\r\ni say in the revolution of the satellites of uranus there does appear\r\nsomething seemingly inconsistent with the assumptions of laplace but\r\nthat one inconsistency can invalidate a theory constructed from a\r\nmillion of intricate consistencies is a fancy fit only for the\r\nfantastic in prophecying confidently that the apparent anomaly to\r\nwhich i refer will sooner or later be found one of the strongest\r\npossible corroborations of the general hypothesis i pretend to no\r\nespecial spirit of divination it is a matter which the only difficulty\r\nseems not to foresee\r\n\r\n     i am prepared to show that the anomalous revolution of the\r\n    satellites of uranus is a simply perspective anomaly arising\r\n    from the inclination of the axis of the planet\r\n\r\nthe bodies whirled off in the processes described would exchange it\r\nhas been seen the superficial rotation of the orbs whence they\r\noriginated for a revolution of equal velocity about these orbs as\r\ndistant centres and the revolution thus engendered must proceed so\r\nlong as the centripetal force or that with which the discarded body\r\ngravitates toward its parent is neither greater nor less than that by\r\nwhich it was discarded that is than the centrifugal or far more\r\nproperly than the tangential velocity from the unity however of the\r\norigin of these two forces we might have expected to find them as they\r\nare foundthe one accurately counterbalancing the other it has been\r\nshown indeed that the act of whirlingoff is in every case merely an\r\nact for the preservation of the counterbalance\r\n\r\nafter referring however the centripetal force to the omniprevalent law\r\nof gravity it has been the fashion with astronomical treatises to seek\r\nbeyond the limits of mere naturethat is to say of secondary causea\r\nsolution of the phænomenon of tangential velocity this latter they\r\nattribute directly to a first causeto god the force which carries a\r\nstellar body around its primary they assert to have originated in an\r\nimpulse given immediately by the fingerthis is the childish phraseology\r\nemployedby the finger of deity itself in this view the planets fully\r\nformed are conceived to have been hurled from the divine hand to a\r\nposition in the vicinity of the suns with an impetus mathematically\r\nadapted to the masses or attractive capacities of the suns themselves\r\nan idea so grossly unphilosophical although so supinely adopted could\r\nhave arisen only from the difficulty of otherwise accounting for the\r\nabsolutely accurate adaptation each to each of two forces so seemingly\r\nindependent one of the other as are the gravitating and tangential\r\nbut it should be remembered that for a long time the coincidence\r\nbetween the moons rotation and her sidereal revolutiontwo matters\r\nseemingly far more independent than those now consideredwas looked\r\nupon as positively miraculous and there was a strong disposition even\r\namong astronomers to attribute the marvel to the direct and continual\r\nagency of godwho in this case it was said had found it necessary to\r\ninterpose specially among his general laws a set of subsidiary\r\nregulations for the purpose of forever concealing from mortal eyes the\r\nglories or perhaps the horrors of the other side of the moonof that\r\nmysterious hemisphere which has always avoided and must perpetually\r\navoid the telescopic scrutiny of mankind the advance of science\r\nhowever soon demonstratedwhat to the philosophical instinct needed\r\nno demonstrationthat the one movement is but a portionsomething\r\nmore even than a consequenceof the other\r\n\r\nfor my part i have no patience with fantasies at once so timorous so\r\nidle and so awkward they belong to the veriest cowardice of thought\r\nthat nature and the god of nature are distinct no thinking being can\r\nlong doubt by the former we imply merely the laws of the latter but\r\nwith the very idea of god omnipotent omniscient we entertain also\r\nthe idea of the infallibility of his laws with him there being\r\nneither past nor futurewith him all being nowdo we not insult him in\r\nsupposing his laws so contrived as not to provide for every possible\r\ncontingencyor rather what idea can we have of any possible\r\ncontingency except that it is at once a result and a manifestation of\r\nhis laws he who divesting himself of prejudice shall have the rare\r\ncourage to think absolutely for himself cannot fail to arrive in the\r\nend at the condensation of laws into lawcannot fail of reaching\r\nthe conclusion that each law of nature is dependent at all points upon\r\nall other laws and that all are but consequences of one primary\r\nexercise of the divine volition such is the principle of the cosmogony\r\nwhich with all necessary deference i here venture to suggest and to\r\nmaintain\r\n\r\nin this view it will be seen that dismissing as frivolous and even\r\nimpious the fancy of the tangential force having been imparted to the\r\nplanets immediately by the finger of god i consider this force as\r\noriginating in the rotation of the starsthis rotation as brought about\r\nby the inrushing of the primary atoms towards their respective centres\r\nof aggregationthis inrushing as the consequence of the law of\r\ngravitythis law as but the mode in which is necessarily manifested the\r\ntendency of the atoms to return into imparticularitythis tendency to\r\nreturn as but the inevitable rëaction of the first and most sublime of\r\nactsthat act by which a god selfexisting and alone existing became\r\nall things at once through dint of his volition while all things were\r\nthus constituted a portion of god\r\n\r\nthe radical assumptions of this discourse suggest to me and in fact\r\nimply certain important modifications of the nebular theory as given\r\nby laplace the efforts of the repulsive power i have considered as made\r\nfor the purpose of preventing contact among the atoms and thus as made\r\nin the ratio of the approach to contactthat is to say in the ratio of\r\ncondensation in other words electricity with its involute\r\nphænomena heat light and magnetism is to be understood as proceeding\r\nas condensation proceeds and of course inversely as density proceeds\r\nor the cessation to condense thus the sun in the process of its\r\naggregation must soon in developing repulsion have become excessively\r\nheatedperhaps incandescent and we can perceive how the operation of\r\ndiscarding its rings must have been materially assisted by the slight\r\nincrustation of its surface consequent on cooling any common experiment\r\nshows us how readily a crust of the character suggested is separated\r\nthrough heterogeneity from the interior mass but on every successive\r\nrejection of the crust the new surface would appear incandescent as\r\nbefore and the period at which it would again become so far encrusted\r\nas to be readily loosened and discharged may well be imagined as\r\nexactly coincident with that at which a new effort would be needed by\r\nthe whole mass to restore the equilibrium of its two forces\r\ndisarranged through condensation in other wordsby the time the\r\nelectric influence repulsion has prepared the surface for rejection\r\nwe are to understand that the gravitating influence attraction is\r\nprecisely ready to reject it here then as everywhere the body and\r\nthe soul walk hand in hand\r\n\r\n     see page \r\n\r\nthese ideas are empirically confirmed at all points since condensation\r\ncan never in any body be considered as absolutely at an end we are\r\nwarranted in anticipating that whenever we have an opportunity of\r\ntesting the matter we shall find indications of resident luminosity in\r\nall the stellar bodiesmoons and planets as well as suns that our\r\nmoon is strongly selfluminous we see at her every total eclipse when\r\nif not so she would disappear on the dark part of the satellite too\r\nduring her phases we often observe flashes like our own auroras and\r\nthat these latter with our various other socalled electrical\r\nphænomena without reference to any more steady radiance must give our\r\nearth a certain appearance of luminosity to an inhabitant of the moon\r\nis quite evident in fact we should regard all the phænomena referred\r\nto as mere manifestations in different moods and degrees of the\r\nearths feeblycontinued condensation\r\n\r\nif my views are tenable we should be prepared to find the newer\r\nplanetsthat is to say those nearer the sunmore luminous than those\r\nolder and more remoteand the extreme brilliancy of venus on whose\r\ndark portions during her phases the auroras are frequently visible\r\ndoes not seem to be altogether accounted for by her mere proximity to\r\nthe central orb she is no doubt vividly selfluminous although less so\r\nthan mercury while the luminosity of neptune may be comparatively\r\nnothing\r\n\r\nadmitting what i have urged it is clear that from the moment of the\r\nsuns discarding a ring there must be a continuous diminution both of\r\nhis heat and light on account of the continuous encrustation of his\r\nsurface and that a period would arrivethe period immediately previous\r\nto a new dischargewhen a very material decrease of both light and\r\nheat must become apparent now we know that tokens of such changes are\r\ndistinctly recognizable on the melville islandsto adduce merely one\r\nout of a hundred exampleswe find traces of ultratropical\r\nvegetationof plants that never could have flourished without immensely\r\nmore light and heat than are at present afforded by our sun to any\r\nportion of the surface of the earth is such vegetation referable to an\r\nepoch immediately subsequent to the whirlingoff of venus at this epoch\r\nmust have occurred to us our greatest access of solar influence and\r\nin fact this influence must then have attained its maximumleaving out\r\nof view of course the period when the earth itself was discardedthe\r\nperiod of its mere organization\r\n\r\nagainwe know that there exist nonluminous sunsthat is to say suns\r\nwhose existence we determine through the movements of others but whose\r\nluminosity is not sufficient to impress us are these suns invisible\r\nmerely on account of the length of time elapsed since their discharge of\r\na planet and yet againmay we notat least in certain casesaccount\r\nfor the sudden appearances of suns where none had been previously\r\nsuspected by the hypothesis that having rolled with encrusted surfaces\r\nthroughout the few thousand years of our astronomical history each of\r\nthese suns in whirling off a new secondary has at length been enabled\r\nto display the glories of its still incandescent interiorto the\r\nwellascertained fact of the proportional increase of heat as we descend\r\ninto the earth i need of course do nothing more than referit comes\r\nin the strongest possible corroboration of all that i have said on the\r\ntopic now at issue\r\n\r\nin speaking not long ago of the repulsive or electrical influence i\r\nremarked that the important phænomena of vitality consciousness and\r\nthought whether we observe them generally or in detail seem to proceed\r\nat least in the ratio of the heterogeneous i mentioned too that\r\ni would recur to the suggestionand this is the proper point at which\r\nto do so looking at the matter first in detail we perceive that not\r\nmerely the manifestation of vitality but its importance consequence\r\nand elevation of character keep pace very closely with the\r\nheterogeneity or complexity of the animal structure looking at the\r\nquestion now in its generality and referring to the first movements\r\nof the atoms towards massconstitution we find that heterogeneousness\r\nbrought about directly through condensation is proportional with it\r\nforever we thus reach the proposition that the importance of the\r\ndevelopment of the terrestrial vitality proceeds equably with the\r\nterrestrial condensation\r\n\r\n     page \r\n\r\nnow this is in precise accordance with what we know of the succession of\r\nanimals on the earth as it has proceeded in its condensation superior\r\nand still superior races have appeared is it impossible that the\r\nsuccessive geological revolutions which have attended at least if not\r\nimmediately caused these successive elevations of vitalic characteris\r\nit improbable that these revolutions have themselves been produced by\r\nthe successive planetary discharges from the sunin other words by the\r\nsuccessive variations in the solar influence on the earth were this\r\nidea tenable we should not be unwarranted in the fancy that the\r\ndischarge of yet a new planet interior to mercury may give rise to yet\r\na new modification of the terrestrial surfacea modification from which\r\nmay spring a race both materially and spiritually superior to man these\r\nthoughts impress me with all the force of truthbut i throw them out of\r\ncourse merely in their obvious character of suggestion\r\n\r\nthe nebular theory of laplace has lately received far more confirmation\r\nthan it needed at the hands of the philosopher compte these two have\r\nthus together shownnot to be sure that matter at any period\r\nactually existed as described in a state of nebular diffusion but\r\nthat admitting it so to have existed throughout the space and much\r\nbeyond the space now occupied by our solar system and to have\r\ncommenced a movement towards a centreit must gradually have assumed\r\nthe various forms and motions which are now seen in that system to\r\nobtain a demonstration such as thisa dynamical and mathematical\r\ndemonstration as far as demonstration can beunquestionable and\r\nunquestionedunless indeed by that unprofitable and disreputable\r\ntribe the professional questionersthe mere madmen who deny the\r\nnewtonian law of gravity on which the results of the french\r\nmathematicians are baseda demonstration i say such as this would to\r\nmost intellects be conclusiveand i confess that it is so to mineof the\r\nvalidity of the nebular hypothesis upon which the demonstration depends\r\n\r\nthat the demonstration does not prove the hypothesis according to the\r\ncommon understanding of the word proof i admit of course to show\r\nthat certain existing resultsthat certain established factsmay be\r\neven mathematically accounted for by the assumption of a certain\r\nhypothesis is by no means to establish the hypothesis itself in other\r\nwordsto show that certain data being given a certain existing result\r\nmight or even must have ensued will fail to prove that this result\r\ndid ensue from the data until such time as it shall be also shown\r\nthat there are and can be no other data from which the result in\r\nquestion might equally have ensued but in the case now discussed\r\nalthough all must admit the deficiency of what we are in the habit of\r\nterming proof still there are many intellects and those of the\r\nloftiest order to which no proof could bring one iota of additional\r\nconviction without going into details which might impinge upon the\r\ncloudland of metaphysics i may as well here observe that the force of\r\nconviction in cases such as this will always with the rightthinking\r\nbe proportional to the amount of complexity intervening between the\r\nhypothesis and the result to be less abstractthe greatness of the\r\ncomplexity found existing among cosmical conditions by rendering great\r\nin the same proportion the difficulty of accounting for all these\r\nconditions at once strengthens also in the same proportion our\r\nfaith in that hypothesis which does in such manner satisfactorily\r\naccount for themand as no complexity can well be conceived greater\r\nthan that of the astronomical conditions so no conviction can be\r\nstrongerto my mind at leastthan that with which i am impressed by an\r\nhypothesis that not only reconciles these conditions with mathematical\r\naccuracy and reduces them into a consistent and intelligible whole but\r\nis at the same time the sole hypothesis by means of which the human\r\nintellect has been ever enabled to account for them at all\r\n\r\na most unfounded opinion has become latterly current in gossiping and\r\neven in scientific circlesthe opinion that the socalled nebular\r\ncosmogony has been overthrown this fancy has arisen from the report of\r\nlate observations made among what hitherto have been termed the\r\nnebulæ through the large telescope of cincinnati and the\r\nworldrenowned instrument of lord rosse certain spots in the firmament\r\nwhich presented even to the most powerful of the old telescopes the\r\nappearance of nebulosity or haze had been regarded for a long time as\r\nconfirming the theory of laplace they were looked upon as stars in that\r\nvery process of condensation which i have been attempting to describe\r\nthus it was supposed that we had ocular evidencean evidence by the\r\nway which has always been found very questionableof the truth of the\r\nhypothesis and although certain telescopic improvements every now and\r\nthen enabled us to perceive that a spot here and there which we had\r\nbeen classing among the nebulæ was in fact but a cluster of stars\r\nderiving its nebular character only from its immensity of distancestill\r\nit was thought that no doubt could exist as to the actual nebulosity of\r\nnumerous other masses the strongholds of the nebulists bidding\r\ndefiance to every effort at segregation of these latter the most\r\ninteresting was the great nebulæ in the constellation orionbut this\r\nwith innumerable other miscalled nebulæ when viewed through the\r\nmagnificent modern telescopes has become resolved into a simple\r\ncollection of stars now this fact has been very generally understood as\r\nconclusive against the nebular hypothesis of laplace and on\r\nannouncement of the discoveries in question the most enthusiastic\r\ndefender and most eloquent popularizer of the theory dr nichol went\r\nso far as to admit the necessity of abandoning an idea which had\r\nformed the material of his most praiseworthy book\r\n\r\n     views of the architecture of the heavens a letter\r\n    purporting to be from dr nichol to a friend in america went\r\n    the rounds of our newspapers about two years ago i think\r\n    admitting the necessity to which i refer in a subsequent\r\n    lecture however dr n appears in some manner to have gotten\r\n    the better of the necessity and does not quite renounce the\r\n    theory although he seems to wish that he could sneer at it as\r\n    a purely hypothetical one what else was the law of gravity\r\n    before the maskelyne experiments and who questioned the law of\r\n    gravity even then\r\n\r\nmany of my readers will no doubt be inclined to say that the result of\r\nthese new investigations has at least a strong tendency to overthrow\r\nthe hypothesis while some of them more thoughtful will suggest that\r\nalthough the theory is by no means disproved through the segregation of\r\nthe particular nebulæ alluded to still a failure to segregate\r\nthem with such telescopes might well have been understood as a\r\ntriumphant corroboration of the theoryand this latter class will be\r\nsurprised perhaps to hear me say that even with them i disagree if\r\nthe propositions of this discourse have been comprehended it will be\r\nseen that in my view a failure to segregate the nebulæ would have\r\ntended to the refutation rather than to the confirmation of the\r\nnebular hypothesis\r\n\r\nlet me explainthe newtonian law of gravity we may of course assume\r\nas demonstrated this law it will be remembered i have referred to the\r\nrëaction of the first divine actto the rëaction of an exercise of the\r\ndivine volition temporarily overcoming a difficulty this difficulty is\r\nthat of forcing the normal into the abnormalof impelling that whose\r\noriginality and therefore whose rightful condition was one to take\r\nupon itself the wrongful condition of many it is only by conceiving\r\nthis difficulty as temporarily overcome that we can comprehend a\r\nrëaction there could have been no rëaction had the act been infinitely\r\ncontinued so long as the act lasted no rëaction of course could\r\ncommence in other words no gravitation could take placefor we have\r\nconsidered the one as but the manifestation of the other but\r\ngravitation has taken place therefore the act of creation has ceased\r\nand gravitation has long ago taken place therefore the act of creation\r\nhas long ago ceased we can no more expect then to observe the\r\nprimary processes of creation and to these primary processes the\r\ncondition of nebulosity has already been explained to belong\r\n\r\nthrough what we know of the propagation of light we have direct proof\r\nthat the more remote of the stars have existed under the forms in which\r\nwe now see them for an inconceivable number of years so far back at\r\nleast then as the period when these stars underwent condensation\r\nmust have been the epoch at which the massconstitutive processes began\r\nthat we may conceive these processes then as still going on in the\r\ncase of certain nebulæ while in all other cases we find them\r\nthoroughly at an end we are forced into assumptions for which we have\r\nreally no basis whateverwe have to thrust in again upon the\r\nrevolting reason the blasphemous idea of special interpositionwe have\r\nto suppose that in the particular instances of these nebulæ an\r\nunerring god found it necessary to introduce certain supplementary\r\nregulationscertain improvements of the general lawcertain retouchings\r\nand emendations in a word which had the effect of deferring the\r\ncompletion of these individual stars for centuries of centuries beyond\r\nthe æra during which all the other stellar bodies had time not only to\r\nbe fully constituted but to grow hoary with an unspeakable old age\r\n\r\nof course it will be immediately objected that since the light by which\r\nwe recognize the nebulæ now must be merely that which left their\r\nsurfaces a vast number of years ago the processes at present observed\r\nor supposed to be observed are in fact not processes now actually\r\ngoing on but the phantoms of processes completed long in the pastjust\r\nas i maintain all these massconstitutive processes must have been\r\n\r\nto this i reply that neither is the nowobserved condition of the\r\ncondensed stars their actual condition but a condition completed long\r\nin the past so that my argument drawn from the relative condition of\r\nthe stars and the nebulæ is in no manner disturbed moreover those\r\nwho maintain the existence of nebulæ do not refer the nebulosity to\r\nextreme distance they declare it a real and not merely a perspective\r\nnebulosity that we may conceive indeed a nebular mass as visible at\r\nall we must conceive it as very near us in comparison with the\r\ncondensed stars brought into view by the modern telescopes in\r\nmaintaining the appearances in question then to be really nebulous we\r\nmaintain their comparative vicinity to our point of view thus their\r\ncondition as we see them now must be referred to an epoch far less\r\nremote than that to which we may refer the nowobserved condition of at\r\nleast the majority of the starsin a word should astronomy ever\r\ndemonstrate a nebula in the sense at present intended i should\r\nconsider the nebular cosmogonynot indeed as corroborated by the\r\ndemonstrationbut as thereby irretrievably overthrown\r\n\r\nby way however of rendering unto cæsar no more than the things that\r\nare cæsars let me here remark that the assumption of the hypothesis\r\nwhich led him to so glorious a result seems to have been suggested to\r\nlaplace in great measure by a misconceptionby the very misconception of\r\nwhich we have just been speakingby the generally prevalent\r\nmisunderstanding of the character of the nebulæ so misnamed these he\r\nsupposed to be in reality what their designation implies the fact is\r\nthis great man had very properly an inferior faith in his own merely\r\nperceptive powers in respect therefore to the actual existence of\r\nnebulæan existence so confidently maintained by his telescopic\r\ncontemporarieshe depended less upon what he saw than upon what he\r\nheard\r\n\r\nit will be seen that the only valid objections to his theory are those\r\nmade to its hypothesis as suchto what suggested itnot to what it\r\nsuggests to its propositions rather than to its results his most\r\nunwarranted assumption was that of giving the atoms a movement towards a\r\ncentre in the very face of his evident understanding that these atoms\r\nin unlimited succession extended throughout the universal space i have\r\nalready shown that under such circumstances there could have occurred\r\nno movement at all and laplace consequently assumed one on no more\r\nphilosophical ground than that something of the kind was necessary for\r\nthe establishment of what he intended to establish\r\n\r\nhis original idea seems to have been a compound of the true epicurean\r\natoms with the false nebulæ of his contemporaries and thus his theory\r\npresents us with the singular anomaly of absolute truth deduced as a\r\nmathematical result from a hybrid datum of ancient imagination\r\nintertangled with modern inacumen laplaces real strength lay in fact\r\nin an almost miraculous mathematical instincton this he relied and in\r\nno instance did it fail or deceive himin the case of the nebular\r\ncosmogony it led him blindfolded through a labyrinth of error into\r\none of the most luminous and stupendous temples of truth\r\n\r\nlet us now fancy for the moment that the ring first thrown off by the\r\nsunthat is to say the ring whose breakingup constituted neptunedid\r\nnot in fact break up until the throwingoff of the ring out of which\r\nuranus arose that this latter ring again remained perfect until the\r\ndischarge of that out of which sprang saturn that this latter again\r\nremained entire until the discharge of that from which originated\r\njupiterand so on let us imagine in a word that no dissolution\r\noccurred among the rings until the final rejection of that which gave\r\nbirth to mercury we thus paint to the eye of the mind a series of\r\ncöexistent concentric circles and looking as well at them as at the\r\nprocesses by which according to laplaces hypothesis they were\r\nconstructed we perceive at once a very singular analogy with the atomic\r\nstrata and the process of the original irradiation as i have described\r\nit is it impossible that on measuring the forces respectively by\r\nwhich each successive planetary circle was thrown offthat is to say on\r\nmeasuring the successive excesses of rotation over gravitation which\r\noccasioned the successive dischargeswe should find the analogy in\r\nquestion more decidedly confirmed is it improbable that we should\r\ndiscover these forces to have variedas in the original\r\nradiationproportionally to the squares of the distances\r\n\r\nour solar system consisting in chief of one sun with sixteen planets\r\ncertainly and possibly a few more revolving about it at various\r\ndistances and attended by seventeen moons assuredly but very\r\nprobably by several othersis now to be considered as an example of\r\nthe innumerable agglomerations which proceeded to take place throughout\r\nthe universal sphere of atoms on withdrawal of the divine volition i\r\nmean to say that our solar system is to be understood as affording a\r\ngeneric instance of these agglomerations or more correctly of the\r\nulterior conditions at which they arrived if we keep our attention\r\nfixed on the idea of the utmost possible relation as the omnipotent\r\ndesign and on the precautions taken to accomplish it through difference\r\nof form among the original atoms and particular inequidistance we\r\nshall find it impossible to suppose for a moment that even any two of\r\nthe incipient agglomerations reached precisely the same result in the\r\nend we shall rather be inclined to think that no two stellar bodies\r\nin the universewhether suns planets or moonsare particularly while\r\nall are generally similar still less then can we imagine any two\r\nassemblages of such bodiesany two systemsas having more than a\r\ngeneral resemblance our telescopes at this point thoroughly\r\nconfirm our deductions taking our own solar system then as merely a\r\nloose or general type of all we have so far proceeded in our subject as\r\nto survey the universe under the aspect of a spherical space throughout\r\nwhich dispersed with merely general equability exist a number of but\r\ngenerally similar systems\r\n\r\n     it is not impossible that some unlookedfor optical\r\n    improvement may disclose to us among innumerable varieties of\r\n    systems a luminous sun encircled by luminous and nonluminous\r\n    rings within and without and between which revolve luminous\r\n    and nonluminous planets attended by moons having moonsand\r\n    even these latter again having moons\r\n\r\nlet us now expanding our conceptions look upon each of these systems\r\nas in itself an atom which in fact it is when we consider it as but\r\none of the countless myriads of systems which constitute the universe\r\nregarding all then as but colossal atoms each with the same\r\nineradicable tendency to unity which characterizes the actual atoms of\r\nwhich it consistswe enter at once upon a new order of aggregations the\r\nsmaller systems in the vicinity of a larger one would inevitably be\r\ndrawn into still closer vicinity a thousand would assemble here a\r\nmillion thereperhaps here again even a billionleaving thus\r\nimmeasurable vacancies in space and if now it be demanded why in the\r\ncase of these systemsof these merely titanic atomsi speak simply of\r\nan assemblage and not as in the case of the actual atoms of a more\r\nor less consolidated agglomerationif it be asked for instance why i\r\ndo not carry what i suggest to its legitimate conclusion and describe\r\nat once these assemblages of systematoms as rushing to consolidation\r\nin spheresas each becoming condensed into one magnificent sunmy reply\r\nis that μελλοντα ταυταi am but pausing for a moment on the awful\r\nthreshold of the future for the present calling these assemblages\r\nclusters we see them in the incipient stages of their consolidation\r\ntheir absolute consolidation is to come\r\n\r\nwe have now reached a point from which we behold the universe as a\r\nspherical space interspersed unequably with clusters it will be\r\nnoticed that i here prefer the adverb unequably to the phrase with a\r\nmerely general equability employed before it is evident in fact\r\nthat the equability of distribution will diminish in the ratio of the\r\nagglomerative processesthat is to say as the things distributed\r\ndiminish in number thus the increase of inequabilityan increase\r\nwhich must continue until sooner or later an epoch will arrive at\r\nwhich the largest agglomeration will absorb all the othersshould be\r\nviewed as simply a corroborative indication of the tendency to one\r\n\r\nand here at length it seems proper to inquire whether the ascertained\r\nfacts of astronomy confirm the general arrangement which i have thus\r\ndeductively assigned to the heavens thoroughly they do telescopic\r\nobservation guided by the laws of perspective enables us to understand\r\nthat the perceptible universe exists as a cluster of clusters\r\nirregularly disposed\r\n\r\nthe clusters of which this universal cluster of clusters consists\r\nare merely what we have been in the practice of designating\r\nnebulæand of these nebulæ one is of paramount interest to\r\nmankind i allude to the galaxy or milky way this interests us first\r\nand most obviously on account of its great superiority in apparent\r\nsize not only to any one other cluster in the firmament but to all the\r\nother clusters taken together the largest of these latter occupies a\r\nmere point comparatively and is distinctly seen only with the aid of a\r\ntelescope the galaxy sweeps throughout the heaven and is brilliantly\r\nvisible to the naked eye but it interests man chiefly although less\r\nimmediately on account of its being his home the home of the earth on\r\nwhich he exists the home of the sun about which this earth revolves\r\nthe home of that system of orbs of which the sun is the centre and\r\nprimarythe earth one of sixteen secondaries or planetsthe moon one of\r\nseventeen tertiaries or satellites the galaxy let me repeat is but\r\none of the clusters which i have been describingbut one of the\r\nmiscalled nebulæ revealed to usby the telescope alone sometimesas\r\nfaint hazy spots in various quarters of the sky we have no reason to\r\nsuppose the milky way really more extensive than the least of these\r\nnebulæ its vast superiority in size is but an apparent superiority\r\narising from our position in regard to itthat is to say from our\r\nposition in its midst however strange the assertion may at first appear\r\nto those unversed in astronomy still the astronomer himself has no\r\nhesitation in asserting that we are in the midst of that inconceivable\r\nhost of starsof sunsof systemswhich constitute the galaxy moreover\r\nnot only have wenot only has our sun a right to claim the galaxy as\r\nits own especial cluster but with slight reservation it may be said\r\nthat all the distinctly visible stars of the firmamentall the stars\r\nvisible to the naked eyehave equally a right to claim it as their\r\nown\r\n\r\nthere has been a great deal of misconception in respect to the shape\r\nof the galaxy which in nearly all our astronomical treatises is said\r\nto resemble that of a capital y the cluster in question has in\r\nreality a certain generalvery general resemblance to the planet\r\nsaturn with its encompassing triple ring instead of the solid orb of\r\nthat planet however we must picture to ourselves a lenticular\r\nstarisland or collection of stars our sun lying excentricallynear\r\nthe shore of the islandon that side of it which is nearest the\r\nconstellation of the cross and farthest from that of cassiopeia the\r\nsurrounding ring where it approaches our position has in it a\r\nlongitudinal gash which does in fact cause the ring in our\r\nvicinity to assume loosely the appearance of a capital y\r\n\r\nwe must not fall into the error however of conceiving the somewhat\r\nindefinite girdle as at all remote comparatively speaking from the\r\nalso indefinite lenticular cluster which it surrounds and thus for\r\nmere purpose of explanation we may speak of our sun as actually\r\nsituated at that point of the y where its three component lines unite\r\nand conceiving this letter to be of a certain solidityof a certain\r\nthickness very trivial in comparison with its lengthwe may even speak\r\nof our position as in the middle of this thickness fancying ourselves\r\nthus placed we shall no longer find difficulty in accounting for the\r\nphænomena presentedwhich are perspective altogether when we look\r\nupward or downwardthat is to say when we cast our eyes in the\r\ndirection of the letters thicknesswe look through fewer stars than\r\nwhen we cast them in the direction of its length or along either of\r\nthe three component lines of course in the former case the stars\r\nappear scatteredin the latter crowdedto reverse this explanationan\r\ninhabitant of the earth when looking as we commonly express ourselves\r\nat the galaxy is then beholding it in some of the directions of its\r\nlengthis looking along the lines of the ybut when looking out into\r\nthe general heaven he turns his eyes from the galaxy he is then\r\nsurveying it in the direction of the letters thickness and on this\r\naccount the stars seem to him scattered while in fact they are as\r\nclose together on an average as in the mass of the cluster no\r\nconsideration could be better adapted to convey an idea of this\r\nclusters stupendous extent\r\n\r\nif with a telescope of high spacepenetrating power we carefully\r\ninspect the firmament we shall become aware of a belt of clustersof\r\nwhat we have hitherto called nebulæa band of varying breadth\r\nstretching from horizon to horizon at right angles to the general\r\ncourse of the milky way this band is the ultimate cluster of\r\nclusters this belt is the universe our galaxy is but one and\r\nperhaps one of the most inconsiderable of the clusters which go to the\r\nconstitution of this ultimate universal belt or band the\r\nappearance of this cluster of clusters to our eyes as a belt or\r\nband is altogether a perspective phænomenon of the same character as\r\nthat which causes us to behold our own individual and roughlyspherical\r\ncluster the galaxy under guise also of a belt traversing the heavens\r\nat right angles to the universal one the shape of the allinclusive\r\ncluster is of course generally that of each individual cluster which\r\nit includes just as the scattered stars which on looking from the\r\ngalaxy we see in the general sky are in fact but a portion of that\r\ngalaxy itself and as closely intermingled with it as any of the\r\ntelescopic points in what seems the densest portion of its massso are\r\nthe scattered nebulæ which on casting our eyes from the universal\r\nbelt we perceive at all points of the firmamentso i say are these\r\nscattered nebulæ to be understood as only perspectively scattered and\r\nas part and parcel of the one supreme and universal sphere\r\n\r\nno astronomical fallacy is more untenable and none has been more\r\npertinaciously adhered to than that of the absolute illimitation of\r\nthe universe of stars the reasons for limitation as i have already\r\nassigned them à priori seem to me unanswerable but not to speak of\r\nthese observation assures us that there is in numerous directions\r\naround us certainly if not in all a positive limitor at the very\r\nleast affords us no basis whatever for thinking otherwise were the\r\nsuccession of stars endless then the background of the sky would\r\npresent us an uniform luminosity like that displayed by the\r\ngalaxysince there could be absolutely no point in all that\r\nbackground at which would not exist a star the only mode therefore\r\nin which under such a state of affairs we could comprehend the voids\r\nwhich our telescopes find in innumerable directions would be by\r\nsupposing the distance of the invisible background so immense that no\r\nray from it has yet been able to reach us at all that this may be so\r\nwho shall venture to deny i maintain simply that we have not even the\r\nshadow of a reason for believing that it is so\r\n\r\nwhen speaking of the vulgar propensity to regard all bodies on the earth\r\nas tending merely to the earths centre i observed that with certain\r\nexceptions to be specified hereafter every body on the earth tended not\r\nonly to the earths centre but in every conceivable direction\r\nbesides the exceptions refer to those frequent gaps in the\r\nheavens where our utmost scrutiny can detect not only no stellar\r\nbodies but no indications of their existencewhere yawning chasms\r\nblacker than erebus seem to afford us glimpses through the boundary\r\nwalls of the universe of stars into the illimitable universe of\r\nvacancy beyond now as any body existing on the earth chances to\r\npass either through its own movement or the earths into a line with\r\nany one of these voids or cosmical abysses it clearly is no longer\r\nattracted in the direction of that void and for the moment\r\nconsequently is heavier than at any period either after or before\r\nindependently of the consideration of these voids however and looking\r\nonly at the generally unequable distribution of the stars we see that\r\nthe absolute tendency of bodies on the earth to the earths centre is\r\nin a state of perpetual variation\r\n\r\n     page \r\n\r\nwe comprehend then the insulation of our universe we perceive the\r\nisolation of thatof all that which we grasp with the senses we\r\nknow that there exists one cluster of clustersa collection around\r\nwhich on all sides extend the immeasurable wildernesses of a space to\r\nall human perception untenanted but because upon the confines of\r\nthis universe of stars we are compelled to pause through want of\r\nfarther evidence from the senses is it right to conclude that in fact\r\nthere is no material point beyond that which we have thus been\r\npermitted to attain have we or have we not an analogical right to the\r\ninference that this perceptible universethat this cluster of\r\nclustersis but one of a series of clusters of clusters the rest of\r\nwhich are invisible through distancethrough the diffusion of their\r\nlight being so excessive ere it reaches us as not to produce upon our\r\nretinas a lightimpressionor from there being no such emanation as\r\nlight at all in these unspeakably distant worldsor lastly from the\r\nmere interval being so vast that the electric tidings of their presence\r\nin space have not yetthrough the lapsing myriads of yearsbeen enabled\r\nto traverse that interval\r\n\r\nhave we any right to inferenceshave we any ground whatever for visions\r\nsuch as these if we have a right to them in any degree we have a\r\nright to their infinite extension\r\n\r\nthe human brain has obviously a leaning to the infinite and fondles\r\nthe phantom of the idea it seems to long with a passionate fervor for\r\nthis impossible conception with the hope of intellectually believing it\r\nwhen conceived what is general among the whole race of man of course\r\nno individual of that race can be warranted in considering abnormal\r\nnevertheless there may be a class of superior intelligences to whom\r\nthe human bias alluded to may wear all the character of monomania\r\n\r\nmy question however remains unansweredhave we any right to inferlet\r\nus say rather to imaginean interminable succession of the clusters\r\nof clusters or of universes more or less similar\r\n\r\ni reply that the right in a case such as this depends absolutely\r\nupon the hardihood of that imagination which ventures to claim the\r\nright let me declare only that as an individual i myself feel\r\nimpelled to the fancywithout daring to call it morethat there does\r\nexist a limitless succession of universes more or less similar to\r\nthat of which we have cognizanceto that of which alone we shall ever\r\nhave cognizanceat the very least until the return of our own particular\r\nuniverse into unity if such clusters of clusters exist howeverand\r\nthey doit is abundantly clear that having had no part in our origin\r\nthey have no portion in our laws they neither attract us nor we them\r\ntheir materialtheir spirit is not oursis not that which obtains in any\r\npart of our universe they could not impress our senses or our souls\r\namong them and usconsidering all for the moment collectivelythere\r\nare no influences in common each exists apart and independently in\r\nthe bosom of its proper and particular god\r\n\r\nin the conduct of this discourse i am aiming less at physical than at\r\nmetaphysical order the clearness with which even material phænomena are\r\npresented to the understanding depends very little i have long since\r\nlearned to perceive upon a merely natural and almost altogether upon a\r\nmoral arrangement if then i seem to step somewhat too discursively\r\nfrom point to point of my topic let me suggest that i do so in the hope\r\nof thus the better keeping unbroken that chain of graduated impression\r\nby which alone the intellect of man can expect to encompass the\r\ngrandeurs of which i speak and in their majestic totality to\r\ncomprehend them\r\n\r\nso far our attention has been directed almost exclusively to a\r\ngeneral and relative grouping of the stellar bodies in space of\r\nspecification there has been little and whatever ideas of quantity\r\nhave been conveyedthat is to say of number magnitude and\r\ndistancehave been conveyed incidentally and by way of preparation for\r\nmore definitive conceptions these latter let us now attempt to\r\nentertain\r\n\r\nour solar system as has been already mentioned consists in chief of\r\none sun and sixteen planets certainly but in all probability a few\r\nothers revolving around it as a centre and attended by seventeen moons\r\nof which we know with possibly several more of which as yet we know\r\nnothing these various bodies are not true spheres but oblate\r\nspheroidsspheres flattened at the poles of the imaginary axes about\r\nwhich they rotatethe flattening being a consequence of the rotation\r\nneither is the sun absolutely the centre of the system for this sun\r\nitself with all the planets revolves about a perpetually shifting\r\npoint of space which is the systems general centre of gravity neither\r\nare we to consider the paths through which these different spheroids\r\nmovethe moons about the planets the planets about the sun or the sun\r\nabout the common centreas circles in an accurate sense they are in\r\nfact ellipsesone of the foci being the point about which the\r\nrevolution is made an ellipse is a curve returning into itself one\r\nof whose diameters is longer than the other in the longer diameter are\r\ntwo points equidistant from the middle of the line and so situated\r\notherwise that if from each of them a straight line be drawn to any one\r\npoint of the curve the two lines taken together will be equal to the\r\nlonger diameter itself now let us conceive such an ellipse at one of\r\nthe points mentioned which are the foci let us fasten an orange by\r\nan elastic thread let us connect this orange with a pea and let us\r\nplace this latter on the circumference of the ellipse let us now move\r\nthe pea continuously around the orangekeeping always on the\r\ncircumference of the ellipse the elastic thread which of course\r\nvaries in length as we move the pea will form what in geometry is\r\ncalled a radius vector now if the orange be understood as the sun\r\nand the pea as a planet revolving about it then the revolution should\r\nbe made at such a ratewith a velocity so varyingthat the radius\r\nvector may pass over equal areas of space in equal times the\r\nprogress of the pea should bein other words the progress of the\r\nplanet is of courseslow in proportion to its distance from the\r\nsunswift in proportion to its proximity those planets moreover move\r\nthe more slowly which are the farther from the sun the squares of\r\ntheir periods of revolution having the same proportion to each other as\r\nhave to each other the cubes of their mean distances from the sun\r\n\r\nthe wonderfully complex laws of revolution here described however are\r\nnot to be understood as obtaining in our system alone they everywhere\r\nprevail where attraction prevails they control the universe every\r\nshining speck in the firmament is no doubt a luminous sun resembling\r\nour own at least in its general features and having in attendance upon\r\nit a greater or less number of planets greater or less whose still\r\nlingering luminosity is not sufficient to render them visible to us at\r\nso vast a distance but which nevertheless revolve moonattended\r\nabout their starry centres in obedience to the principles just\r\ndetailedin obedience to the three omniprevalent laws of revolutionthe\r\nthree immortal laws guessed by the imaginative kepler and but\r\nsubsequently demonstrated and accounted for by the patient and\r\nmathematical newton among a tribe of philosophers who pride themselves\r\nexcessively upon matteroffact it is far too fashionable to sneer at\r\nall speculation under the comprehensive sobriquet guesswork the\r\npoint to be considered is who guesses in guessing with plato we\r\nspend our time to better purpose now and then than in hearkening to a\r\ndemonstration by alcmæon\r\n\r\nin many works on astronomy i find it distinctly stated that the laws of\r\nkepler are the basis of the great principle gravitation this idea\r\nmust have arisen from the fact that the suggestion of these laws by\r\nkepler and his proving them à posteriori to have an actual existence\r\nled newton to account for them by the hypothesis of gravitation and\r\nfinally to demonstrate them à priori as necessary consequences of\r\nthe hypothetical principle thus so far from the laws of kepler being\r\nthe basis of gravity gravity is the basis of these lawsas it is\r\nindeed of all the laws of the material universe which are not referable\r\nto repulsion alone\r\n\r\nthe mean distance of the earth from the moonthat is to say from the\r\nheavenly body in our closest vicinityis  miles mercury the\r\nplanet nearest the sun is distant from him  millions of miles venus\r\nthe next revolves at a distance of  millionsthe earth which comes\r\nnext at a distance of  millionsmars then at a distance of \r\nmillions now come the eight asteroids ceres juno vesta pallas\r\nastræa flora iris and hebe at an average distance of about \r\nmillions then we have jupiter distant  millions then saturn \r\nmillions then uranus  hundred millions finally neptune lately\r\ndiscovered and revolving at a distance say of  hundred millions\r\nleaving neptune out of the accountof which as yet we know little\r\naccurately and which is possibly one of a system of asteroidsit will\r\nbe seen that within certain limits there exists an order of interval\r\namong the planets speaking loosely we may say that each outer planet\r\nis twice as far from the sun as is the next inner one may not the\r\norder here mentionedmay not the law of bodebe deduced from\r\nconsideration of the analogy suggested by me as having place between the\r\nsolar discharge of rings and the mode of the atomic irradiation\r\n\r\nthe numbers hurriedly mentioned in this summary of distance it is folly\r\nto attempt comprehending unless in the light of abstract arithmetical\r\nfacts they are not practically tangible ones they convey no precise\r\nideas i have stated that neptune the planet farthest from the sun\r\nrevolves about him at a distance of  hundred millions of miles so far\r\ngoodi have stated a mathematical fact and without comprehending it\r\nin the least we may put it to usemathematically but in mentioning\r\neven that the moon revolves about the earth at the comparatively\r\ntrifling distance of  miles i entertained no expectation of\r\ngiving any one to understandto knowto feelhow far from the earth the\r\nmoon actually is  miles there are perhaps few of my\r\nreaders who have not crossed the atlantic ocean yet how many of them\r\nhave a distinct idea of even the  miles intervening between shore\r\nand shore i doubt indeed whether the man lives who can force into his\r\nbrain the most remote conception of the interval between one milestone\r\nand its next neighbor upon the turnpike we are in some measure aided\r\nhowever in our consideration of distance by combining this\r\nconsideration with the kindred one of velocity sound passes through\r\n feet of space in a second of time now were it possible for an\r\ninhabitant of the earth to see the flash of a cannon discharged in the\r\nmoon and to hear the report he would have to wait after perceiving\r\nthe former more than  entire days and nights before getting any\r\nintimation of the latter\r\n\r\nhowever feeble be the impression even thus conveyed of the moons real\r\ndistance from the earth it will nevertheless effect a good object in\r\nenabling us more clearly to see the futility of attempting to grasp such\r\nintervals as that of the  hundred millions of miles between our sun\r\nand neptune or even that of the  millions between the sun and the\r\nearth we inhabit a cannonball flying at the greatest velocity with\r\nwhich such a ball has ever been known to fly could not traverse the\r\nlatter interval in less than  years while for the former it would\r\nrequire \r\n\r\nour moons real diameter is  miles yet she is comparatively so\r\ntrifling an object that it would take nearly  such orbs to compose one\r\nas great as the earth\r\n\r\nthe diameter of our own globe is  milesbut from the enunciation of\r\nthese numbers what positive idea do we derive\r\n\r\nif we ascend an ordinary mountain and look around us from its summit we\r\nbehold a landscape stretching say  miles in every direction forming\r\na circle  miles in circumference and including an area of \r\nsquare miles the extent of such a prospect on account of the\r\nsuccessiveness with which its portions necessarily present themselves\r\nto view can be only very feebly and very partially appreciatedyet the\r\nentire panorama would comprehend no more than one th part of the\r\nmere surface of our globe were this panorama then to be succeeded\r\nafter the lapse of an hour by another of equal extent this again by a\r\nthird after the lapse of another hour this again by a fourth after\r\nlapse of another hourand so on until the scenery of the whole earth\r\nwere exhausted and were we to be engaged in examining these various\r\npanoramas for twelve hours of every day we should nevertheless be \r\nyears and  days in completing the general survey\r\n\r\nbut if the mere surface of the earth eludes the grasp of the\r\nimagination what are we to think of its cubical contents it embraces a\r\nmass of matter equal in weight to at least  sextillions \r\nquintillions of tons let us suppose it in a state of quiescence and\r\nnow let us endeavor to conceive a mechanical force sufficient to set it\r\nin motion not the strength of all the myriads of beings whom we may\r\nconclude to inhabit the planetary worlds of our systemnot the combined\r\nphysical strength of all these beingseven admitting all to be more\r\npowerful than manwould avail to stir the ponderous mass a single inch\r\nfrom its position\r\n\r\nwhat are we to understand then of the force which under similar\r\ncircumstances would be required to move the largest of our planets\r\njupiter this is  miles in diameter and would include within its\r\nperiphery more than a thousand orbs of the magnitude of our own yet\r\nthis stupendous body is actually flying around the sun at the rate of\r\n miles an hourthat is to say with a velocity  times greater\r\nthan that of a cannonball the thought of such a phænomenon cannot well\r\nbe said to startle the mindit palsies and appals it not\r\nunfrequently we task our imagination in picturing the capacities of an\r\nangel let us fancy such a being at a distance of some hundred miles\r\nfrom jupitera close eyewitness of this planet as it speeds on its\r\nannual revolution now can we i demand fashion for ourselves any\r\nconception so distinct of this ideal beings spiritual exaltation as\r\nthat involved in the supposition that even by this immeasurable mass\r\nof matter whirled immediately before his eyes with a velocity so\r\nunutterable hean angelangelic though he beis not at once struck into\r\nnothingness and overwhelmed\r\n\r\nat this point however it seems proper to suggest that in fact we\r\nhave been speaking of comparative trifles our sun the central and\r\ncontrolling orb of the system to which jupiter belongs is not only\r\ngreater than jupiter but greater by far than all the planets of the\r\nsystem taken together this fact is an essential condition indeed of\r\nthe stability of the system itself the diameter of jupiter has been\r\nmentionedit is  milesthat of the sun is  miles an\r\ninhabitant of the latter travelling  miles a day would be more than\r\n years in going round a great circle of its circumference it occupies\r\na cubical space of  quadrillions  trillions of miles the moon\r\nas has been stated revolves about the earth at a distance of \r\nmilesin an orbit consequently of nearly a million and a half now\r\nwere the sun placed upon the earth centre over centre the body of the\r\nformer would extend in every direction not only to the line of the\r\nmoons orbit but beyond it a distance of  miles\r\n\r\nand here once again let me suggest that in fact we have still been\r\nspeaking of comparative trifles the distance of the planet neptune from\r\nthe sun has been statedit is  hundred millions of miles the\r\ncircumference of its orbit therefore is about  billions let this be\r\nborne in mind while we glance at some one of the brightest stars\r\nbetween this and the star of our system the sun there is a gulf of\r\nspace to convey any idea of which we should need the tongue of an\r\narchangel from our system then and from our sun or star the\r\nstar at which we suppose ourselves glancing is a thing altogether\r\napartstill for the moment let us imagine it placed upon our sun\r\ncentre over centre as we just now imagined this sun itself placed upon\r\nthe earth let us now conceive the particular star we have in mind\r\nextending in every direction beyond the orbit of mercuryof venusof\r\nthe earthstill on beyond the orbit of marsof jupiterof\r\nuranusuntil finally we fancy it filling the circle billions of\r\nmiles in circumferencewhich is described by the revolution of\r\nleverriers planet when we have conceived all this we shall have\r\nentertained no extravagant conception there is the very best reason for\r\nbelieving that many of the stars are even far larger than the one we\r\nhave imagined i mean to say that we have the very best empirical\r\nbasis for such beliefand in looking back at the original atomic\r\narrangements for diversity which have been assumed as a part of the\r\ndivine plan in the constitution of the universe we shall be enabled\r\neasily to understand and to credit the existence of even far vaster\r\ndisproportions in stellar size than any to which i have hitherto\r\nalluded the largest orbs of course we must expect to find rolling\r\nthrough the widest vacancies of space\r\n\r\ni remarked just now that to convey an idea of the interval between our\r\nsun and any one of the other stars we should require the eloquence of\r\nan archangel in so saying i should not be accused of exaggeration\r\nfor in simple truth these are topics on which it is scarcely possible\r\nto exaggerate but let us bring the matter more distinctly before the\r\neye of the mind\r\n\r\nin the first place we may get a general relative conception of the\r\ninterval referred to by comparing it with the interplanetary spaces\r\nif for example we suppose the earth which is in reality  millions\r\nof miles from the sun to be only one foot from that luminary then\r\nneptune would be  feet distant and the star alpha lyræ at the very\r\nleast \r\n\r\nnow i presume that in the termination of my last sentence few of my\r\nreaders have noticed anything especially objectionableparticularly\r\nwrong i said that the distance of the earth from the sun being taken at\r\none foot the distance of neptune would be  feet and that of alpha\r\nlyræ  the proportion between one foot and  has appeared\r\nperhaps to convey a sufficiently definite impression of the proportion\r\nbetween the two intervalsthat of the earth from the sun and that of\r\nalpha lyræ from the same luminary but my account of the matter should\r\nin reality have run thusthe distance of the earth from the sun being\r\ntaken at one foot the distance of neptune would be  feet and that of\r\nalpha lyræ milesthat is to say i had assigned to alpha lyræ\r\nin my first statement of the case only the th part of that\r\ndistance which is the least distance possible at which it can actually\r\nlie\r\n\r\nto proceedhowever distant a mere planet is yet when we look at it\r\nthrough a telescope we see it under a certain formof a certain\r\nappreciable size now i have already hinted at the probable bulk of many\r\nof the stars nevertheless when we view any one of them even through\r\nthe most powerful telescope it is found to present us with no form\r\nand consequently with no magnitude whatever we see it as a point and\r\nnothing more\r\n\r\nagainlet us suppose ourselves walking at night on a highway in a\r\nfield on one side of the road is a line of tall objects say trees the\r\nfigures of which are distinctly defined against the background of the\r\nsky this line of objects extends at right angles to the road and from\r\nthe road to the horizon now as we proceed along the road we see these\r\nobjects changing their positions respectively in relation to a certain\r\nfixed point in that portion of the firmament which forms the background\r\nof the view let us suppose this fixed pointsufficiently fixed for our\r\npurposeto be the rising moon we become aware at once that while the\r\ntree nearest us so far alters its position in respect to the moon as to\r\nseem flying behind us the tree in the extreme distance has scarcely\r\nchanged at all its relative position with the satellite we then go on\r\nto perceive that the farther the objects are from us the less they\r\nalter their positions and the converse then we begin unwittingly to\r\nestimate the distances of individual trees by the degrees in which they\r\nevince the relative alteration finally we come to understand how it\r\nmight be possible to ascertain the actual distance of any given tree in\r\nthe line by using the amount of relative alteration as a basis in a\r\nsimple geometrical problem now this relative alteration is what we call\r\nparallax and by parallax we calculate the distances of the heavenly\r\nbodies applying the principle to the trees in question we should of\r\ncourse be very much at a loss to comprehend the distance of that\r\ntree which however far we proceeded along the road should evince no\r\nparallax at all this in the case described is a thing impossible but\r\nimpossible only because all distances on our earth are trivial\r\nindeedin comparison with the vast cosmical quantities we may speak of\r\nthem as absolutely nothing\r\n\r\nnow let us suppose the star alpha lyræ directly overhead and let us\r\nimagine that instead of standing on the earth we stand at one end of a\r\nstraight road stretching through space to a distance equalling the\r\ndiameter of the earths orbitthat is to say to a distance of \r\nmillions of miles having observed by means of the most delicate\r\nmicrometrical instruments the exact position of the star let us now\r\npass along this inconceivable road until we reach its other extremity\r\nnow once again let us look at the star it is precisely where we\r\nleft it our instruments however delicate assure us that its relative\r\nposition is absolutelyis identically the same as at the commencement of\r\nour unutterable journey no parallaxnone whateverhas been found\r\n\r\nthe fact is that in regard to the distance of the fixed starsof any\r\none of the myriads of suns glistening on the farther side of that awful\r\nchasm which separates our system from its brothers in the cluster to\r\nwhich it belongsastronomical science until very lately could speak\r\nonly with a negative certainty assuming the brightest as the nearest\r\nwe could say even of them only that there is a certain\r\nincomprehensible distance on the hither side of which they cannot\r\nbehow far they are beyond it we had in no case been able to ascertain\r\nwe perceived for example that alpha lyræ cannot be nearer to us than\r\n trillions  billions of miles but for all we knew and indeed\r\nfor all we now know it may be distant from us the square or the cube\r\nor any other power of the number mentioned by dint however of\r\nwonderfully minute and cautious observations continued with novel\r\ninstruments for many laborious years bessel not long ago deceased\r\nhas lately succeeded in determining the distance of six or seven stars\r\namong others that of the star numbered  in the constellation of the\r\nswan the distance in this latter instance ascertained is  times\r\nthat of the sun which last it will be remembered is  millions of\r\nmiles the star  cygni then is nearly  trillions of miles from\r\nusor more than three times the distance assigned as the least\r\npossible for alpha lyræ\r\n\r\nin attempting to appreciate this interval by the aid of any\r\nconsiderations of velocity as we did in endeavoring to estimate the\r\ndistance of the moon we must leave out of sight altogether such\r\nnothings as the speed of a cannonball or of sound light however\r\naccording to the latest calculations of struve proceeds at the rate of\r\n miles in a second thought itself cannot pass through this\r\ninterval more speedilyif indeed thought can traverse it at all yet\r\nin coming from  cygni to us even at this inconceivable rate light\r\noccupies more than ten years and consequently were the star this\r\nmoment blotted out from the universe still for ten years would it\r\ncontinue to sparkle on undimmed in its paradoxical glory\r\n\r\nkeeping now in mind whatever feeble conception we may have attained of\r\nthe interval between our sun and  cygni let us remember that this\r\ninterval however unutterably vast we are permitted to consider as but\r\nthe average interval among the countless host of stars composing that\r\ncluster or nebula to which our system as well as that of  cygni\r\nbelongs i have in fact stated the case with great moderationwe have\r\nexcellent reason for believing  cygni to be one of the nearest\r\nstars and thus for concluding at least for the present that its\r\ndistance from us is less than the average distance between star and\r\nstar in the magnificent cluster of the milky way\r\n\r\nand here once again and finally it seems proper to suggest that even\r\nas yet we have been speaking of trifles ceasing to wonder at the space\r\nbetween star and star in our own or in any particular cluster let us\r\nrather turn our thoughts to the intervals between cluster and cluster\r\nin the all comprehensive cluster of the universe\r\n\r\ni have already said that light proceeds at the rate of  miles in\r\na secondthat is about  millions of miles in a minute or about \r\nmillions of miles in an houryet so far removed from us are some of\r\nthe nebulæ that even light speeding with this velocity could not\r\nand does not reach us from those mysterious regions in less than \r\nmillions of years this calculation moreover is made by the elder\r\nherschell and in reference merely to those comparatively proximate\r\nclusters within the scope of his own telescope there are nebulæ\r\nhowever which through the magical tube of lord rosse are this instant\r\nwhispering in our ears the secrets of a million of ages bygone in a\r\nword the events which we behold nowat this momentin those worldsare\r\nthe identical events which interested their inhabitants ten hundred\r\nthousand centuries ago in intervalsin distances such as this\r\nsuggestion forces upon the soulrather than upon the mindwe find at\r\nlength a fitting climax to all hitherto frivolous considerations of\r\nquantity\r\n\r\nour fancies thus occupied with the cosmical distances let us take the\r\nopportunity of referring to the difficulty which we have so often\r\nexperienced while pursuing the beaten path of astronomical\r\nreflection in accounting for the immeasurable voids alluded toin\r\ncomprehending why chasms so totally unoccupied and therefore apparently\r\nso needless have been made to intervene between star and starbetween\r\ncluster and clusterin understanding to be brief a sufficient reason\r\nfor the titanic scale in respect of mere space on which the universe\r\nis seen to be constructed a rational cause for the phænomenon i\r\nmaintain that astronomy has palpably failed to assignbut the\r\nconsiderations through which in this essay we have proceeded step by\r\nstep enable us clearly and immediately to perceive that space and\r\nduration are one that the universe might endure throughout an æra\r\nat all commensurate with the grandeur of its component material portions\r\nand with the high majesty of its spiritual purposes it was necessary\r\nthat the original atomic diffusion be made to so inconceivable an extent\r\nas to be only not infinite it was required in a word that the stars\r\nshould be gathered into visibility from invisible nebulosityproceed\r\nfrom nebulosity to consolidationand so grow grey in giving birth and\r\ndeath to unspeakably numerous and complex variations of vitalic\r\ndevelopmentit was required that the stars should do all thisshould\r\nhave time thoroughly to accomplish all these divine purposesduring the\r\nperiod in which all things were effecting their return into unity with\r\na velocity accumulating in the inverse proportion of the squares of the\r\ndistances at which lay the inevitable end\r\n\r\nthroughout all this we have no difficulty in understanding the absolute\r\naccuracy of the divine adaptation the density of the stars\r\nrespectively proceeds of course as their condensation diminishes\r\ncondensation and heterogeneity keep pace with each other through the\r\nlatter which is the index of the former we estimate the vitalic and\r\nspiritual development thus in the density of the globes we have the\r\nmeasure in which their purposes are fulfilled as density\r\nproceedsas the divine intentions are accomplishedas less and\r\nstill less remains to be accomplishedsoin the same ratioshould we\r\nexpect to find an acceleration of the endand thus the philosophical\r\nmind will easily comprehend that the divine designs in constituting the\r\nstars advance mathematically to their fulfilmentand more it will\r\nreadily give the advance a mathematical expression it will decide that\r\nthis advance is inversely proportional with the squares of the distances\r\nof all created things from the startingpoint and goal of their\r\ncreation\r\n\r\nnot only is this divine adaptation however mathematically accurate\r\nbut there is that about it which stamps it as divine in distinction\r\nfrom that which is merely the work of human constructiveness i allude\r\nto the complete mutuality of adaptation for example in human\r\nconstructions a particular cause has a particular effect a particular\r\nintention brings to pass a particular object but this is all we see no\r\nreciprocity the effect does not react upon the cause the intention\r\ndoes not change relations with the object in divine constructions the\r\nobject is either design or object as we choose to regard itand we may\r\ntake at any time a cause for an effect or the converseso that we can\r\nnever absolutely decide which is which\r\n\r\nto give an instancein polar climates the human frame to maintain its\r\nanimal heat requires for combustion in the capillary system an\r\nabundant supply of highly azotized food such as trainoil but\r\nagainin polar climates nearly the sole food afforded man is the oil of\r\nabundant seals and whales now whether is oil at hand because\r\nimperatively demanded or the only thing demanded because the only thing\r\nto be obtained it is impossible to decide there is an absolute\r\nreciprocity of adaptation\r\n\r\nthe pleasure which we derive from any display of human ingenuity is in\r\nthe ratio of the approach to this species of reciprocity in the\r\nconstruction of plot for example in fictitious literature we\r\nshould aim at so arranging the incidents that we shall not be able to\r\ndetermine of any one of them whether it depends from any one other or\r\nupholds it in this sense of course perfection of plot is really\r\nor practically unattainablebut only because it is a finite\r\nintelligence that constructs the plots of god are perfect the universe\r\nis a plot of god\r\n\r\nand now we have reached a point at which the intellect is forced again\r\nto struggle against its propensity for analogical inferenceagainst its\r\nmonomaniac grasping at the infinite moons have been seen revolving\r\nabout planets planets about stars and the poetical instinct of\r\nhumanityits instinct of the symmetrical if the symmetry be but a\r\nsymmetry of surfacethis instinct which the soul not only of man\r\nbut of all created beings took up in the beginning from the\r\ngeometrical basis of the universal irradiationimpels us to the fancy\r\nof an endless extension of this system of cycles closing our eyes\r\nequally to deduction and induction we insist upon imagining a\r\nrevolution of all the orbs of the galaxy about some gigantic globe\r\nwhich we take to be the central pivot of the whole each cluster in the\r\ngreat cluster of clusters is imagined of course to be similarly\r\nsupplied and constructed while that the analogy may be wanting at no\r\npoint we go on to conceive these clusters themselves again as\r\nrevolving about some still more august spherethis latter still\r\nagain with its encircling clusters as but one of a yet more\r\nmagnificent series of agglomerations gyrating about yet another orb\r\ncentral to themsome orb still more unspeakably sublimesome orb let\r\nus rather say of infinite sublimity endlessly multiplied by the\r\ninfinitely sublime such are the conditions continued in perpetuity\r\nwhich the voice of what some people term analogy calls upon the fancy\r\nto depict and the reason to contemplate if possible without becoming\r\ndissatisfied with the picture such in general are the interminable\r\ngyrations beyond gyration which we have been instructed by philosophy to\r\ncomprehend and to account for at least in the best manner we can now\r\nand then however a philosopher properone whose phrenzy takes a very\r\ndeterminate turnwhose genius to speak more reverentially has a\r\nstronglypronounced washerwomanish bias doing every thing up by the\r\ndozenenables us to see precisely that point out of sight at which\r\nthe revolutionary processes in question do and of right ought to come\r\nto an end\r\n\r\nit is hardly worth while perhaps even to sneer at the reveries of\r\nfourrierbut much has been said latterly of the hypothesis of\r\nmädlerthat there exists in the centre of the galaxy a stupendous\r\nglobe about which all the systems of the cluster revolve the period\r\nof our own indeed has been stated millions of years\r\n\r\nthat our sun has a motion in space independently of its rotation and\r\nrevolution about the systems centre of gravity has long been\r\nsuspected this motion granting it to exist would be manifested\r\nperspectively the stars in that firmamental region which we were\r\nleaving behind us would in a very long series of years become\r\ncrowded those in the opposite quarter scattered now by means of\r\nastronomical history we ascertain cloudily that some such phænomena\r\nhave occurred on this ground it has been declared that our system is\r\nmoving to a point in the heavens diametrically opposite the star zeta\r\nherculisbut this inference is perhaps the maximum to which we have\r\nany logical right mädler however has gone so far as to designate a\r\nparticular star alcyone in the pleiades as being at or about the very\r\nspot around which a general revolution is performed\r\n\r\nnow since by analogy we are led in the first instance to these\r\ndreams it is no more than proper that we should abide by analogy at\r\nleast in some measure during their development and that analogy which\r\nsuggests the revolution suggests at the same time a central orb about\r\nwhich it should be performedso far the astronomer was consistent this\r\ncentral orb however should dynamically be greater than all the orbs\r\ntaken together which surround it of these there are about \r\nmillions why then it was of course demanded do we not see this\r\nvast central sunat least equal in mass to  millions of such suns\r\nas ourswhy do we not see itwe especially who occupy the mid\r\nregion of the clusterthe very locality near which at all events\r\nmust be situated this incomparable star the reply was readyit must\r\nbe nonluminous as are our planets here then to suit a purpose\r\nanalogy is suddenly let fall not so it may be saidwe know that\r\nnonluminous suns actually exist it is true that we have reason at\r\nleast for supposing so but we have certainly no reason whatever for\r\nsupposing that the nonluminous suns in question are encircled by\r\nluminous suns while these again are surrounded by nonluminous\r\nplanetsand it is precisely all this with which mädler is called upon\r\nto find any thing analogous in the heavensfor it is precisely all this\r\nwhich he imagines in the case of the galaxy admitting the thing to be\r\nso we cannot help here picturing to ourselves how sad a puzzle the why\r\nit is so must prove to all à priori philosophers\r\n\r\nbut granting in the very teeth of analogy and of every thing else the\r\nnonluminosity of the vast central orb we may still inquire how this\r\norb so enormous could fail of being rendered visible by the flood of\r\nlight thrown upon it from the  millions of glorious suns glaring in\r\nall directions about it upon the urging of this question the idea of\r\nan actually solid central sun appears in some measure to have been\r\nabandoned and speculation proceeded to assert that the systems of the\r\ncluster perform their revolutions merely about an immaterial centre of\r\ngravity common to all here again then to suit a purpose analogy is\r\nlet fall the planets of our system revolve it is true about a common\r\ncentre of gravity but they do this in connexion with and in\r\nconsequence of a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the\r\nrest of the system\r\n\r\nthe mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight\r\nlines but this idea of the circlean idea which in view of all\r\nordinary geometry is merely the mathematical as contradistinguished\r\nfrom the practical ideais in sober fact the practical conception\r\nwhich alone we have any right to entertain in regard to the majestic\r\ncircle with which we have to deal at least in fancy when we suppose\r\nour system revolving about a point in the centre of the galaxy let the\r\nmost vigorous of human imaginations attempt but to take a single step\r\ntowards the comprehension of a sweep so ineffable it would scarcely be\r\nparadoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself travelling\r\nforever upon the circumference of this unutterable circle would\r\nstill forever be travelling in a straight line that the path of our\r\nsun in such an orbit would to any human perception deviate in the\r\nslightest degree from a straight line even in a million of years is a\r\nproposition not to be entertainedyet we are required to believe that a\r\ncurvature has become apparent during the brief period of our\r\nastronomical historyduring a mere pointduring the utter nothingness of\r\ntwo or three thousand years\r\n\r\nit may be said that mädler has really ascertained a curvature in the\r\ndirection of our systems now wellestablished progress through space\r\nadmitting if necessary this fact to be in reality such i maintain\r\nthat nothing is thereby shown except the reality of this factthe fact\r\nof a curvature for its thorough determination ages will be required\r\nand when determined it will be found indicative of some binary or\r\nother multiple relation between our sun and some one or more of the\r\nproximate stars i hazard nothing however in predicting that after\r\nthe lapse of many centuries all efforts at determining the path of our\r\nsun through space will be abandoned as fruitless this is easily\r\nconceivable when we look at the infinity of perturbation it must\r\nexperience from its perpetuallyshifting relations with other orbs in\r\nthe common approach of all to the nucleus of the galaxy\r\n\r\nbut in examining other nebulæ than that of the milky wayin surveying\r\ngenerally the clusters which overspread the heavensdo we or do we not\r\nfind confirmation of mädlers hypothesis we do not the forms of the\r\nclusters are exceedingly diverse when casually viewed but on close\r\ninspection through powerful telescopes we recognize the sphere very\r\ndistinctly as at least the proximate form of alltheir constitution\r\nin general being at variance with the idea of revolution about a common\r\ncentre\r\n\r\nit is difficult says sir john herschell to form any conception of\r\nthe dynamical state of such systems on one hand without a rotary\r\nmotion and a centrifugal force it is hardly possible not to regard them\r\nas in a state of progressive collapse on the other granting such a\r\nmotion and such a force we find it no less difficult to reconcile their\r\nforms with the rotation of the whole system meaning cluster around any\r\nsingle axis without which internal collision would appear to be\r\ninevitable\r\n\r\nsome remarks lately made about the nebulæ by dr nichol in taking\r\nquite a different view of the cosmical conditions from any taken in this\r\ndiscoursehave a very peculiar applicability to the point now at issue\r\nhe says\r\n\r\nwhen our greatest telescopes are brought to bear upon them we find\r\nthat those which were thought to be irregular are not so they approach\r\nnearer to a globe here is one that looked oval but lord rosses\r\ntelescope brought it into a circle now there occurs a very\r\nremarkable circumstance in reference to these comparatively sweeping\r\ncircular masses of nebulæ we find they are not entirely circular but\r\nthe reverse and that all around them on every side there are volumes\r\nof stars stretching out apparently as if they were rushing towards a\r\ngreat central mass in consequence of the action of some great\r\npower\r\n\r\n     i must be understood as denying especially only the\r\n    revolutionary portion of mädlers hypothesis of course if\r\n    no great central orb exists now in our cluster such will\r\n    exist hereafter whenever existing it will be merely the\r\n    nucleus of the consolidation\r\n\r\nwere i to describe in my own words what must necessarily be the\r\nexisting condition of each nebula on the hypothesis that all matter is\r\nas i suggest now returning to its original unity i should simply be\r\ngoing over nearly verbatim the language here employed by dr nichol\r\nwithout the faintest suspicion of that stupendous truth which is the key\r\nto these nebular phænomena\r\n\r\nand here let me fortify my position still farther by the voice of a\r\ngreater than mädlerof one moreover to whom all the data of mädler\r\nhave long been familiar things carefully and thoroughly considered\r\nreferring to the elaborate calculations of argelanderthe very\r\nresearches which form mädlers basishumboldt whose generalizing\r\npowers have never perhaps been equalled has the following observation\r\n\r\nwhen we regard the real proper or nonperspective motions of the\r\nstars we find many groups of them moving in opposite directions and\r\nthe data as yet in hand render it not necessary at least to conceive\r\nthat the systems composing the milky way or the clusters generally\r\ncomposing the universe are revolving about any particular centre\r\nunknown whether luminous or nonluminous it is but mans longing for a\r\nfundamental first cause that impels both his intellect and his fancy\r\nto the adoption of such an hypothesis\r\n\r\n     betrachtet man die nicht perspectivischen eigenen\r\n    bewegungen der sterne so scheinen viele gruppenweise in ihrer\r\n    richtung entgegengesetzt und die bisher gesammelten thatsachen\r\n    machen es aufs wenigste nicht nothwendig anzunehmen dass\r\n    alle theile unserer sternenschicht oder gar der gesammten\r\n    sterneninseln welche den weltraum füllen sich um einen\r\n    grossen unbekannten leuchtenden oder dunkeln centralkörper\r\n    bewegen das streben nach den letzten und höchsten\r\n    grundursachen macht freilich die reflectirende thätigkeit des\r\n    menschen wie seine phantasie zu einer solchen annahme\r\n    geneigt\r\n\r\nthe phænomenon here alluded tothat of many groups moving in opposite\r\ndirectionsis quite inexplicable by mädlers idea but arises as a\r\nnecessary consequence from that which forms the basis of this\r\ndiscourse while the merely general direction of each atomof each\r\nmoon planet star or clusterwould on my hypothesis be of course\r\nabsolutely rectilinear while the general path of all bodies would be\r\na right line leading to the centre of all it is clear nevertheless\r\nthat this general rectilinearity would be compounded of what with\r\nscarcely any exaggeration we may term an infinity of particular\r\ncurvesan infinity of local deviations from rectilinearitythe result of\r\ncontinuous differences of relative position among the multitudinous\r\nmasses as each proceeded on its own proper journey to the end\r\n\r\ni quoted just now from sir john herschell the following words used\r\nin reference to the clusterson one hand without a rotary motion and\r\na centrifugal force it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a\r\nstate of progressive collapse the fact is that in surveying the\r\nnebulæ with a telescope of high power we shall find it quite\r\nimpossible having once conceived this idea of collapse not to\r\ngather at all points corroboration of the idea a nucleus is always\r\napparent in the direction of which the stars seem to be precipitating\r\nthemselves nor can these nuclei be mistaken for merely perspective\r\nphænomenathe clusters are really denser near the centresparser in\r\nthe regions more remote from it in a word we see every thing as we\r\nshould see it were a collapse taking place but in general it may be\r\nsaid of these clusters that we can fairly entertain while looking at\r\nthem the idea of orbitual movement about a centre only by admitting\r\nthe possible existence in the distant domains of space of dynamical\r\nlaws with which we are unacquainted\r\n\r\non the part of herschell however there is evidently a reluctance to\r\nregard the nebulæ as in a state of progressive collapse but if\r\nfactsif even appearances justify the supposition of their being in this\r\nstate why it may well be demanded is he disinclined to admit it\r\nsimply on account of a prejudicemerely because the supposition is at\r\nwar with a preconceived and utterly baseless notionthat of the\r\nendlessnessthat of the eternal stability of the universe\r\n\r\nif the propositions of this discourse are tenable the state of\r\nprogressive collapse is precisely that state in which alone we are\r\nwarranted in considering all things and with due humility let me here\r\nconfess that for my part i am at a loss to conceive how any other\r\nunderstanding of the existing condition of affairs could ever have made\r\nits way into the human brain the tendency to collapse and the\r\nattraction of gravitation are convertible phrases in using either we\r\nspeak of the rëaction of the first act never was necessity less obvious\r\nthan that of supposing matter imbued with an ineradicable quality\r\nforming part of its material naturea quality or instinct forever\r\ninseparable from it and by dint of which inalienable principle every\r\natom is perpetually impelled to seek its fellowatom never was\r\nnecessity less obvious than that of entertaining this unphilosophical\r\nidea going boldly behind the vulgar thought we have to conceive\r\nmetaphysically that the gravitating principle appertains to matter\r\ntemporarilyonly while diffusedonly while existing as many instead of\r\nas oneappertains to it by virtue of its state of irradiation\r\naloneappertains in a word altogether to its condition and not in\r\nthe slightest degree to itself in this view when the irradiation\r\nshall have returned into its sourcewhen the rëaction shall be\r\ncompletedthe gravitating principle will no longer exist and in fact\r\nastronomers without at any time reaching the idea here suggested seem\r\nto have been approximating it in the assertion that if there were but\r\none body in the universe it would be impossible to understand how the\r\nprinciple gravity could obtainthat is to say from a consideration\r\nof matter as they find it they reach a conclusion at which i\r\ndeductively arrive that so pregnant a suggestion as the one just quoted\r\nshould have been permitted to remain so long unfruitful is\r\nnevertheless a mystery which i find it difficult to fathom\r\n\r\nit is perhaps in no little degree however our propensity for the\r\ncontinuousfor the analogicalin the present case more particularly for\r\nthe symmetricalwhich has been leading us astray and in fact the\r\nsense of the symmetrical is an instinct which may be depended upon with\r\nan almost blindfold reliance it is the poetical essence of the\r\nuniverseof the universe which in the supremeness of its symmetry is\r\nbut the most sublime of poems now symmetry and consistency are\r\nconvertible termsthus poetry and truth are one a thing is consistent\r\nin the ratio of its truthtrue in the ratio of its consistency a\r\nperfect consistency i repeat can be nothing but an absolute truth we\r\nmay take it for granted then that man cannot long or widely err if he\r\nsuffer himself to be guided by his poetical which i have maintained to\r\nbe his truthful in being his symmetrical instinct he must have a\r\ncare however lest in pursuing too heedlessly the superficial symmetry\r\nof forms and motions he leave out of sight the really essential\r\nsymmetry of the principles which determine and control them\r\n\r\nthat the stellar bodies would finally be merged in onethat at last\r\nall would be drawn into the substance of one stupendous central orb\r\nalready existingis an idea which for some time past seems vaguely\r\nand indeterminately to have held possession of the fancy of mankind it\r\nis an idea in fact which belongs to the class of the excessively\r\nobvious it springs instantly from a superficial observation of the\r\ncyclic and seemingly gyrating or vorticial movements of those\r\nindividual portions of the universe which come most immediately and most\r\nclosely under our observation there is not perhaps a human being of\r\nordinary education and of average reflective capacity to whom at some\r\nperiod the fancy in question has not occurred as if spontaneously or\r\nintuitively and wearing all the character of a very profound and very\r\noriginal conception this conception however so commonly entertained\r\nhas never within my knowledge arisen out of any abstract\r\nconsiderations being on the contrary always suggested as i say by\r\nthe vorticial movements about centres a reason for it alsoa cause\r\nfor the ingathering of all the orbs into one imagined to be already\r\nexisting was naturally sought in the same directionamong these cyclic\r\nmovements themselves\r\n\r\nthus it happened that on announcement of the gradual and perfectly\r\nregular decrease observed in the orbit of encks comet at every\r\nsuccessive revolution about our sun astronomers were nearly unanimous\r\nin the opinion that the cause in question was foundthat a principle was\r\ndiscovered sufficient to account physically for that final universal\r\nagglomeration which i repeat the analogical symmetrical or poetical\r\ninstinct of man had predetermined to understand as something more than a\r\nsimple hypothesis\r\n\r\nthis causethis sufficient reason for the final ingatheringwas declared\r\nto exist in an exceedingly rare but still material medium pervading\r\nspace which medium by retarding in some degree the progress of the\r\ncomet perpetually weakened its tangential force thus giving a\r\npredominance to the centripetal which of course drew the comet nearer\r\nand nearer at each revolution and would eventually precipitate it upon\r\nthe sun\r\n\r\nall this was strictly logicaladmitting the medium or ether but this\r\nether was assumed most illogically on the ground that no other mode\r\nthan the one spoken of could be discovered of accounting for the\r\nobserved decrease in the orbit of the cometas if from the fact that we\r\ncould discover no other mode of accounting for it it followed in any\r\nrespect that no other mode of accounting for it existed it is clear\r\nthat innumerable causes might operate in combination to diminish the\r\norbit without even a possibility of our ever becoming acquainted with\r\none of them in the meantime it has never been fairly shown perhaps\r\nwhy the retardation occasioned by the skirts of the suns atmosphere\r\nthrough which the comet passes at perihelion is not enough to account\r\nfor the phænomenon that encks comet will be absorbed into the sun is\r\nprobable that all the comets of the system will be absorbed is more\r\nthan merely possible but in such case the principle of absorption\r\nmust be referred to eccentricity of orbitto the close approximation to\r\nthe sun of the comets at their perihelia and is a principle not\r\naffecting in any degree the ponderous spheres which are to be\r\nregarded as the true material constituents of the universetouching\r\ncomets in general let me here suggest in passing that we cannot be\r\nfar wrong in looking upon them as the lightningflashes of the cosmical\r\nheaven\r\n\r\nthe idea of a retarding ether and through it of a final agglomeration\r\nof all things seemed at one time however to be confirmed by the\r\nobservation of a positive decrease in the orbit of the solid moon by\r\nreference to eclipses recorded  years ago it was found that the\r\nvelocity of the satellites revolution then was considerably less than\r\nit is now that on the hypothesis that its motions in its orbit is\r\nuniformly in accordance with keplers law and was accurately determined\r\nthen years agoit is now in advance of the position it should\r\noccupy by nearly  miles the increase of velocity proved of\r\ncourse a diminution of orbit and astronomers were fast yielding to a\r\nbelief in an ether as the sole mode of accounting for the phænomenon\r\nwhen lagrange came to the rescue he showed that owing to the\r\nconfigurations of the spheroids the shorter axes of their ellipses are\r\nsubject to variation in length the longer axes being permanent and\r\nthat this variation is continuous and vibratoryso that every orbit is\r\nin a state of transition either from circle to ellipse or from ellipse\r\nto circle in the case of the moon where the shorter axis is\r\ndecreasing the orbit is passing from circle to ellipse and\r\nconsequently is decreasing too but after a long series of ages the\r\nultimate eccentricity will be attained then the shorter axis will\r\nproceed to increase until the orbit becomes a circle when the\r\nprocess of shortening will again take placeand so on forever in the\r\ncase of the earth the orbit is passing from ellipse to circle the\r\nfacts thus demonstrated do away of course with all necessity for\r\nsupposing an ether and with all apprehension of the systems\r\ninstabilityon the ethers account\r\n\r\nit will be remembered that i have myself assumed what we may term an\r\nether i have spoken of a subtle influence which we know to be ever\r\nin attendance upon matter although becoming manifest only through\r\nmatters heterogeneity to this influencewithout daring to touch it\r\nat all in any effort at explaining its awful naturei have referred\r\nthe various phænomena of electricity heat light magnetism and\r\nmoreof vitality consciousness and thoughtin a word of spirituality\r\nit will be seen at once then that the ether thus conceived is\r\nradically distinct from the ether of the astronomers inasmuch as theirs\r\nis matter and mine not\r\n\r\nwith the idea of a material ether seems thus to have departed\r\naltogether the thought of that universal agglomeration so long\r\npredetermined by the poetical fancy of mankindan agglomeration in\r\nwhich a sound philosophy might have been warranted in putting faith at\r\nleast to a certain extent if for no other reason than that by this\r\npoetical fancy it had been so predetermined but so far as\r\nastronomyso far as mere physics have yet spoken the cycles of the\r\nuniverse are perpetualthe universe has no conceivable end had an end\r\nbeen demonstrated however from so purely collateral a cause as an\r\nether mans instinct of the divine capacity to adapt would have\r\nrebelled against the demonstration we should have been forced to regard\r\nthe universe with some such sense of dissatisfaction as we experience in\r\ncontemplating an unnecessarily complex work of human art creation would\r\nhave affected us as an imperfect plot in a romance where the\r\ndénoûment is awkwardly brought about by interposed incidents external\r\nand foreign to the main subject instead of springing out of the bosom\r\nof the thesisout of the heart of the ruling ideainstead of arising as\r\na result of the primary propositionas inseparable and inevitable part\r\nand parcel of the fundamental conception of the book\r\n\r\nwhat i mean by the symmetry of mere surface will now be more clearly\r\nunderstood it is simply by the blandishment of this symmetry that we\r\nhave been beguiled into the general idea of which mädlers hypothesis is\r\nbut a partthe idea of the vorticial indrawing of the orbs dismissing\r\nthis nakedly physical conception the symmetry of principle sees the end\r\nof all things metaphysically involved in the thought of a beginning\r\nseeks and finds in this origin of all things the rudiment of this end\r\nand perceives the impiety of supposing this end likely to be brought\r\nabout less simplyless directlyless obviouslyless artisticallythan\r\nthrough the rëaction of the originating act\r\n\r\nrecurring then to a previous suggestion let us understand the\r\nsystemslet us understand each star with its attendant planetsas but a\r\ntitanic atom existing in space with precisely the same inclination for\r\nunity which characterized in the beginning the actual atoms after\r\ntheir irradiation throughout the universal sphere as these original\r\natoms rushed towards each other in generally straight lines so let us\r\nconceive as at least generally rectilinear the paths of the\r\nsystematoms towards their respective centres of aggregationand in\r\nthis direct drawing together of the systems into clusters with a\r\nsimilar and simultaneous drawing together of the clusters themselves\r\nwhile undergoing consolidation we have at length attained the great\r\nnowthe awful presentthe existing condition of the universe\r\n\r\nof the still more awful future a not irrational analogy may guide us in\r\nframing an hypothesis the equilibrium between the centripetal and\r\ncentrifugal forces of each system being necessarily destroyed upon\r\nattainment of a certain proximity to the nucleus of the cluster to which\r\nit belongs there must occur at once a chaotic or seemingly chaotic\r\nprecipitation of the moons upon the planets of the planets upon the\r\nsuns and of the suns upon the nuclei and the general result of this\r\nprecipitation must be the gathering of the myriad nowexisting stars of\r\nthe firmament into an almost infinitely less number of almost infinitely\r\nsuperior spheres in being immeasurably fewer the worlds of that day\r\nwill be immeasurably greater than our own then indeed amid\r\nunfathomable abysses will be glaring unimaginable suns but all this\r\nwill be merely a climacic magnificence foreboding the great end of this\r\nend the new genesis described can be but a very partial postponement\r\nwhile undergoing consolidation the clusters themselves with a speed\r\nprodigiously accumulative have been rushing towards their own general\r\ncentreand now with a thousandfold electric velocity commensurate\r\nonly with their material grandeur and with the spiritual passion of\r\ntheir appetite for oneness the majestic remnants of the tribe of stars\r\nflash at length into a common embrace the inevitable catastrophe is\r\nat hand\r\n\r\nbut this catastrophewhat is it we have seen accomplished the\r\ningathering of the orbs henceforward are we not to understand one\r\nmaterial globe of globes as constituting and comprehending the\r\nuniverse such a fancy would be altogether at war with every assumption\r\nand consideration of this discourse\r\n\r\ni have already alluded to that absolute reciprocity of adaptation\r\nwhich is the idiosyncrasy of the divine artstamping it divine up to\r\nthis point of our reflections we have been regarding the electrical\r\ninfluence as a something by dint of whose repulsion alone matter is\r\nenabled to exist in that state of diffusion demanded for the fulfilment\r\nof its purposesso far in a word we have been considering the\r\ninfluence in question as ordained for matters saketo subserve the\r\nobjects of matter with a perfectly legitimate reciprocity we are now\r\npermitted to look at matter as created solely for the sake of this\r\ninfluencesolely to serve the objects of this spiritual ether through\r\nthe aidby the meansthrough the agency of matter and by dint of its\r\nheterogeneityis this ether manifestedis spirit individualized it is\r\nmerely in the development of this ether through heterogeneity that\r\nparticular masses of matter become animatesensitiveand in the ratio of\r\ntheir heterogeneitysome reaching a degree of sensitiveness involving\r\nwhat we call thought and thus attaining conscious intelligence\r\n\r\nin this view we are enabled to perceive matter as a meansnot as an\r\nend its purposes are thus seen to have been comprehended in its\r\ndiffusion and with the return into unity these purposes cease the\r\nabsolutely consolidated globe of globes would be objectlesstherefore\r\nnot for a moment could it continue to exist matter created for an end\r\nwould unquestionably on fulfilment of that end be matter no longer\r\nlet us endeavor to understand that it would disappear and that god\r\nwould remain all in all\r\n\r\nthat every work of divine conception must cöexist and cöexpire with its\r\nparticular design seems to me especially obvious and i make no doubt\r\nthat on perceiving the final globe of globes to be objectless the\r\nmajority of my readers will be satisfied with my therefore it cannot\r\ncontinue to exist nevertheless as the startling thought of its\r\ninstantaneous disappearance is one which the most powerful intellect\r\ncannot be expected readily to entertain on grounds so decidedly\r\nabstract let us endeavor to look at the idea from some other and more\r\nordinary point of viewlet us see how thoroughly and beautifully it is\r\ncorroborated in an à posteriori consideration of matter as we actually\r\nfind it\r\n\r\ni have before said that attraction and repulsion being undeniably the\r\nsole properties by which matter is manifested to mind we are justified\r\nin assuming that matter exists only as attraction and repulsionin\r\nother words that attraction and repulsion are matter there being no\r\nconceivable case in which we may not employ the term matter and the\r\nterms attraction and repulsion taken together as equivalent and\r\ntherefore convertible expressions in logic\r\n\r\n     page \r\n\r\nnow the very definition of attraction implies particularitythe\r\nexistence of parts particles or atoms for we define it as the\r\ntendency of each atom c to every other atom c according to a\r\ncertain law of course where there are no partswhere there is\r\nabsolute unitywhere the tendency to oneness is satisfiedthere can be\r\nno attractionthis has been fully shown and all philosophy admits it\r\nwhen on fulfilment of its purposes then matter shall have returned\r\ninto its original condition of onea condition which presupposes the\r\nexpulsion of the separative ether whose province and whose capacity are\r\nlimited to keeping the atoms apart until that great day when this ether\r\nbeing no longer needed the overwhelming pressure of the finally\r\ncollective attraction shall at length just sufficiently predominate\r\nand expel itwhen i say matter finally expelling the ether shall\r\nhave returned into absolute unityit will then to speak paradoxically\r\nfor the moment be matter without attraction and without repulsionin\r\nother words matter without matterin other words again matter no\r\nmore in sinking into unity it will sink at once into that nothingness\r\nwhich to all finite perception unity must beinto that material\r\nnihility from which alone we can conceive it to have been evokedto have\r\nbeen created by the volition of god\r\n\r\n     gravity therefore must be the strongest of forcessee\r\n    page \r\n\r\ni repeat thenlet us endeavor to comprehend that the final globe of\r\nglobes will instantaneously disappear and that god will remain all in\r\nall\r\n\r\nbut are we here to pause not so on the universal agglomeration and\r\ndissolution we can readily conceive that a new and perhaps totally\r\ndifferent series of conditions may ensueanother creation and\r\nirradiation returning into itselfanother action and rëaction of the\r\ndivine will guiding our imaginations by that omniprevalent law of laws\r\nthe law of periodicity are we not indeed more than justified in\r\nentertaining a belieflet us say rather in indulging a hopethat the\r\nprocesses we have here ventured to contemplate will be renewed forever\r\nand forever and forever a novel universe swelling into existence and\r\nthen subsiding into nothingness at every throb of the heart divine\r\n\r\nand nowthis heart divinewhat is it it is our own\r\n\r\nlet not the merely seeming irreverence of this idea frighten our souls\r\nfrom that cool exercise of consciousnessfrom that deep tranquillity of\r\nselfinspectionthrough which alone we can hope to attain the presence\r\nof this the most sublime of truths and look it leisurely in the face\r\n\r\nthe phænomena on which our conclusions must at this point depend are\r\nmerely spiritual shadows but not the less thoroughly substantial\r\n\r\nwe walk about amid the destinies of our worldexistence encompassed by\r\ndim but ever present memories of a destiny more vastvery distant in\r\nthe bygone time and infinitely awful\r\n\r\nwe live out a youth peculiarly haunted by such dreams yet never\r\nmistaking them for dreams as memories we know them during our\r\nyouth the distinction is too clear to deceive us even for a moment\r\n\r\nso long as this youth endures the feeling that we exist is the most\r\nnatural of all feelings we understand it thoroughly that there was a\r\nperiod at which we did not existor that it might so have happened\r\nthat we never had existed at allare the considerations indeed which\r\nduring this youth we find difficulty in understanding why we should\r\nnot exist is up to the epoch of our manhood of

another the intense overwhelming dissatisfaction and rebellion at\r\nthe thoughtthese with the omniprevalent aspirations at perfection\r\nare but the spiritual coincident with the material struggles towards\r\nthe original unityare to my mind at least a species of proof far\r\nsurpassing what man terms demonstration that no one soul is inferior\r\nto anotherthat nothing is or can be superior to any one soulthat\r\neach soul is in part its own godits own creatorin a word that\r\ngodthe material and spiritual godnow exists solely in the diffused\r\nmatter and spirit of the universe and that the regathering of this\r\ndiffused matter and spirit will be but the reconstitution of the\r\npurely spiritual and individual god\r\n\r\nin this view and in this view alone we comprehend the riddles of\r\ndivine injusticeof inexorable fate in this view alone the existence of\r\nevil becomes intelligible but in this view it becomes moreit becomes\r\nendurable our souls no longer rebel at a sorrow which we ourselves\r\nhave imposed upon ourselves in furtherance of our own purposeswith a\r\nviewif even with a futile viewto the extension of our own joy\r\n\r\ni have spoken of memories that haunt
