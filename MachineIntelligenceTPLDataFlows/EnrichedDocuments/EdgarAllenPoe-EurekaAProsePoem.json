WITH VERY PROFOUND RESPECT,                          This Work is Dedicated                                    TO                          ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT.     PREFACE.   To the few who love me and whom I love—to those who feel rather than to those who think—to the dreamers and those who put faith in dreams as in the only realities—I offer this Book of Truths, not in its character of Truth-Teller, but for the Beauty that abounds in its Truth; constituting it true. To these I present the composition as an Art-Product alone:—let us say as a Romance; or, if I be not urging too lofty a claim, as a Poem.  _What I here propound is true_:—therefore it cannot die:—or if by any means it be now trodden down so that it die, it will “rise again to the Life Everlasting.”  Nevertheless it is as a Poem only that I wish this work to be judged after I am dead.  E. A. P.     EUREKA:  AN ESSAY ON THE MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL UNIVERSE.   It is with humility really unassumed—it is with a sentiment even of awe—that I pen the opening sentence of this work: for of all conceivable subjects I approach the reader with the most solemn—the most comprehensive—the most difficult—the most august.  What terms shall I find sufficiently simple in their sublimity—sufficiently sublime in their simplicity—for the mere enunciation of my theme?  I design to speak of the _Physical, Metaphysical and Mathematical—of the Material and Spiritual Universe:—of its Essence, its Origin, its Creation, its Present Condition and its Destiny_. I shall be so rash, moreover, as to challenge the conclusions, and thus, in effect, to question the sagacity, of many of the greatest and most justly reverenced of men.  In the beginning, let me as distinctly as possible announce—not the theorem which I hope to demonstrate—for, whatever the mathematicians may assert, there is, in this world at least, _no such thing_ as demonstration—but the ruling idea which, throughout this volume, I shall be continually endeavoring to suggest.  My general proposition, then, is this:—_In the Original Unity of the First Thing lies the Secondary Cause of All Things, with the Germ of their Inevitable Annihilation_.  In illustration of this idea, I propose to take such a survey of the Universe that the mind may be able really to receive and to perceive an individual impression.  He who from the top of Ætna casts his eyes leisurely around, is affected chiefly by the _extent_ and _diversity_ of the scene. Only by a rapid whirling on his heel could he hope to comprehend the panorama in the sublimity of its _oneness_. But as, on the summit of Ætna, _no_ man has thought of whirling on his heel, so no man has ever taken into his brain the full uniqueness of the prospect; and so, again, whatever considerations lie involved in this uniqueness, have as yet no practical existence for mankind.  I do not know a treatise in which a survey of the _Universe_—using the word in its most comprehensive and only legitimate acceptation—is taken at all:—and it may be as well here to mention that by the term “Universe,” wherever employed without qualification in this essay, I mean to designate _the utmost conceivable expanse of space, with all things, spiritual and material, that can be imagined to exist within the compass of that expanse_. In speaking of what is ordinarily implied by the expression, “Universe,” I shall take a phrase of limitation—“the Universe of stars.” Why this distinction is considered necessary, will be seen in the sequel.  But even of treatises on the really limited, although always assumed as the _un_limited, Universe of _stars_, I know none in which a survey, even of this limited Universe, is so taken as to warrant deductions from its _individuality_. The nearest approach to such a work is made in the “Cosmos” of Alexander Von Humboldt. He presents the subject, however, _not_ in its individuality but in its generality. His theme, in its last result, is the law of _each_ portion of the merely physical Universe, as this law is related to the laws of _every other_ portion of this merely physical Universe. His design is simply synœretical. In a word, he discusses the universality of material relation, and discloses to the eye of Philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden _behind_ this universality. But however admirable be the succinctness with which he has treated each particular point of his topic, the mere multiplicity of these points occasions, necessarily, an amount of detail, and thus an involution of idea, which precludes all _individuality_ of impression.  It seems to me that, in aiming at this latter effect, and, through it, at the consequences—the conclusions—the suggestions—the speculations—or, if nothing better offer itself the mere guesses which may result from it—we require something like a mental gyration on the heel. We need so rapid a revolution of all things about the central point of sight that, while the minutiæ vanish altogether, even the more conspicuous objects become blended into one. Among the vanishing minutiæ, in a survey of this kind, would be all exclusively terrestrial matters. The Earth would be considered in its planetary relations alone. A man, in this view, becomes mankind; mankind a member of the cosmical family of Intelligences.  And now, before proceeding to our subject proper, let me beg the reader’s attention to an extract or two from a somewhat remarkable letter, which appears to have been found corked in a bottle and floating on the _Mare Tenebrarum_—an ocean well described by the Nubian geographer, Ptolemy Hephestion, but little frequented in modern days unless by the Transcendentalists and some other divers for crotchets. The date of this letter, I confess, surprises me even more particularly than its contents; for it seems to have been written in the year _two_ thousand eight hundred and forty-eight. As for the passages I am about to transcribe, they, I fancy, will speak for themselves.  “Do you know, my dear friend,” says the writer, addressing, no doubt, a contemporary—“Do you know that it is scarcely more than eight or nine hundred years ago since the metaphysicians first consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there exist _but two practicable roads to Truth_? Believe it if you can! It appears, however, that long, long ago, in the night of Time, there lived a Turkish philosopher called Aries and surnamed Tottle.” [Here, possibly, the letter-writer means Aristotle; the best names are wretchedly corrupted in two or three thousand years.] “The fame of this great man depended mainly upon his demonstration that sneezing is a natural provision, by means of which over-profound thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous ideas through the nose; but he obtained a scarcely less valuable celebrity as the founder, or at all events as the principal propagator, of what was termed the _de_ductive or _à priori_ philosophy. He started with what he maintained to be axioms, or self-evident truths:—and the now well understood fact that _no_ truths are _self_-evident, really does not make in the slightest degree against his speculations:—it was sufficient for his purpose that the truths in question were evident at all. From axioms he proceeded, logically, to results. His most illustrious disciples were one Tuclid, a geometrician,” [meaning Euclid] “and one Kant, a Dutchman, the originator of that species of Transcendentalism which, with the change merely of a C for a K, now bears his peculiar name.  “Well, Aries Tottle flourished supreme, until the advent of one Hog, surnamed ‘the Ettrick shepherd,’ who preached an entirely different system, which he called the _à posteriori_ or _in_ductive. His plan referred altogether to sensation. He proceeded by observing, analyzing, and classifying facts—_instantiæ Naturæ_, as they were somewhat affectedly called—and arranging them into general laws. In a word, while the mode of Aries rested on _noumena_, that of Hog depended on _phenomena_; and so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that, at its first introduction, Aries fell into general disrepute. Finally, however, he recovered ground, and was permitted to divide the empire of Philosophy with his more modern rival:—the savans contenting themselves with proscribing all _other_ competitors, past, present, and to come; putting an end to all controversy on the topic by the promulgation of a Median law, to the effect that the Aristotelian and Baconian roads are, and of right ought to be, the solo possible avenues to knowledge:—‘Baconian,’ you must know, my dear friend,” adds the letter-writer at this point, “was an adjective invented as equivalent to Hog-ian, and at the same time more dignified and euphonious.  “Now I do assure you most positively”—proceeds the epistle—“that I represent these matters fairly; and you can easily understand how restrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated, in those days, to retard the progress of true Science, which makes its most important advances—as all History will show—by seemingly intuitive _leaps_. These ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling; and I need not suggest to you that crawling, among varieties of locomotion, is a very capital thing of its kind;—but because the tortoise is sure of foot, for this reason must we clip the wings of the eagles? For many centuries, so great was the infatuation, about Hog especially, that a virtual stop was put to all thinking, properly so called. No man dared utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone. It mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably such; for the dogmatizing philosophers of that epoch regarded only _the road_ by which it professed to have been attained. The end, with them, was a point of no moment, whatever:—‘the means!’ they vociferated—‘let us look at the means!’—and if, on scrutiny of the means, it was found to come neither under the category Hog, nor under the category Aries (which means ram), why then the savans went no farther, but, calling the thinker a fool and branding him a ‘theorist,’ would never, thenceforward, have any thing to do either with _him_ or with his truths.  “Now, my dear friend,” continues the letter-writer, “it cannot be maintained that by the crawling system, exclusively adopted, men would arrive at the maximum amount of truth, even in any long series of ages; for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced even by _absolute_ certainty in the snail processes. But their certainty was very far from absolute. The error of our progenitors was quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies he must necessarily see an object the more distinctly, the more closely he holds it to his eyes. They blinded themselves, too, with the impalpable, titillating Scotch snuff of _detail_; and thus the boasted facts of the Hog-ites were by no means always facts—a point of little importance but for the assumption that they always _were_. The vital taint, however, in Baconianism—its most lamentable fount of error—lay in its tendency to throw power and consideration into the hands of merely perceptive men—of those inter-Tritonic minnows, the microscopical savans—the diggers and pedlers of minute _facts_, for the most part in physical science—facts all of which they retailed at the same price upon the highway; their value depending, it was supposed, simply upon the _fact of their fact_, without reference to their applicability or inapplicability in the development of those ultimate and only legitimate facts, called Law.  “Than the persons”—the letter goes on to say—“Than the persons thus suddenly elevated by the Hog-ian philosophy into a station for which they were unfitted—thus transferred from the sculleries into the parlors of Science—from its pantries into its pulpits—than these individuals a more intolerant—a more intolerable set of bigots and tyrants never existed on the face of the earth. Their creed, their text and their sermon were, alike, the one word ‘_fact_’—but, for the most part, even of this one word, they knew not even the meaning. On those who ventured to _disturb_ their facts with the view of putting them in order and to use, the disciples of Hog had no mercy whatever. All attempts at generalization were met at once by the words ‘theoretical,’ ‘theory,’ ‘theorist’—all _thought_, to be brief, was very properly resented as a personal affront to themselves. Cultivating the natural sciences to the exclusion of Metaphysics, the Mathematics, and Logic, many of these Bacon-engendered philosophers—one-idead, one-sided and lame of a leg—were more wretchedly helpless—more miserably ignorant, in view of all the comprehensible objects of knowledge, than the veriest unlettered hind who proves that he knows something at least, in admitting that he knows absolutely nothing.  “Nor had our forefathers any better right to talk about _certainty_, when pursuing, in blind confidence, the _à priori_ path of axioms, or of the Ram. At innumerable points this path was scarcely as straight as a ram’s-horn. The simple truth is, that the Aristotelians erected their castles upon a basis far less reliable than air; _for no such things as axioms ever existed or can possibly exist at all_. This they must have been very blind, indeed, not to see, or at least to suspect; for, even in their own day, many of their long-admitted ‘axioms’ had been abandoned:—‘_ex nihilo nihil fit_,’ for example, and a ‘thing cannot act where it is not,’ and ‘there cannot be antipodes,’ and ‘darkness cannot proceed from light.’ These and numerous similar propositions formerly accepted, without hesitation, as axioms, or undeniable truths, were, even at the period of which I speak, seen to be altogether untenable:—how absurd in these people, then, to persist in relying upon a basis, as immutable, whose mutability had become so repeatedly manifest!  “But, even through evidence afforded by themselves against themselves, it is easy to convict these _à priori_ reasoners of the grossest unreason—it is easy to show the futility—the impalpability of their axioms in general. I have now lying before me”—it will be observed that we still proceed with the letter—“I have now lying before me a book printed about a thousand years ago. Pundit assures me that it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, which is ‘Logic.’ The author, who was much esteemed in his day, was one Miller, or Mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he rode a mill-horse whom he called Jeremy Bentham:—but let us glance at the volume itself!  “Ah!—‘Ability or inability to conceive,’ says Mr. Mill very properly, ‘is _in no case_ to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth.’ Now, that this is a palpable truism no one in his senses will deny. _Not_ to admit the proposition, is to insinuate a charge of variability in Truth itself, whose very title is a synonym of the Steadfast. If ability to conceive be taken as a criterion of Truth, then a truth to _David_ Hume would very seldom be a truth to _Joe_; and ninety-nine hundredths of what is undeniable in Heaven would be demonstrable falsity upon Earth. The proposition of Mr. Mill, then, is sustained. I will not grant it to be an _axiom_; and this merely because I am showing that _no_ axioms exist; but, with a distinction which could not have been cavilled at even by Mr. Mill himself, I am ready to grant that, _if_ an axiom _there be_, then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be considered an axiom—that no _more_ absolute axiom _is_—and, consequently, that any subsequent proposition which shall conflict with this one primarily advanced, must be either a falsity in itself—that is to say no axiom—or, if admitted axiomatic, must at once neutralize both itself and its predecessor.  “And now, by the logic of their own propounder, let us proceed to test any one of the axioms propounded. Let us give Mr. Mill the fairest of play. We will bring the point to no ordinary issue. We will select for investigation no common-place axiom—no axiom of what, not the less preposterously because only impliedly, he terms his secondary class—as if a positive truth by definition could be either more or less positively a truth:—we will select, I say, no axiom of an unquestionability so questionable as is to be found in Euclid. We will not talk, for example, about such propositions as that two straight lines cannot enclose a space, or that the whole is greater than any one of its parts. We will afford the logician _every_ advantage. We will come at once to a proposition which he regards as the acme of the unquestionable—as the quintessence of axiomatic undeniability. Here it is:—‘Contradictions cannot _both_ be true—that is, cannot cöexist in nature.’ Here Mr. Mill means, for instance,—and I give the most forcible instance conceivable—that a tree must be either a tree or _not_ a tree—that it cannot be at the same time a tree _and_ not a tree:—all which is quite reasonable of itself and will answer remarkably well as an axiom, until we bring it into collation with an axiom insisted upon a few pages before—in other words—words which I have previously employed—until we test it by the logic of its own propounder. ‘A tree,’ Mr. Mill asserts, ‘must be either a tree or _not_ a tree.’ Very well:—and now let me ask him, _why_. To this little query there is but one response:—I defy any man living to invent a second. The sole answer is this:—‘Because we find it _impossible to conceive_ that a tree can be any thing else than a tree or not a tree.’ This, I repeat, is Mr. Mill’s sole answer:—he will not _pretend_ to suggest another:—and yet, by his own showing, his answer is clearly no answer at all; for has he not already required us to admit, _as an axiom_, that ability or inability to conceive is _in no case_ to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truth? Thus all—absolutely _all_ his argumentation is at sea without a rudder. Let it not be urged that an exception from the general rule is to be made, in cases where the ‘impossibility to conceive’ is so peculiarly great as when we are called upon to conceive a tree _both_ a tree and _not_ a tree. Let no attempt, I say, be made at urging this sotticism; for, in the first place, there are no _degrees_ of ‘impossibility,’ and thus no one impossible conception can be _more_ peculiarly impossible than another impossible conception:—in the second place, Mr. Mill himself, no doubt after thorough deliberation, has most distinctly, and most rationally, excluded all opportunity for exception, by the emphasis of his proposition, that, _in no case_, is ability or inability to conceive, to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truth:—in the third place, even were exceptions admissible at all, it remains to be shown how any exception is admissible _here_. That a tree can be both a tree and not a tree, is an idea which the angels, or the devils, _may_ entertain, and which no doubt many an earthly Bedlamite, or Transcendentalist, _does_.  “Now I do not quarrel with these ancients,” continues the letter-writer, “_so much_ on account of the transparent frivolity of their logic—which, to be plain, was baseless, worthless and fantastic altogether—as on account of their pompous and infatuate proscription of all _other_ roads to Truth than the two narrow and crooked paths—the one of creeping and the other of crawling—to which, in their ignorant perversity, they have dared to confine the Soul—the Soul which loves nothing so well as to soar in those regions of illimitable intuition which are utterly incognizant of ‘_path_.’  “By the bye, my dear friend, is it not an evidence of the mental slavery entailed upon those bigoted people by their Hogs and Rams, that in spite of the eternal prating of their savans about _roads_ to Truth, none of them fell, even by accident, into what we now so distinctly perceive to be the broadest, the straightest and most available of all mere roads—the great thoroughfare—the majestic highway of the _Consistent_? Is it not wonderful that they should have failed to deduce from the works of God the vitally momentous consideration that _a perfect consistency can be nothing but an absolute truth_? How plain—how rapid our progress since the late announcement of this proposition! By its means, investigation has been taken out of the hands of the ground-moles, and given as a duty, rather than as a task, to the true—to the _only_ true thinkers—to the generally-educated men of ardent imagination. These latter—our Keplers—our Laplaces—‘speculate’—‘theorize’—these are the terms—can you not fancy the shout of scorn with which they would be received by our progenitors, were it possible for them to be looking over my shoulders as I write? The Keplers, I repeat, speculate—theorize—and their theories are merely corrected—reduced—sifted—cleared, little by little, of their chaff of inconsistency—until at length there stands apparent an unencumbered _Consistency_—a consistency which the most stolid admit—because it _is_ a consistency—to be an absolute and an unquestionable _Truth_.  “I have often thought, my friend, that it must have puzzled these dogmaticians of a thousand years ago, to determine, even, by which of their two boasted roads it is that the cryptographist attains the solution of the more complicate cyphers—or by which of them Champollion guided mankind to those important and innumerable truths which, for so many centuries, have lain entombed amid the phonetical hieroglyphics of Egypt. In especial, would it not have given these bigots some trouble to determine by which of their two roads was reached the most momentous and sublime of _all_ their truths—the truth—the fact of _gravitation_? Newton deduced it from the laws of Kepler. Kepler admitted that these laws he _guessed_—these laws whose investigation disclosed to the greatest of British astronomers that principle, the basis of all (existing) physical principle, in going behind which we enter at once the nebulous kingdom of Metaphysics. Yes!—these vital laws Kepler _guessed_—that is to say, he _imagined_ them. Had he been asked to point out either the _de_ductive or _in_ductive route by which he attained them, his reply might have been—‘I know nothing about _routes_—but I _do_ know the machinery of the Universe. Here it is. I grasped it with _my soul_—I reached it through mere dint of _intuition_.’ Alas, poor ignorant old man! Could not any metaphysician have told him that what he called ‘intuition’ was but the conviction resulting from _de_ductions or _in_ductions of which the processes were so shadowy as to have escaped his consciousness, eluded his reason, or bidden defiance to his capacity of expression? How great a pity it is that some ‘moral philosopher’ had not enlightened him about all this! How it would have comforted him on his death-bed to know that, instead of having gone intuitively and thus unbecomingly, he had, in fact, proceeded decorously and legitimately—that is to say Hog-ishly, or at least Ram-ishly—into the vast halls where lay gleaming, untended, and hitherto untouched by mortal hand—unseen by mortal eye—the imperishable and priceless secrets of the Universe!  “Yes, Kepler was essentially a _theorist_; but this title, _now_ of so much sanctity, was, in those ancient days, a designation of supreme contempt. It is only _now_ that men begin to appreciate that divine old man—to sympathize with the prophetical and poetical rhapsody of his ever-memorable words. For _my_ part,” continues the unknown correspondent, “I glow with a sacred fire when I even think of them, and feel that I shall never grow weary of their repetition:—in concluding this letter, let me have the real pleasure of transcribing them once again:—‘_I care not whether my work be read now or by posterity. I can afford to wait a century for readers when God himself has waited six thousand years for an observer. I triumph. I have stolen the golden secret of the Egyptians. I will indulge my sacred fury._’”  Here end my quotations from this very unaccountable and, perhaps, somewhat impertinent epistle; and perhaps it would be folly to comment, in any respect, upon the chimerical, not to say revolutionary, fancies of the writer—whoever he is—fancies so radically at war with the well-considered and well-settled opinions of this age. Let us proceed, then, to our legitimate thesis, _The Universe_.  This thesis admits a choice between two modes of discussion:—We may _as_cend or _de_scend. Beginning at our own point of view—at the Earth on which we stand—we may pass to the other planets of our system—thence to the Sun—thence to our system considered collectively—and thence, through other systems, indefinitely outwards; or, commencing on high at some point as definite as we can make it or conceive it, we may come down to the habitation of Man. Usually—that is to say, in ordinary essays on Astronomy—the first of these two modes is, with certain reservation, adopted:—this for the obvious reason that astronomical _facts_, merely, and principles, being the object, that object is best fulfilled in stepping from the known because proximate, gradually onward to the point where all certitude becomes lost in the remote. For my present purpose, however,—that of enabling the mind to take in, as if from afar and at one glance, a distinct conception of the _individual_ Universe—it is clear that a descent to small from great—to the outskirts from the centre (if we could establish a centre)—to the end from the beginning (if we could fancy a beginning) would be the preferable course, but for the difficulty, if not impossibility, of presenting, in this course, to the unastronomical, a picture at all comprehensible in regard to such considerations as are involved in _quantity_—that is to say, in number, magnitude and distance.  Now, distinctness—intelligibility, at all points, is a primary feature in my general design. On important topics it is better to be a good deal prolix than even a very little obscure. But abstruseness is a quality appertaining to no subject _per se_. All are alike, in facility of comprehension, to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps. It is merely because a stepping-stone, here and there, is heedlessly left unsupplied in our road to the Differential Calculus, that this latter is not altogether as simple a thing as a sonnet by Mr. Solomon Seesaw.  By way of admitting, then, no _chance_ for misapprehension, I think it advisable to proceed as if even the more obvious facts of Astronomy were unknown to the reader. In combining the two modes of discussion to which I have referred, I propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar to each—and very especially of the _iteration in detail_ which will be unavoidable as a consequence of the plan. Commencing with a descent, I shall reserve for the return upwards those indispensable considerations of _quantity_ to which allusion has already been made.  Let us begin, then, at once, with that merest of words, “Infinity.” This, like “God,” “spirit,” and some other expressions of which the equivalents exist in all languages, is by no means the expression of an idea—but of an effort at one. It stands for the possible attempt at an impossible conception. Man needed a term by which to point out the _direction_ of this effort—the cloud behind which lay, forever invisible, the _object_ of this attempt. A word, in fine, was demanded, by means of which one human being might put himself in relation at once with another human being and with a certain _tendency_ of the human intellect. Out of this demand arose the word, “Infinity;” which is thus the representative but of the _thought of a thought_.  As regards _that_ infinity now considered—the infinity of space—we often hear it said that “its idea is admitted by the mind—is acquiesced in—is entertained—on account of the greater difficulty which attends the conception of a limit.” But this is merely one of those _phrases_ by which even profound thinkers, time out of mind, have occasionally taken pleasure in deceiving _themselves_. The quibble lies concealed in the word “difficulty.” “The mind,” we are told, “entertains the idea of _limitless_, through the greater _difficulty_ which it finds in entertaining that of _limited_, space.” Now, were the proposition but fairly _put_, its absurdity would become transparent at once. Clearly, there is no mere _difficulty_ in the case. The assertion intended, if presented _according_ to its intention and without sophistry, would run thus:—“The mind admits the idea of limitless, through the greater _impossibility_ of entertaining that of limited, space.”  It must be immediately seen that this is not a question of two statements between whose respective credibilities—or of two arguments between whose respective validities—the _reason_ is called upon to decide:—it is a matter of two conceptions, directly conflicting, and each avowedly impossible, one of which the _intellect_ is supposed to be capable of entertaining, on account of the greater _impossibility_ of entertaining the other. The choice is _not_ made between two difficulties;—it is merely _fancied_ to be made between two impossibilities. Now of the former, there _are_ degrees—but of the latter, none:—just as our impertinent letter-writer has already suggested. A task _may_ be more or less difficult; but it is either possible or not possible:—there are no gradations. It _might_ be more _difficult_ to overthrow the Andes than an ant-hill; but it _can_ be no more _impossible_ to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of the other. A man may jump ten feet with less _difficulty_ than he can jump twenty, but the _impossibility_ of his leaping to the moon is not a whit less than that of his leaping to the dog-star.  Since all this is undeniable: since the choice of the mind is to be made between _impossibilities_ of conception: since one impossibility cannot be greater than another: and since, thus, one cannot be preferred to another: the philosophers who not only maintain, on the grounds mentioned, man’s _idea_ of infinity but, on account of such supposititious idea, _infinity itself_—are plainly engaged in demonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is that some one other thing—is impossible too. This, it will be said, is nonsense; and perhaps it is:—indeed I think it very capital nonsense—but forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine.  The readiest mode, however, of displaying the fallacy of the philosophical argument on this question, is by simply adverting to a _fact_ respecting it which has been hitherto quite overlooked—the fact that the argument alluded to both proves and disproves its own proposition. “The mind is impelled,” say the theologians and others, “to admit a _First Cause_, by the superior difficulty it experiences in conceiving cause beyond cause without end.” The quibble, as before, lies in the word “difficulty”—but _here_ what is it employed to sustain? A First Cause. And what is a First Cause? An ultimate termination of causes. And what is an ultimate termination of causes? Finity—the Finite. Thus the one quibble, in two processes, by God knows how many philosophers, is made to support now Finity and now Infinity—could it not be brought to support something besides? As for the quibblers—_they_, at least, are insupportable. But—to dismiss them:—what they prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they demonstrate in the other.  Of course, no one will suppose that I here contend for the absolute impossibility of _that_ which we attempt to convey in the word “Infinity.” My purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove Infinity itself or even our conception of it, by any such blundering ratiocination as that which is ordinarily employed.  Nevertheless, as an individual, I may be permitted to say that _I cannot_ conceive Infinity, and am convinced that no human being can. A mind not thoroughly self-conscious—not accustomed to the introspective analysis of its own operations—will, it is true, often deceive itself by supposing that it _has_ entertained the conception of which we speak. In the effort to entertain it, we proceed step beyond step—we fancy point still beyond point; and so long as we _continue_ the effort, it may be said, in fact, that we are _tending_ to the formation of the idea designed; while the strength of the impression that we actually form or have formed it, is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up the mental endeavor. But it is in the act of discontinuing the endeavor—of fulfilling (as we think) the idea—of putting the finishing stroke (as we suppose) to the conception—that we overthrow at once the whole fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and therefore definite point. This fact, however, we fail to perceive, on account of the absolute coincidence, in time, between the settling down upon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in thinking.—In attempting, on the other hand, to frame the idea of a _limited_ space, we merely converse the processes which involve the impossibility.  We _believe_ in a God. We may or may not _believe_ in finite or in infinite space; but our belief, in such cases, is more properly designated as _faith_, and is a matter quite distinct from that belief proper—from that _intellectual_ belief—which presupposes the mental conception.  The fact is, that, upon the enunciation of any one of that class of terms to which “Infinity” belongs—the class representing _thoughts of thought_—he who has a right to say that he thinks _at all_, feels himself called upon, _not_ to entertain a conception, but simply to direct his mental vision toward some given point, in the intellectual firmament, where lies a nebula never to be resolved. To solve it, indeed, he makes no effort; for with a rapid instinct he comprehends, not only the impossibility, but, as regards all human purposes, the _inessentiality_, of its solution. He perceives that the Deity has not _designed_ it to be solved. He sees, at once, that it lies _out_ of the brain of man, and even _how_, if not exactly _why_, it lies out of it. There _are_ people, I am aware, who, busying themselves in attempts at the unattainable, acquire very easily, by dint of the jargon they emit, among those thinkers-that-they-think with whom darkness and depth are synonymous, a kind of cuttle-fish reputation for profundity; but the finest quality of Thought is its self-cognizance; and, with some little equivocation, it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater than that which, extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain, shuts out even these boundaries themselves from comprehension.  It will now be understood that, in using the phrase, “Infinity of Space,” I make no call upon the reader to entertain the impossible conception of an _absolute_ infinity. I refer simply to the “_utmost conceivable expanse_” of space—a shadowy and fluctuating domain, now shrinking, now swelling, in accordance with the vacillating energies of the imagination.  _Hitherto_, the Universe of stars has always been considered as coincident with the Universe proper, as I have defined it in the commencement of this Discourse. It has been always either directly or indirectly assumed—at least since the dawn of intelligible Astronomy—that, were it possible for us to attain any given point in space, we should still find, on all sides of us, an interminable succession of stars. This was the untenable idea of Pascal when making perhaps the most successful attempt ever made, at periphrasing the conception for which we struggle in the word “Universe.” “It is a sphere,” he says, “of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference, nowhere.” But although this intended definition is, in fact, _no_ definition of the Universe of _stars_, we may accept it, with some mental reservation, as a definition (rigorous enough for all practical purposes) of the Universe _proper_—that is to say, of the Universe of _space_. This latter, then, let us regard as “_a sphere of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference nowhere_.” In fact, while we find it impossible to fancy an _end_ to space, we have no difficulty in picturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of _beginnings_.  As our starting-point, then, let us adopt the _Godhead_. Of this Godhead, _in itself_, he alone is not imbecile—he alone is not impious who propounds—nothing. “_Nous ne connaissons rien_,” says the Baron de Bielfeld—“_Nous ne connaissons rien de la nature ou de l’essence de Dieu:—pour savoir ce qu’il est, il faut être Dieu même._”—“We know absolutely _nothing_ of the nature or essence of God:—in order to comprehend what he is, we should have to be God ourselves.”  “_We should have to be God ourselves!_”—With a phrase so startling as this yet ringing in my ears, I nevertheless venture to demand if this our present ignorance of the Deity is an ignorance to which the soul is _everlastingly_ condemned.  By _Him_, however—_now_, at least, the Incomprehensible—by Him—assuming him as _Spirit_—that is to say, as _not Matter_—a distinction which, for all intelligible purposes, will stand well instead of a definition—by Him, then, existing as Spirit, let us content ourselves, to-night, with supposing to have been _created_, or made out of Nothing, by dint of his Volition—at some point of Space which we will take as a centre—at some period into which we do not pretend to inquire, but at all events immensely remote—by Him, then again, let us suppose to have been created——_what_? This is a vitally momentous epoch in our considerations. _What_ is it that we are justified—that alone we are justified in supposing to have been, primarily and solely, _created_?  We have attained a point where only _Intuition_ can aid us:—but now let me recur to the idea which I have already suggested as that alone which we can properly entertain of intuition. It is but _the conviction arising from those inductions or deductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to escape our consciousness, elude our reason, or defy our capacity of expression_. With this understanding, I now assert—that an intuition altogether irresistible, although inexpressible, forces me to the conclusion that what God originally created—that that Matter which, by dint of his Volition, he first made from his Spirit, or from Nihility, _could_ have been nothing but Matter in its utmost conceivable state of——what?—of _Simplicity_?  This will be found the sole absolute _assumption_ of my Discourse. I use the word “assumption” in its ordinary sense; yet I maintain that even this my primary proposition, is very, very far indeed, from being really a mere assumption. Nothing was ever more certainly—no human conclusion was ever, in fact, more regularly—more rigorously _de_duced:—but, alas! the processes lie out of the human analysis—at all events are beyond the utterance of the human tongue.  Let us now endeavor to conceive what Matter must be, when, or if, in its absolute extreme of _Simplicity_. Here the Reason flies at once to Imparticularity—to a particle—to _one_ particle—a particle of _one_ kind—of _one_ character—of _one_ nature—of _one size_—of one form—a particle, therefore, “_without_ form and void”—a particle positively a particle at all points—a particle absolutely unique, individual, undivided, and not indivisible only because He who _created_ it, by dint of his Will, can by an infinitely less energetic exercise of the same Will, as a matter of course, divide it.  _Oneness_, then, is all that I predicate of the originally created Matter; but I propose to show that this _Oneness is a principle abundantly sufficient to account for the constitution, the existing phænomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the material Universe_.  The willing into being the primordial particle, has completed the act, or more properly the _conception_, of Creation. We now proceed to the ultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the Particle created—that is to say, the ultimate purpose so far as our considerations _yet_ enable us to see it—the constitution of the Universe from it, the Particle.  This constitution has been effected by _forcing_ the originally and therefore normally _One_ into the abnormal condition of _Many_. An action of this character implies rëaction. A diffusion from Unity, under the conditions, involves a tendency to return into Unity—a tendency ineradicable until satisfied. But on these points I will speak more fully hereafter.  The assumption of absolute Unity in the primordial Particle includes that of infinite divisibility. Let us conceive the Particle, then, to be only not totally exhausted by diffusion into Space. From the one Particle, as a centre, let us suppose to be irradiated spherically—in all directions—to immeasurable but still to definite distances in the previously vacant space—a certain inexpressibly great yet limited number of unimaginably yet not infinitely minute atoms.  Now, of these atoms, thus diffused, or upon diffusion, what conditions are we permitted—not to assume, but to infer, from consideration as well of their source as of the character of the design apparent in their diffusion? _Unity_ being their source, and _difference from Unity_ the character of the design manifested in their diffusion, we are warranted in supposing this character to be at least _generally_ preserved throughout the design, and to form a portion of the design itself:—that is to say, we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at all points from the uniquity and simplicity of the origin. But, for these reasons, shall we be justified in imagining the atoms heterogeneous, dissimilar, unequal, and inequidistant? More explicitly—are we to consider no two atoms as, at their diffusion, of the same nature, or of the same form, or of the same size?—and, after fulfilment of their diffusion into Space, is absolute inequidistance, each from each, to be understood of all of them? In such arrangement, under such conditions, we most easily and immediately comprehend the subsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design as that which I have suggested—the design of variety out of unity—diversity out of sameness—heterogeneity out of homogeneity—complexity out of simplicity—in a word, the utmost possible multiplicity of _relation_ out of the emphatically irrelative _One_. Undoubtedly, therefore, we _should_ be warranted in assuming all that has been mentioned, but for the reflection, first, that supererogation is not presumable of any Divine Act; and, secondly, that the object supposed in view, appears as feasible when some of the conditions in question are dispensed with, in the beginning, as when all are understood immediately to exist. I mean to say that some are involved in the rest, or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the distinction inappreciable. Difference of _size_, for example, will at once be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second, in preference to a third, on account of particular inequidistance; which is to be comprehended as _particular inequidistances between centres of quantity, in neighboring atoms of different form_—a matter not at all interfering with the generally-equable distribution of the atoms. Difference of _kind_, too, is easily conceived to be merely a result of differences in size and form, taken more or less conjointly:—in fact, since the _Unity_ of the Particle Proper implies absolute homogeneity, we cannot imagine the atoms, at their diffusion, differing in kind, without imagining, at the same time, a special exercise of the Divine Will, at the emission of each atom, for the purpose of effecting, in each, a change of its essential nature:—so fantastic an idea is the less to be indulged, as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly attainable without such minute and elaborate interposition. We perceive, therefore, upon the whole, that it would be supererogatory, and consequently unphilosophical, to predicate of the atoms, in view of their purposes, any thing more than _difference of form_ at their dispersion, with particular inequidistance after it—all other differences arising at once out of these, in the very first processes of mass-constitution:—We thus establish the Universe on a purely _geometrical_ basis. Of course, it is by no means necessary to assume absolute difference, even of form, among _all_ the atoms irradiated—any more than absolute particular inequidistance of each from each. We are required to conceive merely that no _neighboring_ atoms are of similar form—no atoms which can ever approximate, until their inevitable rëunition at the end.  Although the immediate and perpetual _tendency_ of the disunited atoms to return into their normal Unity, is implied, as I have said, in their abnormal diffusion; still it is clear that this tendency will be without consequence—a tendency and no more—until the diffusive energy, in ceasing to be exerted, shall leave _it_, the tendency, free to seek its satisfaction. The Divine Act, however, being considered as determinate, and discontinued on fulfilment of the diffusion, we understand, at once, a _rëaction_—in other words, a _satisfiable_ tendency of the disunited atoms to return into _One_.  But the diffusive energy being withdrawn, and the rëaction having commenced in furtherance of the ultimate design—_that of the utmost possible Relation_—this design is now in danger of being frustrated, in detail, by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect its accomplishment in general. _Multiplicity_ is the object; but there is nothing to prevent proximate atoms, from lapsing _at once_, through the now satisfiable tendency—_before_ the fulfilment of any ends proposed in multiplicity—into absolute oneness among themselves:—there is nothing to impede the aggregation of various _unique_ masses, at various points of space:—in other words, nothing to interfere with the accumulation of various masses, each absolutely One.  For the effectual and thorough completion of the general design, we thus see the necessity for a repulsion of limited capacity—a separative _something_ which, on withdrawal of the diffusive Volition, shall at the same time allow the approach, and forbid the junction, of the atoms; suffering them infinitely to approximate, while denying them positive contact; in a word, having the power—_up to a certain epoch_—of preventing their _coalition_, but no ability to interfere with their _coalescence_ in any respect _or degree_. The repulsion, already considered as so peculiarly limited in other regards, must be understood, let me repeat, as having power to prevent absolute coalition, _only up to a certain epoch_. Unless we are to conceive that the appetite for Unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied _never_;—unless we are to conceive that what had a beginning is to have no end—a conception which cannot _really_ be entertained, however much we may talk or dream of entertaining it—we are forced to conclude that the repulsive influence imagined, will, finally—under pressure of the _Unitendency collectively_ applied, but never and in no degree _until_, on fulfilment of the Divine purposes, such collective application shall be naturally made—yield to a force which, at that ultimate epoch, shall be the superior force precisely to the extent required, and thus permit the universal subsidence into the inevitable, because original and therefore normal, _One_.—The conditions here to be reconciled are difficult indeed:—we cannot even comprehend the possibility of their conciliation;—nevertheless, the apparent impossibility is brilliantly suggestive.  That the repulsive something actually exists, _we see_. Man neither employs, nor knows, a force sufficient to bring two atoms into contact. This is but the well-established proposition of the impenetrability of matter. All Experiment proves—all Philosophy admits it. The _design_ of the repulsion—the necessity for its existence—I have endeavored to show; but from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously abstained; this on account of an intuitive conviction that the principle at issue is strictly spiritual—lies in a recess impervious to our present understanding—lies involved in a consideration of what now—in our human state—is _not_ to be considered—in a consideration of _Spirit in itself_. I feel, in a word, that here the God has interposed, and here only, because here and here only the knot demanded the interposition of the God.  In fact, while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into Unity, will be recognized, at once, as the principle of the Newtonian Gravity, what I have spoken of as a repulsive influence prescribing limits to the (immediate) satisfaction of the tendency, will be understood as _that_ which we have been in the practice of designating now as heat, now as magnetism, now as _electricity_; displaying our ignorance of its awful character in the vacillation of the phraseology with which we endeavor to circumscribe it.  Calling it, merely for the moment, electricity, we know that all experimental analysis of electricity has given, as an ultimate result, the principle, or seeming principle, _heterogeneity_. _Only_ where things differ is electricity apparent; and it is presumable that they _never_ differ where it is not developed at least, if not apparent. Now, this result is in the fullest keeping with that which I have reached unempirically. The design of the repulsive influence I have maintained to be that of preventing immediate Unity among the diffused atoms; and these atoms are represented as different each from each. _Difference_ is their character—their essentiality—just as _no-difference_ was the essentiality of their source. When we say, then, that an attempt to bring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort, on the part of the repulsive influence, to prevent the contact, we may as well use the strictly convertible sentence that an attempt to bring together any two differences will result in a development of electricity. All existing bodies, of course, are composed of these atoms in proximate contact, and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more or fewer differences; and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit, on bringing together any two such assemblages, would be in the ratio of the two sums of the differences in each:—an expression which, when reduced, is equivalent to this:—_The amount of electricity developed on the approximation of two bodies, is proportional to the difference between the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are composed._ That _no_ two bodies are absolutely alike, is a simple corollary from all that has been here said. Electricity, therefore, existing always, is _developed_ whenever _any_ bodies, but _manifested_ only when bodies of appreciable difference, are brought into approximation.  To electricity—so, for the present, continuing to call it—we _may_ not be wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light, heat and magnetism; but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to this strictly spiritual principle the more important phænomena of vitality, consciousness and _Thought_. On this topic, however, I need pause _here_ merely to suggest that these phænomena, whether observed generally or in detail, seem to proceed _at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous_.  Discarding now the two equivocal terms, “gravitation” and “electricity,” let us adopt the more definite expressions, “_attraction_” and “_repulsion_.” The former is the body; the latter the soul: the one is the material; the other the spiritual, principle of the Universe. _No other principles exist._ _All_ phænomena are referable to one, or to the other, or to both combined. So rigorously is this the case—so thoroughly demonstrable is it that attraction and repulsion are the _sole_ properties through which we perceive the Universe—in other words, by which Matter is manifested to Mind—that, for all merely argumentative purposes, we are fully justified in assuming that matter _exists_ only as attraction and repulsion—that attraction and repulsion _are_ matter:—there being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term “matter” and the terms “attraction” and “repulsion,” taken together, as equivalent, and therefore convertible, expressions in Logic.  I said, just now, that what I have described as the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into their original unity, would be understood as the principle of the Newtonian law of gravity: and, in fact, there can be little difficulty in such an understanding, if we look at the Newtonian gravity in a merely general view, as a force impelling matter to seek matter; that is to say, when we pay no attention to the known _modus operandi_ of the Newtonian force. The general coincidence satisfies us; but, upon looking closely, we see, in detail, much that appears _in_coincident, and much in regard to which no coincidence, at least, is established. For example; the Newtonian gravity, when we think of it in certain moods, does _not_ seem to be a tendency to _oneness_ at all, but rather a tendency of all bodies in all directions—a phrase apparently expressive of a tendency to diffusion. Here, then, is an _in_coincidence. Again; when we reflect on the mathematical _law_ governing the Newtonian tendency, we see clearly that no coincidence has been made good, in respect of the _modus operandi_, at least, between gravitation as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct tendency which I have assumed.  In fact, I have attained a point at which it will be advisable to strengthen my position by reversing my processes. So far, we have gone on _à priori_, from an abstract consideration of _Simplicity_, as that quality most likely to have characterized the original action of God. Let us now see whether the established facts of the Newtonian Gravitation may not afford us, _à posteriori_, some legitimate inductions.  What does the Newtonian law declare?—That all bodies attract each other with forces proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the squares of their distances. Purposely, I have here given, in the first place, the vulgar version of the law; and I confess that in this, as in most other vulgar versions of great truths, we find little of a suggestive character. Let us now adopt a more philosophical phraseology:—_Every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances between the attracting and attracted atom._—Here, indeed, a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind.  But let us see distinctly what it was that Newton _proved_—according to the grossly irrational definitions of _proof_ prescribed by the metaphysical schools. He was forced to content himself with showing how thoroughly the motions of an imaginary Universe, composed of attracting and attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced, coincide with those of the actually existing Universe so far as it comes under our observation. This was the amount of his _demonstration_—that is to say, this was the amount of it, according to the conventional cant of the “philosophies.” His successes added proof multiplied by proof—such proof as a sound intellect admits—but the _demonstration_ of the law itself, persist the metaphysicians, had not been strengthened in any degree. “_Ocular_, _physical_ proof,” however, of attraction, here upon Earth, in accordance with the Newtonian theory, was, at length, much to the satisfaction of some intellectual grovellers, afforded. This proof arose collaterally and incidentally (as nearly all important truths have arisen) out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the Earth. In the famous Maskelyne, Cavendish and Bailly experiments for this purpose, the attraction of the mass of a mountain was seen, felt, measured, and found to be mathematically consistent with the immortal theory of the British astronomer.  But in spite of this confirmation of that which needed none—in spite of the so-called corroboration of the “theory” by the so-called “ocular and physical proof”—in spite of the _character_ of this corroboration—the ideas which even really philosophical men cannot help imbibing of gravity—and, especially, the ideas of it which ordinary men get and contentedly maintain, are _seen_ to have been derived, for the most part, from a consideration of the principle as they find it developed—_merely in the planet upon which they stand_.  Now, to what does so partial a consideration tend—to what species of error does it give rise? On the Earth we _see_ and _feel_, only that gravity impels all bodies towards the _centre_ of the Earth. No man in the common walks of life could be _made_ to see or to feel anything else—could be made to perceive that anything, anywhere, has a perpetual, gravitating tendency in any _other_ direction than to the centre of the Earth; yet (with an exception hereafter to be specified) it is a fact that every earthly thing (not to speak now of every heavenly thing) has a tendency not _only_ to the Earth’s centre but in every conceivable direction besides.  Now, although the philosophic cannot be said to _err with_ the vulgar in this matter, they nevertheless permit themselves to be influenced, without knowing it, by the _sentiment_ of the vulgar idea. “Although the Pagan fables are not believed,” says Bryant, in his very erudite “Mythology,” “yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as from existing realities.” I mean to assert that the merely _sensitive perception_ of gravity as we experience it on Earth, beguiles mankind into the fancy of _concentralization_ or _especiality_ respecting it—has been continually biasing towards this fancy even the mightiest intellects—perpetually, although imperceptibly, leading them away from the real characteristics of the principle; thus preventing them, up to this date, from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth which lies in a diametrically opposite direction—behind the principle’s _essential_ characteristics—those, _not_ of concentralization or especiality—but of _universality_ and _diffusion_. This “vital truth” is _Unity_ as the _source_ of the phænomenon.  Let me now repeat the definition of gravity:—_Every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body_, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of the attracting and attracted atom.  Here let the reader pause with me, for a moment, in contemplation of the miraculous—of the ineffable—of the altogether unimaginable complexity of relation involved in the fact that _each atom attracts every other atom_—involved merely in this fact of the attraction, without reference to the law or mode in which the attraction is manifested—involved _merely_ in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom _at all_, in a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the composition of a cannon-ball, exceed, probably, in mere point of number, all the stars which go to the constitution of the Universe.  Had we discovered, simply, that each atom tended to some one favorite point—to some especially attractive atom—we should still have fallen upon a discovery which, in itself, would have sufficed to overwhelm the mind:—but what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend? That each atom attracts—sympathizes with the most delicate movements of every other atom, and with each and with all at the same time, and forever, and according to a determinate law of which the complexity, even considered by itself solely, is utterly beyond the grasp of the imagination of man. If I propose to ascertain the influence of one mote in a sunbeam upon its neighboring mote, I cannot accomplish my purpose without first counting and weighing all the atoms in the Universe and defining the precise positions of all at one particular moment. If I venture to displace, by even the billionth part of an inch, the microscopical speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my finger, what is the character of that act upon which I have adventured? I have done a deed which shakes the Moon in her path, which causes the Sun to be no longer the Sun, and which alters forever the destiny of the multitudinous myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic presence of their Creator.  _These_ ideas—conceptions such as _these_—unthoughtlike thoughts—soul-reveries rather than conclusions or even considerations of the intellect:—ideas, I repeat, such as these, are such as we can alone hope profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great principle, _Attraction_.  But now,—_with_ such ideas—with such a _vision_ of the marvellous complexity of Attraction fairly in his mind—let any person competent of thought on such topics as these, set himself to the task of imagining a _principle_ for the phænomena observed—a condition from which they sprang.  Does not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common parentage? Does not a sympathy so omniprevalent, so ineradicable, and so thoroughly irrespective, suggest a common paternity as its source? Does not one extreme impel the reason to the other? Does not the infinitude of division refer to the utterness of individuality? Does not the entireness of the complex hint at the perfection of the simple? It is _not_ that the atoms, as we see them, are divided or that they are complex in their relations—but that they are inconceivably divided and unutterably complex:—it is the extremeness of the conditions to which I now allude, rather than to the conditions themselves. In a word, is it not because the atoms were, at some remote epoch of time, even _more than together_—is it not because originally, and therefore normally, they were _One_—that now, in all circumstances—at all points—in all directions—by all modes of approach—in all relations and through all conditions—they struggle _back_ to this absolutely, this irrelatively, this unconditionally _one_?  Some person may here demand:—“Why—since it is to the _One_ that the atoms struggle back—do we not find and define Attraction ‘a merely general tendency to a centre?’—why, in especial, do not _your_ atoms—the atoms which you describe as having been irradiated from a centre—proceed at once, rectilinearly, back to the central point of their origin?”  I reply that _they do_; as will be distinctly shown; but that the cause of their so doing is quite irrespective of the centre _as such_. They all tend rectilinearly towards a centre, because of the sphereicity with which they have been irradiated into space. Each atom, forming one of a generally uniform globe of atoms, finds more atoms in the direction of the centre, of course, than in any other, and in that direction, therefore, is impelled—but is _not_ thus impelled because the centre is _the point of its origin_. It is not to any _point_ that the atoms are allied. It is not any _locality_, either in the concrete or in the abstract, to which I suppose them bound. Nothing like _location_ was conceived as their origin. Their source lies in the principle, _Unity_. _This_ is their lost parent. _This_ they seek always—immediately—in all directions—wherever it is even partially to be found; thus appeasing, in some measure, the ineradicable tendency, while on the way to its absolute satisfaction in the end. It follows from all this, that any principle which shall be adequate to account for the _law_, or _modus operandi_, of the attractive force in general, will account for this law in particular:—that is to say, any principle which will show why the atoms should tend to their _general centre of irradiation_ with forces inversely proportional to the squares of the distances, will be admitted as satisfactorily accounting, at the same time, for the tendency, according to the same law, of these atoms each to each:—_for_ the tendency to the centre _is_ merely the tendency each to each, and not any tendency to a centre as such.—Thus it will be seen, also, that the establishment of my propositions would involve no _necessity_ of modification in the terms of the Newtonian definition of Gravity, which declares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth, and declares this merely; but (always under the supposition that what I propose be, in the end, admitted) it seems clear that some error might occasionally be avoided, in the future processes of Science, were a more ample phraseology adopted:—for instance:—“Each atom tends to every other atom &c. with a force &c.: _the general result being a tendency of all, with a similar force, to a general centre_.”  The reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical result; but, while in the one process _intuition_ was the starting-point, in the other it was the goal. In commencing the former journey I could only say that, with an irresistible intuition, I _felt_ Simplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of God:—in ending the latter I can only declare that, with an irresistible intuition, I perceive Unity to have been the source of the observed phænomena of the Newtonian gravitation. Thus, according to the schools, I _prove_ nothing. So be it:—I design but to suggest—and to _convince_ through the suggestion. I am proudly aware that there exist many of the most profound and cautiously discriminative human intellects which cannot _help_ being abundantly content with my—suggestions. To these intellects—as to my own—there is no mathematical demonstration which _could_ bring the least additional _true proof_ of the great _Truth_ which I have advanced—_the truth of Original Unity as the source—as the principle of the Universal Phænomena_. For my part, I am not so sure that I speak and see—I am not so sure that my heart beats and that my soul lives:—of the rising of to-morrow’s sun—a probability that as yet lies in the Future—I do not pretend to be one thousandth part as sure—as I am of the irretrievably by-gone _Fact_ that All Things and All Thoughts of Things, with all their ineffable Multiplicity of Relation, sprang at once into being from the primordial and irrelative _One_.  Referring to the Newtonian Gravity, Dr. Nichol, the eloquent author of “The Architecture of the Heavens,” says:—“In truth we have no reason to suppose this great Law, as now revealed, to be the ultimate or simplest, and therefore the universal and all-comprehensive, form of a great Ordinance. The mode in which its intensity diminishes with the element of distance, has not the aspect of an ultimate _principle_; which always assumes the simplicity and self-evidence of those axioms which constitute the basis of Geometry.”  Now, it is quite true that “ultimate principles,” in the common understanding of the words, always assume the simplicity of geometrical axioms—(as for “self-evidence,” there is no such thing)—but these principles are clearly _not_ “ultimate;” in other terms what we are in the habit of calling principles are no principles, properly speaking—since there can be but one _principle_, the Volition of God. We have no right to assume, then, from what we observe in rules that we choose foolishly to name “principles,” anything at all in respect to the characteristics of a principle proper. The “ultimate principles” of which Dr. Nichol speaks as having geometrical simplicity, may and do have this geometrical turn, as being part and parcel of a vast geometrical system, and thus a system of simplicity itself—in which, nevertheless, the _truly_ ultimate principle is, _as we know_, the consummation of the complex—that is to say, of the unintelligible—for is it not the Spiritual Capacity of God?  I quoted Dr. Nichol’s remark, however, not so much to question its philosophy, as by way of calling attention to the fact that, while all men have admitted _some_ principle as existing behind the Law of Gravity, no attempt has been yet made to point out what this principle in particular _is_:—if we except, perhaps, occasional fantastic efforts at referring it to Magnetism, or Mesmerism, or Swedenborgianism, or Transcendentalism, or some other equally delicious _ism_ of the same species, and invariably patronized by one and the same species of people. The great mind of Newton, while boldly grasping the Law itself, shrank from the principle of the Law. The more fluent and comprehensive at least, if not the more patient and profound, sagacity of Laplace, had not the courage to attack it. But hesitation on the part of these two astronomers it is, perhaps, not so very difficult to understand. They, as well as all the first class of mathematicians, were mathematicians _solely_:—their intellect, at least, had a firmly-pronounced mathematico-physical tone. What lay not distinctly within the domain of Physics, or of Mathematics, seemed to them either Non-Entity or Shadow. Nevertheless, we may well wonder that Leibnitz, who was a marked exception to the general rule in these respects, and whose mental temperament was a singular admixture of the mathematical with the physico-metaphysical, did not at once investigate and establish the point at issue. Either Newton or Laplace, seeking a principle and discovering none _physical_, would have rested contentedly in the conclusion that there was absolutely none; but it is almost impossible to fancy, of Leibnitz, that, having exhausted in his search the physical dominions, he would not have stepped at once, boldly and hopefully, amid his old familiar haunts in the kingdom of Metaphysics. Here, indeed, it is clear that he _must_ have adventured in search of the treasure:—that he did not find it after all, was, perhaps, because his fairy guide, Imagination, was not sufficiently well-grown, or well-educated, to direct him aright.  I observed, just now, that, in fact, there had been certain vague attempts at referring Gravity to some very uncertain _isms_. These attempts, however, although considered bold and justly so considered, looked no farther than to the generality—the merest generality—of the Newtonian Law. Its _modus operandi_ has never, to my knowledge, been approached in the way of an effort at explanation. It is, therefore, with no unwarranted fear of being taken for a madman at the outset, and before I can bring my propositions fairly to the eye of those who alone are competent to decide upon them, that I here declare the _modus operandi_ of the Law of Gravity to be an exceedingly simple and perfectly explicable thing—that is to say, when we make our advances towards it in just gradations and in the true direction—when we regard it from the proper point of view.  Whether we reach the idea of absolute _Unity_ as the source of All Things, from a consideration of Simplicity as the most probable characteristic of the original action of God;—whether we arrive at it from an inspection of the universality of relation in the gravitating phænomena;—or whether we attain it as a result of the mutual corroboration afforded by both processes;—still, the idea itself, if entertained at all, is entertained in inseparable connection with another idea—that of the condition of the Universe of stars as we _now_ perceive it—that is to say, a condition of immeasurable _diffusion_ through space. Now a connection between these two ideas—unity and diffusion—cannot be established unless through the entertainment of a third idea—that of _irradiation_. Absolute Unity being taken as a centre, then the existing Universe of stars is the result of _irradiation_ from that centre.  Now, the laws of irradiation are _known_. They are part and parcel of the _sphere_. They belong to the class of _indisputable geometrical properties_. We say of them, “they are true—they are evident.” To demand _why_ they are true, would be to demand why the axioms are true upon which their demonstration is based. _Nothing_ is demonstrable, strictly speaking; but _if_ anything _be_, then the properties—the laws in question are demonstrated.  But these laws—what do they declare? Irradiation—how—by what steps does it proceed outwardly from a centre?  From a _luminous_ centre, _Light_ issues by irradiation; and the quantities of light received upon any given plane, supposed to be shifting its position so as to be now nearer the centre and now farther from it, will be diminished in the same proportion as the squares of the distances of the plane from the luminous body, are increased; and will be increased in the same proportion as these squares are diminished.  The expression of the law may be thus generalized:—the number of light-particles (or, if the phrase be preferred, the number of light-impressions) received upon the shifting plane, will be _inversely_ proportional with the squares of the distances of the plane. Generalizing yet again, we may say that the diffusion—the scattering—the irradiation, in a word—is _directly_ proportional with the squares of the distances.  [Illustration]  For example: at the distance B, from the luminous centre A, a certain number of particles are so diffused as to occupy the surface B. Then at double the distance—that is to say at C—they will be so much farther diffused as to occupy four such surfaces:—at treble the distance, or at D, they will be so much farther separated as to occupy nine such surfaces:—while, at quadruple the distance, or at E, they will have become so scattered as to spread themselves over sixteen such surfaces—and so on forever.  In saying, generally, that the irradiation proceeds in direct proportion with the squares of the distances, we use the term irradiation to express _the degree of the diffusion_ as we proceed outwardly from the centre. Conversing the idea, and employing the word “concentralization” to express _the degree of the drawing together_ as we come back toward the centre from an outward position, we may say that concentralization proceeds _inversely_ as the squares of the distances. In other words, we have reached the conclusion that, on the hypothesis that matter was originally irradiated from a centre and is now returning to it, the concentralization, in the return, proceeds _exactly as we know the force of gravitation to proceed_.  Now here, if we could be permitted to assume that concentralization exactly represented the _force of the tendency to the centre_—that the one was exactly proportional to the other, and that the two proceeded together—we should have shown all that is required. The sole difficulty existing, then, is to establish a direct proportion between “concentralization” and the _force_ of concentralization; and this is done, of course, if we establish such proportion between “irradiation” and the _force_ of irradiation.  A very slight inspection of the Heavens assures us that the stars have a certain general uniformity, equability, or equidistance, of distribution through that region of space in which, collectively, and in a roughly globular form, they are situated:—this species of very general, rather than absolute, equability, being in full keeping with my deduction of inequidistance, within certain limits, among the originally diffused atoms, as a corollary from the evident design of infinite complexity of relation out of irrelation. I started, it will be remembered, with the idea of a generally uniform but particularly _un_uniform distribution of the atoms;—an idea, I repeat, which an inspection of the stars, as they exist, confirms.  But even in the merely general equability of distribution, as regards the atoms, there appears a difficulty which, no doubt, has already suggested itself to those among my readers who have borne in mind that I suppose this equability of distribution effected through _irradiation from a centre_. The very first glance at the idea, irradiation, forces us to the entertainment of the hitherto unseparated and seemingly inseparable idea of agglomeration about a centre, with dispersion as we recede from it—the idea, in a word, of _in_equability of distribution in respect to the matter irradiated.  Now, I have elsewhere[1] observed that it is by just such difficulties as the one now in question—such roughnesses—such peculiarities—such protuberances above the plane of the ordinary—that Reason feels her way, if at all, in her search for the True. By the difficulty—the “peculiarity”—now presented, I leap at once to _the_ secret—a secret which I might never have attained _but_ for the peculiarity and the inferences which, _in its mere character of peculiarity_, it affords me.      [1] “_Murders in the Rue Morgue_”—p. 133.  The process of thought, at this point, may be thus roughly sketched:—I say to myself—“Unity, as I have explained it, is a truth—I feel it. Diffusion is a truth—I see it. Irradiation, by which alone these two truths are reconciled, is a consequent truth—I perceive it. _Equability_ of diffusion, first deduced _à priori_ and then corroborated by the inspection of phænomena, is also a truth—I fully admit it. So far all is clear around me:—there are no clouds behind which _the_ secret—the great secret of the gravitating _modus operandi_—can possibly lie hidden;—but this secret lies _hereabouts_, most assuredly; and _were_ there but a cloud in view, I should be driven to suspicion of that cloud.” And now, just as I say this, there actually comes a cloud into view. This cloud is the seeming impossibility of reconciling my truth, _irradiation_, with my truth, _equability of diffusion_. I say now:—“Behind this _seeming_ impossibility is to be found what I desire.” I do not say “_real_ impossibility;” for invincible faith in my truths assures me that it is a mere difficulty after all—but I go on to say, with unflinching confidence, that, _when_ this _difficulty_ shall be solved, we shall find, _wrapped up in the process of solution_, the key to the secret at which we aim. Moreover—I _feel_ that we shall discover _but one_ possible solution of the difficulty; this for the reason that, were there two, one would be supererogatory—would be fruitless—would be empty—would contain no key—since no duplicate key can be needed to any secret of Nature.  And now, let us see:—Our usual notions of irradiation—in fact _all_ our distinct notions of it—are caught merely from the process as we see it exemplified in _Light_. Here there is a _continuous_ outpouring of _ray-streams_, and _with a force which we have at least no right to suppose varies at all_. Now, in any such irradiation _as this_—continuous and of unvarying force—the regions nearer the centre must _inevitably_ be always more crowded with the irradiated matter than the regions more remote. But I have assumed _no_ such irradiation _as this_. I assumed no _continuous_ irradiation; and for the simple reason that such an assumption would have involved, first, the necessity of entertaining a conception which I have shown no man _can_ entertain, and which (as I will more fully explain hereafter) all observation of the firmament refutes—the conception of the absolute infinity of the Universe of stars—and would have involved, secondly, the impossibility of understanding a rëaction—that is, gravitation—as existing now—since, while an act is continued, no rëaction, of course, can take place. My assumption, then, or rather my inevitable deduction from just premises—was that of a _determinate_ irradiation—one finally _dis_continued.  Let me now describe the sole possible mode in which it is conceivable that matter could have been diffused through space, so as to fulfil the conditions at once of irradiation and of generally equable distribution.  For convenience of illustration, let us imagine, in the first place, a hollow sphere of glass, or of anything else, occupying the space throughout which the universal matter is to be thus equally diffused, by means of irradiation, from the absolute, irrelative, unconditional particle, placed in the centre of the sphere.  Now, a certain exertion of the diffusive power (presumed to be the Divine Volition)—in other words, a certain _force_—whose measure is the quantity of matter—that is to say, the number of atoms—emitted; emits, by irradiation, this certain number of atoms; forcing them in all directions outwardly from the centre—their proximity to each other diminishing as they proceed—until, finally, they are distributed, loosely, over the interior surface of the sphere.  When these atoms have attained this position, or while proceeding to attain it, a second and inferior exercise of the same force—or a second and inferior force of the same character—emits, in the same manner—that is to say, by irradiation as before—a second stratum of atoms which proceeds to deposit itself upon the first; the number of atoms, in this case as in the former, being of course the measure of the force which emitted them; in other words the force being precisely adapted to the purpose it effects—the force and the number of atoms sent out by the force, being _directly proportional_.  When this second stratum has reached its destined position—or while approaching it—a third still inferior exertion of the force, or a third inferior force of a similar character—the number of atoms emitted being in _all_ cases the measure of the force—proceeds to deposit a third stratum upon the second:—and so on, until these concentric strata, growing gradually less and less, come down at length to the central point; and the diffusive matter, simultaneously with the diffusive force, is exhausted.  We have now the sphere filled, through means of irradiation, with atoms equably diffused. The two necessary conditions—those of irradiation and of equable diffusion—are satisfied; and by the _sole_ process in which the possibility of their simultaneous satisfaction is conceivable. For this reason, I confidently expect to find, lurking in the present condition of the atoms as distributed throughout the sphere, the secret of which I am in search—the all-important principle of the _modus operandi_ of the Newtonian law. Let us examine, then, the actual condition of the atoms.  They lie in a series of concentric strata. They are equably diffused throughout the sphere. They have been irradiated into these states.  The atoms being _equably_ distributed, the greater the superficial extent of any of these concentric strata, or spheres, the more atoms will lie upon it. In other words, the number of atoms lying upon the surface of any one of the concentric spheres, is directly proportional with the extent of that surface.  _But, in any series of concentric spheres, the surfaces are directly proportional with the squares of the distances from the centre._[2]      [2] Succinctly—The surfaces of spheres are as the squares of     their radii.  Therefore the number of atoms in any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that stratum’s distance from the centre.  But the number of atoms in any stratum is the measure of the force which emitted that stratum—that is to say, is _directly proportional_ with the force.  Therefore the force which irradiated any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that stratum’s distance from the centre:—or, generally,  _The force of the irradiation has been directly proportional with the squares of the distances._  Now, Rëaction, as far as we know anything of it, is Action conversed. The _general_ principle of Gravity being, in the first place, understood as the rëaction of an act—as the expression of a desire on the part of Matter, while existing in a state of diffusion, to return into the Unity whence it was diffused; and, in the second place, the mind being called upon to determine the _character_ of the desire—the manner in which it would, naturally, be manifested; in other words, being called upon to conceive a probable law, or _modus operandi_, for the return; could not well help arriving at the conclusion that this law of return would be precisely the converse of the law of departure. That such would be the case, any one, at least, would be abundantly justified in taking for granted, until such time as some person should suggest something like a plausible reason why it should _not_ be the case—until such period as a law of return shall be imagined which the intellect can consider as preferable.  Matter, then, irradiated into space with a force varying as the squares of the distances, might, _à priori_, be supposed to return towards its centre of irradiation with a force varying _inversely_ as the squares of the distances: and I have already shown[3] that any principle which will explain why the atoms should tend, according to any law, to the general centre, must be admitted as satisfactorily explaining, at the same time, why, according to the same law, they should tend each to each. For, in fact, the tendency to the general centre is not to a centre as such, but because of its being a point in tending towards which each atom tends most directly to its real and essential centre, _Unity_—the absolute and final Union of all.      [3] Page 44.  The consideration here involved presents to my own mind no embarrassment whatever—but this fact does not blind me to the possibility of its being obscure to those who may have been less in the habit of dealing with abstractions:—and, upon the whole, it may be as well to look at the matter from one or two other points of view.  The absolute, irrelative particle primarily created by the Volition of God, must have been in a condition of positive _normality_, or rightfulness—for wrongfulness implies _relation_. Right is positive; wrong is negative—is merely the negation of right; as cold is the negation of heat—darkness of light. That a thing may be wrong, it is necessary that there be some other thing in _relation_ to which it _is_ wrong—some condition which it fails to satisfy; some law which it violates; some being whom it aggrieves. If there be no such being, law, or condition, in respect to which the thing is wrong—and, still more especially, if no beings, laws, or conditions exist at all—then the thing can_not_ be wrong and consequently must be _right_. Any deviation from normality involves a tendency to return into it. A difference from the normal—from the right—from the just—can be understood as effected only by the overcoming a difficulty; and if the force which overcomes the difficulty be not infinitely continued, the ineradicable tendency to return will at length be permitted to act for its own satisfaction. Upon withdrawal of the force, the tendency acts. This is the principle of rëaction as the inevitable consequence of finite action. Employing a phraseology of which the seeming affectation will be pardoned for its expressiveness, we may say that Rëaction is the return from the condition of _as it is and ought not to be_ into the condition of _as it was, originally, and therefore ought to be_:—and let me add here that the _absolute_ force of Rëaction would no doubt be always found in direct proportion with the reality—the truth—the absoluteness—of the _originality_—if ever it were possible to measure this latter:—and, consequently, the greatest of all conceivable reactions must be that produced by the tendency which we now discuss—the tendency to return into the _absolutely original_—into the _supremely_ primitive. Gravity, then, _must be the strongest of forces_—an idea reached _à priori_ and abundantly confirmed by induction. What use I make of the idea, will be seen in the sequel.  The atoms, now, having been diffused from their normal condition of Unity, seek to return to——what? Not to any particular _point_, certainly; for it is clear that if, upon the diffusion, the whole Universe of matter had been projected, collectively, to a distance from the point of irradiation, the atomic tendency to the general centre of the sphere would not have been disturbed in the least:—the atoms would not have sought the point _in absolute space_ from which they were originally impelled. It is merely the _condition_, and not the point or locality at which this condition took its rise, that these atoms seek to re-establish;—it is merely _that condition which is their normality_, that they desire. “But they seek a centre,” it will be said, “and a centre is a point.” True; but they seek this point not in its character of point—(for, were the whole sphere moved from its position, they would seek, equally, the centre; and the centre _then_ would be a _new_ point)—but because it so happens, on account of the form in which they collectively exist—(that of the sphere)—that only _through_ the point in question—the sphere’s centre—they can attain their true object, Unity. In the direction of the centre each atom perceives more atoms than in any other direction. Each atom is impelled towards the centre because along the straight line joining it and the centre and passing on to the circumference beyond, there lie a greater number of atoms than along any other straight line—a greater number of objects that seek it, the individual atom—a greater number of tendencies to Unity—a greater number of satisfactions for its own tendency to Unity—in a word, because in the direction of the centre lies the utmost possibility of satisfaction, generally, for its own individual appetite. To be brief, the _condition_, Unity, is all that is really sought; and if the atoms _seem_ to seek the centre of the sphere, it is only impliedly, through implication—because such centre happens to imply, to include, or to involve, the only essential centre, Unity. But _on account of_ this implication or involution, there is no possibility of practically separating the tendency to Unity in the abstract, from the tendency to the concrete centre. Thus the tendency of the atoms to the general centre _is_, to all practical intents and for all logical purposes, the tendency each to each; and the tendency each to each _is_ the tendency to the centre; and the one tendency may be assumed _as_ the other; whatever will apply to the one must be thoroughly applicable to the other; and, in conclusion, whatever principle will satisfactorily explain the one, cannot be questioned as an explanation of the other.  In looking carefully around me for rational objection to what I have advanced, I am able to discover _nothing_;—but of that class of objections usually urged by the doubters for Doubt’s sake, I very readily perceive _three_; and proceed to dispose of them in order.  It may be said, first: “The proof that the force of irradiation (in the case described) is directly proportional to the squares of the distances, depends upon an unwarranted assumption—that of the number of atoms in each stratum being the measure of the force with which they are emitted.”  I reply, not only that I am warranted in such assumption, but that I should be utterly _un_warranted in any other. What I assume is, simply, that an effect is the measure of its cause—that every exercise of the Divine Will will be proportional to that which demands the exertion—that the means of Omnipotence, or of Omniscience, will be exactly adapted to its purposes. Neither can a deficiency nor an excess of cause bring to pass any effect. Had the force which irradiated any stratum to its position, been either more or less than was needed for the purpose—that is to say, not _directly proportional_ to the purpose—then to its position that stratum could not have been irradiated. Had the force which, with a view to general equability of distribution, emitted the proper number of atoms for each stratum, been not _directly proportional_ to the number, then the number would _not_ have been the number demanded for the equable distribution.  The second supposable objection is somewhat better entitled to an answer.  It is an admitted principle in Dynamics that every body, on receiving an impulse, or disposition to move, will move onward in a straight line, in the direction imparted by the impelling force, until deflected, or stopped, by some other force. How then, it may be asked, is my first or external stratum of atoms to be understood as discontinuing their movement at the circumference of the imaginary glass sphere, when no second force, of more than an imaginary character, appears, to account for the discontinuance?  I reply that the objection, in this case, actually does arise out of “an unwarranted assumption”—on the part of the objector—the assumption of a principle, in Dynamics, at an epoch when _no_ “principles,” in _anything_, exist:—I use the word “principle,” of course, in the objector’s understanding of the word.  “In the beginning” we can admit—indeed we can comprehend—but one _First Cause_—the truly ultimate _Principle_—the Volition of God. The primary _act_—that of Irradiation from Unity—must have been independent of all that which the world now calls “principle”—because all that we so designate is but a consequence of the rëaction of that primary act:—I say “_primary_” act; for the creation of the absolute material particle is more properly to be regarded as a _conception_ than as an “_act_” in the ordinary meaning of the term. Thus, we must regard the primary act as an act for the establishment of what we now call “principles.” But this primary act itself is to be considered as _continuous Volition_. The Thought of God is to be understood as originating the Diffusion—as proceeding with it—as regulating it—and, finally, as being withdrawn from it upon its completion. _Then_ commences Rëaction, and through Rëaction, “Principle,” as we employ the word. It will be advisable, however, to limit the application of this word to the two _immediate_ results of the discontinuance of the Divine Volition—that is, to the two agents, _Attraction_ and _Repulsion_. Every other Natural agent depends, either more or less immediately, upon these two, and therefore would be more conveniently designated as _sub_-principle.  It may be objected, thirdly, that, in general, the peculiar mode of distribution which I have suggested for the atoms, is “an hypothesis and nothing more.”  Now, I am aware that the word hypothesis is a ponderous sledge-hammer, grasped immediately, if not lifted, by all very diminutive thinkers, upon the first appearance of any proposition wearing, in any particular, the garb of _a theory_. But “hypothesis” cannot be wielded _here_ to any good purpose, even by those who succeed in lifting it—little men or great.  I maintain, first, that _only_ in the mode described is it conceivable that Matter could have been diffused so as to fulfil at once the conditions of irradiation and of generally equable distribution. I maintain, secondly, that these conditions themselves have been imposed upon me, as necessities, in a train of ratiocination _as rigorously logical as that which establishes any demonstration in Euclid_; and I maintain, thirdly, that even if the charge of “hypothesis” were as fully sustained as it is, in fact, unsustained and untenable, still the validity and indisputability of my result would not, even in the slightest particular, be disturbed.  To explain:—The Newtonian Gravity—a law of Nature—a law whose existence as such no one out of Bedlam questions—a law whose admission as such enables us to account for nine-tenths of the Universal phænomena—a law which, merely because it does so enable us to account for these phænomena, we are perfectly willing, without reference to any other considerations, to admit, and cannot help admitting, as a law—a law, nevertheless, of which neither the principle nor the _modus operandi_ of the principle, has ever yet been traced by the human analysis—a law, in short, which, neither in its detail nor in its generality, has been found susceptible of explanation _at all_—is at length seen to be at every point thoroughly explicable, provided only we yield our assent to——what? To an hypothesis? Why _if_ an hypothesis—if the merest hypothesis—if an hypothesis for whose assumption—as in the case of that _pure_ hypothesis the Newtonian law itself—no shadow of _à priori_ reason could be assigned—if an hypothesis, even so absolute as all this implies, would enable us to perceive a principle for the Newtonian law—would enable us to understand as satisfied, conditions so miraculously—so ineffably complex and seemingly irreconcileable as those involved in the relations of which Gravity tells us,—what rational being _could_ so expose his fatuity as to call even this absolute hypothesis an hypothesis any longer—unless, indeed, he were to persist in so calling it, with the understanding that he did so, simply for the sake of consistency _in words_?  But what is the true state of our present case? What is _the fact_? Not only that it is _not_ an hypothesis which we are required _to adopt_, in order to admit the principle at issue explained, but that it _is_ a logical conclusion which we are requested _not_ to adopt if we can avoid it—which we are simply invited to _deny if we can_:—a conclusion of so accurate a logicality that to dispute it would be the effort—to doubt its validity beyond our power:—a conclusion from which we see no mode of escape, turn as we will; a result which confronts us either at the end of an _in_ductive journey from the phænomena of the very Law discussed, or at the close of a _de_ductive career from the most rigorously simple of all conceivable assumptions—_the assumption, in a word, of Simplicity itself_.  And if here, for the mere sake of cavilling, it be urged, that although my starting-point is, as I assert, the assumption of absolute Simplicity, yet Simplicity, considered merely in itself, is no axiom; and that only deductions from axioms are indisputable—it is thus that I reply:—  Every other science than Logic is the science of certain concrete relations. Arithmetic, for example, is the science of the relations of number—Geometry, of the relations of form—Mathematics in general, of the relations of quantity in general—of whatever can be increased or diminished. Logic, however, is the science of Relation in the abstract—of absolute Relation—of Relation considered solely in itself. An axiom in any particular science other than Logic is, thus, merely a proposition announcing certain concrete relations which seem to be too obvious for dispute—as when we say, for instance, that the whole is greater than its part:—and, thus again, the principle of the _Logical_ axiom—in other words, of an axiom in the abstract—is, simply, _obviousness of relation_. Now, it is clear, not only that what is obvious to one mind may not be obvious to another, but that what is obvious to one mind at one epoch, may be anything but obvious, at another epoch, to the same mind. It is clear, moreover, that what, to-day, is obvious even to the majority of mankind, or to the majority of the best intellects of mankind, may to-morrow be, to either majority, more or less obvious, or in no respect obvious at all. It is seen, then, that the _axiomatic principle_ itself is susceptible of variation, and of course that axioms are susceptible of similar change. Being mutable, the “truths” which grow out of them are necessarily mutable too; or, in other words, are never to be positively depended upon as truths at all—since Truth and Immutability are one.  It will now be readily understood that no axiomatic idea—no idea founded in the fluctuating principle, obviousness of relation—can possibly be so secure—so reliable a basis for any structure erected by the Reason, as _that_ idea—(whatever it is, wherever we can find it, or _if_ it be practicable to find it anywhere)—which is _ir_relative altogether—which not only presents to the understanding _no obviousness_ of relation, either greater or less, to be considered, but subjects the intellect, not in the slightest degree, to the necessity of even looking at _any relation at all_. If such an idea be not what we too heedlessly term “an axiom,” it is at least preferable, as a Logical basis, to any axiom ever propounded, or to all imaginable axioms combined:—and such, precisely, is the idea with which my deductive process, so thoroughly corroborated by induction, commences. My _particle proper_ is but _absolute Irrelation_. To sum up what has been here advanced:—As a starting point I have taken it for granted, simply, that the Beginning had nothing behind it or before it—that it was a Beginning in fact—that it was a beginning and nothing different from a beginning—in short that this Beginning was——_that which it was_. If this be a “mere assumption” then a “mere assumption” let it be.  To conclude this branch of the subject:—I am fully warranted in announcing that _the Law which we have been in the habit of calling Gravity exists on account of Matter’s having been irradiated, at its origin, atomically, into a limited[4] sphere of Space, from one, individual, unconditional, irrelative, and absolute Particle Proper, by the sole process in which it was possible to satisfy, at the same time, the two conditions, irradiation, and generally-equable distribution throughout the sphere—that is to say, by a force varying in direct proportion with the squares of the distances between the irradiated atoms, respectively, and the Particular centre of Irradiation_.      [4] Limited sphere—A sphere is _necessarily_ limited. I prefer     tautology to a chance of misconception.  I have already given my reasons for presuming Matter to have been diffused by a determinate rather than by a continuous or infinitely continued force. Supposing a continuous force, we should be unable, in the first place, to comprehend a rëaction at all; and we should be required, in the second place, to entertain the impossible conception of an infinite extension of Matter. Not to dwell upon the impossibility of the conception, the infinite extension of Matter is an idea which, if not positively disproved, is at least not in any respect warranted by telescopic observation of the stars—a point to be explained more fully hereafter; and this empirical reason for believing in the original finity of Matter is unempirically confirmed. For example:—Admitting, for the moment, the possibility of understanding Space _filled_ with the irradiated atoms—that is to say, admitting, as well as we can, for argument’s sake, that the succession of the irradiated atoms had absolutely _no end_—then it is abundantly clear that, even when the Volition of God had been withdrawn from them, and thus the tendency to return into Unity permitted (abstractly) to be satisfied, this permission would have been nugatory and invalid—practically valueless and of no effect whatever. No Rëaction could have taken place; no movement toward Unity could have been made; no Law of Gravity could have obtained.  To explain:—Grant the _abstract_ tendency of any one atom to any one other as the inevitable result of diffusion from the normal Unity:—or, what is the same thing, admit any given atom as _proposing_ to move in any given direction—it is clear that, since there is an _infinity_ of atoms on all sides of the atom proposing to move, it never can actually move toward the satisfaction of its tendency in the direction given, on account of a precisely equal and counterbalancing tendency in the direction diametrically opposite. In other words, exactly as many tendencies to Unity are behind the hesitating atom as before it; for it is a mere sotticism to say that one infinite line is longer or shorter than another infinite line, or that one infinite number is greater or less than another number that is infinite. Thus the atom in question must remain stationary forever. Under the impossible circumstances which we have been merely endeavoring to conceive for argument’s sake, there could have been no aggregation of Matter—no stars—no worlds—nothing but a perpetually atomic and inconsequential Universe. In fact, view it as we will, the whole idea of unlimited Matter is not only untenable, but impossible and preposterous.  With the understanding of a _sphere_ of atoms, however, we perceive, at once, a _satisfiable_ tendency to union. The general result of the tendency each to each, being a tendency of all to the centre, the _general_ process of condensation, or approximation, commences immediately, by a common and simultaneous movement, on withdrawal of the Divine Volition; the _individual_ approximations, or coalescences—_not_ cöalitions—of atom with atom, being subject to almost infinite variations of time, degree, and condition, on account of the excessive multiplicity of relation, arising from the differences of form assumed as characterizing the atoms at the moment of their quitting the Particle Proper; as well as from the subsequent particular inequidistance, each from each.  What I wish to impress upon the reader is the certainty of there arising, at once, (on withdrawal of the diffusive force, or Divine Volition,) out of the condition of the atoms as described, at innumerable points throughout the Universal sphere, innumerable agglomerations, characterized by innumerable specific differences of form, size, essential nature, and distance each from each. The development of Repulsion (Electricity) must have commenced, of course, with the very earliest particular efforts at Unity, and must have proceeded constantly in the ratio of Coalescence—that is to say, _in that of Condensation_, or, again, of Heterogeneity.  Thus the two Principles Proper, _Attraction_ and _Repulsion_—the Material and the Spiritual—accompany each other, in the strictest fellowship, forever. Thus _The Body and The Soul walk hand in hand_.  If now, in fancy, we select _any one_ of the agglomerations considered as in their primary stages throughout the Universal sphere, and suppose this incipient agglomeration to be taking place at that point where the centre of our Sun exists—or rather where it _did_ exist originally; for the Sun is perpetually shifting his position—we shall find ourselves met, and borne onward for a time at least, by the most magnificent of theories—by the Nebular Cosmogony of Laplace:—although “Cosmogony” is far too comprehensive a term for what he really discusses—which is the constitution of our solar system alone—of one among the myriad of similar systems which make up the Universe Proper—that Universal sphere—that all-inclusive and absolute _Kosmos_ which forms the subject of my present Discourse.  Confining himself to an _obviously limited_ region—that of our solar system with its comparatively immediate vicinity—and _merely_ assuming—that is to say, assuming without any basis whatever, either deductive or inductive—_much_ of what I have been just endeavoring to place upon a more stable basis than assumption; assuming, for example, matter as diffused (without pretending to account for the diffusion) throughout, and somewhat beyond, the space occupied by our system—diffused in a state of heterogeneous nebulosity and obedient to that omniprevalent law of Gravity at whose principle he ventured to make no guess;—assuming all this (which is quite true, although he had no logical right to its assumption) Laplace has shown, dynamically and mathematically, that the results in such case necessarily ensuing, are those and those alone which we find manifested in the actually existing condition of the system itself.  To explain:—Let us conceive _that_ particular agglomeration of which we have just spoken—the one at the point designated by our Sun’s centre—to have so far proceeded that a vast quantity of nebulous matter has here assumed a roughly globular form; its centre being, of course, coincident with what is now, or rather was originally, the centre of our Sun; and its periphery extending out beyond the orbit of Neptune, the most remote of our planets:—in other words, let us suppose the diameter of this rough sphere to be some 6000 millions of miles. For ages, this mass of matter has been undergoing condensation, until at length it has become reduced into the bulk we imagine; having proceeded gradually, of course, from its atomic and imperceptible state, into what we understand of visible, palpable, or otherwise appreciable nebulosity.  Now, the condition of this mass implies a rotation about an imaginary axis—a rotation which, commencing with the absolute incipiency of the aggregation, has been ever since acquiring velocity. The very first two atoms which met, approaching each other from points not diametrically opposite, would, in rushing partially past each other, form a nucleus for the rotary movement described. How this would increase in velocity, is readily seen. The two atoms are joined by others:—an aggregation is formed. The mass continues to rotate while condensing. But any atom at the circumference has, of course, a more rapid motion than one nearer the centre. The outer atom, however, with its superior velocity, approaches the centre; carrying this superior velocity with it as it goes. Thus every atom, proceeding inwardly, and finally attaching itself to the condensed centre, adds something to the original velocity of that centre—that is to say, increases the rotary movement of the mass.  Let us now suppose this mass so far condensed that it occupies _precisely_ the space circumscribed by the orbit of Neptune, and that the velocity with which the surface of the mass moves, in the general rotation, is precisely that velocity with which Neptune now revolves about the Sun. At this epoch, then, we are to understand that the constantly increasing centrifugal force, having gotten the better of the non-increasing centripetal, loosened and separated the exterior and least condensed stratum, or a few of the exterior and least condensed strata, at the equator of the sphere, where the tangential velocity predominated; so that these strata formed about the main body an independent ring encircling the equatorial regions:—just as the exterior portion thrown off, by excessive velocity of rotation, from a grindstone, would form a ring about the grindstone, but for the solidity of the superficial material: were this caoutchouc, or anything similar in consistency, precisely the phænomenon I describe would be presented.  The ring thus whirled from the nebulous mass, _revolved_, of course, _as_ a separate ring, with just that velocity with which, while the surface of the mass, it _rotated_. In the meantime, condensation still proceeding, the interval between the discharged ring and the main body continued to increase, until the former was left at a vast distance from the latter.  Now, admitting the ring to have possessed, by some seemingly accidental arrangement of its heterogeneous materials, a constitution nearly uniform, then this ring, _as_ such, would never have ceased revolving about its primary; but, as might have been anticipated, there appears to have been enough irregularity in the disposition of the materials, to make them cluster about centres of superior solidity; and thus the annular form was destroyed.[5] No doubt, the band was soon broken up into several portions, and one of these portions, predominating in mass, absorbed the others into itself; the whole settling, spherically, into a planet. That this latter, _as_ a planet, continued the revolutionary movement which characterized it while a ring, is sufficiently clear; and that it took upon itself also, an additional movement in its new condition of sphere, is readily explained. The ring being understood as yet unbroken, we see that its exterior, while the whole revolves about the parent body, moves more rapidly than its interior. When the rupture occurred, then, some portion in each fragment must have been moving with greater velocity than the others. The superior movement prevailing, must have whirled each fragment round—that is to say, have caused it to rotate; and the direction of the rotation must, of course, have been the direction of the revolution whence it arose. _All_ the fragments having become subject to the rotation described, must, in coalescing, have imparted it to the one planet constituted by their coalescence.—This planet was Neptune. Its material continuing to undergo condensation, and the centrifugal force generated in its rotation getting, at length, the better of the centripetal, as before in the case of the parent orb, a ring was whirled also from the equatorial surface of this planet: this ring, having been ununiform in its constitution, was broken up, and its several fragments, being absorbed by the most massive, were collectively spherified into a moon. Subsequently, the operation was repeated, and a second moon was the result. We thus account for the planet Neptune, with the two satellites which accompany him.      [5] Laplace assumed his nebulosity heterogeneous, merely that     he might be thus enabled to account for the breaking up of the     rings; for had the nebulosity been homogeneous, they would not     have broken. I reach the same result—heterogeneity of the     secondary masses immediately resulting from the atoms—purely     from an _à priori_ consideration of their general     design—_Relation_.  In throwing off a ring from its equator, the Sun re-established that equilibrium between its centripetal and centrifugal forces which had been disturbed in the process of condensation; but, as this condensation still proceeded, the equilibrium was again immediately disturbed, through the increase of rotation. By the time the mass had so far shrunk that it occupied a spherical space just that circumscribed by the orbit of Uranus, we are to understand that the centrifugal force had so far obtained the ascendency that new relief was needed: a second equatorial band was, consequently, thrown off, which, proving ununiform, was broken up, as before in the case of Neptune; the fragments settling into the planet Uranus; the velocity of whose actual revolution about the Sun indicates, of course, the rotary speed of that Sun’s equatorial surface at the moment of the separation. Uranus, adopting a rotation from the collective rotations of the fragments composing it, as previously explained, now threw off ring after ring; each of which, becoming broken up, settled into a moon:—three moons, at different epochs, having been formed, in this manner, by the rupture and general spherification of as many distinct ununiform rings.  By the time the Sun had shrunk until it occupied a space just that circumscribed by the orbit of Saturn, the balance, we are to suppose, between its centripetal and centrifugal forces had again become so far disturbed, through increase of rotary velocity, the result of condensation, that a third effort at equilibrium became necessary; and an annular band was therefore whirled off as twice before; which, on rupture through ununiformity, became consolidated into the planet Saturn. This latter threw off, in the first place, seven uniform bands, which, on rupture, were spherified respectively into as many moons; but, subsequently, it appears to have discharged, at three distinct but not very distant epochs, three rings whose equability of constitution was, by apparent accident, so considerable as to present no occasion for their rupture; thus they continue to revolve as rings. I use the phrase “_apparent_ accident;” for of accident in the ordinary sense there was, of course, nothing:—the term is properly applied only to the result of indistinguishable or not immediately traceable _law_.  Shrinking still farther, until it occupied just the space circumscribed by the orbit of Jupiter, the Sun now found need of farther effort to restore the counterbalance of its two forces, continually disarranged in the still continued increase of rotation. Jupiter, accordingly, was now thrown off; passing from the annular to the planetary condition; and, on attaining this latter, threw off in its turn, at four different epochs, four rings, which finally resolved themselves into so many moons.  Still shrinking, until its sphere occupied just the space defined by the orbit of the Asteroids, the Sun now discarded a ring which appears to have had _eight_ centres of superior solidity, and, on breaking up, to have separated into eight fragments no one of which so far predominated in mass as to absorb the others. All therefore, as distinct although comparatively small planets, proceeded to revolve in orbits whose distances, each from each, may be considered as in some degree the measure of the force which drove them asunder:—all the orbits, nevertheless, being so closely coincident as to admit of our calling them _one_, in view of the other planetary orbits.  Continuing to shrink, the Sun, on becoming so small as just to fill the orbit of Mars, now discharged this planet—of course by the process repeatedly described. Having no moon, however, Mars could have thrown off no ring. In fact, an epoch had now arrived in the career of the parent body, the centre of the system. The _de_crease of its nebulosity, which is the _in_crease of its density, and which again is the _de_crease of its condensation, out of which latter arose the constant disturbance of equilibrium—must, by this period, have attained a point at which the efforts for restoration would have been more and more ineffectual just in proportion as they were less frequently needed. Thus the processes of which we have been speaking would everywhere show signs of exhaustion—in the planets, first, and secondly, in the original mass. We must not fall into the error of supposing the decrease of interval observed among the planets as we approach the Sun, to be in any respect indicative of an increase of frequency in the periods at which they were discarded. Exactly the converse is to be understood. The longest interval of time must have occurred between the discharges of the two interior; the shortest, between those of the two exterior, planets. The decrease of the interval of space is, nevertheless, the measure of the density, and thus inversely of the condensation, of the Sun, throughout the processes detailed.  Having shrunk, however, so far as to fill only the orbit of our Earth, the parent sphere whirled from itself still one other body—the Earth—in a condition so nebulous as to admit of this body’s discarding, in its turn, yet another, which is our Moon;—but here terminated the lunar formations.  Finally, subsiding to the orbits first of Venus and then of Mercury, the Sun discarded these two interior planets; neither of which has given birth to any moon.  Thus from his original bulk—or, to speak more accurately, from the condition in which we first considered him—from a partially spherified nebular mass, _certainly_ much more than 5,600 millions of miles in diameter—the great central orb and origin of our solar-planetary-lunar system, has gradually descended, by condensation, in obedience to the law of Gravity, to a globe only 882,000 miles in diameter; but it by no means follows, either that its condensation is yet complete, or that it may not still possess the capacity of whirling from itself another planet.  I have here given—in outline of course, but still with all the detail necessary for distinctness—a view of the Nebular Theory as its author himself conceived it. From whatever point we regard it, we shall find it _beautifully true_. It is by far too beautiful, indeed, _not_ to possess Truth as its essentiality—and here I am very profoundly serious in what I say. In the revolution of the satellites of Uranus, there does appear something seemingly inconsistent with the assumptions of Laplace; but that _one_ inconsistency can invalidate a theory constructed from a million of intricate consistencies, is a fancy fit only for the fantastic. In prophecying, confidently, that the apparent anomaly to which I refer, will, sooner or later, be found one of the strongest possible corroborations of the general hypothesis, I pretend to no especial spirit of divination. It is a matter which the only difficulty seems _not_ to foresee.[6]      [6] I am prepared to show that the anomalous revolution of the     satellites of Uranus is a simply perspective anomaly arising     from the inclination of the axis of the planet.  The bodies whirled off in the processes described, would exchange, it has been seen, the superficial _rotation_ of the orbs whence they originated, for a _revolution_ of equal velocity about these orbs as distant centres; and the revolution thus engendered must proceed, so long as the centripetal force, or that with which the discarded body gravitates toward its parent, is neither greater nor less than that by which it was discarded; that is, than the centrifugal, or, far more properly, than the tangential, velocity. From the unity, however, of the origin of these two forces, we might have expected to find them as they are found—the one accurately counterbalancing the other. It has been shown, indeed, that the act of whirling-off is, in every case, merely an act for the preservation of the counterbalance.  After referring, however, the centripetal force to the omniprevalent law of Gravity, it has been the fashion with astronomical treatises, to seek beyond the limits of mere Nature—that is to say, of _Secondary_ Cause—a solution of the phænomenon of tangential velocity. This latter they attribute directly to a _First_ Cause—to God. The force which carries a stellar body around its primary they assert to have originated in an impulse given immediately by the finger—this is the childish phraseology employed—by the finger of Deity itself. In this view, the planets, fully formed, are conceived to have been hurled from the Divine hand, to a position in the vicinity of the suns, with an impetus mathematically adapted to the masses, or attractive capacities, of the suns themselves. An idea so grossly unphilosophical, although so supinely adopted, could have arisen only from the difficulty of otherwise accounting for the absolutely accurate adaptation, each to each, of two forces so seemingly independent, one of the other, as are the gravitating and tangential. But it should be remembered that, for a long time, the coincidence between the moon’s rotation and her sidereal revolution—two matters seemingly far more independent than those now considered—was looked upon as positively miraculous; and there was a strong disposition, even among astronomers, to attribute the marvel to the direct and continual agency of God—who, in this case, it was said, had found it necessary to interpose, specially, among his general laws, a set of subsidiary regulations, for the purpose of forever concealing from mortal eyes the glories, or perhaps the horrors, of the other side of the Moon—of that mysterious hemisphere which has always avoided, and must perpetually avoid, the telescopic scrutiny of mankind. The advance of Science, however, soon demonstrated—what to the philosophical instinct needed _no_ demonstration—that the one movement is but a portion—something more, even, than a consequence—of the other.  For my part, I have no patience with fantasies at once so timorous, so idle, and so awkward. They belong to the veriest _cowardice_ of thought. That Nature and the God of Nature are distinct, no thinking being can long doubt. By the former we imply merely the laws of the latter. But with the very idea of God, omnipotent, omniscient, we entertain, also, the idea of _the infallibility_ of his laws. With Him there being neither Past nor Future—with Him all being _Now_—do we not insult him in supposing his laws so contrived as not to provide for every possible contingency?—or, rather, what idea _can_ we have of _any_ possible contingency, except that it is at once a result and a manifestation of his laws? He who, divesting himself of prejudice, shall have the rare courage to think absolutely for himself, cannot fail to arrive, in the end, at the condensation of _laws_ into _Law_—cannot fail of reaching the conclusion that _each law of Nature is dependent at all points upon all other laws_, and that all are but consequences of one primary exercise of the Divine Volition. Such is the principle of the Cosmogony which, with all necessary deference, I here venture to suggest and to maintain.  In this view, it will be seen that, dismissing as frivolous, and even impious, the fancy of the tangential force having been imparted to the planets immediately by “the finger of God,” I consider this force as originating in the rotation of the stars:—this rotation as brought about by the in-rushing of the primary atoms, towards their respective centres of aggregation:—this in-rushing as the consequence of the law of Gravity:—this law as but the mode in which is necessarily manifested the tendency of the atoms to return into imparticularity:—this tendency to return as but the inevitable rëaction of the first and most sublime of Acts—that act by which a God, self-existing and alone existing, became all things at once, through dint of his volition, while all things were thus constituted a portion of God.  The radical assumptions of this Discourse suggest to me, and in fact imply, certain important _modifications_ of the Nebular Theory as given by Laplace. The efforts of the repulsive power I have considered as made for the purpose of preventing contact among the atoms, and thus as made in the ratio of the approach to contact—that is to say, in the ratio of condensation.[7] In other words, _Electricity_, with its involute phænomena, heat, light and magnetism, is to be understood as proceeding as condensation proceeds, and, of course, inversely as density proceeds, or the _cessation to condense_. Thus the Sun, in the process of its aggregation, must soon, in developing repulsion, have become excessively heated—perhaps incandescent: and we can perceive how the operation of discarding its rings must have been materially assisted by the slight incrustation of its surface consequent on cooling. Any common experiment shows us how readily a crust of the character suggested, is separated, through heterogeneity, from the interior mass. But, on every successive rejection of the crust, the new surface would appear incandescent as before; and the period at which it would again become so far encrusted as to be readily loosened and discharged, may well be imagined as exactly coincident with that at which a new effort would be needed, by the whole mass, to restore the equilibrium of its two forces, disarranged through condensation. In other words:—by the time the electric influence (Repulsion) has prepared the surface for rejection, we are to understand that the gravitating influence (Attraction) is precisely ready to reject it. Here, then, as everywhere, _the Body and the Soul walk hand in hand_.      [7] See page 70.  These ideas are empirically confirmed at all points. Since condensation can never, in any body, be considered as absolutely at an end, we are warranted in anticipating that, whenever we have an opportunity of testing the matter, we shall find indications of resident luminosity in _all_ the stellar bodies—moons and planets as well as suns. That our Moon is strongly self-luminous, we see at her every total eclipse, when, if not so, she would disappear. On the dark part of the satellite, too, during her phases, we often observe flashes like our own Auroras; and that these latter, with our various other so-called electrical phænomena, without reference to any more steady radiance, must give our Earth a certain appearance of luminosity to an inhabitant of the Moon, is quite evident. In fact, we should regard all the phænomena referred to, as mere manifestations, in different moods and degrees, of the Earth’s feebly-continued condensation.  If my views are tenable, we should be prepared to find the newer planets—that is to say, those nearer the Sun—more luminous than those older and more remote:—and the extreme brilliancy of Venus (on whose dark portions, during her phases, the Auroras are frequently visible) does not seem to be altogether accounted for by her mere proximity to the central orb. She is no doubt vividly self-luminous, although less so than Mercury: while the luminosity of Neptune may be comparatively nothing.  Admitting what I have urged, it is clear that, from the moment of the Sun’s discarding a ring, there must be a continuous diminution both of his heat and light, on account of the continuous encrustation of his surface; and that a period would arrive—the period immediately previous to a new discharge—when a _very material_ decrease of both light and heat, must become apparent. Now, we know that tokens of such changes are distinctly recognizable. On the Melville islands—to adduce merely one out of a hundred examples—we find traces of _ultra-tropical_ vegetation—of plants that never could have flourished without immensely more light and heat than are at present afforded by our Sun to any portion of the surface of the Earth. Is such vegetation referable to an epoch immediately subsequent to the whirling-off of Venus? At this epoch must have occurred to us our greatest access of solar influence; and, in fact, this influence must then have attained its maximum:—leaving out of view, of course, the period when the Earth itself was discarded—the period of its mere organization.  Again:—we know that there exist _non-luminous suns_—that is to say, suns whose existence we determine through the movements of others, but whose luminosity is not sufficient to impress us. Are these suns invisible merely on account of the length of time elapsed since their discharge of a planet? And yet again:—may we not—at least in certain cases—account for the sudden appearances of suns where none had been previously suspected, by the hypothesis that, having rolled with encrusted surfaces throughout the few thousand years of our astronomical history, each of these suns, in whirling off a new secondary, has at length been enabled to display the glories of its still incandescent interior?—To the well-ascertained fact of the proportional increase of heat as we descend into the Earth, I need of course, do nothing more than refer:—it comes in the strongest possible corroboration of all that I have said on the topic now at issue.  In speaking, not long ago, of the repulsive or electrical influence, I remarked that “the important phænomena of vitality, consciousness, and thought, whether we observe them generally or in detail, seem to proceed _at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous_.”[8] I mentioned, too, that I would recur to the suggestion:—and this is the proper point at which to do so. Looking at the matter, first, in detail, we perceive that not merely the _manifestation_ of vitality, but its importance, consequence, and elevation of character, keep pace, very closely, with the heterogeneity, or complexity, of the animal structure. Looking at the question, now, in its generality, and referring to the first movements of the atoms towards mass-constitution, we find that heterogeneousness, brought about directly through condensation, is proportional with it forever. We thus reach the proposition that _the importance of the development of the terrestrial vitality proceeds equably with the terrestrial condensation_.      [8] Page 36.  Now this is in precise accordance with what we know of the succession of animals on the Earth. As it has proceeded in its condensation, superior and still superior races have appeared. Is it impossible that the successive geological revolutions which have attended, at least, if not immediately caused, these successive elevations of vitalic character—is it improbable that these revolutions have themselves been produced by the successive planetary discharges from the Sun—in other words, by the successive variations in the solar influence on the Earth? Were this idea tenable, we should not be unwarranted in the fancy that the discharge of yet a new planet, interior to Mercury, may give rise to yet a new modification of the terrestrial surface—a modification from which may spring a race both materially and spiritually superior to Man. These thoughts impress me with all the force of truth—but I throw them out, of course, merely in their obvious character of suggestion.  The Nebular Theory of Laplace has lately received far more confirmation than it needed, at the hands of the philosopher, Compte. These two have thus together shown—_not_, to be sure, that Matter at any period actually existed as described, in a state of nebular diffusion, but that, admitting it so to have existed throughout the space and much beyond the space now occupied by our solar system, _and to have commenced a movement towards a centre_—it must gradually have assumed the various forms and motions which are now seen, in that system, to obtain. A demonstration such as this—a dynamical and mathematical demonstration, as far as demonstration can be—unquestionable and unquestioned—unless, indeed, by that unprofitable and disreputable tribe, the professional questioners—the mere madmen who deny the Newtonian law of Gravity on which the results of the French mathematicians are based—a demonstration, I say, such as this, would to most intellects be conclusive—and I confess that it is so to mine—of the validity of the nebular hypothesis upon which the demonstration depends.  That the demonstration does not _prove_ the hypothesis, according to the common understanding of the word “proof,” I admit, of course. To show that certain existing results—that certain established facts—may be, even mathematically, accounted for by the assumption of a certain hypothesis, is by no means to establish the hypothesis itself. In other words:—to show that, certain data being given, a certain existing result might, or even _must_, have ensued, will fail to prove that this result _did_ ensue, _from the data_, until such time as it shall be also shown that there are, _and can be_, no other data from which the result in question might _equally_ have ensued. But, in the case now discussed, although all must admit the deficiency of what we are in the habit of terming “proof,” still there are many intellects, and those of the loftiest order, to which _no_ proof could bring one iota of additional _conviction_. Without going into details which might impinge upon the Cloud-Land of Metaphysics, I may as well here observe that the force of conviction, in cases such as this, will always, with the right-thinking, be proportional to the amount of _complexity_ intervening between the hypothesis and the result. To be less abstract:—The greatness of the complexity found existing among cosmical conditions, by rendering great in the same proportion the difficulty of accounting for all these conditions _at once_, strengthens, also in the same proportion, our faith in that hypothesis which does, in such manner, satisfactorily account for them:—and as _no_ complexity can well be conceived greater than that of the astronomical conditions, so no conviction can be stronger—to _my_ mind at least—than that with which I am impressed by an hypothesis that not only reconciles these conditions, with mathematical accuracy, and reduces them into a consistent and intelligible whole, but is, at the same time, the _sole_ hypothesis by means of which the human intellect has been ever enabled to account for them _at all_.  A most unfounded opinion has become latterly current in gossiping and even in scientific circles—the opinion that the so-called Nebular Cosmogony has been overthrown. This fancy has arisen from the report of late observations made, among what hitherto have been termed the “nebulæ,” through the large telescope of Cincinnati, and the world-renowned instrument of Lord Rosse. Certain spots in the firmament which presented, even to the most powerful of the old telescopes, the appearance of nebulosity, or haze, had been regarded for a long time as confirming the theory of Laplace. They were looked upon as stars in that very process of condensation which I have been attempting to describe. Thus it was supposed that we “had ocular evidence”—an evidence, by the way, which has always been found very questionable—of the truth of the hypothesis; and, although certain telescopic improvements, every now and then, enabled us to perceive that a spot, here and there, which we had been classing among the nebulæ, was, in fact, but a cluster of stars deriving its nebular character only from its immensity of distance—still it was thought that no doubt could exist as to the actual nebulosity of numerous other masses, the strong-holds of the nebulists, bidding defiance to every effort at segregation. Of these latter the most interesting was the great “nebulæ” in the constellation Orion:—but this, with innumerable other mis-called “nebulæ,” when viewed through the magnificent modern telescopes, has become resolved into a simple collection of stars. Now this fact has been very generally understood as conclusive against the Nebular Hypothesis of Laplace; and, on announcement of the discoveries in question, the most enthusiastic defender and most eloquent popularizer of the theory, Dr. Nichol, went so far as to “admit the necessity of abandoning” an idea which had formed the material of his most praiseworthy book.[9]      [9] “_Views of the Architecture of the Heavens._” A letter,     purporting to be from Dr. Nichol to a friend in America, went     the rounds of our newspapers, about two years ago, I think,     admitting “the necessity” to which I refer. In a subsequent     Lecture, however, Dr. N. appears in some manner to have gotten     the better of the necessity, and does not quite _renounce_ the     theory, although he seems to wish that he could sneer at it as     “a purely hypothetical one.” What else was the Law of Gravity     before the Maskelyne experiments? and who questioned the Law of     Gravity, even then?  Many of my readers will no doubt be inclined to say that the result of these new investigations _has_ at least a strong _tendency_ to overthrow the hypothesis; while some of them, more thoughtful, will suggest that, although the theory is by no means disproved through the segregation of the particular “nebulæ,” alluded to, still a _failure_ to segregate them, with such telescopes, might well have been understood as a triumphant _corroboration_ of the theory:—and this latter class will be surprised, perhaps, to hear me say that even with _them_ I disagree. If the propositions of this Discourse have been comprehended, it will be seen that, in my view, a failure to segregate the “nebulæ” would have tended to the refutation, rather than to the confirmation, of the Nebular Hypothesis.  Let me explain:—The Newtonian Law of Gravity we may, of course, assume as demonstrated. This law, it will be remembered, I have referred to the rëaction of the first Divine Act—to the rëaction of an exercise of the Divine Volition temporarily overcoming a difficulty. This difficulty is that of forcing the normal into the abnormal—of impelling that whose originality, and therefore whose rightful condition, was _One_, to take upon itself the wrongful condition of _Many_. It is only by conceiving this difficulty as _temporarily_ overcome, that we can comprehend a rëaction. There could have been no rëaction had the act been infinitely continued. So long as the act _lasted_, no rëaction, of course, could commence; in other words, no _gravitation_ could take place—for we have considered the one as but the manifestation of the other. But gravitation _has_ taken place; therefore the act of Creation has ceased: and gravitation has long ago taken place; therefore the act of Creation has long ago ceased. We can no more expect, then, to observe _the primary processes_ of Creation; and to these primary processes the condition of nebulosity has already been explained to belong.  Through what we know of the propagation of light, we have direct proof that the more remote of the stars have existed, under the forms in which we now see them, for an inconceivable number of years. So far back _at least_, then, as the period when these stars underwent condensation, must have been the epoch at which the mass-constitutive processes began. That we may conceive these processes, then, as still going on in the case of certain “nebulæ,” while in all other cases we find them thoroughly at an end, we are forced into assumptions for which we have really _no_ basis whatever—we have to thrust in, again, upon the revolting Reason, the blasphemous idea of special interposition—we have to suppose that, in the particular instances of these “nebulæ,” an unerring God found it necessary to introduce certain supplementary regulations—certain improvements of the general law—certain retouchings and emendations, in a word, which had the effect of deferring the completion of these individual stars for centuries of centuries beyond the æra during which all the other stellar bodies had time, not only to be fully constituted, but to grow hoary with an unspeakable old age.  Of course, it will be immediately objected that since the light by which we recognize the nebulæ now, must be merely that which left their surfaces a vast number of years ago, the processes at present observed, or supposed to be observed, are, in fact, _not_ processes now actually going on, but the phantoms of processes completed long in the Past—just as I maintain all these mass-constitutive processes _must_ have been.  To this I reply that neither is the now-observed condition of the condensed stars their actual condition, but a condition completed long in the Past; so that my argument drawn from the _relative_ condition of the stars and the “nebulæ,” is in no manner disturbed. Moreover, those who maintain the existence of nebulæ, do _not_ refer the nebulosity to extreme distance; they declare it a real and not merely a perspective nebulosity. That we may conceive, indeed, a nebular mass as visible at all, we must conceive it as _very near us_ in comparison with the condensed stars brought into view by the modern telescopes. In maintaining the appearances in question, then, to be really nebulous, we maintain their comparative vicinity to our point of view. Thus, their condition, as we see them now, must be referred to an epoch _far less remote_ than that to which we may refer the now-observed condition of at least the majority of the stars.—In a word, should Astronomy ever demonstrate a “nebula,” in the sense at present intended, I should consider the Nebular Cosmogony—_not_, indeed, as corroborated by the demonstration—but as thereby irretrievably overthrown.  By way, however, of rendering unto Cæsar _no more_ than the things that are Cæsar’s, let me here remark that the assumption of the hypothesis which led him to so glorious a result, seems to have been suggested to Laplace in great measure by a misconception—by the very misconception of which we have just been speaking—by the generally prevalent misunderstanding of the character of the nebulæ, so mis-named. These he supposed to be, in reality, what their designation implies. The fact is, this great man had, very properly, an inferior faith in his own merely _perceptive_ powers. In respect, therefore, to the actual existence of nebulæ—an existence so confidently maintained by his telescopic contemporaries—he depended less upon what he saw than upon what he heard.  It will be seen that the only valid objections to his theory, are those made to its hypothesis _as_ such—to what suggested it—not to what it suggests; to its propositions rather than to its results. His most unwarranted assumption was that of giving the atoms a movement towards a centre, in the very face of his evident understanding that these atoms, in unlimited succession, extended throughout the Universal space. I have already shown that, under such circumstances, there could have occurred no movement at all; and Laplace, consequently, assumed one on no more philosophical ground than that something of the kind was necessary for the establishment of what he intended to establish.  His original idea seems to have been a compound of the true Epicurean atoms with the false nebulæ of his contemporaries; and thus his theory presents us with the singular anomaly of absolute truth deduced, as a mathematical result, from a hybrid datum of ancient imagination intertangled with modern inacumen. Laplace’s real strength lay, in fact, in an almost miraculous mathematical instinct:—on this he relied; and in no instance did it fail or deceive him:—in the case of the Nebular Cosmogony, it led him, blindfolded, through a labyrinth of Error, into one of the most luminous and stupendous temples of Truth.  Let us now fancy, for the moment, that the ring first thrown off by the Sun—that is to say, the ring whose breaking-up constituted Neptune—did not, in fact, break up until the throwing-off of the ring out of which Uranus arose; that this latter ring, again, remained perfect until the discharge of that out of which sprang Saturn; that this latter, again, remained entire until the discharge of that from which originated Jupiter—and so on. Let us imagine, in a word, that no dissolution occurred among the rings until the final rejection of that which gave birth to Mercury. We thus paint to the eye of the mind a series of cöexistent concentric circles; and looking as well at _them_ as at the processes by which, according to Laplace’s hypothesis, they were constructed, we perceive at once a very singular analogy with the atomic strata and the process of the original irradiation as I have described it. Is it impossible that, on measuring the _forces_, respectively, by which each successive planetary circle was thrown off—that is to say, on measuring the successive excesses of rotation over gravitation which occasioned the successive discharges—we should find the analogy in question more decidedly confirmed? _Is it improbable that we should discover these forces to have varied—as in the original radiation—proportionally to the squares of the distances?_  Our solar system, consisting, in chief, of one sun, with sixteen planets certainly, and possibly a few more, revolving about it at various distances, and attended by seventeen moons assuredly, but _very_ probably by several others—is now to be considered as _an example_ of the innumerable agglomerations which proceeded to take place throughout the Universal Sphere of atoms on withdrawal of the Divine Volition. I mean to say that our solar system is to be understood as affording a _generic instance_ of these agglomerations, or, more correctly, of the ulterior conditions at which they arrived. If we keep our attention fixed on the idea of _the utmost possible Relation_ as the Omnipotent design, and on the precautions taken to accomplish it through difference of form, among the original atoms, and particular inequidistance, we shall find it impossible to suppose for a moment that even any two of the incipient agglomerations reached precisely the same result in the end. We shall rather be inclined to think that _no two_ stellar bodies in the Universe—whether suns, planets or moons—are particularly, while _all_ are generally, similar. Still less, then, can we imagine any two _assemblages_ of such bodies—any two “systems”—as having more than a general resemblance.[10] Our telescopes, at this point, thoroughly confirm our deductions. Taking our own solar system, then, as merely a loose or general type of all, we have so far proceeded in our subject as to survey the Universe under the aspect of a spherical space, throughout which, dispersed with merely general equability, exist a number of but generally similar _systems_.      [10] It is not _impossible_ that some unlooked-for optical     improvement may disclose to us, among innumerable varieties of     systems, a luminous sun, encircled by luminous and non-luminous     rings, within and without and between which, revolve luminous     and non-luminous planets, attended by moons having moons—and     even these latter again having moons.  Let us now, expanding our conceptions, look upon each of these systems as in itself an atom; which in fact it is, when we consider it as but one of the countless myriads of systems which constitute the Universe. Regarding all, then, as but colossal atoms, each with the same ineradicable tendency to Unity which characterizes the actual atoms of which it consists—we enter at once upon a new order of aggregations. The smaller systems, in the vicinity of a larger one, would, inevitably, be drawn into still closer vicinity. A thousand would assemble here; a million there—perhaps here, again, even a billion—leaving, thus, immeasurable vacancies in space. And if now, it be demanded why, in the case of these systems—of these merely Titanic atoms—I speak, simply, of an “assemblage,” and not, as in the case of the actual atoms, of a more or less consolidated agglomeration:—if it be asked, for instance, why I do not carry what I suggest to its legitimate conclusion, and describe, at once, these assemblages of system-atoms as rushing to consolidation in spheres—as each becoming condensed into one magnificent sun—my reply is that μελλοντα ταυτα—I am but pausing, for a moment, on the awful threshold of _the Future_. For the present, calling these assemblages “clusters,” we see them in the incipient stages of their consolidation. Their _absolute_ consolidation is _to come_.  We have now reached a point from which we behold the Universe as a spherical space, interspersed, _unequably_, with _clusters_. It will be noticed that I here prefer the adverb “unequably” to the phrase “with a merely general equability,” employed before. It is evident, in fact, that the equability of distribution will diminish in the ratio of the agglomerative processes—that is to say, as the things distributed diminish in number. Thus the increase of _in_-equability—an increase which must continue until, sooner or later, an epoch will arrive at which the largest agglomeration will absorb all the others—should be viewed as, simply, a corroborative indication of the _tendency to One_.  And here, at length, it seems proper to inquire whether the ascertained _facts_ of Astronomy confirm the general arrangement which I have thus, deductively, assigned to the Heavens. Thoroughly, they _do_. Telescopic observation, guided by the laws of perspective, enables us to understand that the perceptible Universe exists as _a cluster of clusters, irregularly disposed_.  The “clusters” of which this Universal “_cluster of clusters_” consists, are merely what we have been in the practice of designating “nebulæ”—and, of these “nebulæ,” _one_ is of paramount interest to mankind. I allude to the Galaxy, or Milky Way. This interests us, first and most obviously, on account of its great superiority in apparent size, not only to any one other cluster in the firmament, but to all the other clusters taken together. The largest of these latter occupies a mere point, comparatively, and is distinctly seen only with the aid of a telescope. The Galaxy sweeps throughout the Heaven and is brilliantly visible to the naked eye. But it interests man chiefly, although less immediately, on account of its being his home; the home of the Earth on which he exists; the home of the Sun about which this Earth revolves; the home of that “system” of orbs of which the Sun is the centre and primary—the Earth one of sixteen secondaries, or planets—the Moon one of seventeen tertiaries, or satellites. The Galaxy, let me repeat, is but one of the _clusters_ which I have been describing—but one of the mis-called “nebulæ” revealed to us—by the telescope alone, sometimes—as faint hazy spots in various quarters of the sky. We have no reason to suppose the Milky Way _really_ more extensive than the least of these “nebulæ.” Its vast superiority in size is but an apparent superiority arising from our position in regard to it—that is to say, from our position in its midst. However strange the assertion may at first appear to those unversed in Astronomy, still the astronomer himself has no hesitation in asserting that we are _in the midst_ of that inconceivable host of stars—of suns—of systems—which constitute the Galaxy. Moreover, not only have _we_—not only has _our_ Sun a right to claim the Galaxy as its own especial cluster, but, with slight reservation, it may be said that all the distinctly visible stars of the firmament—all the stars Visible to the naked eye—have equally a right to claim it as _their_ own.  There has been a great deal of misconception in respect to the _shape_ of the Galaxy; which, in nearly all our astronomical treatises, is said to resemble that of a capital Y. The cluster in question has, in reality, a certain general—_very_ general resemblance to the planet Saturn, with its encompassing triple ring. Instead of the solid orb of that planet, however, we must picture to ourselves a lenticular star-island, or collection of stars; our Sun lying excentrically—near the shore of the island—on that side of it which is nearest the constellation of the Cross and farthest from that of Cassiopeia. The surrounding ring, where it approaches our position, has in it a longitudinal _gash_, which does, in fact, cause _the ring, in our vicinity_, to assume, loosely, the appearance of a capital Y.  We must not fall into the error, however, of conceiving the somewhat indefinite girdle as at all _remote_, comparatively speaking, from the also indefinite lenticular cluster which it surrounds; and thus, for mere purpose of explanation, we may speak of our Sun as actually situated at that point of the Y where its three component lines unite; and, conceiving this letter to be of a certain solidity—of a certain thickness, very trivial in comparison with its length—we may even speak of our position as _in the middle_ of this thickness. Fancying ourselves thus placed, we shall no longer find difficulty in accounting for the phænomena presented—which are perspective altogether. When we look upward or downward—that is to say, when we cast our eyes in the direction of the letter’s _thickness_—we look through fewer stars than when we cast them in the direction of its _length_, or _along_ either of the three component lines. Of course, in the former case, the stars appear scattered—in the latter, crowded.—To reverse this explanation:—An inhabitant of the Earth, when looking, as we commonly express ourselves, _at_ the Galaxy, is then beholding it in some of the directions of its length—is looking _along_ the lines of the Y—but when, looking out into the general Heaven, he turns his eyes _from_ the Galaxy, he is then surveying it in the direction of the letter’s thickness; and on this account the stars seem to him scattered; while, in fact, they are as close together, on an average, as in the mass of the cluster. _No_ consideration could be better adapted to convey an idea of this cluster’s stupendous extent.  If, with a telescope of high space-penetrating power, we carefully inspect the firmament, we shall become aware of _a belt of clusters_—of what we have hitherto called “nebulæ”—a _band_, of varying breadth, stretching from horizon to horizon, at right angles to the general course of the Milky Way. This band is the ultimate _cluster of clusters_. This belt is _The Universe_. Our Galaxy is but one, and perhaps one of the most inconsiderable, of the clusters which go to the constitution of this ultimate, Universal _belt_ or _band_. The appearance of this cluster of clusters, to our eyes, _as_ a belt or band, is altogether a perspective phænomenon of the same character as that which causes us to behold our own individual and roughly-spherical cluster, the Galaxy, under guise also of a belt, traversing the Heavens at right angles to the Universal one. The shape of the all-inclusive cluster is, of course _generally_, that of each individual cluster which it includes. Just as the scattered stars which, on looking _from_ the Galaxy, we see in the general sky, are, in fact, but a portion of that Galaxy itself, and as closely intermingled with it as any of the telescopic points in what seems the densest portion of its mass—so are the scattered “nebulæ” which, on casting our eyes _from_ the Universal _belt_, we perceive at all points of the firmament—so, I say, are these scattered “nebulæ” to be understood as only perspectively scattered, and as part and parcel of the one supreme and Universal _sphere_.  No astronomical fallacy is more untenable, and none has been more pertinaciously adhered to, than that of the absolute _illimitation_ of the Universe of Stars. The reasons for limitation, as I have already assigned them, _à priori_, seem to me unanswerable; but, not to speak of these, _observation_ assures us that there is, in numerous directions around us, certainly, if not in all, a positive limit—or, at the very least, affords us no basis whatever for thinking otherwise. Were the succession of stars endless, then the background of the sky would present us an uniform luminosity, like that displayed by the Galaxy—_since there could be absolutely no point, in all that background, at which would not exist a star._ The only mode, therefore, in which, under such a state of affairs, we could comprehend the _voids_ which our telescopes find in innumerable directions, would be by supposing the distance of the invisible background so immense that no ray from it has yet been able to reach us at all. That this _may_ be so, who shall venture to deny? I maintain, simply, that we have not even the shadow of a reason for believing that it _is_ so.  When speaking of the vulgar propensity to regard all bodies on the Earth as tending merely to the Earth’s centre, I observed that, “with certain exceptions to be specified hereafter, every body on the Earth tended not only to the Earth’s centre, but in every conceivable direction besides.”[11] The “exceptions” refer to those frequent gaps in the Heavens, where our utmost scrutiny can detect not only no stellar bodies, but no indications of their existence:—where yawning chasms, blacker than Erebus, seem to afford us glimpses, through the boundary walls of the Universe of Stars, into the illimitable Universe of Vacancy, beyond. Now as any body, existing on the Earth, chances to pass, either through its own movement or the Earth’s, into a line with any one of these voids, or cosmical abysses, it clearly is no longer attracted _in the direction of that void_, and for the moment, consequently, is “heavier” than at any period, either after or before. Independently of the consideration of these voids, however, and looking only at the generally unequable distribution of the stars, we see that the absolute tendency of bodies on the Earth to the Earth’s centre, is in a state of perpetual variation.      [11] Page 62.  We comprehend, then, the insulation of our Universe. We perceive the isolation of _that_—of _all_ that which we grasp with the senses. We know that there exists one _cluster of clusters_—a collection around which, on all sides, extend the immeasurable wildernesses of a Space _to all human perception_ untenanted. But _because_ upon the confines of this Universe of Stars we are compelled to pause, through want of farther evidence from the senses, is it right to conclude that, in fact, there _is_ no material point beyond that which we have thus been permitted to attain? Have we, or have we not, an analogical right to the inference that this perceptible Universe—that this cluster of clusters—is but one of _a series_ of clusters of clusters, the rest of which are invisible through distance—through the diffusion of their light being so excessive, ere it reaches us, as not to produce upon our retinas a light-impression—or from there being no such emanation as light at all, in these unspeakably distant worlds—or, lastly, from the mere interval being so vast, that the electric tidings of their presence in Space, have not yet—through the lapsing myriads of years—been enabled to traverse that interval?  Have we any right to inferences—have we any ground whatever for visions such as these? If we have a right to them in _any_ degree, we have a right to their infinite extension.  The human brain has obviously a leaning to the “_Infinite_,” and fondles the phantom of the idea. It seems to long with a passionate fervor for this impossible conception, with the hope of intellectually believing it when conceived. What is general among the whole race of Man, of course no individual of that race can be warranted in considering abnormal; nevertheless, there _may_ be a class of superior intelligences, to whom the human bias alluded to may wear all the character of monomania.  My question, however, remains unanswered:—Have we any right to infer—let us say, rather, to imagine—an interminable succession of the “clusters of clusters,” or of “Universes” more or less similar?  I reply that the “right,” in a case such as this, depends absolutely upon the hardihood of that imagination which ventures to claim the right. Let me declare, only, that, as an individual, I myself feel impelled to the _fancy_—without daring to call it more—that there _does_ exist a _limitless_ succession of Universes, more or less similar to that of which we have cognizance—to that of which _alone_ we shall ever have cognizance—at the very least until the return of our own particular Universe into Unity. _If_ such clusters of clusters exist, however—_and they do_—it is abundantly clear that, having had no part in our origin, they have no portion in our laws. They neither attract us, nor we them. Their material—their spirit is not ours—is not that which obtains in any part of our Universe. They could not impress our senses or our souls. Among them and us—considering all, for the moment, collectively—there are no influences in common. Each exists, apart and independently, _in the bosom of its proper and particular God_.  In the conduct of this Discourse, I am aiming less at physical than at metaphysical order. The clearness with which even material phænomena are presented to the understanding, depends very little, I have long since learned to perceive, upon a merely natural, and almost altogether upon a moral, arrangement. If then I seem to step somewhat too discursively from point to point of my topic, let me suggest that I do so in the hope of thus the better keeping unbroken that chain of _graduated impression_ by which alone the intellect of Man can expect to encompass the grandeurs of which I speak, and, in their majestic totality, to comprehend them.  So far, our attention has been directed, almost exclusively, to a general and relative grouping of the stellar bodies in space. Of specification there has been little; and whatever ideas of _quantity_ have been conveyed—that is to say, of number, magnitude, and distance—have been conveyed incidentally and by way of preparation for more definitive conceptions. These latter let us now attempt to entertain.  Our solar system, as has been already mentioned, consists, in chief, of one sun and sixteen planets certainly, but in all probability a few others, revolving around it as a centre, and attended by seventeen moons of which we know, with possibly several more of which as yet we know nothing. These various bodies are not true spheres, but oblate spheroids—spheres flattened at the poles of the imaginary axes about which they rotate:—the flattening being a consequence of the rotation. Neither is the Sun absolutely the centre of the system; for this Sun itself, with all the planets, revolves about a perpetually shifting point of space, which is the system’s general centre of gravity. Neither are we to consider the paths through which these different spheroids move—the moons about the planets, the planets about the Sun, or the Sun about the common centre—as circles in an accurate sense. They are, in fact, _ellipses—one of the foci being the point about which the revolution is made_. An ellipse is a curve, returning into itself, one of whose diameters is longer than the other. In the longer diameter are two points, equidistant from the middle of the line, and so situated otherwise that if, from each of them a straight line be drawn to any one point of the curve, the two lines, taken together, will be equal to the longer diameter itself. Now let us conceive such an ellipse. At one of the points mentioned, which are the _foci_, let us fasten an orange. By an elastic thread let us connect this orange with a pea; and let us place this latter on the circumference of the ellipse. Let us now move the pea continuously around the orange—keeping always on the circumference of the ellipse. The elastic thread, which, of course, varies in length as we move the pea, will form what in geometry is called a _radius vector_. Now, if the orange be understood as the Sun, and the pea as a planet revolving about it, then the revolution should be made at such a rate—with a velocity so varying—that the _radius vector_ may pass over _equal areas of space in equal times_. The progress of the pea _should be_—in other words, the progress of the planet _is_, of course,—slow in proportion to its distance from the Sun—swift in proportion to its proximity. Those planets, moreover, move the more slowly which are the farther from the Sun; _the squares of their periods of revolution having the same proportion to each other, as have to each other the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun_.  The wonderfully complex laws of revolution here described, however, are not to be understood as obtaining in our system alone. They _everywhere_ prevail where Attraction prevails. They control _the Universe_. Every shining speck in the firmament is, no doubt, a luminous sun, resembling our own, at least in its general features, and having in attendance upon it a greater or less number of planets, greater or less, whose still lingering luminosity is not sufficient to render them visible to us at so vast a distance, but which, nevertheless, revolve, moon-attended, about their starry centres, in obedience to the principles just detailed—in obedience to the three omniprevalent laws of revolution—the three immortal laws _guessed_ by the imaginative Kepler, and but subsequently demonstrated and accounted for by the patient and mathematical Newton. Among a tribe of philosophers who pride themselves excessively upon matter-of-fact, it is far too fashionable to sneer at all speculation under the comprehensive _sobriquet_, “guess-work.” The point to be considered is, _who_ guesses. In guessing with Plato, we spend our time to better purpose, now and then, than in hearkening to a demonstration by Alcmæon.  In many works on Astronomy I find it distinctly stated that the laws of Kepler are _the basis_ of the great principle, Gravitation. This idea must have arisen from the fact that the suggestion of these laws by Kepler, and his proving them _à posteriori_ to have an actual existence, led Newton to account for them by the hypothesis of Gravitation, and, finally, to demonstrate them _à priori_, as necessary consequences of the hypothetical principle. Thus so far from the laws of Kepler being the basis of Gravity, Gravity is the basis of these laws—as it is, indeed, of all the laws of the material Universe which are not referable to Repulsion alone.  The mean distance of the Earth from the Moon—that is to say, from the heavenly body in our closest vicinity—is 237,000 miles. Mercury, the planet nearest the Sun, is distant from him 37 millions of miles. Venus, the next, revolves at a distance of 68 millions:—the Earth, which comes next, at a distance of 95 millions:—Mars, then, at a distance of 144 millions. Now come the eight Asteroids (Ceres, Juno, Vesta, Pallas, Astræa, Flora, Iris, and Hebe) at an average distance of about 250 millions. Then we have Jupiter, distant 490 millions; then Saturn, 900 millions; then Uranus, 19 hundred millions; finally Neptune, lately discovered, and revolving at a distance, say of 28 hundred millions. Leaving Neptune out of the account—of which as yet we know little accurately and which is, possibly, one of a system of Asteroids—it will be seen that, within certain limits, there exists an _order of interval_ among the planets. Speaking loosely, we may say that each outer planet is twice as far from the Sun as is the next inner one. May not the _order_ here mentioned—_may not the law of Bode—be deduced from consideration of the analogy suggested by me as having place between the solar discharge of rings and the mode of the atomic irradiation_?  The numbers hurriedly mentioned in this summary of distance, it is folly to attempt comprehending, unless in the light of abstract arithmetical facts. They are not practically tangible ones. They convey no precise ideas. I have stated that Neptune, the planet farthest from the Sun, revolves about him at a distance of 28 hundred millions of miles. So far good:—I have stated a mathematical fact; and, without comprehending it in the least, we may put it to use—mathematically. But in mentioning, even, that the Moon revolves about the Earth at the comparatively trifling distance of 237,000 miles, I entertained no expectation of giving any one to understand—to know—to feel—how far from the Earth the Moon actually _is_. 237,000 _miles_! There are, perhaps, few of my readers who have not crossed the Atlantic ocean; yet how many of them have a distinct idea of even the 3,000 miles intervening between shore and shore? I doubt, indeed, whether the man lives who can force into his brain the most remote conception of the interval between one milestone and its next neighbor upon the turnpike. We are in some measure aided, however, in our consideration of distance, by combining this consideration with the kindred one of velocity. Sound passes through 1100 feet of space in a second of time. Now were it possible for an inhabitant of the Earth to see the flash of a cannon discharged in the Moon, and to hear the report, he would have to wait, after perceiving the former, more than 13 entire days and nights before getting any intimation of the latter.  However feeble be the impression, even thus conveyed, of the Moon’s real distance from the Earth, it will, nevertheless, effect a good object in enabling us more clearly to see the futility of attempting to grasp such intervals as that of the 28 hundred millions of miles between our Sun and Neptune; or even that of the 95 millions between the Sun and the Earth we inhabit. A cannon-ball, flying at the greatest velocity with which such a ball has ever been known to fly, could not traverse the latter interval in less than 20 years; while for the former it would require 590.  Our Moon’s real diameter is 2160 miles; yet she is comparatively so trifling an object that it would take nearly 50 such orbs to compose one as great as the Earth.  The diameter of our own globe is 7912 miles—but from the enunciation of these numbers what positive idea do we derive?  If we ascend an ordinary mountain and look around us from its summit, we behold a landscape stretching, say 40 miles, in every direction; forming a circle 250 miles in circumference; and including an area of 5000 square miles. The extent of such a prospect, on account of the _successiveness_ with which its portions necessarily present themselves to view, can be only very feebly and very partially appreciated:—yet the entire panorama would comprehend no more than one 40,000th part of the mere _surface_ of our globe. Were this panorama, then, to be succeeded, after the lapse of an hour, by another of equal extent; this again by a third, after the lapse of another hour; this again by a fourth after lapse of another hour—and so on, until the scenery of the whole Earth were exhausted; and were we to be engaged in examining these various panoramas for twelve hours of every day; we should nevertheless, be 9 years and 48 days in completing the general survey.  But if the mere surface of the Earth eludes the grasp of the imagination, what are we to think of its cubical contents? It embraces a mass of matter equal in weight to at least 2 sextillions, 200 quintillions of tons. Let us suppose it in a state of quiescence; and now let us endeavor to conceive a mechanical force sufficient to set it in motion! Not the strength of all the myriads of beings whom we may conclude to inhabit the planetary worlds of our system—not the combined physical strength of _all_ these beings—even admitting all to be more powerful than man—would avail to stir the ponderous mass _a single inch_ from its position.  What are we to understand, then, of the force, which under similar circumstances, would be required to move the _largest_ of our planets, Jupiter? This is 86,000 miles in diameter, and would include within its periphery more than a thousand orbs of the magnitude of our own. Yet this stupendous body is actually flying around the Sun at the rate of 29,000 miles an hour—that is to say, with a velocity 40 times greater than that of a cannon-ball! The thought of such a phænomenon cannot well be said to _startle_ the mind:—it palsies and appals it. Not unfrequently we task our imagination in picturing the capacities of an angel. Let us fancy such a being at a distance of some hundred miles from Jupiter—a close eye-witness of this planet as it speeds on its annual revolution. Now _can_ we, I demand, fashion for ourselves any conception so distinct of this ideal being’s spiritual exaltation, as _that_ involved in the supposition that, even by this immeasurable mass of matter, whirled immediately before his eyes, with a velocity so unutterable, he—an angel—angelic though he be—is not at once struck into nothingness and overwhelmed?  At this point, however, it seems proper to suggest that, in fact, we have been speaking of comparative trifles. Our Sun, the central and controlling orb of the system to which Jupiter belongs, is not only greater than Jupiter, but greater by far than all the planets of the system taken together. This fact is an essential condition, indeed, of the stability of the system itself. The diameter of Jupiter has been mentioned:—it is 86,000 miles:—that of the Sun is 882,000 miles. An inhabitant of the latter, travelling 90 miles a day, would be more than 80 years in going round a great circle of its circumference. It occupies a cubical space of 681 quadrillions, 472 trillions of miles. The Moon, as has been stated, revolves about the Earth at a distance of 237,000 miles—in an orbit, consequently, of nearly a million and a half. Now, were the Sun placed upon the Earth, centre over centre, the body of the former would extend, in every direction, not only to the line of the Moon’s orbit, but beyond it, a distance of 200,000 miles.  And here, once again, let me suggest that, in fact, we have _still_ been speaking of comparative trifles. The distance of the planet Neptune from the Sun has been stated:—it is 28 hundred millions of miles; the circumference of its orbit, therefore, is about 17 billions. Let this be borne in mind while we glance at some one of the brightest stars. Between this and the star of _our_ system, (the Sun,) there is a gulf of space, to convey any idea of which we should need the tongue of an archangel. From _our_ system, then, and from _our_ Sun, or star, the star at which we suppose ourselves glancing is a thing altogether apart:—still, for the moment, let us imagine it placed upon our Sun, centre over centre, as we just now imagined this Sun itself placed upon the Earth. Let us now conceive the particular star we have in mind, extending, in every direction, beyond the orbit of Mercury—of Venus—of the Earth:—still _on_, beyond the orbit of Mars—of Jupiter—of Uranus—until, finally, we fancy it filling the circle—17 _billions of miles in circumference_—which is described by the revolution of Leverrier’s planet. When we have conceived all this, we shall have entertained no extravagant conception. There is the very best reason for believing that many of the stars are even far larger than the one we have imagined. I mean to say that we have the very best _empirical_ basis for such belief:—and, in looking back at the original, atomic arrangements for _diversity_, which have been assumed as a part of the Divine plan in the constitution of the Universe, we shall be enabled easily to understand, and to credit, the existence of even far vaster disproportions in stellar size than any to which I have hitherto alluded. The largest orbs, of course, we must expect to find rolling through the widest vacancies of Space.  I remarked, just now, that to convey an idea of the interval between our Sun and any one of the other stars, we should require the eloquence of an archangel. In so saying, I should not be accused of exaggeration; for, in simple truth, these are topics on which it is scarcely possible to exaggerate. But let us bring the matter more distinctly before the eye of the mind.  In the first place, we may get a general, _relative_ conception of the interval referred to, by comparing it with the inter-planetary spaces. If, for example, we suppose the Earth, which is, in reality, 95 millions of miles from the Sun, to be only _one foot_ from that luminary; then Neptune would be 40 feet distant; _and the star Alpha Lyræ, at the very least_, 159.  Now I presume that, in the termination of my last sentence, few of my readers have noticed anything especially objectionable—particularly wrong. I said that the distance of the Earth from the Sun being taken at _one foot_, the distance of Neptune would be 40 feet, and that of Alpha Lyræ, 159. The proportion between one foot and 159 has appeared, perhaps, to convey a sufficiently definite impression of the proportion between the two intervals—that of the Earth from the Sun and that of Alpha Lyræ from the same luminary. But my account of the matter should, in reality, have run thus:—The distance of the Earth from the Sun being taken at one foot, the distance of Neptune would be 40 feet, and that of Alpha Lyræ, 159——_miles_:—that is to say, I had assigned to Alpha Lyræ, in my first statement of the case, only the 5280_th_ _part_ of that distance which is the _least distance possible_ at which it can actually lie.  To proceed:—However distant a mere _planet_ is, yet when we look at it through a telescope, we see it under a certain form—of a certain appreciable size. Now I have already hinted at the probable bulk of many of the stars; nevertheless, when we view any one of them, even through the most powerful telescope, it is found to present us with _no form_, and consequently with _no magnitude_ whatever. We see it as a point and nothing more.  Again;—Let us suppose ourselves walking, at night, on a highway. In a field on one side of the road, is a line of tall objects, say trees, the figures of which are distinctly defined against the background of the sky. This line of objects extends at right angles to the road, and from the road to the horizon. Now, as we proceed along the road, we see these objects changing their positions, respectively, in relation to a certain fixed point in that portion of the firmament which forms the background of the view. Let us suppose this fixed point—sufficiently fixed for our purpose—to be the rising moon. We become aware, at once, that while the tree nearest us so far alters its position in respect to the moon, as to seem flying behind us, the tree in the extreme distance has scarcely changed at all its relative position with the satellite. We then go on to perceive that the farther the objects are from us, the less they alter their positions; and the converse. Then we begin, unwittingly, to estimate the distances of individual trees by the degrees in which they evince the relative alteration. Finally, we come to understand how it might be possible to ascertain the actual distance of any given tree in the line, by using the amount of relative alteration as a basis in a simple geometrical problem. Now this relative alteration is what we call “parallax;” and by parallax we calculate the distances of the heavenly bodies. Applying the principle to the trees in question, we should, of course, be very much at a loss to comprehend the distance of _that_ tree, which, however far we proceeded along the road, should evince _no_ parallax at all. This, in the case described, is a thing impossible; but impossible only because all distances on our Earth are trivial indeed:—in comparison with the vast cosmical quantities, we may speak of them as absolutely nothing.  Now, let us suppose the star Alpha Lyræ directly overhead; and let us imagine that, instead of standing on the Earth, we stand at one end of a straight road stretching through Space to a distance equalling the diameter of the Earth’s orbit—that is to say, to a distance of 190 _millions of miles_. Having observed, by means of the most delicate micrometrical instruments, the exact position of the star, let us now pass along this inconceivable road, until we reach its other extremity. Now, once again, let us look at the star. It is _precisely_ where we left it. Our instruments, however delicate, assure us that its relative position is absolutely—is identically the same as at the commencement of our unutterable journey. _No_ parallax—none whatever—has been found.  The fact is, that, in regard to the distance of the fixed stars—of any one of the myriads of suns glistening on the farther side of that awful chasm which separates our system from its brothers in the cluster to which it belongs—astronomical science, until very lately, could speak only with a negative certainty. Assuming the brightest as the nearest, we could say, even of _them_, only that there is a certain incomprehensible distance on the _hither_ side of which they cannot be:—how far they are beyond it we had in no case been able to ascertain. We perceived, for example, that Alpha Lyræ cannot be nearer to us than 19 trillions, 200 billions of miles; but, for all we knew, and indeed for all we now know, it may be distant from us the square, or the cube, or any other power of the number mentioned. By dint, however, of wonderfully minute and cautious observations, continued, with novel instruments, for many laborious years, _Bessel_, not long ago deceased, has lately succeeded in determining the distance of six or seven stars; among others, that of the star numbered 61 in the constellation of the Swan. The distance in this latter instance ascertained, is 670,000 times that of the Sun; which last it will be remembered, is 95 millions of miles. The star 61 Cygni, then, is nearly 64 trillions of miles from us—or more than three times the distance assigned, _as the least possible_, for Alpha Lyræ.  In attempting to appreciate this interval by the aid of any considerations of _velocity_, as we did in endeavoring to estimate the distance of the moon, we must leave out of sight, altogether, such nothings as the speed of a cannon-ball, or of sound. Light, however, according to the latest calculations of Struve, proceeds at the rate of 167,000 miles in a second. Thought itself cannot pass through this interval more speedily—if, indeed, thought can traverse it at all. Yet, in coming from 61 Cygni to us, even at this inconceivable rate, light occupies more than _ten years_; and, consequently, were the star this moment blotted out from the Universe, still, _for ten years_, would it continue to sparkle on, undimmed in its paradoxical glory.  Keeping now in mind whatever feeble conception we may have attained of the interval between our Sun and 61 Cygni, let us remember that this interval, however unutterably vast, we are permitted to consider as but the _average_ interval among the countless host of stars composing that cluster, or “nebula,” to which our system, as well as that of 61 Cygni, belongs. I have, in fact, stated the case with great moderation:—we have excellent reason for believing 61 Cygni to be one of the _nearest_ stars, and thus for concluding, at least for the present, that its distance from us is _less_ than the average distance between star and star in the magnificent cluster of the Milky Way.  And here, once again and finally, it seems proper to suggest that even as yet we have been speaking of trifles. Ceasing to wonder at the space between star and star in our own or in any particular cluster, let us rather turn our thoughts to the intervals between cluster and cluster, in the all comprehensive cluster of the Universe.  I have already said that light proceeds at the rate of 167,000 miles in a second—that is, about 10 millions of miles in a minute, or about 600 millions of miles in an hour:—yet so far removed from us are some of the “nebulæ” that even light, speeding with this velocity, could not and does not reach us, from those mysterious regions, in less than 3 _millions of years_. This calculation, moreover, is made by the elder Herschell, and in reference merely to those comparatively proximate clusters within the scope of his own telescope. There _are_ “nebulæ,” however, which, through the magical tube of Lord Rosse, are this instant whispering in our ears the secrets of _a million of ages_ by-gone. In a word, the events which we behold now—at this moment—in those worlds—are the identical events which interested their inhabitants _ten hundred thousand centuries ago_. In intervals—in distances such as this suggestion forces upon the _soul_—rather than upon the mind—we find, at length, a fitting climax to all hitherto frivolous considerations of _quantity_.  Our fancies thus occupied with the cosmical distances, let us take the opportunity of referring to the difficulty which we have so often experienced, while pursuing _the beaten path_ of astronomical reflection, _in accounting_ for the immeasurable voids alluded to—in comprehending why chasms so totally unoccupied and therefore apparently so needless, have been made to intervene between star and star—between cluster and cluster—in understanding, to be brief, a sufficient reason for the Titanic scale, in respect of mere _Space_, on which the Universe is seen to be constructed. A rational cause for the phænomenon, I maintain that Astronomy has palpably failed to assign:—but the considerations through which, in this Essay, we have proceeded step by step, enable us clearly and immediately to perceive that _Space and Duration are one_. That the Universe might _endure_ throughout an æra at all commensurate with the grandeur of its component material portions and with the high majesty of its spiritual purposes, it was necessary that the original atomic diffusion be made to so inconceivable an extent as to be only not infinite. It was required, in a word, that the stars should be gathered into visibility from invisible nebulosity—proceed from nebulosity to consolidation—and so grow grey in giving birth and death to unspeakably numerous and complex variations of vitalic development:—it was required that the stars should do all this—should have time thoroughly to accomplish all these Divine purposes—_during the period_ in which all things were effecting their return into Unity with a velocity accumulating in the inverse proportion of the squares of the distances at which lay the inevitable End.  Throughout all this we have no difficulty in understanding the absolute accuracy of the Divine _adaptation_. The density of the stars, respectively, proceeds, of course, as their condensation diminishes; condensation and heterogeneity keep pace with each other; through the latter, which is the index of the former, we estimate the vitalic and spiritual development. Thus, in the density of the globes, we have the measure in which their purposes are fulfilled. _As_ density proceeds—_as_ the divine intentions _are_ accomplished—_as_ less and still less remains _to be_ accomplished—so—in the same ratio—should we expect to find an acceleration of _the End_:—and thus the philosophical mind will easily comprehend that the Divine designs in constituting the stars, advance _mathematically_ to their fulfilment:—and more; it will readily give the advance a mathematical expression; it will decide that this advance is inversely proportional with the squares of the distances of all created things from the starting-point and goal of their creation.  Not only is this Divine adaptation, however, mathematically accurate, but there is that about it which stamps it _as divine_, in distinction from that which is merely the work of human constructiveness. I allude to the complete _mutuality_ of adaptation. For example; in human constructions a particular cause has a particular effect; a particular intention brings to pass a particular object; but this is all; we see no reciprocity. The effect does not re-act upon the cause; the intention does not change relations with the object. In Divine constructions the object is either design or object as we choose to regard it—and we may take at any time a cause for an effect, or the converse—so that we can never absolutely decide which is which.  To give an instance:—In polar climates the human frame, to maintain its animal heat, requires, for combustion in the capillary system, an abundant supply of highly azotized food, such as train-oil. But again:—in polar climates nearly the sole food afforded man is the oil of abundant seals and whales. Now, whether is oil at hand because imperatively demanded, or the only thing demanded because the only thing to be obtained? It is impossible to decide. There is an absolute _reciprocity of adaptation_.  The pleasure which we derive from any display of human ingenuity is in the ratio of _the approach_ to this species of reciprocity. In the construction of _plot_, for example, in fictitious literature, we should aim at so arranging the incidents that we shall not be able to determine, of any one of them, whether it depends from any one other or upholds it. In this sense, of course, _perfection_ of _plot_ is really, or practically, unattainable—but only because it is a finite intelligence that constructs. The plots of God are perfect. The Universe is a plot of God.  And now we have reached a point at which the intellect is forced, again, to struggle against its propensity for analogical inference—against its monomaniac grasping at the infinite. Moons have been seen _revolving_ about planets; planets about stars; and the poetical instinct of humanity—its instinct of the symmetrical, if the symmetry be but a symmetry of surface:—this _instinct_, which the Soul, not only of Man but of all created beings, took up, in the beginning, from the _geometrical_ basis of the Universal irradiation—impels us to the fancy of an endless extension of this system of _cycles_. Closing our eyes equally to _de_duction and _in_duction, we insist upon imagining a _revolution_ of all the orbs of the Galaxy about some gigantic globe which we take to be the central pivot of the whole. Each cluster in the great cluster of clusters is imagined, of course, to be similarly supplied and constructed; while, that the “analogy” may be wanting at no point, we go on to conceive these clusters themselves, again, as _revolving_ about some still more august sphere;—this latter, still again, _with_ its encircling clusters, as but one of a yet more magnificent series of agglomerations, _gyrating_ about yet another orb central _to them_—some orb still more unspeakably sublime—some orb, let us rather say, of infinite sublimity endlessly multiplied by the infinitely sublime. Such are the conditions, continued in perpetuity, which the voice of what some people term “analogy” calls upon the Fancy to depict and the Reason to contemplate, if possible, without becoming dissatisfied with the picture. Such, _in general_, are the interminable gyrations beyond gyration which we have been instructed by Philosophy to comprehend and to account for, at least in the best manner we can. Now and then, however, a philosopher proper—one whose phrenzy takes a very determinate turn—whose genius, to speak more reverentially, has a strongly-pronounced washerwomanish bias, doing every thing up by the dozen—enables us to see _precisely_ that point out of sight, at which the revolutionary processes in question do, and of right ought to, come to an end.  It is hardly worth while, perhaps, even to sneer at the reveries of Fourrier:—but much has been said, latterly, of the hypothesis of Mädler—that there exists, in the centre of the Galaxy, a stupendous globe about which all the systems of the cluster revolve. The _period_ of our own, indeed, has been stated—117 millions of years.  That our Sun has a motion in space, independently of its rotation, and revolution about the system’s centre of gravity, has long been suspected. This motion, granting it to exist, would be manifested perspectively. The stars in that firmamental region which we were leaving behind us, would, in a very long series of years, become crowded; those in the opposite quarter, scattered. Now, by means of astronomical History, we ascertain, cloudily, that some such phænomena have occurred. On this ground it has been declared that our system is moving to a point in the heavens diametrically opposite the star Zeta Herculis:—but this inference is, perhaps, the maximum to which we have any logical right. Mädler, however, has gone so far as to designate a particular star, Alcyone in the Pleiades, as being at or about the very spot around which a general _revolution_ is performed.  Now, since by “analogy” we are led, in the first instance, to these dreams, it is no more than proper that we should abide by analogy, at least in some measure, during their development; and that analogy which suggests the revolution, suggests at the same time a central orb about which it should be performed:—so far the astronomer was consistent. This central orb, however, should, dynamically, be greater than all the orbs, taken together, which surround it. Of these there are about 100 millions. “Why, then,” it was of course demanded, “do we not _see_ this vast central sun—_at least equal_ in mass to 100 millions of such suns as ours—why do we not _see_ it—_we_, especially, who occupy the mid region of the cluster—the very locality _near_ which, at all events, must be situated this incomparable star?” The reply was ready—“It must be non-luminous, as are our planets.” Here, then, to suit a purpose, analogy is suddenly let fall. “Not so,” it may be said—“we know that non-luminous suns actually exist.” It is true that we have reason at least for supposing so; but we have certainly no reason whatever for supposing that the non-luminous suns in question are encircled by _luminous_ suns, while these again are surrounded by non-luminous planets:—and it is precisely all this with which Mädler is called upon to find any thing analogous in the heavens—for it is precisely all this which he imagines in the case of the Galaxy. Admitting the thing to be so, we cannot help here picturing to ourselves how sad a puzzle the _why it is so_ must prove to all _à priori_ philosophers.  But granting, in the very teeth of analogy and of every thing else, the non-luminosity of the vast central orb, we may still inquire how this orb, so enormous, could fail of being rendered visible by the flood of light thrown upon it from the 100 millions of glorious suns glaring in all directions about it. Upon the urging of this question, the idea of an actually solid central sun appears, in some measure, to have been abandoned; and speculation proceeded to assert that the systems of the cluster perform their revolutions merely about an immaterial centre of gravity common to all. Here again then, to suit a purpose, analogy is let fall. The planets of our system revolve, it is true, about a common centre of gravity; but they do this in connexion with, and in consequence of, a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the rest of the system.  The mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight lines. But this idea of the circle—an idea which, in view of all ordinary geometry, is merely the mathematical, as contradistinguished from the practical, idea—is, in sober fact, the _practical_ conception which alone we have any right to entertain in regard to the majestic circle with which we have to deal, at least in fancy, when we suppose our system revolving about a point in the centre of the Galaxy. Let the most vigorous of human imaginations attempt but to take a single step towards the comprehension of a sweep so ineffable! It would scarcely be paradoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself, travelling _forever_ upon the circumference of this unutterable circle, would still, _forever_, be travelling in a straight line. That the path of our Sun in such an orbit would, to any human perception, deviate in the slightest degree from a straight line, even in a million of years, is a proposition not to be entertained:—yet we are required to believe that a curvature has become apparent during the brief period of our astronomical history—during a mere point—during the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years.  It may be said that Mädler _has_ really ascertained a curvature in the direction of our system’s now well-established progress through Space. Admitting, if necessary, this fact to be in reality such, I maintain that nothing is thereby shown except the reality of this fact—the fact of a curvature. For its _thorough_ determination, ages will be required; and, when determined, it will be found indicative of some binary or other multiple relation between our Sun and some one or more of the proximate stars. I hazard nothing however, in predicting, that, after the lapse of many centuries, all efforts at determining the path of our Sun through Space, will be abandoned as fruitless. This is easily conceivable when we look at the infinity of perturbation it must experience, from its perpetually-shifting relations with other orbs, in the common approach of all to the nucleus of the Galaxy.  But in examining other “nebulæ” than that of the Milky Way—in surveying, generally, the clusters which overspread the heavens—do we or do we not find confirmation of Mädler’s hypothesis? We do _not_. The forms of the clusters are exceedingly diverse when casually viewed; but on close inspection, through powerful telescopes, we recognize the sphere, very distinctly, as at least the proximate form of all:—their constitution, in general, being at variance with the idea of revolution about a common centre.  “It is difficult,” says Sir John Herschell, “to form any conception of the dynamical state of such systems. On one hand, without a rotary motion and a centrifugal force, it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of _progressive collapse_. On the other, granting such a motion and such a force, we find it no less difficult to reconcile their forms with the rotation of the whole system [meaning cluster] around any single axis, without which internal collision would appear to be inevitable.”  Some remarks lately made about the “nebulæ” by Dr. Nichol, in taking quite a different view of the cosmical conditions from any taken in this Discourse—have a very peculiar applicability to the point now at issue. He says:  “When our greatest telescopes are brought to bear upon them, we find that those which were thought to be irregular, are not so; they approach nearer to a globe. Here is one that looked oval; but Lord Rosse’s telescope brought it into a circle.... Now there occurs a very remarkable circumstance in reference to these comparatively sweeping circular masses of nebulæ. We find they are not entirely circular, but the reverse; and that all around them, on every side, there are volumes of stars, _stretching out apparently as if they were rushing towards a great central mass in consequence of the action of some great power_.”[12]      [12] I must be understood as denying, _especially_, only the     _revolutionary_ portion of Mädler’s hypothesis. Of course, if     no great central orb exists _now_ in our cluster, such will     exist hereafter. Whenever existing, it will be merely the     _nucleus_ of the consolidation.  Were I to describe, in my own words, what must necessarily be the existing condition of each nebula on the hypothesis that all matter is, as I suggest, now returning to its original Unity, I should simply be going over, nearly verbatim, the language here employed by Dr. Nichol, without the faintest suspicion of that stupendous truth which is the key to these nebular phænomena.  And here let me fortify my position still farther, by the voice of a greater than Mädler—of one, moreover, to whom all the data of Mädler have long been familiar things, carefully and thoroughly considered. Referring to the elaborate calculations of Argelander—the very researches which form Mädler’s basis—_Humboldt_, whose generalizing powers have never, perhaps been equalled, has the following observation:  “When we regard the real, proper, or non-perspective motions of the stars, we find _many groups of them moving in opposite directions_; and the data as yet in hand render it not necessary, at least, to conceive that the systems composing the Milky Way, or the clusters, generally, composing the Universe, are revolving about any particular centre unknown, whether luminous or non-luminous. It is but Man’s longing for a fundamental First Cause, that impels both his intellect and his fancy to the adoption of such an hypothesis.”[13]      [13] Betrachtet man die nicht perspectivischen eigenen     Bewegungen der Sterne, so scheinen viele gruppenweise in ihrer     Richtung entgegengesetzt; und die bisher gesammelten Thatsachen     machen es auf’s wenigste nicht nothwendig, anzunehmen, dass     alle Theile unserer Sternenschicht oder gar der gesammten     Sterneninseln, welche den Weltraum füllen, sich um einen     grossen, unbekannten, leuchtenden oder dunkeln Centralkörper     bewegen. Das Streben nach den letzten und höchsten     Grundursachen macht freilich die reflectirende Thätigkeit des     Menschen, wie seine Phantasie, zu einer solchen Annahme     geneigt.  The phænomenon here alluded to—that of “many groups moving in opposite directions”—is quite inexplicable by Mädler’s idea; but arises, as a necessary consequence, from that which forms the basis of this Discourse. While the _merely general direction_ of each atom—of each moon, planet, star, or cluster—would, on my hypothesis, be, of course, absolutely rectilinear; while the _general_ path of all bodies would be a right line leading to the centre of all; it is clear, nevertheless, that this general rectilinearity would be compounded of what, with scarcely any exaggeration, we may term an infinity of particular curves—an infinity of local deviations from rectilinearity—the result of continuous differences of relative position among the multitudinous masses, as each proceeded on its own proper journey to the End.  I quoted, just now, from Sir John Herschell, the following words, used in reference to the clusters:—“On one hand, without a rotary motion and a centrifugal force, it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of _progressive collapse_.” The fact is, that, in surveying the “nebulæ” with a telescope of high power, we shall find it quite impossible, having once conceived this idea of “collapse,” not to gather, at all points, corroboration of the idea. A nucleus is always apparent, in the direction of which the stars seem to be precipitating themselves; nor can these nuclei be mistaken for merely perspective phænomena:—the clusters are _really_ denser near the centre—sparser in the regions more remote from it. In a word, we see every thing as we _should_ see it were a collapse taking place; but, in general, it may be said of these clusters, that we can fairly entertain, while looking at them, the idea of _orbitual movement about a centre_, only by admitting the _possible_ existence, in the distant domains of space, of dynamical laws with which _we_ are unacquainted.  On the part of Herschell, however, there is evidently _a reluctance_ to regard the nebulæ as in “a state of progressive collapse.” But if facts—if even appearances justify the supposition of their being in this state, _why_, it may well be demanded, is he disinclined to admit it? Simply on account of a prejudice;—merely because the supposition is at war with a preconceived and utterly baseless notion—that of the endlessness—that of the eternal stability of the Universe.  If the propositions of this Discourse are tenable, the “state of progressive collapse” is _precisely_ that state in which alone we are warranted in considering All Things; and, with due humility, let me here confess that, for my part, I am at a loss to conceive how any _other_ understanding of the existing condition of affairs, could ever have made its way into the human brain. “The tendency to collapse” and “the attraction of gravitation” are convertible phrases. In using either, we speak of the rëaction of the First Act. Never was necessity less obvious than that of supposing Matter imbued with an ineradicable _quality_ forming part of its material nature—a quality, or instinct, _forever_ inseparable from it, and by dint of which inalienable principle every atom is _perpetually_ impelled to seek its fellow-atom. Never was necessity less obvious than that of entertaining this unphilosophical idea. Going boldly behind the vulgar thought, we have to conceive, metaphysically, that the gravitating principle appertains to Matter _temporarily_—only while diffused—only while existing as Many instead of as One—appertains to it by virtue of its state of irradiation alone—appertains, in a word, altogether to its _condition_, and not in the slightest degree to _itself_. In this view, when the irradiation shall have returned into its source—when the rëaction shall be completed—the gravitating principle will no longer exist. And, in fact, astronomers, without at any time reaching the idea here suggested, seem to have been approximating it, in the assertion that “if there were but one body in the Universe, it would be impossible to understand how the principle, Gravity, could obtain:”—that is to say, from a consideration of Matter as they find it, they reach a conclusion at which I deductively arrive. That so pregnant a suggestion as the one just quoted should have been permitted to remain so long unfruitful, is, nevertheless, a mystery which I find it difficult to fathom.  It is, perhaps, in no little degree, however, our propensity for the continuous—for the analogical—in the present case more particularly for the symmetrical—which has been leading us astray. And, in fact, the sense of the symmetrical is an instinct which may be depended upon with an almost blindfold reliance. It is the poetical essence of the Universe—_of the Universe_ which, in the supremeness of its symmetry, is but the most sublime of poems. Now symmetry and consistency are convertible terms:—thus Poetry and Truth are one. A thing is consistent in the ratio of its truth—true in the ratio of its consistency. _A perfect consistency, I repeat, can be nothing but an absolute truth._ We may take it for granted, then, that Man cannot long or widely err, if he suffer himself to be guided by his poetical, which I have maintained to be his truthful, in being his symmetrical, instinct. He must have a care, however, lest, in pursuing too heedlessly the superficial symmetry of forms and motions, he leave out of sight the really essential symmetry of the principles which determine and control them.  That the stellar bodies would finally be merged in one—that, at last, all would be drawn into the substance of _one stupendous central orb already existing_—is an idea which, for some time past, seems, vaguely and indeterminately, to have held possession of the fancy of mankind. It is an idea, in fact, which belongs to the class of the _excessively obvious_. It springs, instantly, from a superficial observation of the cyclic and seemingly _gyrating_, or _vorticial_ movements of those individual portions of the Universe which come most immediately and most closely under our observation. There is not, perhaps, a human being, of ordinary education and of average reflective capacity, to whom, at some period, the fancy in question has not occurred, as if spontaneously, or intuitively, and wearing all the character of a very profound and very original conception. This conception, however, so commonly entertained, has never, within my knowledge, arisen out of any abstract considerations. Being, on the contrary, always suggested, as I say, by the vorticial movements about centres, a reason for it, also,—a _cause_ for the ingathering of all the orbs into one, _imagined to be already existing_, was naturally sought in the same direction—among these cyclic movements themselves.  Thus it happened that, on announcement of the gradual and perfectly regular decrease observed in the orbit of Enck’s comet, at every successive revolution about our Sun, astronomers were nearly unanimous in the opinion that the cause in question was found—that a principle was discovered sufficient to account, physically, for that final, universal agglomeration which, I repeat, the analogical, symmetrical or poetical instinct of Man had predetermined to understand as something more than a simple hypothesis.  This cause—this sufficient reason for the final ingathering—was declared to exist in an exceedingly rare but still material medium pervading space; which medium, by retarding, in some degree, the progress of the comet, perpetually weakened its tangential force; thus giving a predominance to the centripetal; which, of course, drew the comet nearer and nearer at each revolution, and would eventually precipitate it upon the Sun.  All this was strictly logical—admitting the medium or ether; but this ether was assumed, most illogically, on the ground that no _other_ mode than the one spoken of could be discovered, of accounting for the observed decrease in the orbit of the comet:—as if from the fact that we could _discover_ no other mode of accounting for it, it followed, in any respect, that no other mode of accounting for it existed. It is clear that innumerable causes might operate, in combination, to diminish the orbit, without even a possibility of our ever becoming acquainted with one of them. In the meantime, it has never been fairly shown, perhaps, why the retardation occasioned by the skirts of the Sun’s atmosphere, through which the comet passes at perihelion, is not enough to account for the phænomenon. That Enck’s comet will be absorbed into the Sun, is probable; that all the comets of the system will be absorbed, is more than merely possible; but, in such case, the principle of absorption must be referred to eccentricity of orbit—to the close approximation to the Sun, of the comets at their perihelia; and is a principle not affecting, in any degree, the ponderous _spheres_, which are to be regarded as the true material constituents of the Universe.—Touching comets, in general, let me here suggest, in passing, that we cannot be far wrong in looking upon them as the _lightning-flashes of the cosmical Heaven_.  The idea of a retarding ether and, through it, of a final agglomeration of all things, seemed at one time, however, to be confirmed by the observation of a positive decrease in the orbit of the solid moon. By reference to eclipses recorded 2500 years ago, it was found that the velocity of the satellite’s revolution _then_ was considerably less than it is _now_; that on the hypothesis that its motions in its orbit is uniformly in accordance with Kepler’s law, and was accurately determined _then_—2500 years ago—it is now in advance of the position it _should_ occupy, by nearly 9000 miles. The increase of velocity proved, of course, a diminution of orbit; and astronomers were fast yielding to a belief in an ether, as the sole mode of accounting for the phænomenon, when Lagrange came to the rescue. He showed that, owing to the configurations of the spheroids, the shorter axes of their ellipses are subject to variation in length; the longer axes being permanent; and that this variation is continuous and vibratory—so that every orbit is in a state of transition, either from circle to ellipse, or from ellipse to circle. In the case of the moon, where the shorter axis is _de_creasing, the orbit is passing from circle to ellipse and, consequently, is _de_creasing too; but, after a long series of ages, the ultimate eccentricity will be attained; then the shorter axis will proceed to _in_crease, until the orbit becomes a circle; when the process of shortening will again take place;—and so on forever. In the case of the Earth, the orbit is passing from ellipse to circle. The facts thus demonstrated do away, of course, with all necessity for supposing an ether, and with all apprehension of the system’s instability—on the ether’s account.  It will be remembered that I have myself assumed what we may term _an ether_. I have spoken of a subtle _influence_ which we know to be ever in attendance upon matter, although becoming manifest only through matter’s heterogeneity. To this _influence_—without daring to touch it at all in any effort at explaining its awful _nature_—I have referred the various phænomena of electricity, heat, light, magnetism; and more—of vitality, consciousness, and thought—in a word, of spirituality. It will be seen, at once, then, that the ether thus conceived is radically distinct from the ether of the astronomers; inasmuch as theirs is _matter_ and mine _not_.  With the idea of a material ether, seems, thus, to have departed altogether the thought of that universal agglomeration so long predetermined by the poetical fancy of mankind:—an agglomeration in which a sound Philosophy might have been warranted in putting faith, at least to a certain extent, if for no other reason than that by this poetical fancy it _had_ been so predetermined. But so far as Astronomy—so far as mere Physics have yet spoken, the cycles of the Universe are perpetual—the Universe has no conceivable end. Had an end been demonstrated, however, from so purely collateral a cause as an ether, Man’s instinct of the Divine _capacity to adapt_, would have rebelled against the demonstration. We should have been forced to regard the Universe with some such sense of dissatisfaction as we experience in contemplating an unnecessarily complex work of human art. Creation would have affected us as an imperfect _plot_ in a romance, where the _dénoûment_ is awkwardly brought about by interposed incidents external and foreign to the main subject; instead of springing out of the bosom of the thesis—out of the heart of the ruling idea—instead of arising as a result of the primary proposition—as inseparable and inevitable part and parcel of the fundamental conception of the book.  What I mean by the symmetry of mere surface will now be more clearly understood. It is simply by the blandishment of this symmetry that we have been beguiled into the general idea of which Mädler’s hypothesis is but a part—the idea of the vorticial indrawing of the orbs. Dismissing this nakedly physical conception, the symmetry of principle sees the end of all things metaphysically involved in the thought of a beginning; seeks and finds in this origin of all things the _rudiment_ of this end; and perceives the impiety of supposing this end likely to be brought about less simply—less directly—less obviously—less artistically—than through _the rëaction of the originating Act_.  Recurring, then, to a previous suggestion, let us understand the systems—let us understand each star, with its attendant planets—as but a Titanic atom existing in space with precisely the same inclination for Unity which characterized, in the beginning, the actual atoms after their irradiation throughout the Universal sphere. As these original atoms rushed towards each other in generally straight lines, so let us conceive as at least generally rectilinear, the paths of the system-atoms towards their respective centres of aggregation:—and in this direct drawing together of the systems into clusters, with a similar and simultaneous drawing together of the clusters themselves while undergoing consolidation, we have at length attained the great _Now_—the awful Present—the Existing Condition of the Universe.  Of the still more awful Future a not irrational analogy may guide us in framing an hypothesis. The equilibrium between the centripetal and centrifugal forces of each system, being necessarily destroyed upon attainment of a certain proximity to the nucleus of the cluster to which it belongs, there must occur, at once, a chaotic or seemingly chaotic precipitation, of the moons upon the planets, of the planets upon the suns, and of the suns upon the nuclei; and the general result of this precipitation must be the gathering of the myriad now-existing stars of the firmament into an almost infinitely less number of almost infinitely superior spheres. In being immeasurably fewer, the worlds of that day will be immeasurably greater than our own. Then, indeed, amid unfathomable abysses, will be glaring unimaginable suns. But all this will be merely a climacic magnificence foreboding the great End. Of this End the new genesis described, can be but a very partial postponement. While undergoing consolidation, the clusters themselves, with a speed prodigiously accumulative, have been rushing towards their own general centre—and now, with a thousand-fold electric velocity, commensurate only with their material grandeur and with the spiritual passion of their appetite for oneness, the majestic remnants of the tribe of Stars flash, at length, into a common embrace. The inevitable catastrophe is at hand.  But this catastrophe—what is it? We have seen accomplished the ingathering of the orbs. Henceforward, are we not to understand _one material globe of globes_ as constituting and comprehending the Universe? Such a fancy would be altogether at war with every assumption and consideration of this Discourse.  I have already alluded to that absolute _reciprocity of adaptation_ which is the idiosyncrasy of the divine Art—stamping it divine. Up to this point of our reflections, we have been regarding the electrical influence as a something by dint of whose repulsion alone Matter is enabled to exist in that state of diffusion demanded for the fulfilment of its purposes:—so far, in a word, we have been considering the influence in question as ordained for Matter’s sake—to subserve the objects of matter. With a perfectly legitimate reciprocity, we are now permitted to look at Matter, as created _solely for the sake of this influence_—solely to serve the objects of this spiritual Ether. Through the aid—by the means—through the agency of Matter, and by dint of its heterogeneity—is this Ether manifested—is _Spirit individualized_. It is merely in the development of this Ether, through heterogeneity, that particular masses of Matter become animate—sensitive—and in the ratio of their heterogeneity;—some reaching a degree of sensitiveness involving what we call _Thought_ and thus attaining Conscious Intelligence.  In this view, we are enabled to perceive Matter as a Means—not as an End. Its purposes are thus seen to have been comprehended in its diffusion; and with the return into Unity these purposes cease. The absolutely consolidated globe of globes would be _objectless_:—therefore not for a moment could it continue to exist. Matter, created for an end, would unquestionably, on fulfilment of that end, be Matter no longer. Let us endeavor to understand that it would disappear, and that God would remain all in all.  That every work of Divine conception must cöexist and cöexpire with its particular design, seems to me especially obvious; and I make no doubt that, on perceiving the final globe of globes to be _objectless_, the majority of my readers will be satisfied with my “_therefore_ it cannot continue to exist.” Nevertheless, as the startling thought of its instantaneous disappearance is one which the most powerful intellect cannot be expected readily to entertain on grounds so decidedly abstract, let us endeavor to look at the idea from some other and more ordinary point of view:—let us see how thoroughly and beautifully it is corroborated in an _à posteriori_ consideration of Matter as we actually find it.  I have before said that “Attraction and Repulsion being undeniably the sole properties by which Matter is manifested to Mind, we are justified in assuming that Matter _exists_ only as Attraction and Repulsion—in other words that Attraction and Repulsion _are_ Matter; there being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term Matter and the terms ‘Attraction’ and ‘Repulsion’ taken together, as equivalent, and therefore convertible, expressions in Logic.”[14]      [14] Page 37.  Now the very definition of Attraction implies particularity—the existence of parts, particles, or atoms; for we define it as the tendency of “each atom &c. to every other atom” &c. according to a certain law. Of course where there are _no_ parts—where there is absolute Unity—where the tendency to oneness is satisfied—there can be no Attraction:—this has been fully shown, and all Philosophy admits it. When, on fulfilment of its purposes, then, Matter shall have returned into its original condition of _One_—a condition which presupposes the expulsion of the separative ether, whose province and whose capacity are limited to keeping the atoms apart until that great day when, this ether being no longer needed, the overwhelming pressure of the finally collective Attraction shall at length just sufficiently predominate[15] and expel it:—when, I say, Matter, finally, expelling the Ether, shall have returned into absolute Unity,—it will then (to speak paradoxically for the moment) be Matter without Attraction and without Repulsion—in other words, Matter without Matter—in other words, again, _Matter no more_. In sinking into Unity, it will sink at once into that Nothingness which, to all Finite Perception, Unity must be—into that Material Nihility from which alone we can conceive it to have been evoked—to have been _created_ by the Volition of God.      [15] “Gravity, therefore, must be the strongest of forces.”—See     page 39.  I repeat then—Let us endeavor to comprehend that the final globe of globes will instantaneously disappear, and that God will remain all in all.  But are we here to pause? Not so. On the Universal agglomeration and dissolution, we can readily conceive that a new and perhaps totally different series of conditions may ensue—another creation and irradiation, returning into itself—another action and rëaction of the Divine Will. Guiding our imaginations by that omniprevalent law of laws, the law of periodicity, are we not, indeed, more than justified in entertaining a belief—let us say, rather, in indulging a hope—that the processes we have here ventured to contemplate will be renewed forever, and forever, and forever; a novel Universe swelling into existence, and then subsiding into nothingness, at every throb of the Heart Divine?  And now—this Heart Divine—what is it? _It is our own._  Let not the merely seeming irreverence of this idea frighten our souls from that cool exercise of consciousness—from that deep tranquillity of self-inspection—through which alone we can hope to attain the presence of this, the most sublime of truths, and look it leisurely in the face.  The _phænomena_ on which our conclusions must at this point depend, are merely spiritual shadows, but not the less thoroughly substantial.  We walk about, amid the destinies of our world-existence, encompassed by dim but ever present _Memories_ of a Destiny more vast—very distant in the by-gone time, and infinitely awful.  We live out a Youth peculiarly haunted by such dreams; yet never mistaking them for dreams. As Memories we _know_ them. _During our Youth_ the distinction is too clear to deceive us even for a moment.  So long as this Youth endures, the feeling _that we exist_, is the most natural of all feelings. We understand it _thoroughly_. That there was a period at which we did _not_ exist—or, that it might so have happened that we never had existed at all—are the considerations, indeed, which _during this youth_, we find difficulty in understanding. Why we should _not_ exist, is, _up to the epoch of our Manhood_, of all queries the most unanswerable. Existence—self-existence—existence from all Time and to all Eternity—seems, up to the epoch of Manhood, a normal and unquestionable condition:—_seems, because it is_.  But now comes the period at which a conventional World-Reason awakens us from the truth of our dream. Doubt, Surprise and Incomprehensibility arrive at the same moment. They say:—“You live and the time was when you lived not. You have been created. An Intelligence exists greater than your own; and it is only through this Intelligence you live at all.” These things we struggle to comprehend and cannot:—_cannot_, because these things, being untrue, are thus, of necessity, incomprehensible.  No thinking being lives who, at some luminous point of his life of thought, has not felt himself lost amid the surges of futile efforts at understanding, or believing, that anything exists _greater than his own soul_. The utter impossibility of any one’s soul feeling itself inferior to another; the intense, overwhelming dissatisfaction and rebellion at the thought;—these, with the omniprevalent aspirations at perfection, are but the spiritual, coincident with the material, struggles towards the original Unity—are, to my mind at least, a species of proof far surpassing what Man terms demonstration, that no one soul _is_ inferior to another—that nothing is, or can be, superior to any one soul—that each soul is, in part, its own God—its own Creator:—in a word, that God—the material _and_ spiritual God—_now_ exists solely in the diffused Matter and Spirit of the Universe; and that the regathering of this diffused Matter and Spirit will be but the re-constitution of the _purely_ Spiritual and Individual God.  In this view, and in this view alone, we comprehend the riddles of Divine Injustice—of Inexorable Fate. In this view alone the existence of Evil becomes intelligible; but in this view it becomes more—it becomes endurable. Our souls no longer rebel at a _Sorrow_ which we ourselves have imposed upon ourselves, in furtherance of our own purposes—with a view—if even with a futile view—to the extension of our own _Joy_.  I have spoken of _Memories_ that haunt us during our youth. They sometimes pursue us even in our Manhood:—assume gradually less and less indefinite shapes:—now and then speak to us with low voices, saying:  “There was an epoch in the Night of Time, when a still-existent Being existed—one of an absolutely infinite number of similar Beings that people the absolutely infinite domains of the absolutely infinite space.[16] It was not and is not in the power of this Being—any more than it is in your own—to extend, by actual increase, the joy of his Existence; but just as it _is_ in your power to expand or to concentrate your pleasures (the absolute amount of happiness remaining always the same) so did and does a similar capability appertain to this Divine Being, who thus passes his Eternity in perpetual variation of Concentrated Self and almost Infinite Self-Diffusion. What you call The Universe is but his present expansive existence. He now feels his life through an infinity of imperfect pleasures—the partial and pain-intertangled pleasures of those inconceivably numerous things which you designate as his creatures, but which are really but infinite individualizations of Himself. All these creatures—_all_—those which you term animate, as well as those to whom you deny life for no better reason than that you do not behold it in operation—_all_ these creatures have, in a greater or less degree, a capacity for pleasure and for pain:—_but the general sum of their sensations is precisely that amount of Happiness which appertains by right to the Divine Being when concentrated within Himself_. These creatures are all, too, more or less conscious Intelligences; conscious, first, of a proper identity; conscious, secondly and by faint indeterminate glimpses, of an identity with the Divine Being of whom we speak—of an identity with God. Of the two classes of consciousness, fancy that the former will grow weaker, the latter stronger, during the long succession of ages which must elapse before these myriads of individual Intelligences become blended—when the bright stars become blended—into One. Think that the sense of individual identity will be gradually merged in the general consciousness—that Man, for example, ceasing imperceptibly to feel himself Man, will at length attain that awfully triumphant epoch when he shall recognize his existence as that of Jehovah. In the meantime bear in mind that all is Life—Life—Life within Life—the less within the greater, and all within the _Spirit Divine_.”      [16] See pages 102-103—Paragraph commencing “I reply that the     right,” and ending “proper and particular God.”  THE END.     155 Broadway, NEW YORK. 142 Strand, LONDON.  Of late firm of WILEY & PUTNAM.   New Works in Press,  Or recently published, by  GEORGE P. PUTNAM,  155 Broadway, New York.   G. P. PUTNAM has the pleasure of announcing that, agreeably to his contract with the distinguished author, he has now in the course of publication  _A new, uniform, and complete edition_  OF THE  Works of Washington Irving,  Revised and enlarged by the Author,  _In Twelve Elegant Duodecimo Volumes_,  Beautifully printed with new type, and on superior paper, made expressly for the purpose.   The first volume of the Series will be  The Sketch-Book,  complete in one volume,  which will be ready on the first day of September.   Knickerbocker’s History of New York,  with revisions and copious additions,  will be published on the 1st of October.   The Life and Voyages of Columbus,  Vol. I. on the 1st of November,  and the succeeding volumes will be issued on the first day of each month until completed;—as follows:    _The Sketch-Book, in one volume.   Knickerbocker’s New York, in one volume.   Tales of a Traveller, in one volume.   Bracebridge Hall, in one volume.   The Conquest of Grenada, in one volume.   The Alhambra, in one volume.   The Spanish Legends, in one vol.   The Crayon Miscellany, in one vol.—Abbotsford, Newstead,     The Prairies, &c.   Life and Voyages of Columbus, and The Companions of Columbus, 2 vols.   Adventures of Captain Bonneville, one vol.   Astoria, one volume._   The Illustrated Sketch-Book.  In October will be published,  The Sketch-Book.  BY WASHINGTON IRVING.  One volume, square octavo.  Illustrated with a series of highly-finished Engravings on wood, from Designs by Darley and others, engraved in the best style by Childs, Herrick, &c. This edition will be printed on paper of the finest quality, similar in size and style to the new edition of “Halleck’s Poems.” It is intended that the illustrations shall be superior to any engravings on wood yet produced in this country, and that the mechanical execution of the volume, altogether, shall be worthy of the author’s reputation. It will form an elegant and appropriate gift-book for all seasons.   The Illustrated Knickerbocker,  With a series of Original Designs, in one vol., octavo, is also in preparation.   Mr. Putnam has also the honor to announce that he will publish at intervals (in connexion, and uniform with the other collected writings),  _Mr. Irving’s New Works_,  now nearly ready for the press: including  The Life of Mohammed; The Life of Washington; new volumes of Miscellanies, Biographies, &c.      ⁂ This being the first uniform and complete edition of Mr.     Irving’s works, either in this country or in Europe, the     publisher confidently believes that the undertaking will meet     with a prompt and cordial response. To say this, is perhaps     superfluous and impertinent; for it is a truism that no     _American_ book-case (not to say _library_) can be well filled     without the works of Washington Irving; while the English     language itself comprises no purer models of composition.   G. P. Putnam has also made arrangements for the early commencement of new works or new editions of the works of    _Miss C. M. Sedgwick,   Prof. A. Gray,   Leigh Hunt,   Chas. Fenno Hoffman,   Mrs. E. Oakes Smith,   Thomas Carlyle,   George H. Calvert,   Mrs. C. M. Kirkland,   R. Monckton Milnes,   J. Bayard Taylor,   Mary Howitt,   Mrs. Jameson,   S. Wells Williams,   W. M. Thackeray,   Charles Lamb,   A. J. Downing,   Thos. Hood,   Elliot Warburton_.   The following new works are now ready, or will be published this season:  I.  Sophisms of the Protective Policy.  Translated from the French of F. Bastiat. With an introduction by Francis Lieber, LL.D. Professor in South Carolina College, Editor of the Encyclopedia Americana, &c. 12mo. 75 cents.      “It is a book not for the million but for millions, and we     believe if a copy could be put into the hands of every     school-boy in the Union, the next generation would be     inconceivably wiser, richer, and happier than the     present.”—_Mirror._  II.  Grecian and Roman Mythology:  With original illustrations. Adapted for the use of Universities and High Schools, and for popular reading. By M. A. Dwight. With an introduction by Tayler Lewis, Professor of Greek, University of New York. 12mo. (On 1st September.)  Also a fine edition in octavo, with illustrations.      ⁂ This work has been prepared with great care, illustrated with     20 effective outline drawings, and is designed to treat the     subject in an original, comprehensive, and unexceptionable     manner, so as to fill the place as a text book which is yet     unsupplied; while it will also be an attractive and readable     table book for general use. It will be at once introduced as a     text book in the University of New York and other colleges and     schools.  III.  Eureka: a Prose Poem.  Or the Physical and Metaphysical Universe.  By Edgar A. Poe, Esq. Handsomely printed, 12mo. Cloth, 75 cents.      “A most extraordinary Essay. We shall be greatly surprised if     this work does not create a most profound sensation among the     literary and scientific classes.”—_New York Express._  IV.  Oriental Life Illustrated.  Being a new edition of Eöthen, or Traces of Travel in the East. With fine illustrations on Steel. 12mo. elegantly bound, $1 50.      ⁂ This new and unique volume, superbly illuminated by Mapleson,     and comprising original articles by distinguished writers, will     be the most elegant and recherché book of the kind ever     produced in this country. It will be ready in October.  A new and superior edition of the PEARLS OF AMERICAN POETRY will also be published this season.  V.  The Book of Dainty Devices.  In an elegant small folio volume.  Lays of the Western World.  VI.  Dr. Klipstein’s Anglo-Saxon Course of Study.  In uniform 12mo. volumes.  I.  A Grammar of the Anglo-Saxon Language. By Louis F. Klipstein, AA.LL.M. and PH.D., of the University of Giessen.      ⁂ This work recommends itself particularly to the attention of     every American student who “glories in his Anglo-Saxon descent”     or Teutonic lineage, as well as of all who desire an     acquaintance with a language which lies as the foundation of     the English, and throws a light upon its elements and     structure, derivable from no other source. Of the importance     and interesting nature of the study there can be no doubt, and     we agree with those who think that the time is coming when it     will be considered “utterly disgraceful for any well-bred     Englishman or American” to have neglected it. With regard to     the merits of Dr. Klipstein’s Grammar, we will only say, that     it has been already adopted as a text-book in some of the     leading Institutions of our country.  [The following are also in press.]  II.  Analecta Anglo-Saxonica, with an Introductory Ethnographical Essay, Copious Notes, Critical and Explanatory, and a Glossary in which are shown the Indo-Germanic and other Affinities of the Language. _By the same._  In this work appear the fruits of considerable research, and, we may add, learning. The Ethnology of Europe is succinctly, but clearly illustrated, the Anglo-Saxon language completely analysed, revealing the utmost harmony of combination from its elements, its forms and roots compared with those in kindred dialects and cognate tongues, its position in the Teutonic family and Indo-Germanic range established, and the genuine relation of the English to its great parent properly set forth. To those who are fond of the comparative study of language, the Glossary will prove an invaluable aid, apart from its particular object.  III.  Natale Sancti Gregorii Papæ.—Ælfric’s Homily on the Birth-day of St. Gregory, and Collateral Extracts from King Alfred’s version of Bede’s Ecclesiastical History and the Saxon Chronicle, with a full rendering into English, Notes Critical and Explanatory, and an Index of Words. _By the same._  IV.  Extracts from the Anglo-Saxon-Gospels, a Portion of the Anglo-Saxon Paraphrase of the Book of Psalms, and other Selections of a Sacred Order in the same Language, with a Translation into English, and Notes Critical and Explanatory. _By the same._  These two works are prepared in such a way as in themselves, with the aid of the Grammar, to afford every facility to the Anglo-Saxon Student. Ælfric’s Homily is remarkable for beauty of composition, and interesting as setting forth Augustine’s Mission to the “Land of the Angles.”  V.  Tha Halgan Godspel on Englisc—the Anglo-Saxon Version of the Holy Gospels. Edited by Benjamin Thorpe, F.S.A. _Reprinted by the same. Now ready._  This, the earliest “English” version of the Four Gospels, will be found interesting to the antiquarian and theologian, as well as serviceable to the student in his investigations of the language. The Text, besides the usual but unbroken division, appears, with the Rubrics, as read in the early Anglican Church.   _Nearly Ready._  Dr. Bosworth’s Compendious Anglo-Saxon Dictionary. Small 8vo.  VII.  Study of Modern Languages.  Part First; French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and English.  By L. F. Klipstein, AA.LL.M. and Ph.D. One Vol. Imperial 8vo. 75 cents paper; $1 00 cloth.  This work, which is intended equally for the simultaneous and the separate study of the languages that it sets forth, and which is adapted as well for the native of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, or Portugal, as for him to whom English is vernacular, in the acquirement of any one of the other tongues besides his own, will be found an acceptable manual not only to the tyro, but to the more advanced scholar. The reading portion of the matter is interesting, and the text in every case remarkably correct, while the Elementary Phrases, forms of Cards, Letters, Bills of Exchange, Promissory Notes, Receipts, &c., in the six languages, constitute what has long been a desideratum from the American press. For the comparative study of the _Romanic_ tongues the work affords unusual facilities.  VIII.  Pedestrian Tour in Europe.  Views a-Foot; or Europe seen with Knapsack and Staff.  By J. Bayard Taylor.  A new edition with an additional chapter, and a sketch of the author in pedestrian costume, from a drawing by T. Buchanan Read. 12mo. Cloth.  IX.  A New Edition of  Clarke’s Shakspeare Concordance.  A Complete Concordance to Shakspeare: being a Verbal Index to ALL the PASSAGES in the Dramatic Works of the Poet. By Mrs. Cowden Clarke.  “Order gave each thing view.”  One large Vol. comprising 2560 closely printed columns,—(indicating _every word and passage_ in Shakspeare’s Works). Price $6. Cloth.      “The result of sixteen years of untiring labor. The different     editions of Shakspeare have been carefully collated by the     compiler, and every possible means taken to insure the     correctness of the work. As it now stands, a person can find a     particular passage in Shakspeare by simply remembering one word     of it, and is also referred to the act and scene of the play in     which it occurs. As a mere dictionary of Shakspearian language     and phrases, it is of great value; but it is also a dictionary     of his thoughts and imaginations. It altogether supersedes the     volumes of Twiss and Ayscough, and should be on every student’s     shelves”—_Boston Courier._      ⁂ This extraordinary work is printed in London and the price     there _at present_ is £2. 5s. 0d. or about $12. A large part of     the edition having been purchased for this market, it is     furnished here for the very low price of $6, bound in cloth.  _Also—By same Author._  The Book of Shakspeare Proverbs.  18mo. 75 cts.   _Dr. Lieber’s Poetical Address to the American Republic._  16mo. 25 cents.  The West:  A Metrical Epistle.  BY FRANCIS LIEBER.      ⁂ Dr. Lieber, the distinguished Professor of Political Economy     in South Carolina College, Author of “Political Ethics,” &c.,     has just sailed for his native country—Germany—with the view of     aiding in the great cause of Constitutional and Rational     Freedom. This little volume proves that he has well studied     that subject during his long residence in this his adopted     country—and his able and valuable opinions on American Society     and Progress, carry with them a peculiar interest at this time.

We use the word in a good sense, as meaning that there     is no journal among us which seems more laudably desirous to     take the lead in literary and theological science. Its handsome     type and paper give it a pleasing exterior; its typographical     errors, though sufficiently numerous, are so comparatively few,     as to show that it has the advantage of the best American     proof-reading; while for thoroughness of execution in the     departments of history and criticism, it aims to be     pre-eminent.”—_N. Y. Churchman._  Burton.—The Anatomy of Melancholy. By Burton.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.   Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.   Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

preface   to the few who love me and whom i loveto those who feel rather than to those who thinkto the dreamers and those who put faith in dreams as in the only realitiesi offer this book of truths not in its character of truthteller but for the beauty that abounds in its truth constituting it true to these i present the composition as an artproduct alonelet us say as a romance or if i be not urging too lofty a claim as a poem  what i here propound is truetherefore it cannot dieor if by any means it be now trodden down so that it die it will rise again to the life everlasting  nevertheless it is as a poem only that i wish this work to be judged after i am dead  e a p     eureka  an essay on the material and spiritual universe   it is with humility really unassumedit is with a sentiment even of awethat i pen the opening sentence of this work for of all conceivable subjects i approach the reader with the most solemnthe most comprehensivethe most difficultthe most august  what terms shall i find sufficiently simple in their sublimitysufficiently sublime in their simplicityfor the mere enunciation of my theme  i design to speak of the physical metaphysical and mathematicalof the material and spiritual universeof its essence its origin its creation its present condition and its destiny i shall be so rash moreover as to challenge the conclusions and thus in effect to question the sagacity of many of the greatest and most justly reverenced of men  in the beginning let me as distinctly as possible announcenot the theorem which i hope to demonstratefor whatever the mathematicians may assert there is in this world at least no such thing as demonstrationbut the ruling idea which throughout this volume i shall be continually endeavoring to suggest  my general proposition then is thisin the original unity of the first thing lies the secondary cause of all things with the germ of their inevitable annihilation  in illustration of this idea i propose to take such a survey of the universe that the mind may be able really to receive and to perceive an individual impression  he who from the top of ætna casts his eyes leisurely around is affected chiefly by the extent and diversity of the scene only by a rapid whirling on his heel could he hope to comprehend the panorama in the sublimity of its oneness but as on the summit of ætna no man has thought of whirling on his heel so no man has ever taken into his brain the full uniqueness of the prospect and so again whatever considerations lie involved in this uniqueness have as yet no practical existence for mankind  i do not know a treatise in which a survey of the universeusing the word in its most comprehensive and only legitimate acceptationis taken at alland it may be as well here to mention that by the term universe wherever employed without qualification in this essay i mean to designate the utmost conceivable expanse of space with all things spiritual and material that can be imagined to exist within the compass of that expanse in speaking of what is ordinarily implied by the expression universe i shall take a phrase of limitationthe universe of stars why this distinction is considered necessary will be seen in the sequel  but even of treatises on the really limited although always assumed as the unlimited universe of stars i know none in which a survey even of this limited universe is so taken as to warrant deductions from its individuality the nearest approach to such a work is made in the cosmos of alexander von humboldt he presents the subject however not in its individuality but in its generality his theme in its last result is the law of each portion of the merely physical universe as this law is related to the laws of every other portion of this merely physical universe his design is simply synœretical in a word he discusses the universality of material relation and discloses to the eye of philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden behind this universality but however admirable be the succinctness with which he has treated each particular point of his topic the mere multiplicity of these points occasions necessarily an amount of detail and thus an involution of idea which precludes all individuality of impression  it seems to me that in aiming at this latter effect and through it at the consequencesthe conclusionsthe suggestionsthe speculationsor if nothing better offer itself the mere guesses which may result from itwe require something like a mental gyration on the heel we need so rapid a revolution of all things about the central point of sight that while the minutiæ vanish altogether even the more conspicuous objects become blended into one among the vanishing minutiæ in a survey of this kind would be all exclusively terrestrial matters the earth would be considered in its planetary relations alone a man in this view becomes mankind mankind a member of the cosmical family of intelligences  and now before proceeding to our subject proper let me beg the readers attention to an extract or two from a somewhat remarkable letter which appears to have been found corked in a bottle and floating on the mare tenebraruman ocean well described by the nubian geographer ptolemy hephestion but little frequented in modern days unless by the transcendentalists and some other divers for crotchets the date of this letter i confess surprises me even more particularly than its contents for it seems to have been written in the year two thousand eight hundred and fortyeight as for the passages i am about to transcribe they i fancy will speak for themselves  do you know my dear friend says the writer addressing no doubt a contemporarydo you know that it is scarcely more than eight or nine hundred years ago since the metaphysicians first consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there exist but two practicable roads to truth believe it if you can it appears however that long long ago in the night of time there lived a turkish philosopher called aries and surnamed tottle here possibly the letterwriter means aristotle the best names are wretchedly corrupted in two or three thousand years the fame of this great man depended mainly upon his demonstration that sneezing is a natural provision by means of which overprofound thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous ideas through the nose but he obtained a scarcely less valuable celebrity as the founder or at all events as the principal propagator of what was termed the deductive or à priori philosophy he started with what he maintained to be axioms or selfevident truthsand the now well understood fact that no truths are selfevident really does not make in the slightest degree against his speculationsit was sufficient for his purpose that the truths in question were evident at all from axioms he proceeded logically to results his most illustrious disciples were one tuclid a geometrician meaning euclid and one kant a dutchman the originator of that species of transcendentalism which with the change merely of a c for a k now bears his peculiar name  well aries tottle flourished supreme until the advent of one hog surnamed the ettrick shepherd who preached an entirely different system which he called the à posteriori or inductive his plan referred altogether to sensation he proceeded by observing analyzing and classifying factsinstantiæ naturæ as they were somewhat affectedly calledand arranging them into general laws in a word while the mode of aries rested on noumena that of hog depended on phenomena and so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that at its first introduction aries fell into general disrepute finally however he recovered ground and was permitted to divide the empire of philosophy with his more modern rivalthe savans contenting themselves with proscribing all other competitors past present and to come putting an end to all controversy on the topic by the promulgation of a median law to the effect that the aristotelian and baconian roads are and of right ought to be the solo possible avenues to knowledgebaconian you must know my dear friend adds the letterwriter at this point was an adjective invented as equivalent to hogian and at the same time more dignified and euphonious  now i do assure you most positivelyproceeds the epistlethat i represent these matters fairly and you can easily understand how restrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated in those days to retard the progress of true science which makes its most important advancesas all history will showby seemingly intuitive leaps these ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling and i need not suggest to you that crawling among varieties of locomotion is a very capital thing of its kindbut because the tortoise is sure of foot for this reason must we clip the wings of the eagles for many centuries so great was the infatuation about hog especially that a virtual stop was put to all thinking properly so called no man dared utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone it mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably such for the dogmatizing philosophers of that epoch regarded only the road by which it professed to have been attained the end with them was a point of no moment whateverthe means they vociferatedlet us look at the meansand if on scrutiny of the means it was found to come neither under the category hog nor under the category aries which means ram why then the savans went no farther but calling the thinker a fool and branding him a theorist would never thenceforward have any thing to do either with him or with his truths  now my dear friend continues the letterwriter it cannot be maintained that by the crawling system exclusively adopted men would arrive at the maximum amount of truth even in any long series of ages for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced even by absolute certainty in the snail processes but their certainty was very far from absolute the error of our progenitors was quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies he must necessarily see an object the more distinctly the more closely he holds it to his eyes they blinded themselves too with the impalpable titillating scotch snuff of detail and thus the boasted facts of the hogites were by no means always factsa point of little importance but for the assumption that they always were the vital taint however in baconianismits most lamentable fount of errorlay in its tendency to throw power and consideration into the hands of merely perceptive menof those intertritonic minnows the microscopical savansthe diggers and pedlers of minute facts for the most part in physical sciencefacts all of which they retailed at the same price upon the highway their value depending it was supposed simply upon the fact of their fact without reference to their applicability or inapplicability in the development of those ultimate and only legitimate facts called law  than the personsthe letter goes on to saythan the persons thus suddenly elevated by the hogian philosophy into a station for which they were unfittedthus transferred from the sculleries into the parlors of sciencefrom its pantries into its pulpitsthan these individuals a more intoleranta more intolerable set of bigots and tyrants never existed on the face of the earth their creed their text and their sermon were alike the one word factbut for the most part even of this one word they knew not even the meaning on those who ventured to disturb their facts with the view of putting them in order and to use the disciples of hog had no mercy whatever all attempts at generalization were met at once by the words theoretical theory theoristall thought to be brief was very properly resented as a personal affront to themselves cultivating the natural sciences to the exclusion of metaphysics the mathematics and logic many of these baconengendered philosophersoneidead onesided and lame of a legwere more wretchedly helplessmore miserably ignorant in view of all the comprehensible objects of knowledge than the veriest unlettered hind who proves that he knows something at least in admitting that he knows absolutely nothing  nor had our forefathers any better right to talk about certainty when pursuing in blind confidence the à priori path of axioms or of the ram at innumerable points this path was scarcely as straight as a ramshorn the simple truth is that the aristotelians erected their castles upon a basis far less reliable than air for no such things as axioms ever existed or can possibly exist at all this they must have been very blind indeed not to see or at least to suspect for even in their own day many of their longadmitted axioms had been abandonedex nihilo nihil fit for example and a thing cannot act where it is not and there cannot be antipodes and darkness cannot proceed from light these and numerous similar propositions formerly accepted without hesitation as axioms or undeniable truths were even at the period of which i speak seen to be altogether untenablehow absurd in these people then to persist in relying upon a basis as immutable whose mutability had become so repeatedly manifest  but even through evidence afforded by themselves against themselves it is easy to convict these à priori reasoners of the grossest unreasonit is easy to show the futilitythe impalpability of their axioms in general i have now lying before meit will be observed that we still proceed with the letteri have now lying before me a book printed about a thousand years ago pundit assures me that it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic which is logic the author who was much esteemed in his day was one miller or mill and we find it recorded of him as a point of some importance that he rode a millhorse whom he called jeremy benthambut let us glance at the volume itself  ahability or inability to conceive says mr mill very properly is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth now that this is a palpable truism no one in his senses will deny not to admit the proposition is to insinuate a charge of variability in truth itself whose very title is a synonym of the steadfast if ability to conceive be taken as a criterion of truth then a truth to david hume would very seldom be a truth to joe and ninetynine hundredths of what is undeniable in heaven would be demonstrable falsity upon earth the proposition of mr mill then is sustained i will not grant it to be an axiom and this merely because i am showing that no axioms exist but with a distinction which could not have been cavilled at even by mr mill himself i am ready to grant that if an axiom there be then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be considered an axiomthat no more absolute axiom isand consequently that any subsequent proposition which shall conflict with this one primarily advanced must be either a falsity in itselfthat is to say no axiomor if admitted axiomatic must at once neutralize both itself and its predecessor  and now by the logic of their own propounder let us proceed to test any one of the axioms propounded let us give mr mill the fairest of play we will bring the point to no ordinary issue we will select for investigation no commonplace axiomno axiom of what not the less preposterously because only impliedly he terms his secondary classas if a positive truth by definition could be either more or less positively a truthwe will select i say no axiom of an unquestionability so questionable as is to be found in euclid we will not talk for example about such propositions as that two straight lines cannot enclose a space or that the whole is greater than any one of its parts we will afford the logician every advantage we will come at once to a proposition which he regards as the acme of the unquestionableas the quintessence of axiomatic undeniability here it iscontradictions cannot both be truethat is cannot cöexist in nature here mr mill means for instanceand i give the most forcible instance conceivablethat a tree must be either a tree or not a treethat it cannot be at the same time a tree and not a treeall which is quite reasonable of itself and will answer remarkably well as an axiom until we bring it into collation with an axiom insisted upon a few pages beforein other wordswords which i have previously employeduntil we test it by the logic of its own propounder a tree mr mill asserts must be either a tree or not a tree very welland now let me ask him why to this little query there is but one responsei defy any man living to invent a second the sole answer is thisbecause we find it impossible to conceive that a tree can be any thing else than a tree or not a tree this i repeat is mr mills sole answerhe will not pretend to suggest anotherand yet by his own showing his answer is clearly no answer at all for has he not already required us to admit as an axiom that ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truth thus allabsolutely all his argumentation is at sea without a rudder let it not be urged that an exception from the general rule is to be made in cases where the impossibility to conceive is so peculiarly great as when we are called upon to conceive a tree both a tree and not a tree let no attempt i say be made at urging this sotticism for in the first place there are no degrees of impossibility and thus no one impossible conception can be more peculiarly impossible than another impossible conceptionin the second place mr mill himself no doubt after thorough deliberation has most distinctly and most rationally excluded all opportunity for exception by the emphasis of his proposition that in no case is ability or inability to conceive to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truthin the third place even were exceptions admissible at all it remains to be shown how any exception is admissible here that a tree can be both a tree and not a tree is an idea which the angels or the devils may entertain and which no doubt many an earthly bedlamite or transcendentalist does  now i do not quarrel with these ancients continues the letterwriter so much on account of the transparent frivolity of their logicwhich to be plain was baseless worthless and fantastic altogetheras on account of their pompous and infatuate proscription of all other roads to truth than the two narrow and crooked pathsthe one of creeping and the other of crawlingto which in their ignorant perversity they have dared to confine the soulthe soul which loves nothing so well as to soar in those regions of illimitable intuition which are utterly incognizant of path  by the bye my dear friend is it not an evidence of the mental slavery entailed upon those bigoted people by their hogs and rams that in spite of the eternal prating of their savans about roads to truth none of them fell even by accident into what we now so distinctly perceive to be the broadest the straightest and most available of all mere roadsthe great thoroughfarethe majestic highway of the consistent is it not wonderful that they should have failed to deduce from the works of god the vitally momentous consideration that a perfect consistency can be nothing but an absolute truth how plainhow rapid our progress since the late announcement of this proposition by its means investigation has been taken out of the hands of the groundmoles and given as a duty rather than as a task to the trueto the only true thinkersto the generallyeducated men of ardent imagination these latterour keplersour laplacesspeculatetheorizethese are the termscan you not fancy the shout of scorn with which they would be received by our progenitors were it possible for them to be looking over my shoulders as i

unencumbered consistencya consistency which the most stolid admitbecause it is a consistencyto be an absolute and an unquestionable truth  i have often thought my friend that it must have puzzled these dogmaticians of a thousand years ago to determine even by which of their two boasted roads it is that the cryptographist attains the solution of the more complicate cyphersor by which of them champollion guided mankind to those important and innumerable truths which for so many centuries have lain entombed amid the phonetical hieroglyphics of egypt in especial would it not have given these bigots some trouble to determine by which of their two roads was reached the most momentous and sublime of all their truthsthe truththe fact of gravitation newton deduced it from the laws of kepler kepler admitted that these laws he guessedthese laws whose investigation disclosed to the greatest of british astronomers that principle the basis of all existing physical principle in going behind which we enter at once the nebulous kingdom of metaphysics yesthese vital laws kepler guessedthat is to say he imagined them had he been asked to point out either the deductive or inductive route by which he attained them his reply might have beeni know nothing about routesbut i do know the machinery of the universe here it is i grasped it with my souli reached it through mere dint of intuition alas poor ignorant old man could not any metaphysician have told him that what he called intuition was but the conviction resulting from deductions or inductions of which the processes were so shadowy as to have escaped his consciousness eluded his reason or bidden defiance to his capacity of expression how great a pity it is that some moral philosopher had not enlightened him about all this how it would have comforted him on his deathbed to know that instead of having gone intuitively and thus unbecomingly he had in fact proceeded decorously and legitimatelythat is to say hogishly or at least ramishlyinto the vast halls where lay gleaming untended and hitherto untouched by mortal handunseen by mortal eyethe imperishable and priceless secrets of the universe  yes kepler was essentially a theorist but this title now of so much sanctity was in those ancient days a designation of supreme contempt it is only now that men begin to appreciate that divine old manto sympathize with the prophetical and poetical rhapsody of his evermemorable words for my part continues the unknown correspondent i glow with a sacred fire when i even think of them and feel that i shall never grow weary of their repetitionin concluding this letter let me have the real pleasure of transcribing them once againi care not whether my work be read now or by posterity i can afford to wait a century for readers when god himself has waited six thousand years for an observer i triumph i have stolen the golden secret of the egyptians i will indulge my sacred fury  here end my quotations from this very unaccountable and perhaps somewhat impertinent epistle and perhaps it would be folly to comment in any respect upon the chimerical not to say revolutionary fancies of the writerwhoever he isfancies so radically at war with the wellconsidered and wellsettled opinions of this age let us proceed then to our legitimate thesis the universe  this thesis admits a choice between two modes of discussionwe may ascend or descend beginning at our own point of viewat the earth on which we standwe may pass to the other planets of our systemthence to the sunthence to our system considered collectivelyand thence through other systems indefinitely outwards or commencing on high at some point as definite as we can make it or conceive it we may come down to the habitation of man usuallythat is to say in ordinary essays on astronomythe first of these two modes is with certain reservation adoptedthis for the obvious reason that astronomical facts merely and principles being the object that object is best fulfilled in stepping from the known because proximate gradually onward to the point where all certitude becomes lost in the remote for my present purpose howeverthat of enabling the mind to take in as if from afar and at one glance a distinct conception of the individual universeit is clear that a descent to small from greatto the outskirts from the centre if we could establish a centreto the end from the beginning if we could fancy a beginning would be the preferable course but for the difficulty if not impossibility of presenting in this course to the unastronomical a picture at all comprehensible in regard to such considerations as are involved in quantitythat is to say in number magnitude and distance  now distinctnessintelligibility at all points is a primary feature in my general design on important topics it is better to be a good deal prolix than even a very little obscure but abstruseness is a quality appertaining to no subject per se all are alike in facility of comprehension to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps it is merely because a steppingstone here and there is heedlessly left unsupplied in our road to the differential calculus that this latter is not altogether as simple a thing as a sonnet by mr solomon seesaw  by way of admitting then no chance for misapprehension i think it advisable to proceed as if even the more obvious facts of astronomy were unknown to the reader in combining the two modes of discussion to which i have referred i propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar to eachand very especially of the iteration in detail which will be unavoidable as a consequence of the plan commencing with a descent i shall reserve for the return upwards those indispensable considerations of quantity to which allusion has already been made  let us begin then at once with that merest of words infinity this like god spirit and some other expressions of which the equivalents exist in all languages is by no means the expression of an ideabut of an effort at one it stands for the possible attempt at an impossible conception man needed a term by which to point out the direction of this effortthe cloud behind which lay forever invisible the object of this attempt a word in fine was demanded by means of which one human being might put himself in relation at once with another human being and with a certain tendency of the human intellect out of this demand arose the word infinity which is thus the representative but of the thought of a thought  as regards that infinity now consideredthe infinity of spacewe often hear it said that its idea is admitted by the mindis acquiesced inis entertainedon account of the greater difficulty which attends the conception of a limit but this is merely one of those phrases by which even profound thinkers time out of mind have occasionally taken pleasure in deceiving themselves the quibble lies concealed in the word difficulty the mind we are told entertains the idea of limitless through the greater difficulty which it finds in entertaining that of limited space now were the proposition but fairly put its absurdity would become transparent at once clearly there is no mere difficulty in the case the assertion intended if presented according to its intention and without sophistry would run thusthe mind admits the idea of limitless through the greater impossibility of entertaining that of limited space  it must be immediately seen that this is not a question of two statements between whose respective credibilitiesor of two arguments between whose respective validitiesthe reason is called upon to decideit is a matter of two conceptions directly conflicting and each avowedly impossible one of which the intellect is supposed to be capable of entertaining on account of the greater impossibility of entertaining the other the choice is not made between two difficultiesit is merely fancied to be made between two impossibilities now of the former there are degreesbut of the latter nonejust as our impertinent letterwriter has already suggested a task may be more or less difficult but it is either possible or not possiblethere are no gradations it might be more difficult to overthrow the andes than an anthill but it can be no more impossible to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of the other a man may jump ten feet with less difficulty than he can jump twenty but the impossibility of his leaping to the moon is not a whit less than that of his leaping to the dogstar  since all this is undeniable since the choice of the mind is to be made between impossibilities of conception since one impossibility cannot be greater than another and since thus one cannot be preferred to another the philosophers who not only maintain on the grounds mentioned mans idea of infinity but on account of such supposititious idea infinity itselfare plainly engaged in demonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is that some one other thingis impossible too this it will be said is nonsense and perhaps it isindeed i think it very capital nonsensebut forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine  the readiest mode however of displaying the fallacy of the philosophical argument on this question is by simply adverting to a fact respecting it which has been hitherto quite overlookedthe fact that the argument alluded to both proves and disproves its own proposition the mind is impelled say the theologians and others to admit a first cause by the superior difficulty it experiences in conceiving cause beyond cause without end the quibble as before lies in the word difficultybut here what is it employed to sustain a first cause and what is a first cause an ultimate termination of causes and what is an ultimate termination of causes finitythe finite thus the one quibble in two processes by god knows how many philosophers is made to support now finity and now infinitycould it not be brought to support something besides as for the quibblersthey at least are insupportable butto dismiss themwhat they prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they demonstrate in the other  of course no one will suppose that i here contend for the absolute impossibility of that which we attempt to convey in the word infinity my purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove infinity itself or even our conception of it by any such blundering ratiocination as that which is ordinarily employed  nevertheless as an individual i may be permitted to say that i cannot conceive infinity and am convinced that no human being can a mind not thoroughly selfconsciousnot accustomed to the introspective analysis of its own operationswill it is true often deceive itself by supposing that it has entertained the conception of which we speak in the effort to entertain it we proceed step beyond stepwe fancy point still beyond point and so long as we continue the effort it may be said in fact that we are tending to the formation of the idea designed while the strength of the impression that we actually form or have formed it is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up the mental endeavor but it is in the act of discontinuing the endeavorof fulfilling as we think the ideaof putting the finishing stroke as we suppose to the conceptionthat we overthrow at once the whole fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and therefore definite point this fact however we fail to perceive on account of the absolute coincidence in time between the settling down upon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in thinkingin attempting on the other hand to frame the idea of a limited space we merely converse the processes which involve the impossibility  we believe in a god we may or may not believe in finite or in infinite space but our belief in such cases is more properly designated as faith and is a matter quite distinct from that belief properfrom that intellectual beliefwhich presupposes the mental conception  the fact is that upon the enunciation of any one of that class of terms to which infinity belongsthe class representing thoughts of thoughthe who has a right to say that he thinks at all feels himself called upon not to entertain a conception but simply to direct his mental vision toward some given point in the intellectual firmament where lies a nebula never to be resolved to solve it indeed he makes no effort for with a rapid instinct he comprehends not only the impossibility but as regards all human purposes the inessentiality of its solution he perceives that the deity has not designed it to be solved he sees at once that it lies out of the brain of man and even how if not exactly why it lies out of it there are people i am aware who busying themselves in attempts at the unattainable acquire very easily by dint of the jargon they emit among those thinkersthattheythink with whom darkness and depth are synonymous a kind of cuttlefish reputation for profundity but the finest quality of thought is its selfcognizance and with some little equivocation it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater than that which extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain shuts out even these boundaries themselves from comprehension  it will now be understood that in using the phrase infinity of space i make no call upon the reader to entertain the impossible conception of an absolute infinity i refer simply to the utmost conceivable expanse of spacea shadowy and fluctuating domain now shrinking now swelling in accordance with the vacillating energies of the imagination  hitherto the universe of stars has always been considered as coincident with the universe proper as i have defined it in the commencement of this discourse it has been always either directly or indirectly assumedat least since the dawn of intelligible astronomythat were it possible for us to attain any given point in space we should still find on all sides of us an interminable succession of stars this was the untenable idea of pascal when making perhaps the most successful attempt ever made at periphrasing the conception for which we struggle in the word universe it is a sphere he says of which the centre is everywhere the circumference nowhere but although this intended definition is in fact no definition of the universe of stars we may accept it with some mental reservation as a definition rigorous enough for all practical purposes of the universe properthat is to say of the universe of space this latter then let us regard as a sphere of which the centre is everywhere the circumference nowhere in fact while we find it impossible to fancy an end to space we have no difficulty in picturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of beginnings  as our startingpoint then let us adopt the godhead of this godhead in itself he alone is not imbecilehe alone is not impious who propoundsnothing nous ne connaissons rien says the baron de bielfeldnous ne connaissons rien de la nature ou de lessence de dieupour savoir ce quil est il faut être dieu mêmewe know absolutely nothing of the nature or essence of godin order to comprehend what he is we should have to be god ourselves  we should have to be god ourselveswith a phrase so startling as this yet ringing in my ears i nevertheless venture to demand if this our present ignorance of the deity is an ignorance to which the soul is everlastingly condemned  by him howevernow at least the incomprehensibleby himassuming him as spiritthat is to say as not mattera distinction which for all intelligible purposes will stand well instead of a definitionby him then existing as spirit let us content ourselves tonight with supposing to have been created or made out of nothing by dint of his volitionat some point of space which we will take as a centreat some period into which we do not pretend to inquire but at all events immensely remoteby him then again let us suppose to have been createdwhat this is a vitally momentous epoch in our considerations what is it that we are justifiedthat alone we are justified in supposing to have been primarily and solely created  we have attained a point where only intuition can aid usbut now let me recur to the idea which i have already suggested as that alone which we can properly entertain of intuition it is but the conviction arising from those inductions or deductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to escape our consciousness elude our reason or defy our capacity of expression with this understanding i now assertthat an intuition altogether irresistible although inexpressible forces me to the conclusion that what god originally createdthat that matter which by dint of his volition he first made from his spirit or from nihility could have been nothing but matter in its utmost conceivable state ofwhatof simplicity  this will be found the sole absolute assumption of my discourse i use the word assumption in its ordinary sense yet i maintain that even this my primary proposition is very very far indeed from being really a mere assumption nothing was ever more certainlyno human conclusion was ever in fact more regularlymore rigorously deducedbut alas the processes lie out of the human analysisat all events are beyond the utterance of the human tongue  let us now endeavor to conceive what matter must be when or if in its absolute extreme of simplicity here the reason flies at once to imparticularityto a particleto one particlea particle of one kindof one characterof one natureof one sizeof one forma particle therefore without form and voida particle positively a particle at all pointsa particle absolutely unique individual undivided and not indivisible only because he who created it by dint of his will can by an infinitely less energetic exercise of the same will as a matter of course divide it  oneness then is all that i predicate of the originally created matter but i propose to show that this oneness is a principle abundantly sufficient to account for the constitution the existing phænomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the material universe  the willing into being the primordial particle has completed the act or more properly the conception of creation we now proceed to the ultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the particle createdthat is to say the ultimate purpose so far as our considerations yet enable us to see itthe constitution of the universe from it the particle  this constitution has been effected by forcing the originally and therefore normally one into the abnormal condition of many an action of this character implies rëaction a diffusion from unity under the conditions involves a tendency to return into unitya tendency ineradicable until satisfied but on these points i will speak more fully hereafter  the assumption of absolute unity in the primordial particle includes that of infinite divisibility let us conceive the particle then to be only not totally exhausted by diffusion into space from the one particle as a centre let us suppose to be irradiated sphericallyin all directionsto immeasurable but still to definite distances in the previously vacant spacea certain inexpressibly great yet limited number of unimaginably yet not infinitely minute atoms  now of these atoms thus diffused or upon diffusion what conditions are we permittednot to assume but to infer from consideration as well of their source as of the character of the design apparent in their diffusion unity being their source and difference from unity the character of the design manifested in their diffusion we are warranted in supposing this character to be at least generally preserved throughout the design and to form a portion of the design itselfthat is to say we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at all points from the uniquity and simplicity of the origin but for these reasons shall we be justified in imagining the atoms heterogeneous dissimilar unequal and inequidistant more explicitlyare we to consider no two atoms as at their diffusion of the same nature or of the same form or of the same sizeand after fulfilment of their diffusion into space is absolute inequidistance each from each to be understood of all of them in such arrangement under such conditions we most easily and immediately comprehend the subsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design as that which i have suggestedthe design of variety out of unitydiversity out of samenessheterogeneity out of homogeneitycomplexity out of simplicityin a word the utmost possible multiplicity of relation out of the emphatically irrelative one undoubtedly therefore we should be warranted in assuming all that has been mentioned but for the reflection first that supererogation is not presumable of any divine act and secondly that the object supposed in view appears as feasible when some of the conditions in question are dispensed with in the beginning as when all are understood immediately to exist i mean to say that some are involved in the rest or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the distinction inappreciable difference of size for example will at once be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second in preference to a third on account of particular inequidistance which is to be comprehended as particular inequidistances between centres of quantity in neighboring atoms of different forma matter not at all interfering with the generallyequable distribution of the atoms difference of kind too is easily conceived to be merely a result of differences in size and form taken more or less conjointlyin fact since the unity of the particle proper implies absolute homogeneity we cannot imagine the atoms at their diffusion differing in kind without imagining at the same time a special exercise of the divine will at the emission of each atom for the purpose of effecting in each a change of its essential natureso fantastic an idea is the less to be indulged as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly attainable without such minute and elaborate interposition we perceive therefore upon the whole that it would be supererogatory and consequently unphilosophical to predicate of the atoms in view of their purposes any thing more than difference of form at their dispersion with particular inequidistance after itall other differences arising at once out of these in the very first processes of massconstitutionwe thus establish the universe on a purely geometrical basis of course it is by no means necessary to assume absolute difference even of form among all the atoms irradiatedany more than absolute particular inequidistance of each from each we are required to conceive merely that no neighboring atoms are of similar formno atoms which can ever approximate until their inevitable rëunition at the end  although the immediate and perpetual tendency of the disunited atoms to return into their normal unity is implied as i have said in their abnormal diffusion still it is clear that this tendency will be without consequencea tendency and no moreuntil the diffusive energy in ceasing to be exerted shall leave it the tendency free to seek its satisfaction the divine act however being considered as determinate and discontinued on fulfilment of the diffusion we understand at once a rëactionin other words a satisfiable tendency of the disunited atoms to return into one  but the diffusive energy being withdrawn and the rëaction having commenced in furtherance of the ultimate designthat of the utmost possible relationthis design is now in danger of being frustrated in detail by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect its accomplishment in general multiplicity is the object but there is nothing to prevent proximate atoms from lapsing at once through the now satisfiable tendencybefore the fulfilment of any ends proposed in multiplicityinto absolute oneness among themselvesthere is nothing to impede the aggregation of various unique masses at various points of spacein other words nothing to interfere with the accumulation of various masses each absolutely one  for the effectual and thorough completion of the general design we thus see the necessity for a repulsion of limited capacitya separative something which on withdrawal of the diffusive volition shall at the same time allow the approach and forbid the junction of the atoms suffering them infinitely to approximate while denying them positive contact in a word having the powerup to a certain epochof preventing their coalition but no ability to interfere with their coalescence in any respect or degree the repulsion already considered as so peculiarly limited in other regards must be understood let me repeat as having power to prevent absolute coalition only up to a certain epoch unless we are to conceive that the appetite for unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied neverunless we are to conceive that what had a beginning is to have no enda conception which cannot really be entertained however much we may talk or dream of entertaining itwe are forced to conclude that the repulsive influence imagined will finallyunder pressure of the unitendency collectively applied but never and in no degree until on fulfilment of the divine purposes such collective application shall be naturally madeyield to a force which at that ultimate epoch shall be the superior force precisely to the extent required and thus permit the universal subsidence into the inevitable because original and therefore normal onethe conditions here to be reconciled are difficult indeedwe cannot even comprehend the possibility of their conciliationnevertheless the apparent impossibility is brilliantly suggestive  that the repulsive something actually exists we see man neither employs nor knows a force sufficient to bring two atoms into contact this is but the wellestablished proposition of the impenetrability of matter all experiment provesall philosophy admits it the design of the repulsionthe necessity for its existencei have endeavored to show but from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously abstained this on account of an intuitive conviction that the principle at issue is strictly spirituallies in a recess impervious to our present understandinglies involved in a consideration of what nowin our human stateis not to be consideredin a consideration of spirit in itself i feel in a word that here the god has interposed and here only because here and here only the knot demanded the interposition of the god  in fact while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into unity will be recognized at once as the principle of the newtonian gravity what i have spoken of as a repulsive influence prescribing limits to the immediate satisfaction of the tendency will be understood as that which we have been in the practice of designating now as heat now as magnetism now as electricity displaying our ignorance of its awful character in the vacillation of the phraseology with which we endeavor to circumscribe it  calling it merely for the moment electricity we know that all experimental analysis of electricity has given as an ultimate result the principle or seeming principle heterogeneity only where things differ is electricity apparent and it is presumable that they never differ where it is not developed at least if not apparent now this result is in the fullest keeping with that which i have reached unempirically the design of the repulsive influence i have maintained to be that of preventing immediate unity among the diffused atoms and these atoms are represented as different each from each difference is their charactertheir essentialityjust as nodifference was the essentiality of their source when we say then that an attempt to bring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort on the part of the repulsive influence to prevent the contact we may as well use the strictly convertible sentence that an attempt to bring together any two differences will result in a development of electricity all existing bodies of course are composed of these atoms in proximate contact and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more or fewer differences and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit on bringing together any two such assemblages would be in the ratio of the two sums of the differences in eachan expression which when reduced is equivalent to thisthe amount of electricity developed on the approximation of two bodies is proportional to the difference between the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are composed that no two bodies are absolutely alike is a simple corollary from all that has been here said electricity therefore existing always is developed whenever any bodies but manifested only when bodies of appreciable difference are brought into approximation  to electricityso for the present continuing to call itwe may not be wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light heat and magnetism but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to this strictly spiritual principle the more important phænomena of vitality consciousness and thought on this topic however i need pause here merely to suggest that these phænomena whether observed generally or in detail seem to proceed at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous  discarding now the two equivocal terms gravitation and electricity let us adopt the more definite expressions attraction and repulsion the former is the body the latter the soul the one is the material the other the spiritual principle of the universe no other principles exist all phænomena are referable to one or to the other or to both combined so rigorously is this the caseso thoroughly demonstrable is it that attraction and repulsion are the sole properties through which we perceive the universein other words by which matter is manifested to mindthat for all merely argumentative purposes we are fully justified in assuming that matter exists only as attraction and repulsionthat attraction and repulsion are matterthere being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term matter and the terms attraction and repulsion taken together as equivalent and therefore convertible expressions in logic  i said just now that what i have described as the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into their original unity would be understood as the principle of the newtonian law of gravity and in fact there can be little difficulty in such an understanding if we look at the newtonian gravity in a merely general view as a force impelling matter to seek matter that is to say when we pay no attention to the known modus operandi of the newtonian force the general coincidence satisfies us but upon looking closely we see in detail much that appears incoincident and much in regard to which no coincidence at least is established for example the newtonian gravity when we think of it in certain moods does not seem to be a tendency to oneness at all but rather a tendency of all bodies in all directionsa phrase apparently expressive of a tendency to diffusion here then is an incoincidence again when we reflect on the mathematical law governing the newtonian tendency we see clearly that no coincidence has been made good in respect of the modus operandi at least between gravitation as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct tendency which i have assumed  in fact i have attained a point at which it will be advisable to strengthen my position by reversing my processes so far we have gone on à priori from an abstract consideration of simplicity as that quality most likely to have characterized the original action of god let us now see whether the established facts of the newtonian gravitation may not afford us à posteriori some legitimate inductions  what does the newtonian law declarethat all bodies attract each other with forces proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the squares of their distances purposely i have here given in the first place the vulgar version of the law and i confess that in this as in most other vulgar versions of great truths we find little of a suggestive character let us now adopt a more philosophical phraseologyevery atom of every body attracts every other atom both of its own and of every other body with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances between the attracting and attracted atomhere indeed a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind  but let us see distinctly what it was that newton provedaccording to the grossly irrational definitions of proof prescribed by the metaphysical schools he was forced to content himself with showing how thoroughly the motions of an imaginary universe composed of attracting and attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced coincide with those of the actually existing universe so far as it comes under our observation this was the amount of his demonstrationthat is to say this was the amount of it according to the conventional cant of the philosophies his successes added proof multiplied by proofsuch proof as a sound intellect admitsbut the demonstration of the law itself persist the metaphysicians had not been strengthened in any degree ocular physical proof however of attraction here upon earth in accordance with the newtonian theory was at length much to the satisfaction of some intellectual grovellers afforded this proof arose collaterally and incidentally as nearly all important truths have arisen out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the earth in the famous maskelyne cavendish and bailly experiments for this purpose the attraction of the mass of a mountain was seen felt measured and found to be mathematically consistent with the immortal theory of the british astronomer  but in spite of this confirmation of that which needed nonein spite of the socalled corroboration of the theory by the socalled ocular and physical proofin spite of the character of this corroborationthe ideas which even really philosophical men cannot help imbibing of gravityand especially the ideas of it which ordinary men get and contentedly maintain are seen to have been derived for the most part from a consideration of the principle as they find it developedmerely in the planet upon which they stand  now to what does so partial a consideration tendto what species of error does it give rise on the earth we see and feel only that gravity impels all bodies towards the centre of the earth no man in the common walks of life could be made to see or to feel anything elsecould be made to perceive that anything anywhere has a perpetual gravitating tendency in any other direction than to the centre of the earth yet with an exception hereafter to be specified it is a fact that every earthly thing not to speak now of every heavenly thing has a tendency not only to the earths centre but in every conceivable direction besides  now although the philosophic cannot be said to err with the vulgar in this matter they nevertheless permit themselves to be influenced without knowing it by the sentiment of the vulgar idea although the pagan fables are not believed says bryant in his very erudite mythology yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as from existing realities i mean to assert that the merely sensitive perception of gravity as we experience it on earth beguiles mankind into the fancy of concentralization or especiality respecting ithas been continually biasing towards this fancy even the mightiest intellectsperpetually although imperceptibly leading them away from the real characteristics of the principle thus preventing them up to this date from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth which lies in a diametrically opposite directionbehind the principles essential characteristicsthose not of concentralization or especialitybut of universality and diffusion this vital truth is unity as the source of the phænomenon  let me now repeat the definition of gravityevery atom of every body attracts every other atom both of its own and of every other body with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of the attracting and attracted atom  here let the reader pause with me for a moment in contemplation of the miraculousof the ineffableof the altogether unimaginable complexity of relation involved in the fact that each atom attracts every other atominvolved merely in this fact of the attraction without reference to the law or mode in which the attraction is manifestedinvolved merely in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom at all in a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the composition of a cannonball exceed probably in mere point of number all the stars which go to the constitution of the universe  had we discovered simply that each atom tended to some one favorite pointto some especially attractive atomwe should still have fallen upon a discovery which in itself would have sufficed to overwhelm the mindbut what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend that each atom attractssympathizes with the most delicate movements of every other atom and with each and with all at the same time and forever and according to a determinate law of which the complexity even considered by itself solely is utterly beyond the grasp of the imagination of man if i propose to ascertain the influence of one mote in a sunbeam upon its neighboring mote i cannot accomplish my purpose without first counting and weighing all the atoms in the universe and defining the precise positions of all at one particular moment if i venture to displace by even the billionth part of an inch the microscopical speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my finger what is the character of that act upon which i have adventured i have done a deed which shakes the moon in her path which causes the sun to be no longer the sun and which alters forever the destiny of the multitudinous myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic presence of their creator  these ideasconceptions such as theseunthoughtlike thoughtssoulreveries rather than conclusions or even considerations of the intellectideas i repeat such as these are such as we can alone hope profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great principle attraction  but nowwith such ideaswith such a vision of the marvellous complexity of attraction fairly in his mindlet any person competent of thought on such topics as these set himself to the task of imagining a principle for the phænomena observeda condition from which they sprang  does not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common parentage does not a sympathy so omniprevalent so ineradicable and so thoroughly irrespective suggest a common paternity as its source does not one extreme impel the reason to the other does not the infinitude of division refer to the utterness of individuality does not the entireness of the complex hint at the perfection of the simple it is not that the atoms as we see them are divided or that they are complex in their relationsbut that they are inconceivably divided and unutterably complexit is the extremeness of the conditions to which i now allude rather than to the conditions themselves in a word is it not because the atoms were at some remote epoch of time even more than togetheris it not because originally and therefore normally they were onethat now in all circumstancesat all pointsin all directionsby all modes of approachin all relations and through all conditionsthey struggle back to this absolutely this irrelatively this unconditionally one  some person may here demandwhysince it is to the one that the atoms struggle backdo we not find and define attraction a merely general tendency to a centrewhy in especial do not your atomsthe atoms which you describe as having been irradiated from a centreproceed at once rectilinearly back to the central point of their origin  i reply that they do as will be distinctly shown but that the cause of their so doing is quite irrespective of the centre as such they all tend rectilinearly towards a centre because of the sphereicity with which they have been irradiated into space each atom forming one of a generally uniform globe of atoms finds more atoms in the direction of the centre of course than in any other and in that direction therefore is impelledbut is not thus impelled because the centre is the point of its origin it is not to any point that the atoms are allied it is not any locality either in the concrete or in the abstract to which i suppose them bound nothing like location was conceived as their origin their source lies in the principle unity this is their lost parent this they seek alwaysimmediatelyin all directionswherever it is even partially to be found thus appeasing in some measure the ineradicable tendency while on the way to its absolute satisfaction in the end it follows from all this that any principle which shall be adequate to account for the law or modus operandi of the attractive force in general will account for this law in particularthat is to say any principle which will show why the atoms should tend to their general centre of irradiation with forces inversely proportional to the squares of the distances will be admitted as satisfactorily accounting at the same time for the tendency according to the same law of these atoms each to eachfor the tendency to the centre is merely the tendency each to each and not any tendency to a centre as suchthus it will be seen also that the establishment of my propositions would involve no necessity of modification in the terms of the newtonian definition of gravity which declares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth and declares this merely but always under the supposition that what i propose be in the end admitted it seems clear that some error might occasionally be avoided in the future processes of science were a more ample phraseology adoptedfor instanceeach atom tends to every other atom c with a force c the general result being a tendency of all with a similar force to a general centre  the reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical result but while in the one process intuition was the startingpoint in the other it was the goal in commencing the former journey i could only say that with an irresistible intuition i felt simplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of godin ending the latter i can only declare that with an irresistible intuition i perceive unity to have been the source of the observed phænomena of the newtonian gravitation thus according to the schools i prove nothing so be iti design but to suggestand to convince through the suggestion i am proudly aware that there exist many of the most profound and cautiously discriminative human intellects which cannot help being abundantly content with mysuggestions to these intellectsas to my ownthere is no mathematical demonstration which could bring the least additional true proof of the great truth which i have advancedthe truth of original unity as the sourceas the principle of the universal phænomena for my part i am not so sure that i speak and seei am not so sure that my heart beats and that my soul livesof the rising of tomorrows suna probability that as yet lies in the futurei do not pretend to be one thousandth part as sureas i am of the irretrievably bygone fact that all things and all thoughts of things with all their ineffable multiplicity of relation sprang at once into being from the primordial and irrelative one  referring to the newtonian gravity dr nichol the eloquent author of the architecture of the heavens saysin truth we have no reason to suppose this great law as now revealed to be the ultimate or simplest and therefore the universal and allcomprehensive form of a great ordinance the mode in which its intensity diminishes with the element of distance has not the aspect of an ultimate principle which always assumes the simplicity and selfevidence of those axioms which constitute the basis of geometry  now it is quite true that ultimate principles in the common understanding of the words always assume the simplicity of geometrical axiomsas for selfevidence there is no such thingbut these principles are clearly not ultimate in other terms what we are in the habit of calling principles are no principles properly speakingsince there can be but one principle the volition of god we have no right to assume then from what we observe in rules that we choose foolishly to name principles anything at all in respect to the characteristics of a principle proper the ultimate principles of which dr nichol speaks as having geometrical simplicity may and do have this geometrical turn as being part and parcel of a vast geometrical system and thus a system of simplicity itselfin which nevertheless the truly ultimate principle is as we know the consummation of the complexthat is to say of the unintelligiblefor is it not the spiritual capacity of god  i quoted dr nichols remark however not so much to question its philosophy as by way of calling attention to the fact that while all men have admitted some principle as existing behind the law of gravity no attempt has been yet made to point out what this principle in particular isif we except perhaps occasional fantastic efforts at referring it to magnetism or mesmerism or swedenborgianism or transcendentalism or some other equally delicious ism of the same species and invariably patronized by one and the same species of people the great mind of newton while boldly grasping the law itself shrank from the principle of the law the more fluent and comprehensive at least if not the more patient and profound sagacity of laplace had not the courage to attack it but hesitation on the part of these two astronomers it is perhaps not so very difficult to understand they as well as all the first class of mathematicians were mathematicians solelytheir intellect at least had a firmlypronounced mathematicophysical tone what lay not distinctly within the domain of physics or of mathematics seemed to them either nonentity or shadow nevertheless we may well wonder that leibnitz who was a marked exception to the general rule in these respects and whose mental temperament was a singular admixture of the mathematical with the physicometaphysical did not at once investigate and establish the point at issue either newton or laplace seeking a principle and discovering none physical would have rested contentedly in the conclusion that there was absolutely none but it is almost impossible to fancy of leibnitz that having exhausted in his search the physical dominions he would not have stepped at once boldly and hopefully amid his old familiar haunts in the kingdom of metaphysics here indeed it is clear that he must have adventured in search of the treasurethat he did not find it after all was perhaps because his fairy guide imagination was not sufficiently wellgrown or welleducated to direct him aright  i observed just now that in fact there had been certain vague attempts at referring gravity to some very uncertain isms these attempts however although considered bold and justly so considered looked no farther than to the generalitythe merest generalityof the newtonian law its modus operandi has never to my knowledge been approached in the way of an effort at explanation it is therefore with no unwarranted fear of being taken for a madman at the outset and before i can bring my propositions fairly to the eye of those who alone are competent to decide upon them that i here declare the modus operandi of the law of gravity to be an exceedingly simple and perfectly explicable thingthat is to say when we make our advances towards it in just gradations and in the true directionwhen we regard it from the proper point of view  whether we reach the idea of absolute unity as the source of all things from a consideration of simplicity as the most probable characteristic of the original action of godwhether we arrive at it from an inspection of the universality of relation in the gravitating phænomenaor whether we attain it as a result of the mutual corroboration afforded by both processesstill the idea itself if entertained at all is entertained in inseparable connection with another ideathat of the condition of the universe of stars as we now perceive itthat is to say a condition of immeasurable diffusion through space now a connection between these two ideasunity and diffusioncannot be established unless through the entertainment of a third ideathat of irradiation absolute unity being taken as a centre then the existing universe of stars is the result of irradiation from that centre  now the laws of irradiation are known they are part and parcel of the sphere they belong to the class of indisputable geometrical properties we say of them they are truethey are evident to demand why they are true would be to demand why the axioms are true upon which their demonstration is based nothing is demonstrable strictly speaking but if anything be then the propertiesthe laws in question are demonstrated  but these lawswhat do they declare irradiationhowby what steps does it proceed outwardly from a centre  from a luminous centre light issues by irradiation and the quantities of light received upon any given plane supposed to be shifting its position so as to be now nearer the centre and now farther from it will be diminished in the same proportion as the squares of the distances of the plane from the luminous body are increased and will be increased in the same proportion as these squares are diminished  the expression of the law may be thus generalizedthe number of lightparticles or if the phrase be preferred the number of lightimpressions received upon the shifting plane will be inversely proportional with the squares of the distances of the plane generalizing yet again we may say that the diffusionthe scatteringthe irradiation in a wordis directly proportional with the squares of the distances  illustration  for example at the distance b from the luminous centre a a certain number of particles are so diffused as to occupy the surface b then at double the distancethat is to say at cthey will be so much farther diffused as to occupy four such surfacesat treble the distance or at d they will be so much farther separated as to occupy nine such surfaceswhile at quadruple the distance or at e they will have become so scattered as to spread themselves over sixteen such surfacesand so on forever  in saying generally that the irradiation proceeds in direct proportion with the squares of the distances we use the term irradiation to express the degree of the diffusion as we proceed outwardly from the centre conversing the idea and employing the word concentralization to express the degree of the drawing together as we come back toward the centre from an outward position we may say that concentralization proceeds inversely as the squares of the distances in other words we have reached the conclusion that on the hypothesis that matter was originally irradiated from a centre and is now returning to it the concentralization in the return proceeds exactly as we know the force of gravitation to proceed  now here if we could be permitted to assume that concentralization exactly represented the force of the tendency to the centrethat the one was exactly proportional to the other and that the two proceeded togetherwe should have shown all that is required the sole difficulty existing then is to establish a direct proportion between concentralization and the force of concentralization and this is done of course if we establish such proportion between irradiation and the force of irradiation  a very slight inspection of the heavens assures us that the stars have a certain general uniformity equability or equidistance of distribution through that region of space in which collectively and in a roughly globular form they are situatedthis species of very general rather than absolute equability being in full keeping with my deduction of inequidistance within certain limits among the originally diffused atoms as a corollary from the evident design of infinite complexity of relation out of irrelation i started it will be remembered with the idea of a generally uniform but particularly ununiform distribution of the atomsan idea i repeat which an inspection of the stars as they exist confirms  but even in the merely general equability of distribution as regards the atoms there appears a difficulty which no doubt has already suggested itself to those among my readers who have borne in mind that i suppose this equability of distribution effected through irradiation from a centre the very first glance at the idea irradiation forces us to the entertainment of the hitherto unseparated and seemingly inseparable idea of agglomeration about a centre with dispersion as we recede from itthe idea in a word of inequability of distribution in respect to the matter irradiated  now i have elsewhere observed that it is by just such difficulties as the one now in questionsuch roughnessessuch peculiaritiessuch protuberances above the plane of the ordinarythat reason feels her way if at all in her search for the true by the difficultythe peculiaritynow presented i leap at once to the secreta secret which i might never have attained but for the peculiarity and the inferences which in its mere character of peculiarity it affords me       murders in the rue morguep   the process of thought at this point may be thus roughly sketchedi say to myselfunity as i have explained it is a truthi feel it diffusion is a truthi see it irradiation by which alone these two truths are reconciled is a consequent truthi perceive it equability of diffusion first deduced à priori and then corroborated by the inspection of phænomena is also a truthi fully admit it so far all is clear around methere are no clouds behind which the secretthe great secret of the gravitating modus operandican possibly lie hiddenbut this secret lies hereabouts most assuredly and were there but a cloud in view i should be driven to suspicion of that cloud and now just as i say this there actually comes a cloud into view this cloud is the seeming impossibility of reconciling my truth irradiation with my truth equability of diffusion i say nowbehind this seeming impossibility is to be found what i desire i do not say real impossibility for invincible faith in my truths assures me that it is a mere difficulty after allbut i go on to say with unflinching confidence that when this difficulty shall be solved we shall find wrapped up in the process of solution the key to the secret at which we aim moreoveri feel that we shall discover but one possible solution of the difficulty this for the reason that were there two one would be supererogatorywould be fruitlesswould be emptywould contain no keysince no duplicate key can be needed to any secret of nature  and now let us seeour usual notions of irradiationin fact all our distinct notions of itare caught merely from the process as we see it exemplified in light here there is a continuous outpouring of raystreams and with a force which we have at least no right to suppose varies at all now in any such irradiation as thiscontinuous and of unvarying forcethe regions nearer the centre must inevitably be always more crowded with the irradiated matter than the regions more remote but i have assumed no such irradiation as this i assumed no continuous irradiation and for the simple reason that such an assumption would have involved first the necessity of entertaining a conception which i have shown no man can entertain and which as i will more fully explain hereafter all observation of the firmament refutesthe conception of the absolute infinity of the universe of starsand would have involved secondly the impossibility of understanding a rëactionthat is gravitationas existing nowsince while an act is continued no rëaction of course can take place my assumption then or rather my inevitable deduction from just premiseswas that of a determinate irradiationone finally discontinued  let me now describe the sole possible mode in which it is conceivable that matter could have been diffused through space so as to fulfil the conditions at once of irradiation and of generally equable distribution  for convenience of illustration let us imagine in the first place a hollow sphere of glass or of anything else occupying the space throughout which the universal matter is to be thus equally diffused by means of irradiation from the absolute irrelative unconditional particle placed in the centre of the sphere  now a certain exertion of the diffusive power presumed to be the divine volitionin other words a certain forcewhose measure is the quantity of matterthat is to say the number of atomsemitted emits by irradiation this certain number of atoms forcing them in all directions outwardly from the centretheir proximity to each other diminishing as they proceeduntil finally they are distributed loosely over the interior surface of the sphere  when these atoms have attained this position or while proceeding to attain it a second and inferior exercise of the same forceor a second and inferior force of the same characteremits in the same mannerthat is to say by irradiation as beforea second stratum of atoms which proceeds to deposit itself upon the first the number of atoms in this case as in the former being of course the measure of the force which emitted them in other words the force being precisely adapted to the purpose it effectsthe force and the number of atoms sent out by the force being directly proportional  when this second stratum has reached its destined positionor while approaching ita third still inferior exertion of the force or a third inferior force of a similar characterthe number of atoms emitted being in all cases the measure of the forceproceeds to deposit a third stratum upon the secondand so on until these concentric strata growing gradually less and less come down at length to the central point and the diffusive matter simultaneously with the diffusive force is exhausted  we have now the sphere filled through means of irradiation with atoms equably diffused the two necessary conditionsthose of irradiation and of equable diffusionare satisfied and by the sole process in which the possibility of their simultaneous satisfaction is conceivable for this reason i confidently expect to find lurking in the present condition of the atoms as distributed throughout the sphere the secret of which i am in searchthe allimportant principle of the modus operandi of the newtonian law let us examine then the actual condition of the atoms  they lie in a series of concentric strata they are equably diffused throughout the sphere they have been irradiated into these states  the atoms being equably distributed the greater the superficial extent of any of these concentric strata or spheres the more atoms will lie upon it in other words the number of atoms lying upon the surface of any one of the concentric spheres is directly proportional with the extent of that surface  but in any series of concentric spheres the surfaces are directly proportional with the squares of the distances from the centre       succinctlythe surfaces of spheres are as the squares of     their radii  therefore the number of atoms in any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that stratums distance from the centre  but the number of atoms in any stratum is the measure of the force which emitted that stratumthat is to say is directly proportional with the force  therefore the force which irradiated any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that stratums distance from the centreor generally  the force of the irradiation has been directly proportional with the squares of the distances  now rëaction as far as we know anything of it is action conversed the general principle of gravity being in the first place understood as the rëaction of an actas the expression of a desire on the part of matter while existing in a state of diffusion to return into the unity whence it was diffused and in the second place the mind being called upon to determine the character of the desirethe manner in which it would naturally be manifested in other words being called upon to conceive a probable law or modus operandi for the return could not well help arriving at the conclusion that this law of return would be precisely the converse of the law of departure that such would be the case any one at least would be abundantly justified in taking for granted until such time as some person should suggest something like a plausible reason why it should not be the caseuntil such period as a law of return shall be imagined which the intellect can consider as preferable  matter then irradiated into space with a force varying as the squares of the distances might à priori be supposed to return towards its centre of irradiation with a force varying inversely as the squares of the distances and i have already shown that any principle which will explain why the atoms should tend according to any law to the general centre must be admitted as satisfactorily explaining at the same time why according to the same law they should tend each to each for in fact the tendency to the general centre is not to a centre as such but because of its being a point in tending towards which each atom tends most directly to its real and essential centre unitythe absolute and final union of all       page   the consideration here involved presents to my own mind no embarrassment whateverbut this fact does not blind me to the possibility of its being obscure to those who may have been less in the habit of dealing with abstractionsand upon the whole it may be as well to look at the matter from one or two other points of view  the absolute irrelative particle primarily created by the volition of god must have been in a condition of positive normality or rightfulnessfor wrongfulness implies relation right is positive wrong is negativeis merely the negation of right as cold is the negation of heatdarkness of light that a thing may be wrong it is necessary that there be some other thing in relation to which it is wrongsome condition which it fails to satisfy some law which it violates some being whom it aggrieves if there be no such being law or condition in respect to which the thing is wrongand still more especially if no beings laws or conditions exist at allthen the thing cannot be wrong and consequently must be right any deviation from normality involves a tendency to return into it a difference from the normalfrom the rightfrom the justcan be understood as effected only by the overcoming a difficulty and if the force which overcomes the difficulty be not infinitely continued the ineradicable tendency to return will at length be permitted to act for its own satisfaction upon withdrawal of the force the tendency acts this is the principle of rëaction as the inevitable consequence of finite action employing a phraseology of which the seeming affectation will be pardoned for its expressiveness we may say that rëaction is the return from the condition of as it is and ought not to be into the condition of as it was originally and therefore ought to beand let me add here that the absolute force of rëaction would no doubt be always found in direct proportion with the realitythe truththe absolutenessof the originalityif ever it were possible to measure this latterand consequently the greatest of all conceivable reactions must be that produced by the tendency which we now discussthe tendency to return into the absolutely originalinto the supremely primitive gravity then must be the strongest of forcesan idea reached à priori and abundantly confirmed by induction what use i make of the idea will be seen in the sequel  the atoms now having been diffused from their normal condition of unity seek to return towhat not to any particular point certainly for it is clear that if upon the diffusion the whole universe of matter had been projected collectively to a distance from the point of irradiation the atomic tendency to the general centre of the sphere would not have been disturbed in the leastthe atoms would not have sought the point in absolute space from which they were originally impelled it is merely the condition and not the point or locality at which this condition took its rise that these atoms seek to reestablishit is merely that condition which is their normality that they desire but they seek a centre it will be said and a centre is a point true but they seek this point not in its character of pointfor were the whole sphere moved from its position they would seek equally the centre and the centre then would be a new pointbut because it so happens on account of the form in which they collectively existthat of the spherethat only through the point in questionthe spheres centrethey can attain their true object unity in the direction of the centre each atom perceives more atoms than in any other direction each atom is impelled towards the centre because along the straight line joining it and the centre and passing on to the circumference beyond there lie a greater number of atoms than along any other straight linea greater number of objects that seek it the individual atoma greater number of tendencies to unitya greater number of satisfactions for its own tendency to unityin a word because in the direction of the centre lies the utmost possibility of satisfaction generally for its own individual appetite to be brief the condition unity is all that is really sought and if the atoms seem to seek the centre of the sphere it is only impliedly through implicationbecause such centre happens to imply to include or to involve the only essential centre unity but on account of this implication or involution there is no possibility of practically separating the tendency to unity in the abstract from the tendency to the concrete centre thus the tendency of the atoms to the general centre is to all practical intents and for all logical purposes the tendency each to each and the tendency each to each is the tendency to the centre and the one tendency may be assumed as the other whatever will apply to the one must be thoroughly applicable to the other and in conclusion whatever principle will satisfactorily explain the one cannot be questioned as an explanation of the other  in looking carefully around me for rational objection to what i have advanced i am able to discover nothingbut of that class of objections usually urged by the doubters for doubts sake i very readily perceive three and proceed to dispose of them in order  it may be said first the proof that the force of irradiation in the case described is directly proportional to the squares of the distances depends upon an unwarranted assumptionthat of the number of atoms in each stratum being the measure of the force with which they are emitted  i reply not only that i am warranted in such assumption but that i should be utterly unwarranted in any other what i assume is simply that an effect is the measure of its causethat every exercise of the divine will will be proportional to that which demands the exertionthat the means of omnipotence or of omniscience will be exactly adapted to its purposes neither can a deficiency nor an excess of cause bring to pass any effect had the force which irradiated any stratum to its position been either more or less than was needed for the purposethat is to say not directly proportional to the purposethen to its position that stratum could not have been irradiated had the force which with a view to general equability of distribution emitted the proper number of atoms for each stratum been not directly proportional to the number then the number would not have been the number demanded for the equable distribution  the second supposable objection is somewhat better entitled to an answer  it is an admitted principle in dynamics that every body on receiving an impulse or disposition to move will move onward in a straight line in the direction imparted by the impelling force until deflected or stopped by some other force how then it may be asked is my first or external stratum of atoms to be understood as discontinuing their movement at the circumference of the imaginary glass sphere when no second force of more than an imaginary character appears to account for the discontinuance  i reply that the objection in this case actually does arise out of an unwarranted assumptionon the part of the objectorthe assumption of a principle in dynamics at an epoch when no principles in anything existi use the word principle of course in the objectors understanding of the word  in the beginning we can admitindeed we can comprehendbut one first causethe truly ultimate principlethe volition of god the primary actthat of irradiation from unitymust have been independent of all that which the world now calls principlebecause all that we so designate is but a consequence of the rëaction of that primary acti say primary act for the creation of the absolute material particle is more properly to be regarded as a conception than as an act in the ordinary meaning of the term thus we must regard the primary act as an act for the establishment of what we now call principles but this primary act itself is to be considered as continuous volition the thought of god is to be understood as originating the diffusionas proceeding with itas regulating itand finally as being withdrawn from it upon its completion then commences rëaction and through rëaction principle as we employ the word it will be advisable however to limit the application of this word to the two immediate results of the discontinuance of the divine volitionthat is to the two agents attraction and repulsion every other natural agent depends either more or less immediately upon these two and therefore would be more conveniently designated as subprinciple  it may be objected thirdly that in general the peculiar mode of distribution which i have suggested for the atoms is an hypothesis and nothing more  now i am aware that the word hypothesis is a ponderous sledgehammer grasped immediately if not lifted by all very diminutive thinkers upon the first appearance of any proposition wearing in any particular the garb of a theory but hypothesis cannot be wielded here to any good purpose even by those who succeed in lifting itlittle men or great  i maintain first that only in the mode described is it conceivable that matter could have been diffused so as to fulfil at once the conditions of irradiation and of generally equable distribution i maintain secondly that these conditions themselves have been imposed upon me as necessities in a train of ratiocination as rigorously logical as that which establishes any demonstration in euclid and i maintain thirdly that even if the charge of hypothesis were as fully sustained as it is in fact unsustained and untenable still the validity and indisputability of my result would not even in the slightest particular be disturbed  to explainthe newtonian gravitya law of naturea law whose existence as such no one out of bedlam questionsa law whose admission as such enables us to account for ninetenths of the universal phænomenaa law which merely because it does so enable us to account for these phænomena we are perfectly willing without reference to any other considerations to admit and cannot help admitting as a lawa law nevertheless of which neither the principle nor the modus operandi of the principle has ever yet been traced by the human analysisa law in short which neither in its detail nor in its generality has been found susceptible of explanation at allis at length seen to be at every point thoroughly explicable provided only we yield our assent towhat to an hypothesis why if an hypothesisif the merest hypothesisif an hypothesis for whose assumptionas in the case of that pure hypothesis the newtonian law itselfno shadow of à priori reason could be assignedif an hypothesis even so absolute as all this implies would enable us to perceive a principle for the newtonian lawwould enable us to understand as satisfied conditions so miraculouslyso ineffably complex and seemingly irreconcileable as those involved in the relations of which gravity tells uswhat rational being could so expose his fatuity as to call even this absolute hypothesis an hypothesis any longerunless indeed he were to persist in so calling it with the understanding that he did so simply for the sake of consistency in words  but what is the true state of our present case what is the fact not only that it is not an hypothesis which we are required to adopt in order to admit the principle at issue explained but that it is a logical conclusion which we are requested not to adopt if we can avoid itwhich we are simply invited to deny if we cana conclusion of so accurate a logicality that to dispute it would be the effortto doubt its validity beyond our powera conclusion from which we see no mode of escape turn as we will a result which confronts us either at the end of an inductive journey from the phænomena of the very law discussed or at the close of a deductive career from the most rigorously simple of all conceivable assumptionsthe assumption in a word of simplicity itself  and if here for the mere sake of cavilling it be urged that although my startingpoint is as i assert the assumption of absolute simplicity yet simplicity considered merely in itself is no axiom and that only deductions from axioms are indisputableit is thus that i reply  every other science than logic is the science of certain concrete relations arithmetic for example is the science of the relations of numbergeometry of the relations of formmathematics in general of the relations of quantity in generalof whatever can be increased or diminished logic however is the science of relation in the abstractof absolute relationof relation considered solely in itself an axiom in any particular science other than logic is thus merely a proposition announcing certain concrete relations which seem to be too obvious for disputeas when we say for instance that the whole is greater than its partand thus again the principle of the logical axiomin other words of an axiom in the abstractis simply obviousness of relation now it is clear not only that what is obvious to one mind may not be obvious to another but that what is obvious to one mind at one epoch may be anything but obvious at another epoch to the same mind it is clear moreover that what today is obvious even to the majority of mankind or to the majority of the best intellects of mankind may tomorrow be to either majority more or less obvious or in no respect obvious at all it is seen then that the axiomatic principle itself is susceptible of variation and of course that axioms are susceptible of similar change being mutable the truths which grow out of them are necessarily mutable too or in other words are never to be positively depended upon as truths at allsince truth and immutability are one  it will now be readily understood that no axiomatic ideano idea founded in the fluctuating principle obviousness of relationcan possibly be so secureso reliable a basis for any structure erected by the reason as that ideawhatever it is wherever we can find it or if it be practicable to find it anywherewhich is irrelative altogetherwhich not only presents to the understanding no obviousness of relation either greater or less to be considered but subjects the intellect not in the slightest degree to the necessity of even looking at any relation at all if such an idea be not what we too heedlessly term an axiom it is at least preferable as a logical basis to any axiom ever propounded or to all imaginable axioms combinedand such precisely is the idea with which my deductive process so thoroughly corroborated by induction commences my particle proper is but absolute irrelation to sum up what has been here advancedas a starting point i have taken it for granted simply that the beginning had nothing behind it or before itthat it was a beginning in factthat it was a beginning and nothing different from a beginningin short that this beginning wasthat which it was if this be a mere assumption then a mere assumption let it be  to conclude this branch of the subjecti am fully warranted in announcing that the law which we have been in the habit of calling gravity exists on account of matters having been irradiated at its origin atomically into a limited sphere of space from one individual unconditional irrelative and absolute particle proper by the sole process in which it was possible to satisfy at the same time the two conditions irradiation and generallyequable distribution throughout the spherethat is to say by a force varying in direct proportion with the squares of the distances between the irradiated atoms respectively and the particular centre of irradiation       limited spherea sphere is necessarily limited i prefer     tautology to a chance of misconception  i have already given my reasons for presuming matter to have been diffused by a determinate rather than by a continuous or infinitely continued force supposing a continuous force we should be unable in the first place to comprehend a rëaction at all and we should be required in the second place to entertain the impossible conception of an infinite extension of matter not to dwell upon the impossibility of the conception the infinite extension of matter is an idea which if not positively disproved is at least not in any respect warranted by telescopic observation of the starsa point to be explained more fully hereafter and this empirical reason for believing in the original finity of matter is unempirically confirmed for exampleadmitting for the moment the possibility of understanding space filled with the irradiated atomsthat is to say admitting as well as we can for arguments sake that the succession of the irradiated atoms had absolutely no endthen it is abundantly clear that even when the volition of god had been withdrawn from them and thus the tendency to return into unity permitted abstractly to be satisfied this permission would have been nugatory and invalidpractically valueless and of no effect whatever no rëaction could have taken place no movement toward unity could have been made no law of gravity could have obtained  to explaingrant the abstract tendency of any one atom to any one other as the inevitable result of diffusion from the normal unityor what is the same thing admit any given atom as proposing to move in any given directionit is clear that since there is an infinity of atoms on all sides of the atom proposing to move it never can actually move toward the satisfaction of its tendency in the direction given on account of a precisely equal and counterbalancing tendency in the direction diametrically opposite in other words exactly as many tendencies to unity are behind the hesitating atom as before it for it is a mere sotticism to say that one infinite line is longer or shorter than another infinite line or that one infinite number is greater or less than another number that is infinite thus the atom in question must remain stationary forever under the impossible circumstances which we have been merely endeavoring to conceive for arguments sake there could have been no aggregation of matterno starsno worldsnothing but a perpetually atomic and inconsequential universe in fact view it as we will the whole idea of unlimited matter is not only untenable but impossible and preposterous  with the understanding of a sphere of atoms however we perceive at once a satisfiable tendency to union the general result of the tendency each to each being a tendency of all to the centre the general process of condensation or approximation commences immediately by a common and simultaneous movement on withdrawal of the divine volition the individual approximations or coalescencesnot cöalitionsof atom with atom being subject to almost infinite variations of time degree and condition on account of the excessive multiplicity of relation arising from the differences of form assumed as characterizing the atoms at the moment of their quitting the particle proper as well as from the subsequent particular inequidistance each from each  what i wish to impress upon the reader is the certainty of there arising at once on withdrawal of the diffusive force or divine volition out of the condition of the atoms as described at innumerable points throughout the universal sphere innumerable agglomerations characterized by innumerable specific differences of form size essential nature and distance each from each the development of repulsion electricity must have commenced of course with the very earliest particular efforts at unity and must have proceeded constantly in the ratio of coalescencethat is to say in that of condensation or again of heterogeneity  thus the two principles proper attraction and repulsionthe material and the spiritualaccompany each other in the strictest fellowship forever thus the body and the soul walk hand in hand  if now in fancy we select any one of the agglomerations considered as in their primary stages throughout the universal sphere and suppose this incipient agglomeration to be taking place at that point where the centre of our sun existsor rather where it did exist originally for the sun is perpetually shifting his positionwe shall find ourselves met and borne onward for a time at least by the most magnificent of theoriesby the nebular cosmogony of laplacealthough cosmogony is far too comprehensive a term for what he really discusseswhich is the constitution of our solar system aloneof one among the myriad of similar systems which make up the universe properthat universal spherethat allinclusive and absolute kosmos which forms the subject of my present discourse  confining himself to an obviously limited regionthat of our solar system with its comparatively immediate vicinityand merely assumingthat is to say assuming without any basis whatever either deductive or inductivemuch of what i have been just endeavoring to place upon a more stable basis than assumption assuming for example matter as diffused without pretending to account for the diffusion throughout and somewhat beyond the space occupied by our systemdiffused in a state of heterogeneous nebulosity and obedient to that omniprevalent law of gravity at whose principle he ventured to make no guessassuming all this which is quite true although he had no logical right to its assumption laplace has shown dynamically and mathematically that the results in such case necessarily ensuing are those and those alone which we find manifested in the actually existing condition of the system itself  to explainlet us conceive that particular agglomeration of which we have just spokenthe one at the point designated by our suns centreto have so far proceeded that a vast quantity of nebulous matter has here assumed a roughly globular form its centre being of course coincident with what is now or rather was originally the centre of our sun and its periphery extending out beyond the orbit of neptune the most remote of our planetsin other words let us suppose the diameter of this rough sphere to be some  millions of miles for ages this mass of matter has been undergoing condensation until at length it has become reduced into the bulk we imagine having proceeded gradually of course from its atomic and imperceptible state into what we understand of visible palpable or otherwise appreciable nebulosity  now the condition of this mass implies a rotation about an imaginary axisa rotation which commencing with the absolute incipiency of the aggregation has been ever since acquiring velocity the very first two atoms which met approaching each other from points not diametrically opposite would in rushing partially past each other form a nucleus for the rotary movement described how this would increase in velocity is readily seen the two atoms are joined by othersan aggregation is formed the mass continues to rotate while condensing but any atom at the circumference has of course a more rapid motion than one nearer the centre the outer atom however with its superior velocity approaches the centre carrying this superior velocity with it as it goes thus every atom proceeding inwardly and finally attaching itself to the condensed centre adds something to the original velocity of that centrethat is to say increases the rotary movement of the mass  let us now suppose this mass so far condensed that it occupies precisely the space circumscribed by the orbit of neptune and that the velocity with which the surface of the mass moves in the general rotation is precisely that velocity with which neptune now revolves about the sun at this epoch then we are to understand that the constantly increasing centrifugal force having gotten the better of the nonincreasing centripetal loosened and separated the exterior and least condensed stratum or a few of the exterior and least condensed strata at the equator of the sphere where the tangential velocity predominated so that these strata formed about the main body an independent ring encircling the equatorial regionsjust as the exterior portion thrown off by excessive velocity of rotation from a grindstone would form a ring about the grindstone but for the solidity of the superficial material were this caoutchouc or anything similar in consistency precisely the phænomenon i describe would be presented  the ring thus whirled from the nebulous mass revolved of course as a separate ring with just that velocity with which while the surface of the mass it rotated in the meantime condensation still proceeding the interval between the discharged ring and the main body continued to increase until the former was left at a vast distance from the latter  now admitting the ring to have possessed by some seemingly accidental arrangement of its heterogeneous materials a constitution nearly uniform then this ring as such would never have ceased revolving about its primary but as might have been anticipated there appears to have been enough irregularity in the disposition of the materials to make them cluster about centres of superior solidity and thus the annular form was destroyed no doubt the band was soon broken up into several portions and one of these portions predominating in mass absorbed the others into itself the whole settling spherically into a planet that this latter as a planet continued the revolutionary movement which characterized it while a ring is sufficiently clear and that it took upon itself also an additional movement in its new condition of sphere is readily explained the ring being understood as yet unbroken we see that its exterior while the whole revolves about the parent body moves more rapidly than its interior when the rupture occurred then some portion in each fragment must have been moving with greater velocity than the others the superior movement prevailing must have whirled each fragment roundthat is to say have caused it to rotate and the direction of the rotation must of course have been the direction of the revolution whence it arose all the fragments having become subject to the rotation described must in coalescing have imparted it to the one planet constituted by their coalescencethis planet was neptune its material continuing to undergo condensation and the centrifugal force generated in its rotation getting at length the better of the centripetal as before in the case of the parent orb a ring was whirled also from the equatorial surface of this planet this ring having been ununiform in its constitution was broken up and its several fragments being absorbed by the most massive were collectively spherified into a moon subsequently the operation was repeated and a second moon was the result we thus account for the planet neptune with the two satellites which accompany him       laplace assumed his nebulosity heterogeneous merely that     he might be thus enabled to account for the breaking up of the     rings for had the nebulosity been homogeneous they would not     have broken i reach the same resultheterogeneity of the     secondary masses immediately resulting from the atomspurely     from an à priori consideration of their general     designrelation  in throwing off a ring from its equator the sun reestablished that equilibrium between its centripetal and centrifugal forces which had been disturbed in the process of condensation but as this condensation still proceeded the equilibrium was again immediately disturbed through the increase of rotation by the time the mass had so far shrunk that it occupied a spherical space just that circumscribed by the orbit of uranus we are to understand that the centrifugal force had so far obtained the ascendency that new relief was needed a second equatorial band was consequently thrown off which proving ununiform was broken up as before in the case of neptune the fragments settling into the planet uranus the velocity of whose actual revolution about the sun indicates of course the rotary speed of that suns equatorial surface at the moment of the separation uranus adopting a rotation from the collective rotations of the fragments composing it as previously explained now threw off ring after ring each of which becoming broken up settled into a moonthree moons at different epochs having been formed in this manner by the rupture and general spherification of as many distinct ununiform rings  by the time the sun had shrunk until it occupied a space just that circumscribed by the orbit of saturn the balance we are to suppose between its centripetal and centrifugal forces had again become so far disturbed through increase of rotary velocity the result of condensation that a third effort at equilibrium became necessary and an annular band was therefore whirled off as twice before which on rupture through ununiformity became consolidated into the planet saturn this latter threw off in the first place seven uniform bands which on rupture were spherified respectively into as many moons but subsequently it appears to have discharged at three distinct but not very distant epochs three rings whose equability of constitution was by apparent accident so considerable as to present no occasion for their rupture thus they continue to revolve as rings i use the phrase apparent accident for of accident in the ordinary sense there was of course nothingthe term is properly applied only to the result of indistinguishable or not immediately traceable law  shrinking still farther until it occupied just the space circumscribed by the orbit of jupiter the sun now found need of farther effort to restore the counterbalance of its two forces continually disarranged in the still continued increase of rotation jupiter accordingly was now thrown off passing from the annular to the planetary condition and on attaining this latter threw off in its turn at four different epochs four rings which finally resolved themselves into so many moons  still shrinking until its sphere occupied just the space defined by the orbit of the asteroids the sun now discarded a ring which appears to have had eight centres of superior solidity and on breaking up to have separated into eight fragments no one of which so far predominated in mass as to absorb the others all therefore as distinct although comparatively small planets proceeded to revolve in orbits whose distances each from each may be considered as in some degree the measure of the force which drove them asunderall the orbits nevertheless being so closely coincident as to admit of our calling them one in view of the other planetary orbits  continuing to shrink the sun on becoming so small as just to fill the orbit of mars now discharged this planetof course by the process repeatedly described having no moon however mars could have thrown off no ring in fact an epoch had now arrived in the career of the parent body the centre of the system the decrease of its nebulosity which is the increase of its density and which again is the decrease of its condensation out of which latter arose the constant disturbance of equilibriummust by this period have attained a point at which the efforts for restoration would have been more and more ineffectual just in proportion as they were less frequently needed thus the processes of which we have been speaking would everywhere show signs of exhaustionin the planets first and secondly in the original mass we must not fall into the error of supposing the decrease of interval observed among the planets as we approach the sun to be in any respect indicative of an increase of frequency in the periods at which they were discarded exactly the converse is to be understood the longest interval of time must have occurred between the discharges of the two interior the shortest between those of the two exterior planets the decrease of the interval of space is nevertheless the measure of the density and thus inversely of the condensation of the sun throughout the processes detailed  having shrunk however so far as to fill only the orbit of our earth the parent sphere whirled from itself still one other bodythe earthin a condition so nebulous as to admit of this bodys discarding in its turn yet another which is our moonbut here terminated the lunar formations  finally subsiding to the orbits first of venus and then of mercury the sun discarded these two interior planets neither of which has given birth to any moon  thus from his original bulkor to speak more accurately from the condition in which we first considered himfrom a partially spherified nebular mass certainly much more than  millions of miles in diameterthe great central orb and origin of our solarplanetarylunar system has gradually descended by condensation in obedience to the law of gravity to a globe only  miles in diameter but it by no means follows either that its condensation is yet complete or that it may not still possess the capacity of whirling from itself another planet  i have here givenin outline of course but still with all the detail necessary for distinctnessa view of the nebular theory as its author himself conceived it from whatever point we regard it we shall find it beautifully true it is by far too beautiful indeed not to possess truth as its essentialityand here i am very profoundly serious in what i say in the revolution of the satellites of uranus there does appear something seemingly inconsistent with the assumptions of laplace but that one inconsistency can invalidate a theory constructed from a million of intricate consistencies is a fancy fit only for the fantastic in prophecying confidently that the apparent anomaly to which i refer will sooner or later be found one of the strongest possible corroborations of the general hypothesis i pretend to no especial spirit of divination it is a matter which the only difficulty seems not to foresee       i am prepared to show that the anomalous revolution of the     satellites of uranus is a simply perspective anomaly arising     from the inclination of the axis of the planet  the bodies whirled off in the processes described would exchange it has been seen the superficial rotation of the orbs whence they originated for a revolution of equal velocity about these orbs as distant centres and the revolution thus engendered must proceed so long as the centripetal force or that with which the discarded body gravitates toward its parent is neither greater nor less than that by which it was discarded that is than the centrifugal or far more properly than the tangential velocity from the unity however of the origin of these two forces we might have expected to find them as they are foundthe one accurately counterbalancing the other it has been shown indeed that the act of whirlingoff is in every case merely an act for the preservation of the counterbalance  after referring however the centripetal force to the omniprevalent law of gravity it has been the fashion with astronomical treatises to seek beyond the limits of mere naturethat is to say of secondary causea solution of the phænomenon of tangential velocity this latter they attribute directly to a first causeto god the force which carries a stellar body around its primary they assert to have originated in an impulse given immediately by the fingerthis is the childish phraseology employedby the finger of deity itself in this view the planets fully formed are conceived to have been hurled from the divine hand to a position in the vicinity of the suns with an impetus mathematically adapted to the masses or attractive capacities of the suns themselves an idea so grossly unphilosophical although so supinely adopted could have arisen only from the difficulty of otherwise accounting for the absolutely accurate adaptation each to each of two forces so seemingly independent one of the other as are the gravitating and tangential but it should be remembered that for a long time the coincidence between the moons rotation and her sidereal revolutiontwo matters seemingly far more independent than those now consideredwas looked upon as positively miraculous and there was a strong disposition even among astronomers to attribute the marvel to the direct and continual agency of godwho in this case it was said had found it necessary to interpose specially among his general laws a set of subsidiary regulations for the purpose of forever concealing from mortal eyes the glories or perhaps the horrors of the other side of the moonof that mysterious hemisphere which has always avoided and must perpetually avoid the telescopic scrutiny of mankind the advance of science however soon demonstratedwhat to the philosophical instinct needed no demonstrationthat the one movement is but a portionsomething more even than a consequenceof the other  for my part i have no patience with fantasies at once so timorous so idle and so awkward they belong to the veriest cowardice of thought that nature and the god of nature are distinct no thinking being can long doubt by the former we imply merely the laws of the latter but with the very idea of god omnipotent omniscient we entertain also the idea of the infallibility of his laws with him there being neither past nor futurewith him all being nowdo we not insult him in supposing his laws so contrived as not to provide for every possible contingencyor rather what idea can we have of any possible contingency except that it is at once a result and a manifestation of his laws he who divesting himself of prejudice shall have the rare courage to think absolutely for himself cannot fail to arrive in the end at the condensation of laws into lawcannot fail of reaching the conclusion that each law of nature is dependent at all points upon all other laws and that all are but consequences of one primary exercise of the divine volition such is the principle of the cosmogony which with all necessary deference i here venture to suggest and to maintain  in this view it will be seen that dismissing as frivolous and even impious the fancy of the tangential force having been imparted to the planets immediately by the finger of god i consider this force as originating in the rotation of the starsthis rotation as brought about by the inrushing of the primary atoms towards their respective centres of aggregationthis inrushing as the consequence of the law of gravitythis law as but the mode in which is necessarily manifested the tendency of the atoms to return into imparticularitythis tendency to return as but the inevitable rëaction of the first and most sublime of actsthat act by which a god selfexisting and alone existing became all things at once through dint of his volition while all things were thus constituted a portion of god  the radical assumptions of this discourse suggest to me and in fact imply certain important modifications of the nebular theory as given by laplace the efforts of the repulsive power i have considered as made for the purpose of preventing contact among the atoms and thus as made in the ratio of the approach to contactthat is to say in the ratio of condensation in other words electricity with its involute phænomena heat light and magnetism is to be understood as proceeding as condensation proceeds and of course inversely as density proceeds or the cessation to condense thus the sun in the process of its aggregation must soon in developing repulsion have become excessively heatedperhaps incandescent and we can perceive how the operation of discarding its rings must have been materially assisted by the slight incrustation of its surface consequent on cooling any common experiment shows us how readily a crust of the character suggested is separated through heterogeneity from the interior mass but on every successive rejection of the crust the new surface would appear incandescent as before and the period at which it would again become so far encrusted as to be readily loosened and discharged may well be imagined as exactly coincident with that at which a new effort would be needed by the whole mass to restore the equilibrium of its two forces disarranged through condensation in other wordsby the time the electric influence repulsion has prepared the surface for rejection we are to understand that the gravitating influence attraction is precisely ready to reject it here then as everywhere the body and the soul walk hand in hand       see page   these ideas are empirically confirmed at all points since condensation can never in any body be considered as absolutely at an end we are warranted in anticipating that whenever we have an opportunity of testing the matter we shall find indications of resident luminosity in all the stellar bodiesmoons and planets as well as suns that our moon is strongly selfluminous we see at her every total eclipse when if not so she would disappear on the dark part of the satellite too during her phases we often observe flashes like our own auroras and that these latter with our various other socalled electrical phænomena without reference to any more steady radiance must give our earth a certain appearance of luminosity to an inhabitant of the moon is quite evident in fact we should regard all the phænomena referred to as mere manifestations in different moods and degrees of the earths feeblycontinued condensation  if my views are tenable we should be prepared to find the newer planetsthat is to say those nearer the sunmore luminous than those older and more remoteand the extreme brilliancy of venus on whose dark portions during her phases the auroras are frequently visible does not seem to be altogether accounted for by her mere proximity to the central orb she is no doubt vividly selfluminous although less so than mercury while the luminosity of neptune may be comparatively nothing  admitting what i have urged it is clear that from the moment of the suns discarding a ring there must be a continuous diminution both of his heat and light on account of the continuous encrustation of his surface and that a period would arrivethe period immediately previous to a new dischargewhen a very material decrease of both light and heat must become apparent now we know that tokens of such changes are distinctly recognizable on the melville islandsto adduce merely one out of a hundred exampleswe find traces of ultratropical vegetationof plants that never could have flourished without immensely more light and heat than are at present afforded by our sun to any portion of the surface of the earth is such vegetation referable to an epoch immediately subsequent to the whirlingoff of venus at this epoch must have occurred to us our greatest access of solar influence and in fact this influence must then have attained its maximumleaving out of view of course the period when the earth itself was discardedthe period of its mere organization  againwe know that there exist nonluminous sunsthat is to say suns whose existence we determine through the movements of others but whose luminosity is not sufficient to impress us are these suns invisible merely on account of the length of time elapsed since their discharge of a planet and yet againmay we notat least in certain casesaccount for the sudden appearances of suns where none had been previously suspected by the hypothesis that having rolled with encrusted surfaces throughout the few thousand years of our astronomical history each of these suns in whirling off a new secondary has at length been enabled to display the glories of its still incandescent interiorto the wellascertained fact of the proportional increase of heat as we descend into the earth i need of course do nothing more than referit comes in the strongest possible corroboration of all that i have said on the topic now at issue  in speaking not long ago of the repulsive or electrical influence i remarked that the important phænomena of vitality consciousness and thought whether we observe them generally or in detail seem to proceed at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous i mentioned too that i would recur to the suggestionand this is the proper point at which to do so looking at the matter first in detail we perceive that not merely the manifestation of vitality but its importance consequence and elevation of character keep pace very closely with the heterogeneity or complexity of the animal structure looking at the question now in its generality and referring to the first movements of the atoms towards massconstitution we find that heterogeneousness brought about directly through condensation is proportional with it forever we thus reach the proposition that the importance of the development of the terrestrial vitality proceeds equably with the terrestrial condensation       page   now this is in precise accordance with what we know of the succession of animals on the earth as it has proceeded in its condensation superior and still superior races have appeared is it impossible that the successive geological revolutions which have attended at least if not immediately caused these successive elevations of vitalic characteris it improbable that these revolutions have themselves been produced by the successive planetary discharges from the sunin other words by the successive variations in the solar influence on the earth were this idea tenable we should not be unwarranted in the fancy that the discharge of yet a new planet interior to mercury may give rise to yet a new modification of the terrestrial surfacea modification from which may spring a race both materially and spiritually superior to man these thoughts impress me with all the force of truthbut i throw them out of course merely in their obvious character of suggestion  the nebular theory of laplace has lately received far more confirmation than it needed at the hands of the philosopher compte these two have thus together shownnot to be sure that matter at any period actually existed as described in a state of nebular diffusion but that admitting it so to have existed throughout the space and much beyond the space now occupied by our solar system and to have commenced a movement towards a centreit must gradually have assumed the various forms and motions which are now seen in that system to obtain a demonstration such as thisa dynamical and mathematical demonstration as far as demonstration can beunquestionable and unquestionedunless indeed by that unprofitable and disreputable tribe the professional questionersthe mere madmen who deny the newtonian law of gravity on which the results of the french mathematicians are baseda demonstration i say such as this would to most intellects be conclusiveand i confess that it is so to mineof the validity of the nebular hypothesis upon which the demonstration depends  that the demonstration does not prove the hypothesis according to the common understanding of the word proof i admit of course to show that certain existing resultsthat certain established factsmay be even mathematically accounted for by the assumption of a certain hypothesis is by no means to establish the hypothesis itself in other wordsto show that certain data being given a certain existing result might or even must have ensued will fail to prove that this result did ensue from the data until such time as it shall be also shown that there are and can be no other data from which the result in question might equally have ensued but in the case now discussed although all must admit the deficiency of what we are in the habit of terming proof still there are many intellects and those of the loftiest order to which no proof could bring one iota of additional conviction without going into details which might impinge upon the cloudland of metaphysics i may as well here observe that the force of conviction in cases such as this will always with the rightthinking be proportional to the amount of complexity intervening between the hypothesis and the result to be less abstractthe greatness of the complexity found existing among cosmical conditions by rendering great in the same proportion the difficulty of accounting for all these conditions at once strengthens also in the same proportion our faith in that hypothesis which does in such manner satisfactorily account for themand as no complexity can well be conceived greater than that of the astronomical conditions so no conviction can be strongerto my mind at leastthan that with which i am impressed by an hypothesis that not only reconciles these conditions with mathematical accuracy and reduces them into a consistent and intelligible whole but is at the same time the sole hypothesis by means of which the human intellect has been ever enabled to account for them at all  a most unfounded opinion has become latterly current in gossiping and even in scientific circlesthe opinion that the socalled nebular cosmogony has been overthrown this fancy has arisen from the report of late observations made among what hitherto have been termed the nebulæ through the large telescope of cincinnati and the worldrenowned instrument of lord rosse certain spots in the firmament which presented even to the most powerful of the old telescopes the appearance of nebulosity or haze had been regarded for a long time as confirming the theory of laplace they were looked upon as stars in that very process of condensation which i have been attempting to describe thus it was supposed that we had ocular evidencean evidence by the way which has always been found very questionableof the truth of the hypothesis and although certain telescopic improvements every now and then enabled us to perceive that a spot here and there which we had been classing among the nebulæ was in fact but a cluster of stars deriving its nebular character only from its immensity of distancestill it was thought that no doubt could exist as to the actual nebulosity of numerous other masses the strongholds of the nebulists bidding defiance to every effort at segregation of these latter the most interesting was the great nebulæ in the constellation orionbut this with innumerable other miscalled nebulæ when viewed through the magnificent modern telescopes has become resolved into a simple collection of stars now this fact has been very generally understood as conclusive against the nebular hypothesis of laplace and on announcement of the discoveries in question the most enthusiastic defender and most eloquent popularizer of the theory dr nichol went so far as to admit the necessity of abandoning an idea which had formed the material of his most praiseworthy book       views of the architecture of the heavens a letter     purporting to be from dr nichol to a friend in america went     the rounds of our newspapers about two years ago i think     admitting the necessity to which i refer in a subsequent     lecture however dr n appears in some manner to have gotten     the better of the necessity and does not quite renounce the     theory although he seems to wish that he could sneer at it as     a purely hypothetical one what else was the law of gravity     before the maskelyne experiments and who questioned the law of     gravity even then  many of my readers will no doubt be inclined to say that the result of these new investigations has at least a strong tendency to overthrow the hypothesis while some of them more thoughtful will suggest that although the theory is by no means disproved through the segregation of the particular nebulæ alluded to still a failure to segregate them with such telescopes might well have been understood as a triumphant corroboration of the theoryand this latter class will be surprised perhaps to hear me say that even with them i disagree if the propositions of this discourse have been comprehended it will be seen that in my view a failure to segregate the nebulæ would have tended to the refutation rather than to the confirmation of the nebular hypothesis  let me explainthe newtonian law of gravity we may of course assume as demonstrated this law it will be remembered i have referred to the rëaction of the first divine actto the rëaction of an exercise of the divine volition temporarily overcoming a difficulty this difficulty is that of forcing the normal into the abnormalof impelling that whose originality and therefore whose rightful condition was one to take upon itself the wrongful condition of many it is only by conceiving this difficulty as temporarily overcome that we can comprehend a rëaction there could have been no rëaction had the act been infinitely continued so long as the act lasted no rëaction of course could commence in other words no gravitation could take placefor we have considered the one as but the manifestation of the other but gravitation has taken place therefore the act of creation has ceased and gravitation has long ago taken place therefore the act of creation has long ago ceased we can no more expect then to observe the primary processes of creation and to these primary processes the condition of nebulosity has already been explained to belong  through what we know of the propagation of light we have direct proof that the more remote of the stars have existed under the forms in which we now see them for an inconceivable number of years so far back at least then as the period when these stars underwent condensation must have been the epoch at which the massconstitutive processes began that we may conceive these processes then as still going on in the case of certain nebulæ while in all other cases we find them thoroughly at an end we are forced into assumptions for which we have really no basis whateverwe have to thrust in again upon the revolting reason the blasphemous idea of special interpositionwe have to suppose that in the particular instances of these nebulæ an unerring god found it necessary to introduce certain supplementary regulationscertain improvements of the general lawcertain retouchings and emendations in a word which had the effect of deferring the completion of these individual stars for centuries of centuries beyond the æra during which all the other stellar bodies had time not only to be fully constituted but to grow hoary with an unspeakable old age  of course it will be immediately objected that since the light by which we recognize the nebulæ now must be merely that which left their surfaces a vast number of years ago the processes at present observed or supposed to be observed are in fact not processes now actually going on but the phantoms of processes completed long in the pastjust as i maintain all these massconstitutive processes must have been  to this i reply that neither is the nowobserved condition of the condensed stars their actual condition but a condition completed long in the past so that my argument drawn from the relative condition of the stars and the nebulæ is in no manner disturbed moreover those who maintain the existence of nebulæ do not refer the nebulosity to extreme distance they declare it a real and not merely a perspective nebulosity that we may conceive indeed a nebular mass as visible at all we must conceive it as very near us in comparison with the condensed stars brought into view by the modern telescopes in maintaining the appearances in question then to be really nebulous we maintain their comparative vicinity to our point of view thus their condition as we see them now must be referred to an epoch far less remote than that to which we may refer the nowobserved condition of at least the majority of the starsin a word should astronomy ever demonstrate a nebula in the sense at present intended i should consider the nebular cosmogonynot indeed as corroborated by the demonstrationbut as thereby irretrievably overthrown  by way however of rendering unto cæsar no more than the things that are cæsars let me here remark that the assumption of the hypothesis which led him to so glorious a result seems to have been suggested to laplace in great measure by a misconceptionby the very misconception of which we have just been speakingby the generally prevalent misunderstanding of the character of the nebulæ so misnamed these he supposed to be in reality what their designation implies the fact is this great man had very properly an inferior faith in his own merely perceptive powers in respect therefore to the actual existence of nebulæan existence so confidently maintained by his telescopic contemporarieshe depended less upon what he saw than upon what he heard  it will be seen that the only valid objections to his theory are those made to its hypothesis as suchto what suggested itnot to what it suggests to its propositions rather than to its results his most unwarranted assumption was that of giving the atoms a movement towards a centre in the very face of his evident understanding that these atoms in unlimited succession extended throughout the universal space i have already shown that under such circumstances there could have occurred no movement at all and laplace consequently assumed one on no more philosophical ground than that something of the kind was necessary for the establishment of what he intended to establish  his original idea seems to have been a compound of the true epicurean atoms with the false nebulæ of his contemporaries and thus his theory presents us with the singular anomaly of absolute truth deduced as a mathematical result from a hybrid datum of ancient imagination intertangled with modern inacumen laplaces real strength lay in fact in an almost miraculous mathematical instincton this he relied and in no instance did it fail or deceive himin the case of the nebular cosmogony it led him blindfolded through a labyrinth of error into one of the most luminous and stupendous temples of truth  let us now fancy for the moment that the ring first thrown off by the sunthat is to say the ring whose breakingup constituted neptunedid not in fact break up until the throwingoff of the ring out of which uranus arose that this latter ring again remained perfect until the discharge of that out of which sprang saturn that this latter again remained entire until the discharge of that from which originated jupiterand so on let us imagine in a word that no dissolution occurred among the rings until the final rejection of that which gave birth to mercury we thus paint to the eye of the mind a series of cöexistent concentric circles and looking as well at them as at the processes by which according to laplaces hypothesis they were constructed we perceive at once a very singular analogy with the atomic strata and the process of the original irradiation as i have described it is it impossible that on measuring the forces respectively by which each successive planetary circle was thrown offthat is to say on measuring the successive excesses of rotation over gravitation which occasioned the successive dischargeswe should find the analogy in question more decidedly confirmed is it improbable that we should discover these forces to have variedas in the original radiationproportionally to the squares of the distances  our solar system consisting in chief of one sun with sixteen planets certainly and possibly a few more revolving about it at various distances and attended by seventeen moons assuredly but very probably by several othersis now to be considered as an example of the innumerable agglomerations which proceeded to take place throughout the universal sphere of atoms on withdrawal of the divine volition i mean to say that our solar system is to be understood as affording a generic instance of these agglomerations or more correctly of the ulterior conditions at which they arrived if we keep our attention fixed on the idea of the utmost possible relation as the omnipotent design and on the precautions taken to accomplish it through difference of form among the original atoms and particular inequidistance we shall find it impossible to suppose for a moment that even any two of the incipient agglomerations reached precisely the same result in the end we shall rather be inclined to think that no two stellar bodies in the universewhether suns planets or moonsare particularly while all are generally similar still less then can we imagine any two assemblages of such bodiesany two systemsas having more than a general resemblance our telescopes at this point thoroughly confirm our deductions taking our own solar system then as merely a loose or general type of all we have so far proceeded in our subject as to survey the universe under the aspect of a spherical space throughout which dispersed with merely general equability exist a number of but generally similar systems       it is not impossible that some unlookedfor optical     improvement may disclose to us among innumerable varieties of     systems a luminous sun encircled by luminous and nonluminous     rings within and without and between which revolve luminous     and nonluminous planets attended by moons having moonsand     even these latter again having moons  let us now expanding our conceptions look upon each of these systems as in itself an atom which in fact it is when we consider it as but one of the countless myriads of systems which constitute the universe regarding all then as but colossal atoms each with the same ineradicable tendency to unity which characterizes the actual atoms of which it consistswe enter at once upon a new order of aggregations the smaller systems in the vicinity of a larger one would inevitably be drawn into still closer vicinity a thousand would assemble here a million thereperhaps here again even a billionleaving thus immeasurable vacancies in space and if now it be demanded why in the case of these systemsof these merely titanic atomsi speak simply of an assemblage and not as in the case of the actual atoms of a more or less consolidated agglomerationif it be asked for instance why i do not carry what i suggest to its legitimate conclusion and describe at once these assemblages of systematoms as rushing to consolidation in spheresas each becoming condensed into one magnificent sunmy reply is that μελλοντα ταυταi am but pausing for a moment on the awful threshold of the future for the present calling these assemblages clusters we see them in the incipient stages of their consolidation their absolute consolidation is to come  we have now reached a point from which we behold the universe as a spherical space interspersed unequably with clusters it will be noticed that i here prefer the adverb unequably to the phrase with a merely general equability employed before it is evident in fact that the equability of distribution will diminish in the ratio of the agglomerative processesthat is to say as the things distributed diminish in number thus the increase of inequabilityan increase which must continue until sooner or later an epoch will arrive at which the largest agglomeration will absorb all the othersshould be viewed as simply a corroborative indication of the tendency to one  and here at length it seems proper to inquire whether the ascertained facts of astronomy confirm the general arrangement which i have thus deductively assigned to the heavens thoroughly they do telescopic observation guided by the laws of perspective enables us to understand that the perceptible universe exists as a cluster of clusters irregularly disposed  the clusters of which this universal cluster of clusters consists are merely what we have been in the practice of designating nebulæand of these nebulæ one is of paramount interest to mankind i allude to the galaxy or milky way this interests us first and most obviously on account of its great superiority in apparent size not only to any one other cluster in the firmament but to all the other clusters taken together the largest of these latter occupies a mere point comparatively and is distinctly seen only with the aid of a telescope the galaxy sweeps throughout the heaven and is brilliantly visible to the naked eye but it interests man chiefly although less immediately on account of its being his home the home of the earth on which he exists the home of the sun about which this earth revolves the home of that system of orbs of which the sun is the centre and primarythe earth one of sixteen secondaries or planetsthe moon one of seventeen tertiaries or satellites the galaxy let me repeat is but one of the clusters which i have been describingbut one of the miscalled nebulæ revealed to usby the telescope alone sometimesas faint hazy spots in various quarters of the sky we have no reason to suppose the milky way really more extensive than the least of these nebulæ its vast superiority in size is but an apparent superiority arising from our position in regard to itthat is to say from our position in its midst however strange the assertion may at first appear to those unversed in astronomy still the astronomer himself has no hesitation in asserting that we are in the midst of that inconceivable host of starsof sunsof systemswhich constitute the galaxy moreover not only have wenot only has our sun a right to claim the galaxy as its own especial cluster but with slight reservation it may be said that all the distinctly visible stars of the firmamentall the stars visible to the naked eyehave equally a right to claim it as their own  there has been a great deal of misconception in respect to the shape of the galaxy which in nearly all our astronomical treatises is said to resemble that of a capital y the cluster in question has in reality a certain generalvery general resemblance to the planet saturn with its encompassing triple ring instead of the solid orb of that planet however we must picture to ourselves a lenticular starisland or collection of stars our sun lying excentricallynear the shore of the islandon that side of it which is nearest the constellation of the cross and farthest from that of cassiopeia the surrounding ring where it approaches our position has in it a longitudinal gash which does in fact cause the ring in our vicinity to assume loosely the appearance of a capital y  we must not fall into the error however of conceiving the somewhat indefinite girdle as at all remote comparatively speaking from the also indefinite lenticular cluster which it surrounds and thus for mere purpose of explanation we may speak of our sun as actually situated at that point of the y where its three component lines unite and conceiving this letter to be of a certain solidityof a certain thickness very trivial in comparison with its lengthwe may even speak of our position as in the middle of this thickness fancying ourselves thus placed we shall no longer find difficulty in accounting for the phænomena presentedwhich are perspective altogether when we look upward or downwardthat is to say when we cast our eyes in the direction of the letters thicknesswe look through fewer stars than when we cast them in the direction of its length or along either of the three component lines of course in the former case the stars appear scatteredin the latter crowdedto reverse this explanationan inhabitant of the earth when looking as we commonly express ourselves at the galaxy is then beholding it in some of the directions of its lengthis looking along the lines of the ybut when looking out into the general heaven he turns his eyes from the galaxy he is then surveying it in the direction of the letters thickness and on this account the stars seem to him scattered while in fact they are as close together on an average as in the mass of the cluster no consideration could be better adapted to convey an idea of this clusters stupendous extent  if with a telescope of high spacepenetrating power we carefully inspect the firmament we shall become aware of a belt of clustersof what we have hitherto called nebulæa band of varying breadth stretching from horizon to horizon at right angles to the general course of the milky way this band is the ultimate cluster of clusters this belt is the universe our galaxy is but one and perhaps one of the most inconsiderable of the clusters which go to the constitution of this ultimate universal belt or band the appearance of this cluster of clusters to our eyes as a belt or band is altogether a perspective phænomenon of the same character as that which causes us to behold our own individual and roughlyspherical cluster the galaxy under guise also of a belt traversing the heavens at right angles to the universal one the shape of the allinclusive cluster is of course generally that of each individual cluster which it includes just as the scattered stars which on looking from the galaxy we see in the general sky are in fact but a portion of that galaxy itself and as closely intermingled with it as any of the telescopic points in what seems the densest portion of its massso are the scattered nebulæ which on casting our eyes from the universal belt we perceive at all points of the firmamentso i say are these scattered nebulæ to be understood as only perspectively scattered and as part and parcel of the one supreme and universal sphere  no astronomical fallacy is more untenable and none has been more pertinaciously adhered to than that of the absolute illimitation of the universe of stars the reasons for limitation as i have already assigned them à priori seem to me unanswerable but not to speak of these observation assures us that there is in numerous directions around us certainly if not in all a positive limitor at the very least affords us no basis whatever for thinking otherwise were the succession of stars endless then the background of the sky would present us an uniform luminosity like that displayed by the galaxysince there could be absolutely no point in all that background at which would not exist a star the only mode therefore in which under such a state of affairs we could comprehend the voids which our telescopes find in innumerable directions would be by supposing the distance of the invisible background so immense that no ray from it has yet been able to reach us at all that this may be so who shall venture to deny i maintain simply that we have not even the shadow of a reason for believing that it is so  when speaking of the vulgar propensity to regard all bodies on the earth as tending merely to the earths centre i observed that with certain exceptions to be specified hereafter every body on the earth tended not only to the earths centre but in every conceivable direction besides the exceptions refer to those frequent gaps in the heavens where our utmost scrutiny can detect not only no stellar bodies but no indications of their existencewhere yawning chasms blacker than erebus seem to afford us glimpses through the boundary walls of the universe of stars into the illimitable universe of vacancy beyond now as any body existing on the earth chances to pass either through its own movement or the earths into a line with any one of these voids or cosmical abysses it clearly is no longer attracted in the direction of that void and for the moment consequently is heavier than at any period either after or before independently of the consideration of these voids however and looking only at the generally unequable distribution of the stars we see that the absolute tendency of bodies on the earth to the earths centre is in a state of perpetual variation       page   we comprehend then the insulation of our universe we perceive the isolation of thatof all that which we grasp with the senses we know that there exists one cluster of clustersa collection around which on all sides extend the immeasurable wildernesses of a space to all human perception untenanted but because upon the confines of this universe of stars we are compelled to pause through want of farther evidence from the senses is it right to conclude that in fact there is no material point beyond that which we have thus been permitted to attain have we or have we not an analogical right to the inference that this perceptible universethat this cluster of clustersis but one of a series of clusters of clusters the rest of which are invisible through distancethrough the diffusion of their light being so excessive ere it reaches us as not to produce upon our retinas a lightimpressionor from there being no such emanation as light at all in these unspeakably distant worldsor lastly from the mere interval being so vast that the electric tidings of their presence in space have not yetthrough the lapsing myriads of yearsbeen enabled to traverse that interval  have we any right to inferenceshave we any ground whatever for visions such as these if we have a right to them in any degree we have a right to their infinite extension  the human brain has obviously a leaning to the infinite and fondles the phantom of the idea it seems to long with a passionate fervor for this impossible conception with the hope of intellectually believing it when conceived what is general among the whole race of man of course no individual of that race can be warranted in considering abnormal nevertheless there may be a class of superior intelligences to whom the human bias alluded to may wear all the character of monomania  my question however remains unansweredhave we any right to inferlet us say rather to imaginean interminable succession of the clusters of clusters or of universes more or less similar  i reply that the right in a case such as this depends absolutely upon the hardihood of that imagination which ventures to claim the right let me declare only that as an individual i myself feel impelled to the fancywithout daring to call it morethat there does exist a limitless succession of universes more or less similar to that of which we have cognizanceto that of which alone we shall ever have cognizanceat the very least until the return of our own particular universe into unity if such clusters of clusters exist howeverand they doit is abundantly clear that having had no part in our origin they have no portion in our laws they neither attract us nor we them their materialtheir spirit is not oursis not that which obtains in any part of our universe they could not impress our senses or our souls among them and usconsidering all for the moment collectivelythere are no influences in common each exists apart and independently in the bosom of its proper and particular god  in the conduct of this discourse i am aiming less at physical than at metaphysical order the clearness with which even material phænomena are presented to the understanding depends very little i have long since learned to perceive upon a merely natural and almost altogether upon a moral arrangement if then i seem to step somewhat too discursively from point to point of my topic let me suggest that i do so in the hope of thus the better keeping unbroken that chain of graduated impression by which alone the intellect of man can expect to encompass the grandeurs of which i speak and in their majestic totality to comprehend them  so far our attention has been directed almost exclusively to a general and relative grouping of the stellar bodies in space of specification there has been little and whatever ideas of quantity have been conveyedthat is to say of number magnitude and distancehave been conveyed incidentally and by way of preparation for more definitive conceptions these latter let us now attempt to entertain  our solar system as has been already mentioned consists in chief of one sun and sixteen planets certainly but in all probability a few others revolving around it as a centre and attended by seventeen moons of which we know with possibly several more of which as yet we know nothing these various bodies are not true spheres but oblate spheroidsspheres flattened at the poles of the imaginary axes about which they rotatethe flattening being a consequence of the rotation neither is the sun absolutely the centre of the system for this sun itself with all the planets revolves about a perpetually shifting point of space which is the systems general centre of gravity neither are we to consider the paths through which these different spheroids movethe moons about the planets the planets about the sun or the sun about the common centreas circles in an accurate sense they are in fact ellipsesone of the foci being the point about which the revolution is made an ellipse is a curve returning into itself one of whose diameters is longer than the other in the longer diameter are two points equidistant from the middle of the line and so situated otherwise that if from each of them a straight line be drawn to any one point of the curve the two lines taken together will be equal to the longer diameter itself now let us conceive such an ellipse at one of the points mentioned which are the foci let us fasten an orange by an elastic thread let us connect this orange with a pea and let us place this latter on the circumference of the ellipse let us now move the pea continuously around the orangekeeping always on the circumference of the ellipse the elastic thread which of course varies in length as we move the pea will form what in geometry is called a radius vector now if the orange be understood as the sun and the pea as a planet revolving about it then the revolution should be made at such a ratewith a velocity so varyingthat the radius vector may pass over equal areas of space in equal times the progress of the pea should bein other words the progress of the planet is of courseslow in proportion to its distance from the sunswift in proportion to its proximity those planets moreover move the more slowly which are the farther from the sun the squares of their periods of revolution having the same proportion to each other as have to each other the cubes of their mean distances from the sun  the wonderfully complex laws of revolution here described however are not to be understood as obtaining in our system alone they everywhere prevail where attraction prevails they control the universe every shining speck in the firmament is no doubt a luminous sun resembling our own at least in its general features and having in attendance upon it a greater or less number of planets greater or less whose still lingering luminosity is not sufficient to render them visible to us at so vast a distance but which nevertheless revolve moonattended about their starry centres in obedience to the principles just detailedin obedience to the three omniprevalent laws of revolutionthe three immortal laws guessed by the imaginative kepler and but subsequently demonstrated and accounted for by the patient and mathematical newton among a tribe of philosophers who pride themselves excessively upon matteroffact it is far too fashionable to sneer at all speculation under the comprehensive sobriquet guesswork the point to be considered is who guesses in guessing with plato we spend our time to better purpose now and then than in hearkening to a demonstration by alcmæon  in many works on astronomy i find it distinctly stated that the laws of kepler are the basis of the great principle gravitation this idea must have arisen from the fact that the suggestion of these laws by kepler and his proving them à posteriori to have an actual existence led newton to account for them by the hypothesis of gravitation and finally to demonstrate them à priori as necessary consequences of the hypothetical principle thus so far from the laws of kepler being the basis of gravity gravity is the basis of these lawsas it is indeed of all the laws of the material universe which are not referable to repulsion alone  the mean distance of the earth from the moonthat is to say from the heavenly body in our closest vicinityis  miles mercury the planet nearest the sun is distant from him  millions of miles venus the next revolves at a distance of  millionsthe earth which comes next at a distance of  millionsmars then at a distance of  millions now come the eight asteroids ceres juno vesta pallas astræa flora iris and hebe at an average distance of about  millions then we have jupiter distant  millions then saturn  millions then uranus  hundred millions finally neptune lately discovered and revolving at a distance say of  hundred millions leaving neptune out of the accountof which as yet we know little accurately and which is possibly one of a system of asteroidsit will be seen that within certain limits there exists an order of interval among the planets speaking loosely we may say that each outer planet is twice as far from the sun as is the next inner one may not the order here mentionedmay not the law of bodebe deduced from consideration of the analogy suggested by me as having place between the solar discharge of rings and the mode of the atomic irradiation  the numbers hurriedly mentioned in this summary of distance it is folly to attempt comprehending unless in the light of abstract arithmetical facts they are not practically tangible ones they convey no precise ideas i have stated that neptune the planet farthest from the sun revolves about him at a distance of  hundred millions of miles so far goodi have stated a mathematical fact and without comprehending it in the least we may put it to usemathematically but in mentioning even that the moon revolves about the earth at the comparatively trifling distance of  miles i entertained no expectation of giving any one to understandto knowto feelhow far from the earth the moon actually is  miles there are perhaps few of my readers who have not crossed the atlantic ocean yet how many of them have a distinct idea of even the  miles intervening between shore and shore i doubt indeed whether the man lives who can force into his brain the most remote conception of the interval between one milestone and its next neighbor upon the turnpike we are in some measure aided however in our consideration of distance by combining this consideration with the kindred one of velocity sound passes through  feet of space in a second of time now were it possible for an inhabitant of the earth to see the flash of a cannon discharged in the moon and to hear the report he would have to wait after perceiving the former more than  entire days and nights before getting any intimation of the latter  however feeble be the impression even thus conveyed of the moons real distance from the earth it will nevertheless effect a good object in enabling us more clearly to see the futility of attempting to grasp such intervals as that of the  hundred millions of miles between our sun and neptune or even that of the  millions between the sun and the earth we inhabit a cannonball flying at the greatest velocity with which such a ball has ever been known to fly could not traverse the latter interval in less than  years while for the former it would require   our moons real diameter is  miles yet she is comparatively so trifling an object that it would take nearly  such orbs to compose one as great as the earth  the diameter of our own globe is  milesbut from the enunciation of these numbers what positive idea do we derive  if we ascend an ordinary mountain and look around us from its summit we behold a landscape stretching say  miles in every direction forming a circle  miles in circumference and including an area of  square miles the extent of such a prospect on account of the successiveness with which its portions necessarily present themselves to view can be only very feebly and very partially appreciatedyet the entire panorama would comprehend no more than one th part of the mere surface of our globe were this panorama then to be succeeded after the lapse of an hour by another of equal extent this again by a third after the lapse of another hour this again by a fourth after lapse of another hourand so on until the scenery of the whole earth were exhausted and were we to be engaged in examining these various panoramas for twelve hours of every day we should nevertheless be  years and  days in completing the general survey  but if the mere surface of the earth eludes the grasp of the imagination what are we to think of its cubical contents it embraces a mass of matter equal in weight to at least  sextillions  quintillions of tons let us suppose it in a state of quiescence and now let us endeavor to conceive a mechanical force sufficient to set it in motion not the strength of all the myriads of beings whom we may conclude to inhabit the planetary worlds of our systemnot the combined physical strength of all these beingseven admitting all to be more powerful than manwould avail to stir the ponderous mass a single inch from its position  what are we to understand then of the force which under similar circumstances would be required to move the largest of our planets jupiter this is  miles in diameter and would include within its periphery more than a thousand orbs of the magnitude of our own yet this stupendous body is actually flying around the sun at the rate of  miles an hourthat is to say with a velocity  times greater than that of a cannonball the thought of such a phænomenon cannot well be said to startle the mindit palsies and appals it not unfrequently we task our imagination in picturing the capacities of an angel let us fancy such a being at a distance of some hundred miles from jupitera close eyewitness of this planet as it speeds on its annual revolution now can we i demand fashion for ourselves any conception so distinct of this ideal beings spiritual exaltation as that involved in the supposition that even by this immeasurable mass of matter whirled immediately before his eyes with a velocity so unutterable hean angelangelic though he beis not at once struck into nothingness and overwhelmed  at this point however it seems proper to suggest that in fact we have been speaking of comparative trifles our sun the central and controlling orb of the system to which jupiter belongs is not only greater than jupiter but greater by far than all the planets of the system taken together this fact is an essential condition indeed of the stability of the system itself the diameter of jupiter has been mentionedit is  milesthat of the sun is  miles an inhabitant of the latter travelling  miles a day would be more than  years in going round a great circle of its circumference it occupies a cubical space of  quadrillions  trillions of miles the moon as has been stated revolves about the earth at a distance of  milesin an orbit consequently of nearly a million and a half now were the sun placed upon the earth centre over centre the body of the former would extend in every direction not only to the line of the moons orbit but beyond it a distance of  miles  and here once again let me suggest that in fact we have still been speaking of comparative trifles the distance of the planet neptune from the sun has been statedit is  hundred millions of miles the circumference of its orbit therefore is about  billions let this be borne in mind while we glance at some one of the brightest stars between this and the star of our system the sun there is a gulf of space to convey any idea of which we should need the tongue of an archangel from our system then and from our sun or star the star at which we suppose ourselves glancing is a thing altogether apartstill for the moment let us imagine it placed upon our sun centre over centre as we just now imagined this sun itself placed upon the earth let us now conceive the particular star we have in mind extending in every direction beyond the orbit of mercuryof venusof the earthstill on beyond the orbit of marsof jupiterof uranusuntil finally we fancy it filling the circle billions of miles in circumferencewhich is described by the revolution of leverriers planet when we have conceived all this we shall have entertained no extravagant conception there is the very best reason for believing that many of the stars are even far larger than the one we have imagined i mean to say that we have the very best empirical basis for such beliefand in looking back at the original atomic arrangements for diversity which have been assumed as a part of the divine plan in the constitution of the universe we shall be enabled easily to understand and to credit the existence of even far vaster disproportions in stellar size than any to which i have hitherto alluded the largest orbs of course we must expect to find rolling through the widest vacancies of space  i remarked just now that to convey an idea of the interval between our sun and any one of the other stars we should require the eloquence of an archangel in so saying i should not be accused of exaggeration for in simple truth these are topics on which it is scarcely possible to exaggerate but let us bring the matter more distinctly before the eye of the mind  in the first place we may get a general relative conception of the interval referred to by comparing it with the interplanetary spaces if for example we suppose the earth which is in reality  millions of miles from the sun to be only one foot from that luminary then neptune would be  feet distant and the star alpha lyræ at the very least   now i presume that in the termination of my last sentence few of my readers have noticed anything especially objectionableparticularly wrong i said that the distance of the earth from the sun being taken at one foot the distance of neptune would be  feet and that of alpha lyræ  the proportion between one foot and  has appeared perhaps to convey a sufficiently definite impression of the proportion between the two intervalsthat of the earth from the sun and that of alpha lyræ from the same luminary but my account of the matter should in reality have run thusthe distance of the earth from the sun being taken at one foot the distance of neptune would be  feet and that of alpha lyræ milesthat is to say i had assigned to alpha lyræ in my first statement of the case only the th part of that distance which is the least distance possible at which it can actually lie  to proceedhowever distant a mere planet is yet when we look at it through a telescope we see it under a certain formof a certain appreciable size now i have already hinted at the probable bulk of many of the stars nevertheless when we view any one of them even through the most powerful telescope it is found to present us with no form and consequently with no magnitude whatever we see it as a point and nothing more  againlet us suppose ourselves walking at night on a highway in a field on one side of the road is a line of tall objects say trees the figures of which are distinctly defined against the background of the sky this line of objects extends at right angles to the road and from the road to the horizon now as we proceed along the road we see these objects changing their positions respectively in relation to a certain fixed point in that portion of the firmament which forms the background of the view let us suppose this fixed pointsufficiently fixed for our purposeto be the rising moon we become aware at once that while the tree nearest us so far alters its position in respect to the moon as to seem flying behind us the tree in the extreme distance has scarcely changed at all its relative position with the satellite we then go on to perceive that the farther the objects are from us the less they alter their positions and the converse then we begin unwittingly to estimate the distances of individual trees by the degrees in which they evince the relative alteration finally we come to understand how it might be possible to ascertain the actual distance of any given tree in the line by using the amount of relative alteration as a basis in a simple geometrical problem now this relative alteration is what we call parallax and by parallax we calculate the distances of the heavenly bodies applying the principle to the trees in question we should of course be very much at a loss to comprehend the distance of that tree which however far we proceeded along the road should evince no parallax at all this in the case described is a thing impossible but impossible only because all distances on our earth are trivial indeedin comparison with the vast cosmical quantities we may speak of them as absolutely nothing  now let us suppose the star alpha lyræ directly overhead and let us imagine that instead of standing on the earth we stand at one end of a straight road stretching through space to a distance equalling the diameter of the earths orbitthat is to say to a distance of  millions of miles having observed by means of the most delicate micrometrical instruments the exact position of the star let us now pass along this inconceivable road until we reach its other extremity now once again let us look at the star it is precisely where we left it our instruments however delicate assure us that its relative position is absolutelyis identically the same as at the commencement of our unutterable journey no parallaxnone whateverhas been found  the fact is that in regard to the distance of the fixed starsof any one of the myriads of suns glistening on the farther side of that awful chasm which separates our system from its brothers in the cluster to which it belongsastronomical science until very lately could speak only with a negative certainty assuming the brightest as the nearest we could say even of them only that there is a certain incomprehensible distance on the hither side of which they cannot behow far they are beyond it we had in no case been able to ascertain we perceived for example that alpha lyræ cannot be nearer to us than  trillions  billions of miles but for all we knew and indeed for all we now know it may be distant from us the square or the cube or any other power of the number mentioned by dint however of wonderfully minute and cautious observations continued with novel instruments for many laborious years bessel not long ago deceased has lately succeeded in determining the distance of six or seven stars among others that of the star numbered  in the constellation of the swan the distance in this latter instance ascertained is  times that of the sun which last it will be remembered is  millions of miles the star  cygni then is nearly  trillions of miles from usor more than three times the distance assigned as the least possible for alpha lyræ  in attempting to appreciate this interval by the aid of any considerations of velocity as we did in endeavoring to estimate the distance of the moon we must leave out of sight altogether such nothings as the speed of a cannonball or of sound light however according to the latest calculations of struve proceeds at the rate of  miles in a second thought itself cannot pass through this interval more speedilyif indeed thought can traverse it at all yet in coming from  cygni to us even at this inconceivable rate light occupies more than ten years and consequently were the star this moment blotted out from the universe still for ten years would it continue to sparkle on undimmed in its paradoxical glory  keeping now in mind whatever feeble conception we may have attained of the interval between our sun and  cygni let us remember that this interval however unutterably vast we are permitted to consider as but the average interval among the countless host of stars composing that cluster or nebula to which our system as well as that of  cygni belongs i have in fact stated the case with great moderationwe have excellent reason for believing  cygni to be one of the nearest stars and thus for concluding at least for the present that its distance from us is less than the average distance between star and star in the magnificent cluster of the milky way  and here once again and finally it seems proper to suggest that even as yet we have been speaking of trifles ceasing to wonder at the space between star and star in our own or in any particular cluster let us rather turn our thoughts to the intervals between cluster and cluster in the all comprehensive cluster of the universe  i have already said that light proceeds at the rate of  miles in a secondthat is about  millions of miles in a minute or about  millions of miles in an houryet so far removed from us are some of the nebulæ that even light speeding with this velocity could not and does not reach us from those mysterious regions in less than  millions of years this calculation moreover is made by the elder herschell and in reference merely to those comparatively proximate clusters within the scope of his own telescope there are nebulæ however which through the magical tube of lord rosse are this instant whispering in our ears the secrets of a million of ages bygone in a word the events which we behold nowat this momentin those worldsare the identical events which interested their inhabitants ten hundred thousand centuries ago in intervalsin distances such as this suggestion forces upon the soulrather than upon the mindwe find at length a fitting climax to all hitherto frivolous considerations of quantity  our fancies thus occupied with the cosmical distances let us take the opportunity of referring to the difficulty which we have so often experienced while pursuing the beaten path of astronomical reflection in accounting for the immeasurable voids alluded toin comprehending why chasms so totally unoccupied and therefore apparently so needless have been made to intervene between star and starbetween cluster and clusterin understanding to be brief a sufficient reason for the titanic scale in respect of mere space on which the universe is seen to be constructed a rational cause for the phænomenon i maintain that astronomy has palpably failed to assignbut the considerations through which in this essay we have proceeded step by step enable us clearly and immediately to perceive that space and duration are one that the universe might endure throughout an æra at all commensurate with the grandeur of its component material portions and with the high majesty of its spiritual purposes it was necessary that the original atomic diffusion be made to so inconceivable an extent as to be only not infinite it was required in a word that the stars should be gathered into visibility from invisible nebulosityproceed from nebulosity to consolidationand so grow grey in giving birth and death to unspeakably numerous and complex variations of vitalic developmentit was required that the stars should do all thisshould have time thoroughly to accomplish all these divine purposesduring the period in which all things were effecting their return into unity with a velocity accumulating in the inverse proportion of the squares of the distances at which lay the inevitable end  throughout all this we have no difficulty in understanding the absolute accuracy of the divine adaptation the density of the stars respectively proceeds of course as their condensation diminishes condensation and heterogeneity keep pace with each other through the latter which is the index of the former we estimate the vitalic and spiritual development thus in the density of the globes we have the measure in which their purposes are fulfilled as density proceedsas the divine intentions are accomplishedas less and still less remains to be accomplishedsoin the same ratioshould we expect to find an acceleration of the endand thus the philosophical mind will easily comprehend that the divine designs in constituting the stars advance mathematically to their fulfilmentand more it will readily give the advance a mathematical expression it will decide that this advance is inversely proportional with the squares of the distances of all created things from the startingpoint and goal of their creation  not only is this divine adaptation however mathematically accurate but there is that about it which stamps it as divine in distinction from that which is merely the work of human constructiveness i allude to the complete mutuality of adaptation for example in human constructions a particular cause has a particular effect a particular intention brings to pass a particular object but this is all we see no reciprocity the effect does not react upon the cause the intention does not change relations with the object in divine constructions the object is either design or object as we choose to regard itand we may take at any time a cause for an effect or the converseso that we can never absolutely decide which is which  to give an instancein polar climates the human frame to maintain its animal heat requires for combustion in the capillary system an abundant supply of highly azotized food such as trainoil but againin polar climates nearly the sole food afforded man is the oil of abundant seals and whales now whether is oil at hand because imperatively demanded or the only thing demanded because the only thing to be obtained it is impossible to decide there is an absolute reciprocity of adaptation  the pleasure which we derive from any display of human ingenuity is in the ratio of the approach to this species of reciprocity in the construction of plot for example in fictitious literature we should aim at so arranging the incidents that we shall not be able to determine of any one of them whether it depends from any one other or upholds it in this sense of course perfection of plot is really or practically unattainablebut only because it is a finite intelligence that constructs the plots of god are perfect the universe is a plot of god  and now we have reached a point at which the intellect is forced again to struggle against its propensity for analogical inferenceagainst its monomaniac grasping at the infinite moons have been seen revolving about planets planets about stars and the poetical instinct of humanityits instinct of the symmetrical if the symmetry be but a symmetry of surfacethis instinct which the soul not only of man but of all created beings took up in the beginning from the geometrical basis of the universal irradiationimpels us to the fancy of an endless extension of this system of cycles closing our eyes equally to deduction and induction we insist upon imagining a revolution of all the orbs of the galaxy about some gigantic globe which we take to be the central pivot of the whole each cluster in the great cluster of clusters is imagined of course to be similarly supplied and constructed while that the analogy may be wanting at no point we go on to conceive these clusters themselves again as revolving about some still more august spherethis latter still again with its encircling clusters as but one of a yet more magnificent series of agglomerations gyrating about yet another orb central to themsome orb still more unspeakably sublimesome orb let us rather say of infinite sublimity endlessly multiplied by the infinitely sublime such are the conditions continued in perpetuity which the voice of what some people term analogy calls upon the fancy to depict and the reason to contemplate if possible without becoming dissatisfied with the picture such in general are the interminable gyrations beyond gyration which we have been instructed by philosophy to comprehend and to account for at least in the best manner we can now and then however a philosopher properone whose phrenzy takes a very determinate turnwhose genius to speak more reverentially has a stronglypronounced washerwomanish bias doing every thing up by the dozenenables us to see precisely that point out of sight at which the revolutionary processes in question do and of right ought to come to an end  it is hardly worth while perhaps even to sneer at the reveries of fourrierbut much has been said latterly of the hypothesis of mädlerthat there exists in the centre of the galaxy a stupendous globe about which all the systems of the cluster revolve the period of our own indeed has been stated millions of years  that our sun has a motion in space independently of its rotation and revolution about the systems centre of gravity has long been suspected this motion granting it to exist would be manifested perspectively the stars in that firmamental region which we were leaving behind us would in a very long series of years become crowded those in the opposite quarter scattered now by means of astronomical history we ascertain cloudily that some such phænomena have occurred on this ground it has been declared that our system is moving to a point in the heavens diametrically opposite the star zeta herculisbut this inference is perhaps the maximum to which we have any logical right mädler however has gone so far as to designate a particular star alcyone in the pleiades as being at or about the very spot around which a general revolution is performed  now since by analogy we are led in the first instance to these dreams it is no more than proper that we should abide by analogy at least in some measure during their development and that analogy which suggests the revolution suggests at the same time a central orb about which it should be performedso far the astronomer was consistent this central orb however should dynamically be greater than all the orbs taken together which surround it of these there are about  millions why then it was of course demanded do we not see this vast central sunat least equal in mass to  millions of such suns as ourswhy do we not see itwe especially who occupy the mid region of the clusterthe very locality near which at all events must be situated this incomparable star the reply was readyit must be nonluminous as are our planets here then to suit a purpose analogy is suddenly let fall not so it may be saidwe know that nonluminous suns actually exist it is true that we have reason at least for supposing so but we have certainly no reason whatever for supposing that the nonluminous suns in question are encircled by luminous suns while these again are surrounded by nonluminous planetsand it is precisely all this with which mädler is called upon to find any thing analogous in the heavensfor it is precisely all this which he imagines in the case of the galaxy admitting the thing to be so we cannot help here picturing to ourselves how sad a puzzle the why it is so must prove to all à priori philosophers  but granting in the very teeth of analogy and of every thing else the nonluminosity of the vast central orb we may still inquire how this orb so enormous could fail of being rendered visible by the flood of light thrown upon it from the  millions of glorious suns glaring in all directions about it upon the urging of this question the idea of an actually solid central sun appears in some measure to have been abandoned and speculation proceeded to assert that the systems of the cluster perform their revolutions merely about an immaterial centre of gravity common to all here again then to suit a purpose analogy is let fall the planets of our system revolve it is true about a common centre of gravity but they do this in connexion with and in consequence of a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the rest of the system  the mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight lines but this idea of the circlean idea which in view of all ordinary geometry is merely the mathematical as contradistinguished from the practical ideais in sober fact the practical conception which alone we have any right to entertain in regard to the majestic circle with which we have to deal at least in fancy when we suppose our system revolving about a point in the centre of the galaxy let the most vigorous of human imaginations attempt but to take a single step towards the comprehension of a sweep so ineffable it would scarcely be paradoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself travelling forever upon the circumference of this unutterable circle would still forever be travelling in a straight line that the path of our sun in such an orbit would to any human perception deviate in the slightest degree from a straight line even in a million of years is a proposition not to be entertainedyet we are required to believe that a curvature has become apparent during the brief period of our astronomical historyduring a mere pointduring the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years  it may be said that mädler has really ascertained a curvature in the direction of our systems now wellestablished progress through space admitting if necessary this fact to be in reality such i maintain that nothing is thereby shown except the reality of this factthe fact of a curvature for its thorough determination ages will be required and when determined it will be found indicative of some binary or other multiple relation between our sun and some one or more of the proximate stars i hazard nothing however in predicting that after the lapse of many centuries all efforts at determining the path of our sun through space will be abandoned as fruitless this is easily conceivable when we look at the infinity of perturbation it must experience from its perpetuallyshifting relations with other orbs in the common approach of all to the nucleus of the galaxy  but in examining other nebulæ than that of the milky wayin surveying generally the clusters which overspread the heavensdo we or do we not find confirmation of mädlers hypothesis we do not the forms of the clusters are exceedingly diverse when casually viewed but on close inspection through powerful telescopes we recognize the sphere very distinctly as at least the proximate form of alltheir constitution in general being at variance with the idea of revolution about a common centre  it is difficult says sir john herschell to form any conception of the dynamical state of such systems on one hand without a rotary motion and a centrifugal force it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of progressive collapse on the other granting such a motion and such a force we find it no less difficult to reconcile their forms with the rotation of the whole system meaning cluster around any single axis without which internal collision would appear to be inevitable  some remarks lately made about the nebulæ by dr nichol in taking quite a different view of the cosmical conditions from any taken in this discoursehave a very peculiar applicability to the point now at issue he says  when our greatest telescopes are brought to bear upon them we find that those which were thought to be irregular are not so they approach nearer to a globe here is one that looked oval but lord rosses telescope brought it into a circle now there occurs a very remarkable circumstance in reference to these comparatively sweeping circular masses of nebulæ we find they are not entirely circular but the reverse and that all around them on every side there are volumes of stars stretching out apparently as if they were rushing towards a great central mass in consequence of the action of some great power       i must be understood as denying especially only the     revolutionary portion of mädlers hypothesis of course if     no great central orb exists now in our cluster such will     exist hereafter whenever existing it will be merely the     nucleus of the consolidation  were i to describe in my own words what must necessarily be the existing condition of each nebula on the hypothesis that all matter is as i suggest now returning to its original unity i should simply be going over nearly verbatim the language here employed by dr nichol without the faintest suspicion of that stupendous truth which is the key to these nebular phænomena  and here let me fortify my position still farther by the voice of a greater than mädlerof one moreover to whom all the data of mädler have long been familiar things carefully and thoroughly considered referring to the elaborate calculations of argelanderthe very researches which form mädlers basishumboldt whose generalizing powers have never perhaps been equalled has the following observation  when we regard the real proper or nonperspective motions of the stars we find many groups of them moving in opposite directions and the data as yet in hand render it not necessary at least to conceive that the systems composing the milky way or the clusters generally composing the universe are revolving about any particular centre unknown whether luminous or nonluminous it is but mans longing for a fundamental first cause that impels both his intellect and his fancy to the adoption of such an hypothesis       betrachtet man die nicht perspectivischen eigenen     bewegungen der sterne so scheinen viele gruppenweise in ihrer     richtung entgegengesetzt und die bisher gesammelten thatsachen     machen es aufs wenigste nicht nothwendig anzunehmen dass     alle theile unserer sternenschicht oder gar der gesammten     sterneninseln welche den weltraum füllen sich um einen     grossen unbekannten leuchtenden oder dunkeln centralkörper     bewegen das streben nach den letzten und höchsten     grundursachen macht freilich die reflectirende thätigkeit des     menschen wie seine phantasie zu einer solchen annahme     geneigt  the phænomenon here alluded tothat of many groups moving in opposite directionsis quite inexplicable by mädlers idea but arises as a necessary consequence from that which forms the basis of this discourse while the merely general direction of each atomof each moon planet star or clusterwould on my hypothesis be of course absolutely rectilinear while the general path of all bodies would be a right line leading to the centre of all it is clear nevertheless that this general rectilinearity would be compounded of what with scarcely any exaggeration we may term an infinity of particular curvesan infinity of local deviations from rectilinearitythe result of continuous differences of relative position among the multitudinous masses as each proceeded on its own proper journey to the end  i quoted just now from sir john herschell the following words used in reference to the clusterson one hand without a rotary motion and a centrifugal force it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of progressive collapse the fact is that in surveying the nebulæ with a telescope of high power we shall find it quite impossible having once conceived this idea of collapse not to gather at all points corroboration of the idea a nucleus is always apparent in the direction of which the stars seem to be precipitating themselves nor can these nuclei be mistaken for merely perspective phænomenathe clusters are really denser near the centresparser in the regions more remote from it in a word we see every thing as we should see it were a collapse taking place but in general it may be said of these clusters that we can fairly entertain while looking at them the idea of orbitual movement about a centre only by admitting the possible existence in the distant domains of space of dynamical laws with which we are unacquainted  on the part of herschell however there is evidently a reluctance to regard the nebulæ as in a state of progressive collapse but if factsif even appearances justify the supposition of their being in this state why it may well be demanded is he disinclined to admit it simply on account of a prejudicemerely because the supposition is at war with a preconceived and utterly baseless notionthat of the endlessnessthat of the eternal stability of the universe  if the propositions of this discourse are tenable the state of progressive collapse is precisely that state in which alone we are warranted in considering all things and with due humility let me here confess that for my part i am at a loss to conceive how any other understanding of the existing condition of affairs could ever have made its way into the human brain the tendency to collapse and the attraction of gravitation are convertible phrases in using either we speak of the rëaction of the first act never was necessity less obvious than that of supposing matter imbued with an ineradicable quality forming part of its material naturea quality or instinct forever inseparable from it and by dint of which inalienable principle every atom is perpetually impelled to seek its fellowatom never was necessity less obvious than that of entertaining this unphilosophical idea going boldly behind the vulgar thought we have to conceive metaphysically that the gravitating principle appertains to matter temporarilyonly while diffusedonly while existing as many instead of as oneappertains to it by virtue of its state of irradiation aloneappertains in a word altogether to its condition and not in the slightest degree to itself in this view when the irradiation shall have returned into its sourcewhen the rëaction shall be completedthe gravitating principle will no longer exist and in fact astronomers without at any time reaching the idea here suggested seem to have been approximating it in the assertion that if there were but one body in the universe it would be impossible to understand how the principle gravity could obtainthat is to say from a consideration of matter as they find it they reach a conclusion at which i deductively arrive that so pregnant a suggestion as the one just quoted should have been permitted to remain so long unfruitful is nevertheless a mystery which i find it difficult to fathom  it is perhaps in no little degree however our propensity for the continuousfor the analogicalin the present case more particularly for the symmetricalwhich has been leading us astray and in fact the sense of the symmetrical is an instinct which may be depended upon with an almost blindfold reliance it is the poetical essence of the universeof the universe which in the supremeness of its symmetry is but the most sublime of poems now symmetry and consistency are convertible termsthus poetry and truth are one a thing is consistent in the ratio of its truthtrue in the ratio of its consistency a perfect consistency i repeat can be nothing but an absolute truth we may take it for granted then that man cannot long or widely err if he suffer himself to be guided by his poetical which i have maintained to be his truthful in being his symmetrical instinct he must have a care however lest in pursuing too heedlessly the superficial symmetry of forms and motions he leave out of sight the really essential symmetry of the principles which determine and control them  that the stellar bodies would finally be merged in onethat at last all would be drawn into the substance of one stupendous central orb already existingis an idea which for some time past seems vaguely and indeterminately to have held possession of the fancy of mankind it is an idea in fact which belongs to the class of the excessively obvious it springs instantly from a superficial observation of the cyclic and seemingly gyrating or vorticial movements of those individual portions of the universe which come most immediately and most closely under our observation there is not perhaps a human being of ordinary education and of average reflective capacity to whom at some period the fancy in question has not occurred as if spontaneously or intuitively and wearing all the character of a very profound and very original conception this conception however so commonly entertained has never within my knowledge arisen out of any abstract considerations being on the contrary always suggested as i say by the vorticial movements about centres a reason for it alsoa cause for the ingathering of all the orbs into one imagined to be already existing was naturally sought in the same directionamong these cyclic movements themselves  thus it happened that on announcement of the gradual and perfectly regular decrease observed in the orbit of encks comet at every successive revolution about our sun astronomers were nearly unanimous in the opinion that the cause in question was foundthat a principle was discovered sufficient to account physically for that final universal agglomeration which i repeat the analogical symmetrical or poetical instinct of man had predetermined to understand as something more than a simple hypothesis  this causethis sufficient reason for the final ingatheringwas declared to exist in an exceedingly rare but still material medium pervading space which medium by retarding in some degree the progress of the comet perpetually weakened its tangential force thus giving a predominance to the centripetal which of course drew the comet nearer and nearer at each revolution and would eventually precipitate it upon the sun  all this was strictly logicaladmitting the medium or ether but this ether was assumed most illogically on the ground that no other mode than the one spoken of could be discovered of accounting for the observed decrease in the orbit of the cometas if from the fact that we could discover no other mode of accounting for it it followed in any respect that no other mode of accounting for it existed it is clear that innumerable causes might operate in combination to diminish the orbit without even a possibility of our ever becoming acquainted with one of them in the meantime it has never been fairly shown perhaps why the retardation occasioned by the skirts of the suns atmosphere through which the comet passes at perihelion is not enough to account for the phænomenon that encks comet will be absorbed into the sun is probable that all the comets of the system will be absorbed is more than merely possible but in such case the principle of absorption must be referred to eccentricity of orbitto the close approximation to the sun of the comets at their perihelia and is a principle not affecting in any degree the ponderous spheres which are to be regarded as the true material constituents of the universetouching comets in general let me here suggest in passing that we cannot be far wrong in looking upon them as the lightningflashes of the cosmical heaven  the idea of a retarding ether and through it of a final agglomeration of all things seemed at one time however to be confirmed by the observation of a positive decrease in the orbit of the solid moon by reference to eclipses recorded  years ago it was found that the velocity of the satellites revolution then was considerably less than it is now that on the hypothesis that its motions in its orbit is uniformly in accordance with keplers law and was accurately determined then years agoit is now in advance of the position it should occupy by nearly  miles the increase of velocity proved of course a diminution of orbit and astronomers were fast yielding to a belief in an ether as the sole mode of accounting for the phænomenon when lagrange came to the rescue he showed that owing to the configurations of the spheroids the shorter axes of their ellipses are subject to variation in length the longer axes being permanent and that this variation is continuous and vibratoryso that every orbit is in a state of transition either from circle to ellipse or from ellipse to circle in the case of the moon where the shorter axis is decreasing the orbit is passing from circle to ellipse and consequently is decreasing too but after a long series of ages the ultimate eccentricity will be attained then the shorter axis will proceed to increase until the orbit becomes a circle when the process of shortening will again take placeand so on forever in the case of the earth the orbit is passing from ellipse to circle the facts thus demonstrated do away of course with all necessity for supposing an ether and with all apprehension of the systems instabilityon the ethers account  it will be remembered that i have myself assumed what we may term an ether i have spoken of a subtle influence which we know to be ever in attendance upon matter although becoming manifest only through matters heterogeneity to this influencewithout daring to touch it at all in any effort at explaining its awful naturei have referred the various phænomena of electricity heat light magnetism and moreof vitality consciousness and thoughtin a word of spirituality it will be seen at once then that the ether thus conceived is radically distinct from the ether of the astronomers inasmuch as theirs is matter and mine not  with the idea of a material ether seems thus to have departed altogether the thought of that universal agglomeration so long predetermined by the poetical fancy of mankindan agglomeration in which a sound philosophy might have been warranted in putting faith at least to a certain extent if for no other reason than that by this poetical fancy it had been so predetermined but so far as astronomyso far as mere physics have yet spoken the cycles of the universe are perpetualthe universe has no conceivable end had an end been demonstrated however from so purely collateral a cause as an ether mans instinct of the divine capacity to adapt would have rebelled against the demonstration we should have been forced to regard the universe with some such sense of dissatisfaction as we experience in contemplating an unnecessarily complex work of human art creation would have affected us as an imperfect plot in a romance where the dénoûment is awkwardly brought about by interposed incidents external and foreign to the main subject instead of springing out of the bosom of the thesisout of the heart of the ruling ideainstead of arising as a result of the primary propositionas inseparable and inevitable part and parcel of the fundamental conception of the book  what i mean by the symmetry of mere surface will now be more clearly understood it is simply by the blandishment of this symmetry that we have been beguiled into the general idea of which mädlers hypothesis is but a partthe idea of the vorticial indrawing of the orbs dismissing this nakedly physical conception the symmetry of principle sees the end of all things metaphysically involved in the thought of a beginning seeks and finds in this origin of all things the rudiment of this end and perceives the impiety of supposing this end likely to be brought about less simplyless directlyless obviouslyless artisticallythan through the rëaction of the originating act  recurring then to a previous suggestion let us understand the systemslet us understand each star with its attendant planetsas but a titanic atom existing in space with precisely the same inclination for unity which characterized in the beginning the actual atoms after their irradiation throughout the universal sphere as these original atoms rushed towards each other in generally straight lines so let us conceive as at least generally rectilinear the paths of the systematoms towards their respective centres of aggregationand in this direct drawing together of the systems into clusters with a similar and simultaneous drawing together of the clusters themselves while undergoing consolidation we have at length attained the great nowthe awful presentthe existing condition of the universe  of the still more awful future a not irrational analogy may guide us in framing an hypothesis the equilibrium between the centripetal and centrifugal forces of each system being necessarily destroyed upon attainment of a certain proximity to the nucleus of the cluster to which it belongs there must occur at once a chaotic or seemingly chaotic precipitation of the moons upon the planets of the planets upon the suns and of the suns upon the nuclei and the general result of this precipitation must be the gathering of the myriad nowexisting stars of the firmament into an almost infinitely less number of almost infinitely superior spheres in being immeasurably fewer the worlds of that day will be immeasurably greater than our own then indeed amid unfathomable abysses will be glaring unimaginable suns but all this will be merely a climacic magnificence foreboding the great end of this end the new genesis described can be but a very partial postponement while undergoing consolidation the clusters themselves with a speed prodigiously accumulative have been rushing towards their own general centreand now with a thousandfold electric velocity commensurate only with their material grandeur and with the spiritual passion of their appetite for oneness the majestic remnants of the tribe of stars flash at length into a common embrace the inevitable catastrophe is at hand  but this catastrophewhat is it we have seen accomplished the ingathering of the orbs henceforward are we not to understand one material globe of globes as constituting and comprehending the universe such a fancy would be altogether at war with every assumption and consideration of this discourse  i have already alluded to that absolute reciprocity of adaptation which is the idiosyncrasy of the divine artstamping it divine up to this point of our reflections we have been regarding the electrical influence as a something by dint of whose repulsion alone matter is enabled to exist in that state of diffusion demanded for the fulfilment of its purposesso far in a word we have been considering the influence in question as ordained for matters saketo subserve the objects of matter with a perfectly legitimate reciprocity we are now permitted to look at matter as created solely for the sake of this influencesolely to serve the objects of this spiritual ether through the aidby the meansthrough the agency of matter and by dint of its heterogeneityis this ether manifestedis spirit individualized it is merely in the development of this ether through heterogeneity that particular masses of matter become animatesensitiveand in the ratio of their heterogeneitysome reaching a degree of sensitiveness involving what we call thought and thus attaining conscious intelligence  in this view we are enabled to perceive matter as a meansnot as an end its purposes are thus seen to have been comprehended in its diffusion and with the return into unity these purposes cease the absolutely consolidated globe of globes would be objectlesstherefore not for a moment could it continue to exist matter created for an end would unquestionably on fulfilment of that end be matter no longer let us endeavor to understand that it would disappear and that god would remain all in all  that every work of divine conception must cöexist and cöexpire with its particular design seems to me especially obvious and i make no doubt that on perceiving the final globe of globes to be objectless the majority of my readers will be satisfied with my therefore it cannot continue to exist nevertheless as the startling thought of its instantaneous disappearance is one which the most powerful intellect cannot be expected readily to entertain on grounds so decidedly abstract let us endeavor to look at the idea from some other and more ordinary point of viewlet us see how thoroughly and beautifully it is corroborated in an à posteriori consideration of matter as we actually find it  i have before said that attraction and repulsion being undeniably the sole properties by which matter is manifested to mind we are justified in assuming that matter exists only as attraction and repulsionin other words that attraction and repulsion are matter there being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term matter and the terms attraction and repulsion taken together as equivalent and therefore convertible expressions in logic       page   now the very definition of attraction implies particularitythe existence of parts particles or atoms for we define it as the tendency of each atom c to every other atom c according to a certain law of course where there are no partswhere there is absolute unitywhere the tendency to oneness is satisfiedthere can be no attractionthis has been fully shown and all philosophy admits it when on fulfilment of its purposes then matter shall have returned into its original condition of onea condition which presupposes the expulsion of the separative ether whose province and whose capacity are limited to keeping the atoms apart until that great day when this ether being no longer needed the overwhelming pressure of the finally collective attraction shall at length just sufficiently predominate and expel itwhen i say matter finally expelling the ether shall have returned into absolute unityit will then to speak paradoxically for the moment be matter without attraction and without repulsionin other words matter without matterin other words again matter no more in sinking into unity it will sink at once into that nothingness which to all finite perception unity must beinto that material nihility from which alone we can conceive it to have been evokedto have been created by the volition of god       gravity therefore must be the strongest of forcessee     page   i repeat thenlet us endeavor to comprehend that the final globe of globes will instantaneously disappear and that god will remain all in all  but are we here to pause not so on the universal agglomeration and dissolution we can readily conceive that a new and perhaps totally different series of conditions may ensueanother creation and irradiation returning into itselfanother action and rëaction of the divine will guiding our imaginations by that omniprevalent law of laws the law of periodicity are we not indeed more than justified in entertaining a belieflet us say rather in indulging a hopethat the processes we have here ventured to contemplate will be renewed forever and forever and forever a novel universe swelling into existence and then subsiding into nothingness at every throb of the heart divine  and nowthis heart divinewhat is it it is our own  let not the merely seeming irreverence of this idea frighten our souls from that cool exercise of consciousnessfrom that deep tranquillity of selfinspectionthrough which alone we can hope to attain the presence of this the most sublime of truths and look it leisurely in the face  the phænomena on which our conclusions must at this point depend are merely spiritual shadows but not the less thoroughly substantial  we walk about amid the destinies of our worldexistence encompassed by dim but ever present memories of a destiny more vastvery distant in the bygone time and infinitely awful  we live out a youth peculiarly haunted by such dreams yet never mistaking them for dreams as memories we know them during our youth the distinction is too clear to deceive us even for a moment  so long as this youth endures the feeling that we exist is the most natural of all feelings we understand it thoroughly that there was a period at which we did not existor that it might so have happened that we never had existed at allare the considerations indeed which during this youth we find difficulty in understanding why we should not exist is up to the epoch of our manhood of all queries the most unanswerable existenceselfexistenceexistence from all time and to all eternityseems up to the epoch of manhood a normal and unquestionable conditionseems because it is  but now comes the period at which a conventional worldreason awakens us from the truth of our dream doubt surprise and incomprehensibility arrive at the same moment they sayyou live and the time was when you lived not you have been created an intelligence exists greater than your own and it is only through this intelligence you live at all these things we struggle to comprehend and cannotcannot because these things being untrue are thus of necessity incomprehensible  no thinking being lives who at some luminous point of his life of thought has not felt himself lost amid the surges of futile efforts at understanding or believing that anything exists greater than his own soul the utter impossibility of any ones soul feeling itself inferior to another the intense overwhelming dissatisfaction and rebellion at the thoughtthese with the omniprevalent aspirations at perfection are but the spiritual coincident with the material struggles towards the original unityare to my mind at least a species of proof far surpassing what man terms demonstration that no one soul is inferior to anotherthat nothing is or can be superior to any one soulthat each soul is in part its own godits own creatorin a word that godthe material and spiritual godnow exists solely in the diffused matter and spirit of the universe and that the regathering of this diffused matter and spirit will be but the reconstitution of the purely spiritual and individual god  in this view and in this view alone we comprehend the riddles of divine injusticeof inexorable fate in this view alone the existence of evil becomes intelligible but in this view it becomes moreit becomes endurable our souls no longer rebel at a sorrow which we ourselves have imposed upon ourselves in furtherance of our own purposeswith a viewif even with a futile viewto the extension of our own joy  i have spoken of memories that haunt us during our youth they sometimes pursue us even in our manhoodassume gradually less and less indefinite shapesnow and then speak to us with low voices saying  there was an epoch in the night of time when a stillexistent being existedone of an absolutely infinite number of similar beings that people the absolutely infinite domains of the absolutely infinite space it was not and is not in the power of this beingany more than it is in your ownto extend by actual increase the joy of his existence but just as it is in your power to expand or to concentrate your pleasures the absolute amount of happiness remaining always the same so did and does a similar capability appertain to this divine being who thus passes his eternity in perpetual variation of concentrated self and almost infinite selfdiffusion what you call the universe is but his present expansive existence he now feels his life through an infinity of imperfect pleasuresthe partial and painintertangled pleasures of those inconceivably numerous things which you designate as his creatures but which are really but infinite individualizations of himself all these creaturesallthose which you term animate as well as those to whom you deny life for no better reason than that you do not behold it in operationall these creatures have in a greater or less degree a capacity for pleasure and for painbut the general sum of their sensations is precisely that amount of happiness which appertains by right to the divine being when concentrated within himself these creatures are all too more or less conscious intelligences conscious first of a proper identity conscious secondly and by faint indeterminate glimpses of an identity with the divine being of whom we speakof an identity with god of the two classes of consciousness fancy that the former will grow weaker the latter stronger during the long succession of ages which must elapse before these myriads of individual intelligences become blendedwhen the bright stars become blendedinto one think that the sense of individual identity will be gradually merged in the general consciousnessthat man for example ceasing imperceptibly to feel himself man will at length attain that awfully triumphant epoch when he shall recognize his existence as that of jehovah in the meantime
