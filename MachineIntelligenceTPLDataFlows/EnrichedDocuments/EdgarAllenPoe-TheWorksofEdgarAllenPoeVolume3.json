GORDON PYM\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\n      Upon my return to the United States a few months ago, after the\r\n      extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and\r\n      elsewhere, of which an account is given in the following pages,\r\n      accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in\r\n      Richmond, Va., who felt deep interest in all matters relating to\r\n      the regions I had visited, and who were constantly urging it upon\r\n      me, as a duty, to give my narrative to the public. I had several\r\n      reasons, however, for declining to do so, some of which were of a\r\n      nature altogether private, and concern no person but myself;\r\n      others not so much so. One consideration which deterred me was\r\n      that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time\r\n      in which I was absent, I feared I should not be able to write,\r\n      from mere memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have\r\n      the _appearance_of that truth it would really possess, barring\r\n      only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us\r\n      are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence\r\n      in exciting the imaginative faculties. Another reason was, that\r\n      the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively\r\n      marvellous that, unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be\r\n      (except by the evidence of a single individual, and he a\r\n      half-breed Indian), I could only hope for belief among my family,\r\n      and those of my friends who have had reason, through life, to put\r\n      faith in my veracity—the probability being that the public at\r\n      large would regard what I should put forth as merely an impudent\r\n      and ingenious fiction. A distrust in my own abilities as a writer\r\n      was, nevertheless, one of the principal causes which prevented me\r\n      from complying with the suggestions of my advisers.\r\n\r\n      Among those gentlemen in Virginia who expressed the greatest\r\n      interest in my statement, more particularly in regard to that\r\n      portion of it which related to the Antarctic Ocean, was Mr. Poe,\r\n      lately editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger,” a monthly\r\n      magazine, published by Mr. Thomas W. White, in the city of\r\n      Richmond. He strongly advised me, among others, to prepare at\r\n      once a full account of what I had seen and undergone, and trust\r\n      to the shrewdness and common-sense of the public—insisting, with\r\n      great plausibility, that however roughly, as regards mere\r\n      authorship, my book should be got up, its very uncouthness, if\r\n      there were any, would give it all the better chance of being\r\n      received as truth.\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding this representation, I did not make up my mind to\r\n      do as he suggested. He afterward proposed (finding that I would\r\n      not stir in the matter) that I should allow him to draw up, in\r\n      his own words, a narrative of the earlier portion of my\r\n      adventures, from facts afforded by myself, publishing it in the\r\n      “Southern Messenger” _under the garb of fiction. _To this,\r\n      perceiving no objection, I consented, stipulating only that my\r\n      real name should be retained. Two numbers of the pretended\r\n      fiction appeared, consequently, in the “Messenger” for January\r\n      and February (1837), and, in order that it might certainly be\r\n      regarded as fiction, the name of Mr. Poe was affixed to the\r\n      articles in the table of contents of the magazine.\r\n\r\n      The manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at\r\n      length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the\r\n      adventures in question; for I found that, in spite of the air of\r\n      fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of\r\n      my statement which appeared in the “Messenger” (without altering\r\n      or distorting a single fact), the public were still not at all\r\n      disposed to receive it as fable, and several letters were sent to\r\n      Mr. P.’s address, distinctly expressing a conviction to the\r\n      contrary. I thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would\r\n      prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence\r\n      of their own authenticity, and that I had consequently little to\r\n      fear on the score of popular incredulity.\r\n\r\n      This _exposé_being made, it will be seen at once how much of what\r\n      follows I claim to be my own writing; and it will also be\r\n      understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages\r\n      which were written by Mr. Poe. Even to those readers who have not\r\n      seen the “Messenger,” it will be unnecessary to point out where\r\n      his portion ends and my own commences; the difference in point of\r\n      style will be readily perceived.\r\n\r\nA. G. PYM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1\r\n\r\n\r\n      My name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My father was a respectable trader\r\n      in sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My maternal\r\n      grandfather was an attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in\r\n      every thing, and had speculated very successfully in stocks of\r\n      the Edgarton New Bank, as it was formerly called. By these and\r\n      other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money. He\r\n      was more attached to myself, I believe, than to any other person\r\n      in the world, and I expected to inherit the most of his property\r\n      at his death. He sent me, at six years of age, to the school of\r\n      old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric\r\n      manners—he is well known to almost every person who has visited\r\n      New Bedford. I stayed at his school until I was sixteen, when I\r\n      left him for Mr. E. Ronald’s academy on the hill. Here I became\r\n      intimate with the son of Mr. Barnard, a sea-captain, who\r\n      generally sailed in the employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh—Mr.\r\n      Barnard is also very well known in New Bedford, and has many\r\n      relations, I am certain, in Edgarton. His son was named Augustus,\r\n      and he was nearly two years older than myself. He had been on a\r\n      whaling voyage with his father in the John Donaldson, and was\r\n      always talking to me of his adventures in the South Pacific\r\n      Ocean. I used frequently to go home with him, and remain all day,\r\n      and sometimes all night. We occupied the same bed, and he would\r\n      be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories\r\n      of the natives of the Island of Tinian, and other places he had\r\n      visited in his travels. At last I could not help being interested\r\n      in what he said, and by degrees I felt the greatest desire to go\r\n      to sea. I owned a sailboat called the Ariel, and worth about\r\n      seventy-five dollars. She had a half-deck or cuddy, and was\r\n      rigged sloop-fashion—I forget her tonnage, but she would hold ten\r\n      persons without much crowding. In this boat we were in the habit\r\n      of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when I\r\n      now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am\r\n      alive to-day.\r\n\r\n      I will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a\r\n      longer and more momentous narrative. One night there was a party\r\n      at Mr. Barnard’s, and both Augustus and myself were not a little\r\n      intoxicated toward the close of it. As usual, in such cases, I\r\n      took part of his bed in preference to going home. He went to\r\n      sleep, as I thought, very quietly (it being near one when the\r\n      party broke up), and without saying a word on his favorite topic.\r\n      It might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in\r\n      bed, and I was just about falling into a doze, when he suddenly\r\n      started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go\r\n      to sleep for any Arthur Pym in Christendom, when there was so\r\n      glorious a breeze from the southwest. I never was so astonished\r\n      in my life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the\r\n      wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside\r\n      himself. He proceeded to talk very coolly, however, saying he\r\n      knew that I supposed him intoxicated, but that he was never more\r\n      sober in his life. He was only tired, he added, of lying in bed\r\n      on such a fine night like a dog, and was determined to get up and\r\n      dress, and go out on a frolic with the boat. I can hardly tell\r\n      what possessed me, but the words were no sooner out of his mouth\r\n      than I felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure, and\r\n      thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most\r\n      reasonable things in the world. It was blowing almost a gale, and\r\n      the weather was very cold—it being late in October. I sprang out\r\n      of bed, nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him I was\r\n      quite as brave as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying\r\n      in bed like a dog, and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as\r\n      any Augustus Barnard in Nantucket.\r\n\r\n      We lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to\r\n      the boat. She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the\r\n      lumber-yard of Pankey & Co., and almost thumping her side out\r\n      against the rough logs. Augustus got into her and bailed her, for\r\n      she was nearly half full of water. This being done, we hoisted\r\n      jib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly out to sea.\r\n\r\n      The wind, as I before said, blew freshly from the southwest. The\r\n      night was very clear and cold. Augustus had taken the helm, and I\r\n      stationed myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. We flew\r\n      along at a great rate—neither of us having said a word since\r\n      casting loose from the wharf. I now asked my companion what\r\n      course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable\r\n      we should get back. He whistled for a few minutes, and then said\r\n      crustily: “_I_ am going to sea—_you_ may go home if you think\r\n      proper.” Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once that, in\r\n      spite of his assumed _nonchalance_, he was greatly agitated. I\r\n      could see him distinctly by the light of the moon—his face was\r\n      paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he\r\n      could scarcely retain hold of the tiller. I found that something\r\n      had gone wrong, and became seriously alarmed. At this period I\r\n      knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending\r\n      entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend. The wind, too, had\r\n      suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the\r\n      land—still I was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for\r\n      almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. I could stand\r\n      it no longer, however, and spoke to Augustus about the propriety\r\n      of turning back. As before, it was nearly a minute before he made\r\n      answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. “By-and-by,” said he\r\n      at length—“time enough—home by-and-by.” I had expected a similar\r\n      reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which\r\n      filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again looked\r\n      at the speaker attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and\r\n      his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely\r\n      able to stand. “For God’s sake, Augustus,” I screamed, now\r\n      heartily frightened, “what ails you?—what is the matter?—what\r\n      _are_ you going to do?” “Matter!” he stammered, in the greatest\r\n      apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and\r\n      falling forward into the bottom of the boat—“matter—why, nothing\r\n      is the—matter—going home—d—d—don’t you see?” The whole truth now\r\n      flashed upon me. I flew to him and raised him up. He was\r\n      drunk—beastly drunk—he could no longer either stand, speak, or\r\n      see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go in the\r\n      extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the\r\n      bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. It was evident that,\r\n      during the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and\r\n      that his conduct in bed had been the result of a\r\n      highly-concentrated state of intoxication—a state which, like\r\n      madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward\r\n      demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. The\r\n      coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect—the\r\n      mental energy began to yield before its influence—and the\r\n      confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous\r\n      situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now\r\n      thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would\r\n      be otherwise for many hours.\r\n\r\n      It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. The\r\n      fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly\r\n      timid and irresolute. I knew that I was altogether incapable of\r\n      managing the boat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide\r\n      were hurrying us to destruction. A storm was evidently gathering\r\n      behind us; we had neither compass nor provisions; and it was\r\n      clear that, if we held our present course, we should be out of\r\n      sight of land before daybreak. These thoughts, with a crowd of\r\n      others equally fearful, flashed through my mind with a\r\n      bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me beyond\r\n      the possibility of making any exertion. The boat was going\r\n      through the water at a terrible rate—full before the wind—no reef\r\n      in either jib or mainsail—running her bows completely under the\r\n      foam. It was a thousand wonders she did not broach to—Augustus\r\n      having let go the tiller, as I said before, and I being too much\r\n      agitated to think of taking it myself. By good luck, however, she\r\n      kept steady, and gradually I recovered some degree of presence of\r\n      mind. Still the wind was increasing fearfully, and whenever we\r\n      rose from a plunge forward, the sea behind fell combing over our\r\n      counter, and deluged us with water. I was so utterly benumbed,\r\n      too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious of sensation. At\r\n      length I summoned up the resolution of despair, and rushing to\r\n      the mainsail let it go by the run. As might have been expected,\r\n      it flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with water, carried\r\n      away the mast short off by the board. This latter accident alone\r\n      saved me from instant destruction. Under the jib only, I now\r\n      boomed along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally\r\n      over the counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate\r\n      death. I took the helm, and breathed with greater freedom as I\r\n      found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape.\r\n      Augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat; and as\r\n      there was imminent danger of his drowning (the water being nearly\r\n      a foot deep just where he fell), I contrived to raise him\r\n      partially up, and keep him in a sitting position, by passing a\r\n      rope round his waist, and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of\r\n      the cuddy. Having thus arranged every thing as well as I could in\r\n      my chilled and agitated condition, I recommended myself to God,\r\n      and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the\r\n      fortitude in my power.\r\n\r\n      Hardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and\r\n      long scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons,\r\n      seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat.\r\n      Never while I live shall I forget the intense agony of terror I\r\n      experienced at that moment. My hair stood erect on my head—I felt\r\n      the blood congealing in my veins—my heart ceased utterly to beat,\r\n      and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my\r\n      alarm, I tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my\r\n      fallen companion.\r\n\r\n      I found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large\r\n      whaling-ship (the Penguin) bound to Nantucket. Several persons\r\n      were standing over me, and Augustus, paler than death, was busily\r\n      occupied in chafing my hands. Upon seeing me open my eyes, his\r\n      exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and\r\n      tears from the rough-looking personages who were present. The\r\n      mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained. We had\r\n      been run down by the whaling-ship, which was close-hauled,\r\n      beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture to set,\r\n      and consequently running almost at right angles to our own\r\n      course. Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not\r\n      perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming\r\n      in contact—their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so\r\n      terribly alarmed me. The huge ship, I was told, rode immediately\r\n      over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have\r\n      passed over a feather, and without the least perceptible\r\n      impediment to her progress. Not a scream arose from the deck of\r\n      the victim—there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling\r\n      with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was\r\n      swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her\r\n      destroyer—but this was all. Thinking our boat (which it will be\r\n      remembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless,\r\n      the captain (Captain E. T. V. Block, of New London) was for\r\n      proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about\r\n      the matter. Luckily, there were two of the look-out who swore\r\n      positively to having seen some person at our helm, and\r\n      represented the possibility of yet saving him. A discussion\r\n      ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said that “it\r\n      was no business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells;\r\n      that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense; and if\r\n      there was a man run down, it was nobody’s fault but his own, he\r\n      might drown and be dammed” or some language to that effect.\r\n      Henderson, the first mate, now took the matter up, being justly\r\n      indignant, as well as the whole ship’s crew, at a speech evincing\r\n      so base a degree of heartless atrocity. He spoke plainly, seeing\r\n      himself upheld by the men, told the captain he considered him a\r\n      fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey his orders\r\n      if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore. He\r\n      strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer)\r\n      on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm\r\n      voice, Hard-a-lee! The men flew to their posts, and the ship went\r\n      cleverly about. All this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it\r\n      was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that\r\n      any individual could be saved—allowing any to have been on board\r\n      the boat. Yet, as the reader has seen, both Augustus and myself\r\n      were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought\r\n      about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune\r\n      which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special\r\n      interference of Providence.\r\n\r\n      While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat\r\n      and jumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke\r\n      up as having seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of\r\n      the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long\r\n      and heavy roll to windward, and Henderson, at the same moment,\r\n      starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water. He\r\n      would say nothing else—repeating his cry impatiently, back water!\r\n      back water! The men put back as speedily as possible, but by this\r\n      time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway,\r\n      although all hands on board were making great exertions to take\r\n      in sail. In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung\r\n      to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another\r\n      huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of\r\n      water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety\r\n      was rendered obvious enough. The body of a man was seen to be\r\n      affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining\r\n      bottom (the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and\r\n      beating violently against it with every movement of the hull.\r\n      After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the\r\n      ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally\r\n      disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board—for the\r\n      body proved to be my own. It appeared that one of the\r\n      timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the\r\n      copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed under the ship,\r\n      and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. The\r\n      head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green\r\n      baize jacket I had on, and through the back part of my neck,\r\n      forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right\r\n      ear. I was immediately put to bed—although life seemed to be\r\n      totally extinct. There was no surgeon on board. The captain,\r\n      however, treated me with every attention—to make amends, I\r\n      presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in\r\n      the previous portion of the adventure.\r\n\r\n      In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship,\r\n      although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. He had not\r\n      been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our\r\n      boat, and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that\r\n      he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring\r\n      of the tempest. This induced the hardy seamen to persevere in\r\n      their search for more than half an hour, although repeated\r\n      signals to return were made them by Captain Block, and although\r\n      every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them\r\n      with the most imminent and deadly peril. Indeed, it is nearly\r\n      impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could\r\n      have escaped destruction for a single instant. She was built,\r\n      however, for the whaling service, and was fitted, as I have since\r\n      had reason to believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some\r\n      life-boats used on the coast of Wales.\r\n\r\n      After searching in vain for about the period of time just\r\n      mentioned, it was determined to get back to the ship. They had\r\n      scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark\r\n      object that floated rapidly by. They pursued and soon overtook\r\n      it. It proved to be the entire deck of the Ariel’s cuddy.\r\n      Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the last agonies.\r\n      Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a\r\n      rope to the floating timber. This rope, it will be remembered, I\r\n      had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt,\r\n      for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so\r\n      doing, it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving\r\n      his life. The Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down\r\n      her frame naturally went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as\r\n      might have been expected, was lifted, by the force of the water\r\n      rushing in, entirely from the main timbers, and floated (with\r\n      other fragments, no doubt) to the surface—Augustus was buoyed up\r\n      with it, and thus escaped a terrible death.\r\n\r\n      It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin\r\n      before he could give any account of himself, or be made to\r\n      comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our\r\n      boat. At length he became thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of\r\n      his sensations while in the water. Upon his first attaining any\r\n      degree of consciousness, he found himself beneath the surface,\r\n      whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity, and with a\r\n      rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck. In an\r\n      instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward, when, his\r\n      head striking violently against a hard substance, he again\r\n      relapsed into insensibility. Upon once more reviving he was in\r\n      fuller possession of his reason—this was still, however, in the\r\n      greatest degree clouded and confused. He now knew that some\r\n      accident had occurred, and that he was in the water, although his\r\n      mouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some\r\n      freedom. Possibly, at this period the deck was drifting rapidly\r\n      before the wind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his\r\n      back. Of course, as long as he could have retained this position,\r\n      it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned.\r\n      Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck, and this\r\n      post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals for help.\r\n      Just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been\r\n      obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into\r\n      the sea, had given himself up for lost. During the whole period\r\n      of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the\r\n      Ariel, nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his\r\n      disaster. A vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire\r\n      possession of his faculties. When he was finally picked up, every\r\n      power of his mind had failed him; and, as before said, it was\r\n      nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin before he\r\n      became fully aware of his condition. In regard to myself—I was\r\n      resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and\r\n      after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours\r\n      and a half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot\r\n      oil—a proceeding suggested by Augustus. The wound in my neck,\r\n      although of an ugly appearance, proved of little real\r\n      consequence, and I soon recovered from its effects.\r\n\r\n      The Penguin got into port about nine o’clock in the morning,\r\n      after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off\r\n      Nantucket. Both Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr.\r\n      Barnard’s in time for breakfast—which, luckily, was somewhat\r\n      late, owing to the party over night. I suppose all at the table\r\n      were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded\r\n      appearance—of course, it would not have borne a very rigid\r\n      scrutiny. Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way\r\n      of deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in\r\n      Nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story\r\n      told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at\r\n      sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils, had reference\r\n      either to the Ariel, my companion, or myself. We two have since\r\n      very frequently talked the matter over—but never without a\r\n      shudder. In one of our conversations Augustus frankly confessed\r\n      to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so\r\n      excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat\r\n      he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt\r\n      himself sinking beneath its influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\n\r\n      In no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce\r\n      inferences with entire certainty, even from the most simple data.\r\n      It might be supposed that a catastrophe such as I have just\r\n      related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for\r\n      the sea. On the contrary, I never experienced a more ardent\r\n      longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a\r\n      navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance.\r\n      This short period proved amply long enough to erase from my\r\n      memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the\r\n      pleasurably exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of\r\n      the late perilous accident. My conversations with Augustus grew\r\n      daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest. He had a\r\n      manner of relating his stories of the ocean (more than one half\r\n      of which I now suspect to have been sheer fabrications) well\r\n      adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament\r\n      and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination. It is strange,\r\n      too, that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the\r\n      life of a seaman, when he depicted his more terrible moments of\r\n      suffering and despair. For the bright side of the painting I had\r\n      a limited sympathy. My visions were of shipwreck and famine; of\r\n      death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged\r\n      out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in an\r\n      ocean unapproachable and unknown. Such visions or desires—for\r\n      they amounted to desires—are common, I have since been assured,\r\n      to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men—at the\r\n      time of which I speak I regarded them only as prophetic glimpses\r\n      of a destiny which I felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil.\r\n      Augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind. It is\r\n      probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had resulted in a\r\n      partial interchange of character.\r\n\r\n      About eighteen months after the period of the Ariel’s disaster,\r\n      the firm of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some\r\n      manner with the Messieurs Enderby, I believe, of Liverpool) were\r\n      engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig Grampus for a\r\n      whaling voyage. She was an old hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when\r\n      all was done to her that could be done. I hardly know why she was\r\n      chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same\r\n      owners—but so it was. Mr. Barnard was appointed to command her,\r\n      and Augustus was going with him. While the brig was getting\r\n      ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the\r\n      opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. He\r\n      found me by no means an unwilling listener—yet the matter could\r\n      not be so easily arranged. My father made no direct opposition;\r\n      but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the\r\n      design; and, more than all, my grandfather, from whom I expected\r\n      much, vowed to cut me off with a shilling if I should ever broach\r\n      the subject to him again. These difficulties, however, so far\r\n      from abating my desire, only added fuel to the flame. I\r\n      determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my\r\n      intentions to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it\r\n      might be accomplished. In the meantime I forbore speaking to any\r\n      of my relations in regard to the voyage, and, as I busied myself\r\n      ostensibly with my usual studies, it was supposed that I had\r\n      abandoned the design. I have since frequently examined my conduct\r\n      on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of\r\n      surprise. The intense hypocrisy I made use of for the furtherance\r\n      of my project—an hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my\r\n      life for so long a period of time—could only have been rendered\r\n      tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with\r\n      which I looked forward to the fulfilment of my long-cherished\r\n      visions of travel.\r\n\r\n      In pursuance of my scheme of deception, I was necessarily obliged\r\n      to leave much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for\r\n      the greater part of every day on board the Grampus, attending to\r\n      some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. At\r\n      night, however, we were sure to have a conference and talk over\r\n      our hopes. After nearly a month passed in this manner, without\r\n      our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told\r\n      me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary. I\r\n      had a relation living in New Bedford, a Mr. Ross, at whose house\r\n      I was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at\r\n      a time. The brig was to sail about the middle of June (June,\r\n      1827), and it was agreed that, a day or two before her putting to\r\n      sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual, from Mr. Ross,\r\n      asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with Robert and\r\n      Emmet (his sons). Augustus charged himself with the inditing of\r\n      this note and getting it delivered. Having set out as supposed,\r\n      for New Bedford, I was then to report myself to my companion, who\r\n      would contrive a hiding-place for me in the Grampus. This\r\n      hiding-place, he assured me, would be rendered sufficiently\r\n      comfortable for a residence of many days, during which I was not\r\n      to make my appearance. When the brig had proceeded so far on her\r\n      course as to make any turning back a matter out of question, I\r\n      should then, he said, be formally installed in all the comforts\r\n      of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh heartily\r\n      at the joke. Vessels enough would be met with by which a letter\r\n      might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents.\r\n\r\n      The middle of June at length arrived, and every thing had been\r\n      matured. The note was written and delivered, and on a Monday\r\n      morning I left the house for the New Bedford packet, as supposed.\r\n      I went, however, straight to Augustus, who was waiting for me at\r\n      the corner of a street. It had been our original plan that I\r\n      should keep out of the way until dark, and then slip on board the\r\n      brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our favor, it was\r\n      agreed to lose no time in secreting me. Augustus led the way to\r\n      the wharf, and I followed at a little distance, enveloped in a\r\n      thick seaman’s cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my\r\n      person might not be easily recognized. Just as we turned the\r\n      second corner, after passing Mr. Edmund’s well, who should\r\n      appear, standing right in front of me, and looking me full in the\r\n      face, but old Mr. Peterson, my grandfather. “Why, bless my soul,\r\n      Gordon,” said he, after a long pause, “why, why,—whose dirty\r\n      cloak is that you have on?” “Sir!” I replied, assuming, as well\r\n      as I could, in the exigency of the moment, an air of offended\r\n      surprise, and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable\r\n      tones—“sir! you are a sum’mat mistaken—my name, in the first\r\n      place, bee’nt nothing at all like Goddin, and I’d want you for to\r\n      know better, you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty\r\n      one.” For my life I could hardly refrain from screaming with\r\n      laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received\r\n      this handsome rebuke. He started back two or three steps, turned\r\n      first pale and then excessively red, threw up his spectacles,\r\n      then, putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with his umbrella\r\n      uplifted. He stopped short, however, in his career, as if struck\r\n      with a sudden recollection; and presently, turning round, hobbled\r\n      off down the street, shaking all the while with rage, and\r\n      muttering between his teeth: “Won’t do—new glasses—thought it was\r\n      Gordon—d—d good-for-nothing salt water Long Tom.”\r\n\r\n      After this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and\r\n      arrived at our point of destination in safety. There were only\r\n      one or two of the hands on board, and these were busy forward,\r\n      doing something to the forecastle combings. Captain Barnard, we\r\n      knew very well, was engaged at Lloyd and Vredenburgh’s, and would\r\n      remain there until late in the evening, so we had little to\r\n      apprehend on his account. Augustus went first up the vessel’s\r\n      side, and in a short while I followed him, without being noticed\r\n      by the men at work. We proceeded at once into the cabin, and\r\n      found no person there. It was fitted up in the most comfortable\r\n      style—a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. There were\r\n      four very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths.\r\n      There was also a large stove, I took notice, and a remarkably\r\n      thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin\r\n      and staterooms. The ceiling was full seven feet high, and, in\r\n      short, every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature\r\n      than I had anticipated. Augustus, however, would allow me but\r\n      little time for observation, insisting upon the necessity of my\r\n      concealing myself as soon as possible. He led the way into his\r\n      own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and\r\n      next to the bulkheads. Upon entering, he closed the door and\r\n      bolted it. I thought I had never seen a nicer little room than\r\n      the one in which I now found myself. It was about ten feet long,\r\n      and had only one berth, which, as I said before, was wide and\r\n      convenient. In that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads\r\n      there was a space of four feet square, containing a table, a\r\n      chair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books, chiefly books\r\n      of voyages and travels. There were many other little comforts in\r\n      the room, among which I ought not to forget a kind of safe or\r\n      refrigerator, in which Augustus pointed out to me a host of\r\n      delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department.\r\n\r\n      He now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the\r\n      carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know\r\n      that a portion of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had\r\n      been neatly cut out and again adjusted. As he pressed, this\r\n      portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of\r\n      his finger beneath. In this manner he raised the mouth of the\r\n      trap (to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks), and I\r\n      found that it led into the after hold. He next lit a small taper\r\n      by means of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a dark\r\n      lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me\r\n      follow. I did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by\r\n      means of a nail driven into the under side—the carpet, of course,\r\n      resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom, and\r\n      all traces of the aperture being concealed.\r\n\r\n      The taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest\r\n      difficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of\r\n      lumber among which I now found myself. By degrees, however, my\r\n      eyes became accustomed to the gloom, and I proceeded with less\r\n      trouble, holding on to the skirts of my friend’s coat. He brought\r\n      me, at length, after creeping and winding through innumerable\r\n      narrow passages, to an iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes\r\n      for packing fine earthenware. It was nearly four feet high, and\r\n      full six long, but very narrow. Two large empty oil-casks lay on\r\n      the top of it, and above these, again, a vast quantity of straw\r\n      matting, piled up as high as the floor of the cabin. In every\r\n      other direction around was wedged as closely as possible, even up\r\n      to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every species of\r\n      ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of crates,\r\n      hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less\r\n      than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the\r\n      box. I afterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the\r\n      stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough\r\n      concealment, having had only one assistant in the labour, a man\r\n      not going out in the brig.\r\n\r\n      My companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could\r\n      be removed at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the\r\n      interior, at which I was excessively amused. A mattress from one\r\n      of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it\r\n      contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be\r\n      crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time,\r\n      sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting\r\n      position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were\r\n      some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full\r\n      of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna\r\n      sausages, an enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a\r\n      dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs. I proceeded immediately\r\n      to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings\r\n      of higher satisfaction, I am sure, than any monarch ever\r\n      experienced upon entering a new palace. Augustus now pointed out\r\n      to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then,\r\n      holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark\r\n      whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my\r\n      hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the\r\n      lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold,\r\n      immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom. By\r\n      means of this cord I should be enabled readily to trace my way\r\n      out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident\r\n      should render such a step necessary. He now took his departure,\r\n      leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of\r\n      tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as often\r\n      as he could contrive to do so without observation. This was on\r\n      the seventeenth of June.\r\n\r\n      I remained three days and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in\r\n      my hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice\r\n      for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between\r\n      two crates just opposite the opening. During the whole period I\r\n      saw nothing of Augustus; but this occasioned me little\r\n      uneasiness, as I knew the brig was expected to put to sea every\r\n      hour, and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of\r\n      coming down to me. At length I heard the trap open and shut, and\r\n      presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was well, and\r\n      if there was any thing I wanted. “Nothing,” I replied; “I am as\r\n      comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?” “She will be\r\n      under weigh in less than half an hour,” he answered. “I came to\r\n      let you know, and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. I\r\n      shall not have a chance of coming down again for some\r\n      time—perhaps for three or four days more. All is going on right\r\n      aboveboard. After I go up and close the trap, do you creep along\r\n      by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in. You will find my\r\n      watch there—it may be useful to you, as you have no daylight to\r\n      keep time by. I suppose you can’t tell how long you have been\r\n      buried—only three days—this is the twentieth. I would bring the\r\n      watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed.” With this he\r\n      went up.\r\n\r\n      In about an hour after he had gone I distinctly felt the brig in\r\n      motion, and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly\r\n      commenced a voyage. Satisfied with this idea, I determined to\r\n      make my mind as easy as possible, and await the course of events\r\n      until I should be permitted to exchange the box for the more\r\n      roomy, although hardly more comfortable, accommodations of the\r\n      cabin. My first care was to get the watch. Leaving the taper\r\n      burning, I groped along in the dark, following the cord through\r\n      windings innumerable, in some of which I discovered that, after\r\n      toiling a long distance, I was brought back within a foot or two\r\n      of a former position. At length I reached the nail, and securing\r\n      the object of my journey, returned with it in safety. I now\r\n      looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided,\r\n      and selected the expedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of\r\n      the Columbia. With this I amused myself for some time, when,\r\n      growing sleepy, I extinguished the light with great care, and\r\n      soon fell into a sound slumber.\r\n\r\n      Upon awakening I felt strangely confused in mind, and some time\r\n      elapsed before I could bring to recollection all the various\r\n      circumstances of my situation. By degrees, however, I remembered\r\n      all. Striking a light, I looked at the watch; but it was run\r\n      down, and there were, consequently, no means of determining how\r\n      long I slept. My limbs were greatly cramped, and I was forced to\r\n      relieve them by standing between the crates. Presently feeling an\r\n      almost ravenous appetite, I bethought myself of the cold mutton,\r\n      some of which I had eaten just before going to sleep, and found\r\n      excellent. What was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a\r\n      state of absolute putrefaction! This circumstance occasioned me\r\n      great disquietude; for, connecting it with the disorder of mind I\r\n      experienced upon awakening, I began to suppose that I must have\r\n      slept for an inordinately long period of time. The close\r\n      atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this,\r\n      and might, in the end, be productive of the most serious results.\r\n      My head ached excessively; I fancied that I drew every breath\r\n      with difficulty; and, in short, I was oppressed with a multitude\r\n      of gloomy feelings. Still I could not venture to make any\r\n      disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound\r\n      up the watch, contented myself as well as possible.\r\n\r\n      Throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no\r\n      person came to my relief, and I could not help accusing Augustus\r\n      of the grossest inattention. What alarmed me chiefly was, that\r\n      the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint, and I was\r\n      suffering much from thirst, having eaten freely of the Bologna\r\n      sausages after the loss of my mutton. I became very uneasy, and\r\n      could no longer take any interest in my books. I was overpowered,\r\n      too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled at the thought of\r\n      indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious influence,\r\n      like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the hold.\r\n      In the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in\r\n      the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears\r\n      as if from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was\r\n      blowing. I could not imagine a reason for the absence of\r\n      Augustus. We were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to\r\n      allow of my going up. Some accident might have happened to\r\n      him—but I could think of none which would account for his\r\n      suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except, indeed, his\r\n      having suddenly died or fallen overboard, and upon this idea I\r\n      could not dwell with any degree of patience. It was possible that\r\n      we had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near\r\n      vicinity of Nantucket. This notion, however, I was forced to\r\n      abandon; for such being the case, the brig must have frequently\r\n      gone about; and I was entirely satisfied, from her continual\r\n      inclination to the larboard, that she had been sailing all along\r\n      with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter. Besides, granting\r\n      that we were still in the neighborhood of the island, why should\r\n      not Augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance?\r\n      Pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and\r\n      cheerless condition, I resolved to wait yet another twenty-four\r\n      hours, when, if no relief were obtained, I would make my way to\r\n      the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend,\r\n      or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a\r\n      further supply of water from the stateroom. While occupied with\r\n      this thought, however, I fell in spite of every exertion to the\r\n      contrary, into a state of profound sleep, or rather stupor. My\r\n      dreams were of the most terrific description. Every species of\r\n      calamity and horror befell me. Among other miseries I was\r\n      smothered to death between huge pillows, by demons of the most\r\n      ghastly and ferocious aspect. Immense serpents held me in their\r\n      embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully\r\n      shining eyes. Then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn\r\n      and awe-inspiring character, spread themselves out before me.\r\n      Immensely tall trunks of trees, gray and leafless, rose up in\r\n      endless succession as far as the eye could reach. Their roots\r\n      were concealed in wide-spreading morasses, whose dreary water lay\r\n      intensely black, still, and altogether terrible, beneath. And the\r\n      strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and waving to\r\n      and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters for\r\n      mercy, in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony\r\n      and despair. The scene changed; and I stood, naked and alone,\r\n      amidst the burning sand-plains of Sahara. At my feet lay crouched\r\n      a fierce lion of the tropics. Suddenly his wild eyes opened and\r\n      fell upon me. With a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet, and\r\n      laid bare his horrible teeth. In another instant there burst from\r\n      his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament, and I\r\n      fell impetuously to the earth. Stifling in a paroxysm of terror,\r\n      I at last found myself partially awake. My dream, then, was not\r\n      all a dream. Now, at least, I was in possession of my senses. The\r\n      paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my\r\n      bosom—his hot breath was in my ear—and his white and ghastly\r\n      fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom.\r\n\r\n      Had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the\r\n      utterance of a syllable, I could have neither stirred nor spoken.\r\n      The beast, whatever it was, retained his position without\r\n      attempting any immediate violence, while I lay in an utterly\r\n      helpless, and, I fancied, a dying condition beneath him. I felt\r\n      that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving me—in a word,\r\n      that I was perishing, and perishing of sheer fright. My brain\r\n      swam—I grew deadly sick—my vision failed—even the glaring\r\n      eyeballs above me grew dim. Making a last strong effort, I at\r\n      length breathed a faint ejaculation to God, and resigned myself\r\n      to die. The sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent\r\n      fury of the animal. He precipitated himself at full length upon\r\n      my body; but what was my astonishment, when, with a long and low\r\n      whine, he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest\r\n      eagerness, and with the most extravagant demonstration of\r\n      affection and joy! I was bewildered, utterly lost in\r\n      amazement—but I could not forget the peculiar whine of my\r\n      Newfoundland dog Tiger, and the odd manner of his caresses I well\r\n      knew. It was he. I experienced a sudden rush of blood to my\r\n      temples—a giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and\r\n      reanimation. I rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which I had\r\n      been lying, and, throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful\r\n      follower and friend, relieved the long oppression of my bosom in\r\n      a flood of the most passionate tears.\r\n\r\n      As upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the\r\n      greatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress.\r\n      For a long time I found it nearly impossible to connect any\r\n      ideas; but, by very slow degrees, my thinking faculties returned,\r\n      and I again called to memory the several incidents of my\r\n      condition. For the presence of Tiger I tried in vain to account;\r\n      and after busying myself with a thousand different conjectures\r\n      respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing that\r\n      he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort\r\n      by his caresses. Most people love their dogs—but for Tiger I had\r\n      an affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly,\r\n      did any creature more truly deserve it. For seven years he had\r\n      been my inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances\r\n      had given evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value\r\n      the animal. I had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of\r\n      a malignant little villain in Nantucket who was leading him, with\r\n      a rope around his neck, to the water; and the grown dog repaid\r\n      the obligation, about three years afterward, by saving me from\r\n      the bludgeon of a street robber.\r\n\r\n      Getting now hold of the watch, I found, upon applying it to my\r\n      ear, that it had again run down; but at this I was not at all\r\n      surprised, being convinced, from the peculiar state of my\r\n      feelings, that I had slept, as before, for a very long period of\r\n      time, how long, it was of course impossible to say. I was burning\r\n      up with fever, and my thirst was almost intolerable. I felt about\r\n      the box for my little remaining supply of water, for I had no\r\n      light, the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern, and\r\n      the phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand. Upon finding the\r\n      jug, however, I discovered it to be empty—Tiger, no doubt, having\r\n      been tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of\r\n      mutton, the bone of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the\r\n      box. The spoiled meat I could well spare, but my heart sank as I\r\n      thought of the water. I was feeble in the extreme—so much so that\r\n      I shook all over, as with an ague, at the slightest movement or\r\n      exertion. To add to my troubles, the brig was pitching and\r\n      rolling with great violence, and the oil-casks which lay upon my\r\n      box were in momentary danger of falling down, so as to block up\r\n      the only way of ingress or egress. I felt, also, terrible\r\n      sufferings from sea-sickness. These considerations determined me\r\n      to make my way, at all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate\r\n      relief, before I should be incapacitated from doing so\r\n      altogether. Having come to this resolve, I again felt about for\r\n      the phosphorus-box and tapers. The former I found after some\r\n      little trouble; but, not discovering the tapers as soon as I had\r\n      expected (for I remembered very nearly the spot in which I had\r\n      placed them), I gave up the search for the present, and bidding\r\n      Tiger lie quiet, began at once my journey toward the trap.\r\n\r\n      In this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever\r\n      apparent. It was with the utmost difficulty I could crawl along\r\n      at all, and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath\r\n      me; when, falling prostrate on my face, I would remain for some\r\n      minutes in a state bordering on insensibility. Still I struggled\r\n      forward by slow degrees, dreading every moment that I should\r\n      swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber, in\r\n      which event I had nothing but death to expect as the result. At\r\n      length, upon making a push forward with all the energy I could\r\n      command, I struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner\r\n      of an iron-bound crate. The accident only stunned me for a few\r\n      moments; but I found, to my inexpressible grief, that the quick\r\n      and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely\r\n      across my path, so as effectually to block up the passage. With\r\n      my utmost exertions I could not move it a single inch from its\r\n      position, it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes\r\n      and ship-furniture. It became necessary, therefore, enfeebled as\r\n      I was, either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out\r\n      a new passage, or to climb over the obstacle, and resume the path\r\n      on the other side. The former alternative presented too many\r\n      difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder. In\r\n      my present weak state of both mind and body, I should infallibly\r\n      lose my way if I attempted it, and perish miserably amid the\r\n      dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold. I proceeded,\r\n      therefore, without hesitation, to summon up all my remaining\r\n      strength and fortitude, and endeavour, as I best might, to\r\n      clamber over the crate.\r\n\r\n      Upon standing erect, with this end in view, I found the\r\n      undertaking even a more serious task than my fears had led me to\r\n      imagine. On each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall\r\n      of various heavy lumber, which the least blunder on my part might\r\n      be the means of bringing down upon my head; or, if this accident\r\n      did not occur, the path might be effectually blocked up against\r\n      my return by the descending mass, as it was in front by the\r\n      obstacle there. The crate itself was a long and unwieldy box,\r\n      upon which no foothold could be obtained. In vain I attempted, by\r\n      every means in my power, to reach the top, with the hope of being\r\n      thus enabled to draw myself up. Had I succeeded in reaching it,\r\n      it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly\r\n      inadequate to the task of getting over, and it was better in\r\n      every respect that I failed. At length, in a desperate effort to\r\n      force the crate from its ground, I felt a strong vibration in the\r\n      side next me. I thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks,\r\n      and found that a very large one was loose. With my pocket-knife,\r\n      which, luckily, I had with me, I succeeded, after great labour,\r\n      in prying it entirely off; and getting it through the aperture,\r\n      discovered, to my exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the\r\n      opposite side—in other words, that the top was wanting, it being\r\n      the bottom through which I had forced my way. I now met with no\r\n      important difficulty in proceeding along the line until I finally\r\n      reached the nail. With a beating heart I stood erect, and with a\r\n      gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap. It did not\r\n      rise as soon as I had expected, and I pressed it with somewhat\r\n      more determination, still dreading lest some other person than\r\n      Augustus might be in his state-room. The door, however, to my\r\n      astonishment, remained steady, and I became somewhat uneasy, for\r\n      I knew that it had formerly required but little or no effort to\r\n      remove it. I pushed it strongly—it was nevertheless firm: with\r\n      all my strength—it still did not give way: with rage, with fury,\r\n      with despair—it set at defiance my utmost efforts; and it was\r\n      evident, from the unyielding nature of the resistance, that the\r\n      hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up, or\r\n      that some immense weight had been placed upon it, which it was\r\n      useless to think of removing.\r\n\r\n      My sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay. In vain I\r\n      attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus\r\n      entombed. I could summon up no connected chain of reflection,\r\n      and, sinking on the floor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most\r\n      gloomy imaginings, in which the dreadful deaths of thirst,\r\n      famine, suffocation, and premature interment crowded upon me as\r\n      the prominent disasters to be encountered. At length there\r\n      returned to me some portion of presence of mind. I arose, and\r\n      felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture.\r\n      Having found them, I examined them closely to ascertain if they\r\n      emitted any light from the state-room; but none was visible. I\r\n      then forced the blade of my pen-knife through them, until I met\r\n      with some hard obstacle. Scraping against it, I discovered it to\r\n      be a solid mass of iron, which, from its peculiar wavy feel as I\r\n      passed the blade along it, I concluded to be a chain-cable. The\r\n      only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box, and\r\n      there either yield to my sad fate, or try so to tranquilize my\r\n      mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape. I\r\n      immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after\r\n      innumerable difficulties, in getting back. As I sank, utterly\r\n      exhausted, upon the mattress, Tiger threw himself at full length\r\n      by my side, and seemed as if desirous, by his caresses, of\r\n      consoling me in my troubles, and urging me to bear them with\r\n      fortitude.\r\n\r\n      The singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my\r\n      attention. After licking my face and hands for some minutes, he\r\n      would suddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine. Upon\r\n      reaching out my hand toward him, I then invariably found him\r\n      lying on his back, with his paws uplifted. This conduct, so\r\n      frequently repeated, appeared strange, and I could in no manner\r\n      account for it. As the dog seemed distressed, I concluded that he\r\n      had received some injury; and, taking his paws in my hands, I\r\n      examined them one by one, but found no sign of any hurt. I then\r\n      supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he\r\n      devoured with avidity—afterward, however, resuming his\r\n      extraordinary manoeuvres. I now imagined that he was suffering,\r\n      like myself, the torments of thirst, and was about adopting this\r\n      conclusion as the true one, when the idea occurred to me that I\r\n      had as yet only examined his paws, and that there might possibly\r\n      be a wound upon some portion of his body or head. The latter I\r\n      felt carefully over, but found nothing. On passing my hand,\r\n      however, along his back, I perceived a slight erection of the\r\n      hair extending completely across it. Probing this with my finger,\r\n      I discovered a string, and tracing it up, found that it encircled\r\n      the whole body. Upon a closer scrutiny, I came across a small\r\n      slip of what had the feeling of letter paper, through which the\r\n      string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it\r\n      immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\n\r\n      The thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note\r\n      from Augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having\r\n      happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had\r\n      devised this method of acquainting me with the true state of\r\n      affairs. Trembling with eagerness, I now commenced another search\r\n      for my phosphorus matches and tapers. I had a confused\r\n      recollection of having put them carefully away just before\r\n      falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the\r\n      trap, I had been able to remember the exact spot where I had\r\n      deposited them. But now I endeavored in vain to call it to mind,\r\n      and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious\r\n      search for the missing articles; never, surely, was there a more\r\n      tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense. At length, while\r\n      groping about, with my head close to the ballast, near the\r\n      opening of the box, and outside of it, I perceived a faint\r\n      glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage. Greatly\r\n      surprised, I endeavored to make my way toward it, as it appeared\r\n      to be but a few feet from my position. Scarcely had I moved with\r\n      this intention, when I lost sight of the glimmer entirely, and,\r\n      before I could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel\r\n      along by the box until I had exactly resumed my original\r\n      situation. Now, moving my head with caution to and fro, I found\r\n      that, by proceeding slowly, with great care, in an opposite\r\n      direction to that in which I had at first started, I was enabled\r\n      to draw near the light, still keeping it in view. Presently I\r\n      came directly upon it (having squeezed my way through innumerable\r\n      narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from some fragments\r\n      of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side. I\r\n      was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell\r\n      upon two or three pieces of taper wax, which had been evidently\r\n      mumbled by the dog. I concluded at once that he had devoured the\r\n      whole of my supply of candles, and I felt hopeless of being ever\r\n      able to read the note of Augustus. The small remnants of the wax\r\n      were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel, that I\r\n      despaired of deriving any service from them, and left them as\r\n      they were. The phosphorus, of which there was only a speck or\r\n      two, I gathered up as well as I could, and returned with it,\r\n      after much difficulty, to my box, where Tiger had all the while\r\n      remained.\r\n\r\n      What to do next I could not tell. The hold was so intensely dark\r\n      that I could not see my hand, however close I would hold it to my\r\n      face. The white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not\r\n      even that when I looked at it directly; by turning the exterior\r\n      portions of the retina toward it—that is to say, by surveying it\r\n      slightly askance, I found that it became in some measure\r\n      perceptible. Thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined, and the\r\n      note of my friend, if indeed it were a note from him, seemed only\r\n      likely to throw me into further trouble, by disquieting to no\r\n      purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind. In vain I\r\n      revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for\r\n      procuring light—such expedients precisely as a man in the\r\n      perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for\r\n      a similar purpose—each and all of which appear by turns to the\r\n      dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of\r\n      conceptions, just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties\r\n      flicker, alternately, one above the other. At last an idea\r\n      occurred to me which seemed rational, and which gave me cause to\r\n      wonder, very justly, that I had not entertained it before. I\r\n      placed the slip of paper on the back of a book, and, collecting\r\n      the fragments of the phosphorus matches which I had brought from\r\n      the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. I then, with the\r\n      palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly, yet steadily. A\r\n      clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole\r\n      surface; and had there been any writing upon it, I should not\r\n      have experienced the least difficulty, I am sure, in reading it.\r\n      Not a syllable was there, however—nothing but a dreary and\r\n      unsatisfactory blank; the illumination died away in a few\r\n      seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went.\r\n\r\n      I have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some\r\n      period prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on\r\n      idiocy. There were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect\r\n      sanity, and, now and then, even of energy; but these were few. It\r\n      must be remembered that I had been, for many days certainly,\r\n      inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a\r\n      whaling vessel, and for a long portion of that time but scantily\r\n      supplied with water. For the last fourteen or fifteen hours I had\r\n      none—nor had I slept during that time. Salt provisions of the\r\n      most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed, since the loss\r\n      of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception of the\r\n      sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as they\r\n      were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched\r\n      condition of my throat. I was now in a high state of fever, and\r\n      in every respect exceedingly ill. This will account for the fact\r\n      that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last\r\n      adventure with the phosphorus, before the thought suggested\r\n      itself that I had examined only one side of the paper. I shall\r\n      not attempt to describe my feelings of rage (for I believe I was\r\n      more angry than any thing else) when the egregious oversight I\r\n      had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception. The blunder\r\n      itself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and\r\n      impetuosity rendered it otherwise—in my disappointment at not\r\n      finding some words upon the slip, I had childishly torn it in\r\n      pieces and thrown it away, it was impossible to say where.\r\n\r\n      From the worst part of this dilemma I was relieved by the\r\n      sagacity of Tiger. Having got, after a long search, a small piece\r\n      of the note, I put it to the dog’s nose, and endeavored to make\r\n      him understand that he must bring me the rest of it. To my\r\n      astonishment, (for I had taught him none of the usual tricks for\r\n      which his breed are famous,) he seemed to enter at once into my\r\n      meaning, and, rummaging about for a few moments, soon found\r\n      another considerable portion. Bringing me this, he paused awhile,\r\n      and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for\r\n      my approval of what he had done. I patted him on the head, when\r\n      he immediately made off again. It was now some minutes before he\r\n      came back—but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip,\r\n      which proved to be all the paper missing—it having been torn, it\r\n      seems, only into three pieces. Luckily, I had no trouble in\r\n      finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were left—being\r\n      guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still\r\n      emitted. My difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution,\r\n      and I now took time to reflect upon what I was about to do. It\r\n      was very probable, I considered, that some words were written\r\n      upon that side of the paper which had not been examined—but which\r\n      side was that? Fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in\r\n      this respect, although it assured me that the words (if there\r\n      were any) would be found all on one side, and connected in a\r\n      proper manner, as written. There was the greater necessity of\r\n      ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt, as the\r\n      phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third\r\n      attempt, should I fail in the one I was now about to make. I\r\n      placed the paper on a book as before, and sat for some minutes\r\n      thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind. At last I\r\n      thought it barely possible that the written side might have some\r\n      unevenness on its surface, which a delicate sense of feeling\r\n      might enable me to detect. I determined to make the experiment\r\n      and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first\r\n      presented itself. Nothing, however, was perceptible, and I turned\r\n      the paper, adjusting it on the book. I now again carried my\r\n      forefinger cautiously along, when I was aware of an exceedingly\r\n      slight, but still discernable glow, which followed as it\r\n      proceeded. This, I knew, must arise from some very minute\r\n      remaining particles of the phosphorus with which I had covered\r\n      the paper in my previous attempt. The other, or under side, then,\r\n      was that on which lay the writing, if writing there should\r\n      finally prove to be. Again I turned the note, and went to work as\r\n      I had previously done. Having rubbed in the phosphorus, a\r\n      brilliancy ensued as before—but this time several lines of MS. in\r\n      a large hand, and apparently in red ink, became distinctly\r\n      visible. The glimmer, although sufficiently bright, was but\r\n      momentary. Still, had I not been too greatly excited, there would\r\n      have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three\r\n      sentences before me—for I saw there were three. In my anxiety,\r\n      however, to read all at once, I succeeded only in reading the\r\n      seven concluding words, which thus appeared—“blood—your life\r\n      depends upon lying close.”\r\n\r\n      Had I been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note—the\r\n      full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted\r\n      to convey, that admonition, even although it should have revealed\r\n      a story of disaster the most unspeakable, could not, I am firmly\r\n      convinced, have imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing\r\n      and yet indefinable horror with which I was inspired by the\r\n      fragmentary warning thus received. And “blood,” too, that word of\r\n      all words—so rife at all times with mystery, and suffering, and\r\n      terror—how trebly full of import did it now appear—how chilly and\r\n      heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from any foregoing words to\r\n      qualify or render it distinct) did its vague syllables fall, amid\r\n      the deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost recesses of my\r\n      soul!\r\n\r\n      Augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain\r\n      concealed, and I formed a thousand surmises as to what they could\r\n      be—but I could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution\r\n      of the mystery. Just after returning from my last journey to the\r\n      trap, and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the\r\n      singular conduct of Tiger, I had come to the resolution of making\r\n      myself heard at all events by those on board, or, if I could not\r\n      succeed in this directly, of trying to cut my way through the\r\n      orlop deck. The half certainty which I felt of being able to\r\n      accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency, had\r\n      given me courage (which I should not otherwise have had) to\r\n      endure the evils of my situation. The few words I had been able\r\n      to read, however, had cut me off from these final resources, and\r\n      I now, for the first time, felt all the misery of my fate. In a\r\n      paroxysm of despair I threw myself again upon the mattress,\r\n      where, for about the period of a day and night, I lay in a kind\r\n      of stupor, relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and\r\n      recollection.\r\n\r\n      At length I once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon\r\n      the horrors which encompassed me. For another twenty-four hours\r\n      it was barely possible that I might exist without water—for a\r\n      longer time I could not do so. During the first portion of my\r\n      imprisonment I had made free use of the cordials with which\r\n      Augustus had supplied me, but they only served to excite fever,\r\n      without in the least degree assuaging thirst. I had now only\r\n      about a gill left, and this was of a species of strong peach\r\n      liqueur at which my stomach revolted. The sausages were entirely\r\n      consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the\r\n      skin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had\r\n      been eaten by Tiger. To add to my troubles, I found that my\r\n      headache was increasing momentarily, and with it the species of\r\n      delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first\r\n      falling asleep. For some hours past it had been with the greatest\r\n      difficulty I could breathe at all, and now each attempt at so\r\n      doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic action of\r\n      the chest. But there was still another and very different source\r\n      of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose harassing terrors had been\r\n      the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the\r\n      mattress. It arose from the demeanor of the dog.\r\n\r\n      I first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in\r\n      the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt. As I rubbed, he\r\n      ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too\r\n      greatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the\r\n      circumstance. Soon afterward, it will be remembered, I threw\r\n      myself on the mattress, and fell into a species of lethargy.\r\n      Presently I became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my\r\n      ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was panting\r\n      and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his\r\n      eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. I spoke to him,\r\n      when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet.\r\n      Presently I relapsed into my stupor, from which I was again\r\n      awakened in a similar manner. This was repeated three or four\r\n      times, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a\r\n      degree of fear, that I became fully aroused. He was now lying\r\n      close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a\r\n      kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly\r\n      convulsed. I had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the\r\n      confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at\r\n      a loss what course to pursue. I could not endure the thought of\r\n      killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own\r\n      safety. I could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me\r\n      with an expression of the most deadly animosity, and I expected\r\n      every instant that he would attack me. At last I could endure my\r\n      terrible situation no longer, and determined to make my way from\r\n      the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition\r\n      should render it necessary for me to do so. To get out, I had to\r\n      pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate\r\n      my design—missing himself upon his fore-legs (as I perceived by\r\n      the altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his\r\n      white fangs, which were easily discernible. I took the remains of\r\n      the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured\r\n      them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which\r\n      Augustus had left me—then, folding my cloak around me as closely\r\n      as possible, I made a movement toward the mouth of the box. No\r\n      sooner did I do this, than the dog sprang with a loud growl\r\n      toward my throat. The whole weight of his body struck me on the\r\n      right shoulder, and I fell violently to the left, while the\r\n      enraged animal passed entirely over me. I had fallen upon my\r\n      knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these\r\n      protected me from a second furious assault, during which I felt\r\n      the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which\r\n      enveloped my neck—yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate\r\n      all the folds. I was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would\r\n      place me completely in his power. Despair gave me strength, and I\r\n      rose boldly up, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging\r\n      with me the blankets from the mattress. These I now threw over\r\n      him, and before he could extricate himself, I had got through the\r\n      door and closed it effectually against his pursuit. In this\r\n      struggle, however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of\r\n      ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to\r\n      a single gill of liqueur. As this reflection crossed my mind, I\r\n      felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which\r\n      might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar\r\n      circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it\r\n      to the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor.\r\n\r\n      Scarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when I heard my\r\n      name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the\r\n      direction of the steerage. So unexpected was anything of the\r\n      kind, and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the\r\n      sound, that I endeavoured in vain to reply. My powers of speech\r\n      totally failed, and in an agony of terror lest my friend should\r\n      conclude me dead, and return without attempting to reach me, I\r\n      stood up between the crates near the door of the box, trembling\r\n      convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance. Had a\r\n      thousand words depended upon a syllable, I could not have spoken\r\n      it. There was a slight movement now audible among the lumber\r\n      somewhere forward of my station. The sound presently grew less\r\n      distinct, then again less so, and still less. Shall I ever forget\r\n      my feelings at this moment? He was going—my friend, my companion,\r\n      from whom I had a right to expect so much—he was going—he would\r\n      abandon me—he was gone! He would leave me to perish miserably, to\r\n      expire in the most horrible and loathesome of dungeons—and one\r\n      word, one little syllable, would save me—yet that single syllable\r\n      I could not utter! I felt, I am sure, more than ten thousand\r\n      times the agonies of death itself. My brain reeled, and I fell,\r\n      deadly sick, against the end of the box.\r\n\r\n      As I fell the carving-knife was shaken out from the waist-band of\r\n      my pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor.\r\n      Never did any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my\r\n      ears! With the intensest anxiety I listened to ascertain the\r\n      effect of the noise upon Augustus—for I knew that the person who\r\n      called my name could be no one but himself. All was silent for\r\n      some moments. At length I again heard the word “Arthur!” repeated\r\n      in a low tone, and one full of hesitation. Reviving hope loosened\r\n      at once my powers of speech, and I now screamed at the top of my\r\n      voice, “Augustus! oh, Augustus!” “Hush! for God’s sake be\r\n      silent!” he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; “I will\r\n      be with you immediately—as soon as I can make my way through the\r\n      hold.” For a long time I heard him moving among the lumber, and\r\n      every moment seemed to me an age. At length I felt his hand upon\r\n      my shoulder, and he placed, at the same moment, a bottle of water\r\n      to my lips. Those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the\r\n      jaws of the tomb, or who have known the insufferable torments of\r\n      thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which\r\n      encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the\r\n      unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest\r\n      of all physical luxuries afforded.\r\n\r\n      When I had in some degree satisfied my thirst, Augustus produced\r\n      from his pocket three or four boiled potatoes, which I devoured\r\n      with the greatest avidity. He had brought with him a light in a\r\n      dark lantern, and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less\r\n      comfort than the food and drink. But I was impatient to learn the\r\n      cause of his protracted absence, and he proceeded to recount what\r\n      had happened on board during my incarceration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n\r\n\r\n      The brig put to sea, as I had supposed, in about an hour after he\r\n      had left the watch. This was on the twentieth of June. It will be\r\n      remembered that I had then been in the hold for three days; and,\r\n      during this period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and\r\n      so much running to and fro, especially in the cabin and\r\n      staterooms, that he had had no chance of visiting me without the\r\n      risk of having the secret of the trap discovered. When at length\r\n      he did come, I had assured him that I was doing as well as\r\n      possible; and, therefore, for the two next days he felt but\r\n      little uneasiness on my account—still, however, watching an\r\n      opportunity of going down. It was not until the fourth day that\r\n      he found one. Several times during this interval he had made up\r\n      his mind to let his father know of the adventure, and have me\r\n      come up at once; but we were still within reaching distance of\r\n      Nantucket, and it was doubtful, from some expressions which had\r\n      escaped Captain Barnard, whether he would not immediately put\r\n      back if he discovered me to be on board. Besides, upon thinking\r\n      the matter over, Augustus, so he told me, could not imagine that\r\n      I was in immediate want, or that I would hesitate, in such case,\r\n      to make myself heard at the trap. When, therefore, he considered\r\n      everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with\r\n      an opportunity of visiting me unobserved. This, as I said before,\r\n      did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the\r\n      watch, and the seventh since I had first entered the hold. He\r\n      then went down without taking with him any water or provisions,\r\n      intending in the first place merely to call my attention, and get\r\n      me to come from the box to the trap,—when he would go up to the\r\n      stateroom and thence hand me down a supply. When he descended for\r\n      this purpose he found that I was asleep, for it seems that I was\r\n      snoring very loudly. From all the calculations I can make on the\r\n      subject, this must have been the slumber into which I fell just\r\n      after my return from the trap with the watch, and which,\r\n      consequently, must have lasted for more than three entire days\r\n      and nights at the very least. Latterly, I have had reason both\r\n      from my own experience and the assurance of others, to be\r\n      acquainted with the strong soporific effects of the stench\r\n      arising from old fish-oil when closely confined; and when I think\r\n      of the condition of the hold in which I was imprisoned, and the\r\n      long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling\r\n      vessel, I am more inclined to wonder that I awoke at all, after\r\n      once falling asleep, than that I should have slept\r\n      uninterruptedly for the period specified above.\r\n\r\n      Augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing\r\n      the trap—but I made him no reply. He then shut the trap, and\r\n      spoke to me in a louder, and finally in a very loud tone—still I\r\n      continued to snore. He was now at a loss what to do. It would\r\n      take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box,\r\n      and in the meanwhile his absence would be noticed by Captain\r\n      Barnard, who had occasion for his services every minute, in\r\n      arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the\r\n      voyage. He determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and\r\n      await another opportunity of visiting me. He was the more easily\r\n      induced to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most\r\n      tranquil nature, and he could not suppose that I had undergone\r\n      any inconvenience from my incarceration. He had just made up his\r\n      mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an\r\n      unusual bustle, the sound of which proceeded apparently from the\r\n      cabin. He sprang through the trap as quickly as possible, closed\r\n      it, and threw open the door of his stateroom. No sooner had he\r\n      put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his\r\n      face, and he was knocked down, at the same moment, by a blow from\r\n      a handspike.\r\n\r\n      A strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp\r\n      upon his throat; still he was able to see what was going on\r\n      around him. His father was tied hand and foot, and lying along\r\n      the steps of the companion-way, with his head down, and a deep\r\n      wound in the forehead, from which the blood was flowing in a\r\n      continued stream. He spoke not a word, and was apparently dying.\r\n      Over him stood the first mate, eyeing him with an expression of\r\n      fiendish derision, and deliberately searching his pockets, from\r\n      which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer.\r\n      Seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were\r\n      rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they\r\n      soon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition. Besides\r\n      Augustus and Captain Barnard, there were nine men altogether in\r\n      the cabin, and these among the most ruffianly of the brig’s\r\n      company. The villains now went upon deck, taking my friend with\r\n      them after having secured his arms behind his back. They\r\n      proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was fastened down—two\r\n      of the mutineers standing by it with axes—two also at the main\r\n      hatch. The mate called out in a loud voice: “Do you hear there\r\n      below? tumble up with you, one by one—now, mark that—and no\r\n      grumbling!” It was some minutes before any one appeared:—at last\r\n      an Englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping\r\n      piteously, and entreating the mate, in the most humble manner, to\r\n      spare his life. The only reply was a blow on the forehead from an\r\n      axe. The poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan, and the\r\n      black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child, and\r\n      tossed him deliberately into the sea. Hearing the blow and the\r\n      plunge of the body, the men below could now be induced to venture\r\n      on deck neither by threats nor promises, until a proposition was\r\n      made to smoke them out. A general rush then ensued, and for a\r\n      moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken. The\r\n      mutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the forecastle\r\n      effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up.\r\n      These six, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without\r\n      arms, submitted after a brief struggle. The mate gave them fair\r\n      words—no doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for\r\n      they had no difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck. The\r\n      result proved his sagacity, no less than his diabolical villainy.\r\n      All in the forecastle presently signified their intention of\r\n      submitting, and, ascending one by one, were pinioned and then\r\n      thrown on their backs, together with the first six—there being in\r\n      all, of the crew who were not concerned in the mutiny,\r\n      twenty-seven.\r\n\r\n      A scene of the most horrible butchery ensued. The bound seamen\r\n      were dragged to the gangway. Here the cook stood with an axe,\r\n      striking each victim on the head as he was forced over the side\r\n      of the vessel by the other mutineers. In this manner twenty-two\r\n      perished, and Augustus had given himself up for lost, expecting\r\n      every moment his own turn to come next. But it seemed that the\r\n      villains were now either weary, or in some measure disgusted with\r\n      their bloody labour; for the four remaining prisoners, together\r\n      with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck with the rest,\r\n      were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the whole\r\n      murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until\r\n      sunset. They now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the\r\n      survivors, who lay not more than four paces off, and could\r\n      distinguish every word said. Upon some of the mutineers the\r\n      liquor appeared to have a softening effect, for several voices\r\n      were heard in favor of releasing the captives altogether, on\r\n      condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits. The\r\n      black cook, however (who in all respects was a perfect demon, and\r\n      who seemed to exert as much influence, if not more, than the mate\r\n      himself), would listen to no proposition of the kind, and rose\r\n      repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway.\r\n      Fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be\r\n      easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party, among\r\n      whom was a line-manager, who went by the name of Dirk Peters.\r\n      This man was the son of an Indian squaw of the tribe of\r\n      Upsarokas, who live among the fastnesses of the Black Hills, near\r\n      the source of the Missouri. His father was a fur-trader, I\r\n      believe, or at least connected in some manner with the Indian\r\n      trading-posts on Lewis river. Peters himself was one of the most\r\n      ferocious-looking men I ever beheld. He was short in stature, not\r\n      more than four feet eight inches high, but his limbs were of\r\n      Herculean mould. His hands, especially, were so enormously thick\r\n      and broad as hardly to retain a human shape. His arms, as well as\r\n      legs, were bowed in the most singular manner, and appeared to\r\n      possess no flexibility whatever. His head was equally deformed,\r\n      being of immense size, with an indentation on the crown (like\r\n      that on the head of most negroes), and entirely bald. To conceal\r\n      this latter deficiency, which did not proceed from old age, he\r\n      usually wore a wig formed of any hair-like material which\r\n      presented itself—occasionally the skin of a Spanish dog or\r\n      American grizzly bear. At the time spoken of, he had on a portion\r\n      of one of these bearskins; and it added no little to the natural\r\n      ferocity of his countenance, which betook of the Upsaroka\r\n      character. The mouth extended nearly from ear to ear, the lips\r\n      were thin, and seemed, like some other portions of his frame, to\r\n      be devoid of natural pliancy, so that the ruling expression never\r\n      varied under the influence of any emotion whatever. This ruling\r\n      expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth\r\n      were exceedingly long and protruding, and never even partially\r\n      covered, in any instance, by the lips. To pass this man with a\r\n      casual glance, one might imagine him to be convulsed with\r\n      laughter, but a second look would induce a shuddering\r\n      acknowledgment, that if such an expression were indicative of\r\n      merriment, the merriment must be that of a demon. Of this\r\n      singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring\r\n      men of Nantucket. These anecdotes went to prove his prodigious\r\n      strength when under excitement, and some of them had given rise\r\n      to a doubt of his sanity. But on board the Grampus, it seems, he\r\n      was regarded, at the time of the mutiny, with feelings more of\r\n      derision than of anything else. I have been thus particular in\r\n      speaking of Dirk Peters, because, ferocious as he appeared, he\r\n      proved the main instrument in preserving the life of Augustus,\r\n      and because I shall have frequent occasion to mention him\r\n      hereafter in the course of my narrative—a narrative, let me here\r\n      say, which, in its latter portions, will be found to include\r\n      incidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human\r\n      experience, and for this reason so far beyond the limits of human\r\n      credulity, that I proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining\r\n      credence for all that I shall tell, yet confidently trusting in\r\n      time and progressing science to verify some of the most important\r\n      and most improbable of my statements.\r\n\r\n      After much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was\r\n      determined at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of\r\n      Augustus, whom Peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping\r\n      as his clerk) should be set adrift in one of the smallest\r\n      whaleboats. The mate went down into the cabin to see if Captain\r\n      Barnard was still living—for, it will be remembered, he was left\r\n      below when the mutineers came up. Presently the two made their\r\n      appearance, the captain pale as death, but somewhat recovered\r\n      from the effects of his wound. He spoke to the men in a voice\r\n      hardly articulate, entreated them not to set him adrift, but to\r\n      return to their duty, and promising to land them wherever they\r\n      chose, and to take no steps for bringing them to justice. He\r\n      might as well have spoken to the winds. Two of the ruffians\r\n      seized him by the arms and hurled him over the brig’s side into\r\n      the boat, which had been lowered while the mate went below. The\r\n      four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and ordered\r\n      to follow, which they did without attempting any\r\n      resistance—Augustus being still left in his painful position,\r\n      although he struggled and prayed only for the poor satisfaction\r\n      of being permitted to bid his father farewell. A handful of\r\n      sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed down; but neither\r\n      mast, sail, oar, nor compass. The boat was towed astern for a few\r\n      minutes, during which the mutineers held another consultation—it\r\n      was then finally cut adrift. By this time night had come on—there\r\n      were neither moon nor stars visible—and a short and ugly sea was\r\n      running, although there was no great deal of wind. The boat was\r\n      instantly out of sight, and little hope could be entertained for\r\n      the unfortunate sufferers who were in it. This event happened,\r\n      however, in latitude 35 degrees 30’ north, longitude 61 degrees\r\n      20’ west, and consequently at no very great distance from the\r\n      Bermuda Islands. Augustus therefore endeavored to console himself\r\n      with the idea that the boat might either succeed in reaching the\r\n      land, or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by vessels\r\n      off the coast.\r\n\r\n      All sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her\r\n      original course to the southwest—the mutineers being bent upon\r\n      some piratical expedition, in which, from all that could be\r\n      understood, a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the Cape\r\n      Verd Islands to Porto Rico. No attention was paid to Augustus,\r\n      who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the\r\n      cabin companion-way. Dirk Peters treated him with some degree of\r\n      kindness, and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the\r\n      cook. His situation was still one of the most precarious, as the\r\n      men were continually intoxicated, and there was no relying upon\r\n      their continued good-humor or carelessness in regard to himself.\r\n      His anxiety on my account he represented, however, as the most\r\n      distressing result of his condition; and, indeed, I had never\r\n      reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship. More than once\r\n      he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my\r\n      being on board, but was restrained from so doing, partly through\r\n      recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld, and partly\r\n      through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief. For the\r\n      latter purpose he was constantly on the watch; but, in spite of\r\n      the most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after the boat\r\n      was cut adrift before any chance occurred. At length, on the\r\n      night of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the\r\n      eastward, and all hands were called up to take in sail. During\r\n      the confusion which ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and\r\n      into the stateroom. What was his grief and horror in discovering\r\n      that the latter had been rendered a place of deposit for a\r\n      variety of sea-stores and ship-furniture, and that several\r\n      fathoms of old chain-cable, which had been stowed away beneath\r\n      the companion-ladder, had been dragged thence to make room for a\r\n      chest, and were now lying immediately upon the trap! To remove it\r\n      without discovery was impossible, and he returned on deck as\r\n      quickly as he could. As he came up, the mate seized him by the\r\n      throat, and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin, was\r\n      about flinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was\r\n      again preserved through the interference of Dirk Peters. Augustus\r\n      was now put in handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on\r\n      board), and his feet lashed tightly together. He was then taken\r\n      into the steerage, and thrown into a lower berth next to the\r\n      forecastle bulkheads, with the assurance that he should never put\r\n      his foot on deck again “until the brig was no longer a brig.”\r\n      This was the expression of the cook, who threw him into the\r\n      berth—it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended\r\n      by the phrase. The whole affair, however, proved the ultimate\r\n      means of my relief, as will presently appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5\r\n\r\n\r\n      For some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle, Augustus\r\n      abandoned himself to despair, never hoping to leave the berth\r\n      alive. He now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of\r\n      the men who should come down with my situation, thinking it\r\n      better to let me take my chance with the mutineers than perish of\r\n      thirst in the hold,—for it had been ten days since I was first\r\n      imprisoned, and my jug of water was not a plentiful supply even\r\n      for four. As he was thinking on this subject, the idea came all\r\n      at once into his head that it might be possible to communicate\r\n      with me by the way of the main hold. In any other circumstances,\r\n      the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have prevented\r\n      him from attempting it; but now he had, at all events, little\r\n      prospect of life, and consequently little to lose, he bent his\r\n      whole mind, therefore, upon the task.\r\n\r\n      His handcuffs were the first consideration. At first he saw no\r\n      method of removing them, and feared that he should thus be\r\n      baffled in the very outset; but upon a closer scrutiny he\r\n      discovered that the irons could be slipped off and on at\r\n      pleasure, with very little effort or inconvenience, merely by\r\n      squeezing his hands through them,—this species of manacle being\r\n      altogether ineffectual in confining young persons, in whom the\r\n      smaller bones readily yield to pressure. He now untied his feet,\r\n      and, leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be\r\n      readjusted in the event of any person’s coming down, proceeded to\r\n      examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth. The partition\r\n      here was of soft pine board, an inch thick, and he saw that he\r\n      should have little trouble in cutting his way through. A voice\r\n      was now heard at the forecastle companion-way, and he had just\r\n      time to put his right hand into its handcuff (the left had not\r\n      been removed) and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his\r\n      ankle, when Dirk Peters came below, followed by Tiger, who\r\n      immediately leaped into the berth and lay down. The dog had been\r\n      brought on board by Augustus, who knew my attachment to the\r\n      animal, and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me\r\n      during the voyage. He went up to our house for him immediately\r\n      after first taking me into the hold, but did not think of\r\n      mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch. Since\r\n      the mutiny, Augustus had not seen him before his appearance with\r\n      Dirk Peters, and had given him up for lost, supposing him to have\r\n      been thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging\r\n      to the mate’s gang. It appeared afterward that he had crawled\r\n      into a hole beneath a whale-boat, from which, not having room to\r\n      turn round, he could not extricate himself. Peters at last let\r\n      him out, and, with a species of good feeling which my friend knew\r\n      well how to appreciate, had now brought him to him in the\r\n      forecastle as a companion, leaving at the same time some salt\r\n      junk and potatoes, with a can of water, he then went on deck,\r\n      promising to come down with something more to eat on the next\r\n      day.\r\n\r\n      When he had gone, Augustus freed both hands from the manacles and\r\n      unfastened his feet. He then turned down the head of the mattress\r\n      on which he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the\r\n      ruffians had not thought it worth while to search him) commenced\r\n      cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks, as closely\r\n      as possible to the floor of the berth. He chose to cut here,\r\n      because, if suddenly interrupted, he would be able to conceal\r\n      what had been done by letting the head of the mattress fall into\r\n      its proper position. For the remainder of the day, however, no\r\n      disturbance occurred, and by night he had completely divided the\r\n      plank. It should here be observed that none of the crew occupied\r\n      the forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the\r\n      cabin since the mutiny, drinking the wines and feasting on the\r\n      sea-stores of Captain Barnard, and giving no more heed than was\r\n      absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig. These\r\n      circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and Augustus; for,\r\n      had matters been otherwise, he would have found it impossible to\r\n      reach me. As it was, he proceeded with confidence in his design.\r\n      It was near daybreak, however, before he completed the second\r\n      division of the board (which was about a foot above the first\r\n      cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his\r\n      passage through with facility to the main orlop deck. Having got\r\n      here, he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main\r\n      hatch, although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of\r\n      oil-casks piled nearly as high as the upper deck, there being\r\n      barely room enough left for his body. Upon reaching the hatch he\r\n      found that Tiger had followed him below, squeezing between two\r\n      rows of the casks. It was now too late, however, to attempt\r\n      getting to me before dawn, as the chief difficulty lay in passing\r\n      through the close stowage in the lower hold. He therefore\r\n      resolved to return, and wait till the next night. With this\r\n      design, he proceeded to loosen the hatch, so that he might have\r\n      as little detention as possible when he should come again. No\r\n      sooner had he loosened it than Tiger sprang eagerly to the small\r\n      opening produced, snuffed for a moment, and then uttered a long\r\n      whine, scratching at the same time, as if anxious to remove the\r\n      covering with his paws. There could be no doubt, from his\r\n      behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and\r\n      Augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me\r\n      if he put him down. He now hit upon the expedient of sending the\r\n      note, as it was especially desirable that I should make no\r\n      attempt at forcing my way out at least under existing\r\n      circumstances, and there could be no certainty of his getting to\r\n      me himself on the morrow as he intended. After-events proved how\r\n      fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did; for,\r\n      had it not been for the receipt of the note, I should undoubtedly\r\n      have fallen upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the\r\n      crew, and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed\r\n      in consequence.\r\n\r\n      Having concluded to write, the difficulty was now to procure the\r\n      materials for so doing. An old toothpick was soon made into a\r\n      pen; and this by means of feeling altogether, for the\r\n      between-decks was as dark as pitch. Paper enough was obtained\r\n      from the back of a letter—a duplicate of the forged letter from\r\n      Mr. Ross. This had been the original draught; but the handwriting\r\n      not being sufficiently well imitated, Augustus had written\r\n      another, thrusting the first, by good fortune, into his\r\n      coat-pocket, where it was now most opportunely discovered. Ink\r\n      alone was thus wanting, and a substitute was immediately found\r\n      for this by means of a slight incision with the pen-knife on the\r\n      back of a finger just above the nail—a copious flow of blood\r\n      ensuing, as usual, from wounds in that vicinity. The note was now\r\n      written, as well as it could be in the dark and under the\r\n      circumstances. It briefly explained that a mutiny had taken\r\n      place; that Captain Barnard was set adrift; and that I might\r\n      expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned, but\r\n      must not venture upon making any disturbance. It concluded with\r\n      these words: “_I have scrawled this with blood—your life depends\r\n      upon lying close._”\r\n\r\n      This slip of paper being tied upon the dog, he was now put down\r\n      the hatchway, and Augustus made the best of his way back to the\r\n      forecastle, where he found no reason to believe that any of the\r\n      crew had been in his absence. To conceal the hole in the\r\n      partition, he drove his knife in just above it, and hung up a\r\n      pea-jacket which he found in the berth. His handcuffs were then\r\n      replaced, and also the rope around his ankles.\r\n\r\n      These arrangements were scarcely completed when Dirk Peters came\r\n      below, very drunk, but in excellent humour, and bringing with him\r\n      my friend’s allowance of provision for the day. This consisted of\r\n      a dozen large Irish potatoes roasted, and a pitcher of water. He\r\n      sat for some time on a chest by the berth, and talked freely\r\n      about the mate and the general concerns of the brig. His\r\n      demeanour was exceedingly capricious, and even grotesque. At one\r\n      time Augustus was much alarmed by odd conduct. At last, however,\r\n      he went on deck, muttering a promise to bring his prisoner a good\r\n      dinner on the morrow. During the day two of the crew (harpooners)\r\n      came down, accompanied by the cook, all three in nearly the last\r\n      stage of intoxication. Like Peters, they made no scruple of\r\n      talking unreservedly about their plans. It appeared that they\r\n      were much divided among themselves as to their ultimate course,\r\n      agreeing in no point, except the attack on the ship from the Cape\r\n      Verd Islands, with which they were in hourly expectation of\r\n      meeting. As far as could be ascertained, the mutiny had not been\r\n      brought about altogether for the sake of booty; a private pique\r\n      of the chief mate’s against Captain Barnard having been the main\r\n      instigation. There now seemed to be two principal factions among\r\n      the crew—one headed by the mate, the other by the cook. The\r\n      former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel which\r\n      should present itself, and equipping it at some of the West India\r\n      Islands for a piratical cruise. The latter division, however,\r\n      which was the stronger, and included Dirk Peters among its\r\n      partisans, were bent upon pursuing the course originally laid out\r\n      for the brig into the South Pacific; there either to take whale,\r\n      or act otherwise, as circumstances should suggest. The\r\n      representations of Peters, who had frequently visited these\r\n      regions, had great weight, apparently, with the mutineers,\r\n      wavering, as they were, between half-engendered notions of profit\r\n      and pleasure. He dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to\r\n      be found among the innumerable islands of the Pacific, on the\r\n      perfect security and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed,\r\n      but, more particularly, on the deliciousness of the climate, on\r\n      the abundant means of good living, and on the voluptuous beauty\r\n      of the women. As yet, nothing had been absolutely determined\r\n      upon; but the pictures of the hybrid line-manager were taking\r\n      strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen, and there\r\n      was every possibility that his intentions would be finally\r\n      carried into effect.\r\n\r\n      The three men went away in about an hour, and no one else entered\r\n      the forecastle all day. Augustus lay quiet until nearly night. He\r\n      then freed himself from the rope and irons, and prepared for his\r\n      attempt. A bottle was found in one of the berths, and this he\r\n      filled with water from the pitcher left by Peters, storing his\r\n      pockets at the same time with cold potatoes. To his great joy he\r\n      also came across a lantern, with a small piece of tallow candle\r\n      in it. This he could light at any moment, as he had in his\r\n      possession a box of phosphorus matches. When it was quite dark,\r\n      he got through the hole in the bulkhead, having taken the\r\n      precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey\r\n      the idea of a person covered up. When through, he hung up the\r\n      pea-jacket on his knife, as before, to conceal the aperture—this\r\n      manoeuvre being easily effected, as he did not readjust the piece\r\n      of plank taken out until afterward. He was now on the main orlop\r\n      deck, and proceeded to make his way, as before, between the upper\r\n      deck and the oil-casks to the main hatchway. Having reached this,\r\n      he lit the piece of candle, and descended, groping with extreme\r\n      difficulty among the compact stowage of the hold. In a few\r\n      moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench and the\r\n      closeness of the atmosphere. He could not think it possible that\r\n      I had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so\r\n      oppressive an air. He called my name repeatedly, but I made him\r\n      no reply, and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed. The\r\n      brig was rolling violently, and there was so much noise in\r\n      consequence, that it was useless to listen for any weak sound,\r\n      such as those of my breathing or snoring. He threw open the\r\n      lantern, and held it as high as possible, whenever an opportunity\r\n      occurred, in order that, by observing the light, I might, if\r\n      alive, be aware that succor was approaching. Still nothing was\r\n      heard from me, and the supposition of my death began to assume\r\n      the character of certainty. He determined, nevertheless, to force\r\n      a passage, if possible, to the box, and at least ascertain beyond\r\n      a doubt the truth of his surmises. He pushed on for some time in\r\n      a most pitiable state of anxiety, until, at length, he found the\r\n      pathway utterly blocked up, and that there was no possibility of\r\n      making any farther way by the course in which he had set out.\r\n      Overcome now by his feelings, he threw himself among the lumber\r\n      in despair, and wept like a child. It was at this period that he\r\n      heard the crash occasioned by the bottle which I had thrown down.\r\n      Fortunate, indeed, was it that the incident occurred—for, upon\r\n      this incident, trivial as it appears, the thread of my destiny\r\n      depended. Many years elapsed, however, before I was aware of this\r\n      fact. A natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision\r\n      prevented Augustus from confiding to me at once what a more\r\n      intimate and unreserved communion afterward induced him to\r\n      reveal. Upon finding his further progress in the hold impeded by\r\n      obstacles which he could not overcome, he had resolved to abandon\r\n      his attempt at reaching me, and return at once to the forecastle.\r\n      Before condemning him entirely on this head, the harassing\r\n      circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken into\r\n      consideration. The night was fast wearing away, and his absence\r\n      from the forecastle might be discovered; and indeed would\r\n      necessarily be so, if he should fail to get back to the berth by\r\n      daybreak. His candle was expiring in the socket, and there would\r\n      be the greatest difficulty in retracing his way to the hatchway\r\n      in the dark. It must be allowed, too, that he had every good\r\n      reason to believe me dead; in which event no benefit could result\r\n      to me from his reaching the box, and a world of danger would be\r\n      encountered to no purpose by himself. He had repeatedly called,\r\n      and I had made him no answer. I had been now eleven days and\r\n      nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he\r\n      had left with me—a supply which it was not at all probable I had\r\n      hoarded in the beginning of my confinement, as I had every cause\r\n      to expect a speedy release. The atmosphere of the hold, too, must\r\n      have appeared to him, coming from the comparatively open air of\r\n      the steerage, of a nature absolutely poisonous, and by far more\r\n      intolerable than it had seemed to me upon my first taking up my\r\n      quarters in the box—the hatchways at that time having been\r\n      constantly open for many months previous. Add to these\r\n      considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so\r\n      lately witnessed by my friend; his confinement, privations, and\r\n      narrow escapes from death, together with the frail and equivocal\r\n      tenure by which he still existed—circumstances all so well\r\n      calculated to prostrate every energy of mind—and the reader will\r\n      be easily brought, as I have been, to regard his apparent falling\r\n      off in friendship and in faith with sentiments rather of sorrow\r\n      than of anger.\r\n\r\n      The crash of the bottle was distinctly heard, yet Augustus was\r\n      not sure that it proceeded from the hold. The doubt, however, was\r\n      sufficient inducement to persevere. He clambered up nearly to the\r\n      orlop deck by means of the stowage, and then, watching for a lull\r\n      in the pitchings of the vessel, he called out to me in as loud a\r\n      tone as he could command, regardless, for the moment, of being\r\n      overheard by the crew. It will be remembered that on this\r\n      occasion the voice reached me, but I was so entirely overcome by\r\n      violent agitation as to be incapable of reply. Confident, now,\r\n      that his worst apprehensions were well founded, he descended,\r\n      with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss of\r\n      time. In his haste some small boxes were thrown down, the noise\r\n      occasioned by which I heard, as will be recollected. He had made\r\n      considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife\r\n      again caused him to hesitate. He retraced his steps immediately,\r\n      and, clambering up the stowage a second time, called out my name,\r\n      loudly as before, having watched for a lull. This time I found\r\n      voice to answer. Overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive,\r\n      he now resolved to brave every difficulty and danger in reaching\r\n      me. Having extricated himself as quickly as possible from the\r\n      labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed in, he at length\r\n      struck into an opening which promised better, and finally, after\r\n      a series of struggles, arrived at the box in a state of utter\r\n      exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6\r\n\r\n\r\n      The leading particulars of this narration were all that Augustus\r\n      communicated to me while we remained near the box. It was not\r\n      until afterward that he entered fully into all the details. He\r\n      was apprehensive of being missed, and I was wild with impatience\r\n      to leave my detested place of confinement. We resolved to make\r\n      our way at once to the hole in the bulkhead, near which I was to\r\n      remain for the present, while he went through to reconnoiter. To\r\n      leave Tiger in the box was what neither of us could endure to\r\n      think of, yet, how to act otherwise was the question. He now\r\n      seemed to be perfectly quiet, and we could not even distinguish\r\n      the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely to the\r\n      box. I was convinced that he was dead, and determined to open the\r\n      door. We found him lying at full length, apparently in a deep\r\n      stupor, yet still alive. No time was to be lost, yet I could not\r\n      bring myself to abandon an animal who had now been twice\r\n      instrumental in saving my life, without some attempt at\r\n      preserving him. We therefore dragged him along with us as well as\r\n      we could, although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue;\r\n      Augustus, during part of the time, being forced to clamber over\r\n      the impediments in our way with the huge dog in his arms—a feat\r\n      to which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally\r\n      inadequate. At length we succeeded in reaching the hole, when\r\n      Augustus got through, and Tiger was pushed in afterward. All was\r\n      found to be safe, and we did not fail to return sincere thanks to\r\n      God for our deliverance from the imminent danger we had escaped.\r\n      For the present, it was agreed that I should remain near the\r\n      opening, through which my companion could readily supply me with\r\n      a part of his daily provision, and where I could have the\r\n      advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure.\r\n\r\n      In explanation of some portions of this narrative, wherein I have\r\n      spoken of the stowage of the brig, and which may appear ambiguous\r\n      to some of my readers who may have seen a proper or regular\r\n      stowage, I must here state that the manner in which this most\r\n      important duty had been performed on board the Grampus was a most\r\n      shameful piece of neglect on the part of Captain Barnard, who was\r\n      by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman as the\r\n      hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would\r\n      seem necessarily to demand. A proper stowage cannot be\r\n      accomplished in a careless manner, and many most disastrous\r\n      accidents, even within the limits of my own experience, have\r\n      arisen from neglect or ignorance in this particular. Coasting\r\n      vessels, in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking\r\n      in or discharging cargo, are the most liable to mishap from the\r\n      want of a proper attention to stowage. The great point is to\r\n      allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting position\r\n      even in the most violent rollings of the vessel. With this end,\r\n      great attention must be paid, not only to the bulk taken in, but\r\n      to the nature of the bulk, and whether there be a full or only a\r\n      partial cargo. In most kinds of freight the stowage is\r\n      accomplished by means of a screw. Thus, in a load of tobacco or\r\n      flour, the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the\r\n      vessel that the barrels or hogsheads, upon discharging, are found\r\n      to be completely flattened, and take some time to regain their\r\n      original shape. This screwing, however, is resorted to\r\n      principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold; for\r\n      in a full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco, there\r\n      can be no danger of any shifting whatever, at least none from\r\n      which inconvenience can result. There have been instances,\r\n      indeed, where this method of screwing has resulted in the most\r\n      lamentable consequences, arising from a cause altogether distinct\r\n      from the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo. A load of\r\n      cotton, for example, tightly screwed while in certain conditions,\r\n      has been known, through the expansion of its bulk, to rend a\r\n      vessel asunder at sea. There can be no doubt either that the same\r\n      result would ensue in the case of tobacco, while undergoing its\r\n      usual course of fermentation, were it not for the interstices\r\n      consequent upon the rotundity of the hogsheads.\r\n\r\n      It is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to\r\n      be apprehended from shifting, and that precautions should be\r\n      always taken to guard against such misfortune. Only those who\r\n      have encountered a violent gale of wind, or rather who have\r\n      experienced the rolling of a vessel in a sudden calm after the\r\n      gale, can form an idea of the tremendous force of the plunges,\r\n      and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose\r\n      articles in the vessel. It is then that the necessity of a\r\n      cautious stowage, when there is a partial cargo, becomes obvious.\r\n      When lying-to (especially with a small head sail), a vessel which\r\n      is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon\r\n      her beam-ends; this occurring even every fifteen or twenty\r\n      minutes upon an average, yet without any serious consequences\r\n      resulting, provided there be a proper stowage. If this, however,\r\n      has not been strictly attended to, in the first of these heavy\r\n      lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the side of the\r\n      vessel which lies upon the water, and, being thus prevented from\r\n      regaining her equilibrium, as she would otherwise necessarily do,\r\n      she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down. It is not\r\n      too much to say that at least one-half of the instances in which\r\n      vessels have foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to\r\n      a shifting of cargo or of ballast.\r\n\r\n      When a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board, the whole,\r\n      after being first stowed as compactly as may be, should be\r\n      covered with a layer of stout shifting-boards, extending\r\n      completely across the vessel. Upon these boards strong temporary\r\n      stanchions should be erected, reaching to the timbers above, and\r\n      thus securing every thing in its place. In cargoes consisting of\r\n      grain, or any similar matter, additional precautions are\r\n      requisite. A hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port\r\n      will be found not more than three fourths full upon reaching its\r\n      destination—this, too, although the freight, when measured bushel\r\n      by bushel by the consignee, will overrun by a vast deal (on\r\n      account of the swelling of the grain) the quantity consigned.\r\n      This result is occasioned by settling during the voyage, and is\r\n      the more perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the\r\n      weather experienced. If grain loosely thrown in a vessel, then,\r\n      is ever so well secured by shifting-boards and stanchions, it\r\n      will be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring\r\n      about the most distressing calamities. To prevent these, every\r\n      method should be employed before leaving port to settle the cargo\r\n      as much as possible; and for this there are many contrivances,\r\n      among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into the\r\n      grain. Even after all this is done, and unusual pains taken to\r\n      secure the shifting-boards, no seaman who knows what he is about\r\n      will feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a\r\n      cargo of grain on board, and, least of all, with a partial cargo.\r\n      Yet there are hundreds of our coasting vessels, and, it is\r\n      likely, many more from the ports of Europe, which sail daily with\r\n      partial cargoes, even of the most dangerous species, and without\r\n      any precaution whatever. The wonder is that no more accidents\r\n      occur than do actually happen. A lamentable instance of this\r\n      heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of Captain Joel\r\n      Rice of the schooner Firefly, which sailed from Richmond,\r\n      Virginia, to Madeira, with a cargo of corn, in the year 1825. The\r\n      captain had gone many voyages without serious accident, although\r\n      he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his\r\n      stowage, more than to secure it in the ordinary manner. He had\r\n      never before sailed with a cargo of grain, and on this occasion\r\n      had the corn thrown on board loosely, when it did not much more\r\n      than half fill the vessel. For the first portion of the voyage he\r\n      met with nothing more than light breezes; but when within a day’s\r\n      sail of Madeira there came on a strong gale from the N. N. E.\r\n      which forced him to lie-to. He brought the schooner to the wind\r\n      under a double-reefed foresail alone, when she rode as well as\r\n      any vessel could be expected to do, and shipped not a drop of\r\n      water. Toward night the gale somewhat abated, and she rolled with\r\n      more unsteadiness than before, but still did very well, until a\r\n      heavy lurch threw her upon her beam-ends to starboard. The corn\r\n      was then heard to shift bodily, the force of the movement\r\n      bursting open the main hatchway. The vessel went down like a\r\n      shot. This happened within hail of a small sloop from Madeira,\r\n      which picked up one of the crew (the only person saved), and\r\n      which rode out the gale in perfect security, as indeed a jolly\r\n      boat might have done under proper management.\r\n\r\n      The stowage on board the Grampus was most clumsily done, if\r\n      stowage that could be called which was little better than a\r\n      promiscuous huddling together of oil-casks {*1} and ship\r\n      furniture. I have already spoken of the condition of articles in\r\n      the hold. On the orlop deck there was space enough for my body\r\n      (as I have stated) between the oil-casks and the upper deck; a\r\n      space was left open around the main hatchway; and several other\r\n      large spaces were left in the stowage. Near the hole cut through\r\n      the bulkhead by Augustus there was room enough for an entire\r\n      cask, and in this space I found myself comfortably situated for\r\n      the present.\r\n\r\n      By the time my friend had got safely into the berth, and\r\n      readjusted his handcuffs and the rope, it was broad daylight. We\r\n      had made a narrow escape indeed; for scarcely had he arranged all\r\n      matters, when the mate came below, with Dirk Peters and the cook.\r\n      They talked for some time about the vessel from the Cape Verds,\r\n      and seemed to be excessively anxious for her appearance. At\r\n      length the cook came to the berth in which Augustus was lying,\r\n      and seated himself in it near the head. I could see and hear\r\n      every thing from my hiding-place, for the piece cut out had not\r\n      been put back, and I was in momentary expectation that the negro\r\n      would fall against the pea-jacket, which was hung up to conceal\r\n      the aperture, in which case all would have been discovered, and\r\n      our lives would, no doubt, have been instantly sacrificed. Our\r\n      good fortune prevailed, however; and although he frequently\r\n      touched it as the vessel rolled, he never pressed against it\r\n      sufficiently to bring about a discovery. The bottom of the jacket\r\n      had been carefully fastened to the bulkhead, so that the hole\r\n      might not be seen by its swinging to one side. All this time\r\n      Tiger was lying in the foot of the berth, and appeared to have\r\n      recovered in some measure his faculties, for I could see him\r\n      occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath.\r\n\r\n      After a few minutes the mate and cook went above, leaving Dirk\r\n      Peters behind, who, as soon as they were gone, came and sat\r\n      himself down in the place just occupied by the mate. He began to\r\n      talk very sociably with Augustus, and we could now see that the\r\n      greater part of his apparent intoxication, while the two others\r\n      were with him, was a feint. He answered all my companion’s\r\n      questions with perfect freedom; told him that he had no doubt of\r\n      his father’s having been picked up, as there were no less than\r\n      five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he was cut\r\n      adrift; and used other language of a consolatory nature, which\r\n      occasioned me no less surprise than pleasure. Indeed, I began to\r\n      entertain hopes, that through the instrumentality of Peters we\r\n      might be finally enabled to regain possession of the brig, and\r\n      this idea I mentioned to Augustus as soon as I found an\r\n      opportunity. He thought the matter possible, but urged the\r\n      necessity of the greatest caution in making the attempt, as the\r\n      conduct of the hybrid appeared to be instigated by the most\r\n      arbitrary caprice alone; and, indeed, it was difficult to say if\r\n      he was at any moment of sound mind. Peters went upon deck in\r\n      about an hour, and did not return again until noon, when he\r\n      brought Augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding. Of\r\n      this, when we were left alone, I partook heartily, without\r\n      returning through the hole. No one else came down into the\r\n      forecastle during the day, and at night, I got into Augustus’\r\n      berth, where I slept soundly and sweetly until nearly daybreak,\r\n      when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon deck, and I regained\r\n      my hiding-place as quickly as possible. When the day was fully\r\n      broke, we found that Tiger had recovered his strength almost\r\n      entirely, and gave no indications of hydrophobia, drinking a\r\n      little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness.\r\n      During the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite.\r\n      His strange conduct had been brought on, no doubt, by the\r\n      deleterious quality of the air of the hold, and had no connexion\r\n      with canine madness. I could not sufficiently rejoice that I had\r\n      persisted in bringing him with me from the box. This day was the\r\n      thirtieth of June, and the thirteenth since the Grampus made sail\r\n      from Nantucket.\r\n\r\n      On the second of July the mate came below drunk as usual, and in\r\n      an excessively good-humor. He came to Augustus’s berth, and,\r\n      giving him a slap on the back, asked him if he thought he could\r\n      behave himself if he let him loose, and whether he would promise\r\n      not to be going into the cabin again. To this, of course, my\r\n      friend answered in the affirmative, when the ruffian set him at\r\n      liberty, after making him drink from a flask of rum which he drew\r\n      from his coat-pocket. Both now went on deck, and I did not see\r\n      Augustus for about three hours. He then came below with the good\r\n      news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he\r\n      pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast, and that he had been\r\n      ordered to sleep, as usual, in the forecastle. He brought me,\r\n      too, a good dinner, and a plentiful supply of water. The brig was\r\n      still cruising for the vessel from the Cape Verds, and a sail was\r\n      now in sight, which was thought to be the one in question. As the\r\n      events of the ensuing eight days were of little importance, and\r\n      had no direct bearing upon the main incidents of my narrative, I\r\n      will here throw them into the form of a journal, as I do not wish\r\n      to omit them altogether.\r\n\r\n      July 3. Augustus furnished me with three blankets, with which I\r\n      contrived a comfortable bed in my hiding-place. No one came\r\n      below, except my companion, during the day. Tiger took his\r\n      station in the berth just by the aperture, and slept heavily, as\r\n      if not yet entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness.\r\n      Toward night a flaw of wind struck the brig before sail could be\r\n      taken in, and very nearly capsized her. The puff died away\r\n      immediately, however, and no damage was done beyond the splitting\r\n      of the foretopsail. Dirk Peters treated Augustus all this day\r\n      with great kindness and entered into a long conversation with him\r\n      respecting the Pacific Ocean, and the islands he had visited in\r\n      that region. He asked him whether he would not like to go with\r\n      the mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those\r\n      quarters, and said that the men were gradually coming over to the\r\n      mate’s views. To this Augustus thought it best to reply that he\r\n      would be glad to go on such an adventure, since nothing better\r\n      could be done, and that any thing was preferable to a piratical\r\n      life.\r\n\r\n      July 4th. The vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from\r\n      Liverpool, and was allowed to pass unmolested. Augustus spent\r\n      most of his time on deck, with a view of obtaining all the\r\n      information in his power respecting the intentions of the\r\n      mutineers. They had frequent and violent quarrels among\r\n      themselves, in one of which a harpooner, Jim Bonner, was thrown\r\n      overboard. The party of the mate was gaining ground. Jim Bonner\r\n      belonged to the cook’s gang, of which Peters was a partisan.\r\n\r\n      July 5th. About daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the\r\n      west, which at noon freshened into a gale, so that the brig could\r\n      carry nothing more than her trysail and foresail. In taking in\r\n      the foretopsail, Simms, one of the common hands, and belonging\r\n      also to the cook’s gang, fell overboard, being very much in\r\n      liquor, and was drowned—no attempt being made to save him. The\r\n      whole number of persons on board was now thirteen, to wit: Dirk\r\n      Peters; Seymour, the black cook; Jones, Greely, Hartman Rogers\r\n      and William Allen, all of the cook’s party; the mate, whose name\r\n      I never learned; Absalom Hicks, Wilson, John Hunty Richard\r\n      Parker, of the mate’s party;—besides Augustus and myself.\r\n\r\n      July 6th. The gale lasted all this day, blowing in heavy squalls,\r\n      accompanied with rain. The brig took in a good deal of water\r\n      through her seams, and one of the pumps was kept continually\r\n      going, Augustus being forced to take his turn. Just at twilight a\r\n      large ship passed close by us, without having been discovered\r\n      until within hail. The ship was supposed to be the one for which\r\n      the mutineers were on the lookout. The mate hailed her, but the\r\n      reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale. At eleven, a sea\r\n      was shipped amidships, which tore away a great portion of the\r\n      larboard bulwarks, and did some other slight damage. Toward\r\n      morning the weather moderated, and at sunrise there was very\r\n      little wind.\r\n\r\n      July 7th. There was a heavy swell running all this day, during\r\n      which the brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many\r\n      articles broke loose in the hold, as I could hear distinctly from\r\n      my hiding-place. I suffered a great deal from sea-sickness.\r\n      Peters had a long conversation this day with Augustus, and told\r\n      him that two of his gang, Greely and Allen, had gone over to the\r\n      mate, and were resolved to turn pirates. He put several questions\r\n      to Augustus which he did not then exactly understand. During a\r\n      part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel; and little\r\n      could be done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by the brig's\r\n      straining, and taking in the water through her seams. A sail was\r\n      thrummed, and got under the bows, which aided us in some measure,\r\n      so that we began to gain upon the leak.\r\n\r\n      July 8th. A light breeze sprang up at sunrise from the eastward,\r\n      when the mate headed the brig to the southwest, with the\r\n      intention of making some of the West India islands in pursuance\r\n      of his piratical designs. No opposition was made by Peters or the\r\n      cook—at least none in the hearing of Augustus. All idea of taking\r\n      the vessel from the Cape Verds was abandoned. The leak was now\r\n      easily kept under by one pump going every three quarters of an\r\n      hour. The sail was drawn from beneath the bows. Spoke two small\r\n      schooners during the day.\r\n\r\n      July 9th. Fine weather. All hands employed in repairing bulwarks.\r\n      Peters had again a long conversation with Augustus, and spoke\r\n      more plainly than he had done heretofore. He said nothing should\r\n      induce him to come into the mate’s views, and even hinted his\r\n      intention of taking the brig out of his hands. He asked my friend\r\n      if he could depend upon his aid in such case, to which Augustus\r\n      said, “Yes,” without hesitation. Peters then said he would sound\r\n      the others of his party upon the subject, and went away. During\r\n      the remainder of the day Augustus had no opportunity of speaking\r\n      with him privately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7\r\n\r\n\r\n      July 10. Spoke a brig from Rio, bound to Norfolk. Weather hazy,\r\n      with a light baffling wind from the eastward. To-day Hartman\r\n      Rogers died, having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after\r\n      drinking a glass of grog. This man was of the cook’s party, and\r\n      one upon whom Peters placed his main reliance. He told Augustus\r\n      that he believed the mate had poisoned him, and that he expected,\r\n      if he did not be on the look-out, his own turn would come\r\n      shortly. There were now only himself, Jones, and the cook\r\n      belonging to his own gang—on the other side there were five. He\r\n      had spoken to Jones about taking the command from the mate; but\r\n      the project having been coolly received, he had been deterred\r\n      from pressing the matter any further, or from saying any thing to\r\n      the cook. It was well, as it happened, that he was so prudent,\r\n      for in the afternoon the cook expressed his determination of\r\n      siding with the mate, and went over formally to that party; while\r\n      Jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with Peters, and hinted\r\n      that he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation. There\r\n      was now, evidently, no time to be lost, and Peters expressed his\r\n      determination of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards,\r\n      provided Augustus would lend him his aid. My friend at once\r\n      assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that\r\n      purpose, and, thinking the opportunity a favourable one, made\r\n      known the fact of my being on board. At this the hybrid was not\r\n      more astonished than delighted, as he had no reliance whatever\r\n      upon Jones, whom he already considered as belonging to the party\r\n      of the mate. They went below immediately, when Augustus called to\r\n      me by name, and Peters and myself were soon made acquainted. It\r\n      was agreed that we should attempt to retake the vessel upon the\r\n      first good opportunity, leaving Jones altogether out of our\r\n      councils. In the event of success, we were to run the brig into\r\n      the first port that offered, and deliver her up. The desertion of\r\n      his party had frustrated Peters’ design of going into the\r\n      Pacific—an adventure which could not be accomplished without a\r\n      crew, and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial,\r\n      on the score of insanity (which he solemnly avowed had actuated\r\n      him in lending his aid to the mutiny), or upon obtaining a\r\n      pardon, if found guilty, through the representations of Augustus\r\n      and myself. Our deliberations were interrupted for the present by\r\n      the cry of, “All hands take in sail,” and Peters and Augustus ran\r\n      up on deck.\r\n\r\n      As usual, the crew were nearly all drunk; and, before sail could\r\n      be properly taken in, a violent squall laid the brig on her\r\n      beam-ends. By keeping her away, however, she righted, having\r\n      shipped a good deal of water. Scarcely was everything secure,\r\n      when another squall took the vessel, and immediately afterward\r\n      another—no damage being done. There was every appearance of a\r\n      gale of wind, which, indeed, shortly came on, with great fury,\r\n      from the northward and westward. All was made as snug as\r\n      possible, and we laid-to, as usual, under a close-reefed\r\n      foresail. As night drew on, the wind increased in violence, with\r\n      a remarkably heavy sea. Peters now came into the forecastle with\r\n      Augustus, and we resumed our deliberations.\r\n\r\n      We agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the\r\n      present for carrying our designs into effect, as an attempt at\r\n      such a moment would never be anticipated. As the brig was snugly\r\n      laid-to, there would be no necessity of manoeuvring her until\r\n      good weather, when, if we succeeded in our attempt, we might\r\n      liberate one, or perhaps two of the men, to aid us in taking her\r\n      into port. The main difficulty was the great disproportion in our\r\n      forces. There were only three of us, and in the cabin there were\r\n      nine. All the arms on board, too, were in their possession, with\r\n      the exception of a pair of small pistols which Peters had\r\n      concealed about his person, and the large seaman’s knife which he\r\n      always wore in the waistband of his pantaloons. From certain\r\n      indications, too—such, for example, as there being no such thing\r\n      as an axe or a handspike lying in their customary places—we began\r\n      to fear that the mate had his suspicions, at least in regard to\r\n      Peters, and that he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid\r\n      of him. It was clear, indeed, that what we should determine to do\r\n      could not be done too soon. Still the odds were too much against\r\n      us to allow of our proceeding without the greatest caution.\r\n\r\n      Peters proposed that he should go up on deck, and enter into\r\n      conversation with the watch (Allen), when he would be able to\r\n      throw him into the sea without trouble, and without making any\r\n      disturbance, by seizing a good opportunity, that Augustus and\r\n      myself should then come up, and endeavour to provide ourselves\r\n      with some kind of weapons from the deck, and that we should then\r\n      make a rush together, and secure the companion-way before any\r\n      opposition could be offered. I objected to this, because I could\r\n      not believe that the mate (who was a cunning fellow in all\r\n      matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudices) would\r\n      suffer himself to be so easily entrapped. The very fact of there\r\n      being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was\r\n      upon the alert,—it not being usual except in vessels where\r\n      discipline is most rigidly enforced, to station a watch on deck\r\n      when a vessel is lying-to in a gale of wind. As I address myself\r\n      principally, if not altogether, to persons who have never been to\r\n      sea, it may be as well to state the exact condition of a vessel\r\n      under such circumstances. Lying-to, or, in sea-parlance,\r\n      “laying-to,” is a measure resorted to for various purposes, and\r\n      effected in various manners. In moderate weather it is frequently\r\n      done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a stand-still,\r\n      to wait for another vessel or any similar object. If the vessel\r\n      which lies-to is under full sail, the manoeuvre is usually\r\n      accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails, so as\r\n      to let the wind take them aback, when she becomes stationary. But\r\n      we are now speaking of lying-to in a gale of wind. This is done\r\n      when the wind is ahead, and too violent to admit of carrying sail\r\n      without danger of capsizing; and sometimes even when the wind is\r\n      fair, but the sea too heavy for the vessel to be put before it.\r\n      If a vessel be suffered to scud before the wind in a very heavy\r\n      sea, much damage is usually done her by the shipping of water\r\n      over her stern, and sometimes by the violent plunges she makes\r\n      forward. This manoeuvre, then, is seldom resorted to in such\r\n      case, unless through necessity. When the vessel is in a leaky\r\n      condition she is often put before the wind even in the heaviest\r\n      seas; for, when lying-to, her seams are sure to be greatly opened\r\n      by her violent straining, and it is not so much the case when\r\n      scudding. Often, too, it becomes necessary to scud a vessel,\r\n      either when the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in\r\n      pieces the sail which is employed with a view of bringing her\r\n      head to the wind, or when, through the false modelling of the\r\n      frame or other causes, this main object cannot be effected.\r\n\r\n      Vessels in a gale of wind are laid-to in different manners,\r\n      according to their peculiar construction. Some lie-to best under\r\n      a foresail, and this, I believe, is the sail most usually\r\n      employed. Large square-rigged vessels have sails for the express\r\n      purpose, called storm-staysails. But the jib is occasionally\r\n      employed by itself,—sometimes the jib and foresail, or a\r\n      double-reefed foresail, and not unfrequently the after-sails, are\r\n      made use of. Foretopsails are very often found to answer the\r\n      purpose better than any other species of sail. The Grampus was\r\n      generally laid-to under a close-reefed foresail.\r\n\r\n      When a vessel is to be laid-to, her head is brought up to the\r\n      wind just so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when\r\n      hauled flat aft, that is, when brought diagonally across the\r\n      vessel. This being done, the bows point within a few degrees of\r\n      the direction from which the wind issues, and the windward bow of\r\n      course receives the shock of the waves. In this situation a good\r\n      vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind without shipping a\r\n      drop of water, and without any further attention being requisite\r\n      on the part of the crew. The helm is usually lashed down, but\r\n      this is altogether unnecessary (except on account of the noise it\r\n      makes when loose), for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel\r\n      when lying-to. Indeed, the helm had far better be left loose than\r\n      lashed very fast, for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy\r\n      seas if there be no room for the helm to play. As long as the\r\n      sail holds, a well modelled vessel will maintain her situation,\r\n      and ride every sea, as if instinct with life and reason. If the\r\n      violence of the wind, however, should tear the sail into pieces\r\n      (a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under\r\n      ordinary circumstances), there is then imminent danger. The\r\n      vessel falls off from the wind, and, coming broadside to the sea,\r\n      is completely at its mercy: the only resource in this case is to\r\n      put her quietly before the wind, letting her scud until some\r\n      other sail can be set. Some vessels will lie-to under no sail\r\n      whatever, but such are not to be trusted at sea.\r\n\r\n      But to return from this digression. It had never been customary\r\n      with the mate to have any watch on deck when lying-to in a gale\r\n      of wind, and the fact that he had now one, coupled with the\r\n      circumstance of the missing axes and handspikes, fully convinced\r\n      us that the crew were too well on the watch to be taken by\r\n      surprise in the manner Peters had suggested. Something, however,\r\n      was to be done, and that with as little delay as practicable, for\r\n      there could be no doubt that a suspicion having been once\r\n      entertained against Peters, he would be sacrificed upon the\r\n      earliest occasion, and one would certainly be either found or\r\n      made upon the breaking of the gale.\r\n\r\n      Augustus now suggested that if Peters could contrive to remove,\r\n      under any pretext, the piece of chain-cable which lay over the\r\n      trap in the stateroom, we might possibly be able to come upon\r\n      them unawares by means of the hold; but a little reflection\r\n      convinced us that the vessel rolled and pitched too violently for\r\n      any attempt of that nature.\r\n\r\n      By good fortune I at length hit upon the idea of working upon the\r\n      superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate. It will\r\n      be remembered that one of the crew, Hartman Rogers, had died\r\n      during the morning, having been attacked two days before with\r\n      spasms after drinking some spirits and water. Peters had\r\n      expressed to us his opinion that this man had been poisoned by\r\n      the mate, and for this belief he had reasons, so he said, which\r\n      were incontrovertible, but which he could not be prevailed upon\r\n      to explain to us—this wayward refusal being only in keeping with\r\n      other points of his singular character. But whether or not he had\r\n      any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves,\r\n      we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion, and determined\r\n      to act accordingly.\r\n\r\n      Rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon, in violent\r\n      convulsions; and the corpse presented in a few minutes after\r\n      death one of the most horrid and loathsome spectacles I ever\r\n      remember to have seen. The stomach was swollen immensely, like\r\n      that of a man who has been drowned and lain under water for many\r\n      weeks. The hands were in the same condition, while the face was\r\n      shrunken, shrivelled, and of a chalky whiteness, except where\r\n      relieved by two or three glaring red blotches like those\r\n      occasioned by the erysipelas: one of these blotches extended\r\n      diagonally across the face, completely covering up an eye as if\r\n      with a band of red velvet. In this disgusting condition the body\r\n      had been brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown\r\n      overboard, when the mate getting a glimpse of it (for he now saw\r\n      it for the first time), and being either touched with remorse for\r\n      his crime or struck with terror at so horrible a sight, ordered\r\n      the men to sew the body up in its hammock, and allow it the usual\r\n      rites of sea-burial. Having given these directions, he went\r\n      below, as if to avoid any further sight of his victim. While\r\n      preparations were making to obey his orders, the gale came on\r\n      with great fury, and the design was abandoned for the present.\r\n      The corpse, left to itself, was washed into the larboard\r\n      scuppers, where it still lay at the time of which I speak,\r\n      floundering about with the furious lurches of the brig.\r\n\r\n      Having arranged our plan, we set about putting it in execution as\r\n      speedily as possible. Peters went upon deck, and, as he had\r\n      anticipated, was immediately accosted by Allen, who appeared to\r\n      be stationed more as a watch upon the forecastle than for any\r\n      other purpose. The fate of this villain, however, was speedily\r\n      and silently decided; for Peters, approaching him in a careless\r\n      manner, as if about to address him, seized him by the throat,\r\n      and, before he could utter a single cry, tossed him over the\r\n      bulwarks. He then called to us, and we came up. Our first\r\n      precaution was to look about for something with which to arm\r\n      ourselves, and in doing this we had to proceed with great care,\r\n      for it was impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding\r\n      fast, and violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge\r\n      forward. It was indispensable, too, that we should be quick in\r\n      our operations, for every minute we expected the mate to be up to\r\n      set the pumps going, as it was evident the brig must be taking in\r\n      water very fast. After searching about for some time, we could\r\n      find nothing more fit for our purpose than the two pump-handles,\r\n      one of which Augustus took, and I the other. Having secured\r\n      these, we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and dropped the\r\n      body overboard. Peters and myself then went below, leaving\r\n      Augustus to watch upon deck, where he took his station just where\r\n      Allen had been placed, and with his back to the cabin\r\n      companionway, so that, if any of the mate's gang should come up,\r\n      he might suppose it was the watch.\r\n\r\n      As soon as I got below I commenced disguising myself so as to\r\n      represent the corpse of Rogers. The shirt which we had taken from\r\n      the body aided us very much, for it was of singular form and\r\n      character, and easily recognizable—a kind of smock, which the\r\n      deceased wore over his other clothing. It was a blue stockinett,\r\n      with large white stripes running across. Having put this on, I\r\n      proceeded to equip myself with a false stomach, in imitation of\r\n      the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse. This was soon\r\n      effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes. I then gave\r\n      the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white\r\n      woollen mittens, and filling them in with any kind of rags that\r\n      offered themselves. Peters then arranged my face, first rubbing\r\n      it well over with white chalk, and afterward blotching it with\r\n      blood, which he took from a cut in his finger. The streak across\r\n      the eye was not forgotten and presented a most shocking\r\n      appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8\r\n\r\n\r\n      As I viewed myself in a fragment of looking-glass which hung up\r\n      in the cabin, and by the dim light of a kind of battle-lantern, I\r\n      was so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance, and\r\n      at the recollection of the terrific reality which I was thus\r\n      representing, that I was seized with a violent tremour, and could\r\n      scarcely summon resolution to go on with my part. It was\r\n      necessary, however, to act with decision, and Peters and myself\r\n      went upon deck.\r\n\r\n      We there found everything safe, and, keeping close to the\r\n      bulwarks, the three of us crept to the cabin companion-way. It\r\n      was only partially closed, precautions having been taken to\r\n      prevent its being suddenly pushed to from without, by means of\r\n      placing billets of wood on the upper step so as to interfere with\r\n      the shutting. We found no difficulty in getting a full view of\r\n      the interior of the cabin through the cracks where the hinges\r\n      were placed. It now proved to have been very fortunate for us\r\n      that we had not attempted to take them by surprise, for they were\r\n      evidently on the alert. Only one was asleep, and he lying just at\r\n      the foot of the companion-ladder, with a musket by his side. The\r\n      rest were seated on several mattresses, which had been taken from\r\n      the berths and thrown on the floor. They were engaged in earnest\r\n      conversation; and although they had been carousing, as appeared\r\n      from two empty jugs, with some tin tumblers which lay about, they\r\n      were not as much intoxicated as usual. All had knives, one or two\r\n      of them pistols, and a great many muskets were lying in a berth\r\n      close at hand.\r\n\r\n      We listened to their conversation for some time before we could\r\n      make up our minds how to act, having as yet resolved on nothing\r\n      determinate, except that we would attempt to paralyze their\r\n      exertions, when we should attack them, by means of the apparition\r\n      of Rogers. They were discussing their piratical plans, in which\r\n      all we could hear distinctly was, that they would unite with the\r\n      crew of a schooner _Hornet_, and, if possible, get the schooner\r\n      herself into their possession preparatory to some attempt on a\r\n      large scale, the particulars of which could not be made out by\r\n      either of us.\r\n\r\n      One of the men spoke of Peters, when the mate replied to him in a\r\n      low voice which could not be distinguished, and afterward added\r\n      more loudly, that “he could not understand his being so much\r\n      forward with the captain’s brat in the forecastle, and he thought\r\n      the sooner both of them were overboard the better.” To this no\r\n      answer was made, but we could easily perceive that the hint was\r\n      well received by the whole party, and more particularly by Jones.\r\n      At this period I was excessively agitated, the more so as I could\r\n      see that neither Augustus nor Peters could determine how to act.\r\n      I made up my mind, however, to sell my life as dearly as\r\n      possible, and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any feelings\r\n      of trepidation.\r\n\r\n      The tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the\r\n      rigging, and the washing of the sea over the deck, prevented us\r\n      from hearing what was said, except during momentary lulls. In one\r\n      of these, we all distinctly heard the mate tell one of the men to\r\n      “go forward, have an eye upon them, for he wanted no such secret\r\n      doings on board the brig.” It was well for us that the pitching\r\n      of the vessel at this moment was so violent as to prevent this\r\n      order from being carried into instant execution. The cook got up\r\n      from his mattress to go for us, when a tremendous lurch, which I\r\n      thought would carry away the masts, threw him headlong against\r\n      one of the larboard stateroom doors, bursting it open, and\r\n      creating a good deal of other confusion. Luckily, neither of our\r\n      party was thrown from his position, and we had time to make a\r\n      precipitate retreat to the forecastle, and arrange a hurried plan\r\n      of action before the messenger made his appearance, or rather\r\n      before he put his head out of the companion-hatch, for he did not\r\n      come on deck. From this station he could not notice the absence\r\n      of Allen, and he accordingly bawled out, as if to him, repeating\r\n      the orders of the mate. Peters cried out, “Ay, ay,” in a\r\n      disguised voice, and the cook immediately went below, without\r\n      entertaining a suspicion that all was not right.\r\n\r\n      My two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the\r\n      cabin, Peters closing the door after him in the same manner he\r\n      had found it. The mate received them with feigned cordiality, and\r\n      told Augustus that, since he had behaved himself so well of late,\r\n      he might take up his quarters in the cabin and be one of them for\r\n      the future. He then poured him out a tumbler half full of rum,\r\n      and made him drink it. All this I saw and heard, for I followed\r\n      my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut, and took up\r\n      my old point of observation. I had brought with me the two\r\n      pump-handles, one of which I secured near the companion-way, to\r\n      be ready for use when required.\r\n\r\n      I now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good\r\n      view of all that was passing within, and endeavoured to nerve\r\n      myself to the task of descending among the mutineers when Peters\r\n      should make a signal to me, as agreed upon. Presently he\r\n      contrived to turn the conversation upon the bloody deeds of the\r\n      mutiny, and by degrees led the men to talk of the thousand\r\n      superstitions which are so universally current among seamen. I\r\n      could not make out all that was said, but I could plainly see the\r\n      effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present.\r\n      The mate was evidently much agitated, and presently, when some\r\n      one mentioned the terrific appearance of Rogers’ corpse, I\r\n      thought he was upon the point of swooning. Peters now asked him\r\n      if he did not think it would be better to have the body thrown\r\n      overboard at once as it was too horrible a sight to see it\r\n      floundering about in the scuppers. At this the villain absolutely\r\n      gasped for breath, and turned his head slowly round upon his\r\n      companions, as if imploring some one to go up and perform the\r\n      task. No one, however, stirred, and it was quite evident that the\r\n      whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous\r\n      excitement. Peters now made me the signal. I immediately threw\r\n      open the door of the companion-way, and, descending, without\r\n      uttering a syllable, stood erect in the midst of the party.\r\n\r\n      The intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at\r\n      all to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken\r\n      into consideration. Usually, in cases of a similar nature, there\r\n      is left in the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as\r\n      to the reality of the vision before his eyes; a degree of hope,\r\n      however feeble, that he is the victim of chicanery, and that the\r\n      apparition is not actually a visitant from the old world of\r\n      shadows. It is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt\r\n      have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation, and that\r\n      the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about, is\r\n      to be attributed, even in the cases most in point, and where most\r\n      suffering has been experienced, more to a kind of anticipative\r\n      horror, lest the apparition might possibly be real, than to an\r\n      unwavering belief in its reality. But, in the present instance,\r\n      it will be seen immediately, that in the minds of the mutineers\r\n      there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a\r\n      doubt that the apparition of Rogers was indeed a revivification\r\n      of his disgusting corpse, or at least its spiritual image. The\r\n      isolated situation of the brig, with its entire inaccessibility\r\n      on account of the gale, confined the apparently possible means of\r\n      deception within such narrow and definite limits, that they must\r\n      have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance.\r\n      They had now been at sea twenty-four days, without holding more\r\n      than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever. The whole\r\n      of the crew, too—at least all whom they had the most remote\r\n      reason for suspecting to be on board—were assembled in the cabin,\r\n      with the exception of Allen, the watch; and his gigantic stature\r\n      (he was six feet six inches high) was too familiar in their eyes\r\n      to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to\r\n      enter their minds even for an instant. Add to these\r\n      considerations the awe-inspiring nature of the tempest, and that\r\n      of the conversation brought about by Peters; the deep impression\r\n      which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse had made in the\r\n      morning upon the imaginations of the men; the excellence of the\r\n      imitation in my person, and the uncertain and wavering light in\r\n      which they beheld me, as the glare of the cabin lantern, swinging\r\n      violently to and fro, fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure,\r\n      and there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even\r\n      more than the entire effect which we had anticipated. The mate\r\n      sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying, and, without\r\n      uttering a syllable, fell back, stone dead, upon the cabin floor,\r\n      and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the\r\n      brig. Of the remaining seven, there were but three who had at\r\n      first any degree of presence of mind. The four others sat for\r\n      some time rooted apparently to the floor, the most pitiable\r\n      objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered. The\r\n      only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook, John\r\n      Hunt, and Richard Parker; but they made but a feeble and\r\n      irresolute defence. The two former were shot instantly by Peters,\r\n      and I felled Parker with a blow on the head from the pump-handle\r\n      which I had brought with me. In the meantime, Augustus seized one\r\n      of the muskets lying on the floor and shot another mutineer\r\n      Wilson through the breast. There were now but three remaining;\r\n      but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy, and\r\n      perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon\r\n      them, for they fought with great resolution and fury, and, but\r\n      for the immense muscular strength of Peters, might have\r\n      ultimately got the better of us. These three men were—Jones,\r\n      Greely, and Absolom Hicks. Jones had thrown Augustus to the\r\n      floor, stabbed him in several places along the right arm, and\r\n      would no doubt have soon dispatched him (as neither Peters nor\r\n      myself could immediately get rid of our own antagonists), had it\r\n      not been for the timely aid of a friend, upon whose assistance\r\n      we, surely, had never depended. This friend was no other than\r\n      Tiger. With a low growl, he bounded into the cabin, at a most\r\n      critical moment for Augustus, and throwing himself upon Jones,\r\n      pinned him to the floor in an instant. My friend, however, was\r\n      now too much injured to render us any aid whatever, and I was so\r\n      encumbered with my disguise that I could do but little. The dog\r\n      would not leave his hold upon the throat of Jones—Peters,\r\n      nevertheless, was far more than a match for the two men who\r\n      remained, and would, no doubt, have dispatched them sooner, had\r\n      it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act, and the\r\n      tremendous lurches of the vessel. Presently he was enabled to get\r\n      hold of a heavy stool, several of which lay about the floor. With\r\n      this he beat out the brains of Greely as he was in the act of\r\n      discharging a musket at me, and immediately afterward a roll of\r\n      the brig throwing him in contact with Hicks, he seized him by the\r\n      throat, and, by dint of sheer strength, strangled him\r\n      instantaneously. Thus, in far less time than I have taken to tell\r\n      it, we found ourselves masters of the brig.\r\n\r\n      The only person of our opponents who was left alive was Richard\r\n      Parker. This man, it will be remembered, I had knocked down with\r\n      a blow from the pump-handle at the commencement of the attack. He\r\n      now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom; but,\r\n      upon Peters touching him with his foot, he spoke, and entreated\r\n      for mercy. His head was only slightly cut, and otherwise he had\r\n      received no injury, having been merely stunned by the blow. He\r\n      now got up, and, for the present, we secured his hands behind his\r\n      back. The dog was still growling over Jones; but, upon\r\n      examination, we found him completely dead, the blood issuing in a\r\n      stream from a deep wound in the throat, inflicted, no doubt, by\r\n      the sharp teeth of the animal.\r\n\r\n      It was now about one o’clock in the morning, and the wind was\r\n      still blowing tremendously. The brig evidently laboured much more\r\n      than usual, and it became absolutely necessary that something\r\n      should be done with a view of easing her in some measure. At\r\n      almost every roll to leeward she shipped a sea, several of which\r\n      came partially down into the cabin during our scuffle, the\r\n      hatchway having been left open by myself when I descended. The\r\n      entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away, as well\r\n      as the caboose, together with the jollyboat from the counter. The\r\n      creaking and working of the mainmast, too, gave indication that\r\n      it was nearly sprung. To make room for more stowage in the\r\n      afterhold, the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks\r\n      (a very reprehensible practice, occasionally resorted to by\r\n      ignorant ship-builders), so that it was in imminent danger of\r\n      working from its step. But, to crown all our difficulties, we\r\n      plummed the well, and found no less than seven feet of water.\r\n\r\n      Leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin, we got to work\r\n      immediately at the pumps—Parker, of course, being set at liberty\r\n      to assist us in the labour. Augustus’s arm was bound up as well\r\n      as we could effect it, and he did what he could, but that was not\r\n      much. However, we found that we could just manage to keep the\r\n      leak from gaining upon us by having one pump constantly going. As\r\n      there were only four of us, this was severe labour; but we\r\n      endeavoured to keep up our spirits, and looked anxiously for\r\n      daybreak, when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away the\r\n      mainmast.\r\n\r\n      In this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue,\r\n      and, when the day at length broke, the gale had neither abated in\r\n      the least, nor were there any signs of its abating. We now\r\n      dragged the bodies on deck and threw them overboard. Our next\r\n      care was to get rid of the mainmast. The necessary preparations\r\n      having been made, Peters cut away at the mast (having found axes\r\n      in the cabin), while the rest of us stood by the stays and\r\n      lanyards. As the brig gave a tremendous lee-lurch, the word was\r\n      given to cut away the weather-lanyards, which being done, the\r\n      whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea, clear of the\r\n      brig, and without doing any material injury. We now found that\r\n      the vessel did not labour quite as much as before, but our\r\n      situation was still exceedingly precarious, and in spite of the\r\n      utmost exertions, we could not gain upon the leak without the aid\r\n      of both pumps. The little assistance which Augustus could render\r\n      us was not really of any importance. To add to our distress, a\r\n      heavy sea, striking the brig to the windward, threw her off\r\n      several points from the wind, and, before she could regain her\r\n      position, another broke completely over her, and hurled her full\r\n      upon her beam-ends. The ballast now shifted in a mass to leeward\r\n      (the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for some\r\n      time), and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us\r\n      from capsizing. Presently, however, we partially righted; but the\r\n      ballast still retaining its place to larboard, we lay so much\r\n      along that it was useless to think of working the pumps, which\r\n      indeed we could not have done much longer in any case, as our\r\n      hands were entirely raw with the excessive labour we had\r\n      undergone, and were bleeding in the most horrible manner.\r\n\r\n      Contrary to Parker’s advice, we now proceeded to cut away the\r\n      foremast, and at length accomplished it after much difficulty,\r\n      owing to the position in which we lay. In going overboard the\r\n      wreck took with it the bowsprit, and left us a complete hulk.\r\n\r\n      So far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our\r\n      longboat, which had received no damage from any of the huge seas\r\n      which had come on board. But we had not long to congratulate\r\n      ourselves; for the foremast having gone, and, of course, the\r\n      foresail with it, by which the brig had been steadied, every sea\r\n      now made a complete breach over us, and in five minutes our deck\r\n      was swept from stem to stern, the longboat and starboard bulwarks\r\n      torn off, and even the windlass shattered into fragments. It was,\r\n      indeed, hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable\r\n      condition.\r\n\r\n      At noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale’s\r\n      abating, but in this we were sadly disappointed, for it only\r\n      lulled for a few minutes to blow with redoubled fury. About four\r\n      in the afternoon it was utterly impossible to stand up against\r\n      the violence of the blast; and, as the night closed in upon us, I\r\n      had not a shadow of hope that the vessel would hold together\r\n      until morning.\r\n\r\n      By midnight we had settled very deep in the water, which was now\r\n      up to the orlop deck. The rudder went soon afterward, the sea\r\n      which tore it away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely\r\n      from the water, against which she thumped in her descent with\r\n      such a concussion as would be occasioned by going ashore. We had\r\n      all calculated that the rudder would hold its own to the last, as\r\n      it was unusually strong, being rigged as I have never seen one\r\n      rigged either before or since. Down its main timber there ran a\r\n      succession of stout iron hooks, and others in the same manner\r\n      down the stern-post. Through these hooks there extended a very\r\n      thick wrought-iron rod, the rudder being thus held to the\r\n      stern-post and swinging freely on the rod. The tremendous force\r\n      of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact, that\r\n      the hooks in the stern-post, which ran entirely through it, being\r\n      clinched on the inside, were drawn every one of them completely\r\n      out of the solid wood.\r\n\r\n      We had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this\r\n      shock, when one of the most tremendous waves I had then ever\r\n      known broke right on board of us, sweeping the companion-way\r\n      clear off, bursting in the hatchways, and filling every inch of\r\n      the vessel with water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9\r\n\r\n\r\n      Luckily, just before night, all four of us had lashed ourselves\r\n      firmly to the fragments of the windlass, lying in this manner as\r\n      flat upon the deck as possible. This precaution alone saved us\r\n      from destruction. As it was, we were all more or less stunned by\r\n      the immense weight of water which tumbled upon us, and which did\r\n      not roll from above us until we were nearly exhausted. As soon as\r\n      I could recover breath, I called aloud to my companions. Augustus\r\n      alone replied, saying: “It is all over with us, and may God have\r\n      mercy upon our souls!” By-and-by both the others were enabled to\r\n      speak, when they exhorted us to take courage, as there was still\r\n      hope; it being impossible, from the nature of the cargo, that the\r\n      brig could go down, and there being every chance that the gale\r\n      would blow over by the morning. These words inspired me with new\r\n      life; for, strange as it may seem, although it was obvious that a\r\n      vessel with a cargo of empty oil-casks would not sink, I had been\r\n      hitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this\r\n      consideration altogether; and the danger which I had for some\r\n      time regarded as the most imminent was that of foundering. As\r\n      hope revived within me, I made use of every opportunity to\r\n      strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains of the\r\n      windlass, and in this occupation I soon discovered that my\r\n      companions were also busy. The night was as dark as it could\r\n      possibly be, and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which\r\n      surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing. Our deck lay\r\n      level with the sea, or rather we were encircled with a towering\r\n      ridge of foam, a portion of which swept over us every instant. It\r\n      is not too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of the\r\n      water more than one second in three. Although we lay close\r\n      together, no one of us could see the other, or, indeed, any\r\n      portion of the brig itself, upon which we were so tempestuously\r\n      hurled about. At intervals we called one to the other, thus\r\n      endeavouring to keep alive hope, and render consolation and\r\n      encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it. The\r\n      feeble condition of Augustus made him an object of solicitude\r\n      with us all; and as, from the lacerated condition of his right\r\n      arm, it must have been impossible for him to secure his lashings\r\n      with any degree of firmness, we were in momentary expectation of\r\n      finding that he had gone overboard—yet to render him aid was a\r\n      thing altogether out of the question. Fortunately, his station\r\n      was more secure than that of any of the rest of us; for the upper\r\n      part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered\r\n      windlass, the seas, as they tumbled in upon him, were greatly\r\n      broken in their violence. In any other situation than this (into\r\n      which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed himself\r\n      in a very exposed spot) he must inevitably have perished before\r\n      morning. Owing to the brig’s lying so much along, we were all\r\n      less liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the\r\n      case. The heel, as I have before stated, was to larboard, about\r\n      one half of the deck being constantly under water. The seas,\r\n      therefore, which struck us to starboard were much broken, by the\r\n      vessel’s side, only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on\r\n      our faces; while those which came from larboard being what are\r\n      called back-water seas, and obtaining little hold upon us on\r\n      account of our posture, had not sufficient force to drag us from\r\n      our fastenings.\r\n\r\n      In this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to\r\n      show us more fully the horrors which surrounded us. The brig was\r\n      a mere log, rolling about at the mercy of every wave; the gale\r\n      was upon the increase, if any thing, blowing indeed a complete\r\n      hurricane, and there appeared to us no earthly prospect of\r\n      deliverance. For several hours we held on in silence, expecting\r\n      every moment that our lashings would either give way, that the\r\n      remains of the windlass would go by the board, or that some of\r\n      the huge seas, which roared in every direction around us and\r\n      above us, would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we\r\n      should be drowned before it could regain the surface. By the\r\n      mercy of God, however, we were preserved from these imminent\r\n      dangers, and about midday were cheered by the light of the\r\n      blessed sun. Shortly afterward we could perceive a sensible\r\n      diminution in the force of the wind, when, now for the first time\r\n      since the latter part of the evening before, Augustus spoke,\r\n      asking Peters, who lay closest to him, if he thought there was\r\n      any possibility of our being saved. As no reply was at first made\r\n      to this question, we all concluded that the hybrid had been\r\n      drowned where he lay; but presently, to our great joy, he spoke,\r\n      although very feebly, saying that he was in great pain, being so\r\n      cut by the tightness of his lashings across the stomach, that he\r\n      must either find means of loosening them or perish, as it was\r\n      impossible that he could endure his misery much longer. This\r\n      occasioned us great distress, as it was altogether useless to\r\n      think of aiding him in any manner while the sea continued washing\r\n      over us as it did. We exhorted him to bear his sufferings with\r\n      fortitude, and promised to seize the first opportunity which\r\n      should offer itself to relieve him. He replied that it would soon\r\n      be too late; that it would be all over with him before we could\r\n      help him; and then, after moaning for some minutes, lay silent,\r\n      when we concluded that he had perished.\r\n\r\n      As the evening drew on, the sea had fallen so much that scarcely\r\n      more than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the\r\n      course of five minutes, and the wind had abated a great deal,\r\n      although still blowing a severe gale. I had not heard any of my\r\n      companions speak for hours, and now called to Augustus. He\r\n      replied, although very feebly, so that I could not distinguish\r\n      what he said. I then spoke to Peters and to Parker, neither of\r\n      whom returned any answer.\r\n\r\n      Shortly after this period I fell into a state of partial\r\n      insensibility, during which the most pleasing images floated in\r\n      my imagination; such as green trees, waving meadows of ripe\r\n      grain, processions of dancing girls, troops of cavalry, and other\r\n      phantasies. I now remember that, in all which passed before my\r\n      mind’s eye, motion was a predominant idea. Thus, I never fancied\r\n      any stationary object, such as a house, a mountain, or any thing\r\n      of that kind; but windmills, ships, large birds, balloons, people\r\n      on horseback, carriages driving furiously, and similar moving\r\n      objects, presented themselves in endless succession. When I\r\n      recovered from this state, the sun was, as near as I could guess,\r\n      an hour high. I had the greatest difficulty in bringing to\r\n      recollection the various circumstances connected with my\r\n      situation, and for some time remained firmly convinced that I was\r\n      still in the hold of the brig, near the box, and that the body of\r\n      Parker was that of Tiger.\r\n\r\n      When I at length completely came to my senses, I found that the\r\n      wind blew no more than a moderate breeze, and that the sea was\r\n      comparatively calm; so much so that it only washed over the brig\r\n      amidships. My left arm had broken loose from its lashings, and\r\n      was much cut about the elbow; my right was entirely benumbed, and\r\n      the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the pressure of the\r\n      rope, which had worked from the shoulder downward. I was also in\r\n      great pain from another rope which went about my waist, and had\r\n      been drawn to an insufferable degree of tightness. Looking round\r\n      upon my companions, I saw that Peters still lived, although a\r\n      thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him\r\n      the appearance of being cut nearly in two; as I stirred, he made\r\n      a feeble motion to me with his hand, pointing to the rope.\r\n      Augustus gave no indication of life whatever, and was bent nearly\r\n      double across a splinter of the windlass. Parker spoke to me when\r\n      he saw me moving, and asked me if I had not sufficient strength\r\n      to release him from his situation, saying that if I would summon\r\n      up what spirits I could, and contrive to untie him, we might yet\r\n      save our lives; but that otherwise we must all perish. I told him\r\n      to take courage, and I would endeavor to free him. Feeling in my\r\n      pantaloons’ pocket, I got hold of my penknife, and, after several\r\n      ineffectual attempts, at length succeeded in opening it. I then,\r\n      with my left hand, managed to free my right from its fastenings,\r\n      and afterward cut the other ropes which held me. Upon attempting,\r\n      however, to move from my position, I found that my legs failed me\r\n      altogether, and that I could not get up; neither could I move my\r\n      right arm in any direction. Upon mentioning this to Parker, he\r\n      advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes, holding on to the\r\n      windlass with my left hand, so as to allow time for the blood to\r\n      circulate. Doing this, the numbness presently began to die away\r\n      so that I could move first one of my legs, and then the other,\r\n      and, shortly afterward I regained the partial use of my right\r\n      arm. I now crawled with great caution toward Parker, without\r\n      getting on my legs, and soon cut loose all the lashings about\r\n      him, when, after a short delay, he also recovered the partial use\r\n      of his limbs. We now lost no time in getting loose the rope from\r\n      Peters. It had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his\r\n      woollen pantaloons, and through two shirts, and made its way into\r\n      his groin, from which the blood flowed out copiously as we\r\n      removed the cordage. No sooner had we removed it, however, than\r\n      he spoke, and seemed to experience instant relief—being able to\r\n      move with much greater ease than either Parker or myself—this was\r\n      no doubt owing to the discharge of blood.\r\n\r\n      We had little hopes that Augustus would recover, as he evinced no\r\n      signs of life; but, upon getting to him, we discovered that he\r\n      had merely swooned from the loss of blood, the bandages we had\r\n      placed around his wounded arm having been torn off by the water;\r\n      none of the ropes which held him to the windlass were drawn\r\n      sufficiently tight to occasion his death. Having relieved him\r\n      from the fastenings, and got him clear of the broken wood about\r\n      the windlass, we secured him in a dry place to windward, with his\r\n      head somewhat lower than his body, and all three of us busied\r\n      ourselves in chafing his limbs. In about half an hour he came to\r\n      himself, although it was not until the next morning that he gave\r\n      signs of recognizing any of us, or had sufficient strength to\r\n      speak. By the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was\r\n      quite dark, and it began to cloud up, so that we were again in\r\n      the greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard, in which\r\n      event nothing could have saved us from perishing, exhausted as we\r\n      were. By good fortune it continued very moderate during the\r\n      night, the sea subsiding every minute, which gave us great hopes\r\n      of ultimate preservation. A gentle breeze still blew from the N.\r\n      W., but the weather was not at all cold. Augustus was lashed\r\n      carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from\r\n      slipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel, as he was still\r\n      too weak to hold on at all. For ourselves there was no such\r\n      necessity. We sat close together, supporting each other with the\r\n      aid of the broken ropes about the windlass, and devising methods\r\n      of escape from our frightful situation. We derived much comfort\r\n      from taking off our clothes and wringing the water from them.\r\n      When we put them on after this, they felt remarkably warm and\r\n      pleasant, and served to invigorate us in no little degree. We\r\n      helped Augustus off with his, and wrung them for him, when he\r\n      experienced the same comfort.\r\n\r\n      Our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst, and\r\n      when we looked forward to the means of relief in this respect,\r\n      our hearts sunk within us, and we were induced to regret that we\r\n      had escaped the less dreadful perils of the sea. We endeavoured,\r\n      however, to console ourselves with the hope of being speedily\r\n      picked up by some vessel and encouraged each other to bear with\r\n      fortitude the evils that might happen.\r\n\r\n      The morning of the fourteenth at length dawned, and the weather\r\n      still continued clear and pleasant, with a steady but very light\r\n      breeze from the N. W. The sea was now quite smooth, and as, from\r\n      some cause which we could not determine, the brig did not lie so\r\n      much along as she had done before, the deck was comparatively\r\n      dry, and we could move about with freedom. We had now been better\r\n      than three entire days and nights without either food or drink,\r\n      and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an attempt\r\n      to get up something from below. As the brig was completely full\r\n      of water, we went to this work despondently, and with but little\r\n      expectation of being able to obtain anything. We made a kind of\r\n      drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of\r\n      the companion-hatch into two pieces of wood. Tying these across\r\n      each other, and fastening them to the end of a rope, we threw\r\n      them into the cabin, and dragged them to and fro, in the faint\r\n      hope of being thus able to entangle some article which might be\r\n      of use to us for food, or which might at least render us\r\n      assistance in getting it. We spent the greater part of the\r\n      morning in this labour without effect, fishing up nothing more\r\n      than a few bedclothes, which were readily caught by the nails.\r\n      Indeed, our contrivance was so very clumsy that any greater\r\n      success was hardly to be anticipated.\r\n\r\n      We now tried the forecastle, but equally in vain, and were upon\r\n      the brink of despair, when Peters proposed that we should fasten\r\n      a rope to his body, and let him make an attempt to get up\r\n      something by diving into the cabin. This proposition we hailed\r\n      with all the delight which reviving hope could inspire. He\r\n      proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the exception\r\n      of his pantaloons; and a strong rope was then carefully fastened\r\n      around his middle, being brought up over his shoulders in such a\r\n      manner that there was no possibility of its slipping. The\r\n      undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger; for, as we\r\n      could hardly expect to find much, if any, provision in the cabin\r\n      itself, it was necessary that the diver, after letting himself\r\n      down, should make a turn to the right, and proceed under water a\r\n      distance of ten or twelve feet, in a narrow passage, to the\r\n      storeroom, and return, without drawing breath.\r\n\r\n      Everything being ready, Peters now descended in the cabin, going\r\n      down the companion-ladder until the water reached his chin. He\r\n      then plunged in, head first, turning to the right as he plunged,\r\n      and endeavouring to make his way to the storeroom. In this first\r\n      attempt, however, he was altogether unsuccessful. In less than\r\n      half a minute after his going down we felt the rope jerked\r\n      violently (the signal we had agreed upon when he desired to be\r\n      drawn up). We accordingly drew him up instantly, but so\r\n      incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder. He had\r\n      brought nothing with him, and had been unable to penetrate more\r\n      than a very little way into the passage, owing to the constant\r\n      exertions he found it necessary to make in order to keep himself\r\n      from floating up against the deck. Upon getting out he was very\r\n      much exhausted, and had to rest full fifteen minutes before he\r\n      could again venture to descend.\r\n\r\n      The second attempt met with even worse success; for he remained\r\n      so long under water without giving the signal, that, becoming\r\n      alarmed for his safety, we drew him out without it, and found\r\n      that he was almost at the last gasp, having, as he said,\r\n      repeatedly jerked at the rope without our feeling it. This was\r\n      probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the\r\n      balustrade at the foot of the ladder. This balustrade was,\r\n      indeed, so much in the way, that we determined to remove it, if\r\n      possible, before proceeding with our design. As we had no means\r\n      of getting it away except by main force, we all descended into\r\n      the water as far as we could on the ladder, and giving a pull\r\n      against it with our united strength, succeeded in breaking it\r\n      down.\r\n\r\n      The third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first,\r\n      and it now became evident that nothing could be done in this\r\n      manner without the aid of some weight with which the diver might\r\n      steady himself, and keep to the floor of the cabin while making\r\n      his search. For a long time we looked about in vain for something\r\n      which might answer this purpose; but at length, to our great joy,\r\n      we discovered one of the weather-forechains so loose that we had\r\n      not the least difficulty in wrenching it off. Having fastened\r\n      this securely to one of his ankles, Peters now made his fourth\r\n      descent into the cabin, and this time succeeded in making his way\r\n      to the door of the steward’s room. To his inexpressible grief,\r\n      however, he found it locked, and was obliged to return without\r\n      effecting an entrance, as, with the greatest exertion, he could\r\n      remain under water not more, at the utmost extent, than a single\r\n      minute. Our affairs now looked gloomy indeed, and neither\r\n      Augustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears, as we\r\n      thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us, and the\r\n      slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape.\r\n      But this weakness was not of long duration. Throwing ourselves on\r\n      our knees to God, we implored His aid in the many dangers which\r\n      beset us; and arose with renewed hope and vigor to think what\r\n      could yet be done by mortal means toward accomplishing our\r\n      deliverance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10\r\n\r\n\r\n      Shortly afterward an incident occurred which I am induced to look\r\n      upon as more intensely productive of emotion, as far more replete\r\n      with the extremes first of delight and then of horror, than even\r\n      any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine\r\n      long years, crowded with events of the most startling and, in\r\n      many cases, of the most unconceived and unconceivable character.\r\n      We were lying on the deck near the companion-way, and debating\r\n      the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom, when,\r\n      looking toward Augustus, who lay fronting myself, I perceived\r\n      that he had become all at once deadly pale, and that his lips\r\n      were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner.\r\n      Greatly alarmed, I spoke to him, but he made me no reply, and I\r\n      was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill, when I\r\n      took notice of his eyes, which were glaring apparently at some\r\n      object behind me. I turned my head, and shall never forget the\r\n      ecstatic joy which thrilled through every particle of my frame,\r\n      when I perceived a large brig bearing down upon us, and not more\r\n      than a couple of miles off. I sprung to my feet as if a musket\r\n      bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart; and, stretching out\r\n      my arms in the direction of the vessel, stood in this manner,\r\n      motionless, and unable to articulate a syllable. Peters and\r\n      Parker were equally affected, although in different ways. The\r\n      former danced about the deck like a madman, uttering the most\r\n      extravagant rhodomontades, intermingled with howls and\r\n      imprecations, while the latter burst into tears, and continued\r\n      for many minutes weeping like a child.\r\n\r\n      The vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig, of a Dutch\r\n      build, and painted black, with a tawdry gilt figure-head. She had\r\n      evidently seen a good deal of rough weather, and, we supposed,\r\n      had suffered much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to\r\n      ourselves; for her foretopmast was gone, and some of her\r\n      starboard bulwarks. When we first saw her, she was, as I have\r\n      already said, about two miles off and to windward, bearing down\r\n      upon us. The breeze was very gentle, and what astonished us\r\n      chiefly was, that she had no other sails set than her foremast\r\n      and mainsail, with a flying jib—of course she came down but\r\n      slowly, and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy. The\r\n      awkward manner in which she steered, too, was remarked by all of\r\n      us, even excited as we were. She yawed about so considerably,\r\n      that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us, or\r\n      imagined that, having seen us, and discovered no person on board,\r\n      she was about to tack and make off in another direction. Upon\r\n      each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our\r\n      voices, when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her\r\n      intention, and again hold on toward us—this singular conduct\r\n      being repeated two or three times, so that at last we could think\r\n      of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the\r\n      helmsman to be in liquor.\r\n\r\n      No person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about\r\n      a quarter of a mile of us. We then saw three seamen, whom by\r\n      their dress we took to be Hollanders. Two of these were lying on\r\n      some old sails near the forecastle, and the third, who appeared\r\n      to be looking at us with great curiosity, was leaning over the\r\n      starboard bow near the bowsprit. This last was a stout and tall\r\n      man, with a very dark skin. He seemed by his manner to be\r\n      encouraging us to have patience, nodding to us in a cheerful\r\n      although rather odd way, and smiling constantly, so as to display\r\n      a set of the most brilliantly white teeth. As his vessel drew\r\n      nearer, we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his\r\n      head into the water; but of this he took little or no notice,\r\n      continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations. I relate these\r\n      things and circumstances minutely, and I relate them, it must be\r\n      understood, precisely as they _appeared_to us.\r\n\r\n      The brig came on slowly, and now more steadily than before, and—I\r\n      cannot speak calmly of this event—our hearts leaped up wildly\r\n      within us, and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and\r\n      thanksgiving to God for the complete, unexpected, and glorious\r\n      deliverance that was so palpably at hand. Of a sudden, and all at\r\n      once, there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel\r\n      (which was now close upon us) a smell, a stench, such as the\r\n      whole world has no name for—no conception of—hellish—utterly\r\n      suffocating—insufferable, inconceivable. I gasped for breath, and\r\n      turning to my companions, perceived that they were paler than\r\n      marble. But we had now no time left for question or surmise—the\r\n      brig was within fifty feet of us, and it seemed to be her\r\n      intention to run under our counter, that we might board her\r\n      without putting out a boat. We rushed aft, when, suddenly, a wide\r\n      yaw threw her off full five or six points from the course she had\r\n      been running, and, as she passed under our stern at the distance\r\n      of about twenty feet, we had a full view of her decks. Shall I\r\n      ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle? Twenty-five or\r\n      thirty human bodies, among whom were several females, lay\r\n      scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last\r\n      and most loathsome state of putrefaction. We plainly saw that not\r\n      a soul lived in that fated vessel! Yet we could not help shouting\r\n      to the dead for help! Yes, long and loudly did we beg, in the\r\n      agony of the moment, that those silent and disgusting images\r\n      would stay for us, would not abandon us to become like them,\r\n      would receive us among their goodly company! We were raving with\r\n      horror and despair—thoroughly mad through the anguish of our\r\n      grievous disappointment.\r\n\r\n      As our first loud yell of terror broke forth, it was replied to\r\n      by something, from near the bowsprit of the stranger, so closely\r\n      resembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might\r\n      have been startled and deceived. At this instant another sudden\r\n      yaw brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view,\r\n      and we beheld at once the origin of the sound. We saw the tall\r\n      stout figure still leaning on the bulwark, and still nodding his\r\n      head to and fro, but his face was now turned from us so that we\r\n      could not behold it. His arms were extended over the rail, and\r\n      the palms of his hands fell outward. His knees were lodged upon a\r\n      stout rope, tightly stretched, and reaching from the heel of the\r\n      bowsprit to a cathead. On his back, from which a portion of the\r\n      shirt had been torn, leaving it bare, there sat a huge sea-gull,\r\n      busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh, its bill and\r\n      talons deep buried, and its white plumage spattered all over with\r\n      blood. As the brig moved farther round so as to bring us close in\r\n      view, the bird, with much apparent difficulty, drew out its\r\n      crimsoned head, and, after eyeing us for a moment as if\r\n      stupefied, arose lazily from the body upon which it had been\r\n      feasting, and, flying directly above our deck, hovered there a\r\n      while with a portion of clotted and liver-like substance in its\r\n      beak. The horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash\r\n      immediately at the feet of Parker. May God forgive me, but now,\r\n      for the first time, there flashed through my mind a thought, a\r\n      thought which I will not mention, and I felt myself making a step\r\n      toward the ensanguined spot. I looked upward, and the eyes of\r\n      Augustus met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning\r\n      which immediately brought me to my senses. I sprang forward\r\n      quickly, and, with a deep shudder, threw the frightful thing into\r\n      the sea.\r\n\r\n      The body from which it had been taken, resting as it did upon the\r\n      rope, had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the\r\n      carnivorous bird, and it was this motion which had at first\r\n      impressed us with the belief of its being alive. As the gull\r\n      relieved it of its weight, it swung round and fell partially\r\n      over, so that the face was fully discovered. Never, surely, was\r\n      any object so terribly full of awe! The eyes were gone, and the\r\n      whole flesh around the mouth, leaving the teeth utterly naked.\r\n      This, then, was the smile which had cheered us on to hope! this\r\n      the—but I forbear. The brig, as I have already told, passed under\r\n      our stern, and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward. With\r\n      her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of\r\n      deliverance and joy. Deliberately as she went by, we might\r\n      possibly have found means of boarding her, had not our sudden\r\n      disappointment and the appalling nature of the discovery which\r\n      accompanied it laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of\r\n      mind and body. We had seen and felt, but we could neither think\r\n      nor act, until, alas! too late. How much our intellects had been\r\n      weakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact, that when\r\n      the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more\r\n      than the half of her hull, the proposition was seriously\r\n      entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming!\r\n\r\n      I have, since this period, vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew\r\n      to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the\r\n      stranger. Her build and general appearance, as I have before\r\n      stated, led us to the belief that she was a Dutch trader, and the\r\n      dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion. We might have\r\n      easily seen the name upon her stern, and, indeed, taken other\r\n      observations, which would have guided us in making out her\r\n      character; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to\r\n      every thing of that nature. From the saffron-like hue of such of\r\n      the corpses as were not entirely decayed, we concluded that the\r\n      whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever, or some\r\n      other virulent disease of the same fearful kind. If such were the\r\n      case (and I know not what else to imagine), death, to judge from\r\n      the positions of the bodies, must have come upon them in a manner\r\n      awfully sudden and overwhelming, in a way totally distinct from\r\n      that which generally characterizes even the most deadly\r\n      pestilences with which mankind are acquainted. It is possible,\r\n      indeed, that poison, accidentally introduced into some of their\r\n      sea-stores, may have brought about the disaster, or that the\r\n      eating of some unknown venomous species of fish, or other marine\r\n      animal, or oceanic bird, might have induced it—but it is utterly\r\n      useless to form conjectures where all is involved, and will, no\r\n      doubt, remain for ever involved, in the most appalling and\r\n      unfathomable mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11\r\n\r\n\r\n      We spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid\r\n      lethargy, gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness,\r\n      hiding her from our sight, recalled us in some measure to our\r\n      senses. The pangs of hunger and thirst then returned, absorbing\r\n      all other cares and considerations. Nothing, however, could be\r\n      done until the morning, and, securing ourselves as well as\r\n      possible, we endeavoured to snatch a little repose. In this I\r\n      succeeded beyond my expectations, sleeping until my companions,\r\n      who had not been so fortunate, aroused me at daybreak to renew\r\n      our attempts at getting up provisions from the hull.\r\n\r\n      It was now a dead calm, with the sea as smooth as I have ever\r\n      known it,—the weather warm and pleasant. The brig was out of\r\n      sight. We commenced our operations by wrenching off, with some\r\n      trouble, another of the forechains; and having fastened both to\r\n      Peters’ feet, he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the\r\n      storeroom, thinking it possible that he might be able to force it\r\n      open, provided he could get at it in sufficient time; and this he\r\n      hoped to do, as the hulk lay much more steadily than before.\r\n\r\n      He succeeded very quickly in reaching the door, when, loosening\r\n      one of the chains from his ankle, he made every exertion to force\r\n      the passage with it, but in vain, the framework of the room being\r\n      far stronger than was anticipated. He was quite exhausted with\r\n      his long stay under water, and it became absolutely necessary\r\n      that some other one of us should take his place. For this service\r\n      Parker immediately volunteered; but, after making three\r\n      ineffectual efforts, found that he could never even succeed in\r\n      getting near the door. The condition of Augustus’s wounded arm\r\n      rendered it useless for him to attempt going down, as he would be\r\n      unable to force the room open should he reach it, and it\r\n      accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common\r\n      deliverance.\r\n\r\n      Peters had left one of the chains in the passage, and I found,\r\n      upon plunging in, that I had not sufficient balance to keep me\r\n      firmly down. I determined, therefore, to attempt no more, in my\r\n      first effort, than merely to recover the other chain. In groping\r\n      along the floor of the passage for this, I felt a hard substance,\r\n      which I immediately grasped, not having time to ascertain what it\r\n      was, but returning and ascending instantly to the surface. The\r\n      prize proved to be a bottle, and our joy may be conceived when I\r\n      say that it was found to be full of port wine. Giving thanks to\r\n      God for this timely and cheering assistance, we immediately drew\r\n      the cork with my penknife, and, each taking a moderate sup, felt\r\n      the most indescribable comfort from the warmth, strength, and\r\n      spirits with which it inspired us. We then carefully recorked the\r\n      bottle, and, by means of a handkerchief, swung it in such a\r\n      manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken.\r\n\r\n      Having rested a while after this fortunate discovery, I again\r\n      descended, and now recovered the chain, with which I instantly\r\n      came up. I then fastened it on and went down for the third time,\r\n      when I became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever, in that\r\n      situation, would enable me to force open the door of the\r\n      storeroom. I therefore returned in despair.\r\n\r\n      There seemed now to be no longer any room for hope, and I could\r\n      perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made\r\n      up their minds to perish. The wine had evidently produced in them\r\n      a species of delirium, which, perhaps, I had been prevented from\r\n      feeling by the immersion I had undergone since drinking it. They\r\n      talked incoherently, and about matters unconnected with our\r\n      condition, Peters repeatedly asking me questions about Nantucket.\r\n      Augustus, too, I remember, approached me with a serious air, and\r\n      requested me to lend him a pocket-comb, as his hair was full of\r\n      fish-scales, and he wished to get them out before going on shore.\r\n      Parker appeared somewhat less affected, and urged me to dive at\r\n      random into the cabin, and bring up any article which might come\r\n      to hand. To this I consented, and, in the first attempt, after\r\n      staying under a full minute, brought up a small leather trunk\r\n      belonging to Captain Barnard. This was immediately opened in the\r\n      faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink. We\r\n      found nothing, however, except a box of razors and two linen\r\n      shirts. I now went down again, and returned without any success.\r\n      As my head came above water I heard a crash on deck, and, upon\r\n      getting up, saw that my companions had ungratefully taken\r\n      advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine,\r\n      having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before\r\n      I saw them. I remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of\r\n      their conduct, when Augustus burst into tears. The other two\r\n      endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke, but I hope never\r\n      again to behold laughter of such a species: the distortion of\r\n      countenance was absolutely frightful. Indeed, it was apparent\r\n      that the stimulus, in the empty state of their stomachs, had\r\n      taken instant and violent effect, and that they were all\r\n      exceedingly intoxicated. With great difficulty I prevailed upon\r\n      them to lie down, when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber,\r\n      accompanied with loud stertorous breathing.\r\n\r\n      I now found myself, as it were, alone in the brig, and my\r\n      reflections, to be sure, were of the most fearful and gloomy\r\n      nature. No prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering\r\n      death by famine, or, at the best, by being overwhelmed in the\r\n      first gale which should spring up, for in our present exhausted\r\n      condition we could have no hope of living through another.\r\n\r\n      The gnawing hunger which I now experienced was nearly\r\n      insupportable, and I felt myself capable of going to any lengths\r\n      in order to appease it. With my knife I cut off a small portion\r\n      of the leather trunk, and endeavoured to eat it, but found it\r\n      utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel, although I fancied\r\n      that some little alleviation of my suffering was obtained by\r\n      chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out. Toward night my\r\n      companions awoke, one by one, each in an indescribable state of\r\n      weakness and horror, brought on by the wine, whose fumes had now\r\n      evaporated. They shook as if with a violent ague, and uttered the\r\n      most lamentable cries for water. Their condition affected me in\r\n      the most lively degree, at the same time causing me to rejoice in\r\n      the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from\r\n      indulging in the wine, and consequently from sharing their\r\n      melancholy and most distressing sensations. Their conduct,\r\n      however, gave me great uneasiness and alarm; for it was evident\r\n      that, unless some favourable change took place, they could afford\r\n      me no assistance in providing for our common safety. I had not\r\n      yet abandoned all idea of being able to get up something from\r\n      below; but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some\r\n      one of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by\r\n      holding the end of the rope while I went down. Parker appeared to\r\n      be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others, and\r\n      I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to rouse him. Thinking\r\n      that a plunge in the sea-water might have a beneficial effect, I\r\n      contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body, and then,\r\n      leading him to the companion-way (he remaining quite passive all\r\n      the while), pushed him in, and immediately drew him out. I had\r\n      good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this\r\n      experiment; for he appeared much revived and invigorated, and,\r\n      upon getting out, asked me, in a rational manner, why I had so\r\n      served him. Having explained my object, he expressed himself\r\n      indebted to me, and said that he felt greatly better from the\r\n      immersion, afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation. We\r\n      then resolved to treat Augustus and Peters in the same way, which\r\n      we immediately did, when they both experienced much benefit from\r\n      the shock. This idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me\r\n      by reading in some medical work the good effect of the\r\n      shower-bath in a case where the patient was suffering from _mania\r\n      a potu_.\r\n\r\n      Finding that I could now trust my companions to hold the end of\r\n      the rope, I again made three or four plunges into the cabin,\r\n      although it was now quite dark, and a gentle but long swell from\r\n      the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady. In the course\r\n      of these attempts I succeeded in bringing up two case-knives, a\r\n      three-gallon jug, empty, and a blanket, but nothing which could\r\n      serve us for food. I continued my efforts, after getting these\r\n      articles, until I was completely exhausted, but brought up\r\n      nothing else. During the night Parker and Peters occupied\r\n      themselves by turns in the same manner; but nothing coming to\r\n      hand, we now gave up this attempt in despair, concluding that we\r\n      were exhausting ourselves in vain.\r\n\r\n      We passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most\r\n      intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined.\r\n      The morning of the sixteenth at length dawned, and we looked\r\n      eagerly around the horizon for relief, but to no purpose. The sea\r\n      was still smooth, with only a long swell from the northward, as\r\n      on yesterday. This was the sixth day since we had tasted either\r\n      food or drink, with the exception of the bottle of port wine, and\r\n      it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while\r\n      longer unless something could be obtained. I never saw before,\r\n      nor wish to see again, human beings so utterly emaciated as\r\n      Peters and Augustus. Had I met them on shore in their present\r\n      condition I should not have had the slightest suspicion that I\r\n      had ever beheld them. Their countenances were totally changed in\r\n      character, so that I could not bring myself to believe them\r\n      really the same individuals with whom I had been in company but a\r\n      few days before. Parker, although sadly reduced, and so feeble\r\n      that he could not raise his head from his bosom, was not so far\r\n      gone as the other two. He suffered with great patience, making no\r\n      complaint, and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every\r\n      manner he could devise. For myself, although at the commencement\r\n      of the voyage I had been in bad health, and was at all times of a\r\n      delicate constitution, I suffered less than any of us, being much\r\n      less reduced in frame, and retaining my powers of mind in a\r\n      surprising degree, while the rest were completely prostrated in\r\n      intellect, and seemed to be brought to a species of second\r\n      childhood, generally simpering in their expressions, with idiotic\r\n      smiles, and uttering the most absurd platitudes. At intervals,\r\n      however, they would appear to revive suddenly, as if inspired all\r\n      at once with a consciousness of their condition, when they would\r\n      spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour, and speak,\r\n      for a short period, of their prospects, in a manner altogether\r\n      rational, although full of the most intense despair. It is\r\n      possible, however, that my companions may have entertained the\r\n      same opinion of their own condition as I did of mine, and that I\r\n      may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and\r\n      imbecilities as themselves—this is a matter which cannot be\r\n      determined.\r\n\r\n      About noon Parker declared that he saw land off the larboard\r\n      quarter, and it was with the utmost difficulty I could restrain\r\n      him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming toward\r\n      it. Peters and Augustus took little notice of what he said, being\r\n      apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation. Upon looking in the\r\n      direction pointed out, I could not perceive the faintest\r\n      appearance of the shore—indeed, I was too well aware that we were\r\n      far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature. It was a\r\n      long time, nevertheless, before I could convince Parker of his\r\n      mistake. He then burst into a flood of tears, weeping like a\r\n      child, with loud cries and sobs, for two or three hours, when\r\n      becoming exhausted, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\n      Peters and Augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to\r\n      swallow portions of the leather. I advised them to chew it and\r\n      spit it out; but they were too excessively debilitated to be able\r\n      to follow my advice. I continued to chew pieces of it at\r\n      intervals, and found some relief from so doing; my chief distress\r\n      was for water, and I was only prevented from taking a draught\r\n      from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus\r\n      have resulted to others who were similarly situated with\r\n      ourselves.\r\n\r\n      The day wore on in this manner, when I suddenly discovered a sail\r\n      to the eastward, and on our larboard bow. She appeared to be a\r\n      large ship, and was coming nearly athwart us, being probably\r\n      twelve or fifteen miles distant. None of my companions had as yet\r\n      discovered her, and I forbore to tell them of her for the\r\n      present, lest we might again be disappointed of relief. At length\r\n      upon her getting nearer, I saw distinctly that she was heading\r\n      immediately for us, with her light sails filled. I could now\r\n      contain myself no longer, and pointed her out to my\r\n      fellow-sufferers. They immediately sprang to their feet, again\r\n      indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy, weeping,\r\n      laughing in an idiotic manner, jumping, stamping upon the deck,\r\n      tearing their hair, and praying and cursing by turns. I was so\r\n      affected by their conduct, as well as by what I considered a sure\r\n      prospect of deliverance, that I could not refrain from joining in\r\n      with their madness, and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude\r\n      and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck, clapping my hands,\r\n      shouting, and other similar acts, until I was suddenly called to\r\n      my recollection, and once more to the extreme human misery and\r\n      despair, by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully\r\n      presented toward us, and steering in a direction nearly opposite\r\n      to that in which I had at first perceived her.\r\n\r\n      It was some time before I could induce my poor companions to\r\n      believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken\r\n      place. They replied to all my assertions with a stare and a\r\n      gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such\r\n      misrepresentations. The conduct of Augustus most sensibly\r\n      affected me. In spite of all I could say or do to the contrary,\r\n      he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us, and\r\n      in making preparations to go on board of her. Some seaweed\r\n      floating by the brig, he maintained that it was the ship’s boat,\r\n      and endeavoured to throw himself upon it, howling and shrieking\r\n      in the most heartrending manner, when I forcibly restrained him\r\n      from thus casting himself into the sea.\r\n\r\n      Having become in some degree pacified, we continued to watch the\r\n      ship until we finally lost sight of her, the weather becoming\r\n      hazy, with a light breeze springing up. As soon as she was\r\n      entirely gone, Parker turned suddenly toward me with an\r\n      expression of countenance which made me shudder. There was about\r\n      him an air of self-possession which I had not noticed in him\r\n      until now, and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he\r\n      would say. He proposed, in a few words, that one of us should die\r\n      to preserve the existence of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12\r\n\r\n\r\n      I had for some time past, dwelt upon the prospect of our being\r\n      reduced to this last horrible extremity, and had secretly made up\r\n      my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances\r\n      rather than resort to such a course. Nor was this resolution in\r\n      any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under\r\n      which I laboured. The proposition had not been heard by either\r\n      Peters or Augustus. I therefore took Parker aside; and mentally\r\n      praying to God for power to dissuade him from the horrible\r\n      purpose he entertained, I expostulated with him for a long time,\r\n      and in the most supplicating manner, begging him in the name of\r\n      every thing which he held sacred, and urging him by every species\r\n      of argument which the extremity of the case suggested, to abandon\r\n      the idea, and not to mention it to either of the other two.\r\n\r\n      He heard all I said without attempting to controvert any of my\r\n      arguments, and I had begun to hope that he would be prevailed\r\n      upon to do as I desired. But when I had ceased speaking, he said\r\n      that he knew very well all I had said was true, and that to\r\n      resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which\r\n      could enter into the mind of man; but that he had now held out as\r\n      long as human nature could be sustained; that it was unnecessary\r\n      for all to perish, when, by the death of one, it was possible,\r\n      and even probable, that the rest might be finally preserved;\r\n      adding that I might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him\r\n      from his purpose, his mind having been thoroughly made up on the\r\n      subject even before the appearance of the ship, and that only her\r\n      heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention\r\n      at an earlier period.\r\n\r\n      I now begged him, if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon\r\n      his design, at least to defer it for another day, when some\r\n      vessel might come to our relief; again reiterating every argument\r\n      I could devise, and which I thought likely to have influence with\r\n      one of his rough nature. He said, in reply, that he had not\r\n      spoken until the very last possible moment, that he could exist\r\n      no longer without sustenance of some kind, and that therefore in\r\n      another day his suggestion would be too late, as regarded himself\r\n      at least.\r\n\r\n      Finding that he was not to be moved by anything I could say in a\r\n      mild tone, I now assumed a different demeanor, and told him that\r\n      he must be aware I had suffered less than any of us from our\r\n      calamities; that my health and strength, consequently, were at\r\n      that moment far better than his own, or than that either of\r\n      Peters or Augustus; in short, that I was in a condition to have\r\n      my own way by force if I found it necessary; and that if he\r\n      attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody\r\n      and cannibal designs, I would not hesitate to throw him into the\r\n      sea. Upon this he immediately seized me by the throat, and\r\n      drawing a knife, made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in\r\n      the stomach; an atrocity which his excessive debility alone\r\n      prevented him from accomplishing. In the meantime, being roused\r\n      to a high pitch of anger, I forced him to the vessel’s side, with\r\n      the full intention of throwing him overboard. He was saved from\r\n      his fate, however, by the interference of Peters, who now\r\n      approached and separated us, asking the cause of the disturbance.\r\n      This Parker told before I could find means in any manner to\r\n      prevent him.\r\n\r\n      The effect of his words was even more terrible than what I had\r\n      anticipated. Both Augustus and Peters, who, it seems, had long\r\n      secretly entertained the same fearful idea which Parker had been\r\n      merely the first to broach, joined with him in his design and\r\n      insisted upon its immediately being carried into effect. I had\r\n      calculated that one at least of the two former would be found\r\n      still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with\r\n      myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose,\r\n      and, with the aid of either one of them, I had no fear of being\r\n      able to prevent its accomplishment. Being disappointed in this\r\n      expectation, it became absolutely necessary that I should attend\r\n      to my own safety, as a further resistance on my part might\r\n      possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a\r\n      sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that I\r\n      knew would speedily be enacted.\r\n\r\n      I now told them I was willing to submit to the proposal, merely\r\n      requesting a delay of about one hour, in order that the fog which\r\n      had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting, when\r\n      it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in\r\n      sight. After great difficulty I obtained from them a promise to\r\n      wait thus long; and, as I had anticipated (a breeze rapidly\r\n      coming in), the fog lifted before the hour had expired, when, no\r\n      vessel appearing in sight, we prepared to draw lots.\r\n\r\n      It is with extreme reluctance that I dwell upon the appalling\r\n      scene which ensued; a scene which, with its minutest details, no\r\n      after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree\r\n      from my memory, and whose stern recollection will embitter every\r\n      future moment of my existence. Let me run over this portion of my\r\n      narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be\r\n      spoken of will permit. The only method we could devise for the\r\n      terrific lottery, in which we were to take each a chance, was\r\n      that of drawing straws. Small splinters of wood were made to\r\n      answer our purpose, and it was agreed that I should be the\r\n      holder. I retired to one end of the hulk, while my poor\r\n      companions silently took up their station in the other with their\r\n      backs turned toward me. The bitterest anxiety which I endured at\r\n      any period of this fearful drama was while I occupied myself in\r\n      the arrangement of the lots. There are few conditions into which\r\n      man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in\r\n      the preservation of his existence; an interest momentarily\r\n      increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that\r\n      existence may be held. But now that the silent, definite, and\r\n      stern nature of the business in which I was engaged (so different\r\n      from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually\r\n      approaching horrors of famine) allowed me to reflect on the few\r\n      chances I had of escaping the most appalling of deaths—a death\r\n      for the most appalling of purposes—every particle of that energy\r\n      which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the\r\n      wind, leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable\r\n      terror. I could not, at first, even summon up sufficient strength\r\n      to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood, my fingers\r\n      absolutely refusing their office, and my knees knocking violently\r\n      against each other. My mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd\r\n      projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful\r\n      speculation. I thought of falling on my knees to my companions,\r\n      and entreating them to let me escape this necessity; of suddenly\r\n      rushing upon them, and, by putting one of them to death, of\r\n      rendering the decision by lot useless—in short, of every thing\r\n      but of going through with the matter I had in hand. At last,\r\n      after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct, I was\r\n      recalled to my senses by the voice of Parker, who urged me to\r\n      relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were\r\n      enduring. Even then I could not bring myself to arrange the\r\n      splinters upon the spot, but thought over every species of\r\n      finesse by which I could trick some one of my fellow-sufferers to\r\n      draw the short straw, as it had been agreed that whoever drew the\r\n      shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the\r\n      preservation of the rest. Before any one condemn me for this\r\n      apparent heartlessness, let him be placed in a situation\r\n      precisely similar to my own.\r\n\r\n      At length delay was no longer possible, and, with a heart almost\r\n      bursting from my bosom, I advanced to the region of the\r\n      forecastle, where my companions were awaiting me. I held out my\r\n      hand with the splinters, and Peters immediately drew. He was\r\n      free—his, at least, was not the shortest; and there was now\r\n      another chance against my escape. I summoned up all my strength,\r\n      and passed the lots to Augustus. He also drew immediately, and he\r\n      also was free; and now, whether I should live or die, the chances\r\n      were no more than precisely even. At this moment all the\r\n      fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom, and I felt toward my\r\n      poor fellow-creature, Parker, the most intense, the most\r\n      diabolical hatred. But the feeling did not last; and, at length,\r\n      with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes, I held out the two\r\n      remaining splinters toward him. It was fully five minutes before\r\n      he could summon resolution to draw, during which period of\r\n      heartrending suspense I never once opened my eyes. Presently one\r\n      of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand. The decision was\r\n      then over, yet I knew not whether it was for me or against me. No\r\n      one spoke, and still I dared not satisfy myself by looking at the\r\n      splinter I held. Peters at length took me by the hand, and I\r\n      forced myself to look up, when I immediately saw by the\r\n      countenance of Parker that I was safe, and that he it was who had\r\n      been doomed to suffer. Gasping for breath, I fell senseless to\r\n      the deck.\r\n\r\n      I recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of\r\n      the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental\r\n      in bringing it about. He made no resistance whatever, and was\r\n      stabbed in the back by Peters, when he fell instantly dead. I\r\n      must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued.\r\n      Such things may be imagined, but words have no power to impress\r\n      the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality. Let it\r\n      suffice to say that, having in some measure appeased the raging\r\n      thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim, and having\r\n      by common consent taken off the hands, feet, and head, throwing\r\n      them together with the entrails, into the sea, we devoured the\r\n      rest of the body, piecemeal, during the four ever memorable days\r\n      of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth of the\r\n      month.\r\n\r\n      On the nineteenth, there coming on a smart shower which lasted\r\n      fifteen or twenty minutes, we contrived to catch some water by\r\n      means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our\r\n      drag just after the gale. The quantity we took in all did not\r\n      amount to more than half a gallon; but even this scanty allowance\r\n      supplied us with comparative strength and hope.\r\n\r\n      On the twenty-first we were again reduced to the last necessity.\r\n      The weather still remained warm and pleasant, with occasional\r\n      fogs and light breezes, most usually from N. to W.\r\n\r\n      On the twenty-second, as we were sitting close huddled together,\r\n      gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition, there flashed\r\n      through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a\r\n      bright gleam of hope. I remembered that, when the foremast had\r\n      been cut away, Peters, being in the windward chains, passed one\r\n      of the axes into my hand, requesting me to put it, if possible,\r\n      in a place of security, and that a few minutes before the last\r\n      heavy sea struck the brig and filled her I had taken this axe\r\n      into the forecastle and laid it in one of the larboard berths. I\r\n      now thought it possible that, by getting at this axe, we might\r\n      cut through the deck over the storeroom, and thus readily supply\r\n      ourselves with provisions.\r\n\r\n      When I communicated this object to my companions, they uttered a\r\n      feeble shout of joy, and we all proceeded forthwith to the\r\n      forecastle. The difficulty of descending here was greater than\r\n      that of going down in the cabin, the opening being much smaller,\r\n      for it will be remembered that the whole framework about the\r\n      cabin companion-hatch had been carried away, whereas the\r\n      forecastle-way, being a simple hatch of only about three feet\r\n      square, had remained uninjured. I did not hesitate, however, to\r\n      attempt the descent; and a rope being fastened round my body as\r\n      before, I plunged boldly in, feet foremost, made my way quickly\r\n      to the berth, and at the first attempt brought up the axe. It was\r\n      hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph, and the ease with\r\n      which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our\r\n      ultimate preservation.\r\n\r\n      We now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of\r\n      rekindled hope, Peters and myself taking the axe by turns,\r\n      Augustus’s wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any\r\n      degree. As we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to\r\n      stand unsupported, and could consequently work but a minute or\r\n      two without resting, it soon became evident that many long hours\r\n      would be necessary to accomplish our task—that is, to cut an\r\n      opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the\r\n      storeroom. This consideration, however, did not discourage us;\r\n      and, working all night by the light of the moon, we succeeded in\r\n      effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the\r\n      twenty-third.\r\n\r\n      Peters now volunteered to go down; and, having made all\r\n      arrangements as before, he descended, and soon returned bringing\r\n      up with him a small jar, which, to our great joy, proved to be\r\n      full of olives. Having shared these among us, and devoured them\r\n      with the greatest avidity, we proceeded to let him down again.\r\n      This time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations, returning\r\n      instantly with a large ham and a bottle of Madeira wine. Of the\r\n      latter we each took a moderate sup, having learned by experience\r\n      the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely. The ham,\r\n      except about two pounds near the bone, was not in a condition to\r\n      be eaten, having been entirely spoiled by the salt water. The\r\n      sound part was divided among us. Peters and Augustus, not being\r\n      able to restrain their appetite, swallowed theirs upon the\r\n      instant; but I was more cautious, and ate but a small portion of\r\n      mine, dreading the thirst which I knew would ensue. We now rested\r\n      a while from our labors, which had been intolerably severe.\r\n\r\n      By noon, feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed, we again\r\n      renewed our attempt at getting up provisions, Peters and myself\r\n      going down alternately, and always with more or less success,\r\n      until sundown. During this interval we had the good fortune to\r\n      bring up, altogether, four more small jars of olives, another\r\n      ham, a carboy containing nearly three gallons of excellent Cape\r\n      Madeira wine, and, what gave us still more delight, a small\r\n      tortoise of the Gallipago breed, several of which had been taken\r\n      on board by Captain Barnard, as the _Grampus_ was leaving port,\r\n      from the schooner _Mary Pitts_, just returned from a sealing\r\n      voyage in the Pacific.\r\n\r\n      In a subsequent portion of this narrative I shall have frequent\r\n      occasion to mention this species of tortoise. It is found\r\n      principally, as most of my readers may know, in the group of\r\n      islands called the Gallipagos, which, indeed, derive their name\r\n      from the animal—the Spanish word Gallipago meaning a fresh-water\r\n      terrapin. From the peculiarity of their shape and action they\r\n      have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise. They are\r\n      frequently found of an enormous size. I have myself seen several\r\n      which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds, although\r\n      I do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them\r\n      weighing more than eight hundred. Their appearance is singular,\r\n      and even disgusting. Their steps are very slow, measured, and\r\n      heavy, their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground.\r\n      Their neck is long, and exceedingly slender, from eighteen inches\r\n      to two feet is a very common length, and I killed one, where the\r\n      distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no\r\n      less than three feet ten inches. The head has a striking\r\n      resemblance to that of a serpent. They can exist without food for\r\n      an almost incredible length of time, instances having been known\r\n      where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain\r\n      two years without nourishment of any kind—being as fat, and, in\r\n      every respect, in as good order at the expiration of the time as\r\n      when they were first put in. In one particular these\r\n      extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary, or\r\n      camel of the desert. In a bag at the root of the neck they carry\r\n      with them a constant supply of water. In some instances, upon\r\n      killing them after a full year’s deprivation of all nourishment,\r\n      as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have\r\n      been found in their bags. Their food is chiefly wild parsley and\r\n      celery, with purslain, sea-kelp, and prickly pears, upon which\r\n      latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully, a great quantity of it\r\n      being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the\r\n      animal itself is discovered. They are excellent and highly\r\n      nutritious food, and have, no doubt, been the means of preserving\r\n      the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whale-fishery\r\n      and other pursuits in the Pacific.\r\n\r\n      The one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the\r\n      storeroom was not of a large size, weighing probably sixty-five\r\n      or seventy pounds. It was a female, and in excellent condition,\r\n      being exceedingly fat, and having more than a quart of limpid and\r\n      sweet water in its bag. This was indeed a treasure; and, falling\r\n      on our knees with one accord, we returned fervent thanks to God\r\n      for so seasonable a relief.\r\n\r\n      We had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the\r\n      opening, as its struggles were fierce and its strength\r\n      prodigious. It was upon the point of making its escape from\r\n      Peter’s grasp, and slipping back into the water, when Augustus,\r\n      throwing a rope with a slipknot around its throat, held it up in\r\n      this manner until I jumped into the hole by the side of Peters,\r\n      and assisted him in lifting it out.\r\n\r\n      The water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug; which, it\r\n      will be remembered, had been brought up before from the cabin.\r\n      Having done this, we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to\r\n      form, with the cork, a kind of glass, holding not quite half a\r\n      gill. We then each drank one of these measures full, and resolved\r\n      to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should\r\n      hold out.\r\n\r\n      During the last two or three days, the weather having been dry\r\n      and pleasant, the bedding we had obtained from the cabin, as well\r\n      as our clothing, had become thoroughly dry, so that we passed\r\n      this night (that of the twenty-third) in comparative comfort,\r\n      enjoying a tranquil repose, after having supped plentifully on\r\n      olives and ham, with a small allowance of the wine. Being afraid\r\n      of losing some of our stores overboard during the night, in the\r\n      event of a breeze springing up, we secured them as well as\r\n      possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass. Our\r\n      tortoise, which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we\r\n      could, we threw on its back, and otherwise carefully fastened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13\r\n\r\n\r\n      July 24. This morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and\r\n      strength. Notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were\r\n      still placed, ignorant of our position, although certainly at a\r\n      great distance from land, without more food than would last us\r\n      for a fortnight even with great care, almost entirely without\r\n      water, and floating about at the mercy of every wind and wave on\r\n      the merest wreck in the world, still the infinitely more terrible\r\n      distresses and dangers from which we had so lately and so\r\n      providentially been delivered caused us to regard what we now\r\n      endured as but little more than an ordinary evil—so strictly\r\n      comparative is either good or ill.\r\n\r\n      At sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up\r\n      something from the storeroom, when, a smart shower coming on,\r\n      with some lightning, we turn our attention to the catching of\r\n      water by means of the sheet we had used before for this purpose.\r\n      We had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the\r\n      sheet spread out with one of the forechain-plates in the middle\r\n      of it. The water, thus conducted to the centre, was drained\r\n      through into our jug. We had nearly filled it in this manner,\r\n      when, a heavy squall coming on from the northward, obliged us to\r\n      desist, as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we\r\n      could no longer keep our feet. We now went forward, and, lashing\r\n      ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before,\r\n      awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been\r\n      anticipated or would have been imagined possible under the\r\n      circumstances. At noon the wind had freshened into a two-reef\r\n      breeze, and by night into a stiff gale, accompanied with a\r\n      tremendously heavy swell. Experience having taught us, however,\r\n      the best method of arranging our lashings, we weathered this\r\n      dreary night in tolerable security, although thoroughly drenched\r\n      at almost every instant by the sea, and in momentary dread of\r\n      being washed off. Fortunately, the weather was so warm as to\r\n      render the water rather grateful than otherwise.\r\n\r\n      July 25. This morning the gale had diminished to a mere ten-knot\r\n      breeze, and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we\r\n      were able to keep ourselves dry upon the deck. To our great\r\n      grief, however, we found that two jars of our olives, as well as\r\n      the whole of our ham, had been washed overboard, in spite of the\r\n      careful manner in which they had been fastened. We determined not\r\n      to kill the tortoise as yet, and contented ourselves for the\r\n      present with a breakfast on a few of the olives, and a measure of\r\n      water each, which latter we mixed half and half, with wine,\r\n      finding great relief and strength from the mixture, without the\r\n      distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port.\r\n      The sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at\r\n      getting up provision from the storeroom. Several articles, of no\r\n      importance to us in our present situation, floated up through the\r\n      opening during the day, and were immediately washed overboard. We\r\n      also now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever, so that\r\n      we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves. On this\r\n      account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day. At noon the sun\r\n      appeared to be nearly vertical, and we had no doubt that we had\r\n      been driven down by the long succession of northward and\r\n      northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator. Toward\r\n      evening we saw several sharks, and were somewhat alarmed by the\r\n      audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us.\r\n      At one time, a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the\r\n      water, the monster actually swam in upon us, floundering for some\r\n      moments just over the companion-hatch, and striking Peters\r\n      violently with his tail. A heavy sea at length hurled him\r\n      overboard, much to our relief. In moderate weather we might have\r\n      easily captured him.\r\n\r\n      July 26. This morning, the wind having greatly abated, and the\r\n      sea not being very rough, we determined to renew our exertions in\r\n      the storeroom. After a great deal of hard labor during the whole\r\n      day, we found that nothing further was to be expected from this\r\n      quarter, the partitions of the room having been stove during the\r\n      night, and its contents swept into the hold. This discovery, as\r\n      may be supposed, filled us with despair.\r\n\r\n      July 27. The sea nearly smooth, with a light wind, and still from\r\n      the northward and westward. The sun coming out hotly in the\r\n      afternoon, we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes. Found\r\n      great relief from thirst, and much comfort otherwise, by bathing\r\n      in the sea; in this, however, we were forced to use great\r\n      caution, being afraid of sharks, several of which were seen\r\n      swimming around the brig during the day.\r\n\r\n      July 28. Good weather still. The brig now began to lie along so\r\n      alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up.\r\n      Prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency,\r\n      lashing our tortoise, waterjug, and two remaining jars of olives\r\n      as far as possible over to the windward, placing them outside the\r\n      hull below the main-chains. The sea very smooth all day, with\r\n      little or no wind.\r\n\r\n      July 29. A continuance of the same weather. Augustus’s wounded\r\n      arm began to evince symptoms of mortification. He complained of\r\n      drowsiness and excessive thirst, but no acute pain. Nothing could\r\n      be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of\r\n      the vinegar from the olives, and from this no benefit seemed to\r\n      be experienced. We did every thing in our power for his comfort,\r\n      and trebled his allowance of water.\r\n\r\n      July 30. An excessively hot day, with no wind. An enormous shark\r\n      kept close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon. We made\r\n      several unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose.\r\n      Augustus much worse, and evidently sinking as much from want of\r\n      proper nourishment as from the effect of his wounds. He\r\n      constantly prayed to be relieved from his sufferings, wishing for\r\n      nothing but death. This evening we ate the last of our olives,\r\n      and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could not\r\n      swallow it at all without the addition of wine. Determined to\r\n      kill our tortoise in the morning.\r\n\r\n      July 31. After a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue, owing to\r\n      the position of the hulk, we set about killing and cutting up our\r\n      tortoise. He proved to be much smaller than we had supposed,\r\n      although in good condition,—the whole meat about him not\r\n      amounting to more than ten pounds. With a view of preserving a\r\n      portion of this as long as possible, we cut it into fine pieces,\r\n      and filled with them our three remaining olive jars and the\r\n      wine-bottle (all of which had been kept), pouring in afterward\r\n      the vinegar from the olives. In this manner we put away about\r\n      three pounds of the tortoise, intending not to touch it until we\r\n      had consumed the rest. We concluded to restrict ourselves to\r\n      about four ounces of the meat per day; the whole would thus last\r\n      us thirteen days. A brisk shower, with severe thunder and\r\n      lightning, came on about dusk, but lasted so short a time that we\r\n      only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water. The whole\r\n      of this, by common consent, was given to Augustus, who now\r\n      appeared to be in the last extremity. He drank the water from the\r\n      sheet as we caught it (we holding it above him as he lay so as to\r\n      let it run into his mouth), for we had now nothing left capable\r\n      of holding water, unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from\r\n      the carboy, or the stale water from the jug. Either of these\r\n      expedients would have been resorted to had the shower lasted.\r\n\r\n      The sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the\r\n      draught. His arm was completely black from the wrist to the\r\n      shoulder, and his feet were like ice. We expected every moment to\r\n      see him breathe his last. He was frightfully emaciated; so much\r\n      so that, although he weighed a hundred and twenty-seven pounds\r\n      upon his leaving Nantucket, he now did not weigh more than forty\r\n      or fifty at the farthest. His eyes were sunk far in his head,\r\n      being scarcely perceptible, and the skin of his cheeks hung so\r\n      loosely as to prevent his masticating any food, or even\r\n      swallowing any liquid, without great difficulty.\r\n\r\n      August 1. A continuance of the same calm weather, with an\r\n      oppressively hot sun. Suffered exceedingly from thirst, the water\r\n      in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin. We\r\n      contrived, nevertheless, to swallow a portion of it by mixing it\r\n      with wine; our thirst, however, was but little abated. We found\r\n      more relief by bathing in the sea, but could not avail ourselves\r\n      of this expedient except at long intervals, on account of the\r\n      continual presence of sharks. We now saw clearly that Augustus\r\n      could not be saved; that he was evidently dying. We could do\r\n      nothing to relieve his sufferings, which appeared to be great.\r\n      About twelve o’clock he expired in strong convulsions, and\r\n      without having spoken for several hours. His death filled us with\r\n      the most gloomy forebodings, and had so great an effect upon our\r\n      spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole\r\n      day, and never addressed each other except in a whisper. It was\r\n      not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and\r\n      throw the body overboard. It was then loathsome beyond\r\n      expression, and so far decayed that, as Peters attempted to lift\r\n      it, an entire leg came off in his grasp. As the mass of\r\n      putrefaction slipped over the vessel’s side into the water, the\r\n      glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly\r\n      discovered to us seven or eight large sharks, the clashing of\r\n      whose horrible teeth, as their prey was torn to pieces among\r\n      them, might have been heard at the distance of a mile. We shrunk\r\n      within ourselves in the extremity of horror at the sound.\r\n\r\n      August 2. The same fearfully calm and hot weather. The dawn found\r\n      us in a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion.\r\n      The water in the jug was now absolutely useless, being a thick\r\n      gelatinous mass; nothing but frightful-looking worms mingled with\r\n      slime. We threw it out, and washed the jug well in the sea,\r\n      afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our bottles of\r\n      pickled tortoise. Our thirst could now scarcely be endured, and\r\n      we tried in vain to relieve it by wine, which seemed only to add\r\n      fuel to the flame, and excited us to a high degree of\r\n      intoxication. We afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings\r\n      by mixing the wine with seawater; but this instantly brought\r\n      about the most violent retchings, so that we never again\r\n      attempted it. During the whole day we anxiously sought an\r\n      opportunity of bathing, but to no purpose; for the hulk was now\r\n      entirely besieged on all sides with sharks—no doubt the identical\r\n      monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the evening\r\n      before, and who were in momentary expectation of another similar\r\n      feast. This circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret and\r\n      filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings. We\r\n      had experienced indescribable relief in bathing, and to have this\r\n      resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could\r\n      bear. Nor, indeed, were we altogether free from the apprehension\r\n      of immediate danger, for the least slip or false movement would\r\n      have thrown us at once within reach of those voracious fish, who\r\n      frequently thrust themselves directly upon us, swimming up to\r\n      leeward. No shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them.\r\n      Even when one of the largest was struck with an axe by Peters and\r\n      much wounded, he persisted in his attempts to push in where we\r\n      were. A cloud came up at dusk, but, to our extreme anguish,\r\n      passed over without discharging itself. It is quite impossible to\r\n      conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period. We passed a\r\n      sleepless night, both on this account and through dread of the\r\n      sharks.\r\n\r\n      August 3. No prospect of relief, and the brig lying still more\r\n      and more along, so that now we could not maintain a footing upon\r\n      deck at all. Busied ourselves in securing our wine and\r\n      tortoise-meat, so that we might not lose them in the event of our\r\n      rolling over. Got out two stout spikes from the forechains, and,\r\n      by means of the axe, drove them into the hull to windward within\r\n      a couple of feet of the water, this not being very far from the\r\n      keel, as we were nearly upon our beam-ends. To these spikes we\r\n      now lashed our provisions, as being more secure than their former\r\n      position beneath the chains. Suffered great agony from thirst\r\n      during the whole day—no chance of bathing on account of the\r\n      sharks, which never left us for a moment. Found it impossible to\r\n      sleep.\r\n\r\n      August 4. A little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was\r\n      heeling over, and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off\r\n      by the movement. At first the roll was slow and gradual, and we\r\n      contrived to clamber over to windward very well, having taken the\r\n      precaution to leave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven\r\n      in for the provision. But we had not calculated sufficiently upon\r\n      the acceleration of the impetus; for, presently the heel became\r\n      too violent to allow of our keeping pace with it; and, before\r\n      either of us knew what was to happen, we found ourselves hurled\r\n      furiously into the sea, and struggling several fathoms beneath\r\n      the surface, with the huge hull immediately above us.\r\n\r\n      In going under the water I had been obliged to let go my hold\r\n      upon the rope; and finding that I was completely beneath the\r\n      vessel, and my strength nearly exhausted, I scarcely made a\r\n      struggle for life, and resigned myself, in a few seconds, to die.\r\n      But here again I was deceived, not having taken into\r\n      consideration the natural rebound of the hull to windward. The\r\n      whirl of the water upward, which the vessel occasioned in rolling\r\n      partially back, brought me to the surface still more violently\r\n      than I had been plunged beneath. Upon coming up I found myself\r\n      about twenty yards from the hulk, as near as I could judge. She\r\n      was lying keel up, rocking furiously from side to side, and the\r\n      sea in all directions around was much agitated, and full of\r\n      strong whirlpools. I could see nothing of Peters. An oil-cask was\r\n      floating within a few feet of me, and various other articles from\r\n      the brig were scattered about.\r\n\r\n      My principal terror was now on account of the sharks, which I\r\n      knew to be in my vicinity. In order to deter these, if possible,\r\n      from approaching me, I splashed the water vigorously with both\r\n      hands and feet as I swam towards the hulk, creating a body of\r\n      foam. I have no doubt that to this expedient, simple as it was, I\r\n      was indebted for my preservation; for the sea all round the brig,\r\n      just before her rolling over, was so crowded with these monsters,\r\n      that I must have been, and really was, in actual contact with\r\n      some of them during my progress. By great good fortune, however,\r\n      I reached the side of the vessel in safety, although so utterly\r\n      weakened by the violent exertion I had used that I should never\r\n      have been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of\r\n      Peters, who, now, to my great joy, made his appearance (having\r\n      scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hull), and\r\n      threw me the end of a rope—one of those which had been attached\r\n      to the spikes.\r\n\r\n      Having barely escaped this danger, our attention was now directed\r\n      to the dreadful imminency of another—that of absolute starvation.\r\n      Our whole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of\r\n      all our care in securing it; and seeing no longer the remotest\r\n      possibility of obtaining more, we gave way both of us to despair,\r\n      weeping aloud like children, and neither of us attempting to\r\n      offer consolation to the other. Such weakness can scarcely be\r\n      conceived, and to those who have never been similarly situated\r\n      will, no doubt, appear unnatural; but it must be remembered that\r\n      our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of\r\n      privation and terror to which we had been subjected, that we\r\n      could not justly be considered, at that period, in the light of\r\n      rational beings. In subsequent perils, nearly as great, if not\r\n      greater, I bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my\r\n      situation, and Peters, it will be seen, evinced a stoical\r\n      philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike\r\n      supineness and imbecility—the mental condition made the\r\n      difference.\r\n\r\n      The overturning of the brig, even with the consequent loss of the\r\n      wine and turtle, would not, in fact, have rendered our situation\r\n      more deplorable than before, except for the disappearance of the\r\n      bedclothes by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch\r\n      rainwater, and of the jug in which we had kept it when caught;\r\n      for we found the whole bottom, from within two or three feet of\r\n      the bends as far as the keel, together with the keel itself,\r\n      thickly covered with large barnacles, which proved to be\r\n      excellent and highly nutritious food. Thus, in two important\r\n      respects, the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved to be a\r\n      benefit rather than an injury; it had opened to us a supply of\r\n      provisions which we could not have exhausted, using it\r\n      moderately, in a month; and it had greatly contributed to our\r\n      comfort as regards position, we being much more at ease, and in\r\n      infinitely less danger, than before.\r\n\r\n      The difficulty, however, of now obtaining water blinded us to all\r\n      the benefits of the change in our condition. That we might be\r\n      ready to avail ourselves, as far as possible, of any shower which\r\n      might fall we took off our shirts, to make use of them as we had\r\n      of the sheets—not hoping, of course, to get more in this way,\r\n      even under the most favorable circumstances, than half a gill at\r\n      a time. No signs of a cloud appeared during the day, and the\r\n      agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable. At night, Peters\r\n      obtained about an hour’s disturbed sleep, but my intense\r\n      sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single\r\n      moment.\r\n\r\n      August 5. To-day, a gentle breeze springing up carried us through\r\n      a vast quantity of seaweed, among which we were so fortunate as\r\n      to find eleven small crabs, which afforded us several delicious\r\n      meals. Their shells being quite soft, we ate them entire, and\r\n      found that they irritated our thirst far less than the barnacles.\r\n      Seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed, we also ventured to\r\n      bathe, and remained in the water for four or five hours, during\r\n      which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our thirst.\r\n      Were greatly refreshed, and spent the night somewhat more\r\n      comfortably than before, both of us snatching a little sleep.\r\n\r\n      August 6. This day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain,\r\n      lasting from about noon until after dark. Bitterly did we now\r\n      regret the loss of our jug and carboy; for, in spite of the\r\n      little means we had of catching the water, we might have filled\r\n      one, if not both of them. As it was, we contrived to satisfy the\r\n      cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to become saturated,\r\n      and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid trickle\r\n      into our mouths. In this occupation we passed the entire day.\r\n\r\n      August 7. Just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a\r\n      sail to the eastward, and _evidently coming towards us!_ We\r\n      hailed the glorious sight with a long, although feeble shout of\r\n      rapture; and began instantly to make every signal in our power,\r\n      by flaring the shirts in the air, leaping as high as our weak\r\n      condition would permit, and even by hallooing with all the\r\n      strength of our lungs, although the vessel could not have been\r\n      less than fifteen miles distant. However, she still continued to\r\n      near our hulk, and we felt that, if she but held her present\r\n      course, she must eventually come so close as to perceive us. In\r\n      about an hour after we first discovered her, we could clearly see\r\n      the people on her decks. She was a long, low, and rakish-looking\r\n      topsail schooner, with a black ball in her foretopsail, and had,\r\n      apparently, a full crew. We now became alarmed, for we could\r\n      hardly imagine it possible that she did not observe us, and were\r\n      apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as we were—an\r\n      act of fiendish barbarity, which, however incredible it may\r\n      appear, has been repeatedly perpetuated at sea, under\r\n      circumstances very nearly similar, and by beings who were\r\n      regarded as belonging to the human species. {*2} In this\r\n      instance, however, by the mercy of God, we were destined to be\r\n      most happily deceived; for, presently we were aware of a sudden\r\n      commotion on the deck of the stranger, who immediately afterward\r\n      ran up a British flag, and, hauling her wind, bore up directly\r\n      upon us. In half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin.\r\n      She proved to be the Jane Guy, of Liverpool, Captain Guy, bound\r\n      on a sealing and trading voyage to the South Seas and Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14\r\n\r\n\r\n      The _Jane Guy_ was a fine-looking topsail schooner of a hundred\r\n      and eighty tons burden. She was unusually sharp in the bows, and\r\n      on a wind, in moderate weather, the fastest sailer I have ever\r\n      seen. Her qualities, however, as a rough sea-boat, were not so\r\n      good, and her draught of water was by far too great for the trade\r\n      to which she was destined. For this peculiar service, a larger\r\n      vessel, and one of a light proportionate draught, is\r\n      desirable—say a vessel of from three hundred to three hundred and\r\n      fifty tons. She should be bark-rigged, and in other respects of a\r\n      different construction from the usual South Sea ships. It is\r\n      absolutely necessary that she should be well armed. She should\r\n      have, say ten or twelve twelve-pound carronades, and two or three\r\n      long twelves, with brass blunderbusses, and water-tight\r\n      arm-chests for each top. Her anchors and cables should be of far\r\n      greater strength than is required for any other species of trade,\r\n      and, above all, her crew should be numerous and efficient—not\r\n      less, for such a vessel as I have described, than fifty or sixty\r\n      able-bodied men. The Jane Guy had a crew of thirty-five, all able\r\n      seamen, besides the captain and mate, but she was not altogether\r\n      as well armed or otherwise equipped, as a navigator acquainted\r\n      with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have\r\n      desired.\r\n\r\n      Captain Guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner, and of\r\n      considerable experience in the southern traffic, to which he had\r\n      devoted a great portion of his life. He was deficient, however,\r\n      in energy, and, consequently, in that spirit of enterprise which\r\n      is here so absolutely requisite. He was part owner of the vessel\r\n      in which he sailed, and was invested with discretionary powers to\r\n      cruise in the South Seas for any cargo which might come most\r\n      readily to hand. He had on board, as usual in such voyages,\r\n      beads, looking-glasses, tinder-works, axes, hatchets, saws,\r\n      adzes, planes, chisels, gouges, gimlets, files, spokeshaves,\r\n      rasps, hammers, nails, knives, scissors, razors, needles, thread,\r\n      crockery-ware, calico, trinkets, and other similar articles.\r\n\r\n      The schooner sailed from Liverpool on the tenth of July, crossed\r\n      the Tropic of Cancer on the twenty-fifth, in longitude twenty\r\n      degrees west, and reached Sal, one of the Cape Verd islands, on\r\n      the twenty-ninth, where she took in salt and other necessaries\r\n      for the voyage. On the third of August, she left the Cape Verds\r\n      and steered southwest, stretching over toward the coast of\r\n      Brazil, so as to cross the equator between the meridians of\r\n      twenty-eight and thirty degrees west longitude. This is the\r\n      course usually taken by vessels bound from Europe to the Cape of\r\n      Good Hope, or by that route to the East Indies. By proceeding\r\n      thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which\r\n      continually prevail on the coast of Guinea, while, in the end, it\r\n      is found to be the shortest track, as westerly winds are never\r\n      wanting afterward by which to reach the Cape. It was Captain\r\n      Guy’s intention to make his first stoppage at Kerguelen’s Land—I\r\n      hardly know for what reason. On the day we were picked up the\r\n      schooner was off Cape St. Roque, in longitude thirty-one degrees\r\n      west; so that, when found, we had drifted probably, from north to\r\n      south, _not less than five-and-twenty degrees!_\r\n\r\n      On board the Jane Guy we were treated with all the kindness our\r\n      distressed situation demanded. In about a fortnight, during which\r\n      time we continued steering to the southeast, with gentle breezes\r\n      and fine weather, both Peters and myself recovered entirely from\r\n      the effects of our late privation and dreadful sufferings, and we\r\n      began to remember what had passed rather as a frightful dream\r\n      from which we had been happily awakened, than as events which had\r\n      taken place in sober and naked reality. I have since found that\r\n      this species of partial oblivion is usually brought about by\r\n      sudden transition, whether from joy to sorrow or from sorrow to\r\n      joy—the degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the degree\r\n      of difference in the exchange. Thus, in my own case, I now feel\r\n      it impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which I\r\n      endured during the days spent upon the hulk. The incidents are\r\n      remembered, but not the feelings which the incidents elicited at\r\n      the time of their occurrence. I only know, that when they did\r\n      occur, I then thought human nature could sustain nothing more of\r\n      agony.\r\n\r\n      We continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of\r\n      greater moment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships,\r\n      and more frequently with the black or right whale, so called in\r\n      contradistinction to the spermaceti. These, however, were chiefly\r\n      found south of the twenty-fifth parallel. On the sixteenth of\r\n      September, being in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, the\r\n      schooner encountered her first gale of any violence since leaving\r\n      Liverpool. In this neighborhood, but more frequently to the south\r\n      and east of the promontory (we were to the westward), navigators\r\n      have often to contend with storms from the northward, which rage\r\n      with great fury. They always bring with them a heavy sea, and one\r\n      of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping\r\n      round of the wind, an occurrence almost certain to take place\r\n      during the greatest force of the gale. A perfect hurricane will\r\n      be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast, and in\r\n      the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction,\r\n      while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a\r\n      violence almost inconceivable. A bright spot to the southward is\r\n      the sure forerunner of the change, and vessels are thus enabled\r\n      to take the proper precautions.\r\n\r\n      It was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a\r\n      white squall, and, as usual, from the northward. By eight it had\r\n      increased very much, and brought down upon us one of the most\r\n      tremendous seas I had then ever beheld. Every thing had been made\r\n      as snug as possible, but the schooner laboured excessively, and\r\n      gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat, pitching her\r\n      forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest difficulty\r\n      struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another.\r\n      Just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the\r\n      look-out made its appearance in the southwest, and in an hour\r\n      afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping\r\n      listlessly against the mast. In two minutes more, in spite of\r\n      every preparation, we were hurled on our beam-ends, as if by\r\n      magic, and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over\r\n      us as we lay. The blow from the southwest, however, luckily\r\n      proved to be nothing more than a squall, and we had the good\r\n      fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar. A heavy\r\n      cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this, but\r\n      toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as\r\n      before the gale. Captain Guy considered that he had made an\r\n      escape little less than miraculous.\r\n\r\n      On the thirteenth of October we came in sight of Prince Edward’s\r\n      Island, in latitude 46 degrees 53’ S., longitude 37 degrees 46’\r\n      E. Two days afterward we found ourselves near Possession Island,\r\n      and presently passed the islands of Crozet, in latitude 42\r\n      degrees 59’ S., longitude 48 degrees E. On the eighteenth we made\r\n      Kerguelen’s or Desolation Island, in the Southern Indian Ocean,\r\n      and came to anchor in Christmas Harbour, having four fathoms of\r\n      water.\r\n\r\n      This island, or rather group of islands, bears southeast from the\r\n      Cape of Good Hope, and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred\r\n      leagues. It was first discovered in 1772, by the Baron de\r\n      Kergulen, or Kerguelen, a Frenchman, who, thinking the land to\r\n      form a portion of an extensive southern continent carried home\r\n      information to that effect, which produced much excitement at the\r\n      time. The government, taking the matter up, sent the baron back\r\n      in the following year for the purpose of giving his new discovery\r\n      a critical examination, when the mistake was discovered. In 1777,\r\n      Captain Cook fell in with the same group, and gave to the\r\n      principal one the name of Desolation Island, a title which it\r\n      certainly well deserves. Upon approaching the land, however, the\r\n      navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise, as the sides of\r\n      most of the hills, from September to March, are clothed with very\r\n      brilliant verdure. This deceitful appearance is caused by a small\r\n      plant resembling saxifrage, which is abundant, growing in large\r\n      patches on a species of crumbling moss. Besides this plant there\r\n      is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the island, if we except some\r\n      coarse rank grass near the harbor, some lichen, and a shrub which\r\n      bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed, and which has\r\n      a bitter and acrid taste.\r\n\r\n      The face of the country is hilly, although none of the hills can\r\n      be called lofty. Their tops are perpetually covered with snow.\r\n      There are several harbors, of which Christmas Harbour is the most\r\n      convenient. It is the first to be met with on the northeast side\r\n      of the island after passing Cape Francois, which forms the\r\n      northern shore, and, by its peculiar shape, serves to distinguish\r\n      the harbour. Its projecting point terminates in a high rock,\r\n      through which is a large hole, forming a natural arch. The\r\n      entrance is in latitude 48 degrees 40’ S., longitude 69 degrees\r\n      6’ E. Passing in here, good anchorage may be found under the\r\n      shelter of several small islands, which form a sufficient\r\n      protection from all easterly winds. Proceeding on eastwardly from\r\n      this anchorage you come to Wasp Bay, at the head of the harbour.\r\n      This is a small basin, completely landlocked, into which you can\r\n      go with four fathoms, and find anchorage in from ten to three,\r\n      hard clay bottom. A ship might lie here with her best bower ahead\r\n      all the year round without risk. To the westward, at the head of\r\n      Wasp Bay, is a small stream of excellent water, easily procured.\r\n\r\n      Some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on\r\n      Kerguelen’s Island, and sea elephants abound. The feathered\r\n      tribes are discovered in great numbers. Penguins are very plenty,\r\n      and of these there are four different kinds. The royal penguin,\r\n      so called from its size and beautiful plumage, is the largest.\r\n      The upper part of the body is usually gray, sometimes of a lilac\r\n      tint; the under portion of the purest white imaginable. The head\r\n      is of a glossy and most brilliant black, the feet also. The chief\r\n      beauty of plumage, however, consists in two broad stripes of a\r\n      gold color, which pass along from the head to the breast. The\r\n      bill is long, and either pink or bright scarlet. These birds walk\r\n      erect; with a stately carriage. They carry their heads high with\r\n      their wings drooping like two arms, and, as their tails project\r\n      from their body in a line with the legs, the resemblance to a\r\n      human figure is very striking, and would be apt to deceive the\r\n      spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the evening. The\r\n      royal penguins which we met with on Kerguelen’s Land were rather\r\n      larger than a goose. The other kinds are the macaroni, the\r\n      jackass, and the rookery penguin. These are much smaller, less\r\n      beautiful in plumage, and different in other respects.\r\n\r\n      Besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found, among\r\n      which may be mentioned sea-hens, blue peterels, teal, ducks, Port\r\n      Egmont hens, shags, Cape pigeons, the nelly, sea swallows, terns,\r\n      sea gulls, Mother Carey’s chickens, Mother Carey’s geese, or the\r\n      great peterel, and, lastly, the albatross.\r\n\r\n      The great peterel is as large as the common albatross, and is\r\n      carnivorous. It is frequently called the break-bones, or osprey\r\n      peterel. They are not at all shy, and, when properly cooked, are\r\n      palatable food. In flying they sometimes sail very close to the\r\n      surface of the water, with the wings expanded, without appearing\r\n      to move them in the least degree, or make any exertion with them\r\n      whatever.\r\n\r\n      The albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the South Sea\r\n      birds. It is of the gull species, and takes its prey on the wing,\r\n      never coming on land except for the purpose of breeding. Between\r\n      this bird and the penguin the most singular friendship exists.\r\n      Their nests are constructed with great uniformity upon a plan\r\n      concerted between the two species—that of the albatross being\r\n      placed in the centre of a little square formed by the nests of\r\n      four penguins. Navigators have agreed in calling an assemblage of\r\n      such encampments a rookery. These rookeries have been often\r\n      described, but as my readers may not all have seen these\r\n      descriptions, and as I shall have occasion hereafter to speak of\r\n      the penguin and albatross, it will not be amiss to say something\r\n      here of their mode of building and living.\r\n\r\n      When the season for incubation arrives, the birds assemble in\r\n      vast numbers, and for some days appear to be deliberating upon\r\n      the proper course to be pursued. At length they proceed to\r\n      action. A level piece of ground is selected, of suitable extent,\r\n      usually comprising three or four acres, and situated as near the\r\n      sea as possible, being still beyond its reach. The spot is chosen\r\n      with reference to its evenness of surface, and that is preferred\r\n      which is the least encumbered with stones. This matter being\r\n      arranged, the birds proceed, with one accord, and actuated\r\n      apparently by one mind, to trace out, with mathematical accuracy,\r\n      either a square or other parallelogram, as may best suit the\r\n      nature of the ground, and of just sufficient size to accommodate\r\n      easily all the birds assembled, and no more—in this particular\r\n      seeming determined upon preventing the access of future\r\n      stragglers who have not participated in the labor of the\r\n      encampment. One side of the place thus marked out runs parallel\r\n      with the water’s edge, and is left open for ingress or egress.\r\n\r\n      Having defined the limits of the rookery, the colony now begin to\r\n      clear it of every species of rubbish, picking up stone by stone,\r\n      and carrying them outside of the lines, and close by them, so as\r\n      to form a wall on the three inland sides. Just within this wall a\r\n      perfectly level and smooth walk is formed, from six to eight feet\r\n      wide, and extending around the encampment—thus serving the\r\n      purpose of a general promenade.\r\n\r\n      The next process is to partition out the whole area into small\r\n      squares exactly equal in size. This is done by forming narrow\r\n      paths, very smooth, and crossing each other at right angles\r\n      throughout the entire extent of the rookery. At each intersection\r\n      of these paths the nest of an albatross is constructed, and a\r\n      penguin’s nest in the centre of each square—thus every penguin is\r\n      surrounded by four albatrosses, and each albatross by a like\r\n      number of penguins. The penguin’s nest consists of a hole in the\r\n      earth, very shallow, being only just of sufficient depth to keep\r\n      her single egg from rolling. The albatross is somewhat less\r\n      simple in her arrangements, erecting a hillock about a foot high\r\n      and two in diameter. This is made of earth, seaweed, and shells.\r\n      On its summit she builds her nest.\r\n\r\n      The birds take especial care never to leave their nests\r\n      unoccupied for an instant during the period of incubation, or,\r\n      indeed, until the young progeny are sufficiently strong to take\r\n      care of themselves. While the male is absent at sea in search of\r\n      food, the female remains on duty, and it is only upon the return\r\n      of her partner that she ventures abroad. The eggs are never left\r\n      uncovered at all—while one bird leaves the nest the other\r\n      nestling in by its side. This precaution is rendered necessary by\r\n      the thieving propensities prevalent in the rookery, the\r\n      inhabitants making no scruple to purloin each other’s eggs at\r\n      every good opportunity.\r\n\r\n      Although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and\r\n      albatross are the sole population, yet in most of them a variety\r\n      of oceanic birds are to be met with, enjoying all the privileges\r\n      of citizenship, and scattering their nests here and there,\r\n      wherever they can find room, never interfering, however, with the\r\n      stations of the larger species. The appearance of such\r\n      encampments, when seen from a distance, is exceedingly singular.\r\n      The whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with\r\n      the immense number of the albatross (mingled with the smaller\r\n      tribes) which are continually hovering over it, either going to\r\n      the ocean or returning home. At the same time a crowd of penguins\r\n      are to be observed, some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys,\r\n      and some marching with the military strut so peculiar to them,\r\n      around the general promenade ground which encircles the rookery.\r\n      In short, survey it as we will, nothing can be more astonishing\r\n      than the spirit of reflection evinced by these feathered beings,\r\n      and nothing surely can be better calculated to elicit reflection\r\n      in every well-regulated human intellect.\r\n\r\n      On the morning after our arrival in Christmas Harbour the chief\r\n      mate, Mr. Patterson, took the boats, and (although it was\r\n      somewhat early in the season) went in search of seal, leaving the\r\n      captain and a young relation of his on a point of barren land to\r\n      the westward, they having some business, whose nature I could not\r\n      ascertain, to transact in the interior of the island. Captain Guy\r\n      took with him a bottle, in which was a sealed letter, and made\r\n      his way from the point on which he was set on shore toward one of\r\n      the highest peaks in the place. It is probable that his design\r\n      was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he\r\n      expected to come after him. As soon as we lost sight of him we\r\n      proceeded (Peters and myself being in the mate’s boat) on our\r\n      cruise around the coast, looking for seal. In this business we\r\n      were occupied about three weeks, examining with great care every\r\n      nook and corner, not only of Kerguelen’s Land, but of the several\r\n      small islands in the vicinity. Our labours, however, were not\r\n      crowned with any important success. We saw a great many fur seal,\r\n      but they were exceedingly shy, and with the greatest exertions,\r\n      we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all. Sea\r\n      elephants were abundant, especially on the western coast of the\r\n      mainland, but of these we killed only twenty, and this with great\r\n      difficulty. On the smaller islands we discovered a good many of\r\n      the hair seal, but did not molest them. We returned to the\r\n      schooner on the eleventh, where we found Captain Guy and his\r\n      nephew, who gave a very bad account of the interior, representing\r\n      it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the\r\n      world. They had remained two nights on the island, owing to some\r\n      misunderstanding, on the part of the second mate, in regard to\r\n      the sending a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15\r\n\r\n\r\n      On the twelfth we made sail from Christmas Harbour retracing our\r\n      way to the westward, and leaving Marion’s Island, one of Crozet’s\r\n      group, on the larboard. We afterward passed Prince Edward’s\r\n      Island, leaving it also on our left, then, steering more to the\r\n      northward, made, in fifteen days, the islands of Tristan\r\n      d’Acunha, in latitude 37 degrees 8’ S, longitude 12 degrees 8’ W.\r\n\r\n      This group, now so well known, and which consists of three\r\n      circular islands, was first discovered by the Portuguese, and was\r\n      visited afterward by the Dutch in 1643, and by the French in\r\n      1767. The three islands together form a triangle, and are distant\r\n      from each other about ten miles, there being fine open passages\r\n      between. The land in all of them is very high, especially in\r\n      Tristan d’Acunha, properly so called. This is the largest of the\r\n      group, being fifteen miles in circumference, and so elevated that\r\n      it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or\r\n      ninety miles. A part of the land toward the north rises more than\r\n      a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea. A tableland at this\r\n      height extends back nearly to the centre of the island, and from\r\n      this tableland arises a lofty cone like that of Teneriffe. The\r\n      lower half of this cone is clothed with trees of good size, but\r\n      the upper region is barren rock, usually hidden among the clouds,\r\n      and covered with snow during the greater part of the year. There\r\n      are no shoals or other dangers about the island, the shores being\r\n      remarkably bold and the water deep. On the northwestern coast is\r\n      a bay, with a beach of black sand where a landing with boats can\r\n      be easily effected, provided there be a southerly wind. Plenty of\r\n      excellent water may here be readily procured; also cod and other\r\n      fish may be taken with hook and line.\r\n\r\n      The next island in point of size, and the most westwardly of the\r\n      group, is that called the Inaccessible. Its precise situation is\r\n      37 degrees 17’ S. latitude, longitude 12 degrees 24’ W. It is\r\n      seven or eight miles in circumference, and on all sides presents\r\n      a forbidding and precipitous aspect. Its top is perfectly flat,\r\n      and the whole region is sterile, nothing growing upon it except a\r\n      few stunted shrubs.\r\n\r\n      Nightingale Island, the smallest and most southerly, is in\r\n      latitude 37 degrees 26’ S., longitude 12 degrees 12’ W. Off its\r\n      southern extremity is a high ledge of rocky islets; a few also of\r\n      a similar appearance are seen to the northeast. The ground is\r\n      irregular and sterile, and a deep valley partially separates it.\r\n\r\n      The shores of these islands abound, in the proper season, with\r\n      sea lions, sea elephants, the hair and fur seal, together with a\r\n      great variety of oceanic birds. Whales are also plenty in their\r\n      vicinity. Owing to the ease with which these various animals were\r\n      here formerly taken, the group has been much visited since its\r\n      discovery. The Dutch and French frequented it at a very early\r\n      period. In 1790, Captain Patten, of the ship Industry, of\r\n      Philadelphia, made Tristan d’Acunha, where he remained seven\r\n      months (from August, 1790, to April, 1791) for the purpose of\r\n      collecting sealskins. In this time he gathered no less than five\r\n      thousand six hundred, and says that he would have had no\r\n      difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks. Upon\r\n      his arrival he found no quadrupeds, with the exception of a few\r\n      wild goats; the island now abounds with all our most valuable\r\n      domestic animals, which have been introduced by subsequent\r\n      navigators.\r\n\r\n      I believe it was not long after Captain Patten’s visit that\r\n      Captain Colquhoun, of the American brig Betsey, touched at the\r\n      largest of the islands for the purpose of refreshment. He planted\r\n      onions, potatoes, cabbages, and a great many other vegetables, an\r\n      abundance of all which is now to be met with.\r\n\r\n      In 1811, a Captain Haywood, in the Nereus, visited Tristan. He\r\n      found there three Americans, who were residing upon the island to\r\n      prepare sealskins and oil. One of these men was named Jonathan\r\n      Lambert, and he called himself the sovereign of the country. He\r\n      had cleared and cultivated about sixty acres of land, and turned\r\n      his attention to raising the coffee-plant and sugar-cane, with\r\n      which he had been furnished by the American Minister at Rio\r\n      Janeiro. This settlement, however, was finally abandoned, and in\r\n      1817 the islands were taken possession of by the British\r\n      Government, who sent a detachment for that purpose from the Cape\r\n      of Good Hope. They did not, however, retain them long; but, upon\r\n      the evacuation of the country as a British possession, two or\r\n      three English families took up their residence there\r\n      independently of the Government. On the twenty-fifth of March,\r\n      1824, the Berwick, Captain Jeffrey, from London to Van Diemen’s\r\n      Land, arrived at the place, where they found an Englishman of the\r\n      name of Glass, formerly a corporal in the British artillery. He\r\n      claimed to be supreme governor of the islands, and had under his\r\n      control twenty-one men and three women. He gave a very favourable\r\n      account of the salubrity of the climate and of the productiveness\r\n      of the soil. The population occupied themselves chiefly in\r\n      collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil, with which they traded\r\n      to the Cape of Good Hope, Glass owning a small schooner. At the\r\n      period of our arrival the governor was still a resident, but his\r\n      little community had multiplied, there being fifty-six persons\r\n      upon Tristan, besides a smaller settlement of seven on\r\n      Nightingale Island. We had no difficulty in procuring almost\r\n      every kind of refreshment which we required—sheep, hogs,\r\n      bullocks, rabbits, poultry, goats, fish in great variety, and\r\n      vegetables were abundant. Having come to anchor close in with the\r\n      large island, in eighteen fathoms, we took all we wanted on board\r\n      very conveniently. Captain Guy also purchased of Glass five\r\n      hundred sealskins and some ivory. We remained here a week, during\r\n      which the prevailing winds were from the northward and westward,\r\n      and the weather somewhat hazy. On the fifth of November we made\r\n      sail to the southward and westward, with the intention of having\r\n      a thorough search for a group of islands called the Auroras,\r\n      respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has\r\n      existed.\r\n\r\n      These islands are said to have been discovered as early as 1762,\r\n      by the commander of the ship Aurora. In 1790, Captain Manuel de\r\n      Oyarvido, in the ship Princess, belonging to the Royal Philippine\r\n      Company, sailed, as he asserts, directly among them. In 1794, the\r\n      Spanish corvette Atrevida went with the determination of\r\n      ascertaining their precise situation, and, in a paper published\r\n      by the Royal Hydrographical Society of Madrid in the year 1809,\r\n      the following language is used respecting this expedition: “The\r\n      corvette Atrevida practised, in their immediate vicinity, from\r\n      the twenty-first to the twenty-seventh of January, all the\r\n      necessary observations, and measured by chronometers the\r\n      difference of longitude between these islands and the port of\r\n      Soledad in the Manillas. The islands are three, they are very\r\n      nearly in the same meridian; the centre one is rather low, and\r\n      the other two may be seen at nine leagues’ distance.” The\r\n      observations made on board the Atrevida give the following\r\n      results as the precise situation of each island. The most\r\n      northern is in latitude 52 degrees 37’ 24” S., longitude 47\r\n      degrees, 43’ 15” W.; the middle one in latitude 53 degrees 2’ 40”\r\n      S., longitude 47 degrees 55’ 15” W.; and the most southern in\r\n      latitude 53 degrees 15’ 22” S., longitude 47 degrees 57’ 15” W.\r\n\r\n      On the twenty-seventh of January, 1820, Captain James Weddel, of\r\n      the British navy, sailed from Staten Land also in search of the\r\n      Auroras. He reports that, having made the most diligent search\r\n      and passed not only immediately over the spots indicated by the\r\n      commander of the Atrevida, but in every direction throughout the\r\n      vicinity of these spots, he could discover no indication of land.\r\n      These conflicting statements have induced other navigators to\r\n      look out for the islands; and, strange to say, while some have\r\n      sailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie\r\n      without finding them, there have been not a few who declare\r\n      positively that they have seen them; and even been close in with\r\n      their shores. It was Captain Guy’s intention to make every\r\n      exertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in\r\n      dispute. {*3}\r\n\r\n      We kept on our course, between the south and west, with variable\r\n      weather, until the twentieth of the month, when we found\r\n      ourselves on the debated ground, being in latitude 53 degrees 15’\r\n      S., longitude 47 degrees 58’ W.—that is to say, very nearly upon\r\n      the spot indicated as the situation of the most southern of the\r\n      group. Not perceiving any sign of land, we continued to the\r\n      westward of the parallel of fifty-three degrees south, as far as\r\n      the meridian of fifty degrees west. We then stood to the north as\r\n      far as the parallel of fifty-two degrees south, when we turned to\r\n      the eastward, and kept our parallel by double altitudes, morning\r\n      and evening, and meridian altitudes of the planets and moon.\r\n      Having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western coast\r\n      of Georgia, we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude\r\n      from which we set out. We then took diagonal courses throughout\r\n      the entire extent of sea circumscribed, keeping a lookout\r\n      constantly at the masthead, and repeating our examination with\r\n      the greatest care for a period of three weeks, during which the\r\n      weather was remarkably pleasant and fair, with no haze\r\n      whatsoever. Of course we were thoroughly satisfied that, whatever\r\n      islands might have existed in this vicinity at any former period,\r\n      no vestige of them remained at the present day. Since my return\r\n      home I find that the same ground was traced over, with equal\r\n      care, in 1822, by Captain Johnson, of the American schooner\r\n      Henry, and by Captain Morrell in the American schooner Wasp—in\r\n      both cases with the same result as in our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16\r\n\r\n\r\n      It had been Captain Guy’s original intention, after satisfying\r\n      himself about the Auroras, to proceed through the Strait of\r\n      Magellan, and up along the western coast of Patagonia; but\r\n      information received at Tristan d’Acunha induced him to steer to\r\n      the southward, in the hope of falling in with some small islands\r\n      said to lie about the parallel of 60 degrees S., longitude 41\r\n      degrees 20’ W. In the event of his not discovering these lands,\r\n      he designed, should the season prove favourable, to push on\r\n      toward the pole. Accordingly, on the twelfth of December, we made\r\n      sail in that direction. On the eighteenth we found ourselves\r\n      about the station indicated by Glass, and cruised for three days\r\n      in that neighborhood without finding any traces of the islands he\r\n      had mentioned. On the twenty-first, the weather being unusually\r\n      pleasant, we again made sail to the southward, with the\r\n      resolution of penetrating in that course as far as possible.\r\n      Before entering upon this portion of my narrative, it may be as\r\n      well, for the information of those readers who have paid little\r\n      attention to the progress of discovery in these regions, to give\r\n      some brief account of the very few attempts at reaching the\r\n      southern pole which have hitherto been made.\r\n\r\n      That of Captain Cook was the first of which we have any distinct\r\n      account. In 1772 he sailed to the south in the Resolution,\r\n      accompanied by Lieutenant Furneaux in the Adventure. In December\r\n      he found himself as far as the fifty-eighth parallel of south\r\n      latitude, and in longitude 26 degrees 57’ E. Here he met with\r\n      narrow fields of ice, about eight or ten inches thick, and\r\n      running northwest and southeast. This ice was in large cakes, and\r\n      usually it was packed so closely that the vessel had great\r\n      difficulty in forcing a passage. At this period Captain Cook\r\n      supposed, from the vast number of birds to be seen, and from\r\n      other indications, that he was in the near vicinity of land. He\r\n      kept on to the southward, the weather being exceedingly cold,\r\n      until he reached the sixty-fourth parallel, in longitude 38\r\n      degrees 14’ E. Here he had mild weather, with gentle breezes, for\r\n      five days, the thermometer being at thirty-six. In January, 1773,\r\n      the vessels crossed the Antarctic circle, but did not succeed in\r\n      penetrating much farther; for upon reaching latitude 67 degrees\r\n      15’ they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of\r\n      ice, extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye\r\n      could reach. This ice was of every variety—and some large floes\r\n      of it, miles in extent, formed a compact mass, rising eighteen or\r\n      twenty feet above the water. It being late in the season, and no\r\n      hope entertained of rounding these obstructions, Captain Cook now\r\n      reluctantly turned to the northward.\r\n\r\n      In the November following he renewed his search in the Antarctic.\r\n      In latitude 59 degrees 40’ he met with a strong current setting\r\n      to the southward. In December, when the vessels were in latitude\r\n      67 degrees 31’, longitude 142 degrees 54’ W., the cold was\r\n      excessive, with heavy gales and fog. Here also birds were\r\n      abundant; the albatross, the penguin, and the peterel especially.\r\n      In latitude 70 degrees 23’ some large islands of ice were\r\n      encountered, and shortly afterward the clouds to the southward\r\n      were observed to be of a snowy whiteness, indicating the vicinity\r\n      of field ice. In latitude 71 degrees 10’, longitude 106 degrees\r\n      54’ W., the navigators were stopped, as before, by an immense\r\n      frozen expanse, which filled the whole area of the southern\r\n      horizon. The northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken,\r\n      so firmly wedged together as to be utterly impassible, and\r\n      extending about a mile to the southward. Behind it the frozen\r\n      surface was comparatively smooth for some distance, until\r\n      terminated in the extreme background by gigantic ranges of ice\r\n      mountains, the one towering above the other. Captain Cook\r\n      concluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was\r\n      joined to a continent. Mr. J. N. Reynolds, whose great exertions\r\n      and perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot\r\n      a national expedition, partly for the purpose of exploring these\r\n      regions, thus speaks of the attempt of the Resolution. “We are\r\n      not surprised that Captain Cook was unable to go beyond 71\r\n      degrees 10’, but we are astonished that he did attain that point\r\n      on the meridian of 106 degrees 54’ west longitude. Palmer’s Land\r\n      lies south of the Shetland, latitude sixty-four degrees, and\r\n      tends to the southward and westward farther than any navigator\r\n      has yet penetrated. Cook was standing for this land when his\r\n      progress was arrested by the ice; which, we apprehend, must\r\n      always be the case in that point, and so early in the season as\r\n      the sixth of January—and we should not be surprised if a portion\r\n      of the icy mountains described was attached to the main body of\r\n      Palmer’s Land, or to some other portions of land lying farther to\r\n      the southward and westward.”\r\n\r\n      In 1803, Captains Kreutzenstern and Lisiausky were dispatched by\r\n      Alexander of Russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the\r\n      globe. In endeavouring to get south, they made no farther than 59\r\n      degrees 58’, in longitude 70 degrees 15’ W. They here met with\r\n      strong currents setting eastwardly. Whales were abundant, but\r\n      they saw no ice. In regard to this voyage, Mr. Reynolds observes\r\n      that, if Kreutzenstern had arrived where he did earlier in the\r\n      season, he must have encountered ice—it was March when he reached\r\n      the latitude specified. The winds, prevailing, as they do, from\r\n      the southward and westward, had carried the floes, aided by\r\n      currents, into that icy region bounded on the north by Georgia,\r\n      east by Sandwich Land and the South Orkneys, and west by the\r\n      South Shetland islands.\r\n\r\n      In 1822, Captain James Weddell, of the British navy, with two\r\n      very small vessels, penetrated farther to the south than any\r\n      previous navigator, and this, too, without encountering\r\n      extraordinary difficulties. He states that although he was\r\n      frequently hemmed in by ice before reaching the seventy-second\r\n      parallel, yet, upon attaining it, not a particle was to be\r\n      discovered, and that, upon arriving at the latitude of 74 degrees\r\n      15’, no fields, and only three islands of ice were visible. It is\r\n      somewhat remarkable that, although vast flocks of birds were\r\n      seen, and other usual indications of land, and although, south of\r\n      the Shetlands, unknown coasts were observed from the masthead\r\n      tending southwardly, Weddell discourages the idea of land\r\n      existing in the polar regions of the south.\r\n\r\n      On the 11th of January, 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell, of the\r\n      American schooner Wasp, sailed from Kerguelen’s Land with a view\r\n      of penetrating as far south as possible. On the first of February\r\n      he found himself in latitude 64 degrees 52’ S., longitude 118\r\n      degrees 27’ E. The following passage is extracted from his\r\n      journal of that date. “The wind soon freshened to an eleven-knot\r\n      breeze, and we embraced this opportunity of making to the west;\r\n      being however convinced that the farther we went south beyond\r\n      latitude sixty-four degrees, the less ice was to be apprehended,\r\n      we steered a little to the southward, until we crossed the\r\n      Antarctic circle, and were in latitude 69 degrees 15’ E. In this\r\n      latitude there was no field ice, and very few ice islands in\r\n      sight.”\r\n\r\n      Under the date of March fourteenth I find also this entry. “The\r\n      sea was now entirely free of field ice, and there were not more\r\n      than a dozen ice islands in sight. At the same time the\r\n      temperature of the air and water was at least thirteen degrees\r\n      higher (more mild) than we had ever found it between the\r\n      parallels of sixty and sixty-two south. We were now in latitude\r\n      70 degrees 14’ S., and the temperature of the air was\r\n      forty-seven, and that of the water forty-four. In this situation\r\n      I found the variation to be 14 degrees 27’ easterly, per\r\n      azimuth.... I have several times passed within the Antarctic\r\n      circle, on different meridians, and have uniformly found the\r\n      temperature, both of the air and the water, to become more and\r\n      more mild the farther I advanced beyond the sixty-fifth degree of\r\n      south latitude, and that the variation decreases in the same\r\n      proportion. While north of this latitude, say between sixty and\r\n      sixty-five south, we frequently had great difficulty in finding a\r\n      passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable\r\n      ice islands, some of which were from one to two miles in\r\n      circumference, and more than five hundred feet above the surface\r\n      of the water.”\r\n\r\n      Being nearly destitute of fuel and water, and without proper\r\n      instruments, it being also late in the season, Captain Morrell\r\n      was now obliged to put back, without attempting any further\r\n      progress to the westward, although an entirely open, sea lay\r\n      before him. He expresses the opinion that, had not these\r\n      overruling considerations obliged him to retreat, he could have\r\n      penetrated, if not to the pole itself, at least to the\r\n      eighty-fifth parallel. I have given his ideas respecting these\r\n      matters somewhat at length, that the reader may have an\r\n      opportunity of seeing how far they were borne out by my own\r\n      subsequent experience.\r\n\r\n      In 1831, Captain Briscoe, in the employ of the Messieurs Enderby,\r\n      whale-ship owners of London, sailed in the brig Lively for the\r\n      South Seas, accompanied by the cutter Tula. On the twenty-eighth\r\n      of February, being in latitude 66 degrees 30’ S., longitude 47\r\n      degrees 31’ E., he descried land, and “clearly discovered through\r\n      the snow the black peaks of a range of mountains running E. S.\r\n      E.” He remained in this neighbourhood during the whole of the\r\n      following month, but was unable to approach the coast nearer than\r\n      within ten leagues, owing to the boisterous state of the weather.\r\n      Finding it impossible to make further discovery during this\r\n      season, he returned northward to winter in Van Diemen’s Land.\r\n\r\n      In the beginning of 1832 he again proceeded southwardly, and on\r\n      the fourth of February land was seen to the southeast in latitude\r\n      67 degrees 15’ longitude 69 degrees 29’ W. This was soon found to\r\n      be an island near the headland of the country he had first\r\n      discovered. On the twenty-first of the month he succeeded in\r\n      landing on the latter, and took possession of it in the name of\r\n      William IV, calling it Adelaide’s Island, in honour of the\r\n      English queen. These particulars being made known to the Royal\r\n      Geographical Society of London, the conclusion was drawn by that\r\n      body “that there is a continuous tract of land extending from 47\r\n      degrees 30’ E. to 69 degrees 29’ W. longitude, running the\r\n      parallel of from sixty-six to sixty-seven degrees south\r\n      latitude.” In respect to this conclusion Mr. Reynolds observes:\r\n      “In the correctness of it we by no means concur; nor do the\r\n      discoveries of Briscoe warrant any such indifference. It was\r\n      within these limits that Weddel proceeded south on a meridian to\r\n      the east of Georgia, Sandwich Land, and the South Orkney and\r\n      Shetland islands.” My own experience will be found to testify\r\n      most directly to the falsity of the conclusion arrived at by the\r\n      society.\r\n\r\n      These are the principal attempts which have been made at\r\n      penetrating to a high southern latitude, and it will now be seen\r\n      that there remained, previous to the voyage of the Jane, nearly\r\n      three hundred degrees of longitude in which the Antarctic circle\r\n      had not been crossed at all. Of course a wide field lay before us\r\n      for discovery, and it was with feelings of most intense interest\r\n      that I heard Captain Guy express his resolution of pushing boldly\r\n      to the southward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17\r\n\r\n\r\n      We kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the\r\n      search for Glass’s islands, without meeting with any ice at all.\r\n      On the twenty-sixth, at noon, we were in latitude 63 degrees 23’\r\n      S., longitude 41 degrees 25’ W. We now saw several large ice\r\n      islands, and a floe of field ice, not, however, of any great\r\n      extent. The winds generally blew from the southeast, or the\r\n      northeast, but were very light. Whenever we had a westerly wind,\r\n      which was seldom, it was invariably attended with a rain squall.\r\n      Every day we had more or less snow. The thermometer, on the\r\n      twenty-seventh stood at thirty-five.\r\n\r\n      January 1, 1828.—This day we found ourselves completely hemmed in\r\n      by the ice, and our prospects looked cheerless indeed. A strong\r\n      gale blew, during the whole forenoon, from the northeast, and\r\n      drove large cakes of the drift against the rudder and counter\r\n      with such violence that we all trembled for the consequences.\r\n      Toward evening, the gale still blowing with fury, a large field\r\n      in front separated, and we were enabled, by carrying a press of\r\n      sail to force a passage through the smaller flakes into some open\r\n      water beyond. As we approached this space we took in sail by\r\n      degrees, and having at length got clear, lay-to under a single\r\n      reefed foresail.\r\n\r\n      January 2.—We had now tolerably pleasant weather. At noon we\r\n      found ourselves in latitude 69 degrees 10’ S, longitude 42\r\n      degrees 20’ W, having crossed the Antarctic circle. Very little\r\n      ice was to be seen to the southward, although large fields of it\r\n      lay behind us. This day we rigged some sounding gear, using a\r\n      large iron pot capable of holding twenty gallons, and a line of\r\n      two hundred fathoms. We found the current setting to the north,\r\n      about a quarter of a mile per hour. The temperature of the air\r\n      was now about thirty-three. Here we found the variation to be 14\r\n      degrees 28’ easterly, per azimuth.\r\n\r\n      January 5.—We had still held on to the southward without any very\r\n      great impediments. On this morning, however, being in latitude 73\r\n      degrees 15’ E., longitude 42 degrees 10’ W, we were again brought\r\n      to a stand by an immense expanse of firm ice. We saw,\r\n      nevertheless, much open water to the southward, and felt no doubt\r\n      of being able to reach it eventually. Standing to the eastward\r\n      along the edge of the floe, we at length came to a passage of\r\n      about a mile in width, through which we warped our way by\r\n      sundown. The sea in which we now were was thickly covered with\r\n      ice islands, but had no field ice, and we pushed on boldly as\r\n      before. The cold did not seem to increase, although we had snow\r\n      very frequently, and now and then hail squalls of great violence.\r\n      Immense flocks of the albatross flew over the schooner this day,\r\n      going from southeast to northwest.\r\n\r\n      January 7.—The sea still remained pretty well open, so that we\r\n      had no difficulty in holding on our course. To the westward we\r\n      saw some icebergs of incredible size, and in the afternoon passed\r\n      very near one whose summit could not have been less than four\r\n      hundred fathoms from the surface of the ocean. Its girth was\r\n      probably, at the base, three-quarters of a league, and several\r\n      streams of water were running from crevices in its sides. We\r\n      remained in sight of this island two days, and then only lost it\r\n      in a fog.\r\n\r\n      January 10.—Early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a\r\n      man overboard. He was an American named Peter Vredenburgh, a\r\n      native of New York, and was one of the most valuable hands on\r\n      board the schooner. In going over the bows his foot slipped, and\r\n      he fell between two cakes of ice, never rising again. At noon of\r\n      this day we were in latitude 78 degrees 30’, longitude 40 degrees\r\n      15’ W. The cold was now excessive, and we had hail squalls\r\n      continually from the northward and eastward. In this direction\r\n      also we saw several more immense icebergs, and the whole horizon\r\n      to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice, rising\r\n      in tiers, one mass above the other. Some driftwood floated by\r\n      during the evening, and a great quantity of birds flew over,\r\n      among which were nellies, peterels, albatrosses, and a large bird\r\n      of a brilliant blue plumage. The variation here, per azimuth, was\r\n      less than it had been previously to our passing the Antarctic\r\n      circle.\r\n\r\n      January 12.—Our passage to the south again looked doubtful, as\r\n      nothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one\r\n      apparently limitless floe, backed by absolute mountains of ragged\r\n      ice, one precipice of which arose frowningly above the other. We\r\n      stood to the westward until the fourteenth, in the hope of\r\n      finding an entrance.\r\n\r\n      January 14.—This morning we reached the western extremity of the\r\n      field which had impeded us, and, weathering it, came to an open\r\n      sea, without a particle of ice. Upon sounding with two hundred\r\n      fathoms, we here found a current setting southwardly at the rate\r\n      of half a mile per hour. The temperature of the air was\r\n      forty-seven, that of the water thirty-four. We now sailed to the\r\n      southward without meeting any interruption of moment until the\r\n      sixteenth, when, at noon, we were in latitude 81 degrees 21’,\r\n      longitude 42 degrees W. We here again sounded, and found a\r\n      current setting still southwardly, and at the rate of three\r\n      quarters of a mile per hour. The variation per azimuth had\r\n      diminished, and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant,\r\n      the thermometer being as high as fifty-one. At this period not a\r\n      particle of ice was to be discovered. All hands on board now felt\r\n      certain of attaining the pole.\r\n\r\n      January 17.—This day was full of incident. Innumerable flights of\r\n      birds flew over us from the southward, and several were shot from\r\n      the deck, one of them, a species of pelican, proved to be\r\n      excellent eating. About midday a small floe of ice was seen from\r\n      the masthead off the larboard bow, and upon it there appeared to\r\n      be some large animal. As the weather was good and nearly calm,\r\n      Captain Guy ordered out two of the boats to see what it was. Dirk\r\n      Peters and myself accompanied the mate in the larger boat. Upon\r\n      coming up with the floe, we perceived that it was in the\r\n      possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the Arctic bear,\r\n      but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals. Being\r\n      well armed, we made no scruple of attacking it at once. Several\r\n      shots were fired in quick succession, the most of which took\r\n      effect, apparently, in the head and body. Nothing discouraged,\r\n      however, the monster threw himself from the ice, and swam with\r\n      open jaws, to the boat in which were Peters and myself. Owing to\r\n      the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of\r\n      the adventure, no person was ready immediately with a second\r\n      shot, and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his\r\n      vast bulk across our gunwale, and seizing one of the men by the\r\n      small of his back, before any efficient means were taken to repel\r\n      him. In this extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of\r\n      Peters saved us from destruction. Leaping upon the back of the\r\n      huge beast, he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck,\r\n      reaching the spinal marrow at a blow. The brute tumbled into the\r\n      sea lifeless, and without a struggle, rolling over Peters as he\r\n      fell. The latter soon recovered himself, and a rope being thrown\r\n      him, he secured the carcass before entering the boat. We then\r\n      returned in triumph to the schooner, towing our trophy behind us.\r\n      This bear, upon admeasurement, proved to be full fifteen feet in\r\n      his greatest length. His wool was perfectly white, and very\r\n      coarse, curling tightly. The eyes were of a blood red, and larger\r\n      than those of the Arctic bear, the snout also more rounded,\r\n      rather resembling the snout of the bulldog. The meat was tender,\r\n      but excessively rank and fishy, although the men devoured it with\r\n      avidity, and declared it excellent eating.\r\n\r\n      Scarcely had we got our prize alongside, when the man at the\r\n      masthead gave the joyful shout of “land on the starboard bow!”\r\n      All hands were now upon the alert, and, a breeze springing up\r\n      very opportunely from the northward and eastward, we were soon\r\n      close in with the coast. It proved to be a low rocky islet, of\r\n      about a league in circumference, and altogether destitute of\r\n      vegetation, if we except a species of prickly pear. In\r\n      approaching it from the northward, a singular ledge of rock is\r\n      seen projecting into the sea, and bearing a strong resemblance to\r\n      corded bales of cotton. Around this ledge to the westward is a\r\n      small bay, at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient\r\n      landing.\r\n\r\n      It did not take us long to explore every portion of the island,\r\n      but, with one exception, we found nothing worthy of our\r\n      observation. In the southern extremity, we picked up near the\r\n      shore, half buried in a pile of loose stones, a piece of wood,\r\n      which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe. There had been\r\n      evidently some attempt at carving upon it, and Captain Guy\r\n      fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise, but the\r\n      resemblance did not strike me very forcibly. Besides this prow,\r\n      if such it were, we found no other token that any living creature\r\n      had ever been here before. Around the coast we discovered\r\n      occasional small floes of ice—but these were very few. The exact\r\n      situation of the islet (to which Captain Guy gave the name of\r\n      Bennet’s Islet, in honour of his partner in the ownership of the\r\n      schooner) is 82 degrees 50’ S. latitude, 42 degrees 20’ W.\r\n      longitude.\r\n\r\n      We had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees\r\n      farther than any previous navigators, and the sea still lay\r\n      perfectly open before us. We found, too, that the variation\r\n      uniformly decreased as we proceeded, and, what was still more\r\n      surprising, that the temperature of the air, and latterly of the\r\n      water, became milder. The weather might even be called pleasant,\r\n      and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some\r\n      northern point of the compass. The sky was usually clear, with\r\n      now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern\r\n      horizon—this, however, was invariably of brief duration. Two\r\n      difficulties alone presented themselves to our view; we were\r\n      getting short of fuel, and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among\r\n      several of the crew. These considerations began to impress upon\r\n      Captain Guy the necessity of returning, and he spoke of it\r\n      frequently. For my own part, confident as I was of soon arriving\r\n      at land of some description upon the course we were pursuing, and\r\n      having every reason to believe, from present appearances, that we\r\n      should not find it the sterile soil met with in the higher Arctic\r\n      latitudes, I warmly pressed upon him the expediency of\r\n      persevering, at least for a few days longer, in the direction we\r\n      were now holding. So tempting an opportunity of solving the great\r\n      problem in regard to an Antarctic continent had never yet been\r\n      afforded to man, and I confess that I felt myself bursting with\r\n      indignation at the timid and ill-timed suggestions of our\r\n      commander. I believe, indeed, that what I could not refrain from\r\n      saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to push\r\n      on. While, therefore, I cannot but lament the most unfortunate\r\n      and bloody events which immediately arose from my advice, I must\r\n      still be allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having\r\n      been instrumental, however remotely, in opening to the eye of\r\n      science one of the most intensely exciting secrets which has ever\r\n      engrossed its attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18\r\n\r\n\r\n      January 18.—This morning {*4} we continued to the southward, with\r\n      the same pleasant weather as before. The sea was entirely smooth,\r\n      the air tolerably warm and from the northeast, the temperature of\r\n      the water fifty-three. We now again got our sounding-gear in\r\n      order, and, with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line, found the\r\n      current setting toward the pole at the rate of a mile an hour.\r\n      This constant tendency to the southward, both in the wind and\r\n      current, caused some degree of speculation, and even of alarm, in\r\n      different quarters of the schooner, and I saw distinctly that no\r\n      little impression had been made upon the mind of Captain Guy. He\r\n      was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule, however, and I finally\r\n      succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions. The variation\r\n      was now very trivial. In the course of the day we saw several\r\n      large whales of the right species, and innumerable flights of the\r\n      albatross passed over the vessel. We also picked up a bush, full\r\n      of red berries, like those of the hawthorn, and the carcass of a\r\n      singular-looking land-animal. It was three feet in length, and\r\n      but six inches in height, with four very short legs, the feet\r\n      armed with long claws of a brilliant scarlet, and resembling\r\n      coral in substance. The body was covered with a straight silky\r\n      hair, perfectly white. The tail was peaked like that of a rat,\r\n      and about a foot and a half long. The head resembled a cat’s,\r\n      with the exception of the ears—these were flopped like the ears\r\n      of a dog. The teeth were of the same brilliant scarlet as the\r\n      claws.\r\n\r\n      January 19.—To-day, being in latitude 83 degrees 20’, longitude\r\n      43 degrees 5’ W. (the sea being of an extraordinarily dark\r\n      colour), we again saw land from the masthead, and, upon a closer\r\n      scrutiny, found it to be one of a group of very large islands.\r\n      The shore was precipitous, and the interior seemed to be well\r\n      wooded, a circumstance which occasioned us great joy. In about\r\n      four hours from our first discovering the land we came to anchor\r\n      in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from the coast, as a high\r\n      surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered a nearer\r\n      approach of doubtful expediency. The two largest boats were now\r\n      ordered out, and a party, well armed (among whom were Peters and\r\n      myself), proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which\r\n      appeared to encircle the island. After searching about for some\r\n      time, we discovered an inlet, which we were entering, when we saw\r\n      four large canoes put off from the shore, filled with men who\r\n      seemed to be well armed. We waited for them to come up, and, as\r\n      they moved with great rapidity, they were soon within hail.\r\n      Captain Guy now held up a white handkerchief on the blade of an\r\n      oar, when the strangers made a full stop, and commenced a loud\r\n      jabbering all at once, intermingled with occasional shouts, in\r\n      which we could distinguish the words Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama!\r\n      They continued this for at least half an hour, during which we\r\n      had a good opportunity of observing their appearance.\r\n\r\n      In the four canoes, which might have been fifty feet long and\r\n      five broad, there were a hundred and ten savages in all. They\r\n      were about the ordinary stature of Europeans, but of a more\r\n      muscular and brawny frame. Their complexion a jet black, with\r\n      thick and long woolly hair. They were clothed in skins of an\r\n      unknown black animal, shaggy and silky, and made to fit the body\r\n      with some degree of skill, the hair being inside, except where\r\n      turned out about the neck, wrists, and ankles. Their arms\r\n      consisted principally of clubs, of a dark, and apparently very\r\n      heavy wood. Some spears, however, were observed among them,\r\n      headed with flint, and a few slings. The bottoms of the canoes\r\n      were full of black stones about the size of a large egg.\r\n\r\n      When they had concluded their harangue (for it was clear they\r\n      intended their jabbering for such), one of them who seemed to be\r\n      the chief stood up in the prow of his canoe, and made signs for\r\n      us to bring our boats alongside of him. This hint we pretended\r\n      not to understand, thinking it the wiser plan to maintain, if\r\n      possible, the interval between us, as their number more than\r\n      quadrupled our own. Finding this to be the case, the chief\r\n      ordered the three other canoes to hold back, while he advanced\r\n      toward us with his own. As soon as he came up with us he leaped\r\n      on board the largest of our boats, and seated himself by the side\r\n      of Captain Guy, pointing at the same time to the schooner, and\r\n      repeating the word Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! We now put back to\r\n      the vessel, the four canoes following at a little distance.\r\n\r\n      Upon getting alongside, the chief evinced symptoms of extreme\r\n      surprise and delight, clapping his hands, slapping his thighs and\r\n      breast, and laughing obstreperously. His followers behind joined\r\n      in his merriment, and for some minutes the din was so excessive\r\n      as to be absolutely deafening. Quiet being at length restored,\r\n      Captain Guy ordered the boats to be hoisted up, as a necessary\r\n      precaution, and gave the chief (whose name we soon found to be\r\n      Too-wit) to understand that we could admit no more than twenty of\r\n      his men on deck at one time. With this arrangement he appeared\r\n      perfectly satisfied, and gave some directions to the canoes, when\r\n      one of them approached, the rest remaining about fifty yards off.\r\n      Twenty of the savages now got on board, and proceeded to ramble\r\n      over every part of the deck, and scramble about among the\r\n      rigging, making themselves much at home, and examining every\r\n      article with great inquisitiveness.\r\n\r\n      It was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the\r\n      white race—from whose complexion, indeed, they appeared to\r\n      recoil. They believed the Jane to be a living creature, and\r\n      seemed to be afraid of hurting it with the points of their\r\n      spears, carefully turning them up. Our crew were much amused with\r\n      the conduct of Too-wit in one instance. The cook was splitting\r\n      some wood near the galley, and, by accident, struck his axe into\r\n      the deck, making a gash of considerable depth. The chief\r\n      immediately ran up, and pushing the cook on one side rather\r\n      roughly, commenced a half whine, half howl, strongly indicative\r\n      of sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner,\r\n      patting and smoothing the gash with his hand, and washing it from\r\n      a bucket of seawater which stood by. This was a degree of\r\n      ignorance for which we were not prepared, and for my part I could\r\n      not help thinking some of it affected.\r\n\r\n      When the visitors had satisfied, as well as they could, their\r\n      curiosity in regard to our upper works, they were admitted below,\r\n      when their amazement exceeded all bounds. Their astonishment now\r\n      appeared to be far too deep for words, for they roamed about in\r\n      silence, broken only by low ejaculations. The arms afforded them\r\n      much food for speculation, and they were suffered to handle and\r\n      examine them at leisure. I do not believe that they had the least\r\n      suspicion of their actual use, but rather took them for idols,\r\n      seeing the care we had of them, and the attention with which we\r\n      watched their movements while handling them. At the great guns\r\n      their wonder was redoubled. They approached them with every mark\r\n      of the profoundest reverence and awe, but forbore to examine them\r\n      minutely. There were two large mirrors in the cabin, and here was\r\n      the acme of their amazement. Too-wit was the first to approach\r\n      them, and he had got in the middle of the cabin, with his face to\r\n      one and his back to the other, before he fairly perceived them.\r\n      Upon raising his eyes and seeing his reflected self in the glass,\r\n      I thought the savage would go mad; but, upon turning short round\r\n      to make a retreat, and beholding himself a second time in the\r\n      opposite direction, I was afraid he would expire upon the spot.\r\n      No persuasion could prevail upon him to take another look;\r\n      throwing himself upon the floor, with his face buried in his\r\n      hands, he remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon\r\n      deck.\r\n\r\n      The whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner,\r\n      twenty at a time, Too-wit being suffered to remain during the\r\n      entire period. We saw no disposition to thievery among them, nor\r\n      did we miss a single article after their departure. Throughout\r\n      the whole of their visit they evinced the most friendly manner.\r\n      There were, however, some points in their demeanour which we\r\n      found it impossible to understand; for example, we could not get\r\n      them to approach several very harmless objects—such as the\r\n      schooner’s sails, an egg, an open book, or a pan of flour. We\r\n      endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles\r\n      which might be turned to account in the way of traffic, but found\r\n      great difficulty in being comprehended. We made out,\r\n      nevertheless, what greatly astonished us, that the islands\r\n      abounded in the large tortoise of the Gallipagos, one of which we\r\n      saw in the canoe of Too-wit. We saw also some biche de mer in the\r\n      hands of one of the savages, who was greedily devouring it in its\r\n      natural state. These anomalies—for they were such when considered\r\n      in regard to the latitude—induced Captain Guy to wish for a\r\n      thorough investigation of the country, in the hope of making a\r\n      profitable speculation in his discovery. For my own part, anxious\r\n      as I was to know something more of these islands, I was still\r\n      more earnestly bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward\r\n      without delay. We had now fine weather, but there was no telling\r\n      how long it would last; and being already in the eighty-fourth\r\n      parallel, with an open sea before us, a current setting strongly\r\n      to the southward, and the wind fair, I could not listen with any\r\n      patience to a proposition of stopping longer than was absolutely\r\n      necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a\r\n      proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions. I represented to the\r\n      captain that we might easily make this group on our return, and\r\n      winter here in the event of being blocked up by the ice. He at\r\n      length came into my views (for in some way, hardly known to\r\n      myself, I had acquired much influence over him), and it was\r\n      finally resolved that, even in the event of our finding biche de\r\n      mer, we should only stay here a week to recruit, and then push on\r\n      to the southward while we might. Accordingly we made every\r\n      necessary preparation, and, under the guidance of Too-wit, got\r\n      the Jane through the reef in safety, coming to anchor about a\r\n      mile from the shore, in an excellent bay, completely landlocked,\r\n      on the southeastern coast of the main island, and in ten fathoms\r\n      of water, black sandy bottom. At the head of this bay there were\r\n      three fine springs (we were told) of good water, and we saw\r\n      abundance of wood in the vicinity. The four canoes followed us\r\n      in, keeping, however, at a respectful distance. Too-wit himself\r\n      remained on board, and, upon our dropping anchor, invited us to\r\n      accompany him on shore, and visit his village in the interior. To\r\n      this Captain Guy consented; and ten savages being left on board\r\n      as hostages, a party of us, twelve in all, got in readiness to\r\n      attend the chief. We took care to be well armed, yet without\r\n      evincing any distrust. The schooner had her guns run out, her\r\n      boarding-nettings up, and every other proper precaution was taken\r\n      to guard against surprise. Directions were left with the chief\r\n      mate to admit no person on board during our absence, and, in the\r\n      event of our not appearing in twelve hours, to send the cutter,\r\n      with a swivel, around the island in search of us.\r\n\r\n      At every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us\r\n      that we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto\r\n      visited by civilized men. We saw nothing with which we had been\r\n      formerly conversant. The trees resembled no growth of either the\r\n      torrid, the temperate, or the northern frigid zones, and were\r\n      altogether unlike those of the lower southern latitudes we had\r\n      already traversed. The very rocks were novel in their mass, their\r\n      color, and their stratification; and the streams themselves,\r\n      utterly incredible as it may appear, had so little in common with\r\n      those of other climates, that we were scrupulous of tasting them,\r\n      and, indeed, had difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that\r\n      their qualities were purely those of nature. At a small brook\r\n      which crossed our path (the first we had reached) Too-wit and his\r\n      attendants halted to drink. On account of the singular character\r\n      of the water, we refused to taste it, supposing it to be\r\n      polluted; and it was not until some time afterward we came to\r\n      understand that such was the appearance of the streams throughout\r\n      the whole group. I am at a loss to give a distinct idea of the\r\n      nature of this liquid, and cannot do so without many words.\r\n      Although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities where common\r\n      water would do so, yet never, except when falling in a cascade,\r\n      had it the customary appearance of limpidity. It was,\r\n      nevertheless, in point of fact, as perfectly limpid as any\r\n      limestone water in existence, the difference being only in\r\n      appearance. At first sight, and especially in cases where little\r\n      declivity was found, it bore resemblance, as regards consistency,\r\n      to a thick infusion of gum arabic in common water. But this was\r\n      only the least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities. It was\r\n      not colourless, nor was it of any one uniform colour—presenting\r\n      to the eye, as it flowed, every possible shade of purple; like\r\n      the hues of a changeable silk. This variation in shade was\r\n      produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment in\r\n      the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of\r\n      Too-wit. Upon collecting a basinful, and allowing it to settle\r\n      thoroughly, we perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made\r\n      up of a number of distinct veins, each of a distinct hue; that\r\n      these veins did not commingle; and that their cohesion was\r\n      perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves, and\r\n      imperfect in regard to neighbouring veins. Upon passing the blade\r\n      of a knife athwart the veins, the water closed over it\r\n      immediately, as with us, and also, in withdrawing it, all traces\r\n      of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated. If,\r\n      however, the blade was passed down accurately between the two\r\n      veins, a perfect separation was effected, which the power of\r\n      cohesion did not immediately rectify. The phenomena of this water\r\n      formed the first definite link in that vast chain of apparent\r\n      miracles with which I was destined to be at length encircled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19\r\n\r\n\r\n      We were nearly three hours in reaching the village, it being more\r\n      than nine miles in the interior, and the path lying through a\r\n      rugged country. As we passed along, the party of Too-wit (the\r\n      whole hundred and ten savages of the canoes) was momentarily\r\n      strengthened by smaller detachments, of from two to six or seven,\r\n      which joined us, as if by accident, at different turns of the\r\n      road. There appeared so much of system in this that I could not\r\n      help feeling distrust, and I spoke to Captain Guy of my\r\n      apprehensions. It was now too late, however, to recede, and we\r\n      concluded that our best security lay in evincing a perfect\r\n      confidence in the good faith of Too-wit. We accordingly went on,\r\n      keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages, and not\r\n      permitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between. In\r\n      this way, passing through a precipitous ravine, we at length\r\n      reached what we were told was the only collection of habitations\r\n      upon the island. As we came in sight of them, the chief set up a\r\n      shout, and frequently repeated the word Klock-klock, which we\r\n      supposed to be the name of the village, or perhaps the generic\r\n      name for villages.\r\n\r\n      The dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable,\r\n      and, unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with\r\n      which mankind are acquainted, were of no uniform plan. Some of\r\n      them (and these we found belonged to the Wampoos or Yampoos, the\r\n      great men of the land) consisted of a tree cut down at about four\r\n      feet from the root, with a large black skin thrown over it, and\r\n      hanging in loose folds upon the ground. Under this the savage\r\n      nestled. Others were formed by means of rough limbs of trees,\r\n      with the withered foliage upon them, made to recline, at an angle\r\n      of forty-five degrees, against a bank of clay, heaped up, without\r\n      regular form, to the height of five or six feet. Others, again,\r\n      were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly, and covered\r\n      over with similar branches, these being removed when the tenant\r\n      was about to enter, and pulled on again when he had entered. A\r\n      few were built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood, the\r\n      upper limbs being partially cut through, so as to bend over upon\r\n      the lower, thus forming thicker shelter from the weather. The\r\n      greater number, however, consisted of small shallow caverns,\r\n      apparently scratched in the face of a precipitous ledge of dark\r\n      stone, resembling fuller’s earth, with which three sides of the\r\n      village were bounded. At the door of each of these primitive\r\n      caverns was a small rock, which the tenant carefully placed\r\n      before the entrance upon leaving his residence, for what purpose\r\n      I could not ascertain, as the stone itself was never of\r\n      sufficient size to close up more than a third of the opening.\r\n\r\n      This village, if it were worthy of the name, lay in a valley of\r\n      some depth, and could only be approached from the southward, the\r\n      precipitous ledge of which I have already spoken cutting off all\r\n      access in other directions. Through the middle of the valley ran\r\n      a brawling stream of the same magical-looking water which has\r\n      been described. We saw several strange animals about the\r\n      dwellings, all appearing to be thoroughly domesticated. The\r\n      largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in the\r\n      structure of the body and snout; the tail, however, was bushy,\r\n      and the legs slender as those of the antelope. Its motion was\r\n      exceedingly awkward and indecisive, and we never saw it attempt\r\n      to run. We noticed also several animals very similar in\r\n      appearance, but of a greater length of body, and covered with a\r\n      black wool. There were a great variety of tame fowls running\r\n      about, and these seemed to constitute the chief food of the\r\n      natives. To our astonishment we saw black albatross among these\r\n      birds in a state of entire domestication, going to sea\r\n      periodically for food, but always returning to the village as a\r\n      home, and using the southern shore in the vicinity as a place of\r\n      incubation. There they were joined by their friends the pelicans\r\n      as usual, but these latter never followed them to the dwellings\r\n      of the savages. Among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks,\r\n      differing very little from the canvass-back of our own country,\r\n      black gannets, and a large bird not unlike the buzzard in\r\n      appearance, but not carnivorous. Of fish there seemed to be a\r\n      great abundance. We saw, during our visit, a quantity of dried\r\n      salmon, rock cod, blue dolphins, mackerel, blackfish, skate,\r\n      conger eels, elephantfish, mullets, soles, parrotfish,\r\n      leather-jackets, gurnards, hake, flounders, paracutas, and\r\n      innumerable other varieties. We noticed, too, that most of them\r\n      were similar to the fish about the group of Lord Auckland\r\n      Islands, in a latitude as low as fifty-one degrees south. The\r\n      Gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful. We saw but few wild\r\n      animals, and none of a large size, or of a species with which we\r\n      were familiar. One or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed\r\n      our path, but the natives paid them little attention, and we\r\n      concluded that they were not venomous.\r\n\r\n      As we approached the village with Too-wit and his party, a vast\r\n      crowd of the people rushed out to meet us, with loud shouts,\r\n      among which we could only distinguish the everlasting Anamoo-moo!\r\n      and Lama-Lama! We were much surprised at perceiving that, with\r\n      one or two exceptions, these new comers were entirely naked, and\r\n      skins being used only by the men of the canoes. All the weapons\r\n      of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the latter,\r\n      for there was no appearance of any among the villagers. There\r\n      were a great many women and children, the former not altogether\r\n      wanting in what might be termed personal beauty. They were\r\n      straight, tall, and well formed, with a grace and freedom of\r\n      carriage not to be found in civilized society. Their lips,\r\n      however, like those of the men, were thick and clumsy, so that,\r\n      even when laughing, the teeth were never disclosed. Their hair\r\n      was of a finer texture than that of the males. Among these naked\r\n      villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed,\r\n      like the party of Too-wit, in dresses of black skin, and armed\r\n      with lances and heavy clubs. These appeared to have great\r\n      influence among the rest, and were always addressed by the title\r\n      Wampoo. These, too, were the tenants of the black skin palaces.\r\n      That of Too-wit was situated in the centre of the village, and\r\n      was much larger and somewhat better constructed than others of\r\n      its kind. The tree which formed its support was cut off at a\r\n      distance of twelve feet or thereabouts from the root, and there\r\n      were several branches left just below the cut, these serving to\r\n      extend the covering, and in this way prevent its flapping about\r\n      the trunk. The covering, too, which consisted of four very large\r\n      skins fastened together with wooden skewers, was secured at the\r\n      bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground. The floor\r\n      was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet.\r\n\r\n      To this hut we were conducted with great solemnity, and as many\r\n      of the natives crowded in after us as possible. Too-wit seated\r\n      himself on the leaves, and made signs that we should follow his\r\n      example. This we did, and presently found ourselves in a\r\n      situation peculiarly uncomfortable, if not indeed critical. We\r\n      were on the ground, twelve in number, with the savages, as many\r\n      as forty, sitting on their hams so closely around us that, if any\r\n      disturbance had arisen, we should have found it impossible to\r\n      make use of our arms, or indeed to have risen to our feet. The\r\n      pressure was not only inside the tent, but outside, where\r\n      probably was every individual on the whole island, the crowd\r\n      being prevented from trampling us to death only by the incessant\r\n      exertions and vociferations of Too-wit. Our chief security lay,\r\n      however, in the presence of Too-wit himself among us, and we\r\n      resolved to stick by him closely, as the best chance of\r\n      extricating ourselves from the dilemma, sacrificing him\r\n      immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design.\r\n\r\n      After some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored, when\r\n      the chief addressed us in a speech of great length, and very\r\n      nearly resembling the one delivered in the canoes, with the\r\n      exception that the Anamoo-moos! were now somewhat more\r\n      strenuously insisted upon than the Lama-Lamas! We listened in\r\n      profound silence until the conclusion of this harangue, when\r\n      Captain Guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal\r\n      friendship and goodwill, concluding what he had to say by a\r\n      present of several strings of blue beads and a knife. At the\r\n      former the monarch, much to our surprise, turned up his nose with\r\n      some expression of contempt, but the knife gave him the most\r\n      unlimited satisfaction, and he immediately ordered dinner. This\r\n      was handed into the tent over the heads of the attendants, and\r\n      consisted of the palpitating entrails of a specialis of unknown\r\n      animal, probably one of the slim-legged hogs which we had\r\n      observed in our approach to the village. Seeing us at a loss how\r\n      to proceed, he began, by way of setting us an example, to devour\r\n      yard after yard of the enticing food, until we could positively\r\n      stand it no longer, and evinced such manifest symptoms of\r\n      rebellion of stomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of\r\n      astonishment only inferior to that brought about by the\r\n      looking-glasses. We declined, however, partaking of the\r\n      delicacies before us, and endeavoured to make him understand that\r\n      we had no appetite whatever, having just finished a hearty\r\n      dejeuner.\r\n\r\n      When the monarch had made an end of his meal, we commenced a\r\n      series of cross-questioning in every ingenious manner we could\r\n      devise, with a view of discovering what were the chief\r\n      productions of the country, and whether any of them might be\r\n      turned to profit. At length he seemed to have some idea of our\r\n      meaning, and offered to accompany us to a part of coast where he\r\n      assured us the biche de mer (pointing to a specimen of that\r\n      animal) was to be found in great abundance. We were glad of this\r\n      early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd,\r\n      and signified our eagerness to proceed. We now left the tent,\r\n      and, accompanied by the whole population of the village, followed\r\n      the chief to the southeastern extremity of the island, nor far\r\n      from the bay where our vessel lay at anchor. We waited here for\r\n      about an hour, until the four canoes were brought around by some\r\n      of the savages to our station. The whole of our party then\r\n      getting into one of them, we were paddled along the edge of the\r\n      reef before mentioned, and of another still farther out, where we\r\n      saw a far greater quantity of biche de mer than the oldest seamen\r\n      among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower latitudes\r\n      most celebrated for this article of commerce. We stayed near\r\n      these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could\r\n      easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary, when we\r\n      were taken alongside the schooner, and parted with Too-wit, after\r\n      obtaining from him a promise that he would bring us, in the\r\n      course of twenty-four hours, as many of the canvass-back ducks\r\n      and Gallipago tortoises as his canoes would hold. In the whole of\r\n      this adventure we saw nothing in the demeanour of the natives\r\n      calculated to create suspicion, with the single exception of the\r\n      systematic manner in which their party was strengthened during\r\n      our route from the schooner to the village.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20\r\n\r\n\r\n      The chief was as good as his word, and we were soon plentifully\r\n      supplied with fresh provisions. We found the tortoises as fine as\r\n      we had ever seen, and the ducks surpassed our best species of\r\n      wild fowl, being exceedingly tender, juicy, and well-flavoured.\r\n      Besides these, the savages brought us, upon our making them\r\n      comprehend our wishes, a vast quantity of brown celery and scurvy\r\n      grass, with a canoe-load of fresh fish and some dried. The celery\r\n      was a treat indeed, and the scurvy grass proved of incalculable\r\n      benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of\r\n      disease. In a very short time we had not a single person on the\r\n      sick-list. We had also plenty of other kinds of fresh provisions,\r\n      among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish resembling\r\n      the mussel in shape, but with the taste of an oyster. Shrimps,\r\n      too, and prawns were abundant, and albatross and other birds’\r\n      eggs with dark shells. We took in, too, a plentiful stock of the\r\n      flesh of the hog which I have mentioned before. Most of the men\r\n      found it a palatable food, but I thought it fishy and otherwise\r\n      disagreeable. In return for these good things we presented the\r\n      natives with blue beads, brass trinkets, nails, knives, and\r\n      pieces of red cloth, they being fully delighted in the exchange.\r\n      We established a regular market on shore, just under the guns of\r\n      the schooner, where our barterings were carried on with every\r\n      appearance of good faith, and a degree of order which their\r\n      conduct at the village of _Klock-klock_ had not led us to expect\r\n      from the savages.\r\n\r\n      Matters went on thus very amicably for several days, during which\r\n      parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner, and\r\n      parties of our men frequently on shore, making long excursions\r\n      into the interior, and receiving no molestation whatever. Finding\r\n      the ease with which the vessel might be loaded with _biche de\r\n      mer_, owing to the friendly disposition of the islanders, and the\r\n      readiness with which they would render us assistance in\r\n      collecting it, Captain Guy resolved to enter into negotiations\r\n      with Too-wit for the erection of suitable houses in which to cure\r\n      the article, and for the services of himself and tribe in\r\n      gathering as much as possible, while he himself took advantage of\r\n      the fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward. Upon\r\n      mentioning this project to the chief he seemed very willing to\r\n      enter into an agreement. A bargain was accordingly struck,\r\n      perfectly satisfactory to both parties, by which it was arranged\r\n      that, after making the necessary preparations, such as laying off\r\n      the proper grounds, erecting a portion of the buildings, and\r\n      doing some other work in which the whole of our crew would be\r\n      required, the schooner should proceed on her route, leaving three\r\n      of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of the\r\n      project, and instruct the natives in drying the _biche de mer_.\r\n      In regard to terms, these were made to depend upon the exertions\r\n      of the savages in our absence. They were to receive a stipulated\r\n      quantity of blue beads, knives, red cloth, and so forth, for\r\n      every certain number of piculs of the _biche de mer_ which should\r\n      be ready on our return.\r\n\r\n      A description of the nature of this important article of\r\n      commerce, and the method of preparing it, may prove of some\r\n      interest to my readers, and I can find no more suitable place\r\n      than this for introducing an account of it. The following\r\n      comprehensive notice of the substance is taken from a modern\r\n      history of a voyage to the South Seas.\r\n\r\n      “It is that _mollusca_ from the Indian Seas which is known to\r\n      commerce by the French name _bouche de mer_ (a nice morsel from\r\n      the sea). If I am not much mistaken, the celebrated Cuvier calls\r\n      it _gasteropeda pulmonifera_. It is abundantly gathered in the\r\n      coasts of the Pacific islands, and gathered especially for the\r\n      Chinese market, where it commands a great price, perhaps as much\r\n      as their much-talked-of edible birds’ nests, which are properly\r\n      made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a species of\r\n      swallow from the body of these molluscae. They have no shell, no\r\n      legs, nor any prominent part, except an _absorbing_ and an\r\n      _excretory_, opposite organs; but, by their elastic wings, like\r\n      caterpillars or worms, they creep in shallow waters, in which,\r\n      when low, they can be seen by a kind of swallow, the sharp bill\r\n      of which, inserted in the soft animal, draws a gummy and\r\n      filamentous substance, which, by drying, can be wrought into the\r\n      solid walls of their nest. Hence the name of _gasteropeda\r\n      pulmonifera_.\r\n\r\n      “This mollusca is oblong, and of different sizes, from three to\r\n      eighteen inches in length; and I have seen a few that were not\r\n      less than two feet long. They were nearly round, a little\r\n      flattish on one side, which lies next to the bottom of the sea;\r\n      and they are from one to eight inches thick. They crawl up into\r\n      shallow water at particular seasons of the year, probably for the\r\n      purpose of gendering, as we often find them in pairs. It is when\r\n      the sun has the most power on the water, rendering it tepid, that\r\n      they approach the shore; and they often go up into places so\r\n      shallow that, on the tide’s receding, they are left dry, exposed\r\n      to the beat of the sun. But they do not bring forth their young\r\n      in shallow water, as we never see any of their progeny, and\r\n      full-grown ones are always observed coming in from deep water.\r\n      They feed principally on that class of zoophytes which produce\r\n      the coral.\r\n\r\n      “The _biche de mer_ is generally taken in three or four feet of\r\n      water; after which they are brought on shore, and split at one\r\n      end with a knife, the incision being one inch or more, according\r\n      to the size of the mollusca. Through this opening the entrails\r\n      are forced out by pressure, and they are much like those of any\r\n      other small tenant of the deep. The article is then washed, and\r\n      afterward boiled to a certain degree, which must not be too much\r\n      or too little. They are then buried in the ground for four hours,\r\n      then boiled again for a short time, after which they are dried,\r\n      either by the fire or the sun. Those cured by the sun are worth\r\n      the most; but where one picul (133 1/3 lbs.) can be cured that\r\n      way, I can cure thirty piculs by the fire. When once properly\r\n      cured, they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years\r\n      without any risk; but they should be examined once in every few\r\n      months, say four times a year, to see if any dampness is likely\r\n      to affect them.\r\n\r\n      “The Chinese, as before stated, consider _biche de mer_ a very\r\n      great luxury, believing that it wonderfully strengthens and\r\n      nourishes the system, and renews the exhausted system of the\r\n      immoderate voluptuary. The first quality commands a high price in\r\n      Canton, being worth ninety dollars a picul; the second quality,\r\n      seventy-five dollars; the third, fifty dollars; the fourth,\r\n      thirty dollars; the fifth, twenty dollars; the sixth, twelve\r\n      dollars; the seventh, eight dollars; and the eighth, four\r\n      dollars; small cargoes, however, will often bring more in\r\n      Manilla, Singapore, and Batavia.”\r\n\r\n      An agreement having been thus entered into, we proceeded\r\n      immediately to land everything necessary for preparing the\r\n      buildings and clearing the ground. A large flat space near the\r\n      eastern shore of the bay was selected, where there was plenty of\r\n      both wood and water, and within a convenient distance of the\r\n      principal reefs on which the _biche de mer_ was to be procured.\r\n      We now all set to work in good earnest, and soon, to the great\r\n      astonishment of the savages, had felled a sufficient number of\r\n      trees for our purpose, getting them quickly in order for the\r\n      framework of the houses, which in two or three days were so far\r\n      under way that we could safely trust the rest of the work to the\r\n      three men whom we intended to leave behind. These were John\r\n      Carson, Alfred Harris, and ___ Peterson (all natives of London, I\r\n      believe), who volunteered their services in this respect.\r\n\r\n      By the last of the month we had everything in readiness for\r\n      departure. We had agreed, however, to pay a formal visit of\r\n      leave-taking to the village, and Too-wit insisted so\r\n      pertinaciously upon our keeping the promise that we did not think\r\n      it advisable to run the risk of offending him by a final refusal.\r\n      I believe that not one of us had at this time the slightest\r\n      suspicion of the good faith of the savages. They had uniformly\r\n      behaved with the greatest decorum, aiding us with alacrity in our\r\n      work, offering us their commodities, frequently without price,\r\n      and never, in any instance, pilfering a single article, although\r\n      the high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident\r\n      by the extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon\r\n      our making them a present. The women especially were most\r\n      obliging in every respect, and, upon the whole, we should have\r\n      been the most suspicious of human beings had we entertained a\r\n      single thought of perfidy on the part of a people who treated us\r\n      so well. A very short while sufficed to prove that this apparent\r\n      kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply laid plan\r\n      for our destruction, and that the islanders for whom we\r\n      entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem, were among the\r\n      most barbarous, subtle, and bloodthirsty wretches that ever\r\n      contaminated the face of the globe.\r\n\r\n      It was on the first of February that we went on shore for the\r\n      purpose of visiting the village. Although, as said before, we\r\n      entertained not the slightest suspicion, still no proper\r\n      precaution was neglected. Six men were left in the schooner, with\r\n      instructions to permit none of the savages to approach the vessel\r\n      during our absence, under any pretence whatever, and to remain\r\n      constantly on deck. The boarding-nettings were up, the guns\r\n      double-shotted with grape and canister, and the swivels loaded\r\n      with canisters of musket-balls. She lay, with her anchor apeak,\r\n      about a mile from the shore, and no canoe could approach her in\r\n      any direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the\r\n      full fire of our swivels immediately.\r\n\r\n      The six men being left on board, our shore-party consisted of\r\n      thirty-two persons in all. We were armed to the teeth, having\r\n      with us muskets, pistols, and cutlasses; besides, each had a long\r\n      kind of seaman’s knife, somewhat resembling the bowie knife now\r\n      so much used throughout our western and southern country. A\r\n      hundred of the black skin warriors met us at the landing for the\r\n      purpose of accompanying us on our way. We noticed, however, with\r\n      some surprise, that they were now entirely without arms; and,\r\n      upon questioning Too-wit in relation to this circumstance, he\r\n      merely answered that _Mattee non we pa pa si_—meaning that there\r\n      was no need of arms where all were brothers. We took this in good\r\n      part, and proceeded.\r\n\r\n      We had passed the spring and rivulet of which I before spoke, and\r\n      were now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain\r\n      of soapstone hills among which the village was situated. This\r\n      gorge was very rocky and uneven, so much so that it was with no\r\n      little difficulty we scrambled through it on our first visit to\r\n      Klock-klock. The whole length of the ravine might have been a\r\n      mile and a half, or probably two miles. It wound in every\r\n      possible direction through the hills (having apparently formed,\r\n      at some remote period, the bed of a torrent), in no instance\r\n      proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn. The\r\n      sides of this dell would have averaged, I am sure, seventy or\r\n      eighty feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of\r\n      their extent, and in some portions they arose to an astonishing\r\n      height, overshadowing the pass so completely that but little of\r\n      the light of day could penetrate. The general width was about\r\n      forty feet, and occasionally it diminished so as not to allow the\r\n      passage of more than five or six persons abreast. In short, there\r\n      could be no place in the world better adapted for the\r\n      consummation of an ambuscade, and it was no more than natural\r\n      that we should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon it.\r\n      When I now think of our egregious folly, the chief subject of\r\n      astonishment seems to be, that we should have ever ventured,\r\n      under any circumstances, so completely into the power of unknown\r\n      savages as to permit them to march both before and behind us in\r\n      our progress through this ravine. Yet such was the order we\r\n      blindly took up, trusting foolishly to the force of our party,\r\n      the unarmed condition of Too-wit and his men, the certain\r\n      efficacy of our firearms (whose effect was yet a secret to the\r\n      natives), and, more than all, to the long-sustained pretension of\r\n      friendship kept up by these infamous wretches. Five or six of\r\n      them went on before, as if to lead the way, ostentatiously\r\n      busying themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from\r\n      the path. Next came our own party. We walked closely together,\r\n      taking care only to prevent separation. Behind followed the main\r\n      body of the savages, observing unusual order and decorum.\r\n\r\n      Dirk Peters, a man named Wilson Allen, and myself were on the\r\n      right of our companions, examining, as we went along, the\r\n      singular stratification of the precipice which overhung us. A\r\n      fissure in the soft rock attracted our attention. It was about\r\n      wide enough for one person to enter without squeezing, and\r\n      extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet in a\r\n      straight course, sloping afterward to the left. The height of the\r\n      opening, is far as we could see into it from the main gorge, was\r\n      perhaps sixty or seventy feet. There were one or two stunted\r\n      shrubs growing from the crevices, bearing a species of filbert\r\n      which I felt some curiosity to examine, and pushed in briskly for\r\n      that purpose, gathering five or six of the nuts at a grasp, and\r\n      then hastily retreating. As I turned, I found that Peters and\r\n      Allen had followed me. I desired them to go back, as there was\r\n      not room for two persons to pass, saying they should have some of\r\n      my nuts. They accordingly turned, and were scrambling back, Allen\r\n      being close to the mouth of the fissure, when I was suddenly\r\n      aware of a concussion resembling nothing I had ever before\r\n      experienced, and which impressed me with a vague conception, if\r\n      indeed I then thought of anything, that the whole foundations of\r\n      the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder, and that the day of\r\n      universal dissolution was at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21\r\n\r\n\r\n      As soon as I could collect my scattered senses, I found myself\r\n      nearly suffocated, and grovelling in utter darkness among a\r\n      quantity of loose earth, which was also falling upon me heavily\r\n      in every direction, threatening to bury me entirely. Horribly\r\n      alarmed at this idea, I struggled to gain my feet, and at last\r\n      succeeded. I then remained motionless for some moments,\r\n      endeavouring to conceive what had happened to me, and where I\r\n      was. Presently I heard a deep groan just at my ear, and afterward\r\n      the smothered voice of Peters calling to me for aid in the name\r\n      of God. I scrambled one or two paces forward, when I fell\r\n      directly over the head and shoulders of my companion, who, I soon\r\n      discovered, was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his\r\n      middle, and struggling desperately to free himself from the\r\n      pressure. I tore the dirt from around him with all the energy I\r\n      could command, and at length succeeded in getting him out.\r\n\r\n      As soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise\r\n      to be capable of conversing rationally, we both came to the\r\n      conclusion that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured\r\n      had, by some convulsion of nature, or probably from their own\r\n      weight, caved in overhead, and that we were consequently lost for\r\n      ever, being thus entombed alive. For a long time we gave up\r\n      supinely to the most intense agony and despair, such as cannot be\r\n      adequately imagined by those who have never been in a similar\r\n      position. I firmly believed that no incident ever occurring in\r\n      the course of human events is more adapted to inspire the\r\n      supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case like our\r\n      own, of living inhumation. The blackness of darkness which\r\n      envelops the victim, the terrific oppression of lungs, the\r\n      stifling fumes from the damp earth, unite with the ghastly\r\n      considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of hope,\r\n      and that such is the allotted portion of the dead, to carry into\r\n      the human heart a degree of appalling awe and horror not to be\r\n      tolerated—never to be conceived.\r\n\r\n      At length Peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain\r\n      precisely the extent of our calamity, and grope about our prison;\r\n      it being barely possible, he observed, that some opening might\r\n      yet be left us for escape. I caught eagerly at this hope, and,\r\n      arousing myself to exertion, attempted to force my way through\r\n      the loose earth. Hardly had I advanced a single step before a\r\n      glimmer of light became perceptible, enough to convince me that,\r\n      at all events, we should not immediately perish for want of air.\r\n      We now took some degree of heart, and encouraged each other to\r\n      hope for the best. Having scrambled over a bank of rubbish which\r\n      impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light, we\r\n      found less difficulty in advancing and also experienced some\r\n      relief from the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented\r\n      us. Presently we were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects\r\n      around, and discovered that we were near the extremity of the\r\n      straight portion of the fissure, where it made a turn to the\r\n      left. A few struggles more, and we reached the bend, when to our\r\n      inexpressible joy, there appeared a long seam or crack extending\r\n      upward a vast distance, generally at an angle of about forty-five\r\n      degrees, although sometimes much more precipitous. We could not\r\n      see through the whole extent of this opening; but, as a good deal\r\n      of light came down it, we had little doubt of finding at the top\r\n      of it (if we could by any means reach the top) a clear passage\r\n      into the open air.\r\n\r\n      I now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure\r\n      from the main gorge, and that our companion, Allen, was still\r\n      missing; we determined at once to retrace our steps and look for\r\n      him. After a long search, and much danger from the farther caving\r\n      in of the earth above us, Peters at length cried out to me that\r\n      he had hold of our companion’s foot, and that his whole body was\r\n      deeply buried beneath the rubbish beyond the possibility of\r\n      extricating him. I soon found that what he said was too true, and\r\n      that, of course, life had been long extinct. With sorrowful\r\n      hearts, therefore, we left the corpse to its fate, and again made\r\n      our way to the bend.\r\n\r\n      The breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us, and,\r\n      after one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up, we began once\r\n      more to despair. I have before said that the chain of hills\r\n      through which ran the main gorge was composed of a species of\r\n      soft rock resembling soapstone. The sides of the cleft we were\r\n      now attempting to ascend were of the same material, and so\r\n      excessively slippery, being wet, that we could get but little\r\n      foothold upon them even in their least precipitous parts; in some\r\n      places, where the ascent was nearly perpendicular, the difficulty\r\n      was, of course, much aggravated; and, indeed, for some time we\r\n      thought insurmountable. We took courage, however, from despair,\r\n      and what, by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our\r\n      bowie knives, and swinging at the risk of our lives, to small\r\n      projecting points of a harder species of slaty rock which now and\r\n      then protruded from the general mass, we at length reached a\r\n      natural platform, from which was perceptible a patch of blue sky,\r\n      at the extremity of a thickly-wooded ravine. Looking back now,\r\n      with somewhat more leisure, at the passage through which we had\r\n      thus far proceeded, we clearly saw from the appearance of its\r\n      sides, that it was of late formation, and we concluded that the\r\n      concussion, whatever it was, which had so unexpectedly\r\n      overwhelmed us, had also, at the same moment, laid open this path\r\n      for escape. Being quite exhausted with exertion, and indeed, so\r\n      weak that we were scarcely able to stand or articulate, Peters\r\n      now proposed that we should endeavour to bring our companions to\r\n      the rescue by firing the pistols which still remained in our\r\n      girdles—the muskets as well as cutlasses had been lost among the\r\n      loose earth at the bottom of the chasm. Subsequent events proved\r\n      that, had we fired, we should have sorely repented it, but\r\n      luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by this time arisen in\r\n      my mind, and we forbore to let the savages know of our\r\n      whereabouts.\r\n\r\n      After having reposed for about an hour, we pushed on slowly up\r\n      the ravine, and had gone no great way before we heard a\r\n      succession of tremendous yells. At length we reached what might\r\n      be called the surface of the ground; for our path hitherto, since\r\n      leaving the platform, had lain beneath an archway of high rock\r\n      and foliage, at a vast distance overhead. With great caution we\r\n      stole to a narrow opening, through which we had a clear sight of\r\n      the surrounding country, when the whole dreadful secret of the\r\n      concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view.\r\n\r\n      The spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the\r\n      highest peak in the range of the soapstone hills. The gorge in\r\n      which our party of thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet\r\n      to the left of us. But, for at least one hundred yards, the\r\n      channel or bed of this gorge was entirely filled up with the\r\n      chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and stone that\r\n      had been artificially tumbled within it. The means by which the\r\n      vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than\r\n      evident, for sure traces of the murderous work were yet\r\n      remaining. In several spots along the top of the eastern side of\r\n      the gorge (we were now on the western) might be seen stakes of\r\n      wood driven into the earth. In these spots the earth had not\r\n      given way, but throughout the whole extent of the face of the\r\n      precipice from which the mass had fallen, it was clear, from\r\n      marks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the\r\n      rock blaster, that stakes similar to those we saw standing had\r\n      been inserted, at not more than a yard apart, for the length of\r\n      perhaps three hundred feet, and ranging at about ten feet back\r\n      from the edge of the gulf. Strong cords of grape vine were\r\n      attached to the stakes still remaining on the hill, and it was\r\n      evident that such cords had also been attached to each of the\r\n      other stakes. I have already spoken of the singular\r\n      stratification of these soapstone hills; and the description just\r\n      given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected\r\n      our escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of\r\n      its nature. This was such that almost every natural convulsion\r\n      would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular layers or\r\n      ridges running parallel with one another, and a very moderate\r\n      exertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same\r\n      purpose. Of this stratification the savages had availed\r\n      themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends. There can be no\r\n      doubt that, by the continuous line of stakes, a partial rupture\r\n      of the soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one\r\n      or two feet, when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each\r\n      of the cords (these cords being attached to the tops of the\r\n      stakes, and extending back from the edge of the cliff), a vast\r\n      leverage power was obtained, capable of hurling the whole face of\r\n      the hill, upon a given signal, into the bosom of the abyss below.\r\n      The fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of\r\n      uncertainty. We alone had escaped from the tempest of that\r\n      overwhelming destruction. We were the only living white men upon\r\n      the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22\r\n\r\n\r\n      Our situation, as it now appeared, was scarcely less dreadful\r\n      than when we had conceived ourselves entombed forever. We saw\r\n      before us no prospect but that of being put to death by the\r\n      savages, or of dragging out a miserable existence in captivity\r\n      among them. We might, to be sure, conceal ourselves for a time\r\n      from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills, and, as\r\n      a final resort, in the chasm from which we had just issued; but\r\n      we must either perish in the long polar winter through cold and\r\n      famine, or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain\r\n      relief.\r\n\r\n      The whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages,\r\n      crowds of whom, we now perceived, had come over from the islands\r\n      to the southward on flat rafts, doubtless with a view of lending\r\n      their aid in the capture and plunder of the Jane. The vessel\r\n      still lay calmly at anchor in the bay, those on board being\r\n      apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting them. How we\r\n      longed at that moment to be with them! either to aid in effecting\r\n      their escape, or to perish with them in attempting a defence. We\r\n      saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without\r\n      bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads, with but a\r\n      remote hope of benefit to them. A pistol fired might suffice to\r\n      apprise them that something wrong had occurred; but the report\r\n      could not possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety\r\n      lay in getting out of the harbour forthwith—it could not tell\r\n      them that no principles of honour now bound them to remain, that\r\n      their companions were no longer among the living. Upon hearing\r\n      the discharge they could not be more thoroughly prepared to meet\r\n      the foe, who were now getting ready to attack, than they already\r\n      were, and always had been. No good, therefore, and infinite harm,\r\n      would result from our firing, and after mature deliberation, we\r\n      forbore.\r\n\r\n      Our next thought was to attempt to rush toward the vessel, to\r\n      seize one of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay,\r\n      and endeavour to force a passage on board. But the utter\r\n      impossibility of succeeding in this desperate task soon became\r\n      evident. The country, as I said before, was literally swarming\r\n      with the natives, skulking among the bushes and recesses of the\r\n      hills, so as not to be observed from the schooner. In our\r\n      immediate vicinity especially, and blockading the sole path by\r\n      which we could hope to attain the shore at the proper point were\r\n      stationed the whole party of the black skin warriors, with\r\n      Too-wit at their head, and apparently only waiting for some\r\n      re-enforcement to commence his onset upon the Jane. The canoes,\r\n      too, which lay at the head of the bay, were manned with savages,\r\n      unarmed, it is true, but who undoubtedly had arms within reach.\r\n      We were forced, therefore, however unwillingly, to remain in our\r\n      place of concealment, mere spectators of the conflict which\r\n      presently ensued.\r\n\r\n      In about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts, or\r\n      flatboats, without riggers, filled with savages, and coming round\r\n      the southern bight of the harbor. They appeared to have no arms\r\n      except short clubs, and stones which lay in the bottom of the\r\n      rafts. Immediately afterward another detachment, still larger,\r\n      appeared in an opposite direction, and with similar weapons. The\r\n      four canoes, too, were now quickly filled with natives, starting\r\n      up from the bushes at the head of the bay, and put off swiftly to\r\n      join the other parties. Thus, in less time than I have taken to\r\n      tell it, and as if by magic, the Jane saw herself surrounded by\r\n      an immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing\r\n      her at all hazards.\r\n\r\n      That they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an\r\n      instant. The six men left in the vessel, however resolutely they\r\n      might engage in her defence, were altogether unequal to the\r\n      proper management of the guns, or in any manner to sustain a\r\n      contest at such odds. I could hardly imagine that they would make\r\n      resistance at all, but in this was deceived; for presently I saw\r\n      them get springs upon the cable, and bring the vessel’s starboard\r\n      broadside to bear upon the canoes, which by this time were within\r\n      pistol range, the rafts being nearly a quarter of a mile to\r\n      windward. Owing to some cause unknown, but most probably to the\r\n      agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless\r\n      a situation, the discharge was an entire failure. Not a canoe was\r\n      hit or a single savage injured, the shots striking short and\r\n      ricocheting over their heads. The only effect produced upon them\r\n      was astonishment at the unexpected report and smoke, which was so\r\n      excessive that for some moments I almost thought they would\r\n      abandon their design entirely, and return to the shore. And this\r\n      they would most likely have done had our men followed up their\r\n      broadside by a discharge of small arms, in which, as the canoes\r\n      were now so near at hand, they could not have failed in doing\r\n      some execution, sufficient, at least, to deter this party from a\r\n      farther advance, until they could have given the rafts also a\r\n      broadside. But, in place of this, they left the canoe party to\r\n      recover from their panic, and, by looking about them, to see that\r\n      no injury had been sustained, while they flew to the larboard to\r\n      get ready for the rafts.\r\n\r\n      The discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect. The\r\n      star and double-headed shot of the large guns cut seven or eight\r\n      of the rafts completely asunder, and killed, perhaps, thirty or\r\n      forty of the savages outright, while a hundred of them, at least,\r\n      were thrown into the water, the most of them dreadfully wounded.\r\n      The remainder, frightened out of their senses, commenced at once\r\n      a precipitate retreat, not even waiting to pick up their maimed\r\n      companions, who were swimming about in every direction, screaming\r\n      and yelling for aid. This great success, however, came too late\r\n      for the salvation of our devoted people. The canoe party were\r\n      already on board the schooner to the number of more than a\r\n      hundred and fifty, the most of them having succeeded in\r\n      scrambling up the chains and over the boarding-netting even\r\n      before the matches had been applied to the larboard guns. Nothing\r\n      now could withstand their brute rage. Our men were borne down at\r\n      once, overwhelmed, trodden under foot, and absolutely torn to\r\n      pieces in an instant.\r\n\r\n      Seeing this, the savages on the rafts got the better of their\r\n      fears, and came up in shoals to the plunder. In five minutes the\r\n      Jane was a pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage.\r\n      The decks were split open and ripped up; the cordage, sails, and\r\n      everything movable on deck demolished as if by magic, while, by\r\n      dint of pushing at the stern, towing with the canoes, and hauling\r\n      at the sides, as they swam in thousands around the vessel, the\r\n      wretches finally forced her on shore (the cable having been\r\n      slipped), and delivered her over to the good offices of Too-wit,\r\n      who, during the whole of the engagement, had maintained, like a\r\n      skilful general, his post of security and reconnaissance among\r\n      the hills, but, now that the victory was completed to his\r\n      satisfaction, condescended to scamper down with his warriors of\r\n      the black skin, and become a partaker in the spoils.\r\n\r\n      Too-wit’s descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding place and\r\n      reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm. At about fifty\r\n      yards from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water, at\r\n      which we slaked the burning thirst that now consumed us. Not far\r\n      from the spring we discovered several of the filbert-bushes which\r\n      I mentioned before. Upon tasting the nuts we found them\r\n      palatable, and very nearly resembling in flavour the common\r\n      English filbert. We collected our hats full immediately,\r\n      deposited them within the ravine, and returned for more. While we\r\n      were busily employed in gathering these, a rustling in the bushes\r\n      alarmed us, and we were upon the point of stealing back to our\r\n      covert, when a large black bird of the bittern species\r\n      strugglingly and slowly arose above the shrubs. I was so much\r\n      startled that I could do nothing, but Peters had sufficient\r\n      presence of mind to run up to it before it could make its escape,\r\n      and seize it by the neck. Its struggles and screams were\r\n      tremendous, and we had thoughts of letting it go, lest the noise\r\n      should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in\r\n      the neighbourhood. A stab with a bowie knife, however, at length\r\n      brought it to the ground, and we dragged it into the ravine,\r\n      congratulating ourselves that, at all events, we had thus\r\n      obtained a supply of food enough to last us for a week.\r\n\r\n      We now went out again to look about us, and ventured a\r\n      considerable distance down the southern declivity of the hill,\r\n      but met with nothing else which could serve us for food. We\r\n      therefore collected a quantity of dry wood and returned, seeing\r\n      one or two large parties of the natives on their way to the\r\n      village, laden with the plunder of the vessel, and who, we were\r\n      apprehensive, might discover us in passing beneath the hill.\r\n\r\n      Our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as\r\n      possible, and with this object, we arranged some brushwood over\r\n      the aperture which I have before spoken of as the one through\r\n      which we saw the patch of blue sky, on reaching the platform from\r\n      the interior of the chasm. We left only a very small opening just\r\n      wide enough to admit of our seeing the bay, without the risk of\r\n      being discovered from below. Having done this, we congratulated\r\n      ourselves upon the security of the position; for we were now\r\n      completely excluded from observation, as long as we chose to\r\n      remain within the ravine itself, and not venture out upon the\r\n      hill, We could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been\r\n      within this hollow; but, indeed, when we came to reflect upon the\r\n      probability that the fissure through which we attained it had\r\n      been only just now created by the fall of the cliff opposite, and\r\n      that no other way of attaining it could be perceived, we were not\r\n      so much rejoiced at the thought of being secure from molestation\r\n      as fearful lest there should be absolutely no means left us for\r\n      descent. We resolved to explore the summit of the hill\r\n      thoroughly, when a good opportunity should offer. In the meantime\r\n      we watched the motions of the savages through our loophole.\r\n\r\n      They had already made a complete wreck of the vessel, and were\r\n      now preparing to set her on fire. In a little while we saw the\r\n      smoke ascending in huge volumes from her main hatchway, and,\r\n      shortly afterward, a dense mass of flame burst up from the\r\n      forecastle. The rigging, masts and what remained of the sails\r\n      caught immediately, and the fire spread rapidly along the decks.\r\n      Still a great many of the savages retained their stations about\r\n      her, hammering with large stones, axes, and cannon balls at the\r\n      bolts and other iron and copper work. On the beach, and in canoes\r\n      and rafts, there were not less, altogether, in the immediate\r\n      vicinity of the schooner, than ten thousand natives, besides the\r\n      shoals of them who, laden with booty, were making their way\r\n      inland and over to the neighbouring islands. We now anticipated a\r\n      catastrophe, and were not disappointed. First of all there came a\r\n      smart shock (which we felt as distinctly where we were as if we\r\n      had been slightly galvanized), but unattended with any visible\r\n      signs of an explosion. The savages were evidently startled, and\r\n      paused for an instant from their labours and yellings. They were\r\n      upon the point of recommencing, when suddenly a mass of smoke\r\n      puffed up from the decks, resembling a black and heavy\r\n      thundercloud—then, as if from its bowels, arose a tall stream of\r\n      vivid fire to the height, apparently, of a quarter of a mile—then\r\n      there came a sudden circular expansion of the flame—then the\r\n      whole atmosphere was magically crowded, in a single instant, with\r\n      a wild chaos of wood, and metal, and human limbs—and, lastly,\r\n      came the concussion in its fullest fury, which hurled us\r\n      impetuously from our feet, while the hills echoed and re-echoed\r\n      the tumult, and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the\r\n      ruins tumbled headlong in every direction around us.\r\n\r\n      The havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation,\r\n      and they had now, indeed, reaped the full and perfect fruits of\r\n      their treachery. Perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion,\r\n      while at least an equal number were desperately mangled. The\r\n      whole surface of the bay was literally strewn with the struggling\r\n      and drowning wretches, and on shore matters were even worse. They\r\n      seemed utterly appalled by the suddenness and completeness of\r\n      their discomfiture, and made no efforts at assisting one another.\r\n      At length we observed a total change in their demeanour. From\r\n      absolute stupor, they appeared to be, all at once, aroused to the\r\n      highest pitch of excitement, and rushed wildly about, going to\r\n      and from a certain point on the beach, with the strangest\r\n      expressions of mingled horror, rage, and intense curiosity\r\n      depicted on their countenances, and shouting, at the top of their\r\n      voices, “Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”\r\n\r\n      Presently we saw a large body go off into the hills, whence they\r\n      returned in a short time, carrying stakes of wood. These they\r\n      brought to the station where the crowd was the thickest, which\r\n      now separated so as to afford us a view of the object of all this\r\n      excitement. We perceived something white lying upon the ground,\r\n      but could not immediately make out what it was. At length we saw\r\n      that it was the carcass of the strange animal with the scarlet\r\n      teeth and claws which the schooner had picked up at sea on the\r\n      eighteenth of January. Captain Guy had had the body preserved for\r\n      the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to England. I\r\n      remember he had given some directions about it just before our\r\n      making the island, and it had been brought into the cabin and\r\n      stowed away in one of the lockers. It had now been thrown on\r\n      shore by the explosion; but why it had occasioned so much concern\r\n      among the savages was more than we could comprehend. Although\r\n      they crowded around the carcass at a little distance, none of\r\n      them seemed willing to approach it closely. By-and-by the men\r\n      with the stakes drove them in a circle around it, and no sooner\r\n      was this arrangement completed, than the whole of the vast\r\n      assemblage rushed into the interior of the island, with loud\r\n      screams of “Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23\r\n\r\n\r\n      During the six or seven days immediately following we remained in\r\n      our hiding-place upon the hill, going out only occasionally, and\r\n      then with the greatest precaution, for water and filberts. We had\r\n      made a kind of penthouse on the platform, furnishing it with a\r\n      bed of dry leaves, and placing in it three large flat stones,\r\n      which served us for both fireplace and table. We kindled a fire\r\n      without difficulty by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together,\r\n      the one soft, the other hard. The bird we had taken in such good\r\n      season proved excellent eating, although somewhat tough. It was\r\n      not an oceanic fowl, but a species of bittern, with jet black and\r\n      grizzly plumage, and diminutive wings in proportion to its bulk.\r\n      We afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the\r\n      ravine, apparently seeking for the one we had captured; but, as\r\n      they never alighted, we had no opportunity of catching them.\r\n\r\n      As long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our\r\n      situation, but it was now entirely consumed, and it became\r\n      absolutely necessary that we should look out for provision. The\r\n      filberts would not satisfy the cravings of hunger, afflicting us,\r\n      too, with severe gripings of the bowels, and, if freely indulged\r\n      in, with violent headache. We had seen several large tortoises\r\n      near the seashore to the eastward of the hill, and perceived they\r\n      might be easily taken, if we could get at them without the\r\n      observation of the natives. It was resolved, therefore, to make\r\n      an attempt at descending.\r\n\r\n      We commenced by going down the southern declivity, which seemed\r\n      to offer the fewest difficulties, but had not proceeded a hundred\r\n      yards before (as we had anticipated from appearances on the\r\n      hilltop) our progress was entirely arrested by a branch of the\r\n      gorge in which our companions had perished. We now passed along\r\n      the edge of this for about a quarter of a mile, when we were\r\n      again stopped by a precipice of immense depth, and, not being\r\n      able to make our way along the brink of it, we were forced to\r\n      retrace our steps by the main ravine.\r\n\r\n      We now pushed over to the eastward, but with precisely similar\r\n      fortune. After an hour’s scramble, at the risk of breaking our\r\n      necks, we discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit\r\n      of black granite, with fine dust at the bottom, and whence the\r\n      only egress was by the rugged path in which we had come down.\r\n      Toiling again up this path, we now tried the northern edge of the\r\n      hill. Here we were obliged to use the greatest possible caution\r\n      in our maneuvers, as the least indiscretion would expose us to\r\n      the full view of the savages in the village. We crawled along,\r\n      therefore, on our hands and knees, and, occasionally, were even\r\n      forced to throw ourselves at full length, dragging our bodies\r\n      along by means of the shrubbery. In this careful manner we had\r\n      proceeded but a little way, when we arrived at a chasm far deeper\r\n      than any we had yet seen, and leading directly into the main\r\n      gorge. Thus our fears were fully confirmed, and we found\r\n      ourselves cut off entirely from access to the world below.\r\n      Thoroughly exhausted by our exertions, we made the best of our\r\n      way back to the platform, and throwing ourselves upon the bed of\r\n      leaves, slept sweetly and soundly for some hours.\r\n\r\n      For several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in\r\n      exploring every part of the summit of the hill, in order to\r\n      inform ourselves of its actual resources. We found that it would\r\n      afford us no food, with the exception of the unwholesome\r\n      filberts, and a rank species of scurvy grass, which grew in a\r\n      little patch of not more than four rods square, and would be soon\r\n      exhausted. On the fifteenth of February, as near as I can\r\n      remember, there was not a blade of this left, and the nuts were\r\n      growing scarce; our situation, therefore, could hardly be more\r\n      lamentable. {*5} On the sixteenth we again went round the walls\r\n      of our prison, in hope of finding some avenue of escape; but to\r\n      no purpose. We also descended the chasm in which we had been\r\n      overwhelmed, with the faint expectation of discovering, through\r\n      this channel, some opening to the main ravine. Here, too, we were\r\n      disappointed, although we found and brought up with us a musket.\r\n\r\n      On the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining\r\n      more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made\r\n      our way in the first search. We remembered that one of the\r\n      fissures in the sides of this pit had been but partially looked\r\n      into, and we were anxious to explore it, although with no\r\n      expectation of discovering here any opening.\r\n\r\n      We found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow\r\n      as before, and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some\r\n      attention. It was, indeed, one of the most singular-looking\r\n      places imaginable, and we could scarcely bring ourselves to\r\n      believe it altogether the work of nature. The pit, from its\r\n      eastern to its western extremity, was about five hundred yards in\r\n      length, when all its windings were threaded; the distance from\r\n      east to west in a straight line not being more (I should suppose,\r\n      having no means of accurate examination) than forty or fifty\r\n      yards. Upon first descending into the chasm, that is to say, for\r\n      a hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill, the sides of\r\n      the abyss bore little resemblance to each other, and, apparently,\r\n      had at no time been connected, the one surface being of the\r\n      soapstone, and the other of marl, granulated with some metallic\r\n      matter. The average breadth or interval between the two cliffs\r\n      was probably here sixty feet, but there seemed to be no\r\n      regularity of formation. Passing down, however, beyond the limit\r\n      spoken of, the interval rapidly contracted, and the sides began\r\n      to run parallel, although, for some distance farther, they were\r\n      still dissimilar in their material and form of surface. Upon\r\n      arriving within fifty feet of the bottom, a perfect regularity\r\n      commenced. The sides were now entirely uniform in substance, in\r\n      colour, and in lateral direction, the material being a very black\r\n      and shining granite, and the distance between the two sides, at\r\n      all points facing each other, exactly twenty yards. The precise\r\n      formation of the chasm will be best understood by means of a\r\n      delineation taken upon the spot; for I had luckily with me a\r\n      pocketbook and pencil, which I preserved with great care through\r\n      a long series of subsequent adventure, and to which I am indebted\r\n      for memoranda of many subjects which would otherwise have been\r\n      crowded from my remembrance.\r\n\r\n      This figure [No figures in text] gives the general outlines of\r\n      the chasm, without the minor cavities in the sides, of which\r\n      there were several, each cavity having a corresponding\r\n      protuberance opposite. The bottom of the gulf was covered to the\r\n      depth of three or four inches with a powder almost impalpable,\r\n      beneath which we found a continuation of the black granite. To\r\n      the right, at the lower extremity, will be noticed the appearance\r\n      of a small opening; this is the fissure alluded to above, and to\r\n      examine which more minutely than before was the object of our\r\n      second visit. We now pushed into it with vigor, cutting away a\r\n      quantity of brambles which impeded us, and removing a vast heap\r\n      of sharp flints somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape. We were\r\n      encouraged to persevere, however, by perceiving some little light\r\n      proceeding from the farther end. We at length squeezed our way\r\n      for about thirty feet, and found that the aperture was a low and\r\n      regularly formed arch, having a bottom of the same impalpable\r\n      powder as that in the main chasm. A strong light now broke upon\r\n      us, and, turning a short bend, we found ourselves in another\r\n      lofty chamber, similar to the one we had left in every respect\r\n      but longitudinal form. Its general figure is here given.\r\n\r\n      The total length of this chasm, commencing at the opening _a_ and\r\n      proceeding round the curve _b_ to the extremity _d_, is five\r\n      hundred and fifty yards. At _c_ we discovered a small aperture\r\n      similar to the one through which we had issued from the other\r\n      chasm, and this was choked up in the same manner with brambles\r\n      and a quantity of the white arrowhead flints. We forced our way\r\n      through it, finding it about forty feet long, and emerged into a\r\n      third chasm. This, too, was precisely like the first, except in\r\n      its longitudinal shape, which was thus.\r\n\r\n      We found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and\r\n      twenty yards. At the point _a_ was an opening about six feet\r\n      wide, and extending fifteen feet into the rock, where it\r\n      terminated in a bed of marl, there being no other chasm beyond,\r\n      as we had expected. We were about leaving this fissure, into\r\n      which very little light was admitted, when Peters called my\r\n      attention to a range of singular-looking indentures in the\r\n      surface of the marl forming the termination of the _cul-de-sac_.\r\n      With a very slight exertion of the imagination, the left, or most\r\n      northern of these indentures might have been taken for the\r\n      intentional, although rude, representation of a human figure\r\n      standing erect, with outstretched arm. The rest of them bore also\r\n      some little resemblance to alphabetical characters, and Peters\r\n      was willing, at all events, to adopt the idle opinion that they\r\n      were really such. I convinced him of his error, finally, by\r\n      directing his attention to the floor of the fissure, where, among\r\n      the powder, we picked up, piece by piece, several large flakes of\r\n      the marl, which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion\r\n      from the surface where the indentures were found, and which had\r\n      projecting points exactly fitting the indentures; thus proving\r\n      them to have been the work of nature.\r\n\r\n      After satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded\r\n      us no means of escape from our prison, we made our way back,\r\n      dejected and dispirited, to the summit of the hill. Nothing worth\r\n      mentioning occurred during the next twenty-four hours, except\r\n      that, in examining the ground to the eastward of the third chasm,\r\n      we found two triangular holes of great depth, and also with black\r\n      granite sides. Into these holes we did not think it worth while\r\n      to attempt descending, as they had the appearance of mere natural\r\n      wells, without outlet. They were each about twenty yards in\r\n      circumference, and their shape, as well as relative position in\r\n      regard to the third chasm, is shown in figure 5. {image}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 24\r\n\r\n\r\n      On the twentieth of the month, finding it altogether impossible\r\n      to subsist any longer upon the filberts, the use of which\r\n      occasioned us the most excruciating torment, we resolved to make\r\n      a desperate attempt at descending the southern declivity of the\r\n      hill. The face of the precipice was here of the softest species\r\n      of soapstone, although nearly perpendicular throughout its whole\r\n      extent (a depth of a hundred and fifty feet at the least), and in\r\n      many places even overarching. After a long search we discovered a\r\n      narrow ledge about twenty feet below the brink of the gulf; upon\r\n      this Peters contrived to leap, with what assistance I could\r\n      render him by means of our pocket-handkerchiefs tied together.\r\n      With somewhat more difficulty I also got down; and we then saw\r\n      the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in\r\n      which we had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried\r\n      by the fall of the hill—that is, by cutting steps in the face of\r\n      the soapstone with our knives. The extreme hazard of the attempt\r\n      can scarcely be conceived; but, as there was no other resource,\r\n      we determined to undertake it.\r\n\r\n      Upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbert-bushes; and\r\n      to one of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs.\r\n      The other end being tied round Peters’ waist, I lowered him down\r\n      over the edge of the precipice until the handkerchiefs were\r\n      stretched tight. He now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the\r\n      soapstone (as far in as eight or ten inches), sloping away the\r\n      rock above to the height of a foot, or thereabout, so as to allow\r\n      of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a tolerably strong peg\r\n      into the levelled surface. I then drew him up for about four\r\n      feet, when he made a hole similar to the one below, driving in a\r\n      peg as before, and having thus a resting-place for both feet and\r\n      hands. I now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush, throwing\r\n      him the end, which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole,\r\n      letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower\r\n      than he had yet been that is, to the full extent of the\r\n      handkerchiefs. Here he dug another hole, and drove another peg.\r\n      He then drew himself up, so as to rest his feet in the hole just\r\n      cut, taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above. It\r\n      was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost\r\n      peg, with the view of fastening them to the second; and here he\r\n      found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so\r\n      great a distance apart. However, after one or two unsuccessful\r\n      and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot (having to hold on\r\n      with his left hand while he labored to undo the fastening with\r\n      his right), he at length cut the string, leaving six inches of it\r\n      affixed to the peg. Tying the handkerchiefs now to the second\r\n      peg, he descended to a station below the third, taking care not\r\n      to go too far down. By these means (means which I should never\r\n      have conceived of myself, and for which we were indebted\r\n      altogether to Peters’ ingenuity and resolution) my companion\r\n      finally succeeded, with the occasional aid of projections in the\r\n      cliff, in reaching the bottom without accident.\r\n\r\n      It was some time before I could summon sufficient resolution to\r\n      follow him; but I did at length attempt it. Peters had taken off\r\n      his shirt before descending, and this, with my own, formed the\r\n      rope necessary for the adventure. After throwing down the musket\r\n      found in the chasm, I fastened this rope to the bushes, and let\r\n      myself down rapidly, striving, by the vigor of my movements, to\r\n      banish the trepidation which I could overcome in no other manner.\r\n      This answered sufficiently well for the first four or five steps;\r\n      but presently I found my imagination growing terribly excited by\r\n      thoughts of the vast depths yet to be descended, and the\r\n      precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my\r\n      only support. It was in vain I endeavored to banish these\r\n      reflections, and to keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat\r\n      surface of the cliff before me. The more earnestly I struggled\r\n      _not to think,_the more intensely vivid became my conceptions,\r\n      and the more horribly distinct. At length arrived that crisis of\r\n      fancy, so fearful in all similar cases, the crisis in which we\r\n      began to anticipate the feelings with which we _shall_fall—to\r\n      picture to ourselves the sickness, and dizziness, and the last\r\n      struggle, and the half swoon, and the final bitterness of the\r\n      rushing and headlong descent. And now I found these fancies\r\n      creating their own realities, and all imagined horrors crowding\r\n      upon me in fact. I felt my knees strike violently together, while\r\n      my fingers were gradually but certainly relaxing their grasp.\r\n      There was a ringing in my ears, and I said, “This is my knell of\r\n      death!” And now I was consumed with the irrepressible desire of\r\n      looking below. I could not, I would not, confine my glances to\r\n      the cliff; and, with a wild, indefinable emotion, half of horror,\r\n      half of a relieved oppression, I threw my vision far down into\r\n      the abyss. For one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon\r\n      their hold, while, with the movement, the faintest possible idea\r\n      of ultimate escape wandered, like a shadow, through my mind—in\r\n      the next my whole soul was pervaded with a longing to fall; a\r\n      desire, a yearning, a passion utterly uncontrollable. I let go at\r\n      once my grasp upon the peg, and, turning half round from the\r\n      precipice, remained tottering for an instant against its naked\r\n      face. But now there came a spinning of the brain; a\r\n      shrill-sounding and phantom voice screamed within my ears; a\r\n      dusky, fiendish, and filmy figure stood immediately beneath me;\r\n      and, sighing, I sunk down with a bursting heart, and plunged\r\n      within its arms.\r\n\r\n      I had swooned, and Peters had caught me as I fell. He had\r\n      observed my proceedings from his station at the bottom of the\r\n      cliff; and perceiving my imminent danger, had endeavored to\r\n      inspire me with courage by every suggestion he could devise;\r\n      although my confusion of mind had been so great as to prevent my\r\n      hearing what he said, or being conscious that he had even spoken\r\n      to me at all. At length, seeing me totter, he hastened to ascend\r\n      to my rescue, and arrived just in time for my preservation. Had I\r\n      fallen with my full weight, the rope of linen would inevitably\r\n      have snapped, and I should have been precipitated into the abyss;\r\n      as it was, he contrived to let me down gently, so as to remain\r\n      suspended without danger until animation returned. This was in\r\n      about fifteen minutes. On recovery, my trepidation had entirely\r\n      vanished; I felt a new being, and, with some little further aid\r\n      from my companion, reached the bottom also in safety.\r\n\r\n      We now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved\r\n      the tomb of our friends, and to the southward of the spot where\r\n      the hill had fallen. The place was one of singular wildness, and\r\n      its aspect brought to my mind the descriptions given by\r\n      travellers of those dreary regions marking the site of degraded\r\n      Babylon. Not to speak of the ruins of the disrupted cliff, which\r\n      formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the northward, the\r\n      surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn with\r\n      huge tumuli, apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of\r\n      art; although, in detail, no semblance of art could be detected.\r\n      Scoria were abundant, and large shapeless blocks of the black\r\n      granite, intermingled with others of marl, {*6} and both\r\n      granulated with metal. Of vegetation there were no traces\r\n      whatsoever throughout the whole of the desolate area within\r\n      sight. Several immense scorpions were seen, and various reptiles\r\n      not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes. As food was our\r\n      most immediate object, we resolved to make our way to the\r\n      seacoast, distant not more than half a mile, with a view of\r\n      catching turtle, several of which we had observed from our place\r\n      of concealment on the hill. We had proceeded some hundred yards,\r\n      threading our route cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli,\r\n      when, upon turning a corner, five savages sprung upon us from a\r\n      small cavern, felling Peters to the ground with a blow from a\r\n      club. As he fell the whole party rushed upon him to secure their\r\n      victim, leaving me time to recover from my astonishment. I still\r\n      had the musket, but the barrel had received so much injury in\r\n      being thrown from the precipice that I cast it aside as useless,\r\n      preferring to trust my pistols, which had been carefully\r\n      preserved in order. With these I advanced upon the assailants,\r\n      firing one after the other in quick succession. Two savages fell,\r\n      and one, who was in the act of thrusting a spear into Peters,\r\n      sprung to his feet without accomplishing his purpose. My\r\n      companion being thus released, we had no further difficulty. He\r\n      had his pistols also, but prudently declined using them,\r\n      confiding in his great personal strength, which far exceeded that\r\n      of any person I have ever known. Seizing a club from one of the\r\n      savages who had fallen, he dashed out the brains of the three who\r\n      remained, killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the\r\n      weapon, and leaving us completely masters of the field.\r\n\r\n      So rapidly had these events passed, that we could scarcely\r\n      believe in their reality, and were standing over the bodies of\r\n      the dead in a species of stupid contemplation, when we were\r\n      brought to recollection by the sound of shouts in the distance.\r\n      It was clear that the savages had been alarmed by the firing, and\r\n      that we had little chance of avoiding discovery. To regain the\r\n      cliff, it would be necessary to proceed in the direction of the\r\n      shouts, and even should we succeed in arriving at its base, we\r\n      should never be able to ascend it without being seen. Our\r\n      situation was one of the greatest peril, and we were hesitating\r\n      in which path to commence a flight, when one of the savages\r\n      _whom_I had shot, and supposed dead, sprang briskly to his feet,\r\n      and attempted to make his escape. We overtook _him,_however,\r\n      before he had advanced many paces, and were about to put him to\r\n      death, when Peters suggested that we might derive some benefit\r\n      from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt to escape. We\r\n      therefore dragged him with us, making him understand that we\r\n      would shoot him if he offered resistance. In a few minutes he was\r\n      perfectly submissive, and ran by our sides as we pushed in among\r\n      the rocks, making for the seashore.\r\n\r\n      So far, the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing\r\n      hid the sea, except at intervals, from our sight, and, when we\r\n      first had it fairly in view, it was perhaps two hundred yards\r\n      distant. As we emerged into the open beach we saw, to our great\r\n      dismay, an immense crowd of the natives pouring from the village,\r\n      and from all visible quarters of the island, making toward us\r\n      with gesticulations of extreme fury, and howling like wild\r\n      beasts. We were upon the point of turning upon our steps, and\r\n      trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the rougher\r\n      ground, when I discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from\r\n      behind a large rock which ran out into the water. Toward these we\r\n      now ran with all speed, and, reaching them, found them unguarded,\r\n      and without any other freight than three of the large Gallipago\r\n      turtles and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers. We\r\n      instantly took possession of one of them, and, forcing our\r\n      captive on board, pushed out to sea with all the strength we\r\n      could command.\r\n\r\n      We had not made, however, more than fifty yards from the shore\r\n      before we became sufficiently calm to perceive the great\r\n      oversight of which we had been guilty in leaving the other canoe\r\n      in the power of the savages, who, by this time, were not more\r\n      than twice as far from the beach as ourselves, and were rapidly\r\n      advancing to the pursuit. No time was now to be lost. Our hope\r\n      was, at best, a forlorn one, but we had none other. It was very\r\n      doubtful whether, with the utmost exertion, we could get back in\r\n      time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe; but\r\n      yet there was a chance that we could. We might save ourselves if\r\n      we succeeded, while not to make the attempt was to resign\r\n      ourselves to inevitable butchery.\r\n\r\n      The canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike, and, in\r\n      place of turning it around, we merely changed our position in\r\n      paddling. As soon as the savages perceived this they redoubled\r\n      their yells, as well as their speed, and approached with\r\n      inconceivable rapidity. We pulled, however, with all the energy\r\n      of desperation, and arrived at the contested point before more\r\n      than one of the natives had attained it. This man paid dearly for\r\n      his superior agility, Peters shooting him through the head with a\r\n      pistol as he approached the shore. The foremost among the rest of\r\n      his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces distant as we\r\n      seized upon the canoe. We at first endeavored to pull her into\r\n      the deep water, beyond the reach of the savages, but, finding her\r\n      too firmly aground, and there being no time to spare, Peters,\r\n      with one or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket,\r\n      succeeded in dashing out a large portion of the bow and of one\r\n      side. We then pushed off. Two of the natives by this time had got\r\n      hold of our boat, obstinately refusing to let go, until we were\r\n      forced to despatch them with our knives. We were now clear off,\r\n      and making great way out to sea. The main body of the savages,\r\n      upon reaching the broken canoe, set up the most tremendous yell\r\n      of rage and disappointment conceivable. In truth, from everything\r\n      I could see of these wretches, they appeared to be the most\r\n      wicked, hypocritical, vindictive, bloodthirsty, and altogether\r\n      fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe. It is clear we\r\n      should have had no mercy had we fallen into their hands. They\r\n      made a mad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe, but,\r\n      finding it useless, again vented their rage in a series of\r\n      hideous vociferations, and rushed up into the hills.\r\n\r\n      We were thus relieved from immediate danger, but our situation\r\n      was still sufficiently gloomy. We knew that four canoes of the\r\n      kind we had were at one time in the possession of the savages,\r\n      and were not aware of the fact (afterward ascertained from our\r\n      captive) that two of these had been blown to pieces in the\r\n      explosion of the _Jane Guy._We calculated, therefore, upon being\r\n      yet pursued, as soon as our enemies could get round to the bay\r\n      (distant about three miles) where the boats were usually laid up.\r\n      Fearing this, we made every exertion to leave the island behind\r\n      us, and went rapidly through the water, forcing the prisoner to\r\n      take a paddle. In about half an hour, when we had gained probably\r\n      five or six miles to the southward, a large fleet of the\r\n      flat-bottomed canoes or rafts were seen to emerge from the bay\r\n      evidently with the design of pursuit. Presently they put back,\r\n      despairing to overtake us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 25\r\n\r\n\r\n      We now found ourselves in the wide and desolate Antarctic Ocean,\r\n      in a latitude exceeding eighty-four degrees, in a frail canoe,\r\n      and with no provision but the three turtles. The long polar\r\n      winter, too, could not be considered as far distant, and it\r\n      became necessary that we should deliberate well upon the course\r\n      to be pursued. There were six or seven islands in sight belonging\r\n      to the same group, and distant from each other about five or six\r\n      leagues; but upon neither of these had we any intention to\r\n      venture. In coming from the northward in the _Jane Guy_ we had\r\n      been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of\r\n      ice—this, however little it maybe in accordance with the\r\n      generally received notions respecting the Antarctic, was a\r\n      fact—experience would not permit us to deny. To attempt,\r\n      therefore, getting back would be folly—especially at so late a\r\n      period of the season. Only one course seemed to be left open for\r\n      hope. We resolved to steer boldly to the southward, where there\r\n      was at least a probability of discovering other lands, and more\r\n      than a probability of finding a still milder climate.\r\n\r\n      So far we had found the Antarctic, like the Arctic Ocean,\r\n      peculiarly free from violent storms or immoderately rough water;\r\n      but our canoe was, at best, of frail structure, although large,\r\n      and we set busily to work with a view of rendering her as safe as\r\n      the limited means in our possession would admit. The body of the\r\n      boat was of no better material than bark—the bark of a tree\r\n      unknown. The ribs were of a tough osier, well adapted to the\r\n      purpose for which it was used. We had fifty feet room from stem\r\n      to stern, from four to six in breadth, and in depth throughout\r\n      four feet and a half-the boats thus differing vastly in shape\r\n      from those of any other inhabitants of the Southern Ocean with\r\n      whom civilized nations are acquainted. We never did believe them\r\n      the workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them; and\r\n      some days after this period discovered, by questioning our\r\n      captive, that they were in fact made by the natives of a group to\r\n      the southwest of the country where we found them, having fallen\r\n      accidentally into the hands of our barbarians. What we could do\r\n      for the security of our boat was very little indeed. Several wide\r\n      rents were discovered near both ends, and these we contrived to\r\n      patch up with pieces of woollen jacket. With the help of the\r\n      superfluous paddles, of which there were a great many, we erected\r\n      a kind of framework about the bow, so as to break the force of\r\n      any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter. We also\r\n      set up two paddle-blades for masts, placing them opposite each\r\n      other, one by each gunwale, thus saving the necessity of a yard.\r\n      To these masts we attached a sail made of our shirts-doing this\r\n      with some difficulty, as here we could get no assistance from our\r\n      prisoner whatever, although he had been willing enough to labor\r\n      in all the other operations. The sight of the linen seemed to\r\n      affect him in a very singular manner. He could not be prevailed\r\n      upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to\r\n      force him, and shrieking out, _“Tekeli-li!”_\r\n\r\n      Having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of\r\n      the canoe, we now set sail to the south-southeast for the\r\n      present, with the view of weathering the most southerly of the\r\n      group in sight. This being done, we turned the bow full to the\r\n      southward. The weather could by no means be considered\r\n      disagreeable. We had a prevailing and very gentle wind from the\r\n      northward, a smooth sea, and continual daylight. No ice whatever\r\n      was to be seen; _nor did I ever see one particle of this after\r\n      leaving the parallel of Bennet’s Islet._Indeed, the temperature\r\n      of the water was here far too warm for its existence in any\r\n      quantity. Having killed the largest of our tortoises, and\r\n      obtained from him not only food but a copious supply of water, we\r\n      continued on our course, without any incident of moment, for\r\n      perhaps seven or eight days, during which period we must have\r\n      proceeded a vast distance to the southward, as the wind blew\r\n      constantly with us, and a very strong current set continually in\r\n      the direction we were pursuing.\r\n\r\n      _March 1st_. {*7}-Many unusual phenomena now—indicated that we\r\n      were entering upon a region of novelty and wonder. A high range\r\n      of light gray vapor appeared constantly in the southern horizon,\r\n      flaring up occasionally in lofty streaks, now darting from east\r\n      to west, now from west to east, and again presenting a level and\r\n      uniform summit—in short, having all the wild variations of the\r\n      Aurora Borealis. The average height of this vapor, as apparent\r\n      from our station, was about twenty-five degrees. The temperature\r\n      of the sea seemed to be increasing momentarily, and there was a\r\n      very perceptible alteration in its color.\r\n\r\n      _March 2d._-To-day by repeated questioning of our captive, we\r\n      came to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island\r\n      of the massacre, its inhabitants, and customs—but with these how\r\n      can I now detain the reader? I may say, however, that we learned\r\n      there were eight islands in the group—that they were governed by\r\n      a common king, named _Tsalemon_or _Psalemoun,_who resided in one\r\n      of the smallest of the islands; that the black skins forming the\r\n      dress of the warriors came from an animal of huge size to be\r\n      found only in a valley near the court of the king—that the\r\n      inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats than the\r\n      flat-bottomed rafts; the four canoes being all of the kind in\r\n      their possession, and, these having been obtained, by mere\r\n      accident, from some large island in the southwest—that his own\r\n      name was Nu-Nu—that he had no knowledge of Bennet’s Islet—and\r\n      that the appellation of the island he had left was Tsalal. The\r\n      commencement of the words _Tsalemon_and Tsalal was given with a\r\n      prolonged hissing sound, which we found it impossible to imitate,\r\n      even after repeated endeavors, and which was precisely the same\r\n      with the note of the black bittern we had eaten up on the summit\r\n      of the hill.\r\n\r\n      _March 3d._-The heat of the water was now truly remarkable, and\r\n      in color was undergoing a rapid change, being no longer\r\n      transparent, but of a milky consistency and hue. In our immediate\r\n      vicinity it was usually smooth, never so rough as to endanger the\r\n      canoe—but we were frequently surprised at perceiving, to our\r\n      right and left, at different distances, sudden and extensive\r\n      agitations of the surface; these, we at length noticed, were\r\n      always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapor to the\r\n      southward.\r\n\r\n      _March 4th._-To-day, with the view of widening our sail, the\r\n      breeze from the northward dying away perceptibly, I took from my\r\n      coat-pocket a white handkerchief. Nu-Nu was seated at my elbow,\r\n      and the linen accidentally flaring in his face, he became\r\n      violently affected with convulsions. These were succeeded by\r\n      drowsiness and stupor, and low murmurings of _“‘Tekeli-li!\r\n      Tekeli-li!”_\r\n\r\n      _March_5th.-The wind had entirely ceased, but it was evident that\r\n      we were still hurrying on to the southward, under the influence\r\n      of a powerful current. And now,—indeed, it would seem reasonable\r\n      that we should experience some alarm at the turn events were\r\n      taking—but we felt none. The countenance of Peters indicated\r\n      nothing of this nature, although it wore at times an expression I\r\n      could not fathom. The polar winter appeared to be coming on—but\r\n      coming without its terrors. I felt a numbness of body and mind—a\r\n      dreaminess of sensation but this was all.\r\n\r\n      _March 6th._-The gray vapor had now arisen many more degrees\r\n      above the horizon, and was gradually losing its grayness of tint.\r\n      The heat of the water was extreme, even unpleasant to the touch,\r\n      and its milky hue was more evident than ever. Today a violent\r\n      agitation of the water occurred very close to the canoe. It was\r\n      attended, as usual, with a wild flaring up of the vapor at its\r\n      summit, and a momentary division at its base. A fine white\r\n      powder, resembling ashes—but certainly not such—fell over the\r\n      canoe and over a large surface of the water, as the flickering\r\n      died away among the vapor and the commotion subsided in the sea.\r\n      Nu-Nu now threw himself on his face in the bottom of the boat,\r\n      and no persuasions could induce him to arise.\r\n\r\n      _March 7th._-This day we questioned Nu-Nu concerning the motives\r\n      of his countrymen in destroying our companions; but he appeared\r\n      to be too utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational\r\n      reply. He still obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat; and,\r\n      upon reiterating the questions as to the motive, made use only of\r\n      idiotic gesticulations, such as raising with his forefinger the\r\n      upper lip, and displaying the teeth which lay beneath it. These\r\n      were black. We had never before seen the teeth of an inhabitant\r\n      of Tsalal.\r\n\r\n      _March 8th._-To-day there floated by us one of the white animals\r\n      whose appearance upon the beach at Tsalal had occasioned so wild\r\n      a commotion among the savages. I would have picked it up, but\r\n      there came over me a sudden listlessness, and I forbore. The heat\r\n      of the water still increased, and the hand could no longer be\r\n      endured within it. Peters spoke little, and I knew not what to\r\n      think of his apathy. Nu-Nu breathed, and no more.\r\n\r\n      _March 9th._-The whole ashy material fell now continually around\r\n      us, and in vast quantities. The range of vapor to the southward\r\n      had arisen prodigiously in the horizon, and began to assume more\r\n      distinctness of form. I can liken it to nothing but a limitless\r\n      cataract, rolling silently into the sea from some immense and\r\n      far-distant rampart in the heaven. The gigantic curtain ranged\r\n      along the whole extent of the southern horizon. It emitted no\r\n      sound.\r\n\r\n      _March 21st._-A sullen darkness now hovered above us—but from out\r\n      the milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose, and stole\r\n      up along the bulwarks of the boat. We were nearly overwhelmed by\r\n      the white ashy shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe,\r\n      but melted into the water as it fell. The summit of the cataract\r\n      was utterly lost in the dimness and the distance. Yet we were\r\n      evidently approaching it with a hideous velocity. At intervals\r\n      there were visible in it wide, yawning, but momentary rents, and\r\n      from out these rents, within which was a chaos of flitting and\r\n      indistinct images, there came rushing and mighty, but soundless\r\n      winds, tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course.\r\n\r\n      _March 22d._-The darkness had materially increased, relieved only\r\n      by the glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain\r\n      before us. Many gigantic and pallidly white birds flew\r\n      continuously now from beyond the veil, and their scream was the\r\n      eternal _Tekeli-li!_as they retreated from our vision. Hereupon\r\n      Nu-Nu stirred in the bottom of the boat; but upon touching him we\r\n      found his spirit departed. And now we rushed into the embraces of\r\n      the cataract, where a chasm threw itself open to receive us. But\r\n      there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure, very far\r\n      larger in its proportions than any dweller among men. And the hue\r\n      of the skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the\r\n      snow.\r\n\r\n      NOTE\r\n\r\n      THE circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing\r\n      death of Mr. Pym are already well known to the public through the\r\n      medium of the daily press. It is feared that the few remaining\r\n      chapters which were to have completed his narrative, and which\r\n      were retained by him, while the above were in type, for the\r\n      purpose of revision, have been irrecoverably lost through the\r\n      accident by which he perished himself. This, however, may prove\r\n      not to be the case, and the papers, if ultimately found, will be\r\n      given to the public.\r\n\r\n      No means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency. The\r\n      gentleman whose name is mentioned in the preface, and who, from\r\n      the statement there made, might be supposed able to fill the\r\n      vacuum, has declined the task—this, for satisfactory reasons\r\n      connected with the general inaccuracy of the details afforded\r\n      him, and his disbelief in the entire truth of the latter portions\r\n      of the narration. Peters, from whom some information might be\r\n      expected, is still alive, and a resident of Illinois, but cannot\r\n      be met with at present. He may hereafter be found, and will, no\r\n      doubt, afford material for a conclusion of Mr. Pym’s account.\r\n\r\n      The loss of two or three final chapters (for there were but two\r\n      or three) is the more deeply to be regretted, as it can not be\r\n      doubted they contained matter relative to the Pole itself, or at\r\n      least to regions in its very near proximity; and as, too, the\r\n      statements of the author in relation to these regions may shortly\r\n      be verified or contradicted by means of the governmental\r\n      expedition now preparing for the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\n      On one point in the narrative some remarks may well be offered;\r\n      and it would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if\r\n      what he may here observe should have a tendency to throw credit,\r\n      in any degree, upon the very singular pages now published. We\r\n      allude to the chasms found in the island of Tsalal, and to the\r\n      whole of the figures upon pages 245-47 {of the printed\r\n      edition—ed.}.\r\n\r\n      (Note: No figures were included with this text)\r\n\r\n      Mr. Pym has given the figures of the chasms without comment, and\r\n      speaks decidedly of the _indentures_found at the extremity of the\r\n      most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful\r\n      resemblance to alphabetical characters, and, in short, as being\r\n      positively _not such. _This assertion is made in a manner so\r\n      simple, and sustained by a species of demonstration so conclusive\r\n      (viz., the fitting of the projections of the fragments found\r\n      among the dust into the indentures upon the wall), that we are\r\n      forced to believe the writer in earnest; and no reasonable reader\r\n      should suppose otherwise. But as the facts in relation to all the\r\n      figures are most singular (especially when taken in connection\r\n      with statements made in the body of the narrative), it may be as\r\n      well to say a word or two concerning them all—this, too, the more\r\n      especially as the facts in question have, beyond doubt, escaped\r\n      the attention of Mr. Poe.\r\n\r\n      Figure 1, then, figure 2, figure 3, and figure 5, when conjoined\r\n      with one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves\r\n      presented, and when deprived of the small lateral branches or\r\n      arches (which, it will be remembered, served only as a means of\r\n      communication between the main chambers, and were of totally\r\n      distinct character), constitute an Ethiopian verbal root—the root\r\n      “To be shady,’—whence all the inflections of shadow or darkness.\r\n\r\n      In regard to the “left or most northwardly” of the indentures in\r\n      figure 4, it is more than probable that the opinion of Peters was\r\n      correct, and that the hieroglyphical appearance was really the\r\n      work of art, and intended as the representation of a human form.\r\n      The delineation is before the reader, and he may, or may not,\r\n      perceive the resemblance suggested; but the rest of the\r\n      indentures afford strong confirmation of Peters’ idea. The upper\r\n      range is evidently the Arabic verbal root “To be white,” whence\r\n      all the inflections of brilliancy and whiteness. The lower range\r\n      is not so immediately perspicuous. The characters are somewhat\r\n      broken and disjointed; nevertheless, it can not be doubted that,\r\n      in their perfect state, they formed the full Egyptian word, “The\r\n      region of the south.” It should be observed that these\r\n      interpretations confirm the opinion of Peters in regard to the\r\n      “most northwardly” of the figures. The arm is outstretched toward\r\n      the south.\r\n\r\n      Conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and\r\n      exciting conjecture. They should be regarded, perhaps, in\r\n      connection with some of the most faintly detailed incidents of\r\n      the narrative; although in no visible manner is this chain of\r\n      connection complete. Tekeli-li! was the cry of the affrighted\r\n      natives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcase of the\r\n      _white_animal picked up at sea. This also was the shuddering\r\n      exclamatives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the\r\n      _white_materials in possession of Mr. Pym. This also was the\r\n      shriek of the swift-flying, _white, _and gigantic birds which\r\n      issued from the vapory _white_curtain of the South. Nothing\r\n      _white_was to be found at Tsalal, and nothing otherwise in the\r\n      subsequent voyage to the region beyond. It is not impossible that\r\n      “Tsalal,” the appellation of the island of the chasms, may be\r\n      found, upon minute philological scrutiny, to betray either some\r\n      alliance with the chasms themselves, or some reference to the\r\n      Ethiopian characters so mysteriously written in their windings.\r\n\r\n      _“I have graven it within the hills, and my vengeance upon the\r\n      dust within the rock.”_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO THE THIRD VOLUME\r\n\r\n\r\n      {*1} Whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron oil-tanks—why\r\n      the _Grampus_ was not I have never been able to ascertain.\r\n\r\n      {*2} The case of the brig _Polly_, of Boston, is one so much in\r\n      point, and her fate, in many respects, so remarkably similar to\r\n      our own, that I cannot forbear alluding to it here. This vessel,\r\n      of one hundred and thirty tons burden, sailed from Boston, with a\r\n      cargo of lumber and provisions, for Santa Croix, on the twelfth\r\n      of December, 1811, under the command of Captain Casneau. There\r\n      were eight souls on board besides the captain—the mate, four\r\n      seamen, and the cook, together with a Mr. Hunt, and a negro girl\r\n      belonging to him. On the fifteenth, having cleared the shoal of\r\n      Georges, she sprung a leak in a gale of wind from the southeast,\r\n      and was finally capsized; but, the masts going by the board, she\r\n      afterward righted. They remained in this situation, without fire,\r\n      and with very little provision, for the period of one hundred and\r\n      ninety-one days (from December the fifteenth to June the\r\n      twentieth), when Captain Casneau and Samuel Badger, the only\r\n      survivors, were taken off the wreck by the Fame, of Hull, Captain\r\n      Featherstone, bound home from Rio Janeiro. When picked up, they\r\n      were in latitude 28 degrees N., longitude 13 degrees W., having\r\n      drifted above two thousand miles! On the ninth of July the Fame\r\n      fell in with the brig Dromero, Captain Perkins, who landed the\r\n      two sufferers in Kennebeck. The narrative from which we gather\r\n      these details ends in the following words:\r\n\r\n      “It is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast\r\n      distance, upon the most frequented part of the Atlantic, and not\r\n      be discovered all this time. They were passed by more than a\r\n      dozen sail, one of which came so nigh them that they could\r\n      distinctly see the people on deck and on the rigging looking at\r\n      them; but, to the inexpressible disappointment of the starving\r\n      and freezing men, they stifled the dictates of compassion,\r\n      hoisted sail, and cruelly abandoned them to their fate.”\r\n\r\n      {*3} Among the vessels which at various times have professed to\r\n      meet with the Auroras may be mentioned the ship San Miguel, in\r\n      1769; the ship Aurora, in 1774; the brig Pearl, in 1779; and the\r\n      ship Dolores, in 1790. They all agree in giving the mean latitude\r\n      fifty-three degrees south.\r\n\r\n      {*4} The terms morning and evening, which I have made use of to\r\n      avoid confusion in my narrative, as far as possible, must not, of\r\n      course, be taken in their ordinary sense. For a long time past we\r\n      had had no night at all, the daylight being continual. The dates\r\n      throughout are according to nautical time, and the bearing must\r\n      be understood as per compass. I would also remark, in this place,\r\n      that I cannot, in the first portion of what is here written,\r\n      pretend to strict accuracy in respect to dates, or latitudes and\r\n      longitudes, having kept no regular journal until after the period\r\n      of which this first portion treats. In many instances I have\r\n      relied altogether upon memory.\r\n\r\n      {*5} This day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the\r\n      south several huge wreaths of the grayish vapour I have spoken\r\n      of.\r\n\r\n      {*6} The marl was also black; indeed, we noticed no light colored\r\n      substances of any kind upon the island.\r\n\r\n      {*7}For obvious reasons I cannot pretend to strict accuracy in\r\n      these dates. They are given principally with a view to perspicity\r\n      of narrative, and as set down in my pencil memorandum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGEIA\r\n\r\n\r\n      And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the\r\n      mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God is but a great\r\n      will pervading all things by nature of its intentness. Man doth\r\n      not yield himself to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save\r\n      only through the weakness of his feeble will.—_Joseph Glanvill_.\r\n\r\n      I cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely\r\n      where, I first became acquainted with the lady Ligeia. Long years\r\n      have since elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much\r\n      suffering. Or, perhaps, I cannot now bring these points to mind,\r\n      because, in truth, the character of my beloved, her rare\r\n      learning, her singular yet placid cast of beauty, and the\r\n      thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language,\r\n      made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily\r\n      progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown. Yet I\r\n      believe that I met her first and most frequently in some large,\r\n      old, decaying city near the Rhine. Of her family—I have surely\r\n      heard her speak. That it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be\r\n      doubted. Ligeia! Ligeia! Buried in studies of a nature more than\r\n      all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world, it\r\n      is by that sweet word alone—by Ligeia—that I bring before mine\r\n      eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more. And now, while I\r\n      write, a recollection flashes upon me that I have never known the\r\n      paternal name of her who was my friend and my betrothed, and who\r\n      became the partner of my studies, and finally the wife of my\r\n      bosom. Was it a playful charge on the part of my Ligeia? or was\r\n      it a test of my strength of affection, that I should institute no\r\n      inquiries upon this point? or was it rather a caprice of my own—a\r\n      wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate\r\n      devotion? I but indistinctly recall the fact itself—what wonder\r\n      that I have utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated\r\n      or attended it? And, indeed, if ever that spirit which is\r\n      entitled _Romance_—if ever she, the wan and the misty-winged\r\n      _Ashtophet_ of idolatrous Egypt, presided, as they tell, over\r\n      marriages ill-omened, then most surely she presided over mine.\r\n\r\n      There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me\r\n      not. It is the person of Ligeia. In stature she was tall,\r\n      somewhat slender, and, in her latter days, even emaciated. I\r\n      would in vain attempt to portray the majesty, the quiet ease, of\r\n      her demeanor, or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of\r\n      her footfall. She came and departed as a shadow. I was never made\r\n      aware of her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music\r\n      of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand upon my\r\n      shoulder. In beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her. It was\r\n      the radiance of an opium-dream—an airy and spirit-lifting vision\r\n      more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered about the\r\n      slumbering souls of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were\r\n      not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to\r\n      worship in the classical labors of the heathen. “There is no\r\n      exquisite beauty,” says Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of\r\n      all the forms and genera of beauty, “without some strangeness in\r\n      the proportion.” Yet, although I saw that the features of Ligeia\r\n      were not of a classic regularity—although I perceived that her\r\n      loveliness was indeed “exquisite,” and felt that there was much\r\n      of “strangeness” pervading it, yet I have tried in vain to detect\r\n      the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of “the\r\n      strange.” I examined the contour of the lofty and pale\r\n      forehead—it was faultless—how cold indeed that word when applied\r\n      to a majesty so divine!—the skin rivalling the purest ivory, the\r\n      commanding extent and repose, the gentle prominence of the\r\n      regions above the temples; and then the raven-black, the glossy,\r\n      the luxuriant and naturally-curling tresses, setting forth the\r\n      full force of the Homeric epithet, “hyacinthine!” I looked at the\r\n      delicate outlines of the nose—and nowhere but in the graceful\r\n      medallions of the Hebrews had I beheld a similar perfection.\r\n      There were the same luxurious smoothness of surface, the same\r\n      scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the same\r\n      harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit. I regarded\r\n      the sweet mouth. Here was indeed the triumph of all things\r\n      heavenly—the magnificent turn of the short upper lip—the soft,\r\n      voluptuous slumber of the under—the dimples which sported, and\r\n      the color which spoke—the teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy\r\n      almost startling, every ray of the holy light which fell upon\r\n      them in her serene and placid, yet most exultingly radiant of all\r\n      smiles. I scrutinized the formation of the chin—and here, too, I\r\n      found the gentleness of breadth, the softness and the majesty,\r\n      the fullness and the spirituality, of the Greek—the contour which\r\n      the god Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the son of\r\n      the Athenian. And then I peered into the large eyes of Ligeia.\r\n\r\n      For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might have\r\n      been, too, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to\r\n      which Lord Verulam alludes. They were, I must believe, far larger\r\n      than the ordinary eyes of our own race. They were even fuller\r\n      than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley\r\n      of Nourjahad. Yet it was only at intervals—in moments of intense\r\n      excitement—that this peculiarity became more than slightly\r\n      noticeable in Ligeia. And at such moments was her beauty—in my\r\n      heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps—the beauty of beings either\r\n      above or apart from the earth—the beauty of the fabulous Houri of\r\n      the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black,\r\n      and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows,\r\n      slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The\r\n      “strangeness,” however, which I found in the eyes, was of a\r\n      nature distinct from the formation, or the color, or the\r\n      brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred to\r\n      the expression. Ah, word of no meaning! behind whose vast\r\n      latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of\r\n      the spiritual. The expression of the eyes of Ligeia! How for long\r\n      hours have I pondered upon it! How have I, through the whole of a\r\n      midsummer night, struggled to fathom it! What was it—that\r\n      something more profound than the well of Democritus—which lay far\r\n      within the pupils of my beloved? What was it? I was possessed\r\n      with a passion to discover. Those eyes! those large, those\r\n      shining, those divine orbs! they became to me twin stars of Leda,\r\n      and I to them devoutest of astrologers.\r\n\r\n      There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of\r\n      the science of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the\r\n      fact—never, I believe, noticed in the schools—that, in our\r\n      endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten, we often\r\n      find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance, without being\r\n      able, in the end, to remember. And thus how frequently, in my\r\n      intense scrutiny of Ligeia’s eyes, have I felt approaching the\r\n      full knowledge of their expression—felt it approaching—yet not\r\n      quite be mine—and so at length entirely depart! And (strange, oh\r\n      strangest mystery of all!) I found, in the commonest objects of\r\n      the universe, a circle of analogies to that expression. I mean to\r\n      say that, subsequently to the period when Ligeia’s beauty passed\r\n      into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from\r\n      many existences in the material world, a sentiment such as I felt\r\n      always aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs. Yet not\r\n      the more could I define that sentiment, or analyze, or even\r\n      steadily view it. I recognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in\r\n      the survey of a rapidly-growing vine—in the contemplation of a\r\n      moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a stream of running water. I have\r\n      felt it in the ocean—in the falling of a meteor. I have felt it\r\n      in the glances of unusually aged people. And there are one or two\r\n      stars in heaven—(one especially, a star of the sixth magnitude,\r\n      double and changeable, to be found near the large star in Lyra)\r\n      in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made aware of the\r\n      feeling. I have been filled with it by certain sounds from\r\n      stringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passages from\r\n      books. Among innumerable other instances, I well remember\r\n      something in a volume of Joseph Glanvill, which (perhaps merely\r\n      from its quaintness—who shall say?) never failed to inspire me\r\n      with the sentiment: “And the will therein lieth, which dieth not.\r\n      Who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God is\r\n      but a great will pervading all things by nature of its\r\n      intentness. Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death\r\n      utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.”\r\n\r\n      Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to\r\n      trace, indeed, some remote connection between this passage in the\r\n      English moralist and a portion of the character of Ligeia. An\r\n      intensity in thought, action, or speech, was possibly, in her, a\r\n      result, or at least an index, of that gigantic volition which,\r\n      during our long intercourse, failed to give other and more\r\n      immediate evidence of its existence. Of all the women whom I have\r\n      ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid Ligeia, was\r\n      the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern\r\n      passion. And of such passion I could form no estimate, save by\r\n      the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted\r\n      and appalled me—by the almost magical melody, modulation,\r\n      distinctness and placidity of her very low voice—and by the\r\n      fierce energy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her\r\n      manner of utterance) of the wild words which she habitually\r\n      uttered.\r\n\r\n      I have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was immense—such as I\r\n      have never known in woman. In the classical tongues was she\r\n      deeply proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in\r\n      regard to the modern dialects of Europe, I have never known her\r\n      at fault. Indeed upon any theme of the most admired, because\r\n      simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy,\r\n      have I ever found Ligeia at fault? How singularly—how\r\n      thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife has forced\r\n      itself, at this late period only, upon my attention! I said her\r\n      knowledge was such as I have never known in woman—but where\r\n      breathes the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the\r\n      wide areas of moral, physical, and mathematical science? I saw\r\n      not then what I now clearly perceive, that the acquisitions of\r\n      Ligeia were gigantic, were astounding; yet I was sufficiently\r\n      aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself, with a\r\n      child-like confidence, to her guidance through the chaotic world\r\n      of metaphysical investigation at which I was most busily occupied\r\n      during the earlier years of our marriage. With how vast a\r\n      triumph—with how vivid a delight—with how much of all that is\r\n      ethereal in hope did I feel, as she bent over me in studies but\r\n      little sought—but less known—that delicious vista by slow degrees\r\n      expanding before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden\r\n      path, I might at length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too\r\n      divinely precious not to be forbidden!\r\n\r\n      How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after\r\n      some years, I beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to\r\n      themselves and fly away! Without Ligeia I was but as a child\r\n      groping benighted. Her presence, her readings alone, rendered\r\n      vividly luminous the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in\r\n      which we were immersed. Wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes,\r\n      letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than Saturnian lead. And\r\n      now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over\r\n      which I pored. Ligeia grew ill. The wild eyes blazed with a\r\n      too—too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the\r\n      transparent waxen hue of the grave; and the blue veins upon the\r\n      lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the\r\n      gentle emotion. I saw that she must die—and I struggled\r\n      desperately in spirit with the grim Azrael. And the struggles of\r\n      the passionate wife were, to my astonishment, even more energetic\r\n      than my own. There had been much in her stern nature to impress\r\n      me with the belief that, to her, death would have come without\r\n      its terrors; but not so. Words are impotent to convey any just\r\n      idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with\r\n      the Shadow. I groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle. I\r\n      would have soothed—I would have reasoned; but, in the intensity\r\n      of her wild desire for life,—for life—but for life—solace and\r\n      reason were the uttermost folly. Yet not until the last instance,\r\n      amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was\r\n      shaken the external placidity of her demeanor. Her voice grew\r\n      more gentle—grew more low—yet I would not wish to dwell upon the\r\n      wild meaning of the quietly uttered words. My brain reeled as I\r\n      hearkened, entranced, to a melody more than mortal—to assumptions\r\n      and aspirations which mortality had never before known.\r\n\r\n      That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might have\r\n      been easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have\r\n      reigned no ordinary passion. But in death only, was I fully\r\n      impressed with the strength of her affection. For long hours,\r\n      detaining my hand, would she pour out before me the overflowing\r\n      of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to\r\n      idolatry. How had I deserved to be so blessed by such\r\n      confessions?—how had I deserved to be so cursed with the removal\r\n      of my beloved in the hour of her making them? But upon this\r\n      subject I cannot bear to dilate. Let me say only, that in\r\n      Ligeia’s more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all\r\n      unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length recognized the\r\n      principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a desire for the\r\n      life which was now fleeing so rapidly away. It is this wild\r\n      longing—it is this eager vehemence of desire for life—but for\r\n      life—that I have no power to portray—no utterance capable of\r\n      expressing.\r\n\r\n      At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me,\r\n      peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses\r\n      composed by herself not many days before. I obeyed her. They were\r\n      these:\r\n\r\nLo! ’tis a gala night\r\n    Within the lonesome latter years!\r\nAn angel throng, bewinged, bedight\r\n    In veils, and drowned in tears,\r\nSit in a theatre, to see\r\n    A play of hopes and fears,\r\nWhile the orchestra breathes fitfully\r\n    The music of the spheres.\r\n\r\nMimes, in the form of God on high,\r\n    Mutter and mumble low,\r\nAnd hither and thither fly;\r\n    Mere puppets they, who come and go\r\nAt bidding of vast formless things\r\n    That shift the scenery to and fro,\r\nFlapping from out their Condor wings\r\n    Invisible Wo!\r\n\r\nThat motley drama!—oh, be sure\r\n    It shall not be forgot!\r\nWith its Phantom chased forever more,\r\n    By a crowd that seize it not,\r\nThrough a circle that ever returneth in\r\n    To the self-same spot,\r\nAnd much of Madness and more of Sin\r\n    And Horror the soul of the plot.\r\n\r\nBut see, amid the mimic rout,\r\n    A crawling shape intrude!\r\nA blood-red thing that writhes from out\r\n    The scenic solitude!\r\nIt writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs\r\n    The mimes become its food,\r\nAnd the seraphs sob at vermin fangs\r\n    In human gore imbued.\r\n\r\nOut—out are the lights—out all!\r\n    And over each quivering form,\r\nThe curtain, a funeral pall,\r\n    Comes down with the rush of a storm,\r\nAnd the angels, all pallid and wan,\r\n    Uprising, unveiling, affirm\r\nThat the play is the tragedy, “Man,”\r\n    And its hero the Conqueror Worm.\r\n\r\n      “O God!” half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending\r\n      her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of\r\n      these lines—“O God! O Divine Father!—shall these things be\r\n      undeviatingly so?—shall this Conqueror be not once conquered? Are\r\n      we not part and parcel in Thee? Who—who knoweth the mysteries of\r\n      the will with its vigor? Man doth not yield him to the angels,\r\n      nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his\r\n      feeble will.”\r\n\r\n      And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white\r\n      arms to fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as\r\n      she breathed her last sighs, there came mingled with them a low\r\n      murmur from her lips. I bent to them my ear and distinguished,\r\n      again, the concluding words of the passage in Glanvill—“Man doth\r\n      not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only\r\n      through the weakness of his feeble will.”\r\n\r\n      She died: and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no\r\n      longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and\r\n      decaying city by the Rhine. I had no lack of what the world calls\r\n      wealth. Ligeia had brought me far more, very far more than\r\n      ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals. After a few months,\r\n      therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, I purchased, and put\r\n      in some repair, an abbey, which I shall not name, in one of the\r\n      wildest and least frequented portions of fair England. The gloomy\r\n      and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost savage aspect of\r\n      the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored memories\r\n      connected with both, had much in unison with the feelings of\r\n      utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and\r\n      unsocial region of the country. Yet although the external abbey,\r\n      with its verdant decay hanging about it, suffered but little\r\n      alteration, I gave way, with a child-like perversity, and\r\n      perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to a\r\n      display of more than regal magnificence within. For such follies,\r\n      even in childhood, I had imbibed a taste and now they came back\r\n      to me as if in the dotage of grief. Alas, I feel how much even of\r\n      incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and\r\n      fantastic draperies, in the solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild\r\n      cornices and furniture, in the Bedlam patterns of the carpets of\r\n      tufted gold! I had become a bounden slave in the trammels of\r\n      opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my\r\n      dreams. But these absurdities I must not pause to detail. Let me\r\n      speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed, whither in a\r\n      moment of mental alienation, I led from the altar as my bride—as\r\n      the successor of the unforgotten Ligeia—the fair-haired and\r\n      blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion, of Tremaine.\r\n\r\n      There is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration\r\n      of that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me. Where\r\n      were the souls of the haughty family of the bride, when, through\r\n      thirst of gold, they permitted to pass the threshold of an\r\n      apartment so bedecked, a maiden and a daughter so beloved? I have\r\n      said that I minutely remember the details of the chamber—yet I am\r\n      sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment—and here there was no\r\n      system, no keeping, in the fantastic display, to take hold upon\r\n      the memory. The room lay in a high turret of the castellated\r\n      abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size. Occupying\r\n      the whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole window—an\r\n      immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice—a single pane, and\r\n      tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or\r\n      moon, passing through it, fell with a ghastly lustre on the\r\n      objects within. Over the upper portion of this huge window,\r\n      extended the trellice-work of an aged vine, which clambered up\r\n      the massy walls of the turret. The ceiling, of gloomy-looking\r\n      oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and elaborately fretted with\r\n      the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-Gothic,\r\n      semi-Druidical device. From out the most central recess of this\r\n      melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single chain of gold with\r\n      long links, a huge censer of the same metal, Saracenic in\r\n      pattern, and with many perforations so contrived that there\r\n      writhed in and out of them, as if endued with a serpent vitality,\r\n      a continual succession of parti-colored fires.\r\n\r\n      Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were\r\n      in various stations about—and there was the couch, too—bridal\r\n      couch—of an Indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony,\r\n      with a pall-like canopy above. In each of the angles of the\r\n      chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite,\r\n      from the tombs of the kings over against Luxor, with their aged\r\n      lids full of immemorial sculpture. But in the draping of the\r\n      apartment lay, alas! the chief phantasy of all. The lofty walls,\r\n      gigantic in height—even unproportionably so—were hung from summit\r\n      to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and massive-looking\r\n      tapestry—tapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet\r\n      on the floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed,\r\n      as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the\r\n      curtains which partially shaded the window. The material was the\r\n      richest cloth of gold. It was spotted all over, at irregular\r\n      intervals, with arabesque figures, about a foot in diameter, and\r\n      wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty black. But\r\n      these figures partook of the true character of the arabesque only\r\n      when regarded from a single point of view. By a contrivance now\r\n      common, and indeed traceable to a very remote period of\r\n      antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. To one entering\r\n      the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; but\r\n      upon a farther advance, this appearance gradually departed; and\r\n      step by step, as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he\r\n      saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly\r\n      forms which belong to the superstition of the Norman, or arise in\r\n      the guilty slumbers of the monk. The phantasmagoric effect was\r\n      vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong\r\n      continual current of wind behind the draperies—giving a hideous\r\n      and uneasy animation to the whole.\r\n\r\n      In halls such as these—in a bridal chamber such as this—I passed,\r\n      with the Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first\r\n      month of our marriage—passed them with but little disquietude.\r\n      That my wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temper—that she\r\n      shunned me and loved me but little—I could not help perceiving;\r\n      but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise. I loathed her with\r\n      a hatred belonging more to demon than to man. My memory flew\r\n      back, (oh, with what intensity of regret!) to Ligeia, the\r\n      beloved, the august, the beautiful, the entombed. I revelled in\r\n      recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty, her\r\n      ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. Now,\r\n      then, did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the\r\n      fires of her own. In the excitement of my opium dreams (for I was\r\n      habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug) I would call\r\n      aloud upon her name, during the silence of the night, or among\r\n      the sheltered recesses of the glens by day, as if, through the\r\n      wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor of my\r\n      longing for the departed, I could restore her to the pathway she\r\n      had abandoned—ah, could it be forever?—upon the earth.\r\n\r\n      About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the\r\n      Lady Rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her\r\n      recovery was slow. The fever which consumed her rendered her\r\n      nights uneasy; and in her perturbed state of half-slumber, she\r\n      spoke of sounds, and of motions, in and about the chamber of the\r\n      turret, which I concluded had no origin save in the distemper of\r\n      her fancy, or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences of the\r\n      chamber itself. She became at length convalescent—finally well.\r\n      Yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a second more violent\r\n      disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from this\r\n      attack her frame, at all times feeble, never altogether\r\n      recovered. Her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming\r\n      character, and of more alarming recurrence, defying alike the\r\n      knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians. With the\r\n      increase of the chronic disease which had thus, apparently, taken\r\n      too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human\r\n      means, I could not fail to observe a similar increase in the\r\n      nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her excitability by\r\n      trivial causes of fear. She spoke again, and now more frequently\r\n      and pertinaciously, of the sounds—of the slight sounds—and of the\r\n      unusual motions among the tapestries, to which she had formerly\r\n      alluded.\r\n\r\n      One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this\r\n      distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my\r\n      attention. She had just awakened from an unquiet slumber, and I\r\n      had been watching, with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague\r\n      terror, the workings of her emaciated countenance. I sat by the\r\n      side of her ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans of India. She\r\n      partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of sounds\r\n      which she then heard, but which I could not hear—of motions which\r\n      she then saw, but which I could not perceive. The wind was\r\n      rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries, and I wished to show her\r\n      (what, let me confess it, I could not all believe) that those\r\n      almost inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations\r\n      of the figures upon the wall, were but the natural effects of\r\n      that customary rushing of the wind. But a deadly pallor,\r\n      overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions to\r\n      reassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to be fainting, and\r\n      no attendants were within call. I remembered where was deposited\r\n      a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her\r\n      physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it. But,\r\n      as I stepped beneath the light of the censer, two circumstances\r\n      of a startling nature attracted my attention. I had felt that\r\n      some palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my\r\n      person; and I saw that there lay upon the golden carpet, in the\r\n      very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the censer, a shadow—a\r\n      faint, indefinite shadow of angelic aspect—such as might be\r\n      fancied for the shadow of a shade. But I was wild with the\r\n      excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and heeded these\r\n      things but little, nor spoke of them to Rowena. Having found the\r\n      wine, I recrossed the chamber, and poured out a gobletful, which\r\n      I held to the lips of the fainting lady. She had now partially\r\n      recovered, however, and took the vessel herself, while I sank\r\n      upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person.\r\n      It was then that I became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall\r\n      upon the carpet, and near the couch; and in a second thereafter,\r\n      as Rowena was in the act of raising the wine to her lips, I saw,\r\n      or may have dreamed that I saw, fall within the goblet, as if\r\n      from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room, three\r\n      or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid. If\r\n      this I saw—not so Rowena. She swallowed the wine unhesitatingly,\r\n      and I forbore to speak to her of a circumstance which must, after\r\n      all, I considered, have been but the suggestion of a vivid\r\n      imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady,\r\n      by the opium, and by the hour.\r\n\r\n      Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately\r\n      subsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the\r\n      worse took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on the\r\n      third subsequent night, the hands of her menials prepared her for\r\n      the tomb, and on the fourth, I sat alone, with her shrouded body,\r\n      in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride.\r\n      Wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like, before me.\r\n      I gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the\r\n      room, upon the varying figures of the drapery, and upon the\r\n      writhing of the parti-colored fires in the censer overhead. My\r\n      eyes then fell, as I called to mind the circumstances of a former\r\n      night, to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where I had\r\n      seen the faint traces of the shadow. It was there, however, no\r\n      longer; and breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances\r\n      to the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed. Then rushed upon me\r\n      a thousand memories of Ligeia—and then came back upon my heart,\r\n      with the turbulent violence of a flood, the whole of that\r\n      unutterable woe with which I had regarded her thus enshrouded.\r\n      The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter thoughts\r\n      of the one only and supremely beloved, I remained gazing upon the\r\n      body of Rowena.\r\n\r\n      It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I\r\n      had taken no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very\r\n      distinct, startled me from my revery. I _felt_ that it came from\r\n      the bed of ebony—the bed of death. I listened in an agony of\r\n      superstitious terror—but there was no repetition of the sound. I\r\n      strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpse—but there\r\n      was not the slightest perceptible. Yet I could not have been\r\n      deceived. I had heard the noise, however faint, and my soul was\r\n      awakened within me. I resolutely and perseveringly kept my\r\n      attention riveted upon the body. Many minutes elapsed before any\r\n      circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery. At\r\n      length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely\r\n      noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and\r\n      along the sunken small veins of the eyelids. Through a species of\r\n      unutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality\r\n      has no sufficiently energetic expression, I felt my heart cease\r\n      to beat, my limbs grow rigid where I sat. Yet a sense of duty\r\n      finally operated to restore my self-possession. I could no longer\r\n      doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparations—that\r\n      Rowena still lived. It was necessary that some immediate exertion\r\n      be made; yet the turret was altogether apart from the portion of\r\n      the abbey tenanted by the servants—there were none within call—I\r\n      had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room\r\n      for many minutes—and this I could not venture to do. I therefore\r\n      struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit ill\r\n      hovering. In a short period it was certain, however, that a\r\n      relapse had taken place; the color disappeared from both eyelid\r\n      and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of marble; the\r\n      lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly\r\n      expression of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness\r\n      overspread rapidly the surface of the body; and all the usual\r\n      rigorous illness immediately supervened. I fell back with a\r\n      shudder upon the couch from which I had been so startlingly\r\n      aroused, and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions of\r\n      Ligeia.\r\n\r\n      An hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?) I was a second\r\n      time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the\r\n      bed. I listened—in extremity of horror. The sound came again—it\r\n      was a sigh. Rushing to the corpse, I saw—distinctly saw—a tremor\r\n      upon the lips. In a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a\r\n      bright line of the pearly teeth. Amazement now struggled in my\r\n      bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there\r\n      alone. I felt that my vision grew dim, that my reason wandered;\r\n      and it was only by a violent effort that I at length succeeded in\r\n      nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had pointed\r\n      out. There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the\r\n      cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame;\r\n      there was even a slight pulsation at the heart. The lady lived;\r\n      and with redoubled ardor I betook myself to the task of\r\n      restoration. I chafed and bathed the temples and the hands, and\r\n      used every exertion which experience, and no little medical\r\n      reading, could suggest. But in vain. Suddenly, the color fled,\r\n      the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of the\r\n      dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body took upon\r\n      itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense rigidity,\r\n      the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of that\r\n      which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.\r\n\r\n      And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia—and again, (what marvel\r\n      that I shudder while I write?), again there reached my ears a low\r\n      sob from the region of the ebony bed. But why shall I minutely\r\n      detail the unspeakable horrors of that night? Why shall I pause\r\n      to relate how, time after time, until near the period of the gray\r\n      dawn, this hideous drama of revivification was repeated; how each\r\n      terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more\r\n      irredeemable death; how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle\r\n      with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was succeeded by I\r\n      know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of the\r\n      corpse? Let me hurry to a conclusion.\r\n\r\n      The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who\r\n      had been dead, once again stirred—and now more vigorously than\r\n      hitherto, although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in\r\n      its utter hopelessness than any. I had long ceased to struggle or\r\n      to move, and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a\r\n      helpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions, of which extreme\r\n      awe was perhaps the least terrible, the least consuming. The\r\n      corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously than before.\r\n      The hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the\r\n      countenance—the limbs relaxed—and, save that the eyelids were yet\r\n      pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of\r\n      the grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure, I\r\n      might have dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly,\r\n      the fetters of Death. But if this idea was not, even then,\r\n      altogether adopted, I could at least doubt no longer, when,\r\n      arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble steps, with closed\r\n      eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream, the thing\r\n      that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the middle\r\n      of the apartment.\r\n\r\n      I trembled not—I stirred not—for a crowd of unutterable fancies\r\n      connected with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure,\r\n      rushing hurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed—had chilled me\r\n      into stone. I stirred not—but gazed upon the apparition. There\r\n      was a mad disorder in my thoughts—a tumult unappeasable. Could\r\n      it, indeed, be the living Rowena who confronted me? Could it\r\n      indeed be Rowena at all—the fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady\r\n      Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine? Why, why should I doubt it? The\r\n      bandage lay heavily about the mouth—but then might it not be the\r\n      mouth of the breathing Lady of Tremaine? And the cheeks—there\r\n      were the roses as in her noon of life—yes, these might indeed be\r\n      the fair cheeks of the living Lady of Tremaine. And the chin,\r\n      with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?—but had she\r\n      then grown taller since her malady? What inexpressible madness\r\n      seized me with that thought? One bound, and I had reached her\r\n      feet! Shrinking from my touch, she let fall from her head,\r\n      unloosened, the ghastly cerements which had confined it, and\r\n      there streamed forth, into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber,\r\n      huge masses of long and dishevelled hair; _it was blacker than\r\n      the raven wings of the midnight!_ And now slowly opened the eyes\r\n      of the figure which stood before me. “Here then, at least,” I\r\n      shrieked aloud, “can I never—can I never be mistaken—these are\r\n      the full, and the black, and the wild eyes—of my lost love—of the\r\n      Lady—of the LADY LIGEIA.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORELLA\r\n\r\n\r\n     Itself, by itself, solely, one everlasting, and single.\r\n                    —PLATO—_Sympos_.\r\n\r\n      With a feeling of deep yet most singular affection I regarded my\r\n      friend Morella. Thrown by accident into her society many years\r\n      ago, my soul from our first meeting, burned with fires it had\r\n      never before known; but the fires were not of Eros, and bitter\r\n      and tormenting to my spirit was the gradual conviction that I\r\n      could in no manner define their unusual meaning or regulate their\r\n      vague intensity. Yet we met; and fate bound us together at the\r\n      altar; and I never spoke of passion nor thought of love. She,\r\n      however, shunned society, and, attaching herself to me alone\r\n      rendered me happy. It is a happiness to wonder; it is a happiness\r\n      to dream.\r\n\r\n      Morella’s erudition was profound. As I hope to live, her talents\r\n      were of no common order—her powers of mind were gigantic. I felt\r\n      this, and, in many matters, became her pupil. I soon, however,\r\n      found that, perhaps on account of her Presburg education, she\r\n      placed before me a number of those mystical writings which are\r\n      usually considered the mere dross of the early German literature.\r\n      These, for what reason I could not imagine, were her favourite\r\n      and constant study—and that in process of time they became my\r\n      own, should be attributed to the simple but effectual influence\r\n      of habit and example.\r\n\r\n      In all this, if I err not, my reason had little to do. My\r\n      convictions, or I forget myself, were in no manner acted upon by\r\n      the ideal, nor was any tincture of the mysticism which I read to\r\n      be discovered, unless I am greatly mistaken, either in my deeds\r\n      or in my thoughts. Persuaded of this, I abandoned myself\r\n      implicitly to the guidance of my wife, and entered with an\r\n      unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies. And\r\n      then—then, when, poring over forbidden pages, I felt a forbidden\r\n      spirit enkindling within me—would Morella place her cold hand\r\n      upon my own, and rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some\r\n      low, singular words, whose strange meaning burned themselves in\r\n      upon my memory. And then, hour after hour, would I linger by her\r\n      side, and dwell upon the music of her voice, until at length its\r\n      melody was tainted with terror, and there fell a shadow upon my\r\n      soul, and I grew pale, and shuddered inwardly at those too\r\n      unearthly tones. And thus, joy suddenly faded into horror, and\r\n      the most beautiful became the most hideous, as Hinnon became\r\n      Ge-Henna.\r\n\r\n      It is unnecessary to state the exact character of those\r\n      disquisitions which, growing out of the volumes I have mentioned,\r\n      formed, for so long a time, almost the sole conversation of\r\n      Morella and myself. By the learned in what might be termed\r\n      theological morality they will be readily conceived, and by the\r\n      unlearned they would, at all events, be little understood. The\r\n      wild Pantheism of Fichte; the modified Paliggenedia of the\r\n      Pythagoreans; and, above all, the doctrines of Identity as urged\r\n      by Schelling, were generally the points of discussion presenting\r\n      the most of beauty to the imaginative Morella. That identity\r\n      which is termed personal, Mr. Locke, I think, truly defines to\r\n      consist in the saneness of rational being. And since by person we\r\n      understand an intelligent essence having reason, and since there\r\n      is a consciousness which always accompanies thinking, it is this\r\n      which makes us all to be that which we call _ourselves_—thereby\r\n      distinguishing us from other beings that think, and giving us our\r\n      personal identity. But the _principium indivduationis_, the\r\n      notion of that identity _which at death is or is not lost\r\n      forever_—was to me, at all times, a consideration of intense\r\n      interest; not more from the perplexing and exciting nature of its\r\n      consequences, than from the marked and agitated manner in which\r\n      Morella mentioned them.\r\n\r\n      But, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of my\r\n      wife’s manner oppressed me as a spell. I could no longer bear the\r\n      touch of her wan fingers, nor the low tone of her musical\r\n      language, nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes. And she knew all\r\n      this, but did not upbraid; she seemed conscious of my weakness or\r\n      my folly, and, smiling, called it Fate. She seemed, also,\r\n      conscious of a cause, to me unknown, for the gradual alienation\r\n      of my regard; but she gave me no hint or token of its nature. Yet\r\n      was she woman, and pined away daily. In time the crimson spot\r\n      settled steadily upon the cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale\r\n      forehead became prominent; and one instant my nature melted into\r\n      pity, but in, next I met the glance of her meaning eyes, and then\r\n      my soul sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who\r\n      gazes downward into some dreary and unfathomable abyss.\r\n\r\n      Shall I then say that I longed with an earnest and consuming\r\n      desire for the moment of Morella’s decease? I did; but the\r\n      fragile spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many days—for\r\n      many weeks and irksome months, until my tortured nerves obtained\r\n      the mastery over my mind, and I grew furious through delay, and,\r\n      with the heart of a fiend, cursed the days and the hours and the\r\n      bitter moments, which seemed to lengthen and lengthen as her\r\n      gentle life declined—like shadows in the dying of the day.\r\n\r\n      But one autumnal evening, when the winds lay still in heaven,\r\n      Morella called me to her bedside. There was a dim mist over all\r\n      the earth, and a warm glow upon the waters, and amid the rich\r\n      October leaves of the forest, a rainbow from the firmament had\r\n      surely fallen.\r\n\r\n      “It is a day of days,” she said, as I approached; “a day of all\r\n      days either to live or die. It is a fair day for the sons of\r\n      earth and life—ah, more fair for the daughters of heaven and\r\n      death!”\r\n\r\n      I kissed her forehead, and she continued:\r\n\r\n      “I am dying, yet shall I live.”\r\n\r\n      “Morella!”\r\n\r\n      “The days have never been when thou couldst love me—but her whom\r\n      in life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt adore.”\r\n\r\n      “Morella!”\r\n\r\n      “I repeat that I am dying. But within me is a pledge of that\r\n      affection—ah, how little!—which thou didst feel for me, Morella.\r\n      And when my spirit departs shall the child live—thy child and\r\n      mine, Morella’s. But thy days shall be days of sorrow—that sorrow\r\n      which is the most lasting of impressions, as the cypress is the\r\n      most enduring of trees. For the hours of thy happiness are over\r\n      and joy is not gathered twice in a life, as the roses of Paestum\r\n      twice in a year. Thou shalt no longer, then, play the Teian with\r\n      time, but, being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine, thou shalt\r\n      bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth, as do the Moslemin\r\n      at Mecca.”\r\n\r\n      “Morella!” I cried, “Morella! how knowest thou this?” but she\r\n      turned away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming\r\n      over her limbs, she thus died, and I heard her voice no more.\r\n\r\n      Yet, as she had foretold, her child, to which in dying she had\r\n      given birth, which breathed not until the mother breathed no\r\n      more, her child, a daughter, lived. And she grew strangely in\r\n      stature and intellect, and was the perfect resemblance of her who\r\n      had departed, and I loved her with a love more fervent than I had\r\n      believed it possible to feel for any denizen of earth.\r\n\r\n      But, ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened,\r\n      and gloom, and horror, and grief swept over it in clouds. I said\r\n      the child grew strangely in stature and intelligence. Strange,\r\n      indeed, was her rapid increase in bodily size—but terrible, oh!\r\n      terrible were the tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while\r\n      watching the development of her mental being. Could it be\r\n      otherwise, when I daily discovered in the conceptions of the\r\n      child the adult powers and faculties of the woman?—when the\r\n      lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy? and when the\r\n      wisdom or the passions of maturity I found hourly gleaming from\r\n      its full and speculative eye? When, I say, all this became\r\n      evident to my appalled senses—when I could no longer hide it from\r\n      my soul, nor throw it off from those perceptions which trembled\r\n      to receive it—is it to be wondered at that suspicions, of a\r\n      nature fearful and exciting, crept in upon my spirit, or that my\r\n      thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales and thrilling\r\n      theories of the entombed Morella? I snatched from the scrutiny of\r\n      the world a being whom destiny compelled me to adore, and in the\r\n      rigorous seclusion of my home, watched with an agonizing anxiety\r\n      over all which concerned the beloved.\r\n\r\n      And as years rolled away, and I gazed day after day upon her\r\n      holy, and mild, and eloquent face, and poured over her maturing\r\n      form, day after day did I discover new points of resemblance in\r\n      the child to her mother, the melancholy and the dead. And hourly\r\n      grew darker these shadows of similitude, and more full, and more\r\n      definite, and more perplexing, and more hideously terrible in\r\n      their aspect. For that her smile was like her mother’s I could\r\n      bear; but then I shuddered at its too perfect _identity_—that her\r\n      eyes were like Morella’s I could endure; but then they, too,\r\n      often looked down into the depths of my soul with Morella’s own\r\n      intense and bewildering meaning. And in the contour of the high\r\n      forehead, and in the ringlets of the silken hair, and in the wan\r\n      fingers which buried themselves therein, and in the sad musical\r\n      tones of her speech, and above all—oh! above all—in the phrases\r\n      and expressions of the dead on the lips of the loved and the\r\n      living, I found food for consuming thought and horror—for a worm\r\n      that _would_ not die.\r\n\r\n      Thus passed away two lustra of her life, and as yet my daughter\r\n      remained nameless upon the earth. “My child,” and “my love,” were\r\n      the designations usually prompted by a father’s affection, and\r\n      the rigid seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse.\r\n      Morella’s name died with her at her death. Of the mother I had\r\n      never spoken to the daughter;—it was impossible to speak. Indeed,\r\n      during the brief period of her existence, the latter had received\r\n      no impressions from the outward world, save such as might have\r\n      been afforded by the narrow limits of her privacy. But at length\r\n      the ceremony of baptism presented to my mind, in its unnerved and\r\n      agitated condition, a present deliverance from the terrors of my\r\n      destiny. And at the baptismal font I hesitated for a name. And\r\n      many titles of the wise and beautiful, of old and modern times,\r\n      of my own and foreign lands, came thronging to my lips, with\r\n      many, many fair titles of the gentle, and the happy, and the\r\n      good. What prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried\r\n      dead? What demon urged me to breathe that sound, which in its\r\n      very recollection was wont to make ebb the purple blood in\r\n      torrents from the temples to the heart? What fiend spoke from the\r\n      recesses of my soul, when amid those dim aisles, and in the\r\n      silence of the night, I whispered within the ears of the holy man\r\n      the syllables—Morella? What more than fiend convulsed the\r\n      features of my child, and overspread them with hues of death, as\r\n      starting at that scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy\r\n      eyes from the earth to heaven, and falling prostrate on the black\r\n      slabs of our ancestral vault, responded—“I am here!”\r\n\r\n      Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell those few simple sounds\r\n      within my ear, and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into\r\n      my brain. Years—years may pass away, but the memory of that\r\n      epoch—never! Nor was I indeed ignorant of the flowers and the\r\n      vine—but the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed me night and\r\n      day. And I kept no reckoning of time or place, and the stars of\r\n      my fate faded from heaven, and therefore the earth grew dark, and\r\n      its figures passed by me like flitting shadows, and among them\r\n      all I beheld only—Morella. The winds of the firmament breathed\r\n      but one sound within my ears, and the ripples upon the sea\r\n      murmured evermore—Morella. But she died; and with my own hands I\r\n      bore her to the tomb; and I laughed with a long and bitter laugh\r\n      as I found no traces of the first in the charnel where I laid the\r\n      second, Morella.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE OF THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\n      During the fall of the year 1827, while residing near\r\n      Charlottesville, Virginia, I casually made the acquaintance of\r\n      Mr. Augustus Bedloe. This young gentleman was remarkable in every\r\n      respect, and excited in me a profound interest and curiosity. I\r\n      found it impossible to comprehend him either in his moral or his\r\n      physical relations. Of his family I could obtain no satisfactory\r\n      account. Whence he came, I never ascertained. Even about his\r\n      age—although I call him a young gentleman—there was something\r\n      which perplexed me in no little degree. He certainly seemed\r\n      young—and he made a point of speaking about his youth—yet there\r\n      were moments when I should have had little trouble in imagining\r\n      him a hundred years of age. But in no regard was he more peculiar\r\n      than in his personal appearance. He was singularly tall and thin.\r\n      He stooped much. His limbs were exceedingly long and emaciated.\r\n      His forehead was broad and low. His complexion was absolutely\r\n      bloodless. His mouth was large and flexible, and his teeth were\r\n      more wildly uneven, although sound, than I had ever before seen\r\n      teeth in a human head. The expression of his smile, however, was\r\n      by no means unpleasing, as might be supposed; but it had no\r\n      variation whatever. It was one of profound melancholy—of a\r\n      phaseless and unceasing gloom. His eyes were abnormally large,\r\n      and round like those of a cat. The pupils, too, upon any\r\n      accession or diminution of light, underwent contraction or\r\n      dilation, just such as is observed in the feline tribe. In\r\n      moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost\r\n      inconceivable; seeming to emit luminous rays, not of a reflected\r\n      but of an intrinsic lustre, as does a candle or the sun; yet\r\n      their ordinary condition was so totally vapid, filmy, and dull as\r\n      to convey the idea of the eyes of a long-interred corpse.\r\n\r\n      These peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much\r\n      annoyance, and he was continually alluding to them in a sort of\r\n      half explanatory, half apologetic strain, which, when I first\r\n      heard it, impressed me very painfully. I soon, however, grew\r\n      accustomed to it, and my uneasiness wore off. It seemed to be his\r\n      design rather to insinuate than directly to assert that,\r\n      physically, he had not always been what he was—that a long series\r\n      of neuralgic attacks had reduced him from a condition of more\r\n      than usual personal beauty, to that which I saw. For many years\r\n      past he had been attended by a physician, named Templeton—an old\r\n      gentleman, perhaps seventy years of age—whom he had first\r\n      encountered at Saratoga, and from whose attention, while there,\r\n      he either received, or fancied that he received, great benefit.\r\n      The result was that Bedloe, who was wealthy, had made an\r\n      arrangement with Dr. Templeton, by which the latter, in\r\n      consideration of a liberal annual allowance, had consented to\r\n      devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the care of\r\n      the invalid.\r\n\r\n      Doctor Templeton had been a traveller in his younger days, and at\r\n      Paris had become a convert, in great measure, to the doctrines of\r\n      Mesmer. It was altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he\r\n      had succeeded in alleviating the acute pains of his patient; and\r\n      this success had very naturally inspired the latter with a\r\n      certain degree of confidence in the opinions from which the\r\n      remedies had been educed. The Doctor, however, like all\r\n      enthusiasts, had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of his\r\n      pupil, and finally so far gained his point as to induce the\r\n      sufferer to submit to numerous experiments. By a frequent\r\n      repetition of these, a result had arisen, which of late days has\r\n      become so common as to attract little or no attention, but which,\r\n      at the period of which I write, had very rarely been known in\r\n      America. I mean to say, that between Doctor Templeton and Bedloe\r\n      there had grown up, little by little, a very distinct and\r\n      strongly marked rapport, or magnetic relation. I am not prepared\r\n      to assert, however, that this rapport extended beyond the limits\r\n      of the simple sleep-producing power, but this power itself had\r\n      attained great intensity. At the first attempt to induce the\r\n      magnetic somnolency, the mesmerist entirely failed. In the fifth\r\n      or sixth he succeeded very partially, and after long continued\r\n      effort. Only at the twelfth was the triumph complete. After this\r\n      the will of the patient succumbed rapidly to that of the\r\n      physician, so that, when I first became acquainted with the two,\r\n      sleep was brought about almost instantaneously by the mere\r\n      volition of the operator, even when the invalid was unaware of\r\n      his presence. It is only now, in the year 1845, when similar\r\n      miracles are witnessed daily by thousands, that I dare venture to\r\n      record this apparent impossibility as a matter of serious fact.\r\n\r\n      The temperature of Bedloe was, in the highest degree sensitive,\r\n      excitable, enthusiastic. His imagination was singularly vigorous\r\n      and creative; and no doubt it derived additional force from the\r\n      habitual use of morphine, which he swallowed in great quantity,\r\n      and without which he would have found it impossible to exist. It\r\n      was his practice to take a very large dose of it immediately\r\n      after breakfast each morning—or, rather, immediately after a cup\r\n      of strong coffee, for he ate nothing in the forenoon—and then set\r\n      forth alone, or attended only by a dog, upon a long ramble among\r\n      the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward and\r\n      southward of Charlottesville, and are there dignified by the\r\n      title of the Ragged Mountains.\r\n\r\n      Upon a dim, warm, misty day, toward the close of November, and\r\n      during the strange interregnum of the seasons which in America is\r\n      termed the Indian Summer, Mr. Bedloe departed as usual for the\r\n      hills. The day passed, and still he did not return.\r\n\r\n      About eight o’clock at night, having become seriously alarmed at\r\n      his protracted absence, we were about setting out in search of\r\n      him, when he unexpectedly made his appearance, in health no worse\r\n      than usual, and in rather more than ordinary spirits. The account\r\n      which he gave of his expedition, and of the events which had\r\n      detained him, was a singular one indeed.\r\n\r\n      “You will remember,” said he, “that it was about nine in the\r\n      morning when I left Charlottesville. I bent my steps immediately\r\n      to the mountains, and, about ten, entered a gorge which was\r\n      entirely new to me. I followed the windings of this pass with\r\n      much interest. The scenery which presented itself on all sides,\r\n      although scarcely entitled to be called grand, had about it an\r\n      indescribable and to me a delicious aspect of dreary desolation.\r\n      The solitude seemed absolutely virgin. I could not help believing\r\n      that the green sods and the gray rocks upon which I trod had been\r\n      trodden never before by the foot of a human being. So entirely\r\n      secluded, and in fact inaccessible, except through a series of\r\n      accidents, is the entrance of the ravine, that it is by no means\r\n      impossible that I was indeed the first adventurer—the very first\r\n      and sole adventurer who had ever penetrated its recesses.\r\n\r\n      “The thick and peculiar mist, or smoke, which distinguishes the\r\n      Indian Summer, and which now hung heavily over all objects,\r\n      served, no doubt, to deepen the vague impressions which these\r\n      objects created. So dense was this pleasant fog that I could at\r\n      no time see more than a dozen yards of the path before me. This\r\n      path was excessively sinuous, and as the sun could not be seen, I\r\n      soon lost all idea of the direction in which I journeyed. In the\r\n      meantime the morphine had its customary effect—that of enduing\r\n      all the external world with an intensity of interest. In the\r\n      quivering of a leaf—in the hue of a blade of grass—in the shape\r\n      of a trefoil—in the humming of a bee—in the gleaming of a\r\n      dew-drop—in the breathing of the wind—in the faint odors that\r\n      came from the forest—there came a whole universe of suggestion—a\r\n      gay and motley train of rhapsodical and immethodical thought.\r\n\r\n      “Busied in this, I walked on for several hours, during which the\r\n      mist deepened around me to so great an extent that at length I\r\n      was reduced to an absolute groping of the way. And now an\r\n      indescribable uneasiness possessed me—a species of nervous\r\n      hesitation and tremor. I feared to tread, lest I should be\r\n      precipitated into some abyss. I remembered, too, strange stories\r\n      told about these Ragged Hills, and of the uncouth and fierce\r\n      races of men who tenanted their groves and caverns. A thousand\r\n      vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted me—fancies the more\r\n      distressing because vague. Very suddenly my attention was\r\n      arrested by the loud beating of a drum.\r\n\r\n      “My amazement was, of course, extreme. A drum in these hills was\r\n      a thing unknown. I could not have been more surprised at the\r\n      sound of the trump of the Archangel. But a new and still more\r\n      astounding source of interest and perplexity arose. There came a\r\n      wild rattling or jingling sound, as if of a bunch of large keys,\r\n      and upon the instant a dusky-visaged and half-naked man rushed\r\n      past me with a shriek. He came so close to my person that I felt\r\n      his hot breath upon my face. He bore in one hand an instrument\r\n      composed of an assemblage of steel rings, and shook them\r\n      vigorously as he ran. Scarcely had he disappeared in the mist\r\n      before, panting after him, with open mouth and glaring eyes,\r\n      there darted a huge beast. I could not be mistaken in its\r\n      character. It was a hyena.\r\n\r\n      “The sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my\r\n      terrors—for I now made sure that I dreamed, and endeavored to\r\n      arouse myself to waking consciousness. I stepped boldly and\r\n      briskly forward. I rubbed my eyes. I called aloud. I pinched my\r\n      limbs. A small spring of water presented itself to my view, and\r\n      here, stooping, I bathed my hands and my head and neck. This\r\n      seemed to dissipate the equivocal sensations which had hitherto\r\n      annoyed me. I arose, as I thought, a new man, and proceeded\r\n      steadily and complacently on my unknown way.\r\n\r\n      “At length, quite overcome by exertion, and by a certain\r\n      oppressive closeness of the atmosphere, I seated myself beneath a\r\n      tree. Presently there came a feeble gleam of sunshine, and the\r\n      shadow of the leaves of the tree fell faintly but definitely upon\r\n      the grass. At this shadow I gazed wonderingly for many minutes.\r\n      Its character stupefied me with astonishment. I looked upward.\r\n      The tree was a palm.\r\n\r\n      “I now arose hurriedly, and in a state of fearful agitation—for\r\n      the fancy that I dreamed would serve me no longer. I saw—I felt\r\n      that I had perfect command of my senses—and these senses now\r\n      brought to my soul a world of novel and singular sensation. The\r\n      heat became all at once intolerable. A strange odor loaded the\r\n      breeze. A low, continuous murmur, like that arising from a full,\r\n      but gently flowing river, came to my ears, intermingled with the\r\n      peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices.\r\n\r\n      “While I listened in an extremity of astonishment which I need\r\n      not attempt to describe, a strong and brief gust of wind bore off\r\n      the incumbent fog as if by the wand of an enchanter.\r\n\r\n      “I found myself at the foot of a high mountain, and looking down\r\n      into a vast plain, through which wound a majestic river. On the\r\n      margin of this river stood an Eastern-looking city, such as we\r\n      read of in the Arabian Tales, but of a character even more\r\n      singular than any there described. From my position, which was\r\n      far above the level of the town, I could perceive its every nook\r\n      and corner, as if delineated on a map. The streets seemed\r\n      innumerable, and crossed each other irregularly in all\r\n      directions, but were rather long winding alleys than streets, and\r\n      absolutely swarmed with inhabitants. The houses were wildly\r\n      picturesque. On every hand was a wilderness of balconies, of\r\n      verandas, of minarets, of shrines, and fantastically carved\r\n      oriels. Bazaars abounded; and in these were displayed rich wares\r\n      in infinite variety and profusion—silks, muslins, the most\r\n      dazzling cutlery, the most magnificent jewels and gems. Besides\r\n      these things, were seen, on all sides, banners and palanquins,\r\n      litters with stately dames close-veiled, elephants gorgeously\r\n      caparisoned, idols grotesquely hewn, drums, banners, and gongs,\r\n      spears, silver and gilded maces. And amid the crowd, and the\r\n      clamor, and the general intricacy and confusion—amid the million\r\n      of black and yellow men, turbaned and robed, and of flowing\r\n      beard, there roamed a countless multitude of holy filleted bulls,\r\n      while vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered,\r\n      chattering and shrieking, about the cornices of the mosques, or\r\n      clung to the minarets and oriels. From the swarming streets to\r\n      the banks of the river, there descended innumerable flights of\r\n      steps leading to bathing places, while the river itself seemed to\r\n      force a passage with difficulty through the vast fleets of\r\n      deeply-burthened ships that far and wide encountered its surface.\r\n      Beyond the limits of the city arose, in frequent majestic groups,\r\n      the palm and the cocoa, with other gigantic and weird trees of\r\n      vast age; and here and there might be seen a field of rice, the\r\n      thatched hut of a peasant, a tank, a stray temple, a gypsy camp,\r\n      or a solitary graceful maiden taking her way, with a pitcher upon\r\n      her head, to the banks of the magnificent river.\r\n\r\n      “You will say now, of course, that I dreamed; but not so. What I\r\n      saw—what I heard—what I felt—what I thought—had about it nothing\r\n      of the unmistakable idiosyncrasy of the dream. All was rigorously\r\n      self-consistent. At first, doubting that I was really awake, I\r\n      entered into a series of tests, which soon convinced me that I\r\n      really was. Now, when one dreams, and, in the dream, suspects\r\n      that he dreams, the suspicion never fails to confirm itself, and\r\n      the sleeper is almost immediately aroused. Thus Novalis errs not\r\n      in saying that ‘we are near waking when we dream that we dream.’\r\n      Had the vision occurred to me as I describe it, without my\r\n      suspecting it as a dream, then a dream it might absolutely have\r\n      been, but, occurring as it did, and suspected and tested as it\r\n      was, I am forced to class it among other phenomena.”\r\n\r\n      “In this I am not sure that you are wrong,” observed Dr.\r\n      Templeton, “but proceed. You arose and descended into the city.”\r\n\r\n      “I arose,” continued Bedloe, regarding the Doctor with an air of\r\n      profound astonishment “I arose, as you say, and descended into\r\n      the city. On my way I fell in with an immense populace, crowding\r\n      through every avenue, all in the same direction, and exhibiting\r\n      in every action the wildest excitement. Very suddenly, and by\r\n      some inconceivable impulse, I became intensely imbued with\r\n      personal interest in what was going on. I seemed to feel that I\r\n      had an important part to play, without exactly understanding what\r\n      it was. Against the crowd which environed me, however, I\r\n      experienced a deep sentiment of animosity. I shrank from amid\r\n      them, and, swiftly, by a circuitous path, reached and entered the\r\n      city. Here all was the wildest tumult and contention. A small\r\n      party of men, clad in garments half Indian, half European, and\r\n      officered by gentlemen in a uniform partly British, were engaged,\r\n      at great odds, with the swarming rabble of the alleys. I joined\r\n      the weaker party, arming myself with the weapons of a fallen\r\n      officer, and fighting I knew not whom with the nervous ferocity\r\n      of despair. We were soon overpowered by numbers, and driven to\r\n      seek refuge in a species of kiosk. Here we barricaded ourselves,\r\n      and, for the present were secure. From a loop-hole near the\r\n      summit of the kiosk, I perceived a vast crowd, in furious\r\n      agitation, surrounding and assaulting a gay palace that overhung\r\n      the river. Presently, from an upper window of this place, there\r\n      descended an effeminate-looking person, by means of a string made\r\n      of the turbans of his attendants. A boat was at hand, in which he\r\n      escaped to the opposite bank of the river.\r\n\r\n      “And now a new object took possession of my soul. I spoke a few\r\n      hurried but energetic words to my companions, and, having\r\n      succeeded in gaining over a few of them to my purpose made a\r\n      frantic sally from the kiosk. We rushed amid the crowd that\r\n      surrounded it. They retreated, at first, before us. They rallied,\r\n      fought madly, and retreated again. In the mean time we were borne\r\n      far from the kiosk, and became bewildered and entangled among the\r\n      narrow streets of tall, overhanging houses, into the recesses of\r\n      which the sun had never been able to shine. The rabble pressed\r\n      impetuously upon us, harrassing us with their spears, and\r\n      overwhelming us with flights of arrows. These latter were very\r\n      remarkable, and resembled in some respects the writhing creese of\r\n      the Malay. They were made to imitate the body of a creeping\r\n      serpent, and were long and black, with a poisoned barb. One of\r\n      them struck me upon the right temple. I reeled and fell. An\r\n      instantaneous and dreadful sickness seized me. I struggled—I\r\n      gasped—I died.”\r\n\r\n       “You will hardly persist _now_,” said I smiling, “that the whole\r\n       of your adventure was not a dream. You are not prepared to\r\n       maintain that you are dead?”\r\n\r\n      When I said these words, I of course expected some lively sally\r\n      from Bedloe in reply, but, to my astonishment, he hesitated,\r\n      trembled, became fearfully pallid, and remained silent. I looked\r\n      toward Templeton. He sat erect and rigid in his chair—his teeth\r\n      chattered, and his eyes were starting from their sockets.\r\n      “Proceed!” he at length said hoarsely to Bedloe.\r\n\r\n      “For many minutes,” continued the latter, “my sole sentiment—my\r\n      sole feeling—was that of darkness and nonentity, with the\r\n      consciousness of death. At length there seemed to pass a violent\r\n      and sudden shock through my soul, as if of electricity. With it\r\n      came the sense of elasticity and of light. This latter I felt—not\r\n      saw. In an instant I seemed to rise from the ground. But I had no\r\n      bodily, no visible, audible, or palpable presence. The crowd had\r\n      departed. The tumult had ceased. The city was in comparative\r\n      repose. Beneath me lay my corpse, with the arrow in my temple,\r\n      the whole head greatly swollen and disfigured. But all these\r\n      things I felt—not saw. I took interest in nothing. Even the\r\n      corpse seemed a matter in which I had no concern. Volition I had\r\n      none, but appeared to be impelled into motion, and flitted\r\n      buoyantly out of the city, retracing the circuitous path by which\r\n      I had entered it. When I had attained that point of the ravine in\r\n      the mountains at which I had encountered the hyena, I again\r\n      experienced a shock as of a galvanic battery; the sense of\r\n      weight, of volition, of substance, returned. I became my original\r\n      self, and bent my steps eagerly homeward—but the past had not\r\n      lost the vividness of the real—and not now, even for an instant,\r\n      can I compel my understanding to regard it as a dream.”\r\n\r\n      “Nor was it,” said Templeton, with an air of deep solemnity, “yet\r\n      it would be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed.\r\n      Let us suppose only, that the soul of the man of to-day is upon\r\n      the verge of some stupendous psychal discoveries. Let us content\r\n      ourselves with this supposition. For the rest I have some\r\n      explanation to make. Here is a watercolor drawing, which I should\r\n      have shown you before, but which an unaccountable sentiment of\r\n      horror has hitherto prevented me from showing.”\r\n\r\n      We looked at the picture which he presented. I saw nothing in it\r\n      of an extraordinary character, but its effect upon Bedloe was\r\n      prodigious. He nearly fainted as he gazed. And yet it was but a\r\n      miniature portrait—a miraculously accurate one, to be sure—of his\r\n      own very remarkable features. At least this was my thought as I\r\n      regarded it.\r\n\r\n      “You will perceive,” said Templeton, “the date of this picture—it\r\n      is here, scarcely visible, in this corner—1780. In this year was\r\n      the portrait taken. It is the likeness of a dead friend—a Mr.\r\n      Oldeb—to whom I became much attached at Calcutta, during the\r\n      administration of Warren Hastings. I was then only twenty years\r\n      old. When I first saw you, Mr. Bedloe, at Saratoga, it was the\r\n      miraculous similarity which existed between yourself and the\r\n      painting which induced me to accost you, to seek your friendship,\r\n      and to bring about those arrangements which resulted in my\r\n      becoming your constant companion. In accomplishing this point, I\r\n      was urged partly, and perhaps principally, by a regretful memory\r\n      of the deceased, but also, in part, by an uneasy, and not\r\n      altogether horrorless curiosity respecting yourself.\r\n\r\n      “In your detail of the vision which presented itself to you amid\r\n      the hills, you have described, with the minutest accuracy, the\r\n      Indian city of Benares, upon the Holy River. The riots, the\r\n      combat, the massacre, were the actual events of the insurrection\r\n      of Cheyte Sing, which took place in 1780, when Hastings was put\r\n      in imminent peril of his life. The man escaping by the string of\r\n      turbans was Cheyte Sing himself. The party in the kiosk were\r\n      sepoys and British officers, headed by Hastings. Of this party I\r\n      was one, and did all I could to prevent the rash and fatal sally\r\n      of the officer who fell, in the crowded alleys, by the poisoned\r\n      arrow of a Bengalee. That officer was my dearest friend. It was\r\n      Oldeb. You will perceive by these manuscripts,” (here the speaker\r\n      produced a note-book in which several pages appeared to have been\r\n      freshly written,) “that at the very period in which you fancied\r\n      these things amid the hills, I was engaged in detailing them upon\r\n      paper here at home.”\r\n\r\n      In about a week after this conversation, the following paragraphs\r\n      appeared in a Charlottesville paper:\r\n\r\n      “We have the painful duty of announcing the death of Mr. Augustus\r\n      Bedlo, a gentleman whose amiable manners and many virtues have\r\n      long endeared him to the citizens of Charlottesville.\r\n\r\n      “Mr. B., for some years past, has been subject to neuralgia,\r\n      which has often threatened to terminate fatally; but this can be\r\n      regarded only as the mediate cause of his decease. The proximate\r\n      cause was one of especial singularity. In an excursion to the\r\n      Ragged Mountains, a few days since, a slight cold and fever were\r\n      contracted, attended with great determination of blood to the\r\n      head. To relieve this, Dr. Templeton resorted to topical\r\n      bleeding. Leeches were applied to the temples. In a fearfully\r\n      brief period the patient died, when it appeared that in the jar\r\n      containing the leeches, had been introduced, by accident, one of\r\n      the venomous vermicular sangsues which are now and then found in\r\n      the neighboring ponds. This creature fastened itself upon a small\r\n      artery in the right temple. Its close resemblance to the\r\n      medicinal leech caused the mistake to be overlooked until too\r\n      late.\r\n\r\n      “N. B.—The poisonous sangsue of Charlottesville may always be\r\n      distinguished from the medicinal leech by its blackness, and\r\n      especially by its writhing or vermicular motions, which very\r\n      nearly resemble those of a snake.”\r\n\r\n      I was speaking with the editor of the paper in question, upon the\r\n      topic of this remarkable accident, when it occurred to me to ask\r\n      how it happened that the name of the deceased had been given as\r\n      Bedlo.\r\n\r\n      “I presume,” I said, “you have authority for this spelling, but I\r\n      have always supposed the name to be written with an e at the\r\n      end.”\r\n\r\n      “Authority?—no,” he replied. “It is a mere typographical error.\r\n      The name is Bedlo with an e, all the world over, and I never knew\r\n      it to be spelt otherwise in my life.”\r\n\r\n      “Then,” said I mutteringly, as I turned upon my heel, “then\r\n      indeed has it come to pass that one truth is stranger than any\r\n      fiction—for Bedloe, without the e, what is it but Oldeb\r\n      conversed! And this man tells me that it is a typographical\r\n      error.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPECTACLES\r\n\r\n\r\n      Many years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of “love\r\n      at first sight;” but those who think, not less than those who\r\n      feel deeply, have always advocated its existence. Modern\r\n      discoveries, indeed, in what may be termed ethical magnetism or\r\n      magnetoesthetics, render it probable that the most natural, and,\r\n      consequently, the truest and most intense of the human affections\r\n      are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy—in\r\n      a word, that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal\r\n      fetters are those which are riveted by a glance. The confession I\r\n      am about to make will add another to the already almost\r\n      innumerable instances of the truth of the position.\r\n\r\n      My story requires that I should be somewhat minute. I am still a\r\n      very young man—not yet twenty-two years of age. My name, at\r\n      present, is a very usual and rather plebeian one—Simpson. I say\r\n      “at present;” for it is only lately that I have been so\r\n      called—having legislatively adopted this surname within the last\r\n      year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant\r\n      male relative, Adolphus Simpson, Esq. The bequest was conditioned\r\n      upon my taking the name of the testator,—the family, not the\r\n      Christian name; my Christian name is Napoleon Bonaparte—or, more\r\n      properly, these are my first and middle appellations.\r\n\r\n      I assumed the name, Simpson, with some reluctance, as in my true\r\n      patronym, Froissart, I felt a very pardonable pride—believing\r\n      that I could trace a descent from the immortal author of the\r\n      “Chronicles.” While on the subject of names, by the bye, I may\r\n      mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of\r\n      some of my immediate predecessors. My father was a Monsieur\r\n      Froissart, of Paris. His wife—my mother, whom he married at\r\n      fifteen—was a Mademoiselle Croissart, eldest daughter of\r\n      Croissart the banker, whose wife, again, being only sixteen when\r\n      married, was the eldest daughter of one Victor Voissart. Monsieur\r\n      Voissart, very singularly, had married a lady of similar name—a\r\n      Mademoiselle Moissart. She, too, was quite a child when married;\r\n      and her mother, also, Madame Moissart, was only fourteen when led\r\n      to the altar. These early marriages are usual in France. Here,\r\n      however, are Moissart, Voissart, Croissart, and Froissart, all in\r\n      the direct line of descent. My own name, though, as I say, became\r\n      Simpson, by act of Legislature, and with so much repugnance on my\r\n      part, that, at one period, I actually hesitated about accepting\r\n      the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached.\r\n\r\n      As to personal endowments, I am by no means deficient. On the\r\n      contrary, I believe that I am well made, and possess what nine\r\n      tenths of the world would call a handsome face. In height I am\r\n      five feet eleven. My hair is black and curling. My nose is\r\n      sufficiently good. My eyes are large and gray; and although, in\r\n      fact they are weak to a very inconvenient degree, still no defect\r\n      in this regard would be suspected from their appearance. The\r\n      weakness itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and I have\r\n      resorted to every remedy—short of wearing glasses. Being youthful\r\n      and good-looking, I naturally dislike these, and have resolutely\r\n      refused to employ them. I know nothing, indeed, which so\r\n      disfigures the countenance of a young person, or so impresses\r\n      every feature with an air of demureness, if not altogether of\r\n      sanctimoniousness and of age. An eyeglass, on the other hand, has\r\n      a savor of downright foppery and affectation. I have hitherto\r\n      managed as well as I could without either. But something too much\r\n      of these merely personal details, which, after all, are of little\r\n      importance. I will content myself with saying, in addition, that\r\n      my temperament is sanguine, rash, ardent, enthusiastic—and that\r\n      all my life I have been a devoted admirer of the women.\r\n\r\n      One night last winter I entered a box at the P—— Theatre, in\r\n      company with a friend, Mr. Talbot. It was an opera night, and the\r\n      bills presented a very rare attraction, so that the house was\r\n      excessively crowded. We were in time, however, to obtain the\r\n      front seats which had been reserved for us, and into which, with\r\n      some little difficulty, we elbowed our way.\r\n\r\n      For two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave his\r\n      undivided attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, I amused\r\n      myself by observing the audience, which consisted, in chief part,\r\n      of the very elite of the city. Having satisfied myself upon this\r\n      point, I was about turning my eyes to the prima donna, when they\r\n      were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes\r\n      which had escaped my observation.\r\n\r\n      If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the intense\r\n      emotion with which I regarded this figure. It was that of a\r\n      female, the most exquisite I had ever beheld. The face was so far\r\n      turned toward the stage that, for some minutes, I could not\r\n      obtain a view of it—but the form was divine; no other word can\r\n      sufficiently express its magnificent proportion—and even the term\r\n      “divine” seems ridiculously feeble as I write it.\r\n\r\n      The magic of a lovely form in woman—the necromancy of female\r\n      gracefulness—was always a power which I had found it impossible\r\n      to resist, but here was grace personified, incarnate, the beau\r\n      ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions. The figure,\r\n      almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be\r\n      seen, was somewhat above the medium height, and nearly\r\n      approached, without positively reaching, the majestic. Its\r\n      perfect fullness and tournure were delicious. The head, of which\r\n      only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that of the Greek\r\n      Psyche, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap\r\n      of _gaze äérienne_, which put me in mind of the _ventum textilem_\r\n      of Apuleius. The right arm hung over the balustrade of the box,\r\n      and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry.\r\n      Its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves\r\n      now in fashion. This extended but little below the elbow. Beneath\r\n      it was worn an under one of some frail material, close-fitting,\r\n      and terminated by a cuff of rich lace, which fell gracefully over\r\n      the top of the hand, revealing only the delicate fingers, upon\r\n      one of which sparkled a diamond ring, which I at once saw was of\r\n      extraordinary value. The admirable roundness of the wrist was\r\n      well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and which also was\r\n      ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of\r\n      jewels—telling, in words that could not be mistaken, at once of\r\n      the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer.\r\n\r\n      I gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour, as\r\n      if I had been suddenly converted to stone; and, during this\r\n      period, I felt the full force and truth of all that has been said\r\n      or sung concerning “love at first sight.” My feelings were\r\n      totally different from any which I had hitherto experienced, in\r\n      the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female\r\n      loveliness. An unaccountable, and what I am compelled to consider\r\n      a magnetic, sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, not only\r\n      my vision, but my whole powers of thought and feeling, upon the\r\n      admirable object before me. I saw—I felt—I knew that I was\r\n      deeply, madly, irrevocably in love—and this even before seeing\r\n      the face of the person beloved. So intense, indeed, was the\r\n      passion that consumed me, that I really believe it would have\r\n      received little if any abatement had the features, yet unseen,\r\n      proved of merely ordinary character; so anomalous is the nature\r\n      of the only true love—of the love at first sight—and so little\r\n      really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only\r\n      seem to create and control it.\r\n\r\n      While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision, a\r\n      sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head\r\n      partially toward me, so that I beheld the entire profile of the\r\n      face. Its beauty even exceeded my anticipations—and yet there was\r\n      something about it which disappointed me without my being able to\r\n      tell exactly what it was. I said “disappointed,” but this is not\r\n      altogether the word. My sentiments were at once quieted and\r\n      exalted. They partook less of transport and more of calm\r\n      enthusiasm—of enthusiastic repose. This state of feeling arose,\r\n      perhaps, from the Madonna-like and matronly air of the face; and\r\n      yet I at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely\r\n      from this. There was something else—some mystery which I could\r\n      not develope—some expression about the countenance which slightly\r\n      disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest. In fact, I\r\n      was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and\r\n      susceptible man for any act of extravagance. Had the lady been\r\n      alone, I should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her\r\n      at all hazards; but, fortunately, she was attended by two\r\n      companions—a gentleman, and a strikingly beautiful woman, to all\r\n      appearance a few years younger than herself.\r\n\r\n      I revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which I might obtain,\r\n      hereafter, an introduction to the elder lady, or, for the\r\n      present, at all events, a more distinct view of her beauty. I\r\n      would have removed my position to one nearer her own, but the\r\n      crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible; and the\r\n      stern decrees of Fashion had, of late, imperatively prohibited\r\n      the use of the opera-glass in a case such as this, even had I\r\n      been so fortunate as to have one with me—but I had not—and was\r\n      thus in despair.\r\n\r\n      At length I bethought me of applying to my companion.\r\n\r\n      “Talbot,” I said, “you have an opera-glass. Let me have it.”\r\n\r\n      “An opera-glass!—no!—what do you suppose I would be doing with an\r\n      opera-glass?” Here he turned impatiently toward the stage.\r\n\r\n      “But, Talbot,” I continued, pulling him by the shoulder, “listen\r\n      to me will you? Do you see the stage-box?—there!—no, the next.—\r\n      Did you ever behold as lovely a woman?”\r\n\r\n      “She is very beautiful, no doubt,” he said.\r\n\r\n      “I wonder who she can be?”\r\n\r\n      “Why, in the name of all that is angelic, don’t you know who she\r\n      is? ‘Not to know her argues yourself unknown.’ She is the\r\n      celebrated Madame Lalande—the beauty of the day par excellence,\r\n      and the talk of the whole town. Immensely wealthy too—a widow,\r\n      and a great match—has just arrived from Paris.”\r\n\r\n      “Do you know her?”\r\n\r\n      “Yes; I have the honor.”\r\n\r\n      “Will you introduce me?”\r\n\r\n      “Assuredly, with the greatest pleasure; when shall it be?”\r\n\r\n      “To-morrow, at one, I will call upon you at B—’s.”\r\n\r\n      “Very good; and now do hold your tongue, if you can.”\r\n\r\n      In this latter respect I was forced to take Talbot’s advice; for\r\n      he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or\r\n      suggestion, and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the\r\n      evening with what was transacting upon the stage.\r\n\r\n      In the meantime I kept my eyes riveted on Madame Lalande, and at\r\n      length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her\r\n      face. It was exquisitely lovely—this, of course, my heart had\r\n      told me before, even had not Talbot fully satisfied me upon the\r\n      point—but still the unintelligible something disturbed me. I\r\n      finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air\r\n      of gravity, sadness, or, still more properly, of weariness, which\r\n      took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance,\r\n      only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty, and\r\n      thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment, with\r\n      an interest tenfold.\r\n\r\n      While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to my great\r\n      trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the\r\n      lady, that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my\r\n      gaze. Still, I was absolutely fascinated, and could not withdraw\r\n      it, even for an instant. She turned aside her face, and again I\r\n      saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head.\r\n      After some minutes, as if urged by curiosity to see if I was\r\n      still looking, she gradually brought her face again around and\r\n      again encountered my burning gaze. Her large dark eyes fell\r\n      instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek. But what was my\r\n      astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second\r\n      time avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a\r\n      double eyeglass—elevated it—adjusted it—and then regarded me\r\n      through it, intently and deliberately, for the space of several\r\n      minutes.\r\n\r\n      Had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet I could not have been more\r\n      thoroughly astounded—astounded only—not offended or disgusted in\r\n      the slightest degree; although an action so bold in any other\r\n      woman would have been likely to offend or disgust. But the whole\r\n      thing was done with so much quietude—so much nonchalance—so much\r\n      repose—with so evident an air of the highest breeding, in\r\n      short—that nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible, and my\r\n      sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise.\r\n\r\n      I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass, she had\r\n      seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, and\r\n      was withdrawing the instrument, when, as if struck by a second\r\n      thought, she resumed it, and so continued to regard me with fixed\r\n      attention for the space of several minutes—for five minutes, at\r\n      the very least, I am sure.\r\n\r\n      This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted very\r\n      general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or\r\n      buzz, among the audience, which for a moment filled me with\r\n      confusion, but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of\r\n      Madame Lalande.\r\n\r\n      Having satisfied her curiosity—if such it was—she dropped the\r\n      glass, and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her\r\n      profile now being turned toward myself, as before. I continued to\r\n      watch her unremittingly, although I was fully conscious of my\r\n      rudeness in so doing. Presently I saw the head slowly and\r\n      slightly change its position; and soon I became convinced that\r\n      the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact,\r\n      attentively regarding myself. It is needless to say what effect\r\n      this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my\r\n      excitable mind.\r\n\r\n      Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, the\r\n      fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended\r\n      her, and while she spoke, I saw distinctly, by the glances of\r\n      both, that the conversation had reference to myself.\r\n\r\n      Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned toward the\r\n      stage, and, for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the\r\n      performance. At the expiration of this period, however, I was\r\n      thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold, for\r\n      the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her side, fully\r\n      confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz of the\r\n      audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous\r\n      composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my\r\n      soul.\r\n\r\n      This extraordinary behavior, by throwing me into a perfect fever\r\n      of excitement—into an absolute delirium of love—served rather to\r\n      embolden than to disconcert me. In the mad intensity of my\r\n      devotion, I forgot everything but the presence and the majestic\r\n      loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze. Watching my\r\n      opportunity, when I thought the audience were fully engaged with\r\n      the opera, I at length caught the eyes of Madame Lalande, and,\r\n      upon the instant, made a slight but unmistakable bow.\r\n\r\n      She blushed very deeply—then averted her eyes—then slowly and\r\n      cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action had\r\n      been noticed—then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her\r\n      side.\r\n\r\n      I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had committed,\r\n      and expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision\r\n      of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably\r\n      through my brain. I was greatly and immediately relieved,\r\n      however, when I saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a\r\n      play-bill, without speaking; but the reader may form some feeble\r\n      conception of my astonishment—of my profound amazement—my\r\n      delirious bewilderment of heart and soul—when, instantly\r\n      afterward, having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her\r\n      bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with\r\n      a faint smile, disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth, made\r\n      two distinct, pointed, and unequivocal affirmative inclinations\r\n      of the head.\r\n\r\n      It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy—upon my\r\n      transport—upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart. If ever man was\r\n      mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at that moment. I\r\n      loved. This was my first love—so I felt it to be. It was love\r\n      supreme—indescribable. It was “love at first sight;” and at first\r\n      sight, too, it had been appreciated and returned.\r\n\r\n      Yes, returned. How and why should I doubt it for an instant. What\r\n      other construction could I possibly put upon such conduct, on the\r\n      part of a lady so beautiful—so wealthy—evidently so\r\n      accomplished—of so high breeding—of so lofty a position in\r\n      society—in every regard so entirely respectable as I felt assured\r\n      was Madame Lalande? Yes, she loved me—she returned the enthusiasm\r\n      of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind—as uncompromising—as\r\n      uncalculating—as abandoned—and as utterly unbounded as my own!\r\n      These delicious fancies and reflections, however, were now\r\n      interrupted by the falling of the drop-curtain. The audience\r\n      arose; and the usual tumult immediately supervened. Quitting\r\n      Talbot abruptly, I made every effort to force my way into closer\r\n      proximity with Madame Lalande. Having failed in this, on account\r\n      of the crowd, I at length gave up the chase, and bent my steps\r\n      homeward; consoling myself for my disappointment in not having\r\n      been able to touch even the hem of her robe, by the reflection\r\n      that I should be introduced by Talbot, in due form, upon the\r\n      morrow.\r\n\r\n      This morrow at last came, that is to say, a day finally dawned\r\n      upon a long and weary night of impatience; and then the hours\r\n      until “one” were snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable. But even\r\n      Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and there came an end to\r\n      this long delay. The clock struck. As the last echo ceased, I\r\n      stepped into B——’s and inquired for Talbot.\r\n\r\n      “Out,” said the footman—Talbot’s own.\r\n\r\n      “Out!” I replied, staggering back half a dozen paces—“let me tell\r\n      you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly impossible and\r\n      impracticable; Mr. Talbot is not out. What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n      “Nothing, sir; only Mr. Talbot is not in, that’s all. He rode\r\n      over to S——, immediately after breakfast, and left word that he\r\n      would not be in town again for a week.”\r\n\r\n      I stood petrified with horror and rage. I endeavored to reply,\r\n      but my tongue refused its office. At length I turned on my heel,\r\n      livid with wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the\r\n      Talbots to the innermost regions of Erebus. It was evident that\r\n      my considerate friend, il fanatico, had quite forgotten his\r\n      appointment with myself—had forgotten it as soon as it was made.\r\n      At no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word. There was no\r\n      help for it; so smothering my vexation as well as I could, I\r\n      strolled moodily up the street, propounding futile inquiries\r\n      about Madame Lalande to every male acquaintance I met. By report\r\n      she was known, I found, to all—to many by sight—but she had been\r\n      in town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who\r\n      claimed her personal acquaintance. These few, being still\r\n      comparatively strangers, could not, or would not, take the\r\n      liberty of introducing me through the formality of a morning\r\n      call. While I stood thus in despair, conversing with a trio of\r\n      friends upon the all-absorbing subject of my heart, it so\r\n      happened that the subject itself passed by.\r\n\r\n      “As I live, there she is!” cried one.\r\n\r\n      “Surprisingly beautiful!” exclaimed a second.\r\n\r\n      “An angel upon earth!” ejaculated a third.\r\n\r\n      I looked; and in an open carriage which approached us, passing\r\n      slowly down the street, sat the enchanting vision of the opera,\r\n      accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her\r\n      box.\r\n\r\n      “Her companion also wears remarkably well,” said the one of my\r\n      trio who had spoken first.\r\n\r\n      “Astonishingly,” said the second; “still quite a brilliant air,\r\n      but art will do wonders. Upon my word, she looks better than she\r\n      did at Paris five years ago. A beautiful woman still;—don’t you\r\n      think so, Froissart?—Simpson, I mean.”\r\n\r\n      “_Still!_” said I, “and why shouldn’t she be? But compared with\r\n      her friend she is as a rush-light to the evening star—a glow-worm\r\n      to Antares.”\r\n\r\n      “Ha! ha! ha!—why, Simpson, you have an astonishing tact at making\r\n      discoveries—original ones, I mean.” And here we separated, while\r\n      one of the trio began humming a gay _vaudeville_, of which I\r\n      caught only the lines—\r\n\r\n      Ninon, Ninon, Ninon à bas—\r\n      A bas Ninon De L’Enclos!\r\n\r\n      During this little scene, however, one thing had served greatly\r\n      to console me, although it fed the passion by which I was\r\n      consumed. As the carriage of Madame Lalande rolled by our group,\r\n      I had observed that she recognized me; and more than this, she\r\n      had blessed me, by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles,\r\n      with no equivocal mark of the recognition.\r\n\r\n      As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all hope of it\r\n      until such time as Talbot should think proper to return from the\r\n      country. In the meantime I perseveringly frequented every\r\n      reputable place of public amusement; and, at length, at the\r\n      theatre, where I first saw her, I had the supreme bliss of\r\n      meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her once again. This\r\n      did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight. Every\r\n      day, in the interim, I had inquired for Talbot at his hotel, and\r\n      every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the\r\n      everlasting “Not come home yet” of his footman.\r\n\r\n      Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a condition\r\n      little short of madness. Madame Lalande, I had been told, was a\r\n      Parisian—had lately arrived from Paris—might she not suddenly\r\n      return?—return before Talbot came back—and might she not be thus\r\n      lost to me forever? The thought was too terrible to bear. Since\r\n      my future happiness was at issue, I resolved to act with a manly\r\n      decision. In a word, upon the breaking up of the play, I traced\r\n      the lady to her residence, noted the address, and the next\r\n      morning sent her a full and elaborate letter, in which I poured\r\n      out my whole heart.\r\n\r\n      I spoke boldly, freely—in a word, I spoke with passion. I\r\n      concealed nothing—nothing even of my weakness. I alluded to the\r\n      romantic circumstances of our first meeting—even to the glances\r\n      which had passed between us. I went so far as to say that I felt\r\n      assured of her love; while I offered this assurance, and my own\r\n      intensity of devotion, as two excuses for my otherwise\r\n      unpardonable conduct. As a third, I spoke of my fear that she\r\n      might quit the city before I could have the opportunity of a\r\n      formal introduction. I concluded the most wildly enthusiastic\r\n      epistle ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly\r\n      circumstances—of my affluence—and with an offer of my heart and\r\n      of my hand.\r\n\r\n      In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply. After what seemed\r\n      the lapse of a century it came.\r\n\r\n      Yes, actually came. Romantic as all this may appear, I really\r\n      received a letter from Madame Lalande—the beautiful, the wealthy,\r\n      the idolized Madame Lalande. Her eyes—her magnificent eyes, had\r\n      not belied her noble heart. Like a true Frenchwoman as she was\r\n      she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reason—the generous\r\n      impulses of her nature—despising the conventional pruderies of\r\n      the world. She had not scorned my proposals. She had not\r\n      sheltered herself in silence. She had not returned my letter\r\n      unopened. She had even sent me, in reply, one penned by her own\r\n      exquisite fingers. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n      “Monsieur Simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle\r\n      tong of his contrée so vell as might. It is only de late dat I am\r\n      arrive, and not yet ave do opportunité for to—l’étudier.\r\n\r\n      “Vid dis apologie for the manière, I vill now say dat,\r\n      hélas!—Monsieur Simpson ave guess but de too true. Need I say de\r\n      more? Hélas! am I not ready speak de too moshe?\r\n\r\n      “EUGENIE LALAND.”\r\n\r\n      This noble-spirited note I kissed a million times, and committed,\r\n      no doubt, on its account, a thousand other extravagances that\r\n      have now escaped my memory. Still Talbot _would_ not return.\r\n      Alas! could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering\r\n      his absence had occasioned his friend, would not his sympathizing\r\n      nature have flown immediately to my relief? Still, however, he\r\n      came _not_. I wrote. He replied. He was detained by urgent\r\n      business—but would shortly return. He begged me not to be\r\n      impatient—to moderate my transports—to read soothing books—to\r\n      drink nothing stronger than Hock—and to bring the consolations of\r\n      philosophy to my aid. The fool! if he could not come himself,\r\n      why, in the name of every thing rational, could he not have\r\n      enclosed me a letter of presentation? I wrote him again,\r\n      entreating him to forward one forthwith. My letter was returned\r\n      by _that_ footman, with the following endorsement in pencil. The\r\n      scoundrel had joined his master in the country:\r\n\r\n      “Left S—— yesterday, for parts unknown—did not say where—or when\r\n      be back—so thought best to return letter, knowing your\r\n      handwriting, and as how you is always, more or less, in a hurry.\r\n\r\n      “Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n      “STUBBS.”\r\n\r\n      After this, it is needless to say, that I devoted to the infernal\r\n      deities both master and valet:—but there was little use in anger,\r\n      and no consolation at all in complaint.\r\n\r\n      But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional audacity.\r\n      Hitherto it had served me well, and I now resolved to make it\r\n      avail me to the end. Besides, after the correspondence which had\r\n      passed between us, what act of mere informality could I commit,\r\n      within bounds, that ought to be regarded as indecorous by Madame\r\n      Lalande? Since the affair of the letter, I had been in the habit\r\n      of watching her house, and thus discovered that, about twilight,\r\n      it was her custom to promenade, attended only by a negro in\r\n      livery, in a public square overlooked by her windows. Here, amid\r\n      the luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the gray gloom of a sweet\r\n      midsummer evening, I observed my opportunity and accosted her.\r\n\r\n      The better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did this with\r\n      the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance. With a\r\n      presence of mind truly Parisian, she took the cue at once, and,\r\n      to greet me, held out the most bewitchingly little of hands. The\r\n      valet at once fell into the rear, and now, with hearts full to\r\n      overflowing, we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love.\r\n\r\n      As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently than she wrote\r\n      it, our conversation was necessarily in French. In this sweet\r\n      tongue, so adapted to passion, I gave loose to the impetuous\r\n      enthusiasm of my nature, and, with all the eloquence I could\r\n      command, besought her to consent to an immediate marriage.\r\n\r\n      At this impatience she smiled. She urged the old story of\r\n      decorum—that bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the\r\n      opportunity for bliss has forever gone by. I had most imprudently\r\n      made it known among my friends, she observed, that I desired her\r\n      acquaintance—thus that I did not possess it—thus, again, there\r\n      was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge\r\n      of each other. And then she adverted, with a blush, to the\r\n      extreme recency of this date. To wed immediately would be\r\n      improper—would be indecorous—would be outre. All this she said\r\n      with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved\r\n      and convinced me. She went even so far as to accuse me,\r\n      laughingly, of rashness—of imprudence. She bade me remember that\r\n      I really even knew not who she was—what were her prospects, her\r\n      connections, her standing in society. She begged me, but with a\r\n      sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my love an\r\n      infatuation—a will o’ the wisp—a fancy or fantasy of the moment—a\r\n      baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of\r\n      the heart. These things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet\r\n      twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us—and then, with\r\n      a gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single\r\n      sweet instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared.\r\n\r\n      I replied as best I could—as only a true lover can. I spoke at\r\n      length, and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion—of her\r\n      exceeding beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration. In\r\n      conclusion, I dwelt, with a convincing energy, upon the perils\r\n      that encompass the course of love—that course of true love that\r\n      never did run smooth—and thus deduced the manifest danger of\r\n      rendering that course unnecessarily long.\r\n\r\n      This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her\r\n      determination. She relented; but there was yet an obstacle, she\r\n      said, which she felt assured I had not properly considered. This\r\n      was a delicate point—for a woman to urge, especially so; in\r\n      mentioning it, she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her\r\n      feelings; still, for me, every sacrifice should be made. She\r\n      alluded to the topic of age. Was I aware—was I fully aware of the\r\n      discrepancy between us? That the age of the husband, should\r\n      surpass by a few years—even by fifteen or twenty—the age of the\r\n      wife, was regarded by the world as admissible, and, indeed, as\r\n      even proper; but she had always entertained the belief that the\r\n      years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the\r\n      husband. A discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too\r\n      frequently, alas! to a life of unhappiness. Now she was aware\r\n      that my own age did not exceed two and twenty; and I, on the\r\n      contrary, perhaps, was not aware that the years of my Eugénie\r\n      extended very considerably beyond that sum.\r\n\r\n      About all this there was a nobility of soul—a dignity of\r\n      candor—which delighted—which enchanted me—which eternally riveted\r\n      my chains. I could scarcely restrain the excessive transport\r\n      which possessed me.\r\n\r\n      “My sweetest Eugénie,” I cried, “what is all this about which you\r\n      are discoursing? Your years surpass in some measure my own. But\r\n      what then? The customs of the world are so many conventional\r\n      follies. To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs\r\n      a year from an hour? I am twenty-two, you say; granted: indeed,\r\n      you may as well call me, at once, twenty-three. Now you yourself,\r\n      my dearest Eugénie, can have numbered no more than—can have\r\n      numbered no more than—no more than—than—than—than—”\r\n\r\n      Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that Madame\r\n      Lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age. But a\r\n      Frenchwoman is seldom direct, and has always, by way of answer to\r\n      an embarrassing query, some little practical reply of her own. In\r\n      the present instance, Eugénie, who for a few moments past had\r\n      seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at length let\r\n      fall upon the grass a miniature, which I immediately picked up\r\n      and presented to her.\r\n\r\n      “Keep it!” she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles. “Keep\r\n      it for my sake—for the sake of her whom it too flatteringly\r\n      represents. Besides, upon the back of the trinket you may\r\n      discover, perhaps, the very information you seem to desire. It is\r\n      now, to be sure, growing rather dark—but you can examine it at\r\n      your leisure in the morning. In the meantime, you shall be my\r\n      escort home to-night. My friends are about holding a little\r\n      musical _levée_. I can promise you, too, some good singing. We\r\n      French are not nearly so punctilious as you Americans, and I\r\n      shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the character of\r\n      an old acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n      With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home. The mansion\r\n      was quite a fine one, and, I believe, furnished in good taste. Of\r\n      this latter point, however, I am scarcely qualified to judge; for\r\n      it was just dark as we arrived; and in American mansions of the\r\n      better sort lights seldom, during the heat of summer, make their\r\n      appearance at this, the most pleasant period of the day. In about\r\n      an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a single shaded solar lamp\r\n      was lit in the principal drawing-room; and this apartment, I\r\n      could thus see, was arranged with unusual good taste and even\r\n      splendor; but two other rooms of the suite, and in which the\r\n      company chiefly assembled, remained, during the whole evening, in\r\n      a very agreeable shadow. This is a well-conceived custom, giving\r\n      the party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which our\r\n      friends over the water could not do better than immediately\r\n      adopt.\r\n\r\n      The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of\r\n      my life. Madame Lalande had not overrated the musical abilities\r\n      of her friends; and the singing I here heard I had never heard\r\n      excelled in any private circle out of Vienna. The instrumental\r\n      performers were many and of superior talents. The vocalists were\r\n      chiefly ladies, and no individual sang less than well. At length,\r\n      upon a peremptory call for “Madame Lalande,” she arose at once,\r\n      without affectation or demur, from the chaise longue upon which\r\n      she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by one or two gentlemen\r\n      and her female friend of the opera, repaired to the piano in the\r\n      main drawing-room. I would have escorted her myself, but felt\r\n      that, under the circumstances of my introduction to the house, I\r\n      had better remain unobserved where I was. I was thus deprived of\r\n      the pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing, her sing.\r\n\r\n      The impression she produced upon the company seemed\r\n      electrical—but the effect upon myself was something even more. I\r\n      know not how adequately to describe it. It arose in part, no\r\n      doubt, from the sentiment of love with which I was imbued; but\r\n      chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the\r\n      singer. It is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or\r\n      recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers. Her\r\n      utterance of the romance in Otello—the tone with which she gave\r\n      the words “Sul mio sasso,” in the Capuletti—is ringing in my\r\n      memory yet. Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous. Her voice\r\n      embraced three complete octaves, extending from the contralto D\r\n      to the D upper soprano, and, though sufficiently powerful to have\r\n      filled the San Carlos, executed, with the minutest precision,\r\n      every difficulty of vocal composition—ascending and descending\r\n      scales, cadences, or fiorituri. In the final of the Somnambula,\r\n      she brought about a most remarkable effect at the words:\r\n\r\n     Ah! non guinge uman pensiero\r\n     Al contento ond ’io son piena.\r\n\r\n      Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original phrase\r\n      of Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to the tenor G, when,\r\n      by a rapid transition, she struck the G above the treble stave,\r\n      springing over an interval of two octaves.\r\n\r\n      Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal\r\n      execution, she resumed her seat by my side; when I expressed to\r\n      her, in terms of the deepest enthusiasm, my delight at her\r\n      performance. Of my surprise I said nothing, and yet was I most\r\n      unfeignedly surprised; for a certain feebleness, or rather a\r\n      certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation,\r\n      had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing, she would not\r\n      acquit herself with any remarkable ability.\r\n\r\n      Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and\r\n      totally unreserved. She made me relate many of the earlier\r\n      passages of my life, and listened with breathless attention to\r\n      every word of the narrative. I concealed nothing—felt that I had\r\n      a right to conceal nothing—from her confiding affection.\r\n      Encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age, I\r\n      entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of my\r\n      many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and\r\n      even of those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in\r\n      demanding so much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an\r\n      evidence of love. I touched upon my college indiscretions—upon my\r\n      extravagances—upon my carousals—upon my debts—upon my\r\n      flirtations. I even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic\r\n      cough with which, at one time, I had been troubled—of a chronic\r\n      rheumatism—of a twinge of hereditary gout—and, in conclusion, of\r\n      the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully\r\n      concealed, weakness of my eyes.\r\n\r\n      “Upon this latter point,” said Madame Lalande, laughingly, “you\r\n      have been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for,\r\n      without the confession, I take it for granted that no one would\r\n      have accused you of the crime. By the by,” she continued, “have\r\n      you any recollection—” and here I fancied that a blush, even\r\n      through the gloom of the apartment, became distinctly visible\r\n      upon her cheek—“have you any recollection, _mon cher ami_, of\r\n      this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my neck?”\r\n\r\n      As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double\r\n      eye-glass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the\r\n      opera.\r\n\r\n      “Full well—alas! do I remember it,” I exclaimed, pressing\r\n      passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my\r\n      inspection. They formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly\r\n      chased and filigreed, and gleaming with jewels, which, even in\r\n      the deficient light, I could not help perceiving were of high\r\n      value.\r\n\r\n      “_Eh bien! mon ami_,” she resumed with a certain _empressment_ of\r\n      manner that rather surprised me—“_Eh bien! mon ami_, you have\r\n      earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to\r\n      denominate priceless. You have demanded of me my hand upon the\r\n      morrow. Should I yield to your entreaties—and, I may add, to the\r\n      pleadings of my own bosom—would I not be entitled to demand of\r\n      you a very—a very little boon in return?”\r\n\r\n      “Name it!” I exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon\r\n      us the observation of the company, and restrained by their\r\n      presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet.\r\n      “Name it, my beloved, my Eugénie, my own!—name it!—but, alas! it\r\n      is already yielded ere named.”\r\n\r\n      “You shall conquer, then, _mon ami_,” said she, “for the sake of\r\n      the Eugénie whom you love, this little weakness which you have at\r\n      last confessed—this weakness more moral than physical—and which,\r\n      let me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your real\r\n      nature—so inconsistent with the candor of your usual\r\n      character—and which, if permitted further control, will assuredly\r\n      involve you, sooner or later, in some very disagreeable scrape.\r\n      You shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation which leads you,\r\n      as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied denial of\r\n      your infirmity of vision. For, this infirmity you virtually deny,\r\n      in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief. You\r\n      will understand me to say, then, that I wish you to wear\r\n      spectacles;—ah, hush!—you have already consented to wear them,\r\n      for my sake. You shall accept the little toy which I now hold in\r\n      my hand, and which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is\r\n      really of no very immense value as a gem. You perceive that, by a\r\n      trifling modification thus—or thus—it can be adapted to the eyes\r\n      in the form of spectacles, or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an\r\n      eye-glass. It is in the former mode, however, and habitually,\r\n      that you have already consented to wear it for my sake.”\r\n\r\n      This request—must I confess it?—confused me in no little degree.\r\n      But the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation,\r\n      of course, a matter altogether out of the question.\r\n\r\n      “It is done!” I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I could\r\n      muster at the moment. “It is done—it is most cheerfully agreed. I\r\n      sacrifice every feeling for your sake. To-night I wear this dear\r\n      eye-glass, as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the\r\n      earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of\r\n      calling you wife, I will place it upon my—upon my nose,—and there\r\n      wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less\r\n      fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which\r\n      you desire.”\r\n\r\n      Our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements\r\n      for the morrow. Talbot, I learned from my betrothed, had just\r\n      arrived in town. I was to see him at once, and procure a\r\n      carriage. The _soirée_ would scarcely break up before two; and by\r\n      this hour the vehicle was to be at the door; when, in the\r\n      confusion occasioned by the departure of the company, Madame L.\r\n      could easily enter it unobserved. We were then to call at the\r\n      house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be married,\r\n      drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East; leaving the\r\n      fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the\r\n      matter it thought best.\r\n\r\n      Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and went in\r\n      search of Talbot, but, on the way, I could not refrain from\r\n      stepping into a hotel, for the purpose of inspecting the\r\n      miniature; and this I did by the powerful aid of the glasses. The\r\n      countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one! Those large\r\n      luminous eyes!—that proud Grecian nose!—those dark luxuriant\r\n      curls!—“Ah!” said I, exultingly to myself, “this is indeed the\r\n      speaking image of my beloved!” I turned the reverse, and\r\n      discovered the words—“Eugénie Lalande—aged twenty-seven years and\r\n      seven months.”\r\n\r\n      I found Talbot at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint him\r\n      with my good fortune. He professed excessive astonishment, of\r\n      course, but congratulated me most cordially, and proffered every\r\n      assistance in his power. In a word, we carried out our\r\n      arrangement to the letter, and, at two in the morning, just ten\r\n      minutes after the ceremony, I found myself in a close carriage\r\n      with Madame Lalande—with Mrs. Simpson, I should say—and driving\r\n      at a great rate out of town, in a direction northeast by north,\r\n      half-north.\r\n\r\n      It had been determined for us by Talbot, that, as we were to be\r\n      up all night, we should make our first stop at C——, a village\r\n      about twenty miles from the city, and there get an early\r\n      breakfast and some repose, before proceeding upon our route. At\r\n      four precisely, therefore, the carriage drew up at the door of\r\n      the principal inn. I handed my adored wife out, and ordered\r\n      breakfast forthwith. In the meantime we were shown into a small\r\n      parlor, and sat down.\r\n\r\n      It was now nearly if not altogether daylight; and, as I gazed,\r\n      enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular idea came, all\r\n      at once, into my head, that this was really the very first moment\r\n      since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of Madame\r\n      Lalande, that I had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness\r\n      by daylight at all.\r\n\r\n      “And now, _mon ami_,” said she, taking my hand, and so\r\n      interrupting this train of reflection, “and now, _mon cher ami_,\r\n      since we are indissolubly one—since I have yielded to your\r\n      passionate entreaties, and performed my portion of our\r\n      agreement—I presume you have not forgotten that you also have a\r\n      little favor to bestow—a little promise which it is your\r\n      intention to keep. Ah! let me see! Let me remember! Yes; full\r\n      easily do I call to mind the precise words of the dear promise\r\n      you made to Eugénie last night. Listen! You spoke thus: ‘It is\r\n      done!—it is most cheerfully agreed! I sacrifice every feeling for\r\n      your sake. To-night I wear this dear eye-glass as an eye-glass,\r\n      and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning\r\n      which gives me the privilege of calling you wife, I will place it\r\n      upon my—upon my nose,—and there wear it ever afterward, in the\r\n      less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more\r\n      serviceable, form which you desire.’ These were the exact words,\r\n      my beloved husband, were they not?”\r\n\r\n      “They were,” I said; “you have an excellent memory; and\r\n      assuredly, my beautiful Eugénie, there is no disposition on my\r\n      part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply.\r\n      See! Behold! they are becoming—rather—are they not?” And here,\r\n      having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles, I\r\n      applied them gingerly in their proper position; while Madame\r\n      Simpson, adjusting her cap, and folding her arms, sat bolt\r\n      upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim, and indeed,\r\n      in a somewhat undignified position.\r\n\r\n      “Goodness gracious me!” I exclaimed, almost at the very instant\r\n      that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nose—“_My!_\r\n      goodness gracious me!—why, what can be the matter with these\r\n      glasses?” and taking them quickly off, I wiped them carefully\r\n      with a silk handkerchief, and adjusted them again.\r\n\r\n      But if, in the first instance, there had occurred something which\r\n      occasioned me surprise, in the second, this surprise became\r\n      elevated into astonishment; and this astonishment was\r\n      profound—was extreme—indeed I may say it was horrific. What, in\r\n      the name of everything hideous, did this mean? Could I believe my\r\n      eyes?—could I?—that was the question. Was that—was that—was that\r\n      rouge? And were those—and were those—were those wrinkles, upon\r\n      the visage of Eugénie Lalande? And oh! Jupiter, and every one of\r\n      the gods and goddesses, little and big!—what—what—what—_what_ had\r\n      become of her teeth? I dashed the spectacles violently to the\r\n      ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood erect in the middle of the\r\n      floor, confronting Mrs. Simpson, with my arms set a-kimbo, and\r\n      grinning and foaming, but, at the same time, utterly speechless\r\n      with terror and with rage.\r\n\r\n      Now I have already said that Madame Eugénie Lalande—that is to\r\n      say, Simpson—spoke the English language but very little better\r\n      than she wrote it, and for this reason she very properly never\r\n      attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions. But rage will\r\n      carry a lady to any extreme; and in the present care it carried\r\n      Mrs. Simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to\r\n      hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether\r\n      understand.\r\n\r\n      “Vell, Monsieur,” said she, after surveying me, in great apparent\r\n      astonishment, for some moments—“Vell, Monsieur?—and vat den?—vat\r\n      de matter now? Is it de dance of de Saint itusse dat you ave? If\r\n      not like me, vat for vy buy de pig in the poke?”\r\n\r\n      “You wretch!” said I, catching my breath—“you—you—you villainous\r\n      old hag!”\r\n\r\n      “Ag?—ole?—me not so ver ole, after all! Me not one single day\r\n      more dan de eighty-doo.”\r\n\r\n      “Eighty-two!” I ejaculated, staggering to the wall—“eighty-two\r\n      hundred thousand baboons! The miniature said twenty-seven years\r\n      and seven months!”\r\n\r\n      “To be sure!—dat is so!—ver true! but den de portraite has been\r\n      take for dese fifty-five year. Ven I go marry my segonde usbande,\r\n      Monsieur Lalande, at dat time I had de portraite take for my\r\n      daughter by my first usbande, Monsieur Moissart!”\r\n\r\n      “Moissart!” said I.\r\n\r\n      “Yes, Moissart,” said she, mimicking my pronunciation, which, to\r\n      speak the truth, was none of the best,—“and vat den? Vat you know\r\n      about de Moissart?”\r\n\r\n      “Nothing, you old fright!—I know nothing about him at all; only I\r\n      had an ancestor of that name, once upon a time.”\r\n\r\n      “Dat name! and vat you ave for say to dat name? ’Tis ver _goot_\r\n      name; and so is Voissart—dat is ver goot name too. My daughter,\r\n      Mademoiselle Moissart, she marry von Monsieur Voissart,—and de\r\n      name is bot _ver_ respectable name.”\r\n\r\n      “Moissart?” I exclaimed, “and Voissart! Why, what is it you\r\n      mean?”\r\n\r\n      “Vat I mean?—I mean Moissart and Voissart; and for de matter of\r\n      dat, I mean Croissart and Froissart, too, if I only tink proper\r\n      to mean it. My daughter’s daughter, Mademoiselle Voissart, she\r\n      marry von Monsieur Croissart, and den again, my daughter’s grande\r\n      daughter, Mademoiselle Croissart, she marry von Monsieur\r\n      Froissart; and I suppose you say dat _dat_ is not von _ver_\r\n      respectaable name.”\r\n\r\n      “Froissart!” said I, beginning to faint, “why, surely you don’t\r\n      say Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart?”\r\n\r\n      “Yes,” she replied, leaning fully back in her chair, and\r\n      stretching out her lower limbs at great length; “yes, Moissart,\r\n      and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart. But Monsieur\r\n      Froissart, he vas von _ver_ big vat you call fool—he vas von ver\r\n      great big donce like yourself—for he lef _la belle France_ for\r\n      come to dis stupide Amérique—and ven he get here he went and ave\r\n      von _ver_ stupid, von _ver, ver_ stupide sonn, so I hear, dough I\r\n      not yet av ad de plaisir to meet vid him—neither me nor my\r\n      companion, de Madame Stéphanie Lalande. He is name de Napoleon\r\n      Bonaparte Froissart, and I suppose you say dat _dat_, too, is not\r\n      von ver respectable name.”\r\n\r\n      Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the effect of\r\n      working up Mrs. Simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed;\r\n      and as she made an end of it, with great labor, she jumped up\r\n      from her chair like somebody bewitched, dropping upon the floor\r\n      an entire universe of bustle as she jumped. Once upon her feet,\r\n      she gnashed her gums, brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves,\r\n      shook her fist in my face, and concluded the performance by\r\n      tearing the cap from her head, and with it an immense wig of the\r\n      most valuable and beautiful black hair, the whole of which she\r\n      dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there trammpled and\r\n      danced a fandango upon it, in an absolute ecstasy and agony of\r\n      rage.\r\n\r\n      Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated.\r\n      “Moissart and Voissart!” I repeated, thoughtfully, as she cut one\r\n      of her pigeon-wings, and “Croissart and Froissart!” as she\r\n      completed another—“Moissart and Voissart and Croissart and\r\n      Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart!—why, you ineffable old serpent,\r\n      that’s me—that’s me—d’ye hear? that’s me”—here I screamed at the\r\n      top of my voice—“that’s me-e-e! I am Napoleon Bonaparte\r\n      Froissart! and if I havn’t married my great, great, grandmother,\r\n      I wish I may be everlastingly confounded!”\r\n\r\n      Madame Eugénie Lalande, _quasi_ Simpson—formerly Moissart—was, in\r\n      sober fact, my great, great, grandmother. In her youth she had\r\n      been beautiful, and even at eighty-two, retained the majestic\r\n      height, the sculptural contour of head, the fine eyes and the\r\n      Grecian nose of her girlhood. By the aid of these, of\r\n      pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair, false teeth, and false\r\n      tournure, as well as of the most skilful modistes of Paris, she\r\n      contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties _en\r\n      peu passées_ of the French metropolis. In this respect, indeed,\r\n      she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the\r\n      celebrated Ninon De L’Enclos.\r\n\r\n      She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second time, a\r\n      widow without children, she bethought herself of my existence in\r\n      America, and for the purpose of making me her heir, paid a visit\r\n      to the United States, in company with a distant and exceedingly\r\n      lovely relative of her second husband’s—a Madame Stéphanie\r\n      Lalande.\r\n\r\n      At the opera, my great, great, grandmother’s attention was\r\n      arrested by my notice; and, upon surveying me through her\r\n      eye-glass, she was struck with a certain family resemblance to\r\n      herself. Thus interested, and knowing that the heir she sought\r\n      was actually in the city, she made inquiries of her party\r\n      respecting me. The gentleman who attended her knew my person, and\r\n      told her who I was. The information thus obtained induced her to\r\n      renew her scrutiny; and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened\r\n      me that I behaved in the absurd manner already detailed. She\r\n      returned my bow, however, under the impression that, by some odd\r\n      accident, I had discovered her identity. When, deceived by my\r\n      weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect to the\r\n      age and charms of the strange lady, I demanded so\r\n      enthusiastically of Talbot who she was, he concluded that I meant\r\n      the younger beauty, as a matter of course, and so informed me,\r\n      with perfect truth, that she was “the celebrated widow, Madame\r\n      Lalande.”\r\n\r\n      In the street, next morning, my great, great, grandmother\r\n      encountered Talbot, an old Parisian acquaintance; and the\r\n      conversation, very naturally turned upon myself. My deficiencies\r\n      of vision were then explained; for these were notorious, although\r\n      I was entirely ignorant of their notoriety, and my good old\r\n      relative discovered, much to her chagrin, that she had been\r\n      deceived in supposing me aware of her identity, and that I had\r\n      been merely making a fool of myself in making open love, in a\r\n      theatre, to an old woman unknown. By way of punishing me for this\r\n      imprudence, she concocted with Talbot a plot. He purposely kept\r\n      out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction. My street\r\n      inquiries about “the lovely widow, Madame Lalande,” were supposed\r\n      to refer to the younger lady, of course, and thus the\r\n      conversation with the three gentlemen whom I encountered shortly\r\n      after leaving Talbot’s hotel will be easily explained, as also\r\n      their allusion to Ninon De L’Enclos. I had no opportunity of\r\n      seeing Madame Lalande closely during daylight; and, at her\r\n      musical _soirée_, my silly weakness in refusing the aid of\r\n      glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her\r\n      age. When “Madame Lalande” was called upon to sing, the younger\r\n      lady was intended; and it was she who arose to obey the call; my\r\n      great, great, grandmother, to further the deception, arising at\r\n      the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main\r\n      drawing-room. Had I decided upon escorting her thither, it had\r\n      been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where I\r\n      was; but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary. The\r\n      songs which I so much admired, and which so confirmed my\r\n      impression of the youth of my mistress, were executed by Madame\r\n      Stéphanie Lalande. The eyeglass was presented by way of adding a\r\n      reproof to the hoax—a sting to the epigram of the deception. Its\r\n      presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon\r\n      affectation with which I was so especially edified. It is almost\r\n      superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument, as worn by\r\n      the old lady, had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted\r\n      to my years. They suited me, in fact, to a T.\r\n\r\n      The clergyman, who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot, was a\r\n      boon companion of Talbot’s, and no priest. He was an excellent\r\n      “whip,” however; and having doffed his cassock to put on a\r\n      great-coat, he drove the hack which conveyed the “happy couple”\r\n      out of town. Talbot took a seat at his side. The two scoundrels\r\n      were thus “in at the death,” and through a half-open window of\r\n      the back parlor of the inn, amused themselves in grinning at the\r\n      _dénouement_ of the drama. I believe I shall be forced to call\r\n      them both out.\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless, I am _not_ the husband of my great, great,\r\n      grandmother; and this is a reflection which affords me infinite\r\n      relief;—but I _am_ the husband of Madame Lalande—of Madame\r\n      Stéphanie Lalande—with whom my good old relative, besides making\r\n      me her sole heir when she dies—if she ever does—has been at the\r\n      trouble of concocting me a match. In conclusion: I am done\r\n      forever with _billets doux_, and am never to be met without\r\n      SPECTACLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKING PEST\r\n\r\n\r\n      A Tale Containing an Allegory.\r\n\r\n     The gods do bear and will allow in kings\r\n     The things which they abhor in rascal routes.\r\n                    —_Buckhurst’s Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex._\r\n\r\n      About twelve o’clock, one night in the month of October, and\r\n      during the chivalrous reign of the third Edward, two seamen\r\n      belonging to the crew of the _>Free and Easy_, a trading schooner\r\n      plying between Sluys and the Thames, and then at anchor in that\r\n      river, were much astonished to find themselves seated in the\r\n      tap-room of an ale-house in the parish of St. Andrews,\r\n      London—which ale-house bore for sign the portraiture of a “Jolly\r\n      Tar.”\r\n\r\n      The room, although ill-contrived, smoke-blackened, low-pitched,\r\n      and in every other respect agreeing with the general character of\r\n      such places at the period—was, nevertheless, in the opinion of\r\n      the grotesque groups scattered here and there within it,\r\n      sufficiently well adapted to its purpose.\r\n\r\n      Of these groups our two seamen formed, I think, the most\r\n      interesting, if not the most conspicuous.\r\n\r\n      The one who appeared to be the elder, and whom his companion\r\n      addressed by the characteristic appellation of “Legs,” was at the\r\n      same time much the taller of the two. He might have measured six\r\n      feet and a half, and an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to\r\n      have been the necessary consequence of an altitude so enormous.\r\n      Superfluities in height were, however, more than accounted for by\r\n      deficiencies in other respects. He was exceedingly thin; and\r\n      might, as his associates asserted, have answered, when drunk, for\r\n      a pennant at the mast-head, or, when sober, have served for a\r\n      jib-boom. But these jests, and others of a similar nature, had\r\n      evidently produced, at no time, any effect upon the cachinnatory\r\n      muscles of the tar. With high cheek-bones, a large hawk-nose,\r\n      retreating chin, fallen under-jaw, and huge protruding white\r\n      eyes, the expression of his countenance, although tinged with a\r\n      species of dogged indifference to matters and things in general,\r\n      was not the less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts\r\n      at imitation or description.\r\n\r\n      The younger seaman was, in all outward appearance, the converse\r\n      of his companion. His stature could not have exceeded four feet.\r\n      A pair of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat, unwieldy figure,\r\n      while his unusually short and thick arms, with no ordinary fists\r\n      at their extremities, swung off dangling from his sides like the\r\n      fins of a sea-turtle. Small eyes, of no particular color,\r\n      twinkled far back in his head. His nose remained buried in the\r\n      mass of flesh which enveloped his round, full, and purple face;\r\n      and his thick upper-lip rested upon the still thicker one beneath\r\n      with an air of complacent self-satisfaction, much heightened by\r\n      the owner’s habit of licking them at intervals. He evidently\r\n      regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling half-wondrous,\r\n      half-quizzical; and stared up occasionally in his face as the red\r\n      setting sun stares up at the crags of Ben Nevis.\r\n\r\n      Various and eventful, however, had been the peregrinations of the\r\n      worthy couple in and about the different tap-houses of the\r\n      neighbourhood during the earlier hours of the night. Funds even\r\n      the most ample, are not always everlasting: and it was with empty\r\n      pockets our friends had ventured upon the present hostelrie.\r\n\r\n      At the precise period, then, when this history properly\r\n      commences, Legs, and his fellow Hugh Tarpaulin, sat, each with\r\n      both elbows resting upon the large oaken table in the middle of\r\n      the floor, and with a hand upon either cheek. They were eyeing,\r\n      from behind a huge flagon of unpaid-for “humming-stuff,” the\r\n      portentous words, “No Chalk,” which to their indignation and\r\n      astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of that very\r\n      mineral whose presence they purported to deny. Not that the gift\r\n      of decyphering written characters—a gift among the commonalty of\r\n      that day considered little less cabalistical than the art of\r\n      inditing—could, in strict justice, have been laid to the charge\r\n      of either disciple of the sea; but there was, to say the truth, a\r\n      certain twist in the formation of the letters—an indescribable\r\n      lee-lurch about the whole—which foreboded, in the opinion of both\r\n      seamen, a long run of dirty weather; and determined them at once,\r\n      in the allegorical words of Legs himself, to “pump ship, clew up\r\n      all sail, and scud before the wind.”\r\n\r\n      Having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale, and\r\n      looped up the points of their short doublets, they finally made a\r\n      bolt for the street. Although Tarpaulin rolled twice into the\r\n      fire-place, mistaking it for the door, yet their escape was at\r\n      length happily effected—and half after twelve o’clock found our\r\n      heroes ripe for mischief, and running for life down a dark alley\r\n      in the direction of St. Andrew’s Stair, hotly pursued by the\r\n      landlady of the “Jolly Tar.”\r\n\r\n      At the epoch of this eventful tale, and periodically, for many\r\n      years before and after, all England, but more especially the\r\n      metropolis, resounded with the fearful cry of “Plague!” The city\r\n      was in a great measure depopulated—and in those horrible regions,\r\n      in the vicinity of the Thames, where amid the dark, narrow, and\r\n      filthy lanes and alleys, the Demon of Disease was supposed to\r\n      have had his nativity, Awe, Terror, and Superstition were alone\r\n      to be found stalking abroad.\r\n\r\n      By authority of the king such districts were placed under ban,\r\n      and all persons forbidden, under pain of death, to intrude upon\r\n      their dismal solitude. Yet neither the mandate of the monarch,\r\n      nor the huge barriers erected at the entrances of the streets,\r\n      nor the prospect of that loathsome death which, with almost\r\n      absolute certainty, overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could\r\n      deter from the adventure, prevented the unfurnished and\r\n      untenanted dwellings from being stripped, by the hand of nightly\r\n      rapine, of every article, such as iron, brass, or lead-work,\r\n      which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account.\r\n\r\n      Above all, it was usually found, upon the annual winter opening\r\n      of the barriers, that locks, bolts, and secret cellars, had\r\n      proved but slender protection to those rich stores of wines and\r\n      liquors which, in consideration of the risk and trouble of\r\n      removal, many of the numerous dealers having shops in the\r\n      neighbourhood had consented to trust, during the period of exile,\r\n      to so insufficient a security.\r\n\r\n      But there were very few of the terror-stricken people who\r\n      attributed these doings to the agency of human hands.\r\n      Pest-spirits, plague-goblins, and fever-demons, were the popular\r\n      imps of mischief; and tales so blood-chilling were hourly told,\r\n      that the whole mass of forbidden buildings was, at length,\r\n      enveloped in terror as in a shroud, and the plunderer himself was\r\n      often scared away by the horrors his own depreciations had\r\n      created; leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited district\r\n      to gloom, silence, pestilence, and death.\r\n\r\n      It was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned, and\r\n      which indicated the region beyond to be under the Pest-ban, that,\r\n      in scrambling down an alley, Legs and the worthy Hugh Tarpaulin\r\n      found their progress suddenly impeded. To return was out of the\r\n      question, and no time was to be lost, as their pursuers were\r\n      close upon their heels. With thorough-bred seamen to clamber up\r\n      the roughly fashioned plank-work was a trifle; and, maddened with\r\n      the twofold excitement of exercise and liquor, they leaped\r\n      unhesitatingly down within the enclosure, and holding on their\r\n      drunken course with shouts and yellings, were soon bewildered in\r\n      its noisome and intricate recesses.\r\n\r\n      Had they not, indeed, been intoxicated beyond moral sense, their\r\n      reeling footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their\r\n      situation. The air was cold and misty. The paving-stones,\r\n      loosened from their beds, lay in wild disorder amid the tall,\r\n      rank grass, which sprang up around the feet and ankles. Fallen\r\n      houses choked up the streets. The most fetid and poisonous smells\r\n      everywhere prevailed;—and by the aid of that ghastly light which,\r\n      even at midnight, never fails to emanate from a vapory and\r\n      pestilential atmosphere, might be discerned lying in the by-paths\r\n      and alleys, or rotting in the windowless habitations, the carcass\r\n      of many a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague\r\n      in the very perpetration of his robbery.\r\n\r\n      But it lay not in the power of images, or sensations, or\r\n      impediments such as these, to stay the course of men who,\r\n      naturally brave, and at that time especially, brimful of courage\r\n      and of “humming-stuff,” would have reeled, as straight as their\r\n      condition might have permitted, undauntedly into the very jaws of\r\n      Death. Onward—still onward stalked the grim Legs, making the\r\n      desolate solemnity echo and re-echo with yells like the terrific\r\n      war-whoop of the Indian; and onward, still onward rolled the\r\n      dumpy Tarpaulin, hanging on to the doublet of his more active\r\n      companion, and far surpassing the latter’s most strenuous\r\n      exertions in the way of vocal music, by bull-roarings _in basso_,\r\n      from the profundity of his stentorian lungs.\r\n\r\n      They had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence.\r\n      Their way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more\r\n      horrible—the paths more narrow and more intricate. Huge stones\r\n      and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them,\r\n      gave evidence, by their sullen and heavy descent, of the vast\r\n      height of the surrounding houses; and while actual exertion\r\n      became necessary to force a passage through frequent heaps of\r\n      rubbish, it was by no means seldom that the hand fell upon a\r\n      skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse.\r\n\r\n      Suddenly, as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall\r\n      and ghastly-looking building, a yell more than usually shrill\r\n      from the throat of the excited Legs, was replied to from within,\r\n      in a rapid succession of wild, laughter-like, and fiendish\r\n      shrieks. Nothing daunted at sounds which, of such a nature, at\r\n      such a time, and in such a place, might have curdled the very\r\n      blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire, the drunken couple\r\n      rushed headlong against the door, burst it open, and staggered\r\n      into the midst of things with a volley of curses.\r\n\r\n      The room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop\r\n      of an undertaker; but an open trap-door, in a corner of the floor\r\n      near the entrance, looked down upon a long range of wine-cellars,\r\n      whose depths the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed\r\n      to be well stored with their appropriate contents. In the middle\r\n      of the room stood a table—in the centre of which again arose a\r\n      huge tub of what appeared to be punch. Bottles of various wines\r\n      and cordials, together with jugs, pitchers, and flagons of every\r\n      shape and quality, were scattered profusely upon the board.\r\n      Around it, upon coffin-tressels, was seated a company of six.\r\n      This company I will endeavor to delineate one by one.\r\n\r\n      Fronting the entrance, and elevated a little above his\r\n      companions, sat a personage who appeared to be the president of\r\n      the table. His stature was gaunt and tall, and Legs was\r\n      confounded to behold in him a figure more emaciated than himself.\r\n      His face was as yellow as saffron—but no feature excepting one\r\n      alone, was sufficiently marked to merit a particular description.\r\n      This one consisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously\r\n      lofty, as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh\r\n      superadded upon the natural head. His mouth was puckered and\r\n      dimpled into an expression of ghastly affability, and his eyes,\r\n      as indeed the eyes of all at table, were glazed over with the\r\n      fumes of intoxication. This gentleman was clothed from head to\r\n      foot in a richly-embroidered black silk-velvet pall, wrapped\r\n      negligently around his form after the fashion of a Spanish cloak.\r\n      His head was stuck full of sable hearse-plumes, which he nodded\r\n      to and fro with a jaunty and knowing air; and, in his right hand,\r\n      he held a huge human thigh-bone, with which he appeared to have\r\n      been just knocking down some member of the company for a song.\r\n\r\n      Opposite him, and with her back to the door, was a lady of no\r\n      whit the less extraordinary character. Although quite as tall as\r\n      the person just described, she had no right to complain of his\r\n      unnatural emaciation. She was evidently in the last stage of a\r\n      dropsy; and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon\r\n      of October beer which stood, with the head driven in, close by\r\n      her side, in a corner of the chamber. Her face was exceedingly\r\n      round, red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or rather want of\r\n      peculiarity, attached itself to her countenance, which I before\r\n      mentioned in the case of the president—that is to say, only one\r\n      feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a\r\n      separate characterization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately\r\n      observed that the same remark might have applied to each\r\n      individual person of the party; every one of whom seemed to\r\n      possess a monopoly of some particular portion of physiognomy.\r\n      With the lady in question this portion proved to be the mouth.\r\n      Commencing at the right ear, it swept with a terrific chasm to\r\n      the left—the short pendants which she wore in either auricle\r\n      continually bobbing into the aperture. She made, however, every\r\n      exertion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified, in a dress\r\n      consisting of a newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close\r\n      under her chin, with a crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin.\r\n\r\n      At her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared\r\n      to patronise. This delicate little creature, in the trembling of\r\n      her wasted fingers, in the livid hue of her lips, and in the\r\n      slight hectic spot which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion,\r\n      gave evident indications of a galloping consumption. An air of\r\n      extreme _haut ton_, however, pervaded her whole appearance; she\r\n      wore in a graceful and _dégagé_ manner, a large and beautiful\r\n      winding-sheet of the finest India lawn; her hair hung in ringlets\r\n      over her neck; a soft smile played about her mouth; but her nose,\r\n      extremely long, thin, sinuous, flexible and pimpled, hung down\r\n      far below her under lip, and in spite of the delicate manner in\r\n      which she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her\r\n      tongue, gave to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression.\r\n\r\n      Over against her, and upon the left of the dropsical lady, was\r\n      seated a little puffy, wheezing, and gouty old man, whose cheeks\r\n      reposed upon the shoulders of their owner, like two huge bladders\r\n      of Oporto wine. With his arms folded, and with one bandaged leg\r\n      deposited upon the table, he seemed to think himself entitled to\r\n      some consideration. He evidently prided himself much upon every\r\n      inch of his personal appearance, but took more especial delight\r\n      in calling attention to his gaudy-colored surtout. This, to say\r\n      the truth, must have cost him no little money, and was made to\r\n      fit him exceedingly well—being fashioned from one of the\r\n      curiously embroidered silken covers appertaining to those\r\n      glorious escutcheons which, in England and elsewhere, are\r\n      customarily hung up, in some conspicuous place, upon the\r\n      dwellings of departed aristocracy.\r\n\r\n      Next to him, and at the right hand of the president, was a\r\n      gentleman in long white hose and cotton drawers. His frame shook,\r\n      in a ridiculous manner, with a fit of what Tarpaulin called “the\r\n      horrors.” His jaws, which had been newly shaved, were tightly\r\n      tied up by a bandage of muslin; and his arms being fastened in a\r\n      similar way at the wrists, prevented him from helping himself too\r\n      freely to the liquors upon the table; a precaution rendered\r\n      necessary, in the opinion of Legs, by the peculiarly sottish and\r\n      wine-bibbing cast of his visage. A pair of prodigious ears,\r\n      nevertheless, which it was no doubt found impossible to confine,\r\n      towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment, and were\r\n      occasionally pricked up in a spasm, at the sound of the drawing\r\n      of a cork.\r\n\r\n      Fronting him, sixthly and lastly, was situated a singularly\r\n      stiff-looking personage, who, being afflicted with paralysis,\r\n      must, to speak seriously, have felt very ill at ease in his\r\n      unaccommodating habiliments. He was habited, somewhat uniquely,\r\n      in a new and handsome mahogany coffin. Its top or head-piece\r\n      pressed upon the skull of the wearer, and extended over it in the\r\n      fashion of a hood, giving to the entire face an air of\r\n      indescribable interest. Arm-holes had been cut in the sides, for\r\n      the sake not more of elegance than of convenience; but the dress,\r\n      nevertheless, prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as\r\n      his associates; and as he lay reclining against his tressel, at\r\n      an angle of forty-five degrees, a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled\r\n      up their awful whites towards the ceiling in absolute amazement\r\n      at their own enormity.\r\n\r\n      Before each of the party lay a portion of a skull, which was used\r\n      as a drinking cup. Overhead was suspended a human skeleton, by\r\n      means of a rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring\r\n      in the ceiling. The other limb, confined by no such fetter, stuck\r\n      off from the body at right angles, causing the whole loose and\r\n      rattling frame to dangle and twirl about at the caprice of every\r\n      occasional puff of wind which found its way into the apartment.\r\n      In the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited\r\n      charcoal, which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire\r\n      scene; while coffins, and other wares appertaining to the shop of\r\n      an undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and against\r\n      the windows, preventing any ray from escaping into the street.\r\n\r\n      At sight of this extraordinary assembly, and of their still more\r\n      extraordinary paraphernalia, our two seamen did not conduct\r\n      themselves with that degree of decorum which might have been\r\n      expected. Legs, leaning against the wall near which he happened\r\n      to be standing, dropped his lower jaw still lower than usual, and\r\n      spread open his eyes to their fullest extent: while Hugh\r\n      Tarpaulin, stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a level\r\n      with the table, and spreading out a palm upon either knee, burst\r\n      into a long, loud, and obstreperous roar of very ill-timed and\r\n      immoderate laughter.\r\n\r\n      Without, however, taking offence at behaviour so excessively\r\n      rude, the tall president smiled very graciously upon the\r\n      intruders—nodded to them in a dignified manner with his head of\r\n      sable plumes—and, arising, took each by an arm, and led him to a\r\n      seat which some others of the company had placed in the meantime\r\n      for his accommodation. Legs to all this offered not the slightest\r\n      resistance, but sat down as he was directed; while the gallant\r\n      Hugh, removing his coffin tressel from its station near the head\r\n      of the table, to the vicinity of the little consumptive lady in\r\n      the winding sheet, plumped down by her side in high glee, and\r\n      pouring out a skull of red wine, quaffed it to their better\r\n      acquaintance. But at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the\r\n      coffin seemed exceedingly nettled; and serious consequences might\r\n      have ensued, had not the president, rapping upon the table with\r\n      his truncheon, diverted the attention of all present to the\r\n      following speech:\r\n\r\n      “It becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion—”\r\n\r\n      “Avast there!” interrupted Legs, looking very serious, “avast\r\n      there a bit, I say, and tell us who the devil ye all are, and\r\n      what business ye have here, rigged off like the foul fiends, and\r\n      swilling the snug blue ruin stowed away for the winter by my\r\n      honest shipmate, Will Wimble, the undertaker!”\r\n\r\n      At this unpardonable piece of ill-breeding, all the original\r\n      company half started to their feet, and uttered the same rapid\r\n      succession of wild fiendish shrieks which had before caught the\r\n      attention of the seamen. The president, however, was the first to\r\n      recover his composure, and at length, turning to Legs with great\r\n      dignity, recommenced:\r\n\r\n      “Most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the\r\n      part of guests so illustrious, unbidden though they be. Know then\r\n      that in these dominions I am monarch, and here rule with\r\n      undivided empire under the title of ‘King Pest the First.’\r\n\r\n      “This apartment, which you no doubt profanely suppose to be the\r\n      shop of Will Wimble the undertaker—a man whom we know not, and\r\n      whose plebeian appellation has never before this night thwarted\r\n      our royal ears—this apartment, I say, is the Dais-Chamber of our\r\n      Palace, devoted to the councils of our kingdom, and to other\r\n      sacred and lofty purposes.\r\n\r\n      “The noble lady who sits opposite is Queen Pest, our Serene\r\n      Consort. The other exalted personages whom you behold are all of\r\n      our family, and wear the insignia of the blood royal under the\r\n      respective titles of ‘His Grace the Arch Duke Pest-Iferous’—‘His\r\n      Grace the Duke Pest-Ilential’—‘His Grace the Duke Tem-Pest’—and\r\n      ‘Her Serene Highness the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.’\r\n\r\n      “As regards,” continued he, “your demand of the business upon\r\n      which we sit here in council, we might be pardoned for replying\r\n      that it concerns, and concerns alone, our own private and regal\r\n      interest, and is in no manner important to any other than\r\n      ourself. But in consideration of those rights to which as guests\r\n      and strangers you may feel yourselves entitled, we will\r\n      furthermore explain that we are here this night, prepared by deep\r\n      research and accurate investigation, to examine, analyze, and\r\n      thoroughly determine the indefinable spirit—the incomprehensible\r\n      qualities and nature—of those inestimable treasures of the\r\n      palate, the wines, ales, and liqueurs of this goodly metropolis:\r\n      by so doing to advance not more our own designs than the true\r\n      welfare of that unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us all,\r\n      whose dominions are unlimited, and whose name is ‘Death’.”\r\n\r\n      “Whose name is Davy Jones!” ejaculated Tarpaulin, helping the\r\n      lady by his side to a skull of liqueur, and pouring out a second\r\n      for himself.\r\n\r\n      “Profane varlet!” said the president, now turning his attention\r\n      to the worthy Hugh, “profane and execrable wretch!—we have said,\r\n      that in consideration of those rights which, even in thy filthy\r\n      person, we feel no inclination to violate, we have condescended\r\n      to make reply to thy rude and unseasonable inquiries. We\r\n      nevertheless, for your unhallowed intrusion upon our councils,\r\n      believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy companion in each a\r\n      gallon of Black Strap—having imbibed which to the prosperity of\r\n      our kingdom—at a single draught—and upon your bended knees—ye\r\n      shall be forthwith free either to proceed upon your way, or\r\n      remain and be admitted to the privileges of our table, according\r\n      to your respective and individual pleasures.”\r\n\r\n      “It would be a matter of utter impossibility,” replied Legs, whom\r\n      the assumptions and dignity of King Pest the First had evidently\r\n      inspired some feelings of respect, and who arose and steadied\r\n      himself by the table as he spoke—“it would, please your majesty,\r\n      be a matter of utter impossibility to stow away in my hold even\r\n      one-fourth part of the same liquor which your majesty has just\r\n      mentioned. To say nothing of the stuffs placed on board in the\r\n      forenoon by way of ballast, and not to mention the various ales\r\n      and liqueurs shipped this evening at different sea-ports, I have,\r\n      at present, a full cargo of ‘humming-stuff’ taken in and duly\r\n      paid for at the sign of the ‘Jolly Tar.’ You will, therefore,\r\n      please your majesty, be so good as to take the will for the\r\n      deed—for by no manner of means either can I or will I swallow\r\n      another drop—least of all a drop of that villainous bilge-water\r\n      that answers to the name of ‘Black Strap.’”\r\n\r\n      “Belay that!” interrupted Tarpaulin, astonished not more at the\r\n      length of his companion’s speech than at the nature of his\r\n      refusal—“Belay that you lubber!—and I say, Legs, none of your\r\n      palaver! _My_ hull is still light, although I confess you\r\n      yourself seem to be a little top-heavy; and as for the matter of\r\n      your share of the cargo, why rather than raise a squall I would\r\n      find stowage-room for it myself, but—”\r\n\r\n      “This proceeding,” interposed the president, “is by no means in\r\n      accordance with the terms of the mulct or sentence, which is in\r\n      its nature Median, and not to be altered or recalled. The\r\n      conditions we have imposed must be fulfilled to the letter, and\r\n      that without a moment’s hesitation—in failure of which fulfilment\r\n      we decree that you do here be tied neck and heels together, and\r\n      duly drowned as rebels in yon hogshead of October beer!”\r\n\r\n      “A sentence!—a sentence!—a righteous and just sentence!—a\r\n      glorious decree!—a most worthy and upright, and holy\r\n      condemnation!” shouted the Pest family altogether. The king\r\n      elevated his forehead into innumerable wrinkles; the gouty little\r\n      old man puffed like a pair of bellows; the lady of the winding\r\n      sheet waved her nose to and fro; the gentleman in the cotton\r\n      drawers pricked up his ears; she of the shroud gasped like a\r\n      dying fish; and he of the coffin looked stiff and rolled up his\r\n      eyes.\r\n\r\n      “Ugh! ugh! ugh!” chuckled Tarpaulin without heeding the general\r\n      excitation, “ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—I was\r\n      saying,” said he, “I was saying when Mr. King Pest poked in his\r\n      marlin-spike, that as for the matter of two or three gallons more\r\n      or less of Black Strap, it was a trifle to a tight sea-boat like\r\n      myself not overstowed—but when it comes to drinking the health of\r\n      the Devil (whom God assoilzie) and going down upon my marrow\r\n      bones to his ill-favored majesty there, whom I know, as well as I\r\n      know myself to be a sinner, to be nobody in the whole world, but\r\n      Tim Hurlygurly the stage-player!—why! it’s quite another guess\r\n      sort of a thing, and utterly and altogether past my\r\n      comprehension.”\r\n\r\n      He was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquillity. At the\r\n      name Tim Hurlygurly the whole assembly leaped from their name\r\n      seats.\r\n\r\n      “Treason!” shouted his Majesty King Pest the First.\r\n\r\n      “Treason!” said the little man with the gout.\r\n\r\n      “Treason!” screamed the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.\r\n\r\n      “Treason!” muttered the gentleman with his jaws tied up.\r\n\r\n      “Treason!” growled he of the coffin.\r\n\r\n      “Treason! treason!” shrieked her majesty of the mouth; and,\r\n      seizing by the hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate\r\n      Tarpaulin, who had just commenced pouring out for himself a skull\r\n      of liqueur, she lifted him high into the air, and let him fall\r\n      without ceremony into the huge open puncheon of his beloved ale.\r\n      Bobbing up and down, for a few seconds, like an apple in a bowl\r\n      of toddy, he, at length, finally disappeared amid the whirlpool\r\n      of foam which, in the already effervescent liquor, his struggles\r\n      easily succeeded in creating.\r\n\r\n      Not tamely, however, did the tall seaman behold the discomfiture\r\n      of his companion. Jostling King Pest through the open trap, the\r\n      valiant Legs slammed the door down upon him with an oath, and\r\n      strode towards the centre of the room. Here tearing down the\r\n      skeleton which swung over the table, he laid it about him with so\r\n      much energy and good will, that, as the last glimpses of light\r\n      died away within the apartment, he succeeded in knocking out the\r\n      brains of the little gentleman with the gout. Rushing then with\r\n      all his force against the fatal hogshead full of October ale and\r\n      Hugh Tarpaulin, he rolled it over and over in an instant. Out\r\n      burst a deluge of liquor so fierce—so impetuous—so\r\n      overwhelming—that the room was flooded from wall to wall—the\r\n      loaded table was overturned—the tressels were thrown upon their\r\n      backs—the tub of punch into the fire-place—and the ladies into\r\n      hysterics. Piles of death-furniture floundered about. Jugs,\r\n      pitchers, and carboys mingled promiscuously in the _mêlée_, and\r\n      wicker flagons encountered desperately with bottles of junk. The\r\n      man with the horrors was drowned upon the spot—the little stiff\r\n      gentleman floated off in his coffin—and the victorious Legs,\r\n      seizing by the waist the fat lady in the shroud, rushed out with\r\n      her into the street, and made a bee-line for the _Free and Easy_,\r\n      followed under easy sail by the redoubtable Hugh Tarpaulin, who,\r\n      having sneezed three or four times, panted and puffed after him\r\n      with the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE SUNDAYS IN A WEEK\r\n\r\n\r\n      “You hard-headed, dunder-headed, obstinate, rusty, crusty, musty,\r\n      fusty, old savage!” said I, in fancy, one afternoon, to my grand\r\n      uncle Rumgudgeon—shaking my fist at him in imagination.\r\n\r\n      Only in imagination. The fact is, some trivial discrepancy _did_\r\n      exist, just then, between what I said and what I had not the\r\n      courage to say—between what I did and what I had half a mind to\r\n      do.\r\n\r\n      The old porpoise, as I opened the drawing-room door, was sitting\r\n      with his feet upon the mantel-piece, and a bumper of port in his\r\n      paw, making strenuous efforts to accomplish the ditty.\r\n\r\n      Remplis ton verre vide!\r\n      Vide ton verre plein!\r\n\r\n      “My _dear_ uncle,” said I, closing the door gently, and\r\n      approaching him with the blandest of smiles, “you are always so\r\n      very kind and considerate, and have evinced your benevolence in\r\n      so many—so very many ways—that—that I feel I have only to suggest\r\n      this little point to you once more to make sure of your full\r\n      acquiescence.”\r\n\r\n      “Hem!” said he, “good boy! go on!”\r\n\r\n      “I am sure, my dearest uncle (you confounded old rascal!), that\r\n      you have no design really, seriously, to oppose my union with\r\n      Kate. This is merely a joke of yours, I know—ha! ha! ha!—how very\r\n      pleasant you are at times.”\r\n\r\n      “Ha! ha! ha!” said he, “curse you! yes!”\r\n\r\n      “To be sure—of course! I knew you were jesting. Now, uncle, all\r\n      that Kate and myself wish at present, is that you would oblige us\r\n      with your advice as—as regards the time—you know, uncle—in short,\r\n      when will it be most convenient for yourself, that the wedding\r\n      shall—shall—come off, you know?”\r\n\r\n      “Come off, you scoundrel!—what do you mean by that?—Better wait\r\n      till it goes on.”\r\n\r\n      “Ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hi! hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!—oh,\r\n      that’s good!—oh, that’s capital—_such_ a wit! But all we want\r\n      just _now_, you know, uncle, is that you would indicate the time\r\n      precisely.”\r\n\r\n      “Ah!—precisely?”\r\n\r\n      “Yes, uncle—that is, if it would be quite agreeable to yourself.”\r\n\r\n      “Wouldn’t it answer, Bobby, if I were to leave it at random—some\r\n      time within a year or so, for example?—_must_ I say precisely?”\r\n\r\n      “_If_ you please, uncle—precisely.”\r\n\r\n      “Well, then, Bobby, my boy—you’re a fine fellow, aren’t\r\n      you?—since you _will_ have the exact time I’ll—why I’ll oblige\r\n      you for once.”\r\n\r\n      “Dear uncle!”\r\n\r\n      “Hush, sir!” (drowning my voice)—“I’ll oblige you for once. You\r\n      shall have my consent—and the _plum_, we mus’n’t forget the\r\n      plum—let me see! when shall it be? To-day’s Sunday—isn’t it?\r\n      Well, then, you shall be married precisely—_precisely_, now\r\n      mind!—_when three Sundays come together in a week!_ Do you hear\r\n      me, sir! _What_ are you gaping at? I say, you shall have Kate and\r\n      her plum when three Sundays come together in a week—but not\r\n      _till_ then—you young scapegrace—not _till_ then, if I die for\r\n      it. You know me—_I’m a man of my word_—now be off!” Here he\r\n      swallowed his bumper of port, while I rushed from the room in\r\n      despair.\r\n\r\n      A very “fine old English gentleman,” was my grand-uncle\r\n      Rumgudgeon, but unlike him of the song, he had his weak points.\r\n      He was a little, pursy, pompous, passionate semicircular\r\n      somebody, with a red nose, a thick skull, a long purse, and a\r\n      strong sense of his own consequence. With the best heart in the\r\n      world, he contrived, through a predominant whim of contradiction,\r\n      to earn for himself, among those who only knew him superficially,\r\n      the character of a curmudgeon. Like many excellent people, he\r\n      seemed possessed with a spirit of tantalization, which might\r\n      easily, at a casual glance, have been mistaken for malevolence.\r\n      To every request, a positive “No!” was his immediate answer; but\r\n      in the end—in the long, long end—there were exceedingly few\r\n      requests which he refused. Against all attacks upon his purse he\r\n      made the most sturdy defence; but the amount extorted from him,\r\n      at last, was generally in direct ratio with the length of the\r\n      siege and the stubbornness of the resistance. In charity no one\r\n      gave more liberally or with a worse grace.\r\n\r\n      For the fine arts, and especially for the belles-lettres, he\r\n      entertained a profound contempt. With this he had been inspired\r\n      by Casimir Perier, whose pert little query “A quoi un poete est\r\n      il bon?” he was in the habit of quoting, with a very droll\r\n      pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra of logical wit. Thus my own\r\n      inkling for the Muses had excited his entire displeasure. He\r\n      assured me one day, when I asked him for a new copy of Horace,\r\n      that the translation of “Poeta nascitur non fit” was “a nasty\r\n      poet for nothing fit”—a remark which I took in high dudgeon. His\r\n      repugnance to “the humanities” had, also, much increased of late,\r\n      by an accidental bias in favor of what he supposed to be natural\r\n      science. Somebody had accosted him in the street, mistaking him\r\n      for no less a personage than Doctor Dubble L. Dee, the lecturer\r\n      upon quack physics. This set him off at a tangent; and just at\r\n      the epoch of this story—for story it is getting to be after\r\n      all—my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only\r\n      upon points which happened to chime in with the caprioles of the\r\n      hobby he was riding. For the rest, he laughed with his arms and\r\n      legs, and his politics were stubborn and easily understood. He\r\n      thought, with Horsley, that “the people have nothing to do with\r\n      the laws but to obey them.”\r\n\r\n      I had lived with the old gentleman all my life. My parents, in\r\n      dying, had bequeathed me to him as a rich legacy. I believe the\r\n      old villain loved me as his own child—nearly if not quite as well\r\n      as he loved Kate—but it was a dog’s existence that he led me,\r\n      after all. From my first year until my fifth, he obliged me with\r\n      very regular floggings. From five to fifteen, he threatened me,\r\n      hourly, with the House of Correction. From fifteen to twenty, not\r\n      a day passed in which he did not promise to cut me off with a\r\n      shilling. I was a sad dog, it is true—but then it was a part of\r\n      my nature—a point of my faith. In Kate, however, I had a firm\r\n      friend, and I knew it. She was a good girl, and told me very\r\n      sweetly that I might have her (plum and all) whenever I could\r\n      badger my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon, into the necessary consent.\r\n      Poor girl!—she was barely fifteen, and without this consent, her\r\n      little amount in the funds was not come-at-able until five\r\n      immeasurable summers had “dragged their slow length along.” What,\r\n      then, to do? At fifteen, or even at twenty-one (for I had now\r\n      passed my fifth olympiad) five years in prospect are very much\r\n      the same as five hundred. In vain we besieged the old gentleman\r\n      with importunities. Here was a piece de resistance (as Messieurs\r\n      Ude and Careme would say) which suited his perverse fancy to a T.\r\n      It would have stiffed the indignation of Job himself, to see how\r\n      much like an old mouser he behaved to us two poor wretched little\r\n      mice. In his heart he wished for nothing more ardently than our\r\n      union. He had made up his mind to this all along. In fact, he\r\n      would have given ten thousand pounds from his own pocket (Kate’s\r\n      plum was her own) if he could have invented any thing like an\r\n      excuse for complying with our very natural wishes. But then we\r\n      had been so imprudent as to broach the subject ourselves. Not to\r\n      oppose it under such circumstances, I sincerely believe, was not\r\n      in his power.\r\n\r\n      I have said already that he had his weak points; but in speaking\r\n      of these, I must not be understood as referring to his obstinacy:\r\n      which was one of his strong points—“assurement ce n’ etait pas sa\r\n      foible.” When I mention his weakness I have allusion to a bizarre\r\n      old-womanish superstition which beset him. He was great in\r\n      dreams, portents, et id genus omne of rigmarole. He was\r\n      excessively punctilious, too, upon small points of honor, and,\r\n      after his own fashion, was a man of his word, beyond doubt. This\r\n      was, in fact, one of his hobbies. The spirit of his vows he made\r\n      no scruple of setting at naught, but the letter was a bond\r\n      inviolable. Now it was this latter peculiarity in his\r\n      disposition, of which Kate’s ingenuity enabled us one fine day,\r\n      not long after our interview in the dining-room, to take a very\r\n      unexpected advantage, and, having thus, in the fashion of all\r\n      modern bards and orators, exhausted in prolegomena, all the time\r\n      at my command, and nearly all the room at my disposal, I will sum\r\n      up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of the story.\r\n\r\n      It happened then—so the Fates ordered it—that among the naval\r\n      acquaintances of my betrothed, were two gentlemen who had just\r\n      set foot upon the shores of England, after a year’s absence,\r\n      each, in foreign travel. In company with these gentlemen, my\r\n      cousin and I, preconcertedly paid uncle Rumgudgeon a visit on the\r\n      afternoon of Sunday, October the tenth,—just three weeks after\r\n      the memorable decision which had so cruelly defeated our hopes.\r\n      For about half an hour the conversation ran upon ordinary topics,\r\n      but at last, we contrived, quite naturally, to give it the\r\n      following turn:\r\n\r\n      CAPT. PRATT. “Well I have been absent just one year.—Just one\r\n      year to-day, as I live—let me see! yes!—this is October the\r\n      tenth. You remember, Mr. Rumgudgeon, I called, this day year to\r\n      bid you good-bye. And by the way, it does seem something like a\r\n      coincidence, does it not—that our friend, Captain Smitherton,\r\n      here, has been absent exactly a year also—a year to-day!”\r\n\r\n      SMITHERTON. “Yes! just one year to a fraction. You will remember,\r\n      Mr. Rumgudgeon, that I called with Capt. Pratol on this very day,\r\n      last year, to pay my parting respects.”\r\n\r\n      UNCLE. “Yes, yes, yes—I remember it very well—very queer indeed!\r\n      Both of you gone just one year. A very strange coincidence,\r\n      indeed! Just what Doctor Dubble L. Dee would denominate an\r\n      extraordinary concurrence of events. Doctor Dub—”\r\n\r\n      KATE. (Interrupting.) “To be sure, papa, it is something strange;\r\n      but then Captain Pratt and Captain Smitherton didn’t go\r\n      altogether the same route, and that makes a difference, you\r\n      know.”\r\n\r\n      UNCLE. “I don’t know any such thing, you huzzy! How should I? I\r\n      think it only makes the matter more remarkable, Doctor Dubble L.\r\n      Dee—”\r\n\r\n      KATE. “Why, papa, Captain Pratt went round Cape Horn, and Captain\r\n      Smitherton doubled the Cape of Good Hope.”\r\n\r\n      UNCLE. “Precisely!—the one went east and the other went west, you\r\n      jade, and they both have gone quite round the world. By the by,\r\n      Doctor Dubble L. Dee—”\r\n\r\n      MYSELF. (Hurriedly.) “Captain Pratt, you must come and spend the\r\n      evening with us to-morrow—you and Smitherton—you can tell us all\r\n      about your voyage, and we’ll have a game of whist and—”\r\n\r\n      PRATT. “Wist, my dear fellow—you forget. To-morrow will be\r\n      Sunday. Some other evening—”\r\n\r\n      KATE. “Oh, no, fie!—Robert’s not quite so bad as that. To-day’s\r\n      Sunday.”\r\n\r\n      PRATT. “I beg both your pardons—but I can’t be so much mistaken.\r\n      I know to-morrow’s Sunday, because-”\r\n\r\n      SMITHERTON. (Much surprised.) “What are you all thinking about?\r\n      Wasn’t yesterday, Sunday, I should like to know?”\r\n\r\n      ALL. “Yesterday indeed! you are out!”\r\n\r\n      UNCLE. “To-day’s Sunday, I say—don’t I know?”\r\n\r\n      PRATT. “Oh no!—to-morrow’s Sunday.”\r\n\r\n      SMITHERTON. “You are all mad—every one of you. I am as positive\r\n      that yesterday was Sunday as I am that I sit upon this chair.”\r\n\r\n      KATE. (Jumping up eagerly.) “I see it—I see it all. Papa, this is\r\n      a judgment upon you, about—about you know what. Let me alone, and\r\n      I’ll explain it all in a minute. It’s a very simple thing,\r\n      indeed. Captain Smitherton says that yesterday was Sunday: so it\r\n      was; he is right. Cousin Bobby, and uncle and I say that to-day\r\n      is Sunday: so it is; we are right. Captain Pratt maintains that\r\n      to-morrow will be Sunday: so it will; he is right, too. The fact\r\n      is, we are all right, and thus three Sundays have come together\r\n      in a week.”\r\n\r\n      SMITHERTON. (After a pause.) “By the by, Pratt, Kate has us\r\n      completely. What fools we two are! Mr. Rumgudgeon, the matter\r\n      stands thus: the earth, you know, is twenty-four thousand miles\r\n      in circumference. Now this globe of the earth turns upon its own\r\n      axis—revolves—spins round—these twenty-four thousand miles of\r\n      extent, going from west to east, in precisely twenty-four hours.\r\n      Do you understand, Mr. Rumgudgeon?—”\r\n\r\n      UNCLE. “To be sure—to be sure—Doctor Dub—”\r\n\r\n      SMITHERTON. (Drowning his voice.) “Well, sir; that is at the rate\r\n      of one thousand miles per hour. Now, suppose that I sail from\r\n      this position a thousand miles east. Of course I anticipate the\r\n      rising of the sun here at London by just one hour. I see the sun\r\n      rise one hour before you do. Proceeding, in the same direction,\r\n      yet another thousand miles, I anticipate the rising by two\r\n      hours—another thousand, and I anticipate it by three hours, and\r\n      so on, until I go entirely round the globe, and back to this\r\n      spot, when, having gone twenty-four thousand miles east, I\r\n      anticipate the rising of the London sun by no less than\r\n      twenty-four hours; that is to say, I am a day in advance of your\r\n      time. Understand, eh?”\r\n\r\n      UNCLE. “But Double L. Dee—”\r\n\r\n      SMITHERTON. (Speaking very loud.) “Captain Pratt, on the\r\n      contrary, when he had sailed a thousand miles west of this\r\n      position, was an hour, and when he had sailed twenty-four\r\n      thousand miles west, was twenty-four hours, or one day, behind\r\n      the time at London. Thus, with me, yesterday was Sunday—thus,\r\n      with you, to-day is Sunday—and thus, with Pratt, to-morrow will\r\n      be Sunday. And what is more, Mr. Rumgudgeon, it is positively\r\n      clear that we are all right; for there can be no philosophical\r\n      reason assigned why the idea of one of us should have preference\r\n      over that of the other.”\r\n\r\n      UNCLE. “My eyes!—well, Kate—well, Bobby!—this is a judgment upon\r\n      me, as you say. But I am a man of my word—mark that! you shall\r\n      have her, boy, (plum and all), when you please. Done up, by Jove!\r\n      Three Sundays all in a row! I’ll go, and take Dubble L. Dee’s\r\n      opinion upon that.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, Volume 3, by Edgar Allan Poe\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WORKS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE, VOL. 3 ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2149-0.txt or 2149-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/4/2149/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

GORDON PYM\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\n      Upon my return to the United States a few months ago, after the\n      extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and\n      elsewhere, of which an account is given in the following pages,\n      accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in\n      Richmond, Va., who felt deep interest in all matters relating to\n      the regions I had visited, and who were constantly urging it upon\n      me, as a duty, to give my narrative to the public. I had several","reasons, however, for declining to do so, some of which were of a\n      nature altogether private, and concern no person but myself;\n      others not so much so. One consideration which deterred me was\n      that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time\n      in which I was absent, I feared I should not be able to write,\n      from mere memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have\n      the _appearance_of that truth it would really possess, barring\n      only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us\n      are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence\r\nin exciting the imaginative faculties. Another reason was, that\n      the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively\n      marvellous that, unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be\n      (except by the evidence of a single individual, and he a\n      half-breed Indian), I could only hope for belief among my family,\n      and those of my friends who have had reason, through life, to put\n      faith in my veracity—the probability being that the public at\n      large would regard what I should put forth as merely an impudent\n      and ingenious fiction. A distrust in my own abilities as a writer\r\nwas, nevertheless, one of the principal causes which prevented me\n      from complying with the suggestions of my advisers.\n\n      Among those gentlemen in Virginia who expressed the greatest\n      interest in my statement, more particularly in regard to that\n      portion of it which related to the Antarctic Ocean, was Mr. Poe,\n      lately editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger,” a monthly\n      magazine, published by Mr. Thomas W. White, in the city of\n      Richmond. He strongly advised me, among others, to prepare at\n      once a full account of what I had seen and undergone, and trust","to the shrewdness and common-sense of the public—insisting, with\n      great plausibility, that however roughly, as regards mere\n      authorship, my book should be got up, its very uncouthness, if\n      there were any, would give it all the better chance of being\n      received as truth.\n\n      Notwithstanding this representation, I did not make up my mind to\n      do as he suggested. He afterward proposed (finding that I would\n      not stir in the matter) that I should allow him to draw up, in\n      his own words, a narrative of the earlier portion of my\n      adventures, from facts afforded by myself, publishing it in the\r\n“Southern Messenger” _under the garb of fiction. _To this,\n      perceiving no objection, I consented, stipulating only that my\n      real name should be retained. Two numbers of the pretended\n      fiction appeared, consequently, in the “Messenger” for January\n      and February (1837), and, in order that it might certainly be\n      regarded as fiction, the name of Mr. Poe was affixed to the\n      articles in the table of contents of the magazine.\n\n      The manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at\n      length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the\r\nadventures in question; for I found that, in spite of the air of\n      fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of\n      my statement which appeared in the “Messenger” (without altering\n      or distorting a single fact), the public were still not at all\n      disposed to receive it as fable, and several letters were sent to\n      Mr. P.’s address, distinctly expressing a conviction to the\n      contrary. I thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would\n      prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence\n      of their own authenticity, and that I had consequently little to","fear on the score of popular incredulity.\n\n      This _exposé_being made, it will be seen at once how much of what\n      follows I claim to be my own writing; and it will also be\n      understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages\n      which were written by Mr. Poe. Even to those readers who have not\n      seen the “Messenger,” it will be unnecessary to point out where\n      his portion ends and my own commences; the difference in point of\n      style will be readily perceived.\n\nA. G. PYM.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n\n      My name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My father was a respectable trader\r\nin sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My maternal\n      grandfather was an attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in\n      every thing, and had speculated very successfully in stocks of\n      the Edgarton New Bank, as it was formerly called. By these and\n      other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money. He\n      was more attached to myself, I believe, than to any other person\n      in the world, and I expected to inherit the most of his property\n      at his death. He sent me, at six years of age, to the school of\n      old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric\r\nmanners—he is well known to almost every person who has visited\n      New Bedford. I stayed at his school until I was sixteen, when I\n      left him for Mr. E. Ronald’s academy on the hill. Here I became\n      intimate with the son of Mr. Barnard, a sea-captain, who\n      generally sailed in the employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh—Mr.\n      Barnard is also very well known in New Bedford, and has many\n      relations, I am certain, in Edgarton. His son was named Augustus,\n      and he was nearly two years older than myself. He had been on a\n      whaling voyage with his father in the John Donaldson, and was","always talking to me of his adventures in the South Pacific\n      Ocean. I used frequently to go home with him, and remain all day,\n      and sometimes all night. We occupied the same bed, and he would\n      be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories\n      of the natives of the Island of Tinian, and other places he had\n      visited in his travels. At last I could not help being interested\n      in what he said, and by degrees I felt the greatest desire to go\n      to sea. I owned a sailboat called the Ariel, and worth about\n      seventy-five dollars. She had a half-deck or cuddy, and was\r\nrigged sloop-fashion—I forget her tonnage, but she would hold ten\n      persons without much crowding. In this boat we were in the habit\n      of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when I\n      now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am\n      alive to-day.\n\n      I will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a\n      longer and more momentous narrative. One night there was a party\n      at Mr. Barnard’s, and both Augustus and myself were not a little\n      intoxicated toward the close of it. As usual, in such cases, I\n      took part of his bed in preference to going home. He went to\r\nsleep, as I thought, very quietly (it being near one when the\n      party broke up), and without saying a word on his favorite topic.\n      It might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in\n      bed, and I was just about falling into a doze, when he suddenly\n      started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go\n      to sleep for any Arthur Pym in Christendom, when there was so\n      glorious a breeze from the southwest. I never was so astonished\n      in my life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the\n      wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside","himself. He proceeded to talk very coolly, however, saying he\n      knew that I supposed him intoxicated, but that he was never more\n      sober in his life. He was only tired, he added, of lying in bed\n      on such a fine night like a dog, and was determined to get up and\n      dress, and go out on a frolic with the boat. I can hardly tell\n      what possessed me, but the words were no sooner out of his mouth\n      than I felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure, and\n      thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most\n      reasonable things in the world. It was blowing almost a gale, and\r\nthe weather was very cold—it being late in October. I sprang out\n      of bed, nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him I was\n      quite as brave as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying\n      in bed like a dog, and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as\n      any Augustus Barnard in Nantucket.\n\n      We lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to\n      the boat. She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the\n      lumber-yard of Pankey & Co., and almost thumping her side out\n      against the rough logs. Augustus got into her and bailed her, for\n      she was nearly half full of water. This being done, we hoisted\r\njib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly out to sea.\n\n      The wind, as I before said, blew freshly from the southwest. The\n      night was very clear and cold. Augustus had taken the helm, and I\n      stationed myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. We flew\n      along at a great rate—neither of us having said a word since\n      casting loose from the wharf. I now asked my companion what\n      course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable\n      we should get back. He whistled for a few minutes, and then said\n      crustily: “_I_ am going to sea—_you_ may go home if you think","proper.” Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once that, in\n      spite of his assumed _nonchalance_, he was greatly agitated. I\n      could see him distinctly by the light of the moon—his face was\n      paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he\n      could scarcely retain hold of the tiller. I found that something\n      had gone wrong, and became seriously alarmed. At this period I\n      knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending\n      entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend. The wind, too, had\n      suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the\r\nland—still I was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for\n      almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. I could stand\n      it no longer, however, and spoke to Augustus about the propriety\n      of turning back. As before, it was nearly a minute before he made\n      answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. “By-and-by,” said he\n      at length—“time enough—home by-and-by.” I had expected a similar\n      reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which\n      filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again looked\n      at the speaker attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and\r\nhis knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely\n      able to stand. “For God’s sake, Augustus,” I screamed, now\n      heartily frightened, “what ails you?—what is the matter?—what\n      _are_ you going to do?” “Matter!” he stammered, in the greatest\n      apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and\n      falling forward into the bottom of the boat—“matter—why, nothing\n      is the—matter—going home—d—d—don’t you see?” The whole truth now\n      flashed upon me. I flew to him and raised him up. He was\n      drunk—beastly drunk—he could no longer either stand, speak, or","see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go in the\n      extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the\n      bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. It was evident that,\n      during the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and\n      that his conduct in bed had been the result of a\n      highly-concentrated state of intoxication—a state which, like\n      madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward\n      demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. The\n      coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect—the\r\nmental energy began to yield before its influence—and the\n      confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous\n      situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now\n      thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would\n      be otherwise for many hours.\n\n      It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. The\n      fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly\n      timid and irresolute. I knew that I was altogether incapable of\n      managing the boat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide\n      were hurrying us to destruction. A storm was evidently gathering\r\nbehind us; we had neither compass nor provisions; and it was\n      clear that, if we held our present course, we should be out of\n      sight of land before daybreak. These thoughts, with a crowd of\n      others equally fearful, flashed through my mind with a\n      bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me beyond\n      the possibility of making any exertion. The boat was going\n      through the water at a terrible rate—full before the wind—no reef\n      in either jib or mainsail—running her bows completely under the\n      foam. It was a thousand wonders she did not broach to—Augustus","having let go the tiller, as I said before, and I being too much\n      agitated to think of taking it myself. By good luck, however, she\n      kept steady, and gradually I recovered some degree of presence of\n      mind. Still the wind was increasing fearfully, and whenever we\n      rose from a plunge forward, the sea behind fell combing over our\n      counter, and deluged us with water. I was so utterly benumbed,\n      too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious of sensation. At\n      length I summoned up the resolution of despair, and rushing to\n      the mainsail let it go by the run. As might have been expected,\r\nit flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with water, carried\n      away the mast short off by the board. This latter accident alone\n      saved me from instant destruction. Under the jib only, I now\n      boomed along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally\n      over the counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate\n      death. I took the helm, and breathed with greater freedom as I\n      found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape.\n      Augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat; and as\n      there was imminent danger of his drowning (the water being nearly\r\na foot deep just where he fell), I contrived to raise him\n      partially up, and keep him in a sitting position, by passing a\n      rope round his waist, and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of\n      the cuddy. Having thus arranged every thing as well as I could in\n      my chilled and agitated condition, I recommended myself to God,\n      and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the\n      fortitude in my power.\n\n      Hardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and\n      long scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons,","seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat.\n      Never while I live shall I forget the intense agony of terror I\n      experienced at that moment. My hair stood erect on my head—I felt\n      the blood congealing in my veins—my heart ceased utterly to beat,\n      and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my\n      alarm, I tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my\n      fallen companion.\n\n      I found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large\n      whaling-ship (the Penguin) bound to Nantucket. Several persons\n      were standing over me, and Augustus, paler than death, was busily\r\noccupied in chafing my hands. Upon seeing me open my eyes, his\n      exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and\n      tears from the rough-looking personages who were present. The\n      mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained. We had\n      been run down by the whaling-ship, which was close-hauled,\n      beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture to set,\n      and consequently running almost at right angles to our own\n      course. Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not\n      perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming\r\nin contact—their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so\n      terribly alarmed me. The huge ship, I was told, rode immediately\n      over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have\n      passed over a feather, and without the least perceptible\n      impediment to her progress. Not a scream arose from the deck of\n      the victim—there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling\n      with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was\n      swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her\n      destroyer—but this was all. Thinking our boat (which it will be","remembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless,\n      the captain (Captain E. T. V. Block, of New London) was for\n      proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about\n      the matter. Luckily, there were two of the look-out who swore\n      positively to having seen some person at our helm, and\n      represented the possibility of yet saving him. A discussion\n      ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said that “it\n      was no business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells;\n      that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense; and if\r\nthere was a man run down, it was nobody’s fault but his own, he\n      might drown and be dammed” or some language to that effect.\n      Henderson, the first mate, now took the matter up, being justly\n      indignant, as well as the whole ship’s crew, at a speech evincing\n      so base a degree of heartless atrocity. He spoke plainly, seeing\n      himself upheld by the men, told the captain he considered him a\n      fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey his orders\n      if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore. He\n      strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer)\r\non one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm\n      voice, Hard-a-lee! The men flew to their posts, and the ship went\n      cleverly about. All this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it\n      was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that\n      any individual could be saved—allowing any to have been on board\n      the boat. Yet, as the reader has seen, both Augustus and myself\n      were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought\n      about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune\n      which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special\n      interference of Providence.","While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat\n      and jumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke\n      up as having seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of\n      the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long\n      and heavy roll to windward, and Henderson, at the same moment,\n      starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water. He\n      would say nothing else—repeating his cry impatiently, back water!\n      back water! The men put back as speedily as possible, but by this\n      time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway,\r\nalthough all hands on board were making great exertions to take\n      in sail. In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung\n      to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another\n      huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of\n      water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety\n      was rendered obvious enough. The body of a man was seen to be\n      affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining\n      bottom (the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and\n      beating violently against it with every movement of the hull.\r\nAfter several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the\n      ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally\n      disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board—for the\n      body proved to be my own. It appeared that one of the\n      timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the\n      copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed under the ship,\n      and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. The\n      head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green\n      baize jacket I had on, and through the back part of my neck,","forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right\n      ear. I was immediately put to bed—although life seemed to be\n      totally extinct. There was no surgeon on board. The captain,\n      however, treated me with every attention—to make amends, I\n      presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in\n      the previous portion of the adventure.\n\n      In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship,\n      although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. He had not\n      been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our\n      boat, and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that\r\nhe could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring\n      of the tempest. This induced the hardy seamen to persevere in\n      their search for more than half an hour, although repeated\n      signals to return were made them by Captain Block, and although\n      every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them\n      with the most imminent and deadly peril. Indeed, it is nearly\n      impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could\n      have escaped destruction for a single instant. She was built,\n      however, for the whaling service, and was fitted, as I have since\r\nhad reason to believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some\n      life-boats used on the coast of Wales.\n\n      After searching in vain for about the period of time just\n      mentioned, it was determined to get back to the ship. They had\n      scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark\n      object that floated rapidly by. They pursued and soon overtook\n      it. It proved to be the entire deck of the Ariel’s cuddy.\n      Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the last agonies.\n      Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a","rope to the floating timber. This rope, it will be remembered, I\n      had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt,\n      for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so\n      doing, it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving\n      his life. The Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down\n      her frame naturally went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as\n      might have been expected, was lifted, by the force of the water\n      rushing in, entirely from the main timbers, and floated (with\n      other fragments, no doubt) to the surface—Augustus was buoyed up\r\nwith it, and thus escaped a terrible death.\n\n      It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin\n      before he could give any account of himself, or be made to\n      comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our\n      boat. At length he became thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of\n      his sensations while in the water. Upon his first attaining any\n      degree of consciousness, he found himself beneath the surface,\n      whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity, and with a\n      rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck. In an\r\ninstant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward, when, his\n      head striking violently against a hard substance, he again\n      relapsed into insensibility. Upon once more reviving he was in\n      fuller possession of his reason—this was still, however, in the\n      greatest degree clouded and confused. He now knew that some\n      accident had occurred, and that he was in the water, although his\n      mouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some\n      freedom. Possibly, at this period the deck was drifting rapidly\n      before the wind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his","back. Of course, as long as he could have retained this position,\n      it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned.\n      Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck, and this\n      post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals for help.\n      Just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been\n      obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into\n      the sea, had given himself up for lost. During the whole period\n      of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the\n      Ariel, nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his\r\ndisaster. A vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire\n      possession of his faculties. When he was finally picked up, every\n      power of his mind had failed him; and, as before said, it was\n      nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin before he\n      became fully aware of his condition. In regard to myself—I was\n      resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and\n      after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours\n      and a half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot\n      oil—a proceeding suggested by Augustus. The wound in my neck,\r\nalthough of an ugly appearance, proved of little real\n      consequence, and I soon recovered from its effects.\n\n      The Penguin got into port about nine o’clock in the morning,\n      after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off\n      Nantucket. Both Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr.\n      Barnard’s in time for breakfast—which, luckily, was somewhat\n      late, owing to the party over night. I suppose all at the table\n      were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded\n      appearance—of course, it would not have borne a very rigid\n      scrutiny. Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way","of deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in\n      Nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story\n      told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at\n      sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils, had reference\n      either to the Ariel, my companion, or myself. We two have since\n      very frequently talked the matter over—but never without a\n      shudder. In one of our conversations Augustus frankly confessed\n      to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so\n      excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat\r\nhe first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt\n      himself sinking beneath its influence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\n      In no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce\n      inferences with entire certainty, even from the most simple data.\n      It might be supposed that a catastrophe such as I have just\n      related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for\n      the sea. On the contrary, I never experienced a more ardent\n      longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a\n      navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance.\r\nThis short period proved amply long enough to erase from my\n      memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the\n      pleasurably exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of\n      the late perilous accident. My conversations with Augustus grew\n      daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest. He had a\n      manner of relating his stories of the ocean (more than one half\n      of which I now suspect to have been sheer fabrications) well\n      adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament\n      and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination. It is strange,","too, that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the\n      life of a seaman, when he depicted his more terrible moments of\n      suffering and despair. For the bright side of the painting I had\n      a limited sympathy. My visions were of shipwreck and famine; of\n      death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged\n      out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in an\n      ocean unapproachable and unknown. Such visions or desires—for\n      they amounted to desires—are common, I have since been assured,\n      to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men—at the\r\ntime of which I speak I regarded them only as prophetic glimpses\n      of a destiny which I felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil.\n      Augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind. It is\n      probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had resulted in a\n      partial interchange of character.\n\n      About eighteen months after the period of the Ariel’s disaster,\n      the firm of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some\n      manner with the Messieurs Enderby, I believe, of Liverpool) were\n      engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig Grampus for a\n      whaling voyage. She was an old hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when\r\nall was done to her that could be done. I hardly know why she was\n      chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same\n      owners—but so it was. Mr. Barnard was appointed to command her,\n      and Augustus was going with him. While the brig was getting\n      ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the\n      opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. He\n      found me by no means an unwilling listener—yet the matter could\n      not be so easily arranged. My father made no direct opposition;\n      but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the","design; and, more than all, my grandfather, from whom I expected\n      much, vowed to cut me off with a shilling if I should ever broach\n      the subject to him again. These difficulties, however, so far\n      from abating my desire, only added fuel to the flame. I\n      determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my\n      intentions to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it\n      might be accomplished. In the meantime I forbore speaking to any\n      of my relations in regard to the voyage, and, as I busied myself\n      ostensibly with my usual studies, it was supposed that I had\r\nabandoned the design. I have since frequently examined my conduct\n      on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of\n      surprise. The intense hypocrisy I made use of for the furtherance\n      of my project—an hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my\n      life for so long a period of time—could only have been rendered\n      tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with\n      which I looked forward to the fulfilment of my long-cherished\n      visions of travel.\n\n      In pursuance of my scheme of deception, I was necessarily obliged\n      to leave much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for\r\nthe greater part of every day on board the Grampus, attending to\n      some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. At\n      night, however, we were sure to have a conference and talk over\n      our hopes. After nearly a month passed in this manner, without\n      our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told\n      me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary. I\n      had a relation living in New Bedford, a Mr. Ross, at whose house\n      I was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at\n      a time. The brig was to sail about the middle of June (June,","1827), and it was agreed that, a day or two before her putting to\n      sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual, from Mr. Ross,\n      asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with Robert and\n      Emmet (his sons). Augustus charged himself with the inditing of\n      this note and getting it delivered. Having set out as supposed,\n      for New Bedford, I was then to report myself to my companion, who\n      would contrive a hiding-place for me in the Grampus. This\n      hiding-place, he assured me, would be rendered sufficiently\n      comfortable for a residence of many days, during which I was not\r\nto make my appearance. When the brig had proceeded so far on her\n      course as to make any turning back a matter out of question, I\n      should then, he said, be formally installed in all the comforts\n      of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh heartily\n      at the joke. Vessels enough would be met with by which a letter\n      might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents.\n\n      The middle of June at length arrived, and every thing had been\n      matured. The note was written and delivered, and on a Monday\n      morning I left the house for the New Bedford packet, as supposed.\r\nI went, however, straight to Augustus, who was waiting for me at\n      the corner of a street. It had been our original plan that I\n      should keep out of the way until dark, and then slip on board the\n      brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our favor, it was\n      agreed to lose no time in secreting me. Augustus led the way to\n      the wharf, and I followed at a little distance, enveloped in a\n      thick seaman’s cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my\n      person might not be easily recognized. Just as we turned the\n      second corner, after passing Mr. Edmund’s well, who should","appear, standing right in front of me, and looking me full in the\n      face, but old Mr. Peterson, my grandfather. “Why, bless my soul,\n      Gordon,” said he, after a long pause, “why, why,—whose dirty\n      cloak is that you have on?” “Sir!” I replied, assuming, as well\n      as I could, in the exigency of the moment, an air of offended\n      surprise, and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable\n      tones—“sir! you are a sum’mat mistaken—my name, in the first\n      place, bee’nt nothing at all like Goddin, and I’d want you for to\n      know better, you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty\r\none.” For my life I could hardly refrain from screaming with\n      laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received\n      this handsome rebuke. He started back two or three steps, turned\n      first pale and then excessively red, threw up his spectacles,\n      then, putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with his umbrella\n      uplifted. He stopped short, however, in his career, as if struck\n      with a sudden recollection; and presently, turning round, hobbled\n      off down the street, shaking all the while with rage, and\n      muttering between his teeth: “Won’t do—new glasses—thought it was\r\nGordon—d—d good-for-nothing salt water Long Tom.”\n\n      After this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and\n      arrived at our point of destination in safety. There were only\n      one or two of the hands on board, and these were busy forward,\n      doing something to the forecastle combings. Captain Barnard, we\n      knew very well, was engaged at Lloyd and Vredenburgh’s, and would\n      remain there until late in the evening, so we had little to\n      apprehend on his account. Augustus went first up the vessel’s\n      side, and in a short while I followed him, without being noticed","by the men at work. We proceeded at once into the cabin, and\n      found no person there. It was fitted up in the most comfortable\n      style—a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. There were\n      four very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths.\n      There was also a large stove, I took notice, and a remarkably\n      thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin\n      and staterooms. The ceiling was full seven feet high, and, in\n      short, every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature\n      than I had anticipated. Augustus, however, would allow me but\r\nlittle time for observation, insisting upon the necessity of my\n      concealing myself as soon as possible. He led the way into his\n      own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and\n      next to the bulkheads. Upon entering, he closed the door and\n      bolted it. I thought I had never seen a nicer little room than\n      the one in which I now found myself. It was about ten feet long,\n      and had only one berth, which, as I said before, was wide and\n      convenient. In that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads\n      there was a space of four feet square, containing a table, a\r\nchair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books, chiefly books\n      of voyages and travels. There were many other little comforts in\n      the room, among which I ought not to forget a kind of safe or\n      refrigerator, in which Augustus pointed out to me a host of\n      delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department.\n\n      He now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the\n      carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know\n      that a portion of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had\n      been neatly cut out and again adjusted. As he pressed, this\n      portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of","his finger beneath. In this manner he raised the mouth of the\n      trap (to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks), and I\n      found that it led into the after hold. He next lit a small taper\n      by means of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a dark\n      lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me\n      follow. I did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by\n      means of a nail driven into the under side—the carpet, of course,\n      resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom, and\n      all traces of the aperture being concealed.\r\nThe taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest\n      difficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of\n      lumber among which I now found myself. By degrees, however, my\n      eyes became accustomed to the gloom, and I proceeded with less\n      trouble, holding on to the skirts of my friend’s coat. He brought\n      me, at length, after creeping and winding through innumerable\n      narrow passages, to an iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes\n      for packing fine earthenware. It was nearly four feet high, and\n      full six long, but very narrow. Two large empty oil-casks lay on\r\nthe top of it, and above these, again, a vast quantity of straw\n      matting, piled up as high as the floor of the cabin. In every\n      other direction around was wedged as closely as possible, even up\n      to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every species of\n      ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of crates,\n      hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less\n      than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the\n      box. I afterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the\n      stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough","concealment, having had only one assistant in the labour, a man\n      not going out in the brig.\n\n      My companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could\n      be removed at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the\n      interior, at which I was excessively amused. A mattress from one\n      of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it\n      contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be\n      crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time,\n      sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting\n      position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were\r\nsome books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full\n      of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna\n      sausages, an enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a\n      dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs. I proceeded immediately\n      to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings\n      of higher satisfaction, I am sure, than any monarch ever\n      experienced upon entering a new palace. Augustus now pointed out\n      to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then,\n      holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark\r\nwhipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my\n      hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the\n      lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold,\n      immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom. By\n      means of this cord I should be enabled readily to trace my way\n      out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident\n      should render such a step necessary. He now took his departure,\n      leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of\n      tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as often","as he could contrive to do so without observation. This was on\n      the seventeenth of June.\n\n      I remained three days and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in\n      my hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice\n      for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between\n      two crates just opposite the opening. During the whole period I\n      saw nothing of Augustus; but this occasioned me little\n      uneasiness, as I knew the brig was expected to put to sea every\n      hour, and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of\n      coming down to me. At length I heard the trap open and shut, and\r\npresently he called in a low voice, asking if all was well, and\n      if there was any thing I wanted. “Nothing,” I replied; “I am as\n      comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?” “She will be\n      under weigh in less than half an hour,” he answered. “I came to\n      let you know, and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. I\n      shall not have a chance of coming down again for some\n      time—perhaps for three or four days more. All is going on right\n      aboveboard. After I go up and close the trap, do you creep along\n      by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in. You will find my\r\nwatch there—it may be useful to you, as you have no daylight to\n      keep time by. I suppose you can’t tell how long you have been\n      buried—only three days—this is the twentieth. I would bring the\n      watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed.” With this he\n      went up.\n\n      In about an hour after he had gone I distinctly felt the brig in\n      motion, and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly\n      commenced a voyage. Satisfied with this idea, I determined to\n      make my mind as easy as possible, and await the course of events\n      until I should be permitted to exchange the box for the more","roomy, although hardly more comfortable, accommodations of the\n      cabin. My first care was to get the watch. Leaving the taper\n      burning, I groped along in the dark, following the cord through\n      windings innumerable, in some of which I discovered that, after\n      toiling a long distance, I was brought back within a foot or two\n      of a former position. At length I reached the nail, and securing\n      the object of my journey, returned with it in safety. I now\n      looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided,\n      and selected the expedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of\r\nthe Columbia. With this I amused myself for some time, when,\n      growing sleepy, I extinguished the light with great care, and\n      soon fell into a sound slumber.\n\n      Upon awakening I felt strangely confused in mind, and some time\n      elapsed before I could bring to recollection all the various\n      circumstances of my situation. By degrees, however, I remembered\n      all. Striking a light, I looked at the watch; but it was run\n      down, and there were, consequently, no means of determining how\n      long I slept. My limbs were greatly cramped, and I was forced to\n      relieve them by standing between the crates. Presently feeling an\r\nalmost ravenous appetite, I bethought myself of the cold mutton,\n      some of which I had eaten just before going to sleep, and found\n      excellent. What was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a\n      state of absolute putrefaction! This circumstance occasioned me\n      great disquietude; for, connecting it with the disorder of mind I\n      experienced upon awakening, I began to suppose that I must have\n      slept for an inordinately long period of time. The close\n      atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this,\n      and might, in the end, be productive of the most serious results.","My head ached excessively; I fancied that I drew every breath\n      with difficulty; and, in short, I was oppressed with a multitude\n      of gloomy feelings. Still I could not venture to make any\n      disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound\n      up the watch, contented myself as well as possible.\n\n      Throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no\n      person came to my relief, and I could not help accusing Augustus\n      of the grossest inattention. What alarmed me chiefly was, that\n      the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint, and I was\r\nsuffering much from thirst, having eaten freely of the Bologna\n      sausages after the loss of my mutton. I became very uneasy, and\n      could no longer take any interest in my books. I was overpowered,\n      too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled at the thought of\n      indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious influence,\n      like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the hold.\n      In the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in\n      the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears\n      as if from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was\r\nblowing. I could not imagine a reason for the absence of\n      Augustus. We were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to\n      allow of my going up. Some accident might have happened to\n      him—but I could think of none which would account for his\n      suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except, indeed, his\n      having suddenly died or fallen overboard, and upon this idea I\n      could not dwell with any degree of patience. It was possible that\n      we had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near\n      vicinity of Nantucket. This notion, however, I was forced to","abandon; for such being the case, the brig must have frequently\n      gone about; and I was entirely satisfied, from her continual\n      inclination to the larboard, that she had been sailing all along\n      with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter. Besides, granting\n      that we were still in the neighborhood of the island, why should\n      not Augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance?\n      Pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and\n      cheerless condition, I resolved to wait yet another twenty-four\n      hours, when, if no relief were obtained, I would make my way to\r\nthe trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend,\n      or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a\n      further supply of water from the stateroom. While occupied with\n      this thought, however, I fell in spite of every exertion to the\n      contrary, into a state of profound sleep, or rather stupor. My\n      dreams were of the most terrific description. Every species of\n      calamity and horror befell me. Among other miseries I was\n      smothered to death between huge pillows, by demons of the most\n      ghastly and ferocious aspect. Immense serpents held me in their\r\nembrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully\n      shining eyes. Then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn\n      and awe-inspiring character, spread themselves out before me.\n      Immensely tall trunks of trees, gray and leafless, rose up in\n      endless succession as far as the eye could reach. Their roots\n      were concealed in wide-spreading morasses, whose dreary water lay\n      intensely black, still, and altogether terrible, beneath. And the\n      strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and waving to\n      and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters for","mercy, in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony\n      and despair. The scene changed; and I stood, naked and alone,\n      amidst the burning sand-plains of Sahara. At my feet lay crouched\n      a fierce lion of the tropics. Suddenly his wild eyes opened and\n      fell upon me. With a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet, and\n      laid bare his horrible teeth. In another instant there burst from\n      his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament, and I\n      fell impetuously to the earth. Stifling in a paroxysm of terror,\n      I at last found myself partially awake. My dream, then, was not\r\nall a dream. Now, at least, I was in possession of my senses. The\n      paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my\n      bosom—his hot breath was in my ear—and his white and ghastly\n      fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom.\n\n      Had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the\n      utterance of a syllable, I could have neither stirred nor spoken.\n      The beast, whatever it was, retained his position without\n      attempting any immediate violence, while I lay in an utterly\n      helpless, and, I fancied, a dying condition beneath him. I felt\r\nthat my powers of body and mind were fast leaving me—in a word,\n      that I was perishing, and perishing of sheer fright. My brain\n      swam—I grew deadly sick—my vision failed—even the glaring\n      eyeballs above me grew dim. Making a last strong effort, I at\n      length breathed a faint ejaculation to God, and resigned myself\n      to die. The sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent\n      fury of the animal. He precipitated himself at full length upon\n      my body; but what was my astonishment, when, with a long and low\n      whine, he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest","eagerness, and with the most extravagant demonstration of\n      affection and joy! I was bewildered, utterly lost in\n      amazement—but I could not forget the peculiar whine of my\n      Newfoundland dog Tiger, and the odd manner of his caresses I well\n      knew. It was he. I experienced a sudden rush of blood to my\n      temples—a giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and\n      reanimation. I rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which I had\n      been lying, and, throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful\n      follower and friend, relieved the long oppression of my bosom in\n      a flood of the most passionate tears.\r\nAs upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the\n      greatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress.\n      For a long time I found it nearly impossible to connect any\n      ideas; but, by very slow degrees, my thinking faculties returned,\n      and I again called to memory the several incidents of my\n      condition. For the presence of Tiger I tried in vain to account;\n      and after busying myself with a thousand different conjectures\n      respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing that\n      he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort\r\nby his caresses. Most people love their dogs—but for Tiger I had\n      an affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly,\n      did any creature more truly deserve it. For seven years he had\n      been my inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances\n      had given evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value\n      the animal. I had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of\n      a malignant little villain in Nantucket who was leading him, with\n      a rope around his neck, to the water; and the grown dog repaid\n      the obligation, about three years afterward, by saving me from","the bludgeon of a street robber.\n\n      Getting now hold of the watch, I found, upon applying it to my\n      ear, that it had again run down; but at this I was not at all\n      surprised, being convinced, from the peculiar state of my\n      feelings, that I had slept, as before, for a very long period of\n      time, how long, it was of course impossible to say. I was burning\n      up with fever, and my thirst was almost intolerable. I felt about\n      the box for my little remaining supply of water, for I had no\n      light, the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern, and\r\nthe phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand. Upon finding the\n      jug, however, I discovered it to be empty—Tiger, no doubt, having\n      been tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of\n      mutton, the bone of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the\n      box. The spoiled meat I could well spare, but my heart sank as I\n      thought of the water. I was feeble in the extreme—so much so that\n      I shook all over, as with an ague, at the slightest movement or\n      exertion. To add to my troubles, the brig was pitching and\n      rolling with great violence, and the oil-casks which lay upon my\r\nbox were in momentary danger of falling down, so as to block up\n      the only way of ingress or egress. I felt, also, terrible\n      sufferings from sea-sickness. These considerations determined me\n      to make my way, at all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate\n      relief, before I should be incapacitated from doing so\n      altogether. Having come to this resolve, I again felt about for\n      the phosphorus-box and tapers. The former I found after some\n      little trouble; but, not discovering the tapers as soon as I had\n      expected (for I remembered very nearly the spot in which I had","placed them), I gave up the search for the present, and bidding\n      Tiger lie quiet, began at once my journey toward the trap.\n\n      In this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever\n      apparent. It was with the utmost difficulty I could crawl along\n      at all, and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath\n      me; when, falling prostrate on my face, I would remain for some\n      minutes in a state bordering on insensibility. Still I struggled\n      forward by slow degrees, dreading every moment that I should\n      swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber, in\r\nwhich event I had nothing but death to expect as the result. At\n      length, upon making a push forward with all the energy I could\n      command, I struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner\n      of an iron-bound crate. The accident only stunned me for a few\n      moments; but I found, to my inexpressible grief, that the quick\n      and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely\n      across my path, so as effectually to block up the passage. With\n      my utmost exertions I could not move it a single inch from its\n      position, it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes\r\nand ship-furniture. It became necessary, therefore, enfeebled as\n      I was, either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out\n      a new passage, or to climb over the obstacle, and resume the path\n      on the other side. The former alternative presented too many\n      difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder. In\n      my present weak state of both mind and body, I should infallibly\n      lose my way if I attempted it, and perish miserably amid the\n      dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold. I proceeded,\n      therefore, without hesitation, to summon up all my remaining","strength and fortitude, and endeavour, as I best might, to\n      clamber over the crate.\n\n      Upon standing erect, with this end in view, I found the\n      undertaking even a more serious task than my fears had led me to\n      imagine. On each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall\n      of various heavy lumber, which the least blunder on my part might\n      be the means of bringing down upon my head; or, if this accident\n      did not occur, the path might be effectually blocked up against\n      my return by the descending mass, as it was in front by the\n      obstacle there. The crate itself was a long and unwieldy box,\r\nupon which no foothold could be obtained. In vain I attempted, by\n      every means in my power, to reach the top, with the hope of being\n      thus enabled to draw myself up. Had I succeeded in reaching it,\n      it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly\n      inadequate to the task of getting over, and it was better in\n      every respect that I failed. At length, in a desperate effort to\n      force the crate from its ground, I felt a strong vibration in the\n      side next me. I thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks,\n      and found that a very large one was loose. With my pocket-knife,\r\nwhich, luckily, I had with me, I succeeded, after great labour,\n      in prying it entirely off; and getting it through the aperture,\n      discovered, to my exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the\n      opposite side—in other words, that the top was wanting, it being\n      the bottom through which I had forced my way. I now met with no\n      important difficulty in proceeding along the line until I finally\n      reached the nail. With a beating heart I stood erect, and with a\n      gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap. It did not\n      rise as soon as I had expected, and I pressed it with somewhat","more determination, still dreading lest some other person than\n      Augustus might be in his state-room. The door, however, to my\n      astonishment, remained steady, and I became somewhat uneasy, for\n      I knew that it had formerly required but little or no effort to\n      remove it. I pushed it strongly—it was nevertheless firm: with\n      all my strength—it still did not give way: with rage, with fury,\n      with despair—it set at defiance my utmost efforts; and it was\n      evident, from the unyielding nature of the resistance, that the\n      hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up, or\r\nthat some immense weight had been placed upon it, which it was\n      useless to think of removing.\n\n      My sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay. In vain I\n      attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus\n      entombed. I could summon up no connected chain of reflection,\n      and, sinking on the floor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most\n      gloomy imaginings, in which the dreadful deaths of thirst,\n      famine, suffocation, and premature interment crowded upon me as\n      the prominent disasters to be encountered. At length there\n      returned to me some portion of presence of mind. I arose, and\r\nfelt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture.\n      Having found them, I examined them closely to ascertain if they\n      emitted any light from the state-room; but none was visible. I\n      then forced the blade of my pen-knife through them, until I met\n      with some hard obstacle. Scraping against it, I discovered it to\n      be a solid mass of iron, which, from its peculiar wavy feel as I\n      passed the blade along it, I concluded to be a chain-cable. The\n      only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box, and\n      there either yield to my sad fate, or try so to tranquilize my","mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape. I\n      immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after\n      innumerable difficulties, in getting back. As I sank, utterly\n      exhausted, upon the mattress, Tiger threw himself at full length\n      by my side, and seemed as if desirous, by his caresses, of\n      consoling me in my troubles, and urging me to bear them with\n      fortitude.\n\n      The singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my\n      attention. After licking my face and hands for some minutes, he\n      would suddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine. Upon\r\nreaching out my hand toward him, I then invariably found him\n      lying on his back, with his paws uplifted. This conduct, so\n      frequently repeated, appeared strange, and I could in no manner\n      account for it. As the dog seemed distressed, I concluded that he\n      had received some injury; and, taking his paws in my hands, I\n      examined them one by one, but found no sign of any hurt. I then\n      supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he\n      devoured with avidity—afterward, however, resuming his\n      extraordinary manoeuvres. I now imagined that he was suffering,\r\nlike myself, the torments of thirst, and was about adopting this\n      conclusion as the true one, when the idea occurred to me that I\n      had as yet only examined his paws, and that there might possibly\n      be a wound upon some portion of his body or head. The latter I\n      felt carefully over, but found nothing. On passing my hand,\n      however, along his back, I perceived a slight erection of the\n      hair extending completely across it. Probing this with my finger,\n      I discovered a string, and tracing it up, found that it encircled\n      the whole body. Upon a closer scrutiny, I came across a small","slip of what had the feeling of letter paper, through which the\n      string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it\n      immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\n      The thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note\n      from Augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having\n      happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had\n      devised this method of acquainting me with the true state of\n      affairs. Trembling with eagerness, I now commenced another search\n      for my phosphorus matches and tapers. I had a confused\n      recollection of having put them carefully away just before\r\nfalling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the\n      trap, I had been able to remember the exact spot where I had\n      deposited them. But now I endeavored in vain to call it to mind,\n      and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious\n      search for the missing articles; never, surely, was there a more\n      tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense. At length, while\n      groping about, with my head close to the ballast, near the\n      opening of the box, and outside of it, I perceived a faint\n      glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage. Greatly\r\nsurprised, I endeavored to make my way toward it, as it appeared\n      to be but a few feet from my position. Scarcely had I moved with\n      this intention, when I lost sight of the glimmer entirely, and,\n      before I could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel\n      along by the box until I had exactly resumed my original\n      situation. Now, moving my head with caution to and fro, I found\n      that, by proceeding slowly, with great care, in an opposite\n      direction to that in which I had at first started, I was enabled\n      to draw near the light, still keeping it in view. Presently I","came directly upon it (having squeezed my way through innumerable\n      narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from some fragments\n      of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side. I\n      was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell\n      upon two or three pieces of taper wax, which had been evidently\n      mumbled by the dog. I concluded at once that he had devoured the\n      whole of my supply of candles, and I felt hopeless of being ever\n      able to read the note of Augustus. The small remnants of the wax\n      were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel, that I\r\ndespaired of deriving any service from them, and left them as\n      they were. The phosphorus, of which there was only a speck or\n      two, I gathered up as well as I could, and returned with it,\n      after much difficulty, to my box, where Tiger had all the while\n      remained.\n\n      What to do next I could not tell. The hold was so intensely dark\n      that I could not see my hand, however close I would hold it to my\n      face. The white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not\n      even that when I looked at it directly; by turning the exterior\n      portions of the retina toward it—that is to say, by surveying it\r\nslightly askance, I found that it became in some measure\n      perceptible. Thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined, and the\n      note of my friend, if indeed it were a note from him, seemed only\n      likely to throw me into further trouble, by disquieting to no\n      purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind. In vain I\n      revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for\n      procuring light—such expedients precisely as a man in the\n      perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for\n      a similar purpose—each and all of which appear by turns to the","dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of\n      conceptions, just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties\n      flicker, alternately, one above the other. At last an idea\n      occurred to me which seemed rational, and which gave me cause to\n      wonder, very justly, that I had not entertained it before. I\n      placed the slip of paper on the back of a book, and, collecting\n      the fragments of the phosphorus matches which I had brought from\n      the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. I then, with the\n      palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly, yet steadily. A\r\nclear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole\n      surface; and had there been any writing upon it, I should not\n      have experienced the least difficulty, I am sure, in reading it.\n      Not a syllable was there, however—nothing but a dreary and\n      unsatisfactory blank; the illumination died away in a few\n      seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went.\n\n      I have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some\n      period prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on\n      idiocy. There were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect\r\nsanity, and, now and then, even of energy; but these were few. It\n      must be remembered that I had been, for many days certainly,\n      inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a\n      whaling vessel, and for a long portion of that time but scantily\n      supplied with water. For the last fourteen or fifteen hours I had\n      none—nor had I slept during that time. Salt provisions of the\n      most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed, since the loss\n      of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception of the\n      sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as they","were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched\n      condition of my throat. I was now in a high state of fever, and\n      in every respect exceedingly ill. This will account for the fact\n      that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last\n      adventure with the phosphorus, before the thought suggested\n      itself that I had examined only one side of the paper. I shall\n      not attempt to describe my feelings of rage (for I believe I was\n      more angry than any thing else) when the egregious oversight I\n      had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception. The blunder\r\nitself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and\n      impetuosity rendered it otherwise—in my disappointment at not\n      finding some words upon the slip, I had childishly torn it in\n      pieces and thrown it away, it was impossible to say where.\n\n      From the worst part of this dilemma I was relieved by the\n      sagacity of Tiger. Having got, after a long search, a small piece\n      of the note, I put it to the dog’s nose, and endeavored to make\n      him understand that he must bring me the rest of it. To my\n      astonishment, (for I had taught him none of the usual tricks for\r\nwhich his breed are famous,) he seemed to enter at once into my\n      meaning, and, rummaging about for a few moments, soon found\n      another considerable portion. Bringing me this, he paused awhile,\n      and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for\n      my approval of what he had done. I patted him on the head, when\n      he immediately made off again. It was now some minutes before he\n      came back—but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip,\n      which proved to be all the paper missing—it having been torn, it\n      seems, only into three pieces. Luckily, I had no trouble in","finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were left—being\n      guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still\n      emitted. My difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution,\n      and I now took time to reflect upon what I was about to do. It\n      was very probable, I considered, that some words were written\n      upon that side of the paper which had not been examined—but which\n      side was that? Fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in\n      this respect, although it assured me that the words (if there\n      were any) would be found all on one side, and connected in a\r\nproper manner, as written. There was the greater necessity of\n      ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt, as the\n      phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third\n      attempt, should I fail in the one I was now about to make. I\n      placed the paper on a book as before, and sat for some minutes\n      thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind. At last I\n      thought it barely possible that the written side might have some\n      unevenness on its surface, which a delicate sense of feeling\n      might enable me to detect. I determined to make the experiment\n      and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first\r\npresented itself. Nothing, however, was perceptible, and I turned\n      the paper, adjusting it on the book. I now again carried my\n      forefinger cautiously along, when I was aware of an exceedingly\n      slight, but still discernable glow, which followed as it\n      proceeded. This, I knew, must arise from some very minute\n      remaining particles of the phosphorus with which I had covered\n      the paper in my previous attempt. The other, or under side, then,\n      was that on which lay the writing, if writing there should\n      finally prove to be. Again I turned the note, and went to work as","I had previously done. Having rubbed in the phosphorus, a\n      brilliancy ensued as before—but this time several lines of MS. in\n      a large hand, and apparently in red ink, became distinctly\n      visible. The glimmer, although sufficiently bright, was but\n      momentary. Still, had I not been too greatly excited, there would\n      have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three\n      sentences before me—for I saw there were three. In my anxiety,\n      however, to read all at once, I succeeded only in reading the\n      seven concluding words, which thus appeared—“blood—your life\r\ndepends upon lying close.”\n\n      Had I been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note—the\n      full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted\n      to convey, that admonition, even although it should have revealed\n      a story of disaster the most unspeakable, could not, I am firmly\n      convinced, have imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing\n      and yet indefinable horror with which I was inspired by the\n      fragmentary warning thus received. And “blood,” too, that word of\n      all words—so rife at all times with mystery, and suffering, and\r\nterror—how trebly full of import did it now appear—how chilly and\n      heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from any foregoing words to\n      qualify or render it distinct) did its vague syllables fall, amid\n      the deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost recesses of my\n      soul!\n\n      Augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain\n      concealed, and I formed a thousand surmises as to what they could\n      be—but I could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution\n      of the mystery. Just after returning from my last journey to the\n      trap, and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the","singular conduct of Tiger, I had come to the resolution of making\n      myself heard at all events by those on board, or, if I could not\n      succeed in this directly, of trying to cut my way through the\n      orlop deck. The half certainty which I felt of being able to\n      accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency, had\n      given me courage (which I should not otherwise have had) to\n      endure the evils of my situation. The few words I had been able\n      to read, however, had cut me off from these final resources, and\n      I now, for the first time, felt all the misery of my fate. In a\r\nparoxysm of despair I threw myself again upon the mattress,\n      where, for about the period of a day and night, I lay in a kind\n      of stupor, relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and\n      recollection.\n\n      At length I once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon\n      the horrors which encompassed me. For another twenty-four hours\n      it was barely possible that I might exist without water—for a\n      longer time I could not do so. During the first portion of my\n      imprisonment I had made free use of the cordials with which\n      Augustus had supplied me, but they only served to excite fever,\r\nwithout in the least degree assuaging thirst. I had now only\n      about a gill left, and this was of a species of strong peach\n      liqueur at which my stomach revolted. The sausages were entirely\n      consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the\n      skin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had\n      been eaten by Tiger. To add to my troubles, I found that my\n      headache was increasing momentarily, and with it the species of\n      delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first\n      falling asleep. For some hours past it had been with the greatest","difficulty I could breathe at all, and now each attempt at so\n      doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic action of\n      the chest. But there was still another and very different source\n      of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose harassing terrors had been\n      the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the\n      mattress. It arose from the demeanor of the dog.\n\n      I first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in\n      the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt. As I rubbed, he\n      ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too\r\ngreatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the\n      circumstance. Soon afterward, it will be remembered, I threw\n      myself on the mattress, and fell into a species of lethargy.\n      Presently I became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my\n      ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was panting\n      and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his\n      eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. I spoke to him,\n      when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet.\n      Presently I relapsed into my stupor, from which I was again\n      awakened in a similar manner. This was repeated three or four\r\ntimes, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a\n      degree of fear, that I became fully aroused. He was now lying\n      close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a\n      kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly\n      convulsed. I had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the\n      confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at\n      a loss what course to pursue. I could not endure the thought of\n      killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own\n      safety. I could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me","with an expression of the most deadly animosity, and I expected\n      every instant that he would attack me. At last I could endure my\n      terrible situation no longer, and determined to make my way from\n      the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition\n      should render it necessary for me to do so. To get out, I had to\n      pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate\n      my design—missing himself upon his fore-legs (as I perceived by\n      the altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his\n      white fangs, which were easily discernible. I took the remains of\r\nthe ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured\n      them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which\n      Augustus had left me—then, folding my cloak around me as closely\n      as possible, I made a movement toward the mouth of the box. No\n      sooner did I do this, than the dog sprang with a loud growl\n      toward my throat. The whole weight of his body struck me on the\n      right shoulder, and I fell violently to the left, while the\n      enraged animal passed entirely over me. I had fallen upon my\n      knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these\r\nprotected me from a second furious assault, during which I felt\n      the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which\n      enveloped my neck—yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate\n      all the folds. I was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would\n      place me completely in his power. Despair gave me strength, and I\n      rose boldly up, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging\n      with me the blankets from the mattress. These I now threw over\n      him, and before he could extricate himself, I had got through the\n      door and closed it effectually against his pursuit. In this","struggle, however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of\n      ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to\n      a single gill of liqueur. As this reflection crossed my mind, I\n      felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which\n      might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar\n      circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it\n      to the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor.\n\n      Scarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when I heard my\n      name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the\r\ndirection of the steerage. So unexpected was anything of the\n      kind, and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the\n      sound, that I endeavoured in vain to reply. My powers of speech\n      totally failed, and in an agony of terror lest my friend should\n      conclude me dead, and return without attempting to reach me, I\n      stood up between the crates near the door of the box, trembling\n      convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance. Had a\n      thousand words depended upon a syllable, I could not have spoken\n      it. There was a slight movement now audible among the lumber\r\nsomewhere forward of my station. The sound presently grew less\n      distinct, then again less so, and still less. Shall I ever forget\n      my feelings at this moment? He was going—my friend, my companion,\n      from whom I had a right to expect so much—he was going—he would\n      abandon me—he was gone! He would leave me to perish miserably, to\n      expire in the most horrible and loathesome of dungeons—and one\n      word, one little syllable, would save me—yet that single syllable\n      I could not utter! I felt, I am sure, more than ten thousand\n      times the agonies of death itself. My brain reeled, and I fell,","deadly sick, against the end of the box.\n\n      As I fell the carving-knife was shaken out from the waist-band of\n      my pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor.\n      Never did any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my\n      ears! With the intensest anxiety I listened to ascertain the\n      effect of the noise upon Augustus—for I knew that the person who\n      called my name could be no one but himself. All was silent for\n      some moments. At length I again heard the word “Arthur!” repeated\n      in a low tone, and one full of hesitation. Reviving hope loosened\r\nat once my powers of speech, and I now screamed at the top of my\n      voice, “Augustus! oh, Augustus!” “Hush! for God’s sake be\n      silent!” he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; “I will\n      be with you immediately—as soon as I can make my way through the\n      hold.” For a long time I heard him moving among the lumber, and\n      every moment seemed to me an age. At length I felt his hand upon\n      my shoulder, and he placed, at the same moment, a bottle of water\n      to my lips. Those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the\n      jaws of the tomb, or who have known the insufferable torments of\r\nthirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which\n      encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the\n      unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest\n      of all physical luxuries afforded.\n\n      When I had in some degree satisfied my thirst, Augustus produced\n      from his pocket three or four boiled potatoes, which I devoured\n      with the greatest avidity. He had brought with him a light in a\n      dark lantern, and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less\n      comfort than the food and drink. But I was impatient to learn the\n      cause of his protracted absence, and he proceeded to recount what","had happened on board during my incarceration.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\n      The brig put to sea, as I had supposed, in about an hour after he\n      had left the watch. This was on the twentieth of June. It will be\n      remembered that I had then been in the hold for three days; and,\n      during this period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and\n      so much running to and fro, especially in the cabin and\n      staterooms, that he had had no chance of visiting me without the\n      risk of having the secret of the trap discovered. When at length\n      he did come, I had assured him that I was doing as well as\r\npossible; and, therefore, for the two next days he felt but\n      little uneasiness on my account—still, however, watching an\n      opportunity of going down. It was not until the fourth day that\n      he found one. Several times during this interval he had made up\n      his mind to let his father know of the adventure, and have me\n      come up at once; but we were still within reaching distance of\n      Nantucket, and it was doubtful, from some expressions which had\n      escaped Captain Barnard, whether he would not immediately put\n      back if he discovered me to be on board. Besides, upon thinking\r\nthe matter over, Augustus, so he told me, could not imagine that\n      I was in immediate want, or that I would hesitate, in such case,\n      to make myself heard at the trap. When, therefore, he considered\n      everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with\n      an opportunity of visiting me unobserved. This, as I said before,\n      did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the\n      watch, and the seventh since I had first entered the hold. He\n      then went down without taking with him any water or provisions,\n      intending in the first place merely to call my attention, and get","me to come from the box to the trap,—when he would go up to the\n      stateroom and thence hand me down a supply. When he descended for\n      this purpose he found that I was asleep, for it seems that I was\n      snoring very loudly. From all the calculations I can make on the\n      subject, this must have been the slumber into which I fell just\n      after my return from the trap with the watch, and which,\n      consequently, must have lasted for more than three entire days\n      and nights at the very least. Latterly, I have had reason both\n      from my own experience and the assurance of others, to be\r\nacquainted with the strong soporific effects of the stench\n      arising from old fish-oil when closely confined; and when I think\n      of the condition of the hold in which I was imprisoned, and the\n      long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling\n      vessel, I am more inclined to wonder that I awoke at all, after\n      once falling asleep, than that I should have slept\n      uninterruptedly for the period specified above.\n\n      Augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing\n      the trap—but I made him no reply. He then shut the trap, and\n      spoke to me in a louder, and finally in a very loud tone—still I\r\ncontinued to snore. He was now at a loss what to do. It would\n      take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box,\n      and in the meanwhile his absence would be noticed by Captain\n      Barnard, who had occasion for his services every minute, in\n      arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the\n      voyage. He determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and\n      await another opportunity of visiting me. He was the more easily\n      induced to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most\n      tranquil nature, and he could not suppose that I had undergone","any inconvenience from my incarceration. He had just made up his\n      mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an\n      unusual bustle, the sound of which proceeded apparently from the\n      cabin. He sprang through the trap as quickly as possible, closed\n      it, and threw open the door of his stateroom. No sooner had he\n      put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his\n      face, and he was knocked down, at the same moment, by a blow from\n      a handspike.\n\n      A strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp\n      upon his throat; still he was able to see what was going on\r\naround him. His father was tied hand and foot, and lying along\n      the steps of the companion-way, with his head down, and a deep\n      wound in the forehead, from which the blood was flowing in a\n      continued stream. He spoke not a word, and was apparently dying.\n      Over him stood the first mate, eyeing him with an expression of\n      fiendish derision, and deliberately searching his pockets, from\n      which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer.\n      Seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were\n      rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they\r\nsoon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition. Besides\n      Augustus and Captain Barnard, there were nine men altogether in\n      the cabin, and these among the most ruffianly of the brig’s\n      company. The villains now went upon deck, taking my friend with\n      them after having secured his arms behind his back. They\n      proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was fastened down—two\n      of the mutineers standing by it with axes—two also at the main\n      hatch. The mate called out in a loud voice: “Do you hear there\n      below? tumble up with you, one by one—now, mark that—and no","grumbling!” It was some minutes before any one appeared:—at last\n      an Englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping\n      piteously, and entreating the mate, in the most humble manner, to\n      spare his life. The only reply was a blow on the forehead from an\n      axe. The poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan, and the\n      black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child, and\n      tossed him deliberately into the sea. Hearing the blow and the\n      plunge of the body, the men below could now be induced to venture\n      on deck neither by threats nor promises, until a proposition was\r\nmade to smoke them out. A general rush then ensued, and for a\n      moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken. The\n      mutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the forecastle\n      effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up.\n      These six, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without\n      arms, submitted after a brief struggle. The mate gave them fair\n      words—no doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for\n      they had no difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck. The\n      result proved his sagacity, no less than his diabolical villainy.\r\nAll in the forecastle presently signified their intention of\n      submitting, and, ascending one by one, were pinioned and then\n      thrown on their backs, together with the first six—there being in\n      all, of the crew who were not concerned in the mutiny,\n      twenty-seven.\n\n      A scene of the most horrible butchery ensued. The bound seamen\n      were dragged to the gangway. Here the cook stood with an axe,\n      striking each victim on the head as he was forced over the side\n      of the vessel by the other mutineers. In this manner twenty-two\n      perished, and Augustus had given himself up for lost, expecting","every moment his own turn to come next. But it seemed that the\n      villains were now either weary, or in some measure disgusted with\n      their bloody labour; for the four remaining prisoners, together\n      with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck with the rest,\n      were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the whole\n      murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until\n      sunset. They now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the\n      survivors, who lay not more than four paces off, and could\n      distinguish every word said. Upon some of the mutineers the\r\nliquor appeared to have a softening effect, for several voices\n      were heard in favor of releasing the captives altogether, on\n      condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits. The\n      black cook, however (who in all respects was a perfect demon, and\n      who seemed to exert as much influence, if not more, than the mate\n      himself), would listen to no proposition of the kind, and rose\n      repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway.\n      Fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be\n      easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party, among\r\nwhom was a line-manager, who went by the name of Dirk Peters.\n      This man was the son of an Indian squaw of the tribe of\n      Upsarokas, who live among the fastnesses of the Black Hills, near\n      the source of the Missouri. His father was a fur-trader, I\n      believe, or at least connected in some manner with the Indian\n      trading-posts on Lewis river. Peters himself was one of the most\n      ferocious-looking men I ever beheld. He was short in stature, not\n      more than four feet eight inches high, but his limbs were of\n      Herculean mould. His hands, especially, were so enormously thick","and broad as hardly to retain a human shape. His arms, as well as\n      legs, were bowed in the most singular manner, and appeared to\n      possess no flexibility whatever. His head was equally deformed,\n      being of immense size, with an indentation on the crown (like\n      that on the head of most negroes), and entirely bald. To conceal\n      this latter deficiency, which did not proceed from old age, he\n      usually wore a wig formed of any hair-like material which\n      presented itself—occasionally the skin of a Spanish dog or\n      American grizzly bear. At the time spoken of, he had on a portion\r\nof one of these bearskins; and it added no little to the natural\n      ferocity of his countenance, which betook of the Upsaroka\n      character. The mouth extended nearly from ear to ear, the lips\n      were thin, and seemed, like some other portions of his frame, to\n      be devoid of natural pliancy, so that the ruling expression never\n      varied under the influence of any emotion whatever. This ruling\n      expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth\n      were exceedingly long and protruding, and never even partially\n      covered, in any instance, by the lips. To pass this man with a\r\ncasual glance, one might imagine him to be convulsed with\n      laughter, but a second look would induce a shuddering\n      acknowledgment, that if such an expression were indicative of\n      merriment, the merriment must be that of a demon. Of this\n      singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring\n      men of Nantucket. These anecdotes went to prove his prodigious\n      strength when under excitement, and some of them had given rise\n      to a doubt of his sanity. But on board the Grampus, it seems, he\n      was regarded, at the time of the mutiny, with feelings more of\n      derision than of anything else. I have been thus particular in","speaking of Dirk Peters, because, ferocious as he appeared, he\n      proved the main instrument in preserving the life of Augustus,\n      and because I shall have frequent occasion to mention him\n      hereafter in the course of my narrative—a narrative, let me here\n      say, which, in its latter portions, will be found to include\n      incidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human\n      experience, and for this reason so far beyond the limits of human\n      credulity, that I proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining\n      credence for all that I shall tell, yet confidently trusting in\r\ntime and progressing science to verify some of the most important\n      and most improbable of my statements.\n\n      After much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was\n      determined at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of\n      Augustus, whom Peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping\n      as his clerk) should be set adrift in one of the smallest\n      whaleboats. The mate went down into the cabin to see if Captain\n      Barnard was still living—for, it will be remembered, he was left\n      below when the mutineers came up. Presently the two made their\r\nappearance, the captain pale as death, but somewhat recovered\n      from the effects of his wound. He spoke to the men in a voice\n      hardly articulate, entreated them not to set him adrift, but to\n      return to their duty, and promising to land them wherever they\n      chose, and to take no steps for bringing them to justice. He\n      might as well have spoken to the winds. Two of the ruffians\n      seized him by the arms and hurled him over the brig’s side into\n      the boat, which had been lowered while the mate went below. The\n      four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and ordered","to follow, which they did without attempting any\n      resistance—Augustus being still left in his painful position,\n      although he struggled and prayed only for the poor satisfaction\n      of being permitted to bid his father farewell. A handful of\n      sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed down; but neither\n      mast, sail, oar, nor compass. The boat was towed astern for a few\n      minutes, during which the mutineers held another consultation—it\n      was then finally cut adrift. By this time night had come on—there\n      were neither moon nor stars visible—and a short and ugly sea was\r\nrunning, although there was no great deal of wind. The boat was\n      instantly out of sight, and little hope could be entertained for\n      the unfortunate sufferers who were in it. This event happened,\n      however, in latitude 35 degrees 30’ north, longitude 61 degrees\n      20’ west, and consequently at no very great distance from the\n      Bermuda Islands. Augustus therefore endeavored to console himself\n      with the idea that the boat might either succeed in reaching the\n      land, or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by vessels\n      off the coast.\n\n      All sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her\r\noriginal course to the southwest—the mutineers being bent upon\n      some piratical expedition, in which, from all that could be\n      understood, a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the Cape\n      Verd Islands to Porto Rico. No attention was paid to Augustus,\n      who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the\n      cabin companion-way. Dirk Peters treated him with some degree of\n      kindness, and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the\n      cook. His situation was still one of the most precarious, as the\n      men were continually intoxicated, and there was no relying upon","their continued good-humor or carelessness in regard to himself.\n      His anxiety on my account he represented, however, as the most\n      distressing result of his condition; and, indeed, I had never\n      reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship. More than once\n      he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my\n      being on board, but was restrained from so doing, partly through\n      recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld, and partly\n      through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief. For the\n      latter purpose he was constantly on the watch; but, in spite of\r\nthe most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after the boat\n      was cut adrift before any chance occurred. At length, on the\n      night of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the\n      eastward, and all hands were called up to take in sail. During\n      the confusion which ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and\n      into the stateroom. What was his grief and horror in discovering\n      that the latter had been rendered a place of deposit for a\n      variety of sea-stores and ship-furniture, and that several\n      fathoms of old chain-cable, which had been stowed away beneath\r\nthe companion-ladder, had been dragged thence to make room for a\n      chest, and were now lying immediately upon the trap! To remove it\n      without discovery was impossible, and he returned on deck as\n      quickly as he could. As he came up, the mate seized him by the\n      throat, and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin, was\n      about flinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was\n      again preserved through the interference of Dirk Peters. Augustus\n      was now put in handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on\n      board), and his feet lashed tightly together. He was then taken","into the steerage, and thrown into a lower berth next to the\n      forecastle bulkheads, with the assurance that he should never put\n      his foot on deck again “until the brig was no longer a brig.”\n      This was the expression of the cook, who threw him into the\n      berth—it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended\n      by the phrase. The whole affair, however, proved the ultimate\n      means of my relief, as will presently appear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\n      For some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle, Augustus\n      abandoned himself to despair, never hoping to leave the berth\r\nalive. He now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of\n      the men who should come down with my situation, thinking it\n      better to let me take my chance with the mutineers than perish of\n      thirst in the hold,—for it had been ten days since I was first\n      imprisoned, and my jug of water was not a plentiful supply even\n      for four. As he was thinking on this subject, the idea came all\n      at once into his head that it might be possible to communicate\n      with me by the way of the main hold. In any other circumstances,\n      the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have prevented\r\nhim from attempting it; but now he had, at all events, little\n      prospect of life, and consequently little to lose, he bent his\n      whole mind, therefore, upon the task.\n\n      His handcuffs were the first consideration. At first he saw no\n      method of removing them, and feared that he should thus be\n      baffled in the very outset; but upon a closer scrutiny he\n      discovered that the irons could be slipped off and on at\n      pleasure, with very little effort or inconvenience, merely by\n      squeezing his hands through them,—this species of manacle being\n      altogether ineffectual in confining young persons, in whom the","smaller bones readily yield to pressure. He now untied his feet,\n      and, leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be\n      readjusted in the event of any person’s coming down, proceeded to\n      examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth. The partition\n      here was of soft pine board, an inch thick, and he saw that he\n      should have little trouble in cutting his way through. A voice\n      was now heard at the forecastle companion-way, and he had just\n      time to put his right hand into its handcuff (the left had not\n      been removed) and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his\r\nankle, when Dirk Peters came below, followed by Tiger, who\n      immediately leaped into the berth and lay down. The dog had been\n      brought on board by Augustus, who knew my attachment to the\n      animal, and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me\n      during the voyage. He went up to our house for him immediately\n      after first taking me into the hold, but did not think of\n      mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch. Since\n      the mutiny, Augustus had not seen him before his appearance with\n      Dirk Peters, and had given him up for lost, supposing him to have\r\nbeen thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging\n      to the mate’s gang. It appeared afterward that he had crawled\n      into a hole beneath a whale-boat, from which, not having room to\n      turn round, he could not extricate himself. Peters at last let\n      him out, and, with a species of good feeling which my friend knew\n      well how to appreciate, had now brought him to him in the\n      forecastle as a companion, leaving at the same time some salt\n      junk and potatoes, with a can of water, he then went on deck,\n      promising to come down with something more to eat on the next","day.\n\n      When he had gone, Augustus freed both hands from the manacles and\n      unfastened his feet. He then turned down the head of the mattress\n      on which he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the\n      ruffians had not thought it worth while to search him) commenced\n      cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks, as closely\n      as possible to the floor of the berth. He chose to cut here,\n      because, if suddenly interrupted, he would be able to conceal\n      what had been done by letting the head of the mattress fall into\n      its proper position. For the remainder of the day, however, no\r\ndisturbance occurred, and by night he had completely divided the\n      plank. It should here be observed that none of the crew occupied\n      the forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the\n      cabin since the mutiny, drinking the wines and feasting on the\n      sea-stores of Captain Barnard, and giving no more heed than was\n      absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig. These\n      circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and Augustus; for,\n      had matters been otherwise, he would have found it impossible to\n      reach me. As it was, he proceeded with confidence in his design.\r\nIt was near daybreak, however, before he completed the second\n      division of the board (which was about a foot above the first\n      cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his\n      passage through with facility to the main orlop deck. Having got\n      here, he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main\n      hatch, although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of\n      oil-casks piled nearly as high as the upper deck, there being\n      barely room enough left for his body. Upon reaching the hatch he\n      found that Tiger had followed him below, squeezing between two","rows of the casks. It was now too late, however, to attempt\n      getting to me before dawn, as the chief difficulty lay in passing\n      through the close stowage in the lower hold. He therefore\n      resolved to return, and wait till the next night. With this\n      design, he proceeded to loosen the hatch, so that he might have\n      as little detention as possible when he should come again. No\n      sooner had he loosened it than Tiger sprang eagerly to the small\n      opening produced, snuffed for a moment, and then uttered a long\n      whine, scratching at the same time, as if anxious to remove the\r\ncovering with his paws. There could be no doubt, from his\n      behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and\n      Augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me\n      if he put him down. He now hit upon the expedient of sending the\n      note, as it was especially desirable that I should make no\n      attempt at forcing my way out at least under existing\n      circumstances, and there could be no certainty of his getting to\n      me himself on the morrow as he intended. After-events proved how\n      fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did; for,\r\nhad it not been for the receipt of the note, I should undoubtedly\n      have fallen upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the\n      crew, and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed\n      in consequence.\n\n      Having concluded to write, the difficulty was now to procure the\n      materials for so doing. An old toothpick was soon made into a\n      pen; and this by means of feeling altogether, for the\n      between-decks was as dark as pitch. Paper enough was obtained\n      from the back of a letter—a duplicate of the forged letter from\n      Mr. Ross. This had been the original draught; but the handwriting","not being sufficiently well imitated, Augustus had written\n      another, thrusting the first, by good fortune, into his\n      coat-pocket, where it was now most opportunely discovered. Ink\n      alone was thus wanting, and a substitute was immediately found\n      for this by means of a slight incision with the pen-knife on the\n      back of a finger just above the nail—a copious flow of blood\n      ensuing, as usual, from wounds in that vicinity. The note was now\n      written, as well as it could be in the dark and under the\n      circumstances. It briefly explained that a mutiny had taken\r\nplace; that Captain Barnard was set adrift; and that I might\n      expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned, but\n      must not venture upon making any disturbance. It concluded with\n      these words: “_I have scrawled this with blood—your life depends\n      upon lying close._”\n\n      This slip of paper being tied upon the dog, he was now put down\n      the hatchway, and Augustus made the best of his way back to the\n      forecastle, where he found no reason to believe that any of the\n      crew had been in his absence. To conceal the hole in the\n      partition, he drove his knife in just above it, and hung up a\r\npea-jacket which he found in the berth. His handcuffs were then\n      replaced, and also the rope around his ankles.\n\n      These arrangements were scarcely completed when Dirk Peters came\n      below, very drunk, but in excellent humour, and bringing with him\n      my friend’s allowance of provision for the day. This consisted of\n      a dozen large Irish potatoes roasted, and a pitcher of water. He\n      sat for some time on a chest by the berth, and talked freely\n      about the mate and the general concerns of the brig. His\n      demeanour was exceedingly capricious, and even grotesque. At one","time Augustus was much alarmed by odd conduct. At last, however,\n      he went on deck, muttering a promise to bring his prisoner a good\n      dinner on the morrow. During the day two of the crew (harpooners)\n      came down, accompanied by the cook, all three in nearly the last\n      stage of intoxication. Like Peters, they made no scruple of\n      talking unreservedly about their plans. It appeared that they\n      were much divided among themselves as to their ultimate course,\n      agreeing in no point, except the attack on the ship from the Cape\n      Verd Islands, with which they were in hourly expectation of\r\nmeeting. As far as could be ascertained, the mutiny had not been\n      brought about altogether for the sake of booty; a private pique\n      of the chief mate’s against Captain Barnard having been the main\n      instigation. There now seemed to be two principal factions among\n      the crew—one headed by the mate, the other by the cook. The\n      former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel which\n      should present itself, and equipping it at some of the West India\n      Islands for a piratical cruise. The latter division, however,\n      which was the stronger, and included Dirk Peters among its\r\npartisans, were bent upon pursuing the course originally laid out\n      for the brig into the South Pacific; there either to take whale,\n      or act otherwise, as circumstances should suggest. The\n      representations of Peters, who had frequently visited these\n      regions, had great weight, apparently, with the mutineers,\n      wavering, as they were, between half-engendered notions of profit\n      and pleasure. He dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to\n      be found among the innumerable islands of the Pacific, on the\n      perfect security and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed,","but, more particularly, on the deliciousness of the climate, on\n      the abundant means of good living, and on the voluptuous beauty\n      of the women. As yet, nothing had been absolutely determined\n      upon; but the pictures of the hybrid line-manager were taking\n      strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen, and there\n      was every possibility that his intentions would be finally\n      carried into effect.\n\n      The three men went away in about an hour, and no one else entered\n      the forecastle all day. Augustus lay quiet until nearly night. He\n      then freed himself from the rope and irons, and prepared for his\r\nattempt. A bottle was found in one of the berths, and this he\n      filled with water from the pitcher left by Peters, storing his\n      pockets at the same time with cold potatoes. To his great joy he\n      also came across a lantern, with a small piece of tallow candle\n      in it. This he could light at any moment, as he had in his\n      possession a box of phosphorus matches. When it was quite dark,\n      he got through the hole in the bulkhead, having taken the\n      precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey\n      the idea of a person covered up. When through, he hung up the\r\npea-jacket on his knife, as before, to conceal the aperture—this\n      manoeuvre being easily effected, as he did not readjust the piece\n      of plank taken out until afterward. He was now on the main orlop\n      deck, and proceeded to make his way, as before, between the upper\n      deck and the oil-casks to the main hatchway. Having reached this,\n      he lit the piece of candle, and descended, groping with extreme\n      difficulty among the compact stowage of the hold. In a few\n      moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench and the\n      closeness of the atmosphere. He could not think it possible that","I had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so\n      oppressive an air. He called my name repeatedly, but I made him\n      no reply, and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed. The\n      brig was rolling violently, and there was so much noise in\n      consequence, that it was useless to listen for any weak sound,\n      such as those of my breathing or snoring. He threw open the\n      lantern, and held it as high as possible, whenever an opportunity\n      occurred, in order that, by observing the light, I might, if\n      alive, be aware that succor was approaching. Still nothing was\r\nheard from me, and the supposition of my death began to assume\n      the character of certainty. He determined, nevertheless, to force\n      a passage, if possible, to the box, and at least ascertain beyond\n      a doubt the truth of his surmises. He pushed on for some time in\n      a most pitiable state of anxiety, until, at length, he found the\n      pathway utterly blocked up, and that there was no possibility of\n      making any farther way by the course in which he had set out.\n      Overcome now by his feelings, he threw himself among the lumber\n      in despair, and wept like a child. It was at this period that he\r\nheard the crash occasioned by the bottle which I had thrown down.\n      Fortunate, indeed, was it that the incident occurred—for, upon\n      this incident, trivial as it appears, the thread of my destiny\n      depended. Many years elapsed, however, before I was aware of this\n      fact. A natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision\n      prevented Augustus from confiding to me at once what a more\n      intimate and unreserved communion afterward induced him to\n      reveal. Upon finding his further progress in the hold impeded by\n      obstacles which he could not overcome, he had resolved to abandon","his attempt at reaching me, and return at once to the forecastle.\n      Before condemning him entirely on this head, the harassing\n      circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken into\n      consideration. The night was fast wearing away, and his absence\n      from the forecastle might be discovered; and indeed would\n      necessarily be so, if he should fail to get back to the berth by\n      daybreak. His candle was expiring in the socket, and there would\n      be the greatest difficulty in retracing his way to the hatchway\n      in the dark. It must be allowed, too, that he had every good\r\nreason to believe me dead; in which event no benefit could result\n      to me from his reaching the box, and a world of danger would be\n      encountered to no purpose by himself. He had repeatedly called,\n      and I had made him no answer. I had been now eleven days and\n      nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he\n      had left with me—a supply which it was not at all probable I had\n      hoarded in the beginning of my confinement, as I had every cause\n      to expect a speedy release. The atmosphere of the hold, too, must\n      have appeared to him, coming from the comparatively open air of\r\nthe steerage, of a nature absolutely poisonous, and by far more\n      intolerable than it had seemed to me upon my first taking up my\n      quarters in the box—the hatchways at that time having been\n      constantly open for many months previous. Add to these\n      considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so\n      lately witnessed by my friend; his confinement, privations, and\n      narrow escapes from death, together with the frail and equivocal\n      tenure by which he still existed—circumstances all so well\n      calculated to prostrate every energy of mind—and the reader will","be easily brought, as I have been, to regard his apparent falling\n      off in friendship and in faith with sentiments rather of sorrow\n      than of anger.\n\n      The crash of the bottle was distinctly heard, yet Augustus was\n      not sure that it proceeded from the hold. The doubt, however, was\n      sufficient inducement to persevere. He clambered up nearly to the\n      orlop deck by means of the stowage, and then, watching for a lull\n      in the pitchings of the vessel, he called out to me in as loud a\n      tone as he could command, regardless, for the moment, of being\n      overheard by the crew. It will be remembered that on this\r\noccasion the voice reached me, but I was so entirely overcome by\n      violent agitation as to be incapable of reply. Confident, now,\n      that his worst apprehensions were well founded, he descended,\n      with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss of\n      time. In his haste some small boxes were thrown down, the noise\n      occasioned by which I heard, as will be recollected. He had made\n      considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife\n      again caused him to hesitate. He retraced his steps immediately,\n      and, clambering up the stowage a second time, called out my name,\r\nloudly as before, having watched for a lull. This time I found\n      voice to answer. Overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive,\n      he now resolved to brave every difficulty and danger in reaching\n      me. Having extricated himself as quickly as possible from the\n      labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed in, he at length\n      struck into an opening which promised better, and finally, after\n      a series of struggles, arrived at the box in a state of utter\n      exhaustion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\n      The leading particulars of this narration were all that Augustus\n      communicated to me while we remained near the box. It was not","until afterward that he entered fully into all the details. He\n      was apprehensive of being missed, and I was wild with impatience\n      to leave my detested place of confinement. We resolved to make\n      our way at once to the hole in the bulkhead, near which I was to\n      remain for the present, while he went through to reconnoiter. To\n      leave Tiger in the box was what neither of us could endure to\n      think of, yet, how to act otherwise was the question. He now\n      seemed to be perfectly quiet, and we could not even distinguish\n      the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely to the\r\nbox. I was convinced that he was dead, and determined to open the\n      door. We found him lying at full length, apparently in a deep\n      stupor, yet still alive. No time was to be lost, yet I could not\n      bring myself to abandon an animal who had now been twice\n      instrumental in saving my life, without some attempt at\n      preserving him. We therefore dragged him along with us as well as\n      we could, although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue;\n      Augustus, during part of the time, being forced to clamber over\n      the impediments in our way with the huge dog in his arms—a feat\r\nto which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally\n      inadequate. At length we succeeded in reaching the hole, when\n      Augustus got through, and Tiger was pushed in afterward. All was\n      found to be safe, and we did not fail to return sincere thanks to\n      God for our deliverance from the imminent danger we had escaped.\n      For the present, it was agreed that I should remain near the\n      opening, through which my companion could readily supply me with\n      a part of his daily provision, and where I could have the\n      advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure.\n\n      In explanation of some portions of this narrative, wherein I have","spoken of the stowage of the brig, and which may appear ambiguous\n      to some of my readers who may have seen a proper or regular\n      stowage, I must here state that the manner in which this most\n      important duty had been performed on board the Grampus was a most\n      shameful piece of neglect on the part of Captain Barnard, who was\n      by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman as the\n      hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would\n      seem necessarily to demand. A proper stowage cannot be\n      accomplished in a careless manner, and many most disastrous\r\naccidents, even within the limits of my own experience, have\n      arisen from neglect or ignorance in this particular. Coasting\n      vessels, in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking\n      in or discharging cargo, are the most liable to mishap from the\n      want of a proper attention to stowage. The great point is to\n      allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting position\n      even in the most violent rollings of the vessel. With this end,\n      great attention must be paid, not only to the bulk taken in, but\n      to the nature of the bulk, and whether there be a full or only a\r\npartial cargo. In most kinds of freight the stowage is\n      accomplished by means of a screw. Thus, in a load of tobacco or\n      flour, the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the\n      vessel that the barrels or hogsheads, upon discharging, are found\n      to be completely flattened, and take some time to regain their\n      original shape. This screwing, however, is resorted to\n      principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold; for\n      in a full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco, there\n      can be no danger of any shifting whatever, at least none from","which inconvenience can result. There have been instances,\n      indeed, where this method of screwing has resulted in the most\n      lamentable consequences, arising from a cause altogether distinct\n      from the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo. A load of\n      cotton, for example, tightly screwed while in certain conditions,\n      has been known, through the expansion of its bulk, to rend a\n      vessel asunder at sea. There can be no doubt either that the same\n      result would ensue in the case of tobacco, while undergoing its\n      usual course of fermentation, were it not for the interstices\r\nconsequent upon the rotundity of the hogsheads.\n\n      It is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to\n      be apprehended from shifting, and that precautions should be\n      always taken to guard against such misfortune. Only those who\n      have encountered a violent gale of wind, or rather who have\n      experienced the rolling of a vessel in a sudden calm after the\n      gale, can form an idea of the tremendous force of the plunges,\n      and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose\n      articles in the vessel. It is then that the necessity of a\n      cautious stowage, when there is a partial cargo, becomes obvious.\r\nWhen lying-to (especially with a small head sail), a vessel which\n      is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon\n      her beam-ends; this occurring even every fifteen or twenty\n      minutes upon an average, yet without any serious consequences\n      resulting, provided there be a proper stowage. If this, however,\n      has not been strictly attended to, in the first of these heavy\n      lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the side of the\n      vessel which lies upon the water, and, being thus prevented from\n      regaining her equilibrium, as she would otherwise necessarily do,","she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down. It is not\n      too much to say that at least one-half of the instances in which\n      vessels have foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to\n      a shifting of cargo or of ballast.\n\n      When a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board, the whole,\n      after being first stowed as compactly as may be, should be\n      covered with a layer of stout shifting-boards, extending\n      completely across the vessel. Upon these boards strong temporary\n      stanchions should be erected, reaching to the timbers above, and\n      thus securing every thing in its place. In cargoes consisting of\r\ngrain, or any similar matter, additional precautions are\n      requisite. A hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port\n      will be found not more than three fourths full upon reaching its\n      destination—this, too, although the freight, when measured bushel\n      by bushel by the consignee, will overrun by a vast deal (on\n      account of the swelling of the grain) the quantity consigned.\n      This result is occasioned by settling during the voyage, and is\n      the more perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the\n      weather experienced. If grain loosely thrown in a vessel, then,\r\nis ever so well secured by shifting-boards and stanchions, it\n      will be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring\n      about the most distressing calamities. To prevent these, every\n      method should be employed before leaving port to settle the cargo\n      as much as possible; and for this there are many contrivances,\n      among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into the\n      grain. Even after all this is done, and unusual pains taken to\n      secure the shifting-boards, no seaman who knows what he is about\n      will feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a","cargo of grain on board, and, least of all, with a partial cargo.\n      Yet there are hundreds of our coasting vessels, and, it is\n      likely, many more from the ports of Europe, which sail daily with\n      partial cargoes, even of the most dangerous species, and without\n      any precaution whatever. The wonder is that no more accidents\n      occur than do actually happen. A lamentable instance of this\n      heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of Captain Joel\n      Rice of the schooner Firefly, which sailed from Richmond,\n      Virginia, to Madeira, with a cargo of corn, in the year 1825. The\r\ncaptain had gone many voyages without serious accident, although\n      he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his\n      stowage, more than to secure it in the ordinary manner. He had\n      never before sailed with a cargo of grain, and on this occasion\n      had the corn thrown on board loosely, when it did not much more\n      than half fill the vessel. For the first portion of the voyage he\n      met with nothing more than light breezes; but when within a day’s\n      sail of Madeira there came on a strong gale from the N. N. E.\n      which forced him to lie-to. He brought the schooner to the wind\r\nunder a double-reefed foresail alone, when she rode as well as\n      any vessel could be expected to do, and shipped not a drop of\n      water. Toward night the gale somewhat abated, and she rolled with\n      more unsteadiness than before, but still did very well, until a\n      heavy lurch threw her upon her beam-ends to starboard. The corn\n      was then heard to shift bodily, the force of the movement\n      bursting open the main hatchway. The vessel went down like a\n      shot. This happened within hail of a small sloop from Madeira,\n      which picked up one of the crew (the only person saved), and","which rode out the gale in perfect security, as indeed a jolly\n      boat might have done under proper management.\n\n      The stowage on board the Grampus was most clumsily done, if\n      stowage that could be called which was little better than a\n      promiscuous huddling together of oil-casks {*1} and ship\n      furniture. I have already spoken of the condition of articles in\n      the hold. On the orlop deck there was space enough for my body\n      (as I have stated) between the oil-casks and the upper deck; a\n      space was left open around the main hatchway; and several other\r\nlarge spaces were left in the stowage. Near the hole cut through\n      the bulkhead by Augustus there was room enough for an entire\n      cask, and in this space I found myself comfortably situated for\n      the present.\n\n      By the time my friend had got safely into the berth, and\n      readjusted his handcuffs and the rope, it was broad daylight. We\n      had made a narrow escape indeed; for scarcely had he arranged all\n      matters, when the mate came below, with Dirk Peters and the cook.\n      They talked for some time about the vessel from the Cape Verds,\n      and seemed to be excessively anxious for her appearance. At\r\nlength the cook came to the berth in which Augustus was lying,\n      and seated himself in it near the head. I could see and hear\n      every thing from my hiding-place, for the piece cut out had not\n      been put back, and I was in momentary expectation that the negro\n      would fall against the pea-jacket, which was hung up to conceal\n      the aperture, in which case all would have been discovered, and\n      our lives would, no doubt, have been instantly sacrificed. Our\n      good fortune prevailed, however; and although he frequently\n      touched it as the vessel rolled, he never pressed against it","sufficiently to bring about a discovery. The bottom of the jacket\n      had been carefully fastened to the bulkhead, so that the hole\n      might not be seen by its swinging to one side. All this time\n      Tiger was lying in the foot of the berth, and appeared to have\n      recovered in some measure his faculties, for I could see him\n      occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath.\n\n      After a few minutes the mate and cook went above, leaving Dirk\n      Peters behind, who, as soon as they were gone, came and sat\n      himself down in the place just occupied by the mate. He began to\n      talk very sociably with Augustus, and we could now see that the\r\ngreater part of his apparent intoxication, while the two others\n      were with him, was a feint. He answered all my companion’s\n      questions with perfect freedom; told him that he had no doubt of\n      his father’s having been picked up, as there were no less than\n      five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he was cut\n      adrift; and used other language of a consolatory nature, which\n      occasioned me no less surprise than pleasure. Indeed, I began to\n      entertain hopes, that through the instrumentality of Peters we\n      might be finally enabled to regain possession of the brig, and\r\nthis idea I mentioned to Augustus as soon as I found an\n      opportunity. He thought the matter possible, but urged the\n      necessity of the greatest caution in making the attempt, as the\n      conduct of the hybrid appeared to be instigated by the most\n      arbitrary caprice alone; and, indeed, it was difficult to say if\n      he was at any moment of sound mind. Peters went upon deck in\n      about an hour, and did not return again until noon, when he\n      brought Augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding. Of\n      this, when we were left alone, I partook heartily, without","returning through the hole. No one else came down into the\n      forecastle during the day, and at night, I got into Augustus’\n      berth, where I slept soundly and sweetly until nearly daybreak,\n      when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon deck, and I regained\n      my hiding-place as quickly as possible. When the day was fully\n      broke, we found that Tiger had recovered his strength almost\n      entirely, and gave no indications of hydrophobia, drinking a\n      little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness.\n      During the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite.\r\nHis strange conduct had been brought on, no doubt, by the\n      deleterious quality of the air of the hold, and had no connexion\n      with canine madness. I could not sufficiently rejoice that I had\n      persisted in bringing him with me from the box. This day was the\n      thirtieth of June, and the thirteenth since the Grampus made sail\n      from Nantucket.\n\n      On the second of July the mate came below drunk as usual, and in\n      an excessively good-humor. He came to Augustus’s berth, and,\n      giving him a slap on the back, asked him if he thought he could\n      behave himself if he let him loose, and whether he would promise\r\nnot to be going into the cabin again. To this, of course, my\n      friend answered in the affirmative, when the ruffian set him at\n      liberty, after making him drink from a flask of rum which he drew\n      from his coat-pocket. Both now went on deck, and I did not see\n      Augustus for about three hours. He then came below with the good\n      news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he\n      pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast, and that he had been\n      ordered to sleep, as usual, in the forecastle. He brought me,\n      too, a good dinner, and a plentiful supply of water. The brig was","still cruising for the vessel from the Cape Verds, and a sail was\n      now in sight, which was thought to be the one in question. As the\n      events of the ensuing eight days were of little importance, and\n      had no direct bearing upon the main incidents of my narrative, I\n      will here throw them into the form of a journal, as I do not wish\n      to omit them altogether.\n\n      July 3. Augustus furnished me with three blankets, with which I\n      contrived a comfortable bed in my hiding-place. No one came\n      below, except my companion, during the day. Tiger took his\n      station in the berth just by the aperture, and slept heavily, as\r\nif not yet entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness.\n      Toward night a flaw of wind struck the brig before sail could be\n      taken in, and very nearly capsized her. The puff died away\n      immediately, however, and no damage was done beyond the splitting\n      of the foretopsail. Dirk Peters treated Augustus all this day\n      with great kindness and entered into a long conversation with him\n      respecting the Pacific Ocean, and the islands he had visited in\n      that region. He asked him whether he would not like to go with\n      the mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those\r\nquarters, and said that the men were gradually coming over to the\n      mate’s views. To this Augustus thought it best to reply that he\n      would be glad to go on such an adventure, since nothing better\n      could be done, and that any thing was preferable to a piratical\n      life.\n\n      July 4th. The vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from\n      Liverpool, and was allowed to pass unmolested. Augustus spent\n      most of his time on deck, with a view of obtaining all the\n      information in his power respecting the intentions of the\n      mutineers. They had frequent and violent quarrels among","themselves, in one of which a harpooner, Jim Bonner, was thrown\n      overboard. The party of the mate was gaining ground. Jim Bonner\n      belonged to the cook’s gang, of which Peters was a partisan.\n\n      July 5th. About daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the\n      west, which at noon freshened into a gale, so that the brig could\n      carry nothing more than her trysail and foresail. In taking in\n      the foretopsail, Simms, one of the common hands, and belonging\n      also to the cook’s gang, fell overboard, being very much in\n      liquor, and was drowned—no attempt being made to save him. The\r\nwhole number of persons on board was now thirteen, to wit: Dirk\n      Peters; Seymour, the black cook; Jones, Greely, Hartman Rogers\n      and William Allen, all of the cook’s party; the mate, whose name\n      I never learned; Absalom Hicks, Wilson, John Hunty Richard\n      Parker, of the mate’s party;—besides Augustus and myself.\n\n      July 6th. The gale lasted all this day, blowing in heavy squalls,\n      accompanied with rain. The brig took in a good deal of water\n      through her seams, and one of the pumps was kept continually\n      going, Augustus being forced to take his turn. Just at twilight a\r\nlarge ship passed close by us, without having been discovered\n      until within hail. The ship was supposed to be the one for which\n      the mutineers were on the lookout. The mate hailed her, but the\n      reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale. At eleven, a sea\n      was shipped amidships, which tore away a great portion of the\n      larboard bulwarks, and did some other slight damage. Toward\n      morning the weather moderated, and at sunrise there was very\n      little wind.\n\n      July 7th. There was a heavy swell running all this day, during\n      which the brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many","articles broke loose in the hold, as I could hear distinctly from\n      my hiding-place. I suffered a great deal from sea-sickness.\n      Peters had a long conversation this day with Augustus, and told\n      him that two of his gang, Greely and Allen, had gone over to the\n      mate, and were resolved to turn pirates. He put several questions\n      to Augustus which he did not then exactly understand. During a\n      part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel; and little\n      could be done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by the brig's\n      straining, and taking in the water through her seams. A sail was\r\nthrummed, and got under the bows, which aided us in some measure,\n      so that we began to gain upon the leak.\n\n      July 8th. A light breeze sprang up at sunrise from the eastward,\n      when the mate headed the brig to the southwest, with the\n      intention of making some of the West India islands in pursuance\n      of his piratical designs. No opposition was made by Peters or the\n      cook—at least none in the hearing of Augustus. All idea of taking\n      the vessel from the Cape Verds was abandoned. The leak was now\n      easily kept under by one pump going every three quarters of an\r\nhour. The sail was drawn from beneath the bows. Spoke two small\n      schooners during the day.\n\n      July 9th. Fine weather. All hands employed in repairing bulwarks.\n      Peters had again a long conversation with Augustus, and spoke\n      more plainly than he had done heretofore. He said nothing should\n      induce him to come into the mate’s views, and even hinted his\n      intention of taking the brig out of his hands. He asked my friend\n      if he could depend upon his aid in such case, to which Augustus\n      said, “Yes,” without hesitation. Peters then said he would sound\n      the others of his party upon the subject, and went away. During","the remainder of the day Augustus had no opportunity of speaking\n      with him privately.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\n      July 10. Spoke a brig from Rio, bound to Norfolk. Weather hazy,\n      with a light baffling wind from the eastward. To-day Hartman\n      Rogers died, having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after\n      drinking a glass of grog. This man was of the cook’s party, and\n      one upon whom Peters placed his main reliance. He told Augustus\n      that he believed the mate had poisoned him, and that he expected,\n      if he did not be on the look-out, his own turn would come\r\nshortly. There were now only himself, Jones, and the cook\n      belonging to his own gang—on the other side there were five. He\n      had spoken to Jones about taking the command from the mate; but\n      the project having been coolly received, he had been deterred\n      from pressing the matter any further, or from saying any thing to\n      the cook. It was well, as it happened, that he was so prudent,\n      for in the afternoon the cook expressed his determination of\n      siding with the mate, and went over formally to that party; while\n      Jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with Peters, and hinted\r\nthat he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation. There\n      was now, evidently, no time to be lost, and Peters expressed his\n      determination of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards,\n      provided Augustus would lend him his aid. My friend at once\n      assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that\n      purpose, and, thinking the opportunity a favourable one, made\n      known the fact of my being on board. At this the hybrid was not\n      more astonished than delighted, as he had no reliance whatever\n      upon Jones, whom he already considered as belonging to the party","of the mate. They went below immediately, when Augustus called to\n      me by name, and Peters and myself were soon made acquainted. It\n      was agreed that we should attempt to retake the vessel upon the\n      first good opportunity, leaving Jones altogether out of our\n      councils. In the event of success, we were to run the brig into\n      the first port that offered, and deliver her up. The desertion of\n      his party had frustrated Peters’ design of going into the\n      Pacific—an adventure which could not be accomplished without a\n      crew, and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial,\r\non the score of insanity (which he solemnly avowed had actuated\n      him in lending his aid to the mutiny), or upon obtaining a\n      pardon, if found guilty, through the representations of Augustus\n      and myself. Our deliberations were interrupted for the present by\n      the cry of, “All hands take in sail,” and Peters and Augustus ran\n      up on deck.\n\n      As usual, the crew were nearly all drunk; and, before sail could\n      be properly taken in, a violent squall laid the brig on her\n      beam-ends. By keeping her away, however, she righted, having\n      shipped a good deal of water. Scarcely was everything secure,\r\nwhen another squall took the vessel, and immediately afterward\n      another—no damage being done. There was every appearance of a\n      gale of wind, which, indeed, shortly came on, with great fury,\n      from the northward and westward. All was made as snug as\n      possible, and we laid-to, as usual, under a close-reefed\n      foresail. As night drew on, the wind increased in violence, with\n      a remarkably heavy sea. Peters now came into the forecastle with\n      Augustus, and we resumed our deliberations.\n\n      We agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the","present for carrying our designs into effect, as an attempt at\n      such a moment would never be anticipated. As the brig was snugly\n      laid-to, there would be no necessity of manoeuvring her until\n      good weather, when, if we succeeded in our attempt, we might\n      liberate one, or perhaps two of the men, to aid us in taking her\n      into port. The main difficulty was the great disproportion in our\n      forces. There were only three of us, and in the cabin there were\n      nine. All the arms on board, too, were in their possession, with\n      the exception of a pair of small pistols which Peters had\r\nconcealed about his person, and the large seaman’s knife which he\n      always wore in the waistband of his pantaloons. From certain\n      indications, too—such, for example, as there being no such thing\n      as an axe or a handspike lying in their customary places—we began\n      to fear that the mate had his suspicions, at least in regard to\n      Peters, and that he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid\n      of him. It was clear, indeed, that what we should determine to do\n      could not be done too soon. Still the odds were too much against\n      us to allow of our proceeding without the greatest caution.\r\nPeters proposed that he should go up on deck, and enter into\n      conversation with the watch (Allen), when he would be able to\n      throw him into the sea without trouble, and without making any\n      disturbance, by seizing a good opportunity, that Augustus and\n      myself should then come up, and endeavour to provide ourselves\n      with some kind of weapons from the deck, and that we should then\n      make a rush together, and secure the companion-way before any\n      opposition could be offered. I objected to this, because I could\n      not believe that the mate (who was a cunning fellow in all","matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudices) would\n      suffer himself to be so easily entrapped. The very fact of there\n      being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was\n      upon the alert,—it not being usual except in vessels where\n      discipline is most rigidly enforced, to station a watch on deck\n      when a vessel is lying-to in a gale of wind. As I address myself\n      principally, if not altogether, to persons who have never been to\n      sea, it may be as well to state the exact condition of a vessel\n      under such circumstances. Lying-to, or, in sea-parlance,\r\n“laying-to,” is a measure resorted to for various purposes, and\n      effected in various manners. In moderate weather it is frequently\n      done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a stand-still,\n      to wait for another vessel or any similar object. If the vessel\n      which lies-to is under full sail, the manoeuvre is usually\n      accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails, so as\n      to let the wind take them aback, when she becomes stationary. But\n      we are now speaking of lying-to in a gale of wind. This is done\n      when the wind is ahead, and too violent to admit of carrying sail\r\nwithout danger of capsizing; and sometimes even when the wind is\n      fair, but the sea too heavy for the vessel to be put before it.\n      If a vessel be suffered to scud before the wind in a very heavy\n      sea, much damage is usually done her by the shipping of water\n      over her stern, and sometimes by the violent plunges she makes\n      forward. This manoeuvre, then, is seldom resorted to in such\n      case, unless through necessity. When the vessel is in a leaky\n      condition she is often put before the wind even in the heaviest\n      seas; for, when lying-to, her seams are sure to be greatly opened","by her violent straining, and it is not so much the case when\n      scudding. Often, too, it becomes necessary to scud a vessel,\n      either when the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in\n      pieces the sail which is employed with a view of bringing her\n      head to the wind, or when, through the false modelling of the\n      frame or other causes, this main object cannot be effected.\n\n      Vessels in a gale of wind are laid-to in different manners,\n      according to their peculiar construction. Some lie-to best under\n      a foresail, and this, I believe, is the sail most usually\n      employed. Large square-rigged vessels have sails for the express\r\npurpose, called storm-staysails. But the jib is occasionally\n      employed by itself,—sometimes the jib and foresail, or a\n      double-reefed foresail, and not unfrequently the after-sails, are\n      made use of. Foretopsails are very often found to answer the\n      purpose better than any other species of sail. The Grampus was\n      generally laid-to under a close-reefed foresail.\n\n      When a vessel is to be laid-to, her head is brought up to the\n      wind just so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when\n      hauled flat aft, that is, when brought diagonally across the\r\nvessel. This being done, the bows point within a few degrees of\n      the direction from which the wind issues, and the windward bow of\n      course receives the shock of the waves. In this situation a good\n      vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind without shipping a\n      drop of water, and without any further attention being requisite\n      on the part of the crew. The helm is usually lashed down, but\n      this is altogether unnecessary (except on account of the noise it\n      makes when loose), for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel\n      when lying-to. Indeed, the helm had far better be left loose than","lashed very fast, for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy\n      seas if there be no room for the helm to play. As long as the\n      sail holds, a well modelled vessel will maintain her situation,\n      and ride every sea, as if instinct with life and reason. If the\n      violence of the wind, however, should tear the sail into pieces\n      (a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under\n      ordinary circumstances), there is then imminent danger. The\n      vessel falls off from the wind, and, coming broadside to the sea,\n      is completely at its mercy: the only resource in this case is to\r\nput her quietly before the wind, letting her scud until some\n      other sail can be set. Some vessels will lie-to under no sail\n      whatever, but such are not to be trusted at sea.\n\n      But to return from this digression. It had never been customary\n      with the mate to have any watch on deck when lying-to in a gale\n      of wind, and the fact that he had now one, coupled with the\n      circumstance of the missing axes and handspikes, fully convinced\n      us that the crew were too well on the watch to be taken by\n      surprise in the manner Peters had suggested. Something, however,\n      was to be done, and that with as little delay as practicable, for\r\nthere could be no doubt that a suspicion having been once\n      entertained against Peters, he would be sacrificed upon the\n      earliest occasion, and one would certainly be either found or\n      made upon the breaking of the gale.\n\n      Augustus now suggested that if Peters could contrive to remove,\n      under any pretext, the piece of chain-cable which lay over the\n      trap in the stateroom, we might possibly be able to come upon\n      them unawares by means of the hold; but a little reflection\n      convinced us that the vessel rolled and pitched too violently for\n      any attempt of that nature.","By good fortune I at length hit upon the idea of working upon the\n      superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate. It will\n      be remembered that one of the crew, Hartman Rogers, had died\n      during the morning, having been attacked two days before with\n      spasms after drinking some spirits and water. Peters had\n      expressed to us his opinion that this man had been poisoned by\n      the mate, and for this belief he had reasons, so he said, which\n      were incontrovertible, but which he could not be prevailed upon\n      to explain to us—this wayward refusal being only in keeping with\r\nother points of his singular character. But whether or not he had\n      any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves,\n      we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion, and determined\n      to act accordingly.\n\n      Rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon, in violent\n      convulsions; and the corpse presented in a few minutes after\n      death one of the most horrid and loathsome spectacles I ever\n      remember to have seen. The stomach was swollen immensely, like\n      that of a man who has been drowned and lain under water for many\n      weeks. The hands were in the same condition, while the face was\r\nshrunken, shrivelled, and of a chalky whiteness, except where\n      relieved by two or three glaring red blotches like those\n      occasioned by the erysipelas: one of these blotches extended\n      diagonally across the face, completely covering up an eye as if\n      with a band of red velvet. In this disgusting condition the body\n      had been brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown\n      overboard, when the mate getting a glimpse of it (for he now saw\n      it for the first time), and being either touched with remorse for\n      his crime or struck with terror at so horrible a sight, ordered","the men to sew the body up in its hammock, and allow it the usual\n      rites of sea-burial. Having given these directions, he went\n      below, as if to avoid any further sight of his victim. While\n      preparations were making to obey his orders, the gale came on\n      with great fury, and the design was abandoned for the present.\n      The corpse, left to itself, was washed into the larboard\n      scuppers, where it still lay at the time of which I speak,\n      floundering about with the furious lurches of the brig.\n\n      Having arranged our plan, we set about putting it in execution as\r\nspeedily as possible. Peters went upon deck, and, as he had\n      anticipated, was immediately accosted by Allen, who appeared to\n      be stationed more as a watch upon the forecastle than for any\n      other purpose. The fate of this villain, however, was speedily\n      and silently decided; for Peters, approaching him in a careless\n      manner, as if about to address him, seized him by the throat,\n      and, before he could utter a single cry, tossed him over the\n      bulwarks. He then called to us, and we came up. Our first\n      precaution was to look about for something with which to arm\r\nourselves, and in doing this we had to proceed with great care,\n      for it was impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding\n      fast, and violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge\n      forward. It was indispensable, too, that we should be quick in\n      our operations, for every minute we expected the mate to be up to\n      set the pumps going, as it was evident the brig must be taking in\n      water very fast. After searching about for some time, we could\n      find nothing more fit for our purpose than the two pump-handles,\n      one of which Augustus took, and I the other. Having secured","these, we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and dropped the\n      body overboard. Peters and myself then went below, leaving\n      Augustus to watch upon deck, where he took his station just where\n      Allen had been placed, and with his back to the cabin\n      companionway, so that, if any of the mate's gang should come up,\n      he might suppose it was the watch.\n\n      As soon as I got below I commenced disguising myself so as to\n      represent the corpse of Rogers. The shirt which we had taken from\n      the body aided us very much, for it was of singular form and\r\ncharacter, and easily recognizable—a kind of smock, which the\n      deceased wore over his other clothing. It was a blue stockinett,\n      with large white stripes running across. Having put this on, I\n      proceeded to equip myself with a false stomach, in imitation of\n      the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse. This was soon\n      effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes. I then gave\n      the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white\n      woollen mittens, and filling them in with any kind of rags that\n      offered themselves. Peters then arranged my face, first rubbing\r\nit well over with white chalk, and afterward blotching it with\n      blood, which he took from a cut in his finger. The streak across\n      the eye was not forgotten and presented a most shocking\n      appearance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\n      As I viewed myself in a fragment of looking-glass which hung up\n      in the cabin, and by the dim light of a kind of battle-lantern, I\n      was so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance, and\n      at the recollection of the terrific reality which I was thus\n      representing, that I was seized with a violent tremour, and could\n      scarcely summon resolution to go on with my part. It was","necessary, however, to act with decision, and Peters and myself\n      went upon deck.\n\n      We there found everything safe, and, keeping close to the\n      bulwarks, the three of us crept to the cabin companion-way. It\n      was only partially closed, precautions having been taken to\n      prevent its being suddenly pushed to from without, by means of\n      placing billets of wood on the upper step so as to interfere with\n      the shutting. We found no difficulty in getting a full view of\n      the interior of the cabin through the cracks where the hinges\n      were placed. It now proved to have been very fortunate for us\r\nthat we had not attempted to take them by surprise, for they were\n      evidently on the alert. Only one was asleep, and he lying just at\n      the foot of the companion-ladder, with a musket by his side. The\n      rest were seated on several mattresses, which had been taken from\n      the berths and thrown on the floor. They were engaged in earnest\n      conversation; and although they had been carousing, as appeared\n      from two empty jugs, with some tin tumblers which lay about, they\n      were not as much intoxicated as usual. All had knives, one or two\n      of them pistols, and a great many muskets were lying in a berth\r\nclose at hand.\n\n      We listened to their conversation for some time before we could\n      make up our minds how to act, having as yet resolved on nothing\n      determinate, except that we would attempt to paralyze their\n      exertions, when we should attack them, by means of the apparition\n      of Rogers. They were discussing their piratical plans, in which\n      all we could hear distinctly was, that they would unite with the\n      crew of a schooner _Hornet_, and, if possible, get the schooner\n      herself into their possession preparatory to some attempt on a\n      large scale, the particulars of which could not be made out by","either of us.\n\n      One of the men spoke of Peters, when the mate replied to him in a\n      low voice which could not be distinguished, and afterward added\n      more loudly, that “he could not understand his being so much\n      forward with the captain’s brat in the forecastle, and he thought\n      the sooner both of them were overboard the better.” To this no\n      answer was made, but we could easily perceive that the hint was\n      well received by the whole party, and more particularly by Jones.\n      At this period I was excessively agitated, the more so as I could\r\nsee that neither Augustus nor Peters could determine how to act.\n      I made up my mind, however, to sell my life as dearly as\n      possible, and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any feelings\n      of trepidation.\n\n      The tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the\n      rigging, and the washing of the sea over the deck, prevented us\n      from hearing what was said, except during momentary lulls. In one\n      of these, we all distinctly heard the mate tell one of the men to\n      “go forward, have an eye upon them, for he wanted no such secret\n      doings on board the brig.” It was well for us that the pitching\r\nof the vessel at this moment was so violent as to prevent this\n      order from being carried into instant execution. The cook got up\n      from his mattress to go for us, when a tremendous lurch, which I\n      thought would carry away the masts, threw him headlong against\n      one of the larboard stateroom doors, bursting it open, and\n      creating a good deal of other confusion. Luckily, neither of our\n      party was thrown from his position, and we had time to make a\n      precipitate retreat to the forecastle, and arrange a hurried plan\n      of action before the messenger made his appearance, or rather","before he put his head out of the companion-hatch, for he did not\n      come on deck. From this station he could not notice the absence\n      of Allen, and he accordingly bawled out, as if to him, repeating\n      the orders of the mate. Peters cried out, “Ay, ay,” in a\n      disguised voice, and the cook immediately went below, without\n      entertaining a suspicion that all was not right.\n\n      My two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the\n      cabin, Peters closing the door after him in the same manner he\n      had found it. The mate received them with feigned cordiality, and\r\ntold Augustus that, since he had behaved himself so well of late,\n      he might take up his quarters in the cabin and be one of them for\n      the future. He then poured him out a tumbler half full of rum,\n      and made him drink it. All this I saw and heard, for I followed\n      my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut, and took up\n      my old point of observation. I had brought with me the two\n      pump-handles, one of which I secured near the companion-way, to\n      be ready for use when required.\n\n      I now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good\n      view of all that was passing within, and endeavoured to nerve\r\nmyself to the task of descending among the mutineers when Peters\n      should make a signal to me, as agreed upon. Presently he\n      contrived to turn the conversation upon the bloody deeds of the\n      mutiny, and by degrees led the men to talk of the thousand\n      superstitions which are so universally current among seamen. I\n      could not make out all that was said, but I could plainly see the\n      effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present.\n      The mate was evidently much agitated, and presently, when some\n      one mentioned the terrific appearance of Rogers’ corpse, I","thought he was upon the point of swooning. Peters now asked him\n      if he did not think it would be better to have the body thrown\n      overboard at once as it was too horrible a sight to see it\n      floundering about in the scuppers. At this the villain absolutely\n      gasped for breath, and turned his head slowly round upon his\n      companions, as if imploring some one to go up and perform the\n      task. No one, however, stirred, and it was quite evident that the\n      whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous\n      excitement. Peters now made me the signal. I immediately threw\r\nopen the door of the companion-way, and, descending, without\n      uttering a syllable, stood erect in the midst of the party.\n\n      The intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at\n      all to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken\n      into consideration. Usually, in cases of a similar nature, there\n      is left in the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as\n      to the reality of the vision before his eyes; a degree of hope,\n      however feeble, that he is the victim of chicanery, and that the\n      apparition is not actually a visitant from the old world of\r\nshadows. It is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt\n      have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation, and that\n      the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about, is\n      to be attributed, even in the cases most in point, and where most\n      suffering has been experienced, more to a kind of anticipative\n      horror, lest the apparition might possibly be real, than to an\n      unwavering belief in its reality. But, in the present instance,\n      it will be seen immediately, that in the minds of the mutineers\n      there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a","doubt that the apparition of Rogers was indeed a revivification\n      of his disgusting corpse, or at least its spiritual image. The\n      isolated situation of the brig, with its entire inaccessibility\n      on account of the gale, confined the apparently possible means of\n      deception within such narrow and definite limits, that they must\n      have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance.\n      They had now been at sea twenty-four days, without holding more\n      than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever. The whole\n      of the crew, too—at least all whom they had the most remote\r\nreason for suspecting to be on board—were assembled in the cabin,\n      with the exception of Allen, the watch; and his gigantic stature\n      (he was six feet six inches high) was too familiar in their eyes\n      to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to\n      enter their minds even for an instant. Add to these\n      considerations the awe-inspiring nature of the tempest, and that\n      of the conversation brought about by Peters; the deep impression\n      which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse had made in the\n      morning upon the imaginations of the men; the excellence of the\r\nimitation in my person, and the uncertain and wavering light in\n      which they beheld me, as the glare of the cabin lantern, swinging\n      violently to and fro, fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure,\n      and there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even\n      more than the entire effect which we had anticipated. The mate\n      sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying, and, without\n      uttering a syllable, fell back, stone dead, upon the cabin floor,\n      and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the\n      brig. Of the remaining seven, there were but three who had at","first any degree of presence of mind. The four others sat for\n      some time rooted apparently to the floor, the most pitiable\n      objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered. The\n      only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook, John\n      Hunt, and Richard Parker; but they made but a feeble and\n      irresolute defence. The two former were shot instantly by Peters,\n      and I felled Parker with a blow on the head from the pump-handle\n      which I had brought with me. In the meantime, Augustus seized one\n      of the muskets lying on the floor and shot another mutineer\r\nWilson through the breast. There were now but three remaining;\n      but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy, and\n      perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon\n      them, for they fought with great resolution and fury, and, but\n      for the immense muscular strength of Peters, might have\n      ultimately got the better of us. These three men were—Jones,\n      Greely, and Absolom Hicks. Jones had thrown Augustus to the\n      floor, stabbed him in several places along the right arm, and\n      would no doubt have soon dispatched him (as neither Peters nor\r\nmyself could immediately get rid of our own antagonists), had it\n      not been for the timely aid of a friend, upon whose assistance\n      we, surely, had never depended. This friend was no other than\n      Tiger. With a low growl, he bounded into the cabin, at a most\n      critical moment for Augustus, and throwing himself upon Jones,\n      pinned him to the floor in an instant. My friend, however, was\n      now too much injured to render us any aid whatever, and I was so\n      encumbered with my disguise that I could do but little. The dog\n      would not leave his hold upon the throat of Jones—Peters,","nevertheless, was far more than a match for the two men who\n      remained, and would, no doubt, have dispatched them sooner, had\n      it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act, and the\n      tremendous lurches of the vessel. Presently he was enabled to get\n      hold of a heavy stool, several of which lay about the floor. With\n      this he beat out the brains of Greely as he was in the act of\n      discharging a musket at me, and immediately afterward a roll of\n      the brig throwing him in contact with Hicks, he seized him by the\n      throat, and, by dint of sheer strength, strangled him\r\ninstantaneously. Thus, in far less time than I have taken to tell\n      it, we found ourselves masters of the brig.\n\n      The only person of our opponents who was left alive was Richard\n      Parker. This man, it will be remembered, I had knocked down with\n      a blow from the pump-handle at the commencement of the attack. He\n      now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom; but,\n      upon Peters touching him with his foot, he spoke, and entreated\n      for mercy. His head was only slightly cut, and otherwise he had\n      received no injury, having been merely stunned by the blow. He\r\nnow got up, and, for the present, we secured his hands behind his\n      back. The dog was still growling over Jones; but, upon\n      examination, we found him completely dead, the blood issuing in a\n      stream from a deep wound in the throat, inflicted, no doubt, by\n      the sharp teeth of the animal.\n\n      It was now about one o’clock in the morning, and the wind was\n      still blowing tremendously. The brig evidently laboured much more\n      than usual, and it became absolutely necessary that something\n      should be done with a view of easing her in some measure. At\n      almost every roll to leeward she shipped a sea, several of which","came partially down into the cabin during our scuffle, the\n      hatchway having been left open by myself when I descended. The\n      entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away, as well\n      as the caboose, together with the jollyboat from the counter. The\n      creaking and working of the mainmast, too, gave indication that\n      it was nearly sprung. To make room for more stowage in the\n      afterhold, the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks\n      (a very reprehensible practice, occasionally resorted to by\n      ignorant ship-builders), so that it was in imminent danger of\r\nworking from its step. But, to crown all our difficulties, we\n      plummed the well, and found no less than seven feet of water.\n\n      Leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin, we got to work\n      immediately at the pumps—Parker, of course, being set at liberty\n      to assist us in the labour. Augustus’s arm was bound up as well\n      as we could effect it, and he did what he could, but that was not\n      much. However, we found that we could just manage to keep the\n      leak from gaining upon us by having one pump constantly going. As\n      there were only four of us, this was severe labour; but we\r\nendeavoured to keep up our spirits, and looked anxiously for\n      daybreak, when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away the\n      mainmast.\n\n      In this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue,\n      and, when the day at length broke, the gale had neither abated in\n      the least, nor were there any signs of its abating. We now\n      dragged the bodies on deck and threw them overboard. Our next\n      care was to get rid of the mainmast. The necessary preparations\n      having been made, Peters cut away at the mast (having found axes\n      in the cabin), while the rest of us stood by the stays and","lanyards. As the brig gave a tremendous lee-lurch, the word was\n      given to cut away the weather-lanyards, which being done, the\n      whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea, clear of the\n      brig, and without doing any material injury. We now found that\n      the vessel did not labour quite as much as before, but our\n      situation was still exceedingly precarious, and in spite of the\n      utmost exertions, we could not gain upon the leak without the aid\n      of both pumps. The little assistance which Augustus could render\n      us was not really of any importance. To add to our distress, a\r\nheavy sea, striking the brig to the windward, threw her off\n      several points from the wind, and, before she could regain her\n      position, another broke completely over her, and hurled her full\n      upon her beam-ends. The ballast now shifted in a mass to leeward\n      (the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for some\n      time), and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us\n      from capsizing. Presently, however, we partially righted; but the\n      ballast still retaining its place to larboard, we lay so much\n      along that it was useless to think of working the pumps, which\r\nindeed we could not have done much longer in any case, as our\n      hands were entirely raw with the excessive labour we had\n      undergone, and were bleeding in the most horrible manner.\n\n      Contrary to Parker’s advice, we now proceeded to cut away the\n      foremast, and at length accomplished it after much difficulty,\n      owing to the position in which we lay. In going overboard the\n      wreck took with it the bowsprit, and left us a complete hulk.\n\n      So far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our\n      longboat, which had received no damage from any of the huge seas","which had come on board. But we had not long to congratulate\n      ourselves; for the foremast having gone, and, of course, the\n      foresail with it, by which the brig had been steadied, every sea\n      now made a complete breach over us, and in five minutes our deck\n      was swept from stem to stern, the longboat and starboard bulwarks\n      torn off, and even the windlass shattered into fragments. It was,\n      indeed, hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable\n      condition.\n\n      At noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale’s\n      abating, but in this we were sadly disappointed, for it only\r\nlulled for a few minutes to blow with redoubled fury. About four\n      in the afternoon it was utterly impossible to stand up against\n      the violence of the blast; and, as the night closed in upon us, I\n      had not a shadow of hope that the vessel would hold together\n      until morning.\n\n      By midnight we had settled very deep in the water, which was now\n      up to the orlop deck. The rudder went soon afterward, the sea\n      which tore it away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely\n      from the water, against which she thumped in her descent with\n      such a concussion as would be occasioned by going ashore. We had\r\nall calculated that the rudder would hold its own to the last, as\n      it was unusually strong, being rigged as I have never seen one\n      rigged either before or since. Down its main timber there ran a\n      succession of stout iron hooks, and others in the same manner\n      down the stern-post. Through these hooks there extended a very\n      thick wrought-iron rod, the rudder being thus held to the\n      stern-post and swinging freely on the rod. The tremendous force\n      of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact, that\n      the hooks in the stern-post, which ran entirely through it, being","clinched on the inside, were drawn every one of them completely\n      out of the solid wood.\n\n      We had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this\n      shock, when one of the most tremendous waves I had then ever\n      known broke right on board of us, sweeping the companion-way\n      clear off, bursting in the hatchways, and filling every inch of\n      the vessel with water.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\n      Luckily, just before night, all four of us had lashed ourselves\n      firmly to the fragments of the windlass, lying in this manner as\n      flat upon the deck as possible. This precaution alone saved us\r\nfrom destruction. As it was, we were all more or less stunned by\n      the immense weight of water which tumbled upon us, and which did\n      not roll from above us until we were nearly exhausted. As soon as\n      I could recover breath, I called aloud to my companions. Augustus\n      alone replied, saying: “It is all over with us, and may God have\n      mercy upon our souls!” By-and-by both the others were enabled to\n      speak, when they exhorted us to take courage, as there was still\n      hope; it being impossible, from the nature of the cargo, that the\n      brig could go down, and there being every chance that the gale\r\nwould blow over by the morning. These words inspired me with new\n      life; for, strange as it may seem, although it was obvious that a\n      vessel with a cargo of empty oil-casks would not sink, I had been\n      hitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this\n      consideration altogether; and the danger which I had for some\n      time regarded as the most imminent was that of foundering. As\n      hope revived within me, I made use of every opportunity to\n      strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains of the\n      windlass, and in this occupation I soon discovered that my","companions were also busy. The night was as dark as it could\n      possibly be, and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which\n      surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing. Our deck lay\n      level with the sea, or rather we were encircled with a towering\n      ridge of foam, a portion of which swept over us every instant. It\n      is not too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of the\n      water more than one second in three. Although we lay close\n      together, no one of us could see the other, or, indeed, any\n      portion of the brig itself, upon which we were so tempestuously\r\nhurled about. At intervals we called one to the other, thus\n      endeavouring to keep alive hope, and render consolation and\n      encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it. The\n      feeble condition of Augustus made him an object of solicitude\n      with us all; and as, from the lacerated condition of his right\n      arm, it must have been impossible for him to secure his lashings\n      with any degree of firmness, we were in momentary expectation of\n      finding that he had gone overboard—yet to render him aid was a\n      thing altogether out of the question. Fortunately, his station\r\nwas more secure than that of any of the rest of us; for the upper\n      part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered\n      windlass, the seas, as they tumbled in upon him, were greatly\n      broken in their violence. In any other situation than this (into\n      which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed himself\n      in a very exposed spot) he must inevitably have perished before\n      morning. Owing to the brig’s lying so much along, we were all\n      less liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the\n      case. The heel, as I have before stated, was to larboard, about","one half of the deck being constantly under water. The seas,\n      therefore, which struck us to starboard were much broken, by the\n      vessel’s side, only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on\n      our faces; while those which came from larboard being what are\n      called back-water seas, and obtaining little hold upon us on\n      account of our posture, had not sufficient force to drag us from\n      our fastenings.\n\n      In this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to\n      show us more fully the horrors which surrounded us. The brig was\n      a mere log, rolling about at the mercy of every wave; the gale\r\nwas upon the increase, if any thing, blowing indeed a complete\n      hurricane, and there appeared to us no earthly prospect of\n      deliverance. For several hours we held on in silence, expecting\n      every moment that our lashings would either give way, that the\n      remains of the windlass would go by the board, or that some of\n      the huge seas, which roared in every direction around us and\n      above us, would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we\n      should be drowned before it could regain the surface. By the\n      mercy of God, however, we were preserved from these imminent\r\ndangers, and about midday were cheered by the light of the\n      blessed sun. Shortly afterward we could perceive a sensible\n      diminution in the force of the wind, when, now for the first time\n      since the latter part of the evening before, Augustus spoke,\n      asking Peters, who lay closest to him, if he thought there was\n      any possibility of our being saved. As no reply was at first made\n      to this question, we all concluded that the hybrid had been\n      drowned where he lay; but presently, to our great joy, he spoke,\n      although very feebly, saying that he was in great pain, being so","cut by the tightness of his lashings across the stomach, that he\n      must either find means of loosening them or perish, as it was\n      impossible that he could endure his misery much longer. This\n      occasioned us great distress, as it was altogether useless to\n      think of aiding him in any manner while the sea continued washing\n      over us as it did. We exhorted him to bear his sufferings with\n      fortitude, and promised to seize the first opportunity which\n      should offer itself to relieve him. He replied that it would soon\n      be too late; that it would be all over with him before we could\r\nhelp him; and then, after moaning for some minutes, lay silent,\n      when we concluded that he had perished.\n\n      As the evening drew on, the sea had fallen so much that scarcely\n      more than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the\n      course of five minutes, and the wind had abated a great deal,\n      although still blowing a severe gale. I had not heard any of my\n      companions speak for hours, and now called to Augustus. He\n      replied, although very feebly, so that I could not distinguish\n      what he said. I then spoke to Peters and to Parker, neither of\n      whom returned any answer.\r\nShortly after this period I fell into a state of partial\n      insensibility, during which the most pleasing images floated in\n      my imagination; such as green trees, waving meadows of ripe\n      grain, processions of dancing girls, troops of cavalry, and other\n      phantasies. I now remember that, in all which passed before my\n      mind’s eye, motion was a predominant idea. Thus, I never fancied\n      any stationary object, such as a house, a mountain, or any thing\n      of that kind; but windmills, ships, large birds, balloons, people\n      on horseback, carriages driving furiously, and similar moving","objects, presented themselves in endless succession. When I\n      recovered from this state, the sun was, as near as I could guess,\n      an hour high. I had the greatest difficulty in bringing to\n      recollection the various circumstances connected with my\n      situation, and for some time remained firmly convinced that I was\n      still in the hold of the brig, near the box, and that the body of\n      Parker was that of Tiger.\n\n      When I at length completely came to my senses, I found that the\n      wind blew no more than a moderate breeze, and that the sea was\n      comparatively calm; so much so that it only washed over the brig\r\namidships. My left arm had broken loose from its lashings, and\n      was much cut about the elbow; my right was entirely benumbed, and\n      the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the pressure of the\n      rope, which had worked from the shoulder downward. I was also in\n      great pain from another rope which went about my waist, and had\n      been drawn to an insufferable degree of tightness. Looking round\n      upon my companions, I saw that Peters still lived, although a\n      thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him\n      the appearance of being cut nearly in two; as I stirred, he made\r\na feeble motion to me with his hand, pointing to the rope.\n      Augustus gave no indication of life whatever, and was bent nearly\n      double across a splinter of the windlass. Parker spoke to me when\n      he saw me moving, and asked me if I had not sufficient strength\n      to release him from his situation, saying that if I would summon\n      up what spirits I could, and contrive to untie him, we might yet\n      save our lives; but that otherwise we must all perish. I told him\n      to take courage, and I would endeavor to free him. Feeling in my\n      pantaloons’ pocket, I got hold of my penknife, and, after several","ineffectual attempts, at length succeeded in opening it. I then,\n      with my left hand, managed to free my right from its fastenings,\n      and afterward cut the other ropes which held me. Upon attempting,\n      however, to move from my position, I found that my legs failed me\n      altogether, and that I could not get up; neither could I move my\n      right arm in any direction. Upon mentioning this to Parker, he\n      advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes, holding on to the\n      windlass with my left hand, so as to allow time for the blood to\n      circulate. Doing this, the numbness presently began to die away\r\nso that I could move first one of my legs, and then the other,\n      and, shortly afterward I regained the partial use of my right\n      arm. I now crawled with great caution toward Parker, without\n      getting on my legs, and soon cut loose all the lashings about\n      him, when, after a short delay, he also recovered the partial use\n      of his limbs. We now lost no time in getting loose the rope from\n      Peters. It had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his\n      woollen pantaloons, and through two shirts, and made its way into\n      his groin, from which the blood flowed out copiously as we\r\nremoved the cordage. No sooner had we removed it, however, than\n      he spoke, and seemed to experience instant relief—being able to\n      move with much greater ease than either Parker or myself—this was\n      no doubt owing to the discharge of blood.\n\n      We had little hopes that Augustus would recover, as he evinced no\n      signs of life; but, upon getting to him, we discovered that he\n      had merely swooned from the loss of blood, the bandages we had\n      placed around his wounded arm having been torn off by the water;\n      none of the ropes which held him to the windlass were drawn","sufficiently tight to occasion his death. Having relieved him\n      from the fastenings, and got him clear of the broken wood about\n      the windlass, we secured him in a dry place to windward, with his\n      head somewhat lower than his body, and all three of us busied\n      ourselves in chafing his limbs. In about half an hour he came to\n      himself, although it was not until the next morning that he gave\n      signs of recognizing any of us, or had sufficient strength to\n      speak. By the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was\n      quite dark, and it began to cloud up, so that we were again in\r\nthe greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard, in which\n      event nothing could have saved us from perishing, exhausted as we\n      were. By good fortune it continued very moderate during the\n      night, the sea subsiding every minute, which gave us great hopes\n      of ultimate preservation. A gentle breeze still blew from the N.\n      W., but the weather was not at all cold. Augustus was lashed\n      carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from\n      slipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel, as he was still\n      too weak to hold on at all. For ourselves there was no such\r\nnecessity. We sat close together, supporting each other with the\n      aid of the broken ropes about the windlass, and devising methods\n      of escape from our frightful situation. We derived much comfort\n      from taking off our clothes and wringing the water from them.\n      When we put them on after this, they felt remarkably warm and\n      pleasant, and served to invigorate us in no little degree. We\n      helped Augustus off with his, and wrung them for him, when he\n      experienced the same comfort.\n\n      Our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst, and\n      when we looked forward to the means of relief in this respect,","our hearts sunk within us, and we were induced to regret that we\n      had escaped the less dreadful perils of the sea. We endeavoured,\n      however, to console ourselves with the hope of being speedily\n      picked up by some vessel and encouraged each other to bear with\n      fortitude the evils that might happen.\n\n      The morning of the fourteenth at length dawned, and the weather\n      still continued clear and pleasant, with a steady but very light\n      breeze from the N. W. The sea was now quite smooth, and as, from\n      some cause which we could not determine, the brig did not lie so\r\nmuch along as she had done before, the deck was comparatively\n      dry, and we could move about with freedom. We had now been better\n      than three entire days and nights without either food or drink,\n      and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an attempt\n      to get up something from below. As the brig was completely full\n      of water, we went to this work despondently, and with but little\n      expectation of being able to obtain anything. We made a kind of\n      drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of\n      the companion-hatch into two pieces of wood. Tying these across\r\neach other, and fastening them to the end of a rope, we threw\n      them into the cabin, and dragged them to and fro, in the faint\n      hope of being thus able to entangle some article which might be\n      of use to us for food, or which might at least render us\n      assistance in getting it. We spent the greater part of the\n      morning in this labour without effect, fishing up nothing more\n      than a few bedclothes, which were readily caught by the nails.\n      Indeed, our contrivance was so very clumsy that any greater\n      success was hardly to be anticipated.\n\n      We now tried the forecastle, but equally in vain, and were upon","the brink of despair, when Peters proposed that we should fasten\n      a rope to his body, and let him make an attempt to get up\n      something by diving into the cabin. This proposition we hailed\n      with all the delight which reviving hope could inspire. He\n      proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the exception\n      of his pantaloons; and a strong rope was then carefully fastened\n      around his middle, being brought up over his shoulders in such a\n      manner that there was no possibility of its slipping. The\n      undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger; for, as we\r\ncould hardly expect to find much, if any, provision in the cabin\n      itself, it was necessary that the diver, after letting himself\n      down, should make a turn to the right, and proceed under water a\n      distance of ten or twelve feet, in a narrow passage, to the\n      storeroom, and return, without drawing breath.\n\n      Everything being ready, Peters now descended in the cabin, going\n      down the companion-ladder until the water reached his chin. He\n      then plunged in, head first, turning to the right as he plunged,\n      and endeavouring to make his way to the storeroom. In this first\r\nattempt, however, he was altogether unsuccessful. In less than\n      half a minute after his going down we felt the rope jerked\n      violently (the signal we had agreed upon when he desired to be\n      drawn up). We accordingly drew him up instantly, but so\n      incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder. He had\n      brought nothing with him, and had been unable to penetrate more\n      than a very little way into the passage, owing to the constant\n      exertions he found it necessary to make in order to keep himself\n      from floating up against the deck. Upon getting out he was very","much exhausted, and had to rest full fifteen minutes before he\n      could again venture to descend.\n\n      The second attempt met with even worse success; for he remained\n      so long under water without giving the signal, that, becoming\n      alarmed for his safety, we drew him out without it, and found\n      that he was almost at the last gasp, having, as he said,\n      repeatedly jerked at the rope without our feeling it. This was\n      probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the\n      balustrade at the foot of the ladder. This balustrade was,\n      indeed, so much in the way, that we determined to remove it, if\r\npossible, before proceeding with our design. As we had no means\n      of getting it away except by main force, we all descended into\n      the water as far as we could on the ladder, and giving a pull\n      against it with our united strength, succeeded in breaking it\n      down.\n\n      The third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first,\n      and it now became evident that nothing could be done in this\n      manner without the aid of some weight with which the diver might\n      steady himself, and keep to the floor of the cabin while making\n      his search. For a long time we looked about in vain for something\r\nwhich might answer this purpose; but at length, to our great joy,\n      we discovered one of the weather-forechains so loose that we had\n      not the least difficulty in wrenching it off. Having fastened\n      this securely to one of his ankles, Peters now made his fourth\n      descent into the cabin, and this time succeeded in making his way\n      to the door of the steward’s room. To his inexpressible grief,\n      however, he found it locked, and was obliged to return without\n      effecting an entrance, as, with the greatest exertion, he could\n      remain under water not more, at the utmost extent, than a single","minute. Our affairs now looked gloomy indeed, and neither\n      Augustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears, as we\n      thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us, and the\n      slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape.\n      But this weakness was not of long duration. Throwing ourselves on\n      our knees to God, we implored His aid in the many dangers which\n      beset us; and arose with renewed hope and vigor to think what\n      could yet be done by mortal means toward accomplishing our\n      deliverance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\r\nShortly afterward an incident occurred which I am induced to look\n      upon as more intensely productive of emotion, as far more replete\n      with the extremes first of delight and then of horror, than even\n      any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine\n      long years, crowded with events of the most startling and, in\n      many cases, of the most unconceived and unconceivable character.\n      We were lying on the deck near the companion-way, and debating\n      the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom, when,\n      looking toward Augustus, who lay fronting myself, I perceived\r\nthat he had become all at once deadly pale, and that his lips\n      were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner.\n      Greatly alarmed, I spoke to him, but he made me no reply, and I\n      was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill, when I\n      took notice of his eyes, which were glaring apparently at some\n      object behind me. I turned my head, and shall never forget the\n      ecstatic joy which thrilled through every particle of my frame,\n      when I perceived a large brig bearing down upon us, and not more\n      than a couple of miles off. I sprung to my feet as if a musket","bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart; and, stretching out\n      my arms in the direction of the vessel, stood in this manner,\n      motionless, and unable to articulate a syllable. Peters and\n      Parker were equally affected, although in different ways. The\n      former danced about the deck like a madman, uttering the most\n      extravagant rhodomontades, intermingled with howls and\n      imprecations, while the latter burst into tears, and continued\n      for many minutes weeping like a child.\n\n      The vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig, of a Dutch\n      build, and painted black, with a tawdry gilt figure-head. She had\r\nevidently seen a good deal of rough weather, and, we supposed,\n      had suffered much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to\n      ourselves; for her foretopmast was gone, and some of her\n      starboard bulwarks. When we first saw her, she was, as I have\n      already said, about two miles off and to windward, bearing down\n      upon us. The breeze was very gentle, and what astonished us\n      chiefly was, that she had no other sails set than her foremast\n      and mainsail, with a flying jib—of course she came down but\n      slowly, and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy. The\r\nawkward manner in which she steered, too, was remarked by all of\n      us, even excited as we were. She yawed about so considerably,\n      that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us, or\n      imagined that, having seen us, and discovered no person on board,\n      she was about to tack and make off in another direction. Upon\n      each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our\n      voices, when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her\n      intention, and again hold on toward us—this singular conduct\n      being repeated two or three times, so that at last we could think","of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the\n      helmsman to be in liquor.\n\n      No person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about\n      a quarter of a mile of us. We then saw three seamen, whom by\n      their dress we took to be Hollanders. Two of these were lying on\n      some old sails near the forecastle, and the third, who appeared\n      to be looking at us with great curiosity, was leaning over the\n      starboard bow near the bowsprit. This last was a stout and tall\n      man, with a very dark skin. He seemed by his manner to be\n      encouraging us to have patience, nodding to us in a cheerful\r\nalthough rather odd way, and smiling constantly, so as to display\n      a set of the most brilliantly white teeth. As his vessel drew\n      nearer, we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his\n      head into the water; but of this he took little or no notice,\n      continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations. I relate these\n      things and circumstances minutely, and I relate them, it must be\n      understood, precisely as they _appeared_to us.\n\n      The brig came on slowly, and now more steadily than before, and—I\n      cannot speak calmly of this event—our hearts leaped up wildly\r\nwithin us, and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and\n      thanksgiving to God for the complete, unexpected, and glorious\n      deliverance that was so palpably at hand. Of a sudden, and all at\n      once, there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel\n      (which was now close upon us) a smell, a stench, such as the\n      whole world has no name for—no conception of—hellish—utterly\n      suffocating—insufferable, inconceivable. I gasped for breath, and\n      turning to my companions, perceived that they were paler than\n      marble. But we had now no time left for question or surmise—the","brig was within fifty feet of us, and it seemed to be her\n      intention to run under our counter, that we might board her\n      without putting out a boat. We rushed aft, when, suddenly, a wide\n      yaw threw her off full five or six points from the course she had\n      been running, and, as she passed under our stern at the distance\n      of about twenty feet, we had a full view of her decks. Shall I\n      ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle? Twenty-five or\n      thirty human bodies, among whom were several females, lay\n      scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last\r\nand most loathsome state of putrefaction. We plainly saw that not\n      a soul lived in that fated vessel! Yet we could not help shouting\n      to the dead for help! Yes, long and loudly did we beg, in the\n      agony of the moment, that those silent and disgusting images\n      would stay for us, would not abandon us to become like them,\n      would receive us among their goodly company! We were raving with\n      horror and despair—thoroughly mad through the anguish of our\n      grievous disappointment.\n\n      As our first loud yell of terror broke forth, it was replied to\n      by something, from near the bowsprit of the stranger, so closely\r\nresembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might\n      have been startled and deceived. At this instant another sudden\n      yaw brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view,\n      and we beheld at once the origin of the sound. We saw the tall\n      stout figure still leaning on the bulwark, and still nodding his\n      head to and fro, but his face was now turned from us so that we\n      could not behold it. His arms were extended over the rail, and\n      the palms of his hands fell outward. His knees were lodged upon a\n      stout rope, tightly stretched, and reaching from the heel of the","bowsprit to a cathead. On his back, from which a portion of the\n      shirt had been torn, leaving it bare, there sat a huge sea-gull,\n      busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh, its bill and\n      talons deep buried, and its white plumage spattered all over with\n      blood. As the brig moved farther round so as to bring us close in\n      view, the bird, with much apparent difficulty, drew out its\n      crimsoned head, and, after eyeing us for a moment as if\n      stupefied, arose lazily from the body upon which it had been\n      feasting, and, flying directly above our deck, hovered there a\r\nwhile with a portion of clotted and liver-like substance in its\n      beak. The horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash\n      immediately at the feet of Parker. May God forgive me, but now,\n      for the first time, there flashed through my mind a thought, a\n      thought which I will not mention, and I felt myself making a step\n      toward the ensanguined spot. I looked upward, and the eyes of\n      Augustus met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning\n      which immediately brought me to my senses. I sprang forward\n      quickly, and, with a deep shudder, threw the frightful thing into\n      the sea.\r\nThe body from which it had been taken, resting as it did upon the\n      rope, had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the\n      carnivorous bird, and it was this motion which had at first\n      impressed us with the belief of its being alive. As the gull\n      relieved it of its weight, it swung round and fell partially\n      over, so that the face was fully discovered. Never, surely, was\n      any object so terribly full of awe! The eyes were gone, and the\n      whole flesh around the mouth, leaving the teeth utterly naked.\n      This, then, was the smile which had cheered us on to hope! this","the—but I forbear. The brig, as I have already told, passed under\n      our stern, and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward. With\n      her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of\n      deliverance and joy. Deliberately as she went by, we might\n      possibly have found means of boarding her, had not our sudden\n      disappointment and the appalling nature of the discovery which\n      accompanied it laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of\n      mind and body. We had seen and felt, but we could neither think\n      nor act, until, alas! too late. How much our intellects had been\r\nweakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact, that when\n      the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more\n      than the half of her hull, the proposition was seriously\n      entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming!\n\n      I have, since this period, vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew\n      to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the\n      stranger. Her build and general appearance, as I have before\n      stated, led us to the belief that she was a Dutch trader, and the\n      dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion. We might have\r\neasily seen the name upon her stern, and, indeed, taken other\n      observations, which would have guided us in making out her\n      character; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to\n      every thing of that nature. From the saffron-like hue of such of\n      the corpses as were not entirely decayed, we concluded that the\n      whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever, or some\n      other virulent disease of the same fearful kind. If such were the\n      case (and I know not what else to imagine), death, to judge from\n      the positions of the bodies, must have come upon them in a manner","awfully sudden and overwhelming, in a way totally distinct from\n      that which generally characterizes even the most deadly\n      pestilences with which mankind are acquainted. It is possible,\n      indeed, that poison, accidentally introduced into some of their\n      sea-stores, may have brought about the disaster, or that the\n      eating of some unknown venomous species of fish, or other marine\n      animal, or oceanic bird, might have induced it—but it is utterly\n      useless to form conjectures where all is involved, and will, no\n      doubt, remain for ever involved, in the most appalling and\n      unfathomable mystery.\r\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\n      We spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid\n      lethargy, gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness,\n      hiding her from our sight, recalled us in some measure to our\n      senses. The pangs of hunger and thirst then returned, absorbing\n      all other cares and considerations. Nothing, however, could be\n      done until the morning, and, securing ourselves as well as\n      possible, we endeavoured to snatch a little repose. In this I\n      succeeded beyond my expectations, sleeping until my companions,\n      who had not been so fortunate, aroused me at daybreak to renew\r\nour attempts at getting up provisions from the hull.\n\n      It was now a dead calm, with the sea as smooth as I have ever\n      known it,—the weather warm and pleasant. The brig was out of\n      sight. We commenced our operations by wrenching off, with some\n      trouble, another of the forechains; and having fastened both to\n      Peters’ feet, he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the\n      storeroom, thinking it possible that he might be able to force it\n      open, provided he could get at it in sufficient time; and this he\n      hoped to do, as the hulk lay much more steadily than before.","He succeeded very quickly in reaching the door, when, loosening\n      one of the chains from his ankle, he made every exertion to force\n      the passage with it, but in vain, the framework of the room being\n      far stronger than was anticipated. He was quite exhausted with\n      his long stay under water, and it became absolutely necessary\n      that some other one of us should take his place. For this service\n      Parker immediately volunteered; but, after making three\n      ineffectual efforts, found that he could never even succeed in\n      getting near the door. The condition of Augustus’s wounded arm\r\nrendered it useless for him to attempt going down, as he would be\n      unable to force the room open should he reach it, and it\n      accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common\n      deliverance.\n\n      Peters had left one of the chains in the passage, and I found,\n      upon plunging in, that I had not sufficient balance to keep me\n      firmly down. I determined, therefore, to attempt no more, in my\n      first effort, than merely to recover the other chain. In groping\n      along the floor of the passage for this, I felt a hard substance,\n      which I immediately grasped, not having time to ascertain what it\r\nwas, but returning and ascending instantly to the surface. The\n      prize proved to be a bottle, and our joy may be conceived when I\n      say that it was found to be full of port wine. Giving thanks to\n      God for this timely and cheering assistance, we immediately drew\n      the cork with my penknife, and, each taking a moderate sup, felt\n      the most indescribable comfort from the warmth, strength, and\n      spirits with which it inspired us. We then carefully recorked the\n      bottle, and, by means of a handkerchief, swung it in such a\n      manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken.","Having rested a while after this fortunate discovery, I again\n      descended, and now recovered the chain, with which I instantly\n      came up. I then fastened it on and went down for the third time,\n      when I became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever, in that\n      situation, would enable me to force open the door of the\n      storeroom. I therefore returned in despair.\n\n      There seemed now to be no longer any room for hope, and I could\n      perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made\n      up their minds to perish. The wine had evidently produced in them\r\na species of delirium, which, perhaps, I had been prevented from\n      feeling by the immersion I had undergone since drinking it. They\n      talked incoherently, and about matters unconnected with our\n      condition, Peters repeatedly asking me questions about Nantucket.\n      Augustus, too, I remember, approached me with a serious air, and\n      requested me to lend him a pocket-comb, as his hair was full of\n      fish-scales, and he wished to get them out before going on shore.\n      Parker appeared somewhat less affected, and urged me to dive at\n      random into the cabin, and bring up any article which might come\r\nto hand. To this I consented, and, in the first attempt, after\n      staying under a full minute, brought up a small leather trunk\n      belonging to Captain Barnard. This was immediately opened in the\n      faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink. We\n      found nothing, however, except a box of razors and two linen\n      shirts. I now went down again, and returned without any success.\n      As my head came above water I heard a crash on deck, and, upon\n      getting up, saw that my companions had ungratefully taken\n      advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine,\n      having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before","I saw them. I remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of\n      their conduct, when Augustus burst into tears. The other two\n      endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke, but I hope never\n      again to behold laughter of such a species: the distortion of\n      countenance was absolutely frightful. Indeed, it was apparent\n      that the stimulus, in the empty state of their stomachs, had\n      taken instant and violent effect, and that they were all\n      exceedingly intoxicated. With great difficulty I prevailed upon\n      them to lie down, when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber,\r\naccompanied with loud stertorous breathing.\n\n      I now found myself, as it were, alone in the brig, and my\n      reflections, to be sure, were of the most fearful and gloomy\n      nature. No prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering\n      death by famine, or, at the best, by being overwhelmed in the\n      first gale which should spring up, for in our present exhausted\n      condition we could have no hope of living through another.\n\n      The gnawing hunger which I now experienced was nearly\n      insupportable, and I felt myself capable of going to any lengths\r\nin order to appease it. With my knife I cut off a small portion\n      of the leather trunk, and endeavoured to eat it, but found it\n      utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel, although I fancied\n      that some little alleviation of my suffering was obtained by\n      chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out. Toward night my\n      companions awoke, one by one, each in an indescribable state of\n      weakness and horror, brought on by the wine, whose fumes had now\n      evaporated. They shook as if with a violent ague, and uttered the\n      most lamentable cries for water. Their condition affected me in","the most lively degree, at the same time causing me to rejoice in\n      the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from\n      indulging in the wine, and consequently from sharing their\n      melancholy and most distressing sensations. Their conduct,\n      however, gave me great uneasiness and alarm; for it was evident\n      that, unless some favourable change took place, they could afford\n      me no assistance in providing for our common safety. I had not\n      yet abandoned all idea of being able to get up something from\n      below; but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some\r\none of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by\n      holding the end of the rope while I went down. Parker appeared to\n      be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others, and\n      I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to rouse him. Thinking\n      that a plunge in the sea-water might have a beneficial effect, I\n      contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body, and then,\n      leading him to the companion-way (he remaining quite passive all\n      the while), pushed him in, and immediately drew him out. I had\n      good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this\r\nexperiment; for he appeared much revived and invigorated, and,\n      upon getting out, asked me, in a rational manner, why I had so\n      served him. Having explained my object, he expressed himself\n      indebted to me, and said that he felt greatly better from the\n      immersion, afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation. We\n      then resolved to treat Augustus and Peters in the same way, which\n      we immediately did, when they both experienced much benefit from\n      the shock. This idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me\n      by reading in some medical work the good effect of the","shower-bath in a case where the patient was suffering from _mania\n      a potu_.\n\n      Finding that I could now trust my companions to hold the end of\n      the rope, I again made three or four plunges into the cabin,\n      although it was now quite dark, and a gentle but long swell from\n      the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady. In the course\n      of these attempts I succeeded in bringing up two case-knives, a\n      three-gallon jug, empty, and a blanket, but nothing which could\n      serve us for food. I continued my efforts, after getting these\n      articles, until I was completely exhausted, but brought up\r\nnothing else. During the night Parker and Peters occupied\n      themselves by turns in the same manner; but nothing coming to\n      hand, we now gave up this attempt in despair, concluding that we\n      were exhausting ourselves in vain.\n\n      We passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most\n      intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined.\n      The morning of the sixteenth at length dawned, and we looked\n      eagerly around the horizon for relief, but to no purpose. The sea\n      was still smooth, with only a long swell from the northward, as\n      on yesterday. This was the sixth day since we had tasted either\r\nfood or drink, with the exception of the bottle of port wine, and\n      it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while\n      longer unless something could be obtained. I never saw before,\n      nor wish to see again, human beings so utterly emaciated as\n      Peters and Augustus. Had I met them on shore in their present\n      condition I should not have had the slightest suspicion that I\n      had ever beheld them. Their countenances were totally changed in\n      character, so that I could not bring myself to believe them\n      really the same individuals with whom I had been in company but a","few days before. Parker, although sadly reduced, and so feeble\n      that he could not raise his head from his bosom, was not so far\n      gone as the other two. He suffered with great patience, making no\n      complaint, and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every\n      manner he could devise. For myself, although at the commencement\n      of the voyage I had been in bad health, and was at all times of a\n      delicate constitution, I suffered less than any of us, being much\n      less reduced in frame, and retaining my powers of mind in a\n      surprising degree, while the rest were completely prostrated in\r\nintellect, and seemed to be brought to a species of second\n      childhood, generally simpering in their expressions, with idiotic\n      smiles, and uttering the most absurd platitudes. At intervals,\n      however, they would appear to revive suddenly, as if inspired all\n      at once with a consciousness of their condition, when they would\n      spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour, and speak,\n      for a short period, of their prospects, in a manner altogether\n      rational, although full of the most intense despair. It is\n      possible, however, that my companions may have entertained the\r\nsame opinion of their own condition as I did of mine, and that I\n      may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and\n      imbecilities as themselves—this is a matter which cannot be\n      determined.\n\n      About noon Parker declared that he saw land off the larboard\n      quarter, and it was with the utmost difficulty I could restrain\n      him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming toward\n      it. Peters and Augustus took little notice of what he said, being\n      apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation. Upon looking in the\n      direction pointed out, I could not perceive the faintest","appearance of the shore—indeed, I was too well aware that we were\n      far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature. It was a\n      long time, nevertheless, before I could convince Parker of his\n      mistake. He then burst into a flood of tears, weeping like a\n      child, with loud cries and sobs, for two or three hours, when\n      becoming exhausted, he fell asleep.\n\n      Peters and Augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to\n      swallow portions of the leather. I advised them to chew it and\n      spit it out; but they were too excessively debilitated to be able\r\nto follow my advice. I continued to chew pieces of it at\n      intervals, and found some relief from so doing; my chief distress\n      was for water, and I was only prevented from taking a draught\n      from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus\n      have resulted to others who were similarly situated with\n      ourselves.\n\n      The day wore on in this manner, when I suddenly discovered a sail\n      to the eastward, and on our larboard bow. She appeared to be a\n      large ship, and was coming nearly athwart us, being probably\n      twelve or fifteen miles distant. None of my companions had as yet\r\ndiscovered her, and I forbore to tell them of her for the\n      present, lest we might again be disappointed of relief. At length\n      upon her getting nearer, I saw distinctly that she was heading\n      immediately for us, with her light sails filled. I could now\n      contain myself no longer, and pointed her out to my\n      fellow-sufferers. They immediately sprang to their feet, again\n      indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy, weeping,\n      laughing in an idiotic manner, jumping, stamping upon the deck,\n      tearing their hair, and praying and cursing by turns. I was so","affected by their conduct, as well as by what I considered a sure\n      prospect of deliverance, that I could not refrain from joining in\n      with their madness, and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude\n      and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck, clapping my hands,\n      shouting, and other similar acts, until I was suddenly called to\n      my recollection, and once more to the extreme human misery and\n      despair, by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully\n      presented toward us, and steering in a direction nearly opposite\n      to that in which I had at first perceived her.\r\nIt was some time before I could induce my poor companions to\n      believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken\n      place. They replied to all my assertions with a stare and a\n      gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such\n      misrepresentations. The conduct of Augustus most sensibly\n      affected me. In spite of all I could say or do to the contrary,\n      he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us, and\n      in making preparations to go on board of her. Some seaweed\n      floating by the brig, he maintained that it was the ship’s boat,\r\nand endeavoured to throw himself upon it, howling and shrieking\n      in the most heartrending manner, when I forcibly restrained him\n      from thus casting himself into the sea.\n\n      Having become in some degree pacified, we continued to watch the\n      ship until we finally lost sight of her, the weather becoming\n      hazy, with a light breeze springing up. As soon as she was\n      entirely gone, Parker turned suddenly toward me with an\n      expression of countenance which made me shudder. There was about\n      him an air of self-possession which I had not noticed in him\n      until now, and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he","would say. He proposed, in a few words, that one of us should die\n      to preserve the existence of the others.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\n      I had for some time past, dwelt upon the prospect of our being\n      reduced to this last horrible extremity, and had secretly made up\n      my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances\n      rather than resort to such a course. Nor was this resolution in\n      any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under\n      which I laboured. The proposition had not been heard by either\n      Peters or Augustus. I therefore took Parker aside; and mentally\r\npraying to God for power to dissuade him from the horrible\n      purpose he entertained, I expostulated with him for a long time,\n      and in the most supplicating manner, begging him in the name of\n      every thing which he held sacred, and urging him by every species\n      of argument which the extremity of the case suggested, to abandon\n      the idea, and not to mention it to either of the other two.\n\n      He heard all I said without attempting to controvert any of my\n      arguments, and I had begun to hope that he would be prevailed\n      upon to do as I desired. But when I had ceased speaking, he said\r\nthat he knew very well all I had said was true, and that to\n      resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which\n      could enter into the mind of man; but that he had now held out as\n      long as human nature could be sustained; that it was unnecessary\n      for all to perish, when, by the death of one, it was possible,\n      and even probable, that the rest might be finally preserved;\n      adding that I might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him\n      from his purpose, his mind having been thoroughly made up on the\n      subject even before the appearance of the ship, and that only her","heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention\n      at an earlier period.\n\n      I now begged him, if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon\n      his design, at least to defer it for another day, when some\n      vessel might come to our relief; again reiterating every argument\n      I could devise, and which I thought likely to have influence with\n      one of his rough nature. He said, in reply, that he had not\n      spoken until the very last possible moment, that he could exist\n      no longer without sustenance of some kind, and that therefore in\r\nanother day his suggestion would be too late, as regarded himself\n      at least.\n\n      Finding that he was not to be moved by anything I could say in a\n      mild tone, I now assumed a different demeanor, and told him that\n      he must be aware I had suffered less than any of us from our\n      calamities; that my health and strength, consequently, were at\n      that moment far better than his own, or than that either of\n      Peters or Augustus; in short, that I was in a condition to have\n      my own way by force if I found it necessary; and that if he\n      attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody\r\nand cannibal designs, I would not hesitate to throw him into the\n      sea. Upon this he immediately seized me by the throat, and\n      drawing a knife, made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in\n      the stomach; an atrocity which his excessive debility alone\n      prevented him from accomplishing. In the meantime, being roused\n      to a high pitch of anger, I forced him to the vessel’s side, with\n      the full intention of throwing him overboard. He was saved from\n      his fate, however, by the interference of Peters, who now\n      approached and separated us, asking the cause of the disturbance.","This Parker told before I could find means in any manner to\n      prevent him.\n\n      The effect of his words was even more terrible than what I had\n      anticipated. Both Augustus and Peters, who, it seems, had long\n      secretly entertained the same fearful idea which Parker had been\n      merely the first to broach, joined with him in his design and\n      insisted upon its immediately being carried into effect. I had\n      calculated that one at least of the two former would be found\n      still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with\n      myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose,\r\nand, with the aid of either one of them, I had no fear of being\n      able to prevent its accomplishment. Being disappointed in this\n      expectation, it became absolutely necessary that I should attend\n      to my own safety, as a further resistance on my part might\n      possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a\n      sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that I\n      knew would speedily be enacted.\n\n      I now told them I was willing to submit to the proposal, merely\n      requesting a delay of about one hour, in order that the fog which\n      had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting, when\r\nit was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in\n      sight. After great difficulty I obtained from them a promise to\n      wait thus long; and, as I had anticipated (a breeze rapidly\n      coming in), the fog lifted before the hour had expired, when, no\n      vessel appearing in sight, we prepared to draw lots.\n\n      It is with extreme reluctance that I dwell upon the appalling\n      scene which ensued; a scene which, with its minutest details, no\n      after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree\n      from my memory, and whose stern recollection will embitter every","future moment of my existence. Let me run over this portion of my\n      narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be\n      spoken of will permit. The only method we could devise for the\n      terrific lottery, in which we were to take each a chance, was\n      that of drawing straws. Small splinters of wood were made to\n      answer our purpose, and it was agreed that I should be the\n      holder. I retired to one end of the hulk, while my poor\n      companions silently took up their station in the other with their\n      backs turned toward me. The bitterest anxiety which I endured at\r\nany period of this fearful drama was while I occupied myself in\n      the arrangement of the lots. There are few conditions into which\n      man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in\n      the preservation of his existence; an interest momentarily\n      increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that\n      existence may be held. But now that the silent, definite, and\n      stern nature of the business in which I was engaged (so different\n      from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually\n      approaching horrors of famine) allowed me to reflect on the few\r\nchances I had of escaping the most appalling of deaths—a death\n      for the most appalling of purposes—every particle of that energy\n      which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the\n      wind, leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable\n      terror. I could not, at first, even summon up sufficient strength\n      to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood, my fingers\n      absolutely refusing their office, and my knees knocking violently\n      against each other. My mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd\n      projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful","speculation. I thought of falling on my knees to my companions,\n      and entreating them to let me escape this necessity; of suddenly\n      rushing upon them, and, by putting one of them to death, of\n      rendering the decision by lot useless—in short, of every thing\n      but of going through with the matter I had in hand. At last,\n      after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct, I was\n      recalled to my senses by the voice of Parker, who urged me to\n      relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were\n      enduring. Even then I could not bring myself to arrange the\r\nsplinters upon the spot, but thought over every species of\n      finesse by which I could trick some one of my fellow-sufferers to\n      draw the short straw, as it had been agreed that whoever drew the\n      shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the\n      preservation of the rest. Before any one condemn me for this\n      apparent heartlessness, let him be placed in a situation\n      precisely similar to my own.\n\n      At length delay was no longer possible, and, with a heart almost\n      bursting from my bosom, I advanced to the region of the\n      forecastle, where my companions were awaiting me. I held out my\r\nhand with the splinters, and Peters immediately drew. He was\n      free—his, at least, was not the shortest; and there was now\n      another chance against my escape. I summoned up all my strength,\n      and passed the lots to Augustus. He also drew immediately, and he\n      also was free; and now, whether I should live or die, the chances\n      were no more than precisely even. At this moment all the\n      fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom, and I felt toward my\n      poor fellow-creature, Parker, the most intense, the most\n      diabolical hatred. But the feeling did not last; and, at length,","with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes, I held out the two\n      remaining splinters toward him. It was fully five minutes before\n      he could summon resolution to draw, during which period of\n      heartrending suspense I never once opened my eyes. Presently one\n      of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand. The decision was\n      then over, yet I knew not whether it was for me or against me. No\n      one spoke, and still I dared not satisfy myself by looking at the\n      splinter I held. Peters at length took me by the hand, and I\n      forced myself to look up, when I immediately saw by the\r\ncountenance of Parker that I was safe, and that he it was who had\n      been doomed to suffer. Gasping for breath, I fell senseless to\n      the deck.\n\n      I recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of\n      the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental\n      in bringing it about. He made no resistance whatever, and was\n      stabbed in the back by Peters, when he fell instantly dead. I\n      must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued.\n      Such things may be imagined, but words have no power to impress\n      the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality. Let it\r\nsuffice to say that, having in some measure appeased the raging\n      thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim, and having\n      by common consent taken off the hands, feet, and head, throwing\n      them together with the entrails, into the sea, we devoured the\n      rest of the body, piecemeal, during the four ever memorable days\n      of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth of the\n      month.\n\n      On the nineteenth, there coming on a smart shower which lasted\n      fifteen or twenty minutes, we contrived to catch some water by\n      means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our","drag just after the gale. The quantity we took in all did not\n      amount to more than half a gallon; but even this scanty allowance\n      supplied us with comparative strength and hope.\n\n      On the twenty-first we were again reduced to the last necessity.\n      The weather still remained warm and pleasant, with occasional\n      fogs and light breezes, most usually from N. to W.\n\n      On the twenty-second, as we were sitting close huddled together,\n      gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition, there flashed\n      through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a\r\nbright gleam of hope. I remembered that, when the foremast had\n      been cut away, Peters, being in the windward chains, passed one\n      of the axes into my hand, requesting me to put it, if possible,\n      in a place of security, and that a few minutes before the last\n      heavy sea struck the brig and filled her I had taken this axe\n      into the forecastle and laid it in one of the larboard berths. I\n      now thought it possible that, by getting at this axe, we might\n      cut through the deck over the storeroom, and thus readily supply\n      ourselves with provisions.\n\n      When I communicated this object to my companions, they uttered a\r\nfeeble shout of joy, and we all proceeded forthwith to the\n      forecastle. The difficulty of descending here was greater than\n      that of going down in the cabin, the opening being much smaller,\n      for it will be remembered that the whole framework about the\n      cabin companion-hatch had been carried away, whereas the\n      forecastle-way, being a simple hatch of only about three feet\n      square, had remained uninjured. I did not hesitate, however, to\n      attempt the descent; and a rope being fastened round my body as\n      before, I plunged boldly in, feet foremost, made my way quickly","to the berth, and at the first attempt brought up the axe. It was\n      hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph, and the ease with\n      which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our\n      ultimate preservation.\n\n      We now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of\n      rekindled hope, Peters and myself taking the axe by turns,\n      Augustus’s wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any\n      degree. As we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to\n      stand unsupported, and could consequently work but a minute or\n      two without resting, it soon became evident that many long hours\r\nwould be necessary to accomplish our task—that is, to cut an\n      opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the\n      storeroom. This consideration, however, did not discourage us;\n      and, working all night by the light of the moon, we succeeded in\n      effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the\n      twenty-third.\n\n      Peters now volunteered to go down; and, having made all\n      arrangements as before, he descended, and soon returned bringing\n      up with him a small jar, which, to our great joy, proved to be\n      full of olives. Having shared these among us, and devoured them\r\nwith the greatest avidity, we proceeded to let him down again.\n      This time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations, returning\n      instantly with a large ham and a bottle of Madeira wine. Of the\n      latter we each took a moderate sup, having learned by experience\n      the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely. The ham,\n      except about two pounds near the bone, was not in a condition to\n      be eaten, having been entirely spoiled by the salt water. The\n      sound part was divided among us. Peters and Augustus, not being\n      able to restrain their appetite, swallowed theirs upon the","instant; but I was more cautious, and ate but a small portion of\n      mine, dreading the thirst which I knew would ensue. We now rested\n      a while from our labors, which had been intolerably severe.\n\n      By noon, feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed, we again\n      renewed our attempt at getting up provisions, Peters and myself\n      going down alternately, and always with more or less success,\n      until sundown. During this interval we had the good fortune to\n      bring up, altogether, four more small jars of olives, another\n      ham, a carboy containing nearly three gallons of excellent Cape\r\nMadeira wine, and, what gave us still more delight, a small\n      tortoise of the Gallipago breed, several of which had been taken\n      on board by Captain Barnard, as the _Grampus_ was leaving port,\n      from the schooner _Mary Pitts_, just returned from a sealing\n      voyage in the Pacific.\n\n      In a subsequent portion of this narrative I shall have frequent\n      occasion to mention this species of tortoise. It is found\n      principally, as most of my readers may know, in the group of\n      islands called the Gallipagos, which, indeed, derive their name\n      from the animal—the Spanish word Gallipago meaning a fresh-water\r\nterrapin. From the peculiarity of their shape and action they\n      have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise. They are\n      frequently found of an enormous size. I have myself seen several\n      which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds, although\n      I do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them\n      weighing more than eight hundred. Their appearance is singular,\n      and even disgusting. Their steps are very slow, measured, and\n      heavy, their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground.\n      Their neck is long, and exceedingly slender, from eighteen inches","to two feet is a very common length, and I killed one, where the\n      distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no\n      less than three feet ten inches. The head has a striking\n      resemblance to that of a serpent. They can exist without food for\n      an almost incredible length of time, instances having been known\n      where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain\n      two years without nourishment of any kind—being as fat, and, in\n      every respect, in as good order at the expiration of the time as\n      when they were first put in. In one particular these\r\nextraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary, or\n      camel of the desert. In a bag at the root of the neck they carry\n      with them a constant supply of water. In some instances, upon\n      killing them after a full year’s deprivation of all nourishment,\n      as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have\n      been found in their bags. Their food is chiefly wild parsley and\n      celery, with purslain, sea-kelp, and prickly pears, upon which\n      latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully, a great quantity of it\n      being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the\r\nanimal itself is discovered. They are excellent and highly\n      nutritious food, and have, no doubt, been the means of preserving\n      the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whale-fishery\n      and other pursuits in the Pacific.\n\n      The one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the\n      storeroom was not of a large size, weighing probably sixty-five\n      or seventy pounds. It was a female, and in excellent condition,\n      being exceedingly fat, and having more than a quart of limpid and\n      sweet water in its bag. This was indeed a treasure; and, falling\n      on our knees with one accord, we returned fervent thanks to God","for so seasonable a relief.\n\n      We had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the\n      opening, as its struggles were fierce and its strength\n      prodigious. It was upon the point of making its escape from\n      Peter’s grasp, and slipping back into the water, when Augustus,\n      throwing a rope with a slipknot around its throat, held it up in\n      this manner until I jumped into the hole by the side of Peters,\n      and assisted him in lifting it out.\n\n      The water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug; which, it\n      will be remembered, had been brought up before from the cabin.\r\nHaving done this, we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to\n      form, with the cork, a kind of glass, holding not quite half a\n      gill. We then each drank one of these measures full, and resolved\n      to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should\n      hold out.\n\n      During the last two or three days, the weather having been dry\n      and pleasant, the bedding we had obtained from the cabin, as well\n      as our clothing, had become thoroughly dry, so that we passed\n      this night (that of the twenty-third) in comparative comfort,\n      enjoying a tranquil repose, after having supped plentifully on\r\nolives and ham, with a small allowance of the wine. Being afraid\n      of losing some of our stores overboard during the night, in the\n      event of a breeze springing up, we secured them as well as\n      possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass. Our\n      tortoise, which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we\n      could, we threw on its back, and otherwise carefully fastened.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\n      July 24. This morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and\n      strength. Notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were\n      still placed, ignorant of our position, although certainly at a","great distance from land, without more food than would last us\n      for a fortnight even with great care, almost entirely without\n      water, and floating about at the mercy of every wind and wave on\n      the merest wreck in the world, still the infinitely more terrible\n      distresses and dangers from which we had so lately and so\n      providentially been delivered caused us to regard what we now\n      endured as but little more than an ordinary evil—so strictly\n      comparative is either good or ill.\n\n      At sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up\r\nsomething from the storeroom, when, a smart shower coming on,\n      with some lightning, we turn our attention to the catching of\n      water by means of the sheet we had used before for this purpose.\n      We had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the\n      sheet spread out with one of the forechain-plates in the middle\n      of it. The water, thus conducted to the centre, was drained\n      through into our jug. We had nearly filled it in this manner,\n      when, a heavy squall coming on from the northward, obliged us to\n      desist, as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we\r\ncould no longer keep our feet. We now went forward, and, lashing\n      ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before,\n      awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been\n      anticipated or would have been imagined possible under the\n      circumstances. At noon the wind had freshened into a two-reef\n      breeze, and by night into a stiff gale, accompanied with a\n      tremendously heavy swell. Experience having taught us, however,\n      the best method of arranging our lashings, we weathered this\n      dreary night in tolerable security, although thoroughly drenched","at almost every instant by the sea, and in momentary dread of\n      being washed off. Fortunately, the weather was so warm as to\n      render the water rather grateful than otherwise.\n\n      July 25. This morning the gale had diminished to a mere ten-knot\n      breeze, and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we\n      were able to keep ourselves dry upon the deck. To our great\n      grief, however, we found that two jars of our olives, as well as\n      the whole of our ham, had been washed overboard, in spite of the\n      careful manner in which they had been fastened. We determined not\r\nto kill the tortoise as yet, and contented ourselves for the\n      present with a breakfast on a few of the olives, and a measure of\n      water each, which latter we mixed half and half, with wine,\n      finding great relief and strength from the mixture, without the\n      distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port.\n      The sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at\n      getting up provision from the storeroom. Several articles, of no\n      importance to us in our present situation, floated up through the\n      opening during the day, and were immediately washed overboard. We\r\nalso now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever, so that\n      we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves. On this\n      account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day. At noon the sun\n      appeared to be nearly vertical, and we had no doubt that we had\n      been driven down by the long succession of northward and\n      northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator. Toward\n      evening we saw several sharks, and were somewhat alarmed by the\n      audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us.\n      At one time, a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the","water, the monster actually swam in upon us, floundering for some\n      moments just over the companion-hatch, and striking Peters\n      violently with his tail. A heavy sea at length hurled him\n      overboard, much to our relief. In moderate weather we might have\n      easily captured him.\n\n      July 26. This morning, the wind having greatly abated, and the\n      sea not being very rough, we determined to renew our exertions in\n      the storeroom. After a great deal of hard labor during the whole\n      day, we found that nothing further was to be expected from this\n      quarter, the partitions of the room having been stove during the\r\nnight, and its contents swept into the hold. This discovery, as\n      may be supposed, filled us with despair.\n\n      July 27. The sea nearly smooth, with a light wind, and still from\n      the northward and westward. The sun coming out hotly in the\n      afternoon, we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes. Found\n      great relief from thirst, and much comfort otherwise, by bathing\n      in the sea; in this, however, we were forced to use great\n      caution, being afraid of sharks, several of which were seen\n      swimming around the brig during the day.\n\n      July 28. Good weather still. The brig now began to lie along so\r\nalarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up.\n      Prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency,\n      lashing our tortoise, waterjug, and two remaining jars of olives\n      as far as possible over to the windward, placing them outside the\n      hull below the main-chains. The sea very smooth all day, with\n      little or no wind.\n\n      July 29. A continuance of the same weather. Augustus’s wounded\n      arm began to evince symptoms of mortification. He complained of\n      drowsiness and excessive thirst, but no acute pain. Nothing could\n      be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of","the vinegar from the olives, and from this no benefit seemed to\n      be experienced. We did every thing in our power for his comfort,\n      and trebled his allowance of water.\n\n      July 30. An excessively hot day, with no wind. An enormous shark\n      kept close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon. We made\n      several unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose.\n      Augustus much worse, and evidently sinking as much from want of\n      proper nourishment as from the effect of his wounds. He\n      constantly prayed to be relieved from his sufferings, wishing for\r\nnothing but death. This evening we ate the last of our olives,\n      and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could not\n      swallow it at all without the addition of wine. Determined to\n      kill our tortoise in the morning.\n\n      July 31. After a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue, owing to\n      the position of the hulk, we set about killing and cutting up our\n      tortoise. He proved to be much smaller than we had supposed,\n      although in good condition,—the whole meat about him not\n      amounting to more than ten pounds. With a view of preserving a\n      portion of this as long as possible, we cut it into fine pieces,\r\nand filled with them our three remaining olive jars and the\n      wine-bottle (all of which had been kept), pouring in afterward\n      the vinegar from the olives. In this manner we put away about\n      three pounds of the tortoise, intending not to touch it until we\n      had consumed the rest. We concluded to restrict ourselves to\n      about four ounces of the meat per day; the whole would thus last\n      us thirteen days. A brisk shower, with severe thunder and\n      lightning, came on about dusk, but lasted so short a time that we\n      only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water. The whole","of this, by common consent, was given to Augustus, who now\n      appeared to be in the last extremity. He drank the water from the\n      sheet as we caught it (we holding it above him as he lay so as to\n      let it run into his mouth), for we had now nothing left capable\n      of holding water, unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from\n      the carboy, or the stale water from the jug. Either of these\n      expedients would have been resorted to had the shower lasted.\n\n      The sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the\n      draught. His arm was completely black from the wrist to the\r\nshoulder, and his feet were like ice. We expected every moment to\n      see him breathe his last. He was frightfully emaciated; so much\n      so that, although he weighed a hundred and twenty-seven pounds\n      upon his leaving Nantucket, he now did not weigh more than forty\n      or fifty at the farthest. His eyes were sunk far in his head,\n      being scarcely perceptible, and the skin of his cheeks hung so\n      loosely as to prevent his masticating any food, or even\n      swallowing any liquid, without great difficulty.\n\n      August 1. A continuance of the same calm weather, with an\r\noppressively hot sun. Suffered exceedingly from thirst, the water\n      in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin. We\n      contrived, nevertheless, to swallow a portion of it by mixing it\n      with wine; our thirst, however, was but little abated. We found\n      more relief by bathing in the sea, but could not avail ourselves\n      of this expedient except at long intervals, on account of the\n      continual presence of sharks. We now saw clearly that Augustus\n      could not be saved; that he was evidently dying. We could do\n      nothing to relieve his sufferings, which appeared to be great.","About twelve o’clock he expired in strong convulsions, and\n      without having spoken for several hours. His death filled us with\n      the most gloomy forebodings, and had so great an effect upon our\n      spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole\n      day, and never addressed each other except in a whisper. It was\n      not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and\n      throw the body overboard. It was then loathsome beyond\n      expression, and so far decayed that, as Peters attempted to lift\n      it, an entire leg came off in his grasp. As the mass of\r\nputrefaction slipped over the vessel’s side into the water, the\n      glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly\n      discovered to us seven or eight large sharks, the clashing of\n      whose horrible teeth, as their prey was torn to pieces among\n      them, might have been heard at the distance of a mile. We shrunk\n      within ourselves in the extremity of horror at the sound.\n\n      August 2. The same fearfully calm and hot weather. The dawn found\n      us in a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion.\n      The water in the jug was now absolutely useless, being a thick\r\ngelatinous mass; nothing but frightful-looking worms mingled with\n      slime. We threw it out, and washed the jug well in the sea,\n      afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our bottles of\n      pickled tortoise. Our thirst could now scarcely be endured, and\n      we tried in vain to relieve it by wine, which seemed only to add\n      fuel to the flame, and excited us to a high degree of\n      intoxication. We afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings\n      by mixing the wine with seawater; but this instantly brought\n      about the most violent retchings, so that we never again\n      attempted it. During the whole day we anxiously sought an","opportunity of bathing, but to no purpose; for the hulk was now\n      entirely besieged on all sides with sharks—no doubt the identical\n      monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the evening\n      before, and who were in momentary expectation of another similar\n      feast. This circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret and\n      filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings. We\n      had experienced indescribable relief in bathing, and to have this\n      resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could\n      bear. Nor, indeed, were we altogether free from the apprehension\r\nof immediate danger, for the least slip or false movement would\n      have thrown us at once within reach of those voracious fish, who\n      frequently thrust themselves directly upon us, swimming up to\n      leeward. No shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them.\n      Even when one of the largest was struck with an axe by Peters and\n      much wounded, he persisted in his attempts to push in where we\n      were. A cloud came up at dusk, but, to our extreme anguish,\n      passed over without discharging itself. It is quite impossible to\n      conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period. We passed a\r\nsleepless night, both on this account and through dread of the\n      sharks.\n\n      August 3. No prospect of relief, and the brig lying still more\n      and more along, so that now we could not maintain a footing upon\n      deck at all. Busied ourselves in securing our wine and\n      tortoise-meat, so that we might not lose them in the event of our\n      rolling over. Got out two stout spikes from the forechains, and,\n      by means of the axe, drove them into the hull to windward within\n      a couple of feet of the water, this not being very far from the\n      keel, as we were nearly upon our beam-ends. To these spikes we","now lashed our provisions, as being more secure than their former\n      position beneath the chains. Suffered great agony from thirst\n      during the whole day—no chance of bathing on account of the\n      sharks, which never left us for a moment. Found it impossible to\n      sleep.\n\n      August 4. A little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was\n      heeling over, and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off\n      by the movement. At first the roll was slow and gradual, and we\n      contrived to clamber over to windward very well, having taken the\r\nprecaution to leave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven\n      in for the provision. But we had not calculated sufficiently upon\n      the acceleration of the impetus; for, presently the heel became\n      too violent to allow of our keeping pace with it; and, before\n      either of us knew what was to happen, we found ourselves hurled\n      furiously into the sea, and struggling several fathoms beneath\n      the surface, with the huge hull immediately above us.\n\n      In going under the water I had been obliged to let go my hold\n      upon the rope; and finding that I was completely beneath the\n      vessel, and my strength nearly exhausted, I scarcely made a\r\nstruggle for life, and resigned myself, in a few seconds, to die.\n      But here again I was deceived, not having taken into\n      consideration the natural rebound of the hull to windward. The\n      whirl of the water upward, which the vessel occasioned in rolling\n      partially back, brought me to the surface still more violently\n      than I had been plunged beneath. Upon coming up I found myself\n      about twenty yards from the hulk, as near as I could judge. She\n      was lying keel up, rocking furiously from side to side, and the\n      sea in all directions around was much agitated, and full of","strong whirlpools. I could see nothing of Peters. An oil-cask was\n      floating within a few feet of me, and various other articles from\n      the brig were scattered about.\n\n      My principal terror was now on account of the sharks, which I\n      knew to be in my vicinity. In order to deter these, if possible,\n      from approaching me, I splashed the water vigorously with both\n      hands and feet as I swam towards the hulk, creating a body of\n      foam. I have no doubt that to this expedient, simple as it was, I\n      was indebted for my preservation; for the sea all round the brig,\r\njust before her rolling over, was so crowded with these monsters,\n      that I must have been, and really was, in actual contact with\n      some of them during my progress. By great good fortune, however,\n      I reached the side of the vessel in safety, although so utterly\n      weakened by the violent exertion I had used that I should never\n      have been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of\n      Peters, who, now, to my great joy, made his appearance (having\n      scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hull), and\n      threw me the end of a rope—one of those which had been attached\r\nto the spikes.\n\n      Having barely escaped this danger, our attention was now directed\n      to the dreadful imminency of another—that of absolute starvation.\n      Our whole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of\n      all our care in securing it; and seeing no longer the remotest\n      possibility of obtaining more, we gave way both of us to despair,\n      weeping aloud like children, and neither of us attempting to\n      offer consolation to the other. Such weakness can scarcely be\n      conceived, and to those who have never been similarly situated\n      will, no doubt, appear unnatural; but it must be remembered that","our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of\n      privation and terror to which we had been subjected, that we\n      could not justly be considered, at that period, in the light of\n      rational beings. In subsequent perils, nearly as great, if not\n      greater, I bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my\n      situation, and Peters, it will be seen, evinced a stoical\n      philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike\n      supineness and imbecility—the mental condition made the\n      difference.\n\n      The overturning of the brig, even with the consequent loss of the\r\nwine and turtle, would not, in fact, have rendered our situation\n      more deplorable than before, except for the disappearance of the\n      bedclothes by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch\n      rainwater, and of the jug in which we had kept it when caught;\n      for we found the whole bottom, from within two or three feet of\n      the bends as far as the keel, together with the keel itself,\n      thickly covered with large barnacles, which proved to be\n      excellent and highly nutritious food. Thus, in two important\n      respects, the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved to be a\r\nbenefit rather than an injury; it had opened to us a supply of\n      provisions which we could not have exhausted, using it\n      moderately, in a month; and it had greatly contributed to our\n      comfort as regards position, we being much more at ease, and in\n      infinitely less danger, than before.\n\n      The difficulty, however, of now obtaining water blinded us to all\n      the benefits of the change in our condition. That we might be\n      ready to avail ourselves, as far as possible, of any shower which\n      might fall we took off our shirts, to make use of them as we had","of the sheets—not hoping, of course, to get more in this way,\n      even under the most favorable circumstances, than half a gill at\n      a time. No signs of a cloud appeared during the day, and the\n      agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable. At night, Peters\n      obtained about an hour’s disturbed sleep, but my intense\n      sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single\n      moment.\n\n      August 5. To-day, a gentle breeze springing up carried us through\n      a vast quantity of seaweed, among which we were so fortunate as\n      to find eleven small crabs, which afforded us several delicious\r\nmeals. Their shells being quite soft, we ate them entire, and\n      found that they irritated our thirst far less than the barnacles.\n      Seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed, we also ventured to\n      bathe, and remained in the water for four or five hours, during\n      which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our thirst.\n      Were greatly refreshed, and spent the night somewhat more\n      comfortably than before, both of us snatching a little sleep.\n\n      August 6. This day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain,\n      lasting from about noon until after dark. Bitterly did we now\r\nregret the loss of our jug and carboy; for, in spite of the\n      little means we had of catching the water, we might have filled\n      one, if not both of them. As it was, we contrived to satisfy the\n      cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to become saturated,\n      and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid trickle\n      into our mouths. In this occupation we passed the entire day.\n\n      August 7. Just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a\n      sail to the eastward, and _evidently coming towards us!_ We\n      hailed the glorious sight with a long, although feeble shout of","rapture; and began instantly to make every signal in our power,\n      by flaring the shirts in the air, leaping as high as our weak\n      condition would permit, and even by hallooing with all the\n      strength of our lungs, although the vessel could not have been\n      less than fifteen miles distant. However, she still continued to\n      near our hulk, and we felt that, if she but held her present\n      course, she must eventually come so close as to perceive us. In\n      about an hour after we first discovered her, we could clearly see\n      the people on her decks. She was a long, low, and rakish-looking\r\ntopsail schooner, with a black ball in her foretopsail, and had,\n      apparently, a full crew. We now became alarmed, for we could\n      hardly imagine it possible that she did not observe us, and were\n      apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as we were—an\n      act of fiendish barbarity, which, however incredible it may\n      appear, has been repeatedly perpetuated at sea, under\n      circumstances very nearly similar, and by beings who were\n      regarded as belonging to the human species. {*2} In this\n      instance, however, by the mercy of God, we were destined to be\r\nmost happily deceived; for, presently we were aware of a sudden\n      commotion on the deck of the stranger, who immediately afterward\n      ran up a British flag, and, hauling her wind, bore up directly\n      upon us. In half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin.\n      She proved to be the Jane Guy, of Liverpool, Captain Guy, bound\n      on a sealing and trading voyage to the South Seas and Pacific.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\n      The _Jane Guy_ was a fine-looking topsail schooner of a hundred\n      and eighty tons burden. She was unusually sharp in the bows, and\n      on a wind, in moderate weather, the fastest sailer I have ever","seen. Her qualities, however, as a rough sea-boat, were not so\n      good, and her draught of water was by far too great for the trade\n      to which she was destined. For this peculiar service, a larger\n      vessel, and one of a light proportionate draught, is\n      desirable—say a vessel of from three hundred to three hundred and\n      fifty tons. She should be bark-rigged, and in other respects of a\n      different construction from the usual South Sea ships. It is\n      absolutely necessary that she should be well armed. She should\n      have, say ten or twelve twelve-pound carronades, and two or three\r\nlong twelves, with brass blunderbusses, and water-tight\n      arm-chests for each top. Her anchors and cables should be of far\n      greater strength than is required for any other species of trade,\n      and, above all, her crew should be numerous and efficient—not\n      less, for such a vessel as I have described, than fifty or sixty\n      able-bodied men. The Jane Guy had a crew of thirty-five, all able\n      seamen, besides the captain and mate, but she was not altogether\n      as well armed or otherwise equipped, as a navigator acquainted\n      with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have\n      desired.\r\nCaptain Guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner, and of\n      considerable experience in the southern traffic, to which he had\n      devoted a great portion of his life. He was deficient, however,\n      in energy, and, consequently, in that spirit of enterprise which\n      is here so absolutely requisite. He was part owner of the vessel\n      in which he sailed, and was invested with discretionary powers to\n      cruise in the South Seas for any cargo which might come most\n      readily to hand. He had on board, as usual in such voyages,\n      beads, looking-glasses, tinder-works, axes, hatchets, saws,","adzes, planes, chisels, gouges, gimlets, files, spokeshaves,\n      rasps, hammers, nails, knives, scissors, razors, needles, thread,\n      crockery-ware, calico, trinkets, and other similar articles.\n\n      The schooner sailed from Liverpool on the tenth of July, crossed\n      the Tropic of Cancer on the twenty-fifth, in longitude twenty\n      degrees west, and reached Sal, one of the Cape Verd islands, on\n      the twenty-ninth, where she took in salt and other necessaries\n      for the voyage. On the third of August, she left the Cape Verds\n      and steered southwest, stretching over toward the coast of\n      Brazil, so as to cross the equator between the meridians of\r\ntwenty-eight and thirty degrees west longitude. This is the\n      course usually taken by vessels bound from Europe to the Cape of\n      Good Hope, or by that route to the East Indies. By proceeding\n      thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which\n      continually prevail on the coast of Guinea, while, in the end, it\n      is found to be the shortest track, as westerly winds are never\n      wanting afterward by which to reach the Cape. It was Captain\n      Guy’s intention to make his first stoppage at Kerguelen’s Land—I\n      hardly know for what reason. On the day we were picked up the\r\nschooner was off Cape St. Roque, in longitude thirty-one degrees\n      west; so that, when found, we had drifted probably, from north to\n      south, _not less than five-and-twenty degrees!_\n\n      On board the Jane Guy we were treated with all the kindness our\n      distressed situation demanded. In about a fortnight, during which\n      time we continued steering to the southeast, with gentle breezes\n      and fine weather, both Peters and myself recovered entirely from\n      the effects of our late privation and dreadful sufferings, and we\n      began to remember what had passed rather as a frightful dream","from which we had been happily awakened, than as events which had\n      taken place in sober and naked reality. I have since found that\n      this species of partial oblivion is usually brought about by\n      sudden transition, whether from joy to sorrow or from sorrow to\n      joy—the degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the degree\n      of difference in the exchange. Thus, in my own case, I now feel\n      it impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which I\n      endured during the days spent upon the hulk. The incidents are\n      remembered, but not the feelings which the incidents elicited at\r\nthe time of their occurrence. I only know, that when they did\n      occur, I then thought human nature could sustain nothing more of\n      agony.\n\n      We continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of\n      greater moment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships,\n      and more frequently with the black or right whale, so called in\n      contradistinction to the spermaceti. These, however, were chiefly\n      found south of the twenty-fifth parallel. On the sixteenth of\n      September, being in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, the\n      schooner encountered her first gale of any violence since leaving\r\nLiverpool. In this neighborhood, but more frequently to the south\n      and east of the promontory (we were to the westward), navigators\n      have often to contend with storms from the northward, which rage\n      with great fury. They always bring with them a heavy sea, and one\n      of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping\n      round of the wind, an occurrence almost certain to take place\n      during the greatest force of the gale. A perfect hurricane will\n      be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast, and in\n      the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction,","while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a\n      violence almost inconceivable. A bright spot to the southward is\n      the sure forerunner of the change, and vessels are thus enabled\n      to take the proper precautions.\n\n      It was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a\n      white squall, and, as usual, from the northward. By eight it had\n      increased very much, and brought down upon us one of the most\n      tremendous seas I had then ever beheld. Every thing had been made\n      as snug as possible, but the schooner laboured excessively, and\r\ngave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat, pitching her\n      forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest difficulty\n      struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another.\n      Just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the\n      look-out made its appearance in the southwest, and in an hour\n      afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping\n      listlessly against the mast. In two minutes more, in spite of\n      every preparation, we were hurled on our beam-ends, as if by\n      magic, and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over\r\nus as we lay. The blow from the southwest, however, luckily\n      proved to be nothing more than a squall, and we had the good\n      fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar. A heavy\n      cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this, but\n      toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as\n      before the gale. Captain Guy considered that he had made an\n      escape little less than miraculous.\n\n      On the thirteenth of October we came in sight of Prince Edward’s\n      Island, in latitude 46 degrees 53’ S., longitude 37 degrees 46’","E. Two days afterward we found ourselves near Possession Island,\n      and presently passed the islands of Crozet, in latitude 42\n      degrees 59’ S., longitude 48 degrees E. On the eighteenth we made\n      Kerguelen’s or Desolation Island, in the Southern Indian Ocean,\n      and came to anchor in Christmas Harbour, having four fathoms of\n      water.\n\n      This island, or rather group of islands, bears southeast from the\n      Cape of Good Hope, and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred\n      leagues. It was first discovered in 1772, by the Baron de\n      Kergulen, or Kerguelen, a Frenchman, who, thinking the land to\r\nform a portion of an extensive southern continent carried home\n      information to that effect, which produced much excitement at the\n      time. The government, taking the matter up, sent the baron back\n      in the following year for the purpose of giving his new discovery\n      a critical examination, when the mistake was discovered. In 1777,\n      Captain Cook fell in with the same group, and gave to the\n      principal one the name of Desolation Island, a title which it\n      certainly well deserves. Upon approaching the land, however, the\n      navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise, as the sides of\r\nmost of the hills, from September to March, are clothed with very\n      brilliant verdure. This deceitful appearance is caused by a small\n      plant resembling saxifrage, which is abundant, growing in large\n      patches on a species of crumbling moss. Besides this plant there\n      is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the island, if we except some\n      coarse rank grass near the harbor, some lichen, and a shrub which\n      bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed, and which has\n      a bitter and acrid taste.\n\n      The face of the country is hilly, although none of the hills can","be called lofty. Their tops are perpetually covered with snow.\n      There are several harbors, of which Christmas Harbour is the most\n      convenient. It is the first to be met with on the northeast side\n      of the island after passing Cape Francois, which forms the\n      northern shore, and, by its peculiar shape, serves to distinguish\n      the harbour. Its projecting point terminates in a high rock,\n      through which is a large hole, forming a natural arch. The\n      entrance is in latitude 48 degrees 40’ S., longitude 69 degrees\n      6’ E. Passing in here, good anchorage may be found under the\r\nshelter of several small islands, which form a sufficient\n      protection from all easterly winds. Proceeding on eastwardly from\n      this anchorage you come to Wasp Bay, at the head of the harbour.\n      This is a small basin, completely landlocked, into which you can\n      go with four fathoms, and find anchorage in from ten to three,\n      hard clay bottom. A ship might lie here with her best bower ahead\n      all the year round without risk. To the westward, at the head of\n      Wasp Bay, is a small stream of excellent water, easily procured.\n\n      Some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on\r\nKerguelen’s Island, and sea elephants abound. The feathered\n      tribes are discovered in great numbers. Penguins are very plenty,\n      and of these there are four different kinds. The royal penguin,\n      so called from its size and beautiful plumage, is the largest.\n      The upper part of the body is usually gray, sometimes of a lilac\n      tint; the under portion of the purest white imaginable. The head\n      is of a glossy and most brilliant black, the feet also. The chief\n      beauty of plumage, however, consists in two broad stripes of a\n      gold color, which pass along from the head to the breast. The","bill is long, and either pink or bright scarlet. These birds walk\n      erect; with a stately carriage. They carry their heads high with\n      their wings drooping like two arms, and, as their tails project\n      from their body in a line with the legs, the resemblance to a\n      human figure is very striking, and would be apt to deceive the\n      spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the evening. The\n      royal penguins which we met with on Kerguelen’s Land were rather\n      larger than a goose. The other kinds are the macaroni, the\n      jackass, and the rookery penguin. These are much smaller, less\r\nbeautiful in plumage, and different in other respects.\n\n      Besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found, among\n      which may be mentioned sea-hens, blue peterels, teal, ducks, Port\n      Egmont hens, shags, Cape pigeons, the nelly, sea swallows, terns,\n      sea gulls, Mother Carey’s chickens, Mother Carey’s geese, or the\n      great peterel, and, lastly, the albatross.\n\n      The great peterel is as large as the common albatross, and is\n      carnivorous. It is frequently called the break-bones, or osprey\n      peterel. They are not at all shy, and, when properly cooked, are\n      palatable food. In flying they sometimes sail very close to the\r\nsurface of the water, with the wings expanded, without appearing\n      to move them in the least degree, or make any exertion with them\n      whatever.\n\n      The albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the South Sea\n      birds. It is of the gull species, and takes its prey on the wing,\n      never coming on land except for the purpose of breeding. Between\n      this bird and the penguin the most singular friendship exists.\n      Their nests are constructed with great uniformity upon a plan\n      concerted between the two species—that of the albatross being\n      placed in the centre of a little square formed by the nests of","four penguins. Navigators have agreed in calling an assemblage of\n      such encampments a rookery. These rookeries have been often\n      described, but as my readers may not all have seen these\n      descriptions, and as I shall have occasion hereafter to speak of\n      the penguin and albatross, it will not be amiss to say something\n      here of their mode of building and living.\n\n      When the season for incubation arrives, the birds assemble in\n      vast numbers, and for some days appear to be deliberating upon\n      the proper course to be pursued. At length they proceed to\r\naction. A level piece of ground is selected, of suitable extent,\n      usually comprising three or four acres, and situated as near the\n      sea as possible, being still beyond its reach. The spot is chosen\n      with reference to its evenness of surface, and that is preferred\n      which is the least encumbered with stones. This matter being\n      arranged, the birds proceed, with one accord, and actuated\n      apparently by one mind, to trace out, with mathematical accuracy,\n      either a square or other parallelogram, as may best suit the\n      nature of the ground, and of just sufficient size to accommodate\r\neasily all the birds assembled, and no more—in this particular\n      seeming determined upon preventing the access of future\n      stragglers who have not participated in the labor of the\n      encampment. One side of the place thus marked out runs parallel\n      with the water’s edge, and is left open for ingress or egress.\n\n      Having defined the limits of the rookery, the colony now begin to\n      clear it of every species of rubbish, picking up stone by stone,\n      and carrying them outside of the lines, and close by them, so as\n      to form a wall on the three inland sides. Just within this wall a","perfectly level and smooth walk is formed, from six to eight feet\n      wide, and extending around the encampment—thus serving the\n      purpose of a general promenade.\n\n      The next process is to partition out the whole area into small\n      squares exactly equal in size. This is done by forming narrow\n      paths, very smooth, and crossing each other at right angles\n      throughout the entire extent of the rookery. At each intersection\n      of these paths the nest of an albatross is constructed, and a\n      penguin’s nest in the centre of each square—thus every penguin is\n      surrounded by four albatrosses, and each albatross by a like\r\nnumber of penguins. The penguin’s nest consists of a hole in the\n      earth, very shallow, being only just of sufficient depth to keep\n      her single egg from rolling. The albatross is somewhat less\n      simple in her arrangements, erecting a hillock about a foot high\n      and two in diameter. This is made of earth, seaweed, and shells.\n      On its summit she builds her nest.\n\n      The birds take especial care never to leave their nests\n      unoccupied for an instant during the period of incubation, or,\n      indeed, until the young progeny are sufficiently strong to take\r\ncare of themselves. While the male is absent at sea in search of\n      food, the female remains on duty, and it is only upon the return\n      of her partner that she ventures abroad. The eggs are never left\n      uncovered at all—while one bird leaves the nest the other\n      nestling in by its side. This precaution is rendered necessary by\n      the thieving propensities prevalent in the rookery, the\n      inhabitants making no scruple to purloin each other’s eggs at\n      every good opportunity.\n\n      Although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and\n      albatross are the sole population, yet in most of them a variety","of oceanic birds are to be met with, enjoying all the privileges\n      of citizenship, and scattering their nests here and there,\n      wherever they can find room, never interfering, however, with the\n      stations of the larger species. The appearance of such\n      encampments, when seen from a distance, is exceedingly singular.\n      The whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with\n      the immense number of the albatross (mingled with the smaller\n      tribes) which are continually hovering over it, either going to\n      the ocean or returning home. At the same time a crowd of penguins\r\nare to be observed, some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys,\n      and some marching with the military strut so peculiar to them,\n      around the general promenade ground which encircles the rookery.\n      In short, survey it as we will, nothing can be more astonishing\n      than the spirit of reflection evinced by these feathered beings,\n      and nothing surely can be better calculated to elicit reflection\n      in every well-regulated human intellect.\n\n      On the morning after our arrival in Christmas Harbour the chief\n      mate, Mr. Patterson, took the boats, and (although it was\r\nsomewhat early in the season) went in search of seal, leaving the\n      captain and a young relation of his on a point of barren land to\n      the westward, they having some business, whose nature I could not\n      ascertain, to transact in the interior of the island. Captain Guy\n      took with him a bottle, in which was a sealed letter, and made\n      his way from the point on which he was set on shore toward one of\n      the highest peaks in the place. It is probable that his design\n      was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he\n      expected to come after him. As soon as we lost sight of him we","proceeded (Peters and myself being in the mate’s boat) on our\n      cruise around the coast, looking for seal. In this business we\n      were occupied about three weeks, examining with great care every\n      nook and corner, not only of Kerguelen’s Land, but of the several\n      small islands in the vicinity. Our labours, however, were not\n      crowned with any important success. We saw a great many fur seal,\n      but they were exceedingly shy, and with the greatest exertions,\n      we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all. Sea\n      elephants were abundant, especially on the western coast of the\r\nmainland, but of these we killed only twenty, and this with great\n      difficulty. On the smaller islands we discovered a good many of\n      the hair seal, but did not molest them. We returned to the\n      schooner on the eleventh, where we found Captain Guy and his\n      nephew, who gave a very bad account of the interior, representing\n      it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the\n      world. They had remained two nights on the island, owing to some\n      misunderstanding, on the part of the second mate, in regard to\n      the sending a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\r\nOn the twelfth we made sail from Christmas Harbour retracing our\n      way to the westward, and leaving Marion’s Island, one of Crozet’s\n      group, on the larboard. We afterward passed Prince Edward’s\n      Island, leaving it also on our left, then, steering more to the\n      northward, made, in fifteen days, the islands of Tristan\n      d’Acunha, in latitude 37 degrees 8’ S, longitude 12 degrees 8’ W.\n\n      This group, now so well known, and which consists of three\n      circular islands, was first discovered by the Portuguese, and was\n      visited afterward by the Dutch in 1643, and by the French in","1767. The three islands together form a triangle, and are distant\n      from each other about ten miles, there being fine open passages\n      between. The land in all of them is very high, especially in\n      Tristan d’Acunha, properly so called. This is the largest of the\n      group, being fifteen miles in circumference, and so elevated that\n      it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or\n      ninety miles. A part of the land toward the north rises more than\n      a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea. A tableland at this\n      height extends back nearly to the centre of the island, and from\r\nthis tableland arises a lofty cone like that of Teneriffe. The\n      lower half of this cone is clothed with trees of good size, but\n      the upper region is barren rock, usually hidden among the clouds,\n      and covered with snow during the greater part of the year. There\n      are no shoals or other dangers about the island, the shores being\n      remarkably bold and the water deep. On the northwestern coast is\n      a bay, with a beach of black sand where a landing with boats can\n      be easily effected, provided there be a southerly wind. Plenty of\n      excellent water may here be readily procured; also cod and other\r\nfish may be taken with hook and line.\n\n      The next island in point of size, and the most westwardly of the\n      group, is that called the Inaccessible. Its precise situation is\n      37 degrees 17’ S. latitude, longitude 12 degrees 24’ W. It is\n      seven or eight miles in circumference, and on all sides presents\n      a forbidding and precipitous aspect. Its top is perfectly flat,\n      and the whole region is sterile, nothing growing upon it except a\n      few stunted shrubs.\n\n      Nightingale Island, the smallest and most southerly, is in\n      latitude 37 degrees 26’ S., longitude 12 degrees 12’ W. Off its","southern extremity is a high ledge of rocky islets; a few also of\n      a similar appearance are seen to the northeast. The ground is\n      irregular and sterile, and a deep valley partially separates it.\n\n      The shores of these islands abound, in the proper season, with\n      sea lions, sea elephants, the hair and fur seal, together with a\n      great variety of oceanic birds. Whales are also plenty in their\n      vicinity. Owing to the ease with which these various animals were\n      here formerly taken, the group has been much visited since its\n      discovery. The Dutch and French frequented it at a very early\r\nperiod. In 1790, Captain Patten, of the ship Industry, of\n      Philadelphia, made Tristan d’Acunha, where he remained seven\n      months (from August, 1790, to April, 1791) for the purpose of\n      collecting sealskins. In this time he gathered no less than five\n      thousand six hundred, and says that he would have had no\n      difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks. Upon\n      his arrival he found no quadrupeds, with the exception of a few\n      wild goats; the island now abounds with all our most valuable\n      domestic animals, which have been introduced by subsequent\r\nnavigators.\n\n      I believe it was not long after Captain Patten’s visit that\n      Captain Colquhoun, of the American brig Betsey, touched at the\n      largest of the islands for the purpose of refreshment. He planted\n      onions, potatoes, cabbages, and a great many other vegetables, an\n      abundance of all which is now to be met with.\n\n      In 1811, a Captain Haywood, in the Nereus, visited Tristan. He\n      found there three Americans, who were residing upon the island to\n      prepare sealskins and oil. One of these men was named Jonathan\n      Lambert, and he called himself the sovereign of the country. He","had cleared and cultivated about sixty acres of land, and turned\n      his attention to raising the coffee-plant and sugar-cane, with\n      which he had been furnished by the American Minister at Rio\n      Janeiro. This settlement, however, was finally abandoned, and in\n      1817 the islands were taken possession of by the British\n      Government, who sent a detachment for that purpose from the Cape\n      of Good Hope. They did not, however, retain them long; but, upon\n      the evacuation of the country as a British possession, two or\n      three English families took up their residence there\r\nindependently of the Government. On the twenty-fifth of March,\n      1824, the Berwick, Captain Jeffrey, from London to Van Diemen’s\n      Land, arrived at the place, where they found an Englishman of the\n      name of Glass, formerly a corporal in the British artillery. He\n      claimed to be supreme governor of the islands, and had under his\n      control twenty-one men and three women. He gave a very favourable\n      account of the salubrity of the climate and of the productiveness\n      of the soil. The population occupied themselves chiefly in\n      collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil, with which they traded\r\nto the Cape of Good Hope, Glass owning a small schooner. At the\n      period of our arrival the governor was still a resident, but his\n      little community had multiplied, there being fifty-six persons\n      upon Tristan, besides a smaller settlement of seven on\n      Nightingale Island. We had no difficulty in procuring almost\n      every kind of refreshment which we required—sheep, hogs,\n      bullocks, rabbits, poultry, goats, fish in great variety, and\n      vegetables were abundant. Having come to anchor close in with the\n      large island, in eighteen fathoms, we took all we wanted on board","very conveniently. Captain Guy also purchased of Glass five\n      hundred sealskins and some ivory. We remained here a week, during\n      which the prevailing winds were from the northward and westward,\n      and the weather somewhat hazy. On the fifth of November we made\n      sail to the southward and westward, with the intention of having\n      a thorough search for a group of islands called the Auroras,\n      respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has\n      existed.\n\n      These islands are said to have been discovered as early as 1762,\n      by the commander of the ship Aurora. In 1790, Captain Manuel de\r\nOyarvido, in the ship Princess, belonging to the Royal Philippine\n      Company, sailed, as he asserts, directly among them. In 1794, the\n      Spanish corvette Atrevida went with the determination of\n      ascertaining their precise situation, and, in a paper published\n      by the Royal Hydrographical Society of Madrid in the year 1809,\n      the following language is used respecting this expedition: “The\n      corvette Atrevida practised, in their immediate vicinity, from\n      the twenty-first to the twenty-seventh of January, all the\n      necessary observations, and measured by chronometers the\r\ndifference of longitude between these islands and the port of\n      Soledad in the Manillas. The islands are three, they are very\n      nearly in the same meridian; the centre one is rather low, and\n      the other two may be seen at nine leagues’ distance.” The\n      observations made on board the Atrevida give the following\n      results as the precise situation of each island. The most\n      northern is in latitude 52 degrees 37’ 24” S., longitude 47\n      degrees, 43’ 15” W.; the middle one in latitude 53 degrees 2’ 40”\n      S., longitude 47 degrees 55’ 15” W.; and the most southern in","latitude 53 degrees 15’ 22” S., longitude 47 degrees 57’ 15” W.\n\n      On the twenty-seventh of January, 1820, Captain James Weddel, of\n      the British navy, sailed from Staten Land also in search of the\n      Auroras. He reports that, having made the most diligent search\n      and passed not only immediately over the spots indicated by the\n      commander of the Atrevida, but in every direction throughout the\n      vicinity of these spots, he could discover no indication of land.\n      These conflicting statements have induced other navigators to\n      look out for the islands; and, strange to say, while some have\r\nsailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie\n      without finding them, there have been not a few who declare\n      positively that they have seen them; and even been close in with\n      their shores. It was Captain Guy’s intention to make every\n      exertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in\n      dispute. {*3}\n\n      We kept on our course, between the south and west, with variable\n      weather, until the twentieth of the month, when we found\n      ourselves on the debated ground, being in latitude 53 degrees 15’\n      S., longitude 47 degrees 58’ W.—that is to say, very nearly upon\r\nthe spot indicated as the situation of the most southern of the\n      group. Not perceiving any sign of land, we continued to the\n      westward of the parallel of fifty-three degrees south, as far as\n      the meridian of fifty degrees west. We then stood to the north as\n      far as the parallel of fifty-two degrees south, when we turned to\n      the eastward, and kept our parallel by double altitudes, morning\n      and evening, and meridian altitudes of the planets and moon.\n      Having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western coast\n      of Georgia, we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude","from which we set out. We then took diagonal courses throughout\n      the entire extent of sea circumscribed, keeping a lookout\n      constantly at the masthead, and repeating our examination with\n      the greatest care for a period of three weeks, during which the\n      weather was remarkably pleasant and fair, with no haze\n      whatsoever. Of course we were thoroughly satisfied that, whatever\n      islands might have existed in this vicinity at any former period,\n      no vestige of them remained at the present day. Since my return\n      home I find that the same ground was traced over, with equal\r\ncare, in 1822, by Captain Johnson, of the American schooner\n      Henry, and by Captain Morrell in the American schooner Wasp—in\n      both cases with the same result as in our own.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\n      It had been Captain Guy’s original intention, after satisfying\n      himself about the Auroras, to proceed through the Strait of\n      Magellan, and up along the western coast of Patagonia; but\n      information received at Tristan d’Acunha induced him to steer to\n      the southward, in the hope of falling in with some small islands\n      said to lie about the parallel of 60 degrees S., longitude 41\r\ndegrees 20’ W. In the event of his not discovering these lands,\n      he designed, should the season prove favourable, to push on\n      toward the pole. Accordingly, on the twelfth of December, we made\n      sail in that direction. On the eighteenth we found ourselves\n      about the station indicated by Glass, and cruised for three days\n      in that neighborhood without finding any traces of the islands he\n      had mentioned. On the twenty-first, the weather being unusually\n      pleasant, we again made sail to the southward, with the\n      resolution of penetrating in that course as far as possible.","Before entering upon this portion of my narrative, it may be as\n      well, for the information of those readers who have paid little\n      attention to the progress of discovery in these regions, to give\n      some brief account of the very few attempts at reaching the\n      southern pole which have hitherto been made.\n\n      That of Captain Cook was the first of which we have any distinct\n      account. In 1772 he sailed to the south in the Resolution,\n      accompanied by Lieutenant Furneaux in the Adventure. In December\n      he found himself as far as the fifty-eighth parallel of south\n      latitude, and in longitude 26 degrees 57’ E. Here he met with\r\nnarrow fields of ice, about eight or ten inches thick, and\n      running northwest and southeast. This ice was in large cakes, and\n      usually it was packed so closely that the vessel had great\n      difficulty in forcing a passage. At this period Captain Cook\n      supposed, from the vast number of birds to be seen, and from\n      other indications, that he was in the near vicinity of land. He\n      kept on to the southward, the weather being exceedingly cold,\n      until he reached the sixty-fourth parallel, in longitude 38\n      degrees 14’ E. Here he had mild weather, with gentle breezes, for\r\nfive days, the thermometer being at thirty-six. In January, 1773,\n      the vessels crossed the Antarctic circle, but did not succeed in\n      penetrating much farther; for upon reaching latitude 67 degrees\n      15’ they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of\n      ice, extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye\n      could reach. This ice was of every variety—and some large floes\n      of it, miles in extent, formed a compact mass, rising eighteen or\n      twenty feet above the water. It being late in the season, and no\n      hope entertained of rounding these obstructions, Captain Cook now","reluctantly turned to the northward.\n\n      In the November following he renewed his search in the Antarctic.\n      In latitude 59 degrees 40’ he met with a strong current setting\n      to the southward. In December, when the vessels were in latitude\n      67 degrees 31’, longitude 142 degrees 54’ W., the cold was\n      excessive, with heavy gales and fog. Here also birds were\n      abundant; the albatross, the penguin, and the peterel especially.\n      In latitude 70 degrees 23’ some large islands of ice were\n      encountered, and shortly afterward the clouds to the southward\n      were observed to be of a snowy whiteness, indicating the vicinity\r\nof field ice. In latitude 71 degrees 10’, longitude 106 degrees\n      54’ W., the navigators were stopped, as before, by an immense\n      frozen expanse, which filled the whole area of the southern\n      horizon. The northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken,\n      so firmly wedged together as to be utterly impassible, and\n      extending about a mile to the southward. Behind it the frozen\n      surface was comparatively smooth for some distance, until\n      terminated in the extreme background by gigantic ranges of ice\n      mountains, the one towering above the other. Captain Cook\r\nconcluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was\n      joined to a continent. Mr. J. N. Reynolds, whose great exertions\n      and perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot\n      a national expedition, partly for the purpose of exploring these\n      regions, thus speaks of the attempt of the Resolution. “We are\n      not surprised that Captain Cook was unable to go beyond 71\n      degrees 10’, but we are astonished that he did attain that point\n      on the meridian of 106 degrees 54’ west longitude. Palmer’s Land\n      lies south of the Shetland, latitude sixty-four degrees, and","tends to the southward and westward farther than any navigator\n      has yet penetrated. Cook was standing for this land when his\n      progress was arrested by the ice; which, we apprehend, must\n      always be the case in that point, and so early in the season as\n      the sixth of January—and we should not be surprised if a portion\n      of the icy mountains described was attached to the main body of\n      Palmer’s Land, or to some other portions of land lying farther to\n      the southward and westward.”\n\n      In 1803, Captains Kreutzenstern and Lisiausky were dispatched by\r\nAlexander of Russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the\n      globe. In endeavouring to get south, they made no farther than 59\n      degrees 58’, in longitude 70 degrees 15’ W. They here met with\n      strong currents setting eastwardly. Whales were abundant, but\n      they saw no ice. In regard to this voyage, Mr. Reynolds observes\n      that, if Kreutzenstern had arrived where he did earlier in the\n      season, he must have encountered ice—it was March when he reached\n      the latitude specified. The winds, prevailing, as they do, from\n      the southward and westward, had carried the floes, aided by\r\ncurrents, into that icy region bounded on the north by Georgia,\n      east by Sandwich Land and the South Orkneys, and west by the\n      South Shetland islands.\n\n      In 1822, Captain James Weddell, of the British navy, with two\n      very small vessels, penetrated farther to the south than any\n      previous navigator, and this, too, without encountering\n      extraordinary difficulties. He states that although he was\n      frequently hemmed in by ice before reaching the seventy-second\n      parallel, yet, upon attaining it, not a particle was to be\n      discovered, and that, upon arriving at the latitude of 74 degrees","15’, no fields, and only three islands of ice were visible. It is\n      somewhat remarkable that, although vast flocks of birds were\n      seen, and other usual indications of land, and although, south of\n      the Shetlands, unknown coasts were observed from the masthead\n      tending southwardly, Weddell discourages the idea of land\n      existing in the polar regions of the south.\n\n      On the 11th of January, 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell, of the\n      American schooner Wasp, sailed from Kerguelen’s Land with a view\n      of penetrating as far south as possible. On the first of February\r\nhe found himself in latitude 64 degrees 52’ S., longitude 118\n      degrees 27’ E. The following passage is extracted from his\n      journal of that date. “The wind soon freshened to an eleven-knot\n      breeze, and we embraced this opportunity of making to the west;\n      being however convinced that the farther we went south beyond\n      latitude sixty-four degrees, the less ice was to be apprehended,\n      we steered a little to the southward, until we crossed the\n      Antarctic circle, and were in latitude 69 degrees 15’ E. In this\n      latitude there was no field ice, and very few ice islands in\n      sight.”\r\nUnder the date of March fourteenth I find also this entry. “The\n      sea was now entirely free of field ice, and there were not more\n      than a dozen ice islands in sight. At the same time the\n      temperature of the air and water was at least thirteen degrees\n      higher (more mild) than we had ever found it between the\n      parallels of sixty and sixty-two south. We were now in latitude\n      70 degrees 14’ S., and the temperature of the air was\n      forty-seven, and that of the water forty-four. In this situation\n      I found the variation to be 14 degrees 27’ easterly, per","azimuth.... I have several times passed within the Antarctic\n      circle, on different meridians, and have uniformly found the\n      temperature, both of the air and the water, to become more and\n      more mild the farther I advanced beyond the sixty-fifth degree of\n      south latitude, and that the variation decreases in the same\n      proportion. While north of this latitude, say between sixty and\n      sixty-five south, we frequently had great difficulty in finding a\n      passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable\n      ice islands, some of which were from one to two miles in\r\ncircumference, and more than five hundred feet above the surface\n      of the water.”\n\n      Being nearly destitute of fuel and water, and without proper\n      instruments, it being also late in the season, Captain Morrell\n      was now obliged to put back, without attempting any further\n      progress to the westward, although an entirely open, sea lay\n      before him. He expresses the opinion that, had not these\n      overruling considerations obliged him to retreat, he could have\n      penetrated, if not to the pole itself, at least to the\n      eighty-fifth parallel. I have given his ideas respecting these\r\nmatters somewhat at length, that the reader may have an\n      opportunity of seeing how far they were borne out by my own\n      subsequent experience.\n\n      In 1831, Captain Briscoe, in the employ of the Messieurs Enderby,\n      whale-ship owners of London, sailed in the brig Lively for the\n      South Seas, accompanied by the cutter Tula. On the twenty-eighth\n      of February, being in latitude 66 degrees 30’ S., longitude 47\n      degrees 31’ E., he descried land, and “clearly discovered through\n      the snow the black peaks of a range of mountains running E. S.\n      E.” He remained in this neighbourhood during the whole of the","following month, but was unable to approach the coast nearer than\n      within ten leagues, owing to the boisterous state of the weather.\n      Finding it impossible to make further discovery during this\n      season, he returned northward to winter in Van Diemen’s Land.\n\n      In the beginning of 1832 he again proceeded southwardly, and on\n      the fourth of February land was seen to the southeast in latitude\n      67 degrees 15’ longitude 69 degrees 29’ W. This was soon found to\n      be an island near the headland of the country he had first\n      discovered. On the twenty-first of the month he succeeded in\r\nlanding on the latter, and took possession of it in the name of\n      William IV, calling it Adelaide’s Island, in honour of the\n      English queen. These particulars being made known to the Royal\n      Geographical Society of London, the conclusion was drawn by that\n      body “that there is a continuous tract of land extending from 47\n      degrees 30’ E. to 69 degrees 29’ W. longitude, running the\n      parallel of from sixty-six to sixty-seven degrees south\n      latitude.” In respect to this conclusion Mr. Reynolds observes:\n      “In the correctness of it we by no means concur; nor do the\n      discoveries of Briscoe warrant any such indifference. It was\r\nwithin these limits that Weddel proceeded south on a meridian to\n      the east of Georgia, Sandwich Land, and the South Orkney and\n      Shetland islands.” My own experience will be found to testify\n      most directly to the falsity of the conclusion arrived at by the\n      society.\n\n      These are the principal attempts which have been made at\n      penetrating to a high southern latitude, and it will now be seen\n      that there remained, previous to the voyage of the Jane, nearly\n      three hundred degrees of longitude in which the Antarctic circle\n      had not been crossed at all. Of course a wide field lay before us","for discovery, and it was with feelings of most intense interest\n      that I heard Captain Guy express his resolution of pushing boldly\n      to the southward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\n      We kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the\n      search for Glass’s islands, without meeting with any ice at all.\n      On the twenty-sixth, at noon, we were in latitude 63 degrees 23’\n      S., longitude 41 degrees 25’ W. We now saw several large ice\n      islands, and a floe of field ice, not, however, of any great\n      extent. The winds generally blew from the southeast, or the\r\nnortheast, but were very light. Whenever we had a westerly wind,\n      which was seldom, it was invariably attended with a rain squall.\n      Every day we had more or less snow. The thermometer, on the\n      twenty-seventh stood at thirty-five.\n\n      January 1, 1828.—This day we found ourselves completely hemmed in\n      by the ice, and our prospects looked cheerless indeed. A strong\n      gale blew, during the whole forenoon, from the northeast, and\n      drove large cakes of the drift against the rudder and counter\n      with such violence that we all trembled for the consequences.\r\nToward evening, the gale still blowing with fury, a large field\n      in front separated, and we were enabled, by carrying a press of\n      sail to force a passage through the smaller flakes into some open\n      water beyond. As we approached this space we took in sail by\n      degrees, and having at length got clear, lay-to under a single\n      reefed foresail.\n\n      January 2.—We had now tolerably pleasant weather. At noon we\n      found ourselves in latitude 69 degrees 10’ S, longitude 42\n      degrees 20’ W, having crossed the Antarctic circle. Very little\n      ice was to be seen to the southward, although large fields of it","lay behind us. This day we rigged some sounding gear, using a\n      large iron pot capable of holding twenty gallons, and a line of\n      two hundred fathoms. We found the current setting to the north,\n      about a quarter of a mile per hour. The temperature of the air\n      was now about thirty-three. Here we found the variation to be 14\n      degrees 28’ easterly, per azimuth.\n\n      January 5.—We had still held on to the southward without any very\n      great impediments. On this morning, however, being in latitude 73\n      degrees 15’ E., longitude 42 degrees 10’ W, we were again brought\n      to a stand by an immense expanse of firm ice. We saw,\r\nnevertheless, much open water to the southward, and felt no doubt\n      of being able to reach it eventually. Standing to the eastward\n      along the edge of the floe, we at length came to a passage of\n      about a mile in width, through which we warped our way by\n      sundown. The sea in which we now were was thickly covered with\n      ice islands, but had no field ice, and we pushed on boldly as\n      before. The cold did not seem to increase, although we had snow\n      very frequently, and now and then hail squalls of great violence.\n      Immense flocks of the albatross flew over the schooner this day,\r\ngoing from southeast to northwest.\n\n      January 7.—The sea still remained pretty well open, so that we\n      had no difficulty in holding on our course. To the westward we\n      saw some icebergs of incredible size, and in the afternoon passed\n      very near one whose summit could not have been less than four\n      hundred fathoms from the surface of the ocean. Its girth was\n      probably, at the base, three-quarters of a league, and several\n      streams of water were running from crevices in its sides. We\n      remained in sight of this island two days, and then only lost it\n      in a fog.","January 10.—Early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a\n      man overboard. He was an American named Peter Vredenburgh, a\n      native of New York, and was one of the most valuable hands on\n      board the schooner. In going over the bows his foot slipped, and\n      he fell between two cakes of ice, never rising again. At noon of\n      this day we were in latitude 78 degrees 30’, longitude 40 degrees\n      15’ W. The cold was now excessive, and we had hail squalls\n      continually from the northward and eastward. In this direction\n      also we saw several more immense icebergs, and the whole horizon\r\nto the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice, rising\n      in tiers, one mass above the other. Some driftwood floated by\n      during the evening, and a great quantity of birds flew over,\n      among which were nellies, peterels, albatrosses, and a large bird\n      of a brilliant blue plumage. The variation here, per azimuth, was\n      less than it had been previously to our passing the Antarctic\n      circle.\n\n      January 12.—Our passage to the south again looked doubtful, as\n      nothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one\n      apparently limitless floe, backed by absolute mountains of ragged\r\nice, one precipice of which arose frowningly above the other. We\n      stood to the westward until the fourteenth, in the hope of\n      finding an entrance.\n\n      January 14.—This morning we reached the western extremity of the\n      field which had impeded us, and, weathering it, came to an open\n      sea, without a particle of ice. Upon sounding with two hundred\n      fathoms, we here found a current setting southwardly at the rate\n      of half a mile per hour. The temperature of the air was\n      forty-seven, that of the water thirty-four. We now sailed to the\n      southward without meeting any interruption of moment until the","sixteenth, when, at noon, we were in latitude 81 degrees 21’,\n      longitude 42 degrees W. We here again sounded, and found a\n      current setting still southwardly, and at the rate of three\n      quarters of a mile per hour. The variation per azimuth had\n      diminished, and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant,\n      the thermometer being as high as fifty-one. At this period not a\n      particle of ice was to be discovered. All hands on board now felt\n      certain of attaining the pole.\n\n      January 17.—This day was full of incident. Innumerable flights of\n      birds flew over us from the southward, and several were shot from\r\nthe deck, one of them, a species of pelican, proved to be\n      excellent eating. About midday a small floe of ice was seen from\n      the masthead off the larboard bow, and upon it there appeared to\n      be some large animal. As the weather was good and nearly calm,\n      Captain Guy ordered out two of the boats to see what it was. Dirk\n      Peters and myself accompanied the mate in the larger boat. Upon\n      coming up with the floe, we perceived that it was in the\n      possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the Arctic bear,\n      but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals. Being\r\nwell armed, we made no scruple of attacking it at once. Several\n      shots were fired in quick succession, the most of which took\n      effect, apparently, in the head and body. Nothing discouraged,\n      however, the monster threw himself from the ice, and swam with\n      open jaws, to the boat in which were Peters and myself. Owing to\n      the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of\n      the adventure, no person was ready immediately with a second\n      shot, and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his\n      vast bulk across our gunwale, and seizing one of the men by the","small of his back, before any efficient means were taken to repel\n      him. In this extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of\n      Peters saved us from destruction. Leaping upon the back of the\n      huge beast, he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck,\n      reaching the spinal marrow at a blow. The brute tumbled into the\n      sea lifeless, and without a struggle, rolling over Peters as he\n      fell. The latter soon recovered himself, and a rope being thrown\n      him, he secured the carcass before entering the boat. We then\n      returned in triumph to the schooner, towing our trophy behind us.\r\nThis bear, upon admeasurement, proved to be full fifteen feet in\n      his greatest length. His wool was perfectly white, and very\n      coarse, curling tightly. The eyes were of a blood red, and larger\n      than those of the Arctic bear, the snout also more rounded,\n      rather resembling the snout of the bulldog. The meat was tender,\n      but excessively rank and fishy, although the men devoured it with\n      avidity, and declared it excellent eating.\n\n      Scarcely had we got our prize alongside, when the man at the\n      masthead gave the joyful shout of “land on the starboard bow!”\r\nAll hands were now upon the alert, and, a breeze springing up\n      very opportunely from the northward and eastward, we were soon\n      close in with the coast. It proved to be a low rocky islet, of\n      about a league in circumference, and altogether destitute of\n      vegetation, if we except a species of prickly pear. In\n      approaching it from the northward, a singular ledge of rock is\n      seen projecting into the sea, and bearing a strong resemblance to\n      corded bales of cotton. Around this ledge to the westward is a\n      small bay, at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient\n      landing.","It did not take us long to explore every portion of the island,\n      but, with one exception, we found nothing worthy of our\n      observation. In the southern extremity, we picked up near the\n      shore, half buried in a pile of loose stones, a piece of wood,\n      which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe. There had been\n      evidently some attempt at carving upon it, and Captain Guy\n      fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise, but the\n      resemblance did not strike me very forcibly. Besides this prow,\n      if such it were, we found no other token that any living creature\r\nhad ever been here before. Around the coast we discovered\n      occasional small floes of ice—but these were very few. The exact\n      situation of the islet (to which Captain Guy gave the name of\n      Bennet’s Islet, in honour of his partner in the ownership of the\n      schooner) is 82 degrees 50’ S. latitude, 42 degrees 20’ W.\n      longitude.\n\n      We had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees\n      farther than any previous navigators, and the sea still lay\n      perfectly open before us. We found, too, that the variation\n      uniformly decreased as we proceeded, and, what was still more\r\nsurprising, that the temperature of the air, and latterly of the\n      water, became milder. The weather might even be called pleasant,\n      and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some\n      northern point of the compass. The sky was usually clear, with\n      now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern\n      horizon—this, however, was invariably of brief duration. Two\n      difficulties alone presented themselves to our view; we were\n      getting short of fuel, and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among\n      several of the crew. These considerations began to impress upon","Captain Guy the necessity of returning, and he spoke of it\n      frequently. For my own part, confident as I was of soon arriving\n      at land of some description upon the course we were pursuing, and\n      having every reason to believe, from present appearances, that we\n      should not find it the sterile soil met with in the higher Arctic\n      latitudes, I warmly pressed upon him the expediency of\n      persevering, at least for a few days longer, in the direction we\n      were now holding. So tempting an opportunity of solving the great\n      problem in regard to an Antarctic continent had never yet been\r\nafforded to man, and I confess that I felt myself bursting with\n      indignation at the timid and ill-timed suggestions of our\n      commander. I believe, indeed, that what I could not refrain from\n      saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to push\n      on. While, therefore, I cannot but lament the most unfortunate\n      and bloody events which immediately arose from my advice, I must\n      still be allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having\n      been instrumental, however remotely, in opening to the eye of\n      science one of the most intensely exciting secrets which has ever\r\nengrossed its attention.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\n      January 18.—This morning {*4} we continued to the southward, with\n      the same pleasant weather as before. The sea was entirely smooth,\n      the air tolerably warm and from the northeast, the temperature of\n      the water fifty-three. We now again got our sounding-gear in\n      order, and, with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line, found the\n      current setting toward the pole at the rate of a mile an hour.\n      This constant tendency to the southward, both in the wind and\n      current, caused some degree of speculation, and even of alarm, in","different quarters of the schooner, and I saw distinctly that no\n      little impression had been made upon the mind of Captain Guy. He\n      was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule, however, and I finally\n      succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions. The variation\n      was now very trivial. In the course of the day we saw several\n      large whales of the right species, and innumerable flights of the\n      albatross passed over the vessel. We also picked up a bush, full\n      of red berries, like those of the hawthorn, and the carcass of a\n      singular-looking land-animal. It was three feet in length, and\r\nbut six inches in height, with four very short legs, the feet\n      armed with long claws of a brilliant scarlet, and resembling\n      coral in substance. The body was covered with a straight silky\n      hair, perfectly white. The tail was peaked like that of a rat,\n      and about a foot and a half long. The head resembled a cat’s,\n      with the exception of the ears—these were flopped like the ears\n      of a dog. The teeth were of the same brilliant scarlet as the\n      claws.\n\n      January 19.—To-day, being in latitude 83 degrees 20’, longitude\n      43 degrees 5’ W. (the sea being of an extraordinarily dark\r\ncolour), we again saw land from the masthead, and, upon a closer\n      scrutiny, found it to be one of a group of very large islands.\n      The shore was precipitous, and the interior seemed to be well\n      wooded, a circumstance which occasioned us great joy. In about\n      four hours from our first discovering the land we came to anchor\n      in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from the coast, as a high\n      surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered a nearer\n      approach of doubtful expediency. The two largest boats were now\n      ordered out, and a party, well armed (among whom were Peters and","myself), proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which\n      appeared to encircle the island. After searching about for some\n      time, we discovered an inlet, which we were entering, when we saw\n      four large canoes put off from the shore, filled with men who\n      seemed to be well armed. We waited for them to come up, and, as\n      they moved with great rapidity, they were soon within hail.\n      Captain Guy now held up a white handkerchief on the blade of an\n      oar, when the strangers made a full stop, and commenced a loud\n      jabbering all at once, intermingled with occasional shouts, in\r\nwhich we could distinguish the words Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama!\n      They continued this for at least half an hour, during which we\n      had a good opportunity of observing their appearance.\n\n      In the four canoes, which might have been fifty feet long and\n      five broad, there were a hundred and ten savages in all. They\n      were about the ordinary stature of Europeans, but of a more\n      muscular and brawny frame. Their complexion a jet black, with\n      thick and long woolly hair. They were clothed in skins of an\n      unknown black animal, shaggy and silky, and made to fit the body\n      with some degree of skill, the hair being inside, except where\r\nturned out about the neck, wrists, and ankles. Their arms\n      consisted principally of clubs, of a dark, and apparently very\n      heavy wood. Some spears, however, were observed among them,\n      headed with flint, and a few slings. The bottoms of the canoes\n      were full of black stones about the size of a large egg.\n\n      When they had concluded their harangue (for it was clear they\n      intended their jabbering for such), one of them who seemed to be\n      the chief stood up in the prow of his canoe, and made signs for\n      us to bring our boats alongside of him. This hint we pretended","not to understand, thinking it the wiser plan to maintain, if\n      possible, the interval between us, as their number more than\n      quadrupled our own. Finding this to be the case, the chief\n      ordered the three other canoes to hold back, while he advanced\n      toward us with his own. As soon as he came up with us he leaped\n      on board the largest of our boats, and seated himself by the side\n      of Captain Guy, pointing at the same time to the schooner, and\n      repeating the word Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! We now put back to\n      the vessel, the four canoes following at a little distance.\r\nUpon getting alongside, the chief evinced symptoms of extreme\n      surprise and delight, clapping his hands, slapping his thighs and\n      breast, and laughing obstreperously. His followers behind joined\n      in his merriment, and for some minutes the din was so excessive\n      as to be absolutely deafening. Quiet being at length restored,\n      Captain Guy ordered the boats to be hoisted up, as a necessary\n      precaution, and gave the chief (whose name we soon found to be\n      Too-wit) to understand that we could admit no more than twenty of\n      his men on deck at one time. With this arrangement he appeared\r\nperfectly satisfied, and gave some directions to the canoes, when\n      one of them approached, the rest remaining about fifty yards off.\n      Twenty of the savages now got on board, and proceeded to ramble\n      over every part of the deck, and scramble about among the\n      rigging, making themselves much at home, and examining every\n      article with great inquisitiveness.\n\n      It was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the\n      white race—from whose complexion, indeed, they appeared to\n      recoil. They believed the Jane to be a living creature, and\n      seemed to be afraid of hurting it with the points of their","spears, carefully turning them up. Our crew were much amused with\n      the conduct of Too-wit in one instance. The cook was splitting\n      some wood near the galley, and, by accident, struck his axe into\n      the deck, making a gash of considerable depth. The chief\n      immediately ran up, and pushing the cook on one side rather\n      roughly, commenced a half whine, half howl, strongly indicative\n      of sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner,\n      patting and smoothing the gash with his hand, and washing it from\n      a bucket of seawater which stood by. This was a degree of\r\nignorance for which we were not prepared, and for my part I could\n      not help thinking some of it affected.\n\n      When the visitors had satisfied, as well as they could, their\n      curiosity in regard to our upper works, they were admitted below,\n      when their amazement exceeded all bounds. Their astonishment now\n      appeared to be far too deep for words, for they roamed about in\n      silence, broken only by low ejaculations. The arms afforded them\n      much food for speculation, and they were suffered to handle and\n      examine them at leisure. I do not believe that they had the least\r\nsuspicion of their actual use, but rather took them for idols,\n      seeing the care we had of them, and the attention with which we\n      watched their movements while handling them. At the great guns\n      their wonder was redoubled. They approached them with every mark\n      of the profoundest reverence and awe, but forbore to examine them\n      minutely. There were two large mirrors in the cabin, and here was\n      the acme of their amazement. Too-wit was the first to approach\n      them, and he had got in the middle of the cabin, with his face to\n      one and his back to the other, before he fairly perceived them.","Upon raising his eyes and seeing his reflected self in the glass,\n      I thought the savage would go mad; but, upon turning short round\n      to make a retreat, and beholding himself a second time in the\n      opposite direction, I was afraid he would expire upon the spot.\n      No persuasion could prevail upon him to take another look;\n      throwing himself upon the floor, with his face buried in his\n      hands, he remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon\n      deck.\n\n      The whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner,\n      twenty at a time, Too-wit being suffered to remain during the\r\nentire period. We saw no disposition to thievery among them, nor\n      did we miss a single article after their departure. Throughout\n      the whole of their visit they evinced the most friendly manner.\n      There were, however, some points in their demeanour which we\n      found it impossible to understand; for example, we could not get\n      them to approach several very harmless objects—such as the\n      schooner’s sails, an egg, an open book, or a pan of flour. We\n      endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles\n      which might be turned to account in the way of traffic, but found\r\ngreat difficulty in being comprehended. We made out,\n      nevertheless, what greatly astonished us, that the islands\n      abounded in the large tortoise of the Gallipagos, one of which we\n      saw in the canoe of Too-wit. We saw also some biche de mer in the\n      hands of one of the savages, who was greedily devouring it in its\n      natural state. These anomalies—for they were such when considered\n      in regard to the latitude—induced Captain Guy to wish for a\n      thorough investigation of the country, in the hope of making a\n      profitable speculation in his discovery. For my own part, anxious","as I was to know something more of these islands, I was still\n      more earnestly bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward\n      without delay. We had now fine weather, but there was no telling\n      how long it would last; and being already in the eighty-fourth\n      parallel, with an open sea before us, a current setting strongly\n      to the southward, and the wind fair, I could not listen with any\n      patience to a proposition of stopping longer than was absolutely\n      necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a\n      proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions. I represented to the\r\ncaptain that we might easily make this group on our return, and\n      winter here in the event of being blocked up by the ice. He at\n      length came into my views (for in some way, hardly known to\n      myself, I had acquired much influence over him), and it was\n      finally resolved that, even in the event of our finding biche de\n      mer, we should only stay here a week to recruit, and then push on\n      to the southward while we might. Accordingly we made every\n      necessary preparation, and, under the guidance of Too-wit, got\n      the Jane through the reef in safety, coming to anchor about a\n      mile from the shore, in an excellent bay, completely landlocked,\r\non the southeastern coast of the main island, and in ten fathoms\n      of water, black sandy bottom. At the head of this bay there were\n      three fine springs (we were told) of good water, and we saw\n      abundance of wood in the vicinity. The four canoes followed us\n      in, keeping, however, at a respectful distance. Too-wit himself\n      remained on board, and, upon our dropping anchor, invited us to\n      accompany him on shore, and visit his village in the interior. To\n      this Captain Guy consented; and ten savages being left on board\n      as hostages, a party of us, twelve in all, got in readiness to","attend the chief. We took care to be well armed, yet without\n      evincing any distrust. The schooner had her guns run out, her\n      boarding-nettings up, and every other proper precaution was taken\n      to guard against surprise. Directions were left with the chief\n      mate to admit no person on board during our absence, and, in the\n      event of our not appearing in twelve hours, to send the cutter,\n      with a swivel, around the island in search of us.\n\n      At every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us\n      that we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto\r\nvisited by civilized men. We saw nothing with which we had been\n      formerly conversant. The trees resembled no growth of either the\n      torrid, the temperate, or the northern frigid zones, and were\n      altogether unlike those of the lower southern latitudes we had\n      already traversed. The very rocks were novel in their mass, their\n      color, and their stratification; and the streams themselves,\n      utterly incredible as it may appear, had so little in common with\n      those of other climates, that we were scrupulous of tasting them,\n      and, indeed, had difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that\r\ntheir qualities were purely those of nature. At a small brook\n      which crossed our path (the first we had reached) Too-wit and his\n      attendants halted to drink. On account of the singular character\n      of the water, we refused to taste it, supposing it to be\n      polluted; and it was not until some time afterward we came to\n      understand that such was the appearance of the streams throughout\n      the whole group. I am at a loss to give a distinct idea of the\n      nature of this liquid, and cannot do so without many words.\n      Although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities where common","water would do so, yet never, except when falling in a cascade,\n      had it the customary appearance of limpidity. It was,\n      nevertheless, in point of fact, as perfectly limpid as any\n      limestone water in existence, the difference being only in\n      appearance. At first sight, and especially in cases where little\n      declivity was found, it bore resemblance, as regards consistency,\n      to a thick infusion of gum arabic in common water. But this was\n      only the least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities. It was\n      not colourless, nor was it of any one uniform colour—presenting\r\nto the eye, as it flowed, every possible shade of purple; like\n      the hues of a changeable silk. This variation in shade was\n      produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment in\n      the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of\n      Too-wit. Upon collecting a basinful, and allowing it to settle\n      thoroughly, we perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made\n      up of a number of distinct veins, each of a distinct hue; that\n      these veins did not commingle; and that their cohesion was\n      perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves, and\r\nimperfect in regard to neighbouring veins. Upon passing the blade\n      of a knife athwart the veins, the water closed over it\n      immediately, as with us, and also, in withdrawing it, all traces\n      of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated. If,\n      however, the blade was passed down accurately between the two\n      veins, a perfect separation was effected, which the power of\n      cohesion did not immediately rectify. The phenomena of this water\n      formed the first definite link in that vast chain of apparent\n      miracles with which I was destined to be at length encircled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19","We were nearly three hours in reaching the village, it being more\n      than nine miles in the interior, and the path lying through a\n      rugged country. As we passed along, the party of Too-wit (the\n      whole hundred and ten savages of the canoes) was momentarily\n      strengthened by smaller detachments, of from two to six or seven,\n      which joined us, as if by accident, at different turns of the\n      road. There appeared so much of system in this that I could not\n      help feeling distrust, and I spoke to Captain Guy of my\n      apprehensions. It was now too late, however, to recede, and we\r\nconcluded that our best security lay in evincing a perfect\n      confidence in the good faith of Too-wit. We accordingly went on,\n      keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages, and not\n      permitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between. In\n      this way, passing through a precipitous ravine, we at length\n      reached what we were told was the only collection of habitations\n      upon the island. As we came in sight of them, the chief set up a\n      shout, and frequently repeated the word Klock-klock, which we\n      supposed to be the name of the village, or perhaps the generic\n      name for villages.\r\nThe dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable,\n      and, unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with\n      which mankind are acquainted, were of no uniform plan. Some of\n      them (and these we found belonged to the Wampoos or Yampoos, the\n      great men of the land) consisted of a tree cut down at about four\n      feet from the root, with a large black skin thrown over it, and\n      hanging in loose folds upon the ground. Under this the savage\n      nestled. Others were formed by means of rough limbs of trees,\n      with the withered foliage upon them, made to recline, at an angle","of forty-five degrees, against a bank of clay, heaped up, without\n      regular form, to the height of five or six feet. Others, again,\n      were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly, and covered\n      over with similar branches, these being removed when the tenant\n      was about to enter, and pulled on again when he had entered. A\n      few were built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood, the\n      upper limbs being partially cut through, so as to bend over upon\n      the lower, thus forming thicker shelter from the weather. The\n      greater number, however, consisted of small shallow caverns,\r\napparently scratched in the face of a precipitous ledge of dark\n      stone, resembling fuller’s earth, with which three sides of the\n      village were bounded. At the door of each of these primitive\n      caverns was a small rock, which the tenant carefully placed\n      before the entrance upon leaving his residence, for what purpose\n      I could not ascertain, as the stone itself was never of\n      sufficient size to close up more than a third of the opening.\n\n      This village, if it were worthy of the name, lay in a valley of\n      some depth, and could only be approached from the southward, the\r\nprecipitous ledge of which I have already spoken cutting off all\n      access in other directions. Through the middle of the valley ran\n      a brawling stream of the same magical-looking water which has\n      been described. We saw several strange animals about the\n      dwellings, all appearing to be thoroughly domesticated. The\n      largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in the\n      structure of the body and snout; the tail, however, was bushy,\n      and the legs slender as those of the antelope. Its motion was\n      exceedingly awkward and indecisive, and we never saw it attempt","to run. We noticed also several animals very similar in\n      appearance, but of a greater length of body, and covered with a\n      black wool. There were a great variety of tame fowls running\n      about, and these seemed to constitute the chief food of the\n      natives. To our astonishment we saw black albatross among these\n      birds in a state of entire domestication, going to sea\n      periodically for food, but always returning to the village as a\n      home, and using the southern shore in the vicinity as a place of\n      incubation. There they were joined by their friends the pelicans\n      as usual, but these latter never followed them to the dwellings\r\nof the savages. Among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks,\n      differing very little from the canvass-back of our own country,\n      black gannets, and a large bird not unlike the buzzard in\n      appearance, but not carnivorous. Of fish there seemed to be a\n      great abundance. We saw, during our visit, a quantity of dried\n      salmon, rock cod, blue dolphins, mackerel, blackfish, skate,\n      conger eels, elephantfish, mullets, soles, parrotfish,\n      leather-jackets, gurnards, hake, flounders, paracutas, and\n      innumerable other varieties. We noticed, too, that most of them\r\nwere similar to the fish about the group of Lord Auckland\n      Islands, in a latitude as low as fifty-one degrees south. The\n      Gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful. We saw but few wild\n      animals, and none of a large size, or of a species with which we\n      were familiar. One or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed\n      our path, but the natives paid them little attention, and we\n      concluded that they were not venomous.\n\n      As we approached the village with Too-wit and his party, a vast\n      crowd of the people rushed out to meet us, with loud shouts,\n      among which we could only distinguish the everlasting Anamoo-moo!","and Lama-Lama! We were much surprised at perceiving that, with\n      one or two exceptions, these new comers were entirely naked, and\n      skins being used only by the men of the canoes. All the weapons\n      of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the latter,\n      for there was no appearance of any among the villagers. There\n      were a great many women and children, the former not altogether\n      wanting in what might be termed personal beauty. They were\n      straight, tall, and well formed, with a grace and freedom of\n      carriage not to be found in civilized society. Their lips,\r\nhowever, like those of the men, were thick and clumsy, so that,\n      even when laughing, the teeth were never disclosed. Their hair\n      was of a finer texture than that of the males. Among these naked\n      villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed,\n      like the party of Too-wit, in dresses of black skin, and armed\n      with lances and heavy clubs. These appeared to have great\n      influence among the rest, and were always addressed by the title\n      Wampoo. These, too, were the tenants of the black skin palaces.\n      That of Too-wit was situated in the centre of the village, and\r\nwas much larger and somewhat better constructed than others of\n      its kind. The tree which formed its support was cut off at a\n      distance of twelve feet or thereabouts from the root, and there\n      were several branches left just below the cut, these serving to\n      extend the covering, and in this way prevent its flapping about\n      the trunk. The covering, too, which consisted of four very large\n      skins fastened together with wooden skewers, was secured at the\n      bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground. The floor\n      was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet.","To this hut we were conducted with great solemnity, and as many\n      of the natives crowded in after us as possible. Too-wit seated\n      himself on the leaves, and made signs that we should follow his\n      example. This we did, and presently found ourselves in a\n      situation peculiarly uncomfortable, if not indeed critical. We\n      were on the ground, twelve in number, with the savages, as many\n      as forty, sitting on their hams so closely around us that, if any\n      disturbance had arisen, we should have found it impossible to\n      make use of our arms, or indeed to have risen to our feet. The\r\npressure was not only inside the tent, but outside, where\n      probably was every individual on the whole island, the crowd\n      being prevented from trampling us to death only by the incessant\n      exertions and vociferations of Too-wit. Our chief security lay,\n      however, in the presence of Too-wit himself among us, and we\n      resolved to stick by him closely, as the best chance of\n      extricating ourselves from the dilemma, sacrificing him\n      immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design.\n\n      After some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored, when\n      the chief addressed us in a speech of great length, and very\r\nnearly resembling the one delivered in the canoes, with the\n      exception that the Anamoo-moos! were now somewhat more\n      strenuously insisted upon than the Lama-Lamas! We listened in\n      profound silence until the conclusion of this harangue, when\n      Captain Guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal\n      friendship and goodwill, concluding what he had to say by a\n      present of several strings of blue beads and a knife. At the\n      former the monarch, much to our surprise, turned up his nose with\n      some expression of contempt, but the knife gave him the most","unlimited satisfaction, and he immediately ordered dinner. This\n      was handed into the tent over the heads of the attendants, and\n      consisted of the palpitating entrails of a specialis of unknown\n      animal, probably one of the slim-legged hogs which we had\n      observed in our approach to the village. Seeing us at a loss how\n      to proceed, he began, by way of setting us an example, to devour\n      yard after yard of the enticing food, until we could positively\n      stand it no longer, and evinced such manifest symptoms of\n      rebellion of stomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of\r\nastonishment only inferior to that brought about by the\n      looking-glasses. We declined, however, partaking of the\n      delicacies before us, and endeavoured to make him understand that\n      we had no appetite whatever, having just finished a hearty\n      dejeuner.\n\n      When the monarch had made an end of his meal, we commenced a\n      series of cross-questioning in every ingenious manner we could\n      devise, with a view of discovering what were the chief\n      productions of the country, and whether any of them might be\n      turned to profit. At length he seemed to have some idea of our\r\nmeaning, and offered to accompany us to a part of coast where he\n      assured us the biche de mer (pointing to a specimen of that\n      animal) was to be found in great abundance. We were glad of this\n      early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd,\n      and signified our eagerness to proceed. We now left the tent,\n      and, accompanied by the whole population of the village, followed\n      the chief to the southeastern extremity of the island, nor far\n      from the bay where our vessel lay at anchor. We waited here for\n      about an hour, until the four canoes were brought around by some","of the savages to our station. The whole of our party then\n      getting into one of them, we were paddled along the edge of the\n      reef before mentioned, and of another still farther out, where we\n      saw a far greater quantity of biche de mer than the oldest seamen\n      among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower latitudes\n      most celebrated for this article of commerce. We stayed near\n      these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could\n      easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary, when we\n      were taken alongside the schooner, and parted with Too-wit, after\r\nobtaining from him a promise that he would bring us, in the\n      course of twenty-four hours, as many of the canvass-back ducks\n      and Gallipago tortoises as his canoes would hold. In the whole of\n      this adventure we saw nothing in the demeanour of the natives\n      calculated to create suspicion, with the single exception of the\n      systematic manner in which their party was strengthened during\n      our route from the schooner to the village.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\n      The chief was as good as his word, and we were soon plentifully\n      supplied with fresh provisions. We found the tortoises as fine as\r\nwe had ever seen, and the ducks surpassed our best species of\n      wild fowl, being exceedingly tender, juicy, and well-flavoured.\n      Besides these, the savages brought us, upon our making them\n      comprehend our wishes, a vast quantity of brown celery and scurvy\n      grass, with a canoe-load of fresh fish and some dried. The celery\n      was a treat indeed, and the scurvy grass proved of incalculable\n      benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of\n      disease. In a very short time we had not a single person on the\n      sick-list. We had also plenty of other kinds of fresh provisions,","among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish resembling\n      the mussel in shape, but with the taste of an oyster. Shrimps,\n      too, and prawns were abundant, and albatross and other birds’\n      eggs with dark shells. We took in, too, a plentiful stock of the\n      flesh of the hog which I have mentioned before. Most of the men\n      found it a palatable food, but I thought it fishy and otherwise\n      disagreeable. In return for these good things we presented the\n      natives with blue beads, brass trinkets, nails, knives, and\n      pieces of red cloth, they being fully delighted in the exchange.\r\nWe established a regular market on shore, just under the guns of\n      the schooner, where our barterings were carried on with every\n      appearance of good faith, and a degree of order which their\n      conduct at the village of _Klock-klock_ had not led us to expect\n      from the savages.\n\n      Matters went on thus very amicably for several days, during which\n      parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner, and\n      parties of our men frequently on shore, making long excursions\n      into the interior, and receiving no molestation whatever. Finding\n      the ease with which the vessel might be loaded with _biche de\r\nmer_, owing to the friendly disposition of the islanders, and the\n      readiness with which they would render us assistance in\n      collecting it, Captain Guy resolved to enter into negotiations\n      with Too-wit for the erection of suitable houses in which to cure\n      the article, and for the services of himself and tribe in\n      gathering as much as possible, while he himself took advantage of\n      the fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward. Upon\n      mentioning this project to the chief he seemed very willing to\n      enter into an agreement. A bargain was accordingly struck,","perfectly satisfactory to both parties, by which it was arranged\n      that, after making the necessary preparations, such as laying off\n      the proper grounds, erecting a portion of the buildings, and\n      doing some other work in which the whole of our crew would be\n      required, the schooner should proceed on her route, leaving three\n      of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of the\n      project, and instruct the natives in drying the _biche de mer_.\n      In regard to terms, these were made to depend upon the exertions\n      of the savages in our absence. They were to receive a stipulated\r\nquantity of blue beads, knives, red cloth, and so forth, for\n      every certain number of piculs of the _biche de mer_ which should\n      be ready on our return.\n\n      A description of the nature of this important article of\n      commerce, and the method of preparing it, may prove of some\n      interest to my readers, and I can find no more suitable place\n      than this for introducing an account of it. The following\n      comprehensive notice of the substance is taken from a modern\n      history of a voyage to the South Seas.\n\n      “It is that _mollusca_ from the Indian Seas which is known to\r\ncommerce by the French name _bouche de mer_ (a nice morsel from\n      the sea). If I am not much mistaken, the celebrated Cuvier calls\n      it _gasteropeda pulmonifera_. It is abundantly gathered in the\n      coasts of the Pacific islands, and gathered especially for the\n      Chinese market, where it commands a great price, perhaps as much\n      as their much-talked-of edible birds’ nests, which are properly\n      made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a species of\n      swallow from the body of these molluscae. They have no shell, no\n      legs, nor any prominent part, except an _absorbing_ and an","_excretory_, opposite organs; but, by their elastic wings, like\n      caterpillars or worms, they creep in shallow waters, in which,\n      when low, they can be seen by a kind of swallow, the sharp bill\n      of which, inserted in the soft animal, draws a gummy and\n      filamentous substance, which, by drying, can be wrought into the\n      solid walls of their nest. Hence the name of _gasteropeda\n      pulmonifera_.\n\n      “This mollusca is oblong, and of different sizes, from three to\n      eighteen inches in length; and I have seen a few that were not\n      less than two feet long. They were nearly round, a little\r\nflattish on one side, which lies next to the bottom of the sea;\n      and they are from one to eight inches thick. They crawl up into\n      shallow water at particular seasons of the year, probably for the\n      purpose of gendering, as we often find them in pairs. It is when\n      the sun has the most power on the water, rendering it tepid, that\n      they approach the shore; and they often go up into places so\n      shallow that, on the tide’s receding, they are left dry, exposed\n      to the beat of the sun. But they do not bring forth their young\n      in shallow water, as we never see any of their progeny, and\r\nfull-grown ones are always observed coming in from deep water.\n      They feed principally on that class of zoophytes which produce\n      the coral.\n\n      “The _biche de mer_ is generally taken in three or four feet of\n      water; after which they are brought on shore, and split at one\n      end with a knife, the incision being one inch or more, according\n      to the size of the mollusca. Through this opening the entrails\n      are forced out by pressure, and they are much like those of any\n      other small tenant of the deep. The article is then washed, and\n      afterward boiled to a certain degree, which must not be too much","or too little. They are then buried in the ground for four hours,\n      then boiled again for a short time, after which they are dried,\n      either by the fire or the sun. Those cured by the sun are worth\n      the most; but where one picul (133 1/3 lbs.) can be cured that\n      way, I can cure thirty piculs by the fire. When once properly\n      cured, they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years\n      without any risk; but they should be examined once in every few\n      months, say four times a year, to see if any dampness is likely\n      to affect them.\n\n      “The Chinese, as before stated, consider _biche de mer_ a very\r\ngreat luxury, believing that it wonderfully strengthens and\n      nourishes the system, and renews the exhausted system of the\n      immoderate voluptuary. The first quality commands a high price in\n      Canton, being worth ninety dollars a picul; the second quality,\n      seventy-five dollars; the third, fifty dollars; the fourth,\n      thirty dollars; the fifth, twenty dollars; the sixth, twelve\n      dollars; the seventh, eight dollars; and the eighth, four\n      dollars; small cargoes, however, will often bring more in\n      Manilla, Singapore, and Batavia.”\r\nAn agreement having been thus entered into, we proceeded\n      immediately to land everything necessary for preparing the\n      buildings and clearing the ground. A large flat space near the\n      eastern shore of the bay was selected, where there was plenty of\n      both wood and water, and within a convenient distance of the\n      principal reefs on which the _biche de mer_ was to be procured.\n      We now all set to work in good earnest, and soon, to the great\n      astonishment of the savages, had felled a sufficient number of\n      trees for our purpose, getting them quickly in order for the\n      framework of the houses, which in two or three days were so far","under way that we could safely trust the rest of the work to the\n      three men whom we intended to leave behind. These were John\n      Carson, Alfred Harris, and ___ Peterson (all natives of London, I\n      believe), who volunteered their services in this respect.\n\n      By the last of the month we had everything in readiness for\n      departure. We had agreed, however, to pay a formal visit of\n      leave-taking to the village, and Too-wit insisted so\n      pertinaciously upon our keeping the promise that we did not think\n      it advisable to run the risk of offending him by a final refusal.\r\nI believe that not one of us had at this time the slightest\n      suspicion of the good faith of the savages. They had uniformly\n      behaved with the greatest decorum, aiding us with alacrity in our\n      work, offering us their commodities, frequently without price,\n      and never, in any instance, pilfering a single article, although\n      the high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident\n      by the extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon\n      our making them a present. The women especially were most\n      obliging in every respect, and, upon the whole, we should have\r\nbeen the most suspicious of human beings had we entertained a\n      single thought of perfidy on the part of a people who treated us\n      so well. A very short while sufficed to prove that this apparent\n      kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply laid plan\n      for our destruction, and that the islanders for whom we\n      entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem, were among the\n      most barbarous, subtle, and bloodthirsty wretches that ever\n      contaminated the face of the globe.\n\n      It was on the first of February that we went on shore for the","purpose of visiting the village. Although, as said before, we\n      entertained not the slightest suspicion, still no proper\n      precaution was neglected. Six men were left in the schooner, with\n      instructions to permit none of the savages to approach the vessel\n      during our absence, under any pretence whatever, and to remain\n      constantly on deck. The boarding-nettings were up, the guns\n      double-shotted with grape and canister, and the swivels loaded\n      with canisters of musket-balls. She lay, with her anchor apeak,\n      about a mile from the shore, and no canoe could approach her in\r\nany direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the\n      full fire of our swivels immediately.\n\n      The six men being left on board, our shore-party consisted of\n      thirty-two persons in all. We were armed to the teeth, having\n      with us muskets, pistols, and cutlasses; besides, each had a long\n      kind of seaman’s knife, somewhat resembling the bowie knife now\n      so much used throughout our western and southern country. A\n      hundred of the black skin warriors met us at the landing for the\n      purpose of accompanying us on our way. We noticed, however, with\r\nsome surprise, that they were now entirely without arms; and,\n      upon questioning Too-wit in relation to this circumstance, he\n      merely answered that _Mattee non we pa pa si_—meaning that there\n      was no need of arms where all were brothers. We took this in good\n      part, and proceeded.\n\n      We had passed the spring and rivulet of which I before spoke, and\n      were now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain\n      of soapstone hills among which the village was situated. This\n      gorge was very rocky and uneven, so much so that it was with no\n      little difficulty we scrambled through it on our first visit to","Klock-klock. The whole length of the ravine might have been a\n      mile and a half, or probably two miles. It wound in every\n      possible direction through the hills (having apparently formed,\n      at some remote period, the bed of a torrent), in no instance\n      proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn. The\n      sides of this dell would have averaged, I am sure, seventy or\n      eighty feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of\n      their extent, and in some portions they arose to an astonishing\n      height, overshadowing the pass so completely that but little of\r\nthe light of day could penetrate. The general width was about\n      forty feet, and occasionally it diminished so as not to allow the\n      passage of more than five or six persons abreast. In short, there\n      could be no place in the world better adapted for the\n      consummation of an ambuscade, and it was no more than natural\n      that we should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon it.\n      When I now think of our egregious folly, the chief subject of\n      astonishment seems to be, that we should have ever ventured,\n      under any circumstances, so completely into the power of unknown\n      savages as to permit them to march both before and behind us in\r\nour progress through this ravine. Yet such was the order we\n      blindly took up, trusting foolishly to the force of our party,\n      the unarmed condition of Too-wit and his men, the certain\n      efficacy of our firearms (whose effect was yet a secret to the\n      natives), and, more than all, to the long-sustained pretension of\n      friendship kept up by these infamous wretches. Five or six of\n      them went on before, as if to lead the way, ostentatiously\n      busying themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from\n      the path. Next came our own party. We walked closely together,","taking care only to prevent separation. Behind followed the main\n      body of the savages, observing unusual order and decorum.\n\n      Dirk Peters, a man named Wilson Allen, and myself were on the\n      right of our companions, examining, as we went along, the\n      singular stratification of the precipice which overhung us. A\n      fissure in the soft rock attracted our attention. It was about\n      wide enough for one person to enter without squeezing, and\n      extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet in a\n      straight course, sloping afterward to the left. The height of the\r\nopening, is far as we could see into it from the main gorge, was\n      perhaps sixty or seventy feet. There were one or two stunted\n      shrubs growing from the crevices, bearing a species of filbert\n      which I felt some curiosity to examine, and pushed in briskly for\n      that purpose, gathering five or six of the nuts at a grasp, and\n      then hastily retreating. As I turned, I found that Peters and\n      Allen had followed me. I desired them to go back, as there was\n      not room for two persons to pass, saying they should have some of\n      my nuts. They accordingly turned, and were scrambling back, Allen\r\nbeing close to the mouth of the fissure, when I was suddenly\n      aware of a concussion resembling nothing I had ever before\n      experienced, and which impressed me with a vague conception, if\n      indeed I then thought of anything, that the whole foundations of\n      the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder, and that the day of\n      universal dissolution was at hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\n\n      As soon as I could collect my scattered senses, I found myself\n      nearly suffocated, and grovelling in utter darkness among a\n      quantity of loose earth, which was also falling upon me heavily\n      in every direction, threatening to bury me entirely. Horribly","alarmed at this idea, I struggled to gain my feet, and at last\n      succeeded. I then remained motionless for some moments,\n      endeavouring to conceive what had happened to me, and where I\n      was. Presently I heard a deep groan just at my ear, and afterward\n      the smothered voice of Peters calling to me for aid in the name\n      of God. I scrambled one or two paces forward, when I fell\n      directly over the head and shoulders of my companion, who, I soon\n      discovered, was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his\n      middle, and struggling desperately to free himself from the\r\npressure. I tore the dirt from around him with all the energy I\n      could command, and at length succeeded in getting him out.\n\n      As soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise\n      to be capable of conversing rationally, we both came to the\n      conclusion that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured\n      had, by some convulsion of nature, or probably from their own\n      weight, caved in overhead, and that we were consequently lost for\n      ever, being thus entombed alive. For a long time we gave up\n      supinely to the most intense agony and despair, such as cannot be\r\nadequately imagined by those who have never been in a similar\n      position. I firmly believed that no incident ever occurring in\n      the course of human events is more adapted to inspire the\n      supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case like our\n      own, of living inhumation. The blackness of darkness which\n      envelops the victim, the terrific oppression of lungs, the\n      stifling fumes from the damp earth, unite with the ghastly\n      considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of hope,\n      and that such is the allotted portion of the dead, to carry into","the human heart a degree of appalling awe and horror not to be\n      tolerated—never to be conceived.\n\n      At length Peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain\n      precisely the extent of our calamity, and grope about our prison;\n      it being barely possible, he observed, that some opening might\n      yet be left us for escape. I caught eagerly at this hope, and,\n      arousing myself to exertion, attempted to force my way through\n      the loose earth. Hardly had I advanced a single step before a\n      glimmer of light became perceptible, enough to convince me that,\r\nat all events, we should not immediately perish for want of air.\n      We now took some degree of heart, and encouraged each other to\n      hope for the best. Having scrambled over a bank of rubbish which\n      impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light, we\n      found less difficulty in advancing and also experienced some\n      relief from the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented\n      us. Presently we were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects\n      around, and discovered that we were near the extremity of the\n      straight portion of the fissure, where it made a turn to the\r\nleft. A few struggles more, and we reached the bend, when to our\n      inexpressible joy, there appeared a long seam or crack extending\n      upward a vast distance, generally at an angle of about forty-five\n      degrees, although sometimes much more precipitous. We could not\n      see through the whole extent of this opening; but, as a good deal\n      of light came down it, we had little doubt of finding at the top\n      of it (if we could by any means reach the top) a clear passage\n      into the open air.\n\n      I now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure\n      from the main gorge, and that our companion, Allen, was still","missing; we determined at once to retrace our steps and look for\n      him. After a long search, and much danger from the farther caving\n      in of the earth above us, Peters at length cried out to me that\n      he had hold of our companion’s foot, and that his whole body was\n      deeply buried beneath the rubbish beyond the possibility of\n      extricating him. I soon found that what he said was too true, and\n      that, of course, life had been long extinct. With sorrowful\n      hearts, therefore, we left the corpse to its fate, and again made\n      our way to the bend.\r\nThe breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us, and,\n      after one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up, we began once\n      more to despair. I have before said that the chain of hills\n      through which ran the main gorge was composed of a species of\n      soft rock resembling soapstone. The sides of the cleft we were\n      now attempting to ascend were of the same material, and so\n      excessively slippery, being wet, that we could get but little\n      foothold upon them even in their least precipitous parts; in some\n      places, where the ascent was nearly perpendicular, the difficulty\r\nwas, of course, much aggravated; and, indeed, for some time we\n      thought insurmountable. We took courage, however, from despair,\n      and what, by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our\n      bowie knives, and swinging at the risk of our lives, to small\n      projecting points of a harder species of slaty rock which now and\n      then protruded from the general mass, we at length reached a\n      natural platform, from which was perceptible a patch of blue sky,\n      at the extremity of a thickly-wooded ravine. Looking back now,\n      with somewhat more leisure, at the passage through which we had","thus far proceeded, we clearly saw from the appearance of its\n      sides, that it was of late formation, and we concluded that the\n      concussion, whatever it was, which had so unexpectedly\n      overwhelmed us, had also, at the same moment, laid open this path\n      for escape. Being quite exhausted with exertion, and indeed, so\n      weak that we were scarcely able to stand or articulate, Peters\n      now proposed that we should endeavour to bring our companions to\n      the rescue by firing the pistols which still remained in our\n      girdles—the muskets as well as cutlasses had been lost among the\r\nloose earth at the bottom of the chasm. Subsequent events proved\n      that, had we fired, we should have sorely repented it, but\n      luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by this time arisen in\n      my mind, and we forbore to let the savages know of our\n      whereabouts.\n\n      After having reposed for about an hour, we pushed on slowly up\n      the ravine, and had gone no great way before we heard a\n      succession of tremendous yells. At length we reached what might\n      be called the surface of the ground; for our path hitherto, since\n      leaving the platform, had lain beneath an archway of high rock\r\nand foliage, at a vast distance overhead. With great caution we\n      stole to a narrow opening, through which we had a clear sight of\n      the surrounding country, when the whole dreadful secret of the\n      concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view.\n\n      The spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the\n      highest peak in the range of the soapstone hills. The gorge in\n      which our party of thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet\n      to the left of us. But, for at least one hundred yards, the\n      channel or bed of this gorge was entirely filled up with the","chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and stone that\n      had been artificially tumbled within it. The means by which the\n      vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than\n      evident, for sure traces of the murderous work were yet\n      remaining. In several spots along the top of the eastern side of\n      the gorge (we were now on the western) might be seen stakes of\n      wood driven into the earth. In these spots the earth had not\n      given way, but throughout the whole extent of the face of the\n      precipice from which the mass had fallen, it was clear, from\r\nmarks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the\n      rock blaster, that stakes similar to those we saw standing had\n      been inserted, at not more than a yard apart, for the length of\n      perhaps three hundred feet, and ranging at about ten feet back\n      from the edge of the gulf. Strong cords of grape vine were\n      attached to the stakes still remaining on the hill, and it was\n      evident that such cords had also been attached to each of the\n      other stakes. I have already spoken of the singular\n      stratification of these soapstone hills; and the description just\n      given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected\r\nour escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of\n      its nature. This was such that almost every natural convulsion\n      would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular layers or\n      ridges running parallel with one another, and a very moderate\n      exertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same\n      purpose. Of this stratification the savages had availed\n      themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends. There can be no\n      doubt that, by the continuous line of stakes, a partial rupture\n      of the soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one","or two feet, when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each\n      of the cords (these cords being attached to the tops of the\n      stakes, and extending back from the edge of the cliff), a vast\n      leverage power was obtained, capable of hurling the whole face of\n      the hill, upon a given signal, into the bosom of the abyss below.\n      The fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of\n      uncertainty. We alone had escaped from the tempest of that\n      overwhelming destruction. We were the only living white men upon\n      the island.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\n\n      Our situation, as it now appeared, was scarcely less dreadful\r\nthan when we had conceived ourselves entombed forever. We saw\n      before us no prospect but that of being put to death by the\n      savages, or of dragging out a miserable existence in captivity\n      among them. We might, to be sure, conceal ourselves for a time\n      from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills, and, as\n      a final resort, in the chasm from which we had just issued; but\n      we must either perish in the long polar winter through cold and\n      famine, or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain\n      relief.\n\n      The whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages,\r\ncrowds of whom, we now perceived, had come over from the islands\n      to the southward on flat rafts, doubtless with a view of lending\n      their aid in the capture and plunder of the Jane. The vessel\n      still lay calmly at anchor in the bay, those on board being\n      apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting them. How we\n      longed at that moment to be with them! either to aid in effecting\n      their escape, or to perish with them in attempting a defence. We\n      saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without\n      bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads, with but a","remote hope of benefit to them. A pistol fired might suffice to\n      apprise them that something wrong had occurred; but the report\n      could not possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety\n      lay in getting out of the harbour forthwith—it could not tell\n      them that no principles of honour now bound them to remain, that\n      their companions were no longer among the living. Upon hearing\n      the discharge they could not be more thoroughly prepared to meet\n      the foe, who were now getting ready to attack, than they already\n      were, and always had been. No good, therefore, and infinite harm,\r\nwould result from our firing, and after mature deliberation, we\n      forbore.\n\n      Our next thought was to attempt to rush toward the vessel, to\n      seize one of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay,\n      and endeavour to force a passage on board. But the utter\n      impossibility of succeeding in this desperate task soon became\n      evident. The country, as I said before, was literally swarming\n      with the natives, skulking among the bushes and recesses of the\n      hills, so as not to be observed from the schooner. In our\n      immediate vicinity especially, and blockading the sole path by\r\nwhich we could hope to attain the shore at the proper point were\n      stationed the whole party of the black skin warriors, with\n      Too-wit at their head, and apparently only waiting for some\n      re-enforcement to commence his onset upon the Jane. The canoes,\n      too, which lay at the head of the bay, were manned with savages,\n      unarmed, it is true, but who undoubtedly had arms within reach.\n      We were forced, therefore, however unwillingly, to remain in our\n      place of concealment, mere spectators of the conflict which\n      presently ensued.\n\n      In about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts, or","flatboats, without riggers, filled with savages, and coming round\n      the southern bight of the harbor. They appeared to have no arms\n      except short clubs, and stones which lay in the bottom of the\n      rafts. Immediately afterward another detachment, still larger,\n      appeared in an opposite direction, and with similar weapons. The\n      four canoes, too, were now quickly filled with natives, starting\n      up from the bushes at the head of the bay, and put off swiftly to\n      join the other parties. Thus, in less time than I have taken to\n      tell it, and as if by magic, the Jane saw herself surrounded by\r\nan immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing\n      her at all hazards.\n\n      That they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an\n      instant. The six men left in the vessel, however resolutely they\n      might engage in her defence, were altogether unequal to the\n      proper management of the guns, or in any manner to sustain a\n      contest at such odds. I could hardly imagine that they would make\n      resistance at all, but in this was deceived; for presently I saw\n      them get springs upon the cable, and bring the vessel’s starboard\r\nbroadside to bear upon the canoes, which by this time were within\n      pistol range, the rafts being nearly a quarter of a mile to\n      windward. Owing to some cause unknown, but most probably to the\n      agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless\n      a situation, the discharge was an entire failure. Not a canoe was\n      hit or a single savage injured, the shots striking short and\n      ricocheting over their heads. The only effect produced upon them\n      was astonishment at the unexpected report and smoke, which was so\n      excessive that for some moments I almost thought they would","abandon their design entirely, and return to the shore. And this\n      they would most likely have done had our men followed up their\n      broadside by a discharge of small arms, in which, as the canoes\n      were now so near at hand, they could not have failed in doing\n      some execution, sufficient, at least, to deter this party from a\n      farther advance, until they could have given the rafts also a\n      broadside. But, in place of this, they left the canoe party to\n      recover from their panic, and, by looking about them, to see that\n      no injury had been sustained, while they flew to the larboard to\r\nget ready for the rafts.\n\n      The discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect. The\n      star and double-headed shot of the large guns cut seven or eight\n      of the rafts completely asunder, and killed, perhaps, thirty or\n      forty of the savages outright, while a hundred of them, at least,\n      were thrown into the water, the most of them dreadfully wounded.\n      The remainder, frightened out of their senses, commenced at once\n      a precipitate retreat, not even waiting to pick up their maimed\n      companions, who were swimming about in every direction, screaming\r\nand yelling for aid. This great success, however, came too late\n      for the salvation of our devoted people. The canoe party were\n      already on board the schooner to the number of more than a\n      hundred and fifty, the most of them having succeeded in\n      scrambling up the chains and over the boarding-netting even\n      before the matches had been applied to the larboard guns. Nothing\n      now could withstand their brute rage. Our men were borne down at\n      once, overwhelmed, trodden under foot, and absolutely torn to\n      pieces in an instant.\n\n      Seeing this, the savages on the rafts got the better of their","fears, and came up in shoals to the plunder. In five minutes the\n      Jane was a pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage.\n      The decks were split open and ripped up; the cordage, sails, and\n      everything movable on deck demolished as if by magic, while, by\n      dint of pushing at the stern, towing with the canoes, and hauling\n      at the sides, as they swam in thousands around the vessel, the\n      wretches finally forced her on shore (the cable having been\n      slipped), and delivered her over to the good offices of Too-wit,\n      who, during the whole of the engagement, had maintained, like a\r\nskilful general, his post of security and reconnaissance among\n      the hills, but, now that the victory was completed to his\n      satisfaction, condescended to scamper down with his warriors of\n      the black skin, and become a partaker in the spoils.\n\n      Too-wit’s descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding place and\n      reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm. At about fifty\n      yards from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water, at\n      which we slaked the burning thirst that now consumed us. Not far\n      from the spring we discovered several of the filbert-bushes which\r\nI mentioned before. Upon tasting the nuts we found them\n      palatable, and very nearly resembling in flavour the common\n      English filbert. We collected our hats full immediately,\n      deposited them within the ravine, and returned for more. While we\n      were busily employed in gathering these, a rustling in the bushes\n      alarmed us, and we were upon the point of stealing back to our\n      covert, when a large black bird of the bittern species\n      strugglingly and slowly arose above the shrubs. I was so much\n      startled that I could do nothing, but Peters had sufficient\n      presence of mind to run up to it before it could make its escape,","and seize it by the neck. Its struggles and screams were\n      tremendous, and we had thoughts of letting it go, lest the noise\n      should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in\n      the neighbourhood. A stab with a bowie knife, however, at length\n      brought it to the ground, and we dragged it into the ravine,\n      congratulating ourselves that, at all events, we had thus\n      obtained a supply of food enough to last us for a week.\n\n      We now went out again to look about us, and ventured a\n      considerable distance down the southern declivity of the hill,\r\nbut met with nothing else which could serve us for food. We\n      therefore collected a quantity of dry wood and returned, seeing\n      one or two large parties of the natives on their way to the\n      village, laden with the plunder of the vessel, and who, we were\n      apprehensive, might discover us in passing beneath the hill.\n\n      Our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as\n      possible, and with this object, we arranged some brushwood over\n      the aperture which I have before spoken of as the one through\n      which we saw the patch of blue sky, on reaching the platform from\r\nthe interior of the chasm. We left only a very small opening just\n      wide enough to admit of our seeing the bay, without the risk of\n      being discovered from below. Having done this, we congratulated\n      ourselves upon the security of the position; for we were now\n      completely excluded from observation, as long as we chose to\n      remain within the ravine itself, and not venture out upon the\n      hill, We could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been\n      within this hollow; but, indeed, when we came to reflect upon the\n      probability that the fissure through which we attained it had","been only just now created by the fall of the cliff opposite, and\n      that no other way of attaining it could be perceived, we were not\n      so much rejoiced at the thought of being secure from molestation\n      as fearful lest there should be absolutely no means left us for\n      descent. We resolved to explore the summit of the hill\n      thoroughly, when a good opportunity should offer. In the meantime\n      we watched the motions of the savages through our loophole.\n\n      They had already made a complete wreck of the vessel, and were\n      now preparing to set her on fire. In a little while we saw the\r\nsmoke ascending in huge volumes from her main hatchway, and,\n      shortly afterward, a dense mass of flame burst up from the\n      forecastle. The rigging, masts and what remained of the sails\n      caught immediately, and the fire spread rapidly along the decks.\n      Still a great many of the savages retained their stations about\n      her, hammering with large stones, axes, and cannon balls at the\n      bolts and other iron and copper work. On the beach, and in canoes\n      and rafts, there were not less, altogether, in the immediate\n      vicinity of the schooner, than ten thousand natives, besides the\r\nshoals of them who, laden with booty, were making their way\n      inland and over to the neighbouring islands. We now anticipated a\n      catastrophe, and were not disappointed. First of all there came a\n      smart shock (which we felt as distinctly where we were as if we\n      had been slightly galvanized), but unattended with any visible\n      signs of an explosion. The savages were evidently startled, and\n      paused for an instant from their labours and yellings. They were\n      upon the point of recommencing, when suddenly a mass of smoke\n      puffed up from the decks, resembling a black and heavy","thundercloud—then, as if from its bowels, arose a tall stream of\n      vivid fire to the height, apparently, of a quarter of a mile—then\n      there came a sudden circular expansion of the flame—then the\n      whole atmosphere was magically crowded, in a single instant, with\n      a wild chaos of wood, and metal, and human limbs—and, lastly,\n      came the concussion in its fullest fury, which hurled us\n      impetuously from our feet, while the hills echoed and re-echoed\n      the tumult, and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the\n      ruins tumbled headlong in every direction around us.\r\nThe havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation,\n      and they had now, indeed, reaped the full and perfect fruits of\n      their treachery. Perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion,\n      while at least an equal number were desperately mangled. The\n      whole surface of the bay was literally strewn with the struggling\n      and drowning wretches, and on shore matters were even worse. They\n      seemed utterly appalled by the suddenness and completeness of\n      their discomfiture, and made no efforts at assisting one another.\n      At length we observed a total change in their demeanour. From\r\nabsolute stupor, they appeared to be, all at once, aroused to the\n      highest pitch of excitement, and rushed wildly about, going to\n      and from a certain point on the beach, with the strangest\n      expressions of mingled horror, rage, and intense curiosity\n      depicted on their countenances, and shouting, at the top of their\n      voices, “Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”\n\n      Presently we saw a large body go off into the hills, whence they\n      returned in a short time, carrying stakes of wood. These they\n      brought to the station where the crowd was the thickest, which\n      now separated so as to afford us a view of the object of all this","excitement. We perceived something white lying upon the ground,\n      but could not immediately make out what it was. At length we saw\n      that it was the carcass of the strange animal with the scarlet\n      teeth and claws which the schooner had picked up at sea on the\n      eighteenth of January. Captain Guy had had the body preserved for\n      the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to England. I\n      remember he had given some directions about it just before our\n      making the island, and it had been brought into the cabin and\n      stowed away in one of the lockers. It had now been thrown on\r\nshore by the explosion; but why it had occasioned so much concern\n      among the savages was more than we could comprehend. Although\n      they crowded around the carcass at a little distance, none of\n      them seemed willing to approach it closely. By-and-by the men\n      with the stakes drove them in a circle around it, and no sooner\n      was this arrangement completed, than the whole of the vast\n      assemblage rushed into the interior of the island, with loud\n      screams of “Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\n\n      During the six or seven days immediately following we remained in\r\nour hiding-place upon the hill, going out only occasionally, and\n      then with the greatest precaution, for water and filberts. We had\n      made a kind of penthouse on the platform, furnishing it with a\n      bed of dry leaves, and placing in it three large flat stones,\n      which served us for both fireplace and table. We kindled a fire\n      without difficulty by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together,\n      the one soft, the other hard. The bird we had taken in such good\n      season proved excellent eating, although somewhat tough. It was\n      not an oceanic fowl, but a species of bittern, with jet black and","grizzly plumage, and diminutive wings in proportion to its bulk.\n      We afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the\n      ravine, apparently seeking for the one we had captured; but, as\n      they never alighted, we had no opportunity of catching them.\n\n      As long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our\n      situation, but it was now entirely consumed, and it became\n      absolutely necessary that we should look out for provision. The\n      filberts would not satisfy the cravings of hunger, afflicting us,\n      too, with severe gripings of the bowels, and, if freely indulged\r\nin, with violent headache. We had seen several large tortoises\n      near the seashore to the eastward of the hill, and perceived they\n      might be easily taken, if we could get at them without the\n      observation of the natives. It was resolved, therefore, to make\n      an attempt at descending.\n\n      We commenced by going down the southern declivity, which seemed\n      to offer the fewest difficulties, but had not proceeded a hundred\n      yards before (as we had anticipated from appearances on the\n      hilltop) our progress was entirely arrested by a branch of the\n      gorge in which our companions had perished. We now passed along\r\nthe edge of this for about a quarter of a mile, when we were\n      again stopped by a precipice of immense depth, and, not being\n      able to make our way along the brink of it, we were forced to\n      retrace our steps by the main ravine.\n\n      We now pushed over to the eastward, but with precisely similar\n      fortune. After an hour’s scramble, at the risk of breaking our\n      necks, we discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit\n      of black granite, with fine dust at the bottom, and whence the\n      only egress was by the rugged path in which we had come down.","Toiling again up this path, we now tried the northern edge of the\n      hill. Here we were obliged to use the greatest possible caution\n      in our maneuvers, as the least indiscretion would expose us to\n      the full view of the savages in the village. We crawled along,\n      therefore, on our hands and knees, and, occasionally, were even\n      forced to throw ourselves at full length, dragging our bodies\n      along by means of the shrubbery. In this careful manner we had\n      proceeded but a little way, when we arrived at a chasm far deeper\n      than any we had yet seen, and leading directly into the main\r\ngorge. Thus our fears were fully confirmed, and we found\n      ourselves cut off entirely from access to the world below.\n      Thoroughly exhausted by our exertions, we made the best of our\n      way back to the platform, and throwing ourselves upon the bed of\n      leaves, slept sweetly and soundly for some hours.\n\n      For several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in\n      exploring every part of the summit of the hill, in order to\n      inform ourselves of its actual resources. We found that it would\n      afford us no food, with the exception of the unwholesome\n      filberts, and a rank species of scurvy grass, which grew in a\r\nlittle patch of not more than four rods square, and would be soon\n      exhausted. On the fifteenth of February, as near as I can\n      remember, there was not a blade of this left, and the nuts were\n      growing scarce; our situation, therefore, could hardly be more\n      lamentable. {*5} On the sixteenth we again went round the walls\n      of our prison, in hope of finding some avenue of escape; but to\n      no purpose. We also descended the chasm in which we had been\n      overwhelmed, with the faint expectation of discovering, through\n      this channel, some opening to the main ravine. Here, too, we were","disappointed, although we found and brought up with us a musket.\n\n      On the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining\n      more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made\n      our way in the first search. We remembered that one of the\n      fissures in the sides of this pit had been but partially looked\n      into, and we were anxious to explore it, although with no\n      expectation of discovering here any opening.\n\n      We found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow\n      as before, and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some\r\nattention. It was, indeed, one of the most singular-looking\n      places imaginable, and we could scarcely bring ourselves to\n      believe it altogether the work of nature. The pit, from its\n      eastern to its western extremity, was about five hundred yards in\n      length, when all its windings were threaded; the distance from\n      east to west in a straight line not being more (I should suppose,\n      having no means of accurate examination) than forty or fifty\n      yards. Upon first descending into the chasm, that is to say, for\n      a hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill, the sides of\r\nthe abyss bore little resemblance to each other, and, apparently,\n      had at no time been connected, the one surface being of the\n      soapstone, and the other of marl, granulated with some metallic\n      matter. The average breadth or interval between the two cliffs\n      was probably here sixty feet, but there seemed to be no\n      regularity of formation. Passing down, however, beyond the limit\n      spoken of, the interval rapidly contracted, and the sides began\n      to run parallel, although, for some distance farther, they were\n      still dissimilar in their material and form of surface. Upon","arriving within fifty feet of the bottom, a perfect regularity\n      commenced. The sides were now entirely uniform in substance, in\n      colour, and in lateral direction, the material being a very black\n      and shining granite, and the distance between the two sides, at\n      all points facing each other, exactly twenty yards. The precise\n      formation of the chasm will be best understood by means of a\n      delineation taken upon the spot; for I had luckily with me a\n      pocketbook and pencil, which I preserved with great care through\n      a long series of subsequent adventure, and to which I am indebted\r\nfor memoranda of many subjects which would otherwise have been\n      crowded from my remembrance.\n\n      This figure [No figures in text] gives the general outlines of\n      the chasm, without the minor cavities in the sides, of which\n      there were several, each cavity having a corresponding\n      protuberance opposite. The bottom of the gulf was covered to the\n      depth of three or four inches with a powder almost impalpable,\n      beneath which we found a continuation of the black granite. To\n      the right, at the lower extremity, will be noticed the appearance\n      of a small opening; this is the fissure alluded to above, and to\r\nexamine which more minutely than before was the object of our\n      second visit. We now pushed into it with vigor, cutting away a\n      quantity of brambles which impeded us, and removing a vast heap\n      of sharp flints somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape. We were\n      encouraged to persevere, however, by perceiving some little light\n      proceeding from the farther end. We at length squeezed our way\n      for about thirty feet, and found that the aperture was a low and\n      regularly formed arch, having a bottom of the same impalpable\n      powder as that in the main chasm. A strong light now broke upon","us, and, turning a short bend, we found ourselves in another\n      lofty chamber, similar to the one we had left in every respect\n      but longitudinal form. Its general figure is here given.\n\n      The total length of this chasm, commencing at the opening _a_ and\n      proceeding round the curve _b_ to the extremity _d_, is five\n      hundred and fifty yards. At _c_ we discovered a small aperture\n      similar to the one through which we had issued from the other\n      chasm, and this was choked up in the same manner with brambles\n      and a quantity of the white arrowhead flints. We forced our way\r\nthrough it, finding it about forty feet long, and emerged into a\n      third chasm. This, too, was precisely like the first, except in\n      its longitudinal shape, which was thus.\n\n      We found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and\n      twenty yards. At the point _a_ was an opening about six feet\n      wide, and extending fifteen feet into the rock, where it\n      terminated in a bed of marl, there being no other chasm beyond,\n      as we had expected. We were about leaving this fissure, into\n      which very little light was admitted, when Peters called my\n      attention to a range of singular-looking indentures in the\r\nsurface of the marl forming the termination of the _cul-de-sac_.\n      With a very slight exertion of the imagination, the left, or most\n      northern of these indentures might have been taken for the\n      intentional, although rude, representation of a human figure\n      standing erect, with outstretched arm. The rest of them bore also\n      some little resemblance to alphabetical characters, and Peters\n      was willing, at all events, to adopt the idle opinion that they\n      were really such. I convinced him of his error, finally, by\n      directing his attention to the floor of the fissure, where, among","the powder, we picked up, piece by piece, several large flakes of\n      the marl, which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion\n      from the surface where the indentures were found, and which had\n      projecting points exactly fitting the indentures; thus proving\n      them to have been the work of nature.\n\n      After satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded\n      us no means of escape from our prison, we made our way back,\n      dejected and dispirited, to the summit of the hill. Nothing worth\n      mentioning occurred during the next twenty-four hours, except\r\nthat, in examining the ground to the eastward of the third chasm,\n      we found two triangular holes of great depth, and also with black\n      granite sides. Into these holes we did not think it worth while\n      to attempt descending, as they had the appearance of mere natural\n      wells, without outlet. They were each about twenty yards in\n      circumference, and their shape, as well as relative position in\n      regard to the third chasm, is shown in figure 5. {image}\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\n\n      On the twentieth of the month, finding it altogether impossible\n      to subsist any longer upon the filberts, the use of which\r\noccasioned us the most excruciating torment, we resolved to make\n      a desperate attempt at descending the southern declivity of the\n      hill. The face of the precipice was here of the softest species\n      of soapstone, although nearly perpendicular throughout its whole\n      extent (a depth of a hundred and fifty feet at the least), and in\n      many places even overarching. After a long search we discovered a\n      narrow ledge about twenty feet below the brink of the gulf; upon\n      this Peters contrived to leap, with what assistance I could\n      render him by means of our pocket-handkerchiefs tied together.","With somewhat more difficulty I also got down; and we then saw\n      the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in\n      which we had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried\n      by the fall of the hill—that is, by cutting steps in the face of\n      the soapstone with our knives. The extreme hazard of the attempt\n      can scarcely be conceived; but, as there was no other resource,\n      we determined to undertake it.\n\n      Upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbert-bushes; and\n      to one of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs.\r\nThe other end being tied round Peters’ waist, I lowered him down\n      over the edge of the precipice until the handkerchiefs were\n      stretched tight. He now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the\n      soapstone (as far in as eight or ten inches), sloping away the\n      rock above to the height of a foot, or thereabout, so as to allow\n      of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a tolerably strong peg\n      into the levelled surface. I then drew him up for about four\n      feet, when he made a hole similar to the one below, driving in a\n      peg as before, and having thus a resting-place for both feet and\r\nhands. I now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush, throwing\n      him the end, which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole,\n      letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower\n      than he had yet been that is, to the full extent of the\n      handkerchiefs. Here he dug another hole, and drove another peg.\n      He then drew himself up, so as to rest his feet in the hole just\n      cut, taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above. It\n      was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost\n      peg, with the view of fastening them to the second; and here he","found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so\n      great a distance apart. However, after one or two unsuccessful\n      and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot (having to hold on\n      with his left hand while he labored to undo the fastening with\n      his right), he at length cut the string, leaving six inches of it\n      affixed to the peg. Tying the handkerchiefs now to the second\n      peg, he descended to a station below the third, taking care not\n      to go too far down. By these means (means which I should never\n      have conceived of myself, and for which we were indebted\n      altogether to Peters’ ingenuity and resolution) my companion\r\nfinally succeeded, with the occasional aid of projections in the\n      cliff, in reaching the bottom without accident.\n\n      It was some time before I could summon sufficient resolution to\n      follow him; but I did at length attempt it. Peters had taken off\n      his shirt before descending, and this, with my own, formed the\n      rope necessary for the adventure. After throwing down the musket\n      found in the chasm, I fastened this rope to the bushes, and let\n      myself down rapidly, striving, by the vigor of my movements, to\n      banish the trepidation which I could overcome in no other manner.\r\nThis answered sufficiently well for the first four or five steps;\n      but presently I found my imagination growing terribly excited by\n      thoughts of the vast depths yet to be descended, and the\n      precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my\n      only support. It was in vain I endeavored to banish these\n      reflections, and to keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat\n      surface of the cliff before me. The more earnestly I struggled\n      _not to think,_the more intensely vivid became my conceptions,\n      and the more horribly distinct. At length arrived that crisis of","fancy, so fearful in all similar cases, the crisis in which we\n      began to anticipate the feelings with which we _shall_fall—to\n      picture to ourselves the sickness, and dizziness, and the last\n      struggle, and the half swoon, and the final bitterness of the\n      rushing and headlong descent. And now I found these fancies\n      creating their own realities, and all imagined horrors crowding\n      upon me in fact. I felt my knees strike violently together, while\n      my fingers were gradually but certainly relaxing their grasp.\n      There was a ringing in my ears, and I said, “This is my knell of\r\ndeath!” And now I was consumed with the irrepressible desire of\n      looking below. I could not, I would not, confine my glances to\n      the cliff; and, with a wild, indefinable emotion, half of horror,\n      half of a relieved oppression, I threw my vision far down into\n      the abyss. For one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon\n      their hold, while, with the movement, the faintest possible idea\n      of ultimate escape wandered, like a shadow, through my mind—in\n      the next my whole soul was pervaded with a longing to fall; a\n      desire, a yearning, a passion utterly uncontrollable. I let go at\r\nonce my grasp upon the peg, and, turning half round from the\n      precipice, remained tottering for an instant against its naked\n      face. But now there came a spinning of the brain; a\n      shrill-sounding and phantom voice screamed within my ears; a\n      dusky, fiendish, and filmy figure stood immediately beneath me;\n      and, sighing, I sunk down with a bursting heart, and plunged\n      within its arms.\n\n      I had swooned, and Peters had caught me as I fell. He had\n      observed my proceedings from his station at the bottom of the\n      cliff; and perceiving my imminent danger, had endeavored to","inspire me with courage by every suggestion he could devise;\n      although my confusion of mind had been so great as to prevent my\n      hearing what he said, or being conscious that he had even spoken\n      to me at all. At length, seeing me totter, he hastened to ascend\n      to my rescue, and arrived just in time for my preservation. Had I\n      fallen with my full weight, the rope of linen would inevitably\n      have snapped, and I should have been precipitated into the abyss;\n      as it was, he contrived to let me down gently, so as to remain\n      suspended without danger until animation returned. This was in\r\nabout fifteen minutes. On recovery, my trepidation had entirely\n      vanished; I felt a new being, and, with some little further aid\n      from my companion, reached the bottom also in safety.\n\n      We now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved\n      the tomb of our friends, and to the southward of the spot where\n      the hill had fallen. The place was one of singular wildness, and\n      its aspect brought to my mind the descriptions given by\n      travellers of those dreary regions marking the site of degraded\n      Babylon. Not to speak of the ruins of the disrupted cliff, which\r\nformed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the northward, the\n      surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn with\n      huge tumuli, apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of\n      art; although, in detail, no semblance of art could be detected.\n      Scoria were abundant, and large shapeless blocks of the black\n      granite, intermingled with others of marl, {*6} and both\n      granulated with metal. Of vegetation there were no traces\n      whatsoever throughout the whole of the desolate area within\n      sight. Several immense scorpions were seen, and various reptiles","not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes. As food was our\n      most immediate object, we resolved to make our way to the\n      seacoast, distant not more than half a mile, with a view of\n      catching turtle, several of which we had observed from our place\n      of concealment on the hill. We had proceeded some hundred yards,\n      threading our route cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli,\n      when, upon turning a corner, five savages sprung upon us from a\n      small cavern, felling Peters to the ground with a blow from a\n      club. As he fell the whole party rushed upon him to secure their\r\nvictim, leaving me time to recover from my astonishment. I still\n      had the musket, but the barrel had received so much injury in\n      being thrown from the precipice that I cast it aside as useless,\n      preferring to trust my pistols, which had been carefully\n      preserved in order. With these I advanced upon the assailants,\n      firing one after the other in quick succession. Two savages fell,\n      and one, who was in the act of thrusting a spear into Peters,\n      sprung to his feet without accomplishing his purpose. My\n      companion being thus released, we had no further difficulty. He\n      had his pistols also, but prudently declined using them,\r\nconfiding in his great personal strength, which far exceeded that\n      of any person I have ever known. Seizing a club from one of the\n      savages who had fallen, he dashed out the brains of the three who\n      remained, killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the\n      weapon, and leaving us completely masters of the field.\n\n      So rapidly had these events passed, that we could scarcely\n      believe in their reality, and were standing over the bodies of\n      the dead in a species of stupid contemplation, when we were\n      brought to recollection by the sound of shouts in the distance.","It was clear that the savages had been alarmed by the firing, and\n      that we had little chance of avoiding discovery. To regain the\n      cliff, it would be necessary to proceed in the direction of the\n      shouts, and even should we succeed in arriving at its base, we\n      should never be able to ascend it without being seen. Our\n      situation was one of the greatest peril, and we were hesitating\n      in which path to commence a flight, when one of the savages\n      _whom_I had shot, and supposed dead, sprang briskly to his feet,\n      and attempted to make his escape. We overtook _him,_however,\r\nbefore he had advanced many paces, and were about to put him to\n      death, when Peters suggested that we might derive some benefit\n      from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt to escape. We\n      therefore dragged him with us, making him understand that we\n      would shoot him if he offered resistance. In a few minutes he was\n      perfectly submissive, and ran by our sides as we pushed in among\n      the rocks, making for the seashore.\n\n      So far, the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing\n      hid the sea, except at intervals, from our sight, and, when we\r\nfirst had it fairly in view, it was perhaps two hundred yards\n      distant. As we emerged into the open beach we saw, to our great\n      dismay, an immense crowd of the natives pouring from the village,\n      and from all visible quarters of the island, making toward us\n      with gesticulations of extreme fury, and howling like wild\n      beasts. We were upon the point of turning upon our steps, and\n      trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the rougher\n      ground, when I discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from\n      behind a large rock which ran out into the water. Toward these we","now ran with all speed, and, reaching them, found them unguarded,\n      and without any other freight than three of the large Gallipago\n      turtles and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers. We\n      instantly took possession of one of them, and, forcing our\n      captive on board, pushed out to sea with all the strength we\n      could command.\n\n      We had not made, however, more than fifty yards from the shore\n      before we became sufficiently calm to perceive the great\n      oversight of which we had been guilty in leaving the other canoe\n      in the power of the savages, who, by this time, were not more\r\nthan twice as far from the beach as ourselves, and were rapidly\n      advancing to the pursuit. No time was now to be lost. Our hope\n      was, at best, a forlorn one, but we had none other. It was very\n      doubtful whether, with the utmost exertion, we could get back in\n      time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe; but\n      yet there was a chance that we could. We might save ourselves if\n      we succeeded, while not to make the attempt was to resign\n      ourselves to inevitable butchery.\n\n      The canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike, and, in\n      place of turning it around, we merely changed our position in\r\npaddling. As soon as the savages perceived this they redoubled\n      their yells, as well as their speed, and approached with\n      inconceivable rapidity. We pulled, however, with all the energy\n      of desperation, and arrived at the contested point before more\n      than one of the natives had attained it. This man paid dearly for\n      his superior agility, Peters shooting him through the head with a\n      pistol as he approached the shore. The foremost among the rest of\n      his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces distant as we\n      seized upon the canoe. We at first endeavored to pull her into","the deep water, beyond the reach of the savages, but, finding her\n      too firmly aground, and there being no time to spare, Peters,\n      with one or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket,\n      succeeded in dashing out a large portion of the bow and of one\n      side. We then pushed off. Two of the natives by this time had got\n      hold of our boat, obstinately refusing to let go, until we were\n      forced to despatch them with our knives. We were now clear off,\n      and making great way out to sea. The main body of the savages,\n      upon reaching the broken canoe, set up the most tremendous yell\r\nof rage and disappointment conceivable. In truth, from everything\n      I could see of these wretches, they appeared to be the most\n      wicked, hypocritical, vindictive, bloodthirsty, and altogether\n      fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe. It is clear we\n      should have had no mercy had we fallen into their hands. They\n      made a mad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe, but,\n      finding it useless, again vented their rage in a series of\n      hideous vociferations, and rushed up into the hills.\n\n      We were thus relieved from immediate danger, but our situation\r\nwas still sufficiently gloomy. We knew that four canoes of the\n      kind we had were at one time in the possession of the savages,\n      and were not aware of the fact (afterward ascertained from our\n      captive) that two of these had been blown to pieces in the\n      explosion of the _Jane Guy._We calculated, therefore, upon being\n      yet pursued, as soon as our enemies could get round to the bay\n      (distant about three miles) where the boats were usually laid up.\n      Fearing this, we made every exertion to leave the island behind\n      us, and went rapidly through the water, forcing the prisoner to","take a paddle. In about half an hour, when we had gained probably\n      five or six miles to the southward, a large fleet of the\n      flat-bottomed canoes or rafts were seen to emerge from the bay\n      evidently with the design of pursuit. Presently they put back,\n      despairing to overtake us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25\n\n\n      We now found ourselves in the wide and desolate Antarctic Ocean,\n      in a latitude exceeding eighty-four degrees, in a frail canoe,\n      and with no provision but the three turtles. The long polar\n      winter, too, could not be considered as far distant, and it\n      became necessary that we should deliberate well upon the course\r\nto be pursued. There were six or seven islands in sight belonging\n      to the same group, and distant from each other about five or six\n      leagues; but upon neither of these had we any intention to\n      venture. In coming from the northward in the _Jane Guy_ we had\n      been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of\n      ice—this, however little it maybe in accordance with the\n      generally received notions respecting the Antarctic, was a\n      fact—experience would not permit us to deny. To attempt,\n      therefore, getting back would be folly—especially at so late a\r\nperiod of the season. Only one course seemed to be left open for\n      hope. We resolved to steer boldly to the southward, where there\n      was at least a probability of discovering other lands, and more\n      than a probability of finding a still milder climate.\n\n      So far we had found the Antarctic, like the Arctic Ocean,\n      peculiarly free from violent storms or immoderately rough water;\n      but our canoe was, at best, of frail structure, although large,\n      and we set busily to work with a view of rendering her as safe as\n      the limited means in our possession would admit. The body of the","boat was of no better material than bark—the bark of a tree\n      unknown. The ribs were of a tough osier, well adapted to the\n      purpose for which it was used. We had fifty feet room from stem\n      to stern, from four to six in breadth, and in depth throughout\n      four feet and a half-the boats thus differing vastly in shape\n      from those of any other inhabitants of the Southern Ocean with\n      whom civilized nations are acquainted. We never did believe them\n      the workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them; and\n      some days after this period discovered, by questioning our\r\ncaptive, that they were in fact made by the natives of a group to\n      the southwest of the country where we found them, having fallen\n      accidentally into the hands of our barbarians. What we could do\n      for the security of our boat was very little indeed. Several wide\n      rents were discovered near both ends, and these we contrived to\n      patch up with pieces of woollen jacket. With the help of the\n      superfluous paddles, of which there were a great many, we erected\n      a kind of framework about the bow, so as to break the force of\n      any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter. We also\r\nset up two paddle-blades for masts, placing them opposite each\n      other, one by each gunwale, thus saving the necessity of a yard.\n      To these masts we attached a sail made of our shirts-doing this\n      with some difficulty, as here we could get no assistance from our\n      prisoner whatever, although he had been willing enough to labor\n      in all the other operations. The sight of the linen seemed to\n      affect him in a very singular manner. He could not be prevailed\n      upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to\n      force him, and shrieking out, _“Tekeli-li!”_\n\n      Having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of","the canoe, we now set sail to the south-southeast for the\n      present, with the view of weathering the most southerly of the\n      group in sight. This being done, we turned the bow full to the\n      southward. The weather could by no means be considered\n      disagreeable. We had a prevailing and very gentle wind from the\n      northward, a smooth sea, and continual daylight. No ice whatever\n      was to be seen; _nor did I ever see one particle of this after\n      leaving the parallel of Bennet’s Islet._Indeed, the temperature\n      of the water was here far too warm for its existence in any\r\nquantity. Having killed the largest of our tortoises, and\n      obtained from him not only food but a copious supply of water, we\n      continued on our course, without any incident of moment, for\n      perhaps seven or eight days, during which period we must have\n      proceeded a vast distance to the southward, as the wind blew\n      constantly with us, and a very strong current set continually in\n      the direction we were pursuing.\n\n      _March 1st_. {*7}-Many unusual phenomena now—indicated that we\n      were entering upon a region of novelty and wonder. A high range\n      of light gray vapor appeared constantly in the southern horizon,\r\nflaring up occasionally in lofty streaks, now darting from east\n      to west, now from west to east, and again presenting a level and\n      uniform summit—in short, having all the wild variations of the\n      Aurora Borealis. The average height of this vapor, as apparent\n      from our station, was about twenty-five degrees. The temperature\n      of the sea seemed to be increasing momentarily, and there was a\n      very perceptible alteration in its color.\n\n      _March 2d._-To-day by repeated questioning of our captive, we\n      came to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island","of the massacre, its inhabitants, and customs—but with these how\n      can I now detain the reader? I may say, however, that we learned\n      there were eight islands in the group—that they were governed by\n      a common king, named _Tsalemon_or _Psalemoun,_who resided in one\n      of the smallest of the islands; that the black skins forming the\n      dress of the warriors came from an animal of huge size to be\n      found only in a valley near the court of the king—that the\n      inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats than the\n      flat-bottomed rafts; the four canoes being all of the kind in\r\ntheir possession, and, these having been obtained, by mere\n      accident, from some large island in the southwest—that his own\n      name was Nu-Nu—that he had no knowledge of Bennet’s Islet—and\n      that the appellation of the island he had left was Tsalal. The\n      commencement of the words _Tsalemon_and Tsalal was given with a\n      prolonged hissing sound, which we found it impossible to imitate,\n      even after repeated endeavors, and which was precisely the same\n      with the note of the black bittern we had eaten up on the summit\n      of the hill.\n\n      _March 3d._-The heat of the water was now truly remarkable, and\r\nin color was undergoing a rapid change, being no longer\n      transparent, but of a milky consistency and hue. In our immediate\n      vicinity it was usually smooth, never so rough as to endanger the\n      canoe—but we were frequently surprised at perceiving, to our\n      right and left, at different distances, sudden and extensive\n      agitations of the surface; these, we at length noticed, were\n      always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapor to the\n      southward.\n\n      _March 4th._-To-day, with the view of widening our sail, the\n      breeze from the northward dying away perceptibly, I took from my","coat-pocket a white handkerchief. Nu-Nu was seated at my elbow,\n      and the linen accidentally flaring in his face, he became\n      violently affected with convulsions. These were succeeded by\n      drowsiness and stupor, and low murmurings of _“‘Tekeli-li!\n      Tekeli-li!”_\n\n      _March_5th.-The wind had entirely ceased, but it was evident that\n      we were still hurrying on to the southward, under the influence\n      of a powerful current. And now,—indeed, it would seem reasonable\n      that we should experience some alarm at the turn events were\n      taking—but we felt none. The countenance of Peters indicated\r\nnothing of this nature, although it wore at times an expression I\n      could not fathom. The polar winter appeared to be coming on—but\n      coming without its terrors. I felt a numbness of body and mind—a\n      dreaminess of sensation but this was all.\n\n      _March 6th._-The gray vapor had now arisen many more degrees\n      above the horizon, and was gradually losing its grayness of tint.\n      The heat of the water was extreme, even unpleasant to the touch,\n      and its milky hue was more evident than ever. Today a violent\n      agitation of the water occurred very close to the canoe. It was\r\nattended, as usual, with a wild flaring up of the vapor at its\n      summit, and a momentary division at its base. A fine white\n      powder, resembling ashes—but certainly not such—fell over the\n      canoe and over a large surface of the water, as the flickering\n      died away among the vapor and the commotion subsided in the sea.\n      Nu-Nu now threw himself on his face in the bottom of the boat,\n      and no persuasions could induce him to arise.\n\n      _March 7th._-This day we questioned Nu-Nu concerning the motives\n      of his countrymen in destroying our companions; but he appeared","to be too utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational\n      reply. He still obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat; and,\n      upon reiterating the questions as to the motive, made use only of\n      idiotic gesticulations, such as raising with his forefinger the\n      upper lip, and displaying the teeth which lay beneath it. These\n      were black. We had never before seen the teeth of an inhabitant\n      of Tsalal.\n\n      _March 8th._-To-day there floated by us one of the white animals\n      whose appearance upon the beach at Tsalal had occasioned so wild\n      a commotion among the savages. I would have picked it up, but\r\nthere came over me a sudden listlessness, and I forbore. The heat\n      of the water still increased, and the hand could no longer be\n      endured within it. Peters spoke little, and I knew not what to\n      think of his apathy. Nu-Nu breathed, and no more.\n\n      _March 9th._-The whole ashy material fell now continually around\n      us, and in vast quantities. The range of vapor to the southward\n      had arisen prodigiously in the horizon, and began to assume more\n      distinctness of form. I can liken it to nothing but a limitless\n      cataract, rolling silently into the sea from some immense and\r\nfar-distant rampart in the heaven. The gigantic curtain ranged\n      along the whole extent of the southern horizon. It emitted no\n      sound.\n\n      _March 21st._-A sullen darkness now hovered above us—but from out\n      the milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose, and stole\n      up along the bulwarks of the boat. We were nearly overwhelmed by\n      the white ashy shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe,\n      but melted into the water as it fell. The summit of the cataract\n      was utterly lost in the dimness and the distance. Yet we were\n      evidently approaching it with a hideous velocity. At intervals","there were visible in it wide, yawning, but momentary rents, and\n      from out these rents, within which was a chaos of flitting and\n      indistinct images, there came rushing and mighty, but soundless\n      winds, tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course.\n\n      _March 22d._-The darkness had materially increased, relieved only\n      by the glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain\n      before us. Many gigantic and pallidly white birds flew\n      continuously now from beyond the veil, and their scream was the\n      eternal _Tekeli-li!_as they retreated from our vision. Hereupon\r\nNu-Nu stirred in the bottom of the boat; but upon touching him we\n      found his spirit departed. And now we rushed into the embraces of\n      the cataract, where a chasm threw itself open to receive us. But\n      there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure, very far\n      larger in its proportions than any dweller among men. And the hue\n      of the skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the\n      snow.\n\n      NOTE\n\n      THE circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing\n      death of Mr. Pym are already well known to the public through the\n      medium of the daily press. It is feared that the few remaining\r\nchapters which were to have completed his narrative, and which\n      were retained by him, while the above were in type, for the\n      purpose of revision, have been irrecoverably lost through the\n      accident by which he perished himself. This, however, may prove\n      not to be the case, and the papers, if ultimately found, will be\n      given to the public.\n\n      No means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency. The\n      gentleman whose name is mentioned in the preface, and who, from\n      the statement there made, might be supposed able to fill the\n      vacuum, has declined the task—this, for satisfactory reasons","connected with the general inaccuracy of the details afforded\n      him, and his disbelief in the entire truth of the latter portions\n      of the narration. Peters, from whom some information might be\n      expected, is still alive, and a resident of Illinois, but cannot\n      be met with at present. He may hereafter be found, and will, no\n      doubt, afford material for a conclusion of Mr. Pym’s account.\n\n      The loss of two or three final chapters (for there were but two\n      or three) is the more deeply to be regretted, as it can not be\n      doubted they contained matter relative to the Pole itself, or at\r\nleast to regions in its very near proximity; and as, too, the\n      statements of the author in relation to these regions may shortly\n      be verified or contradicted by means of the governmental\n      expedition now preparing for the Southern Ocean.\n\n      On one point in the narrative some remarks may well be offered;\n      and it would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if\n      what he may here observe should have a tendency to throw credit,\n      in any degree, upon the very singular pages now published. We\n      allude to the chasms found in the island of Tsalal, and to the\r\nwhole of the figures upon pages 245-47 {of the printed\n      edition—ed.}.\n\n      (Note: No figures were included with this text)\n\n      Mr. Pym has given the figures of the chasms without comment, and\n      speaks decidedly of the _indentures_found at the extremity of the\n      most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful\n      resemblance to alphabetical characters, and, in short, as being\n      positively _not such. _This assertion is made in a manner so\n      simple, and sustained by a species of demonstration so conclusive\n      (viz., the fitting of the projections of the fragments found","among the dust into the indentures upon the wall), that we are\n      forced to believe the writer in earnest; and no reasonable reader\n      should suppose otherwise. But as the facts in relation to all the\n      figures are most singular (especially when taken in connection\n      with statements made in the body of the narrative), it may be as\n      well to say a word or two concerning them all—this, too, the more\n      especially as the facts in question have, beyond doubt, escaped\n      the attention of Mr. Poe.\n\n      Figure 1, then, figure 2, figure 3, and figure 5, when conjoined\r\nwith one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves\n      presented, and when deprived of the small lateral branches or\n      arches (which, it will be remembered, served only as a means of\n      communication between the main chambers, and were of totally\n      distinct character), constitute an Ethiopian verbal root—the root\n      “To be shady,’—whence all the inflections of shadow or darkness.\n\n      In regard to the “left or most northwardly” of the indentures in\n      figure 4, it is more than probable that the opinion of Peters was\n      correct, and that the hieroglyphical appearance was really the\r\nwork of art, and intended as the representation of a human form.\n      The delineation is before the reader, and he may, or may not,\n      perceive the resemblance suggested; but the rest of the\n      indentures afford strong confirmation of Peters’ idea. The upper\n      range is evidently the Arabic verbal root “To be white,” whence\n      all the inflections of brilliancy and whiteness. The lower range\n      is not so immediately perspicuous. The characters are somewhat\n      broken and disjointed; nevertheless, it can not be doubted that,\n      in their perfect state, they formed the full Egyptian word, “The","region of the south.” It should be observed that these\n      interpretations confirm the opinion of Peters in regard to the\n      “most northwardly” of the figures. The arm is outstretched toward\n      the south.\n\n      Conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and\n      exciting conjecture. They should be regarded, perhaps, in\n      connection with some of the most faintly detailed incidents of\n      the narrative; although in no visible manner is this chain of\n      connection complete. Tekeli-li! was the cry of the affrighted\n      natives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcase of the\r\n_white_animal picked up at sea. This also was the shuddering\n      exclamatives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the\n      _white_materials in possession of Mr. Pym. This also was the\n      shriek of the swift-flying, _white, _and gigantic birds which\n      issued from the vapory _white_curtain of the South. Nothing\n      _white_was to be found at Tsalal, and nothing otherwise in the\n      subsequent voyage to the region beyond. It is not impossible that\n      “Tsalal,” the appellation of the island of the chasms, may be\n      found, upon minute philological scrutiny, to betray either some\r\nalliance with the chasms themselves, or some reference to the\n      Ethiopian characters so mysteriously written in their windings.\n\n      _“I have graven it within the hills, and my vengeance upon the\n      dust within the rock.”_\n\n\n\n\nNOTES TO THE THIRD VOLUME\n\n\n      {*1} Whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron oil-tanks—why\n      the _Grampus_ was not I have never been able to ascertain.\n\n      {*2} The case of the brig _Polly_, of Boston, is one so much in\n      point, and her fate, in many respects, so remarkably similar to\n      our own, that I cannot forbear alluding to it here. This vessel,","of one hundred and thirty tons burden, sailed from Boston, with a\n      cargo of lumber and provisions, for Santa Croix, on the twelfth\n      of December, 1811, under the command of Captain Casneau. There\n      were eight souls on board besides the captain—the mate, four\n      seamen, and the cook, together with a Mr. Hunt, and a negro girl\n      belonging to him. On the fifteenth, having cleared the shoal of\n      Georges, she sprung a leak in a gale of wind from the southeast,\n      and was finally capsized; but, the masts going by the board, she\n      afterward righted. They remained in this situation, without fire,\r\nand with very little provision, for the period of one hundred and\n      ninety-one days (from December the fifteenth to June the\n      twentieth), when Captain Casneau and Samuel Badger, the only\n      survivors, were taken off the wreck by the Fame, of Hull, Captain\n      Featherstone, bound home from Rio Janeiro. When picked up, they\n      were in latitude 28 degrees N., longitude 13 degrees W., having\n      drifted above two thousand miles! On the ninth of July the Fame\n      fell in with the brig Dromero, Captain Perkins, who landed the\n      two sufferers in Kennebeck. The narrative from which we gather\r\nthese details ends in the following words:\n\n      “It is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast\n      distance, upon the most frequented part of the Atlantic, and not\n      be discovered all this time. They were passed by more than a\n      dozen sail, one of which came so nigh them that they could\n      distinctly see the people on deck and on the rigging looking at\n      them; but, to the inexpressible disappointment of the starving\n      and freezing men, they stifled the dictates of compassion,\n      hoisted sail, and cruelly abandoned them to their fate.”\n\n      {*3} Among the vessels which at various times have professed to","meet with the Auroras may be mentioned the ship San Miguel, in\n      1769; the ship Aurora, in 1774; the brig Pearl, in 1779; and the\n      ship Dolores, in 1790. They all agree in giving the mean latitude\n      fifty-three degrees south.\n\n      {*4} The terms morning and evening, which I have made use of to\n      avoid confusion in my narrative, as far as possible, must not, of\n      course, be taken in their ordinary sense. For a long time past we\n      had had no night at all, the daylight being continual. The dates\n      throughout are according to nautical time, and the bearing must\r\nbe understood as per compass. I would also remark, in this place,\n      that I cannot, in the first portion of what is here written,\n      pretend to strict accuracy in respect to dates, or latitudes and\n      longitudes, having kept no regular journal until after the period\n      of which this first portion treats. In many instances I have\n      relied altogether upon memory.\n\n      {*5} This day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the\n      south several huge wreaths of the grayish vapour I have spoken\n      of.\n\n      {*6} The marl was also black; indeed, we noticed no light colored\n      substances of any kind upon the island.\r\n{*7}For obvious reasons I cannot pretend to strict accuracy in\n      these dates. They are given principally with a view to perspicity\n      of narrative, and as set down in my pencil memorandum.\n\n\n\n\nLIGEIA\n\n\n      And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the\n      mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God is but a great\n      will pervading all things by nature of its intentness. Man doth\n      not yield himself to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save\n      only through the weakness of his feeble will.—_Joseph Glanvill_.\n\n      I cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely","where, I first became acquainted with the lady Ligeia. Long years\n      have since elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much\n      suffering. Or, perhaps, I cannot now bring these points to mind,\n      because, in truth, the character of my beloved, her rare\n      learning, her singular yet placid cast of beauty, and the\n      thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language,\n      made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily\n      progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown. Yet I\n      believe that I met her first and most frequently in some large,\r\nold, decaying city near the Rhine. Of her family—I have surely\n      heard her speak. That it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be\n      doubted. Ligeia! Ligeia! Buried in studies of a nature more than\n      all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world, it\n      is by that sweet word alone—by Ligeia—that I bring before mine\n      eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more. And now, while I\n      write, a recollection flashes upon me that I have never known the\n      paternal name of her who was my friend and my betrothed, and who\n      became the partner of my studies, and finally the wife of my\r\nbosom. Was it a playful charge on the part of my Ligeia? or was\n      it a test of my strength of affection, that I should institute no\n      inquiries upon this point? or was it rather a caprice of my own—a\n      wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate\n      devotion? I but indistinctly recall the fact itself—what wonder\n      that I have utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated\n      or attended it? And, indeed, if ever that spirit which is\n      entitled _Romance_—if ever she, the wan and the misty-winged\n      _Ashtophet_ of idolatrous Egypt, presided, as they tell, over","marriages ill-omened, then most surely she presided over mine.\n\n      There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me\n      not. It is the person of Ligeia. In stature she was tall,\n      somewhat slender, and, in her latter days, even emaciated. I\n      would in vain attempt to portray the majesty, the quiet ease, of\n      her demeanor, or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of\n      her footfall. She came and departed as a shadow. I was never made\n      aware of her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music\n      of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand upon my\r\nshoulder. In beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her. It was\n      the radiance of an opium-dream—an airy and spirit-lifting vision\n      more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered about the\n      slumbering souls of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were\n      not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to\n      worship in the classical labors of the heathen. “There is no\n      exquisite beauty,” says Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of\n      all the forms and genera of beauty, “without some strangeness in\n      the proportion.” Yet, although I saw that the features of Ligeia\r\nwere not of a classic regularity—although I perceived that her\n      loveliness was indeed “exquisite,” and felt that there was much\n      of “strangeness” pervading it, yet I have tried in vain to detect\n      the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of “the\n      strange.” I examined the contour of the lofty and pale\n      forehead—it was faultless—how cold indeed that word when applied\n      to a majesty so divine!—the skin rivalling the purest ivory, the\n      commanding extent and repose, the gentle prominence of the\n      regions above the temples; and then the raven-black, the glossy,","the luxuriant and naturally-curling tresses, setting forth the\n      full force of the Homeric epithet, “hyacinthine!” I looked at the\n      delicate outlines of the nose—and nowhere but in the graceful\n      medallions of the Hebrews had I beheld a similar perfection.\n      There were the same luxurious smoothness of surface, the same\n      scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the same\n      harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit. I regarded\n      the sweet mouth. Here was indeed the triumph of all things\n      heavenly—the magnificent turn of the short upper lip—the soft,\n      voluptuous slumber of the under—the dimples which sported, and\r\nthe color which spoke—the teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy\n      almost startling, every ray of the holy light which fell upon\n      them in her serene and placid, yet most exultingly radiant of all\n      smiles. I scrutinized the formation of the chin—and here, too, I\n      found the gentleness of breadth, the softness and the majesty,\n      the fullness and the spirituality, of the Greek—the contour which\n      the god Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the son of\n      the Athenian. And then I peered into the large eyes of Ligeia.\n\n      For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might have\r\nbeen, too, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to\n      which Lord Verulam alludes. They were, I must believe, far larger\n      than the ordinary eyes of our own race. They were even fuller\n      than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley\n      of Nourjahad. Yet it was only at intervals—in moments of intense\n      excitement—that this peculiarity became more than slightly\n      noticeable in Ligeia. And at such moments was her beauty—in my\n      heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps—the beauty of beings either\n      above or apart from the earth—the beauty of the fabulous Houri of","the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black,\n      and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows,\n      slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The\n      “strangeness,” however, which I found in the eyes, was of a\n      nature distinct from the formation, or the color, or the\n      brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred to\n      the expression. Ah, word of no meaning! behind whose vast\n      latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of\n      the spiritual. The expression of the eyes of Ligeia! How for long\r\nhours have I pondered upon it! How have I, through the whole of a\n      midsummer night, struggled to fathom it! What was it—that\n      something more profound than the well of Democritus—which lay far\n      within the pupils of my beloved? What was it? I was possessed\n      with a passion to discover. Those eyes! those large, those\n      shining, those divine orbs! they became to me twin stars of Leda,\n      and I to them devoutest of astrologers.\n\n      There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of\n      the science of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the\n      fact—never, I believe, noticed in the schools—that, in our\r\nendeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten, we often\n      find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance, without being\n      able, in the end, to remember. And thus how frequently, in my\n      intense scrutiny of Ligeia’s eyes, have I felt approaching the\n      full knowledge of their expression—felt it approaching—yet not\n      quite be mine—and so at length entirely depart! And (strange, oh\n      strangest mystery of all!) I found, in the commonest objects of\n      the universe, a circle of analogies to that expression. I mean to\n      say that, subsequently to the period when Ligeia’s beauty passed","into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from\n      many existences in the material world, a sentiment such as I felt\n      always aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs. Yet not\n      the more could I define that sentiment, or analyze, or even\n      steadily view it. I recognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in\n      the survey of a rapidly-growing vine—in the contemplation of a\n      moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a stream of running water. I have\n      felt it in the ocean—in the falling of a meteor. I have felt it\n      in the glances of unusually aged people. And there are one or two\r\nstars in heaven—(one especially, a star of the sixth magnitude,\n      double and changeable, to be found near the large star in Lyra)\n      in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made aware of the\n      feeling. I have been filled with it by certain sounds from\n      stringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passages from\n      books. Among innumerable other instances, I well remember\n      something in a volume of Joseph Glanvill, which (perhaps merely\n      from its quaintness—who shall say?) never failed to inspire me\n      with the sentiment: “And the will therein lieth, which dieth not.\r\nWho knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God is\n      but a great will pervading all things by nature of its\n      intentness. Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death\n      utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.”\n\n      Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to\n      trace, indeed, some remote connection between this passage in the\n      English moralist and a portion of the character of Ligeia. An\n      intensity in thought, action, or speech, was possibly, in her, a\n      result, or at least an index, of that gigantic volition which,","during our long intercourse, failed to give other and more\n      immediate evidence of its existence. Of all the women whom I have\n      ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid Ligeia, was\n      the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern\n      passion. And of such passion I could form no estimate, save by\n      the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted\n      and appalled me—by the almost magical melody, modulation,\n      distinctness and placidity of her very low voice—and by the\n      fierce energy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her\r\nmanner of utterance) of the wild words which she habitually\n      uttered.\n\n      I have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was immense—such as I\n      have never known in woman. In the classical tongues was she\n      deeply proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in\n      regard to the modern dialects of Europe, I have never known her\n      at fault. Indeed upon any theme of the most admired, because\n      simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy,\n      have I ever found Ligeia at fault? How singularly—how\n      thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife has forced\r\nitself, at this late period only, upon my attention! I said her\n      knowledge was such as I have never known in woman—but where\n      breathes the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the\n      wide areas of moral, physical, and mathematical science? I saw\n      not then what I now clearly perceive, that the acquisitions of\n      Ligeia were gigantic, were astounding; yet I was sufficiently\n      aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself, with a\n      child-like confidence, to her guidance through the chaotic world\n      of metaphysical investigation at which I was most busily occupied","during the earlier years of our marriage. With how vast a\n      triumph—with how vivid a delight—with how much of all that is\n      ethereal in hope did I feel, as she bent over me in studies but\n      little sought—but less known—that delicious vista by slow degrees\n      expanding before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden\n      path, I might at length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too\n      divinely precious not to be forbidden!\n\n      How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after\n      some years, I beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to\n      themselves and fly away! Without Ligeia I was but as a child\r\ngroping benighted. Her presence, her readings alone, rendered\n      vividly luminous the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in\n      which we were immersed. Wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes,\n      letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than Saturnian lead. And\n      now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over\n      which I pored. Ligeia grew ill. The wild eyes blazed with a\n      too—too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the\n      transparent waxen hue of the grave; and the blue veins upon the\n      lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the\r\ngentle emotion. I saw that she must die—and I struggled\n      desperately in spirit with the grim Azrael. And the struggles of\n      the passionate wife were, to my astonishment, even more energetic\n      than my own. There had been much in her stern nature to impress\n      me with the belief that, to her, death would have come without\n      its terrors; but not so. Words are impotent to convey any just\n      idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with\n      the Shadow. I groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle. I\n      would have soothed—I would have reasoned; but, in the intensity","of her wild desire for life,—for life—but for life—solace and\n      reason were the uttermost folly. Yet not until the last instance,\n      amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was\n      shaken the external placidity of her demeanor. Her voice grew\n      more gentle—grew more low—yet I would not wish to dwell upon the\n      wild meaning of the quietly uttered words. My brain reeled as I\n      hearkened, entranced, to a melody more than mortal—to assumptions\n      and aspirations which mortality had never before known.\n\n      That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might have\r\nbeen easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have\n      reigned no ordinary passion. But in death only, was I fully\n      impressed with the strength of her affection. For long hours,\n      detaining my hand, would she pour out before me the overflowing\n      of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to\n      idolatry. How had I deserved to be so blessed by such\n      confessions?—how had I deserved to be so cursed with the removal\n      of my beloved in the hour of her making them? But upon this\n      subject I cannot bear to dilate. Let me say only, that in\r\nLigeia’s more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all\n      unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length recognized the\n      principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a desire for the\n      life which was now fleeing so rapidly away. It is this wild\n      longing—it is this eager vehemence of desire for life—but for\n      life—that I have no power to portray—no utterance capable of\n      expressing.\n\n      At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me,\n      peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses\n      composed by herself not many days before. I obeyed her. They were","these:\n\nLo! ’tis a gala night\n    Within the lonesome latter years!\nAn angel throng, bewinged, bedight\n    In veils, and drowned in tears,\nSit in a theatre, to see\n    A play of hopes and fears,\nWhile the orchestra breathes fitfully\n    The music of the spheres.\n\nMimes, in the form of God on high,\n    Mutter and mumble low,\nAnd hither and thither fly;\n    Mere puppets they, who come and go\nAt bidding of vast formless things\n    That shift the scenery to and fro,\nFlapping from out their Condor wings\n    Invisible Wo!\n\nThat motley drama!—oh, be sure\n    It shall not be forgot!\nWith its Phantom chased forever more,\r\nBy a crowd that seize it not,\nThrough a circle that ever returneth in\n    To the self-same spot,\nAnd much of Madness and more of Sin\n    And Horror the soul of the plot.\n\nBut see, amid the mimic rout,\n    A crawling shape intrude!\nA blood-red thing that writhes from out\n    The scenic solitude!\nIt writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs\n    The mimes become its food,\nAnd the seraphs sob at vermin fangs\n    In human gore imbued.\n\nOut—out are the lights—out all!\n    And over each quivering form,\nThe curtain, a funeral pall,\n    Comes down with the rush of a storm,\nAnd the angels, all pallid and wan,\r\nUprising, unveiling, affirm\nThat the play is the tragedy, “Man,”\n    And its hero the Conqueror Worm.\n\n      “O God!” half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending\n      her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of\n      these lines—“O God! O Divine Father!—shall these things be\n      undeviatingly so?—shall this Conqueror be not once conquered? Are\n      we not part and parcel in Thee? Who—who knoweth the mysteries of\n      the will with its vigor? Man doth not yield him to the angels,\n      nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his\n      feeble will.”","And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white\n      arms to fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as\n      she breathed her last sighs, there came mingled with them a low\n      murmur from her lips. I bent to them my ear and distinguished,\n      again, the concluding words of the passage in Glanvill—“Man doth\n      not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only\n      through the weakness of his feeble will.”\n\n      She died: and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no\n      longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and\n      decaying city by the Rhine. I had no lack of what the world calls\r\nwealth. Ligeia had brought me far more, very far more than\n      ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals. After a few months,\n      therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, I purchased, and put\n      in some repair, an abbey, which I shall not name, in one of the\n      wildest and least frequented portions of fair England. The gloomy\n      and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost savage aspect of\n      the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored memories\n      connected with both, had much in unison with the feelings of\n      utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and\r\nunsocial region of the country. Yet although the external abbey,\n      with its verdant decay hanging about it, suffered but little\n      alteration, I gave way, with a child-like perversity, and\n      perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to a\n      display of more than regal magnificence within. For such follies,\n      even in childhood, I had imbibed a taste and now they came back\n      to me as if in the dotage of grief. Alas, I feel how much even of\n      incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and\n      fantastic draperies, in the solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild","cornices and furniture, in the Bedlam patterns of the carpets of\n      tufted gold! I had become a bounden slave in the trammels of\n      opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my\n      dreams. But these absurdities I must not pause to detail. Let me\n      speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed, whither in a\n      moment of mental alienation, I led from the altar as my bride—as\n      the successor of the unforgotten Ligeia—the fair-haired and\n      blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion, of Tremaine.\n\n      There is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration\r\nof that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me. Where\n      were the souls of the haughty family of the bride, when, through\n      thirst of gold, they permitted to pass the threshold of an\n      apartment so bedecked, a maiden and a daughter so beloved? I have\n      said that I minutely remember the details of the chamber—yet I am\n      sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment—and here there was no\n      system, no keeping, in the fantastic display, to take hold upon\n      the memory. The room lay in a high turret of the castellated\n      abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size. Occupying\r\nthe whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole window—an\n      immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice—a single pane, and\n      tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or\n      moon, passing through it, fell with a ghastly lustre on the\n      objects within. Over the upper portion of this huge window,\n      extended the trellice-work of an aged vine, which clambered up\n      the massy walls of the turret. The ceiling, of gloomy-looking\n      oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and elaborately fretted with\n      the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-Gothic,","semi-Druidical device. From out the most central recess of this\n      melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single chain of gold with\n      long links, a huge censer of the same metal, Saracenic in\n      pattern, and with many perforations so contrived that there\n      writhed in and out of them, as if endued with a serpent vitality,\n      a continual succession of parti-colored fires.\n\n      Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were\n      in various stations about—and there was the couch, too—bridal\n      couch—of an Indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony,\n      with a pall-like canopy above. In each of the angles of the\r\nchamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite,\n      from the tombs of the kings over against Luxor, with their aged\n      lids full of immemorial sculpture. But in the draping of the\n      apartment lay, alas! the chief phantasy of all. The lofty walls,\n      gigantic in height—even unproportionably so—were hung from summit\n      to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and massive-looking\n      tapestry—tapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet\n      on the floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed,\n      as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the\r\ncurtains which partially shaded the window. The material was the\n      richest cloth of gold. It was spotted all over, at irregular\n      intervals, with arabesque figures, about a foot in diameter, and\n      wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty black. But\n      these figures partook of the true character of the arabesque only\n      when regarded from a single point of view. By a contrivance now\n      common, and indeed traceable to a very remote period of\n      antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. To one entering\n      the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; but","upon a farther advance, this appearance gradually departed; and\n      step by step, as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he\n      saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly\n      forms which belong to the superstition of the Norman, or arise in\n      the guilty slumbers of the monk. The phantasmagoric effect was\n      vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong\n      continual current of wind behind the draperies—giving a hideous\n      and uneasy animation to the whole.\n\n      In halls such as these—in a bridal chamber such as this—I passed,\r\nwith the Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first\n      month of our marriage—passed them with but little disquietude.\n      That my wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temper—that she\n      shunned me and loved me but little—I could not help perceiving;\n      but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise. I loathed her with\n      a hatred belonging more to demon than to man. My memory flew\n      back, (oh, with what intensity of regret!) to Ligeia, the\n      beloved, the august, the beautiful, the entombed. I revelled in\n      recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty, her\r\nethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. Now,\n      then, did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the\n      fires of her own. In the excitement of my opium dreams (for I was\n      habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug) I would call\n      aloud upon her name, during the silence of the night, or among\n      the sheltered recesses of the glens by day, as if, through the\n      wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor of my\n      longing for the departed, I could restore her to the pathway she\n      had abandoned—ah, could it be forever?—upon the earth.","About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the\n      Lady Rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her\n      recovery was slow. The fever which consumed her rendered her\n      nights uneasy; and in her perturbed state of half-slumber, she\n      spoke of sounds, and of motions, in and about the chamber of the\n      turret, which I concluded had no origin save in the distemper of\n      her fancy, or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences of the\n      chamber itself. She became at length convalescent—finally well.\n      Yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a second more violent\r\ndisorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from this\n      attack her frame, at all times feeble, never altogether\n      recovered. Her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming\n      character, and of more alarming recurrence, defying alike the\n      knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians. With the\n      increase of the chronic disease which had thus, apparently, taken\n      too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human\n      means, I could not fail to observe a similar increase in the\n      nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her excitability by\r\ntrivial causes of fear. She spoke again, and now more frequently\n      and pertinaciously, of the sounds—of the slight sounds—and of the\n      unusual motions among the tapestries, to which she had formerly\n      alluded.\n\n      One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this\n      distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my\n      attention. She had just awakened from an unquiet slumber, and I\n      had been watching, with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague\n      terror, the workings of her emaciated countenance. I sat by the\n      side of her ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans of India. She","partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of sounds\n      which she then heard, but which I could not hear—of motions which\n      she then saw, but which I could not perceive. The wind was\n      rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries, and I wished to show her\n      (what, let me confess it, I could not all believe) that those\n      almost inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations\n      of the figures upon the wall, were but the natural effects of\n      that customary rushing of the wind. But a deadly pallor,\n      overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions to\r\nreassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to be fainting, and\n      no attendants were within call. I remembered where was deposited\n      a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her\n      physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it. But,\n      as I stepped beneath the light of the censer, two circumstances\n      of a startling nature attracted my attention. I had felt that\n      some palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my\n      person; and I saw that there lay upon the golden carpet, in the\n      very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the censer, a shadow—a\r\nfaint, indefinite shadow of angelic aspect—such as might be\n      fancied for the shadow of a shade. But I was wild with the\n      excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and heeded these\n      things but little, nor spoke of them to Rowena. Having found the\n      wine, I recrossed the chamber, and poured out a gobletful, which\n      I held to the lips of the fainting lady. She had now partially\n      recovered, however, and took the vessel herself, while I sank\n      upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person.\n      It was then that I became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall","upon the carpet, and near the couch; and in a second thereafter,\n      as Rowena was in the act of raising the wine to her lips, I saw,\n      or may have dreamed that I saw, fall within the goblet, as if\n      from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room, three\n      or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid. If\n      this I saw—not so Rowena. She swallowed the wine unhesitatingly,\n      and I forbore to speak to her of a circumstance which must, after\n      all, I considered, have been but the suggestion of a vivid\n      imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady,\n      by the opium, and by the hour.\r\nYet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately\n      subsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the\n      worse took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on the\n      third subsequent night, the hands of her menials prepared her for\n      the tomb, and on the fourth, I sat alone, with her shrouded body,\n      in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride.\n      Wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like, before me.\n      I gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the\n      room, upon the varying figures of the drapery, and upon the\r\nwrithing of the parti-colored fires in the censer overhead. My\n      eyes then fell, as I called to mind the circumstances of a former\n      night, to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where I had\n      seen the faint traces of the shadow. It was there, however, no\n      longer; and breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances\n      to the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed. Then rushed upon me\n      a thousand memories of Ligeia—and then came back upon my heart,\n      with the turbulent violence of a flood, the whole of that\n      unutterable woe with which I had regarded her thus enshrouded.","The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter thoughts\n      of the one only and supremely beloved, I remained gazing upon the\n      body of Rowena.\n\n      It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I\n      had taken no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very\n      distinct, startled me from my revery. I _felt_ that it came from\n      the bed of ebony—the bed of death. I listened in an agony of\n      superstitious terror—but there was no repetition of the sound. I\n      strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpse—but there\n      was not the slightest perceptible. Yet I could not have been\r\ndeceived. I had heard the noise, however faint, and my soul was\n      awakened within me. I resolutely and perseveringly kept my\n      attention riveted upon the body. Many minutes elapsed before any\n      circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery. At\n      length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely\n      noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and\n      along the sunken small veins of the eyelids. Through a species of\n      unutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality\n      has no sufficiently energetic expression, I felt my heart cease\r\nto beat, my limbs grow rigid where I sat. Yet a sense of duty\n      finally operated to restore my self-possession. I could no longer\n      doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparations—that\n      Rowena still lived. It was necessary that some immediate exertion\n      be made; yet the turret was altogether apart from the portion of\n      the abbey tenanted by the servants—there were none within call—I\n      had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room\n      for many minutes—and this I could not venture to do. I therefore\n      struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit ill","hovering. In a short period it was certain, however, that a\n      relapse had taken place; the color disappeared from both eyelid\n      and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of marble; the\n      lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly\n      expression of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness\n      overspread rapidly the surface of the body; and all the usual\n      rigorous illness immediately supervened. I fell back with a\n      shudder upon the couch from which I had been so startlingly\n      aroused, and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions of\n      Ligeia.\r\nAn hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?) I was a second\n      time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the\n      bed. I listened—in extremity of horror. The sound came again—it\n      was a sigh. Rushing to the corpse, I saw—distinctly saw—a tremor\n      upon the lips. In a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a\n      bright line of the pearly teeth. Amazement now struggled in my\n      bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there\n      alone. I felt that my vision grew dim, that my reason wandered;\n      and it was only by a violent effort that I at length succeeded in\r\nnerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had pointed\n      out. There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the\n      cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame;\n      there was even a slight pulsation at the heart. The lady lived;\n      and with redoubled ardor I betook myself to the task of\n      restoration. I chafed and bathed the temples and the hands, and\n      used every exertion which experience, and no little medical\n      reading, could suggest. But in vain. Suddenly, the color fled,\n      the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of the","dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body took upon\n      itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense rigidity,\n      the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of that\n      which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.\n\n      And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia—and again, (what marvel\n      that I shudder while I write?), again there reached my ears a low\n      sob from the region of the ebony bed. But why shall I minutely\n      detail the unspeakable horrors of that night? Why shall I pause\n      to relate how, time after time, until near the period of the gray\r\ndawn, this hideous drama of revivification was repeated; how each\n      terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more\n      irredeemable death; how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle\n      with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was succeeded by I\n      know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of the\n      corpse? Let me hurry to a conclusion.\n\n      The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who\n      had been dead, once again stirred—and now more vigorously than\n      hitherto, although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in\r\nits utter hopelessness than any. I had long ceased to struggle or\n      to move, and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a\n      helpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions, of which extreme\n      awe was perhaps the least terrible, the least consuming. The\n      corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously than before.\n      The hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the\n      countenance—the limbs relaxed—and, save that the eyelids were yet\n      pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of\n      the grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure, I","might have dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly,\n      the fetters of Death. But if this idea was not, even then,\n      altogether adopted, I could at least doubt no longer, when,\n      arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble steps, with closed\n      eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream, the thing\n      that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the middle\n      of the apartment.\n\n      I trembled not—I stirred not—for a crowd of unutterable fancies\n      connected with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure,\n      rushing hurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed—had chilled me\r\ninto stone. I stirred not—but gazed upon the apparition. There\n      was a mad disorder in my thoughts—a tumult unappeasable. Could\n      it, indeed, be the living Rowena who confronted me? Could it\n      indeed be Rowena at all—the fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady\n      Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine? Why, why should I doubt it? The\n      bandage lay heavily about the mouth—but then might it not be the\n      mouth of the breathing Lady of Tremaine? And the cheeks—there\n      were the roses as in her noon of life—yes, these might indeed be\n      the fair cheeks of the living Lady of Tremaine. And the chin,\r\nwith its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?—but had she\n      then grown taller since her malady? What inexpressible madness\n      seized me with that thought? One bound, and I had reached her\n      feet! Shrinking from my touch, she let fall from her head,\n      unloosened, the ghastly cerements which had confined it, and\n      there streamed forth, into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber,\n      huge masses of long and dishevelled hair; _it was blacker than\n      the raven wings of the midnight!_ And now slowly opened the eyes\n      of the figure which stood before me. “Here then, at least,” I","shrieked aloud, “can I never—can I never be mistaken—these are\n      the full, and the black, and the wild eyes—of my lost love—of the\n      Lady—of the LADY LIGEIA.”\n\n\n\n\nMORELLA\n\n\n     Itself, by itself, solely, one everlasting, and single.\n                    —PLATO—_Sympos_.\n\n      With a feeling of deep yet most singular affection I regarded my\n      friend Morella. Thrown by accident into her society many years\n      ago, my soul from our first meeting, burned with fires it had\n      never before known; but the fires were not of Eros, and bitter\n      and tormenting to my spirit was the gradual conviction that I\r\ncould in no manner define their unusual meaning or regulate their\n      vague intensity. Yet we met; and fate bound us together at the\n      altar; and I never spoke of passion nor thought of love. She,\n      however, shunned society, and, attaching herself to me alone\n      rendered me happy. It is a happiness to wonder; it is a happiness\n      to dream.\n\n      Morella’s erudition was profound. As I hope to live, her talents\n      were of no common order—her powers of mind were gigantic. I felt\n      this, and, in many matters, became her pupil. I soon, however,\n      found that, perhaps on account of her Presburg education, she\r\nplaced before me a number of those mystical writings which are\n      usually considered the mere dross of the early German literature.\n      These, for what reason I could not imagine, were her favourite\n      and constant study—and that in process of time they became my\n      own, should be attributed to the simple but effectual influence\n      of habit and example.\n\n      In all this, if I err not, my reason had little to do. My\n      convictions, or I forget myself, were in no manner acted upon by\n      the ideal, nor was any tincture of the mysticism which I read to\n      be discovered, unless I am greatly mistaken, either in my deeds","or in my thoughts. Persuaded of this, I abandoned myself\n      implicitly to the guidance of my wife, and entered with an\n      unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies. And\n      then—then, when, poring over forbidden pages, I felt a forbidden\n      spirit enkindling within me—would Morella place her cold hand\n      upon my own, and rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some\n      low, singular words, whose strange meaning burned themselves in\n      upon my memory. And then, hour after hour, would I linger by her\n      side, and dwell upon the music of her voice, until at length its\r\nmelody was tainted with terror, and there fell a shadow upon my\n      soul, and I grew pale, and shuddered inwardly at those too\n      unearthly tones. And thus, joy suddenly faded into horror, and\n      the most beautiful became the most hideous, as Hinnon became\n      Ge-Henna.\n\n      It is unnecessary to state the exact character of those\n      disquisitions which, growing out of the volumes I have mentioned,\n      formed, for so long a time, almost the sole conversation of\n      Morella and myself. By the learned in what might be termed\n      theological morality they will be readily conceived, and by the\r\nunlearned they would, at all events, be little understood. The\n      wild Pantheism of Fichte; the modified Paliggenedia of the\n      Pythagoreans; and, above all, the doctrines of Identity as urged\n      by Schelling, were generally the points of discussion presenting\n      the most of beauty to the imaginative Morella. That identity\n      which is termed personal, Mr. Locke, I think, truly defines to\n      consist in the saneness of rational being. And since by person we\n      understand an intelligent essence having reason, and since there\n      is a consciousness which always accompanies thinking, it is this","which makes us all to be that which we call _ourselves_—thereby\n      distinguishing us from other beings that think, and giving us our\n      personal identity. But the _principium indivduationis_, the\n      notion of that identity _which at death is or is not lost\n      forever_—was to me, at all times, a consideration of intense\n      interest; not more from the perplexing and exciting nature of its\n      consequences, than from the marked and agitated manner in which\n      Morella mentioned them.\n\n      But, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of my\n      wife’s manner oppressed me as a spell. I could no longer bear the\r\ntouch of her wan fingers, nor the low tone of her musical\n      language, nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes. And she knew all\n      this, but did not upbraid; she seemed conscious of my weakness or\n      my folly, and, smiling, called it Fate. She seemed, also,\n      conscious of a cause, to me unknown, for the gradual alienation\n      of my regard; but she gave me no hint or token of its nature. Yet\n      was she woman, and pined away daily. In time the crimson spot\n      settled steadily upon the cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale\n      forehead became prominent; and one instant my nature melted into\r\npity, but in, next I met the glance of her meaning eyes, and then\n      my soul sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who\n      gazes downward into some dreary and unfathomable abyss.\n\n      Shall I then say that I longed with an earnest and consuming\n      desire for the moment of Morella’s decease? I did; but the\n      fragile spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many days—for\n      many weeks and irksome months, until my tortured nerves obtained\n      the mastery over my mind, and I grew furious through delay, and,\n      with the heart of a fiend, cursed the days and the hours and the","bitter moments, which seemed to lengthen and lengthen as her\n      gentle life declined—like shadows in the dying of the day.\n\n      But one autumnal evening, when the winds lay still in heaven,\n      Morella called me to her bedside. There was a dim mist over all\n      the earth, and a warm glow upon the waters, and amid the rich\n      October leaves of the forest, a rainbow from the firmament had\n      surely fallen.\n\n      “It is a day of days,” she said, as I approached; “a day of all\n      days either to live or die. It is a fair day for the sons of\n      earth and life—ah, more fair for the daughters of heaven and\r\ndeath!”\n\n      I kissed her forehead, and she continued:\n\n      “I am dying, yet shall I live.”\n\n      “Morella!”\n\n      “The days have never been when thou couldst love me—but her whom\n      in life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt adore.”\n\n      “Morella!”\n\n      “I repeat that I am dying. But within me is a pledge of that\n      affection—ah, how little!—which thou didst feel for me, Morella.\n      And when my spirit departs shall the child live—thy child and\n      mine, Morella’s. But thy days shall be days of sorrow—that sorrow\n      which is the most lasting of impressions, as the cypress is the\r\nmost enduring of trees. For the hours of thy happiness are over\n      and joy is not gathered twice in a life, as the roses of Paestum\n      twice in a year. Thou shalt no longer, then, play the Teian with\n      time, but, being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine, thou shalt\n      bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth, as do the Moslemin\n      at Mecca.”\n\n      “Morella!” I cried, “Morella! how knowest thou this?” but she\n      turned away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming\n      over her limbs, she thus died, and I heard her voice no more.\n\n      Yet, as she had foretold, her child, to which in dying she had","given birth, which breathed not until the mother breathed no\n      more, her child, a daughter, lived. And she grew strangely in\n      stature and intellect, and was the perfect resemblance of her who\n      had departed, and I loved her with a love more fervent than I had\n      believed it possible to feel for any denizen of earth.\n\n      But, ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened,\n      and gloom, and horror, and grief swept over it in clouds. I said\n      the child grew strangely in stature and intelligence. Strange,\n      indeed, was her rapid increase in bodily size—but terrible, oh!\r\nterrible were the tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while\n      watching the development of her mental being. Could it be\n      otherwise, when I daily discovered in the conceptions of the\n      child the adult powers and faculties of the woman?—when the\n      lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy? and when the\n      wisdom or the passions of maturity I found hourly gleaming from\n      its full and speculative eye? When, I say, all this became\n      evident to my appalled senses—when I could no longer hide it from\n      my soul, nor throw it off from those perceptions which trembled\r\nto receive it—is it to be wondered at that suspicions, of a\n      nature fearful and exciting, crept in upon my spirit, or that my\n      thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales and thrilling\n      theories of the entombed Morella? I snatched from the scrutiny of\n      the world a being whom destiny compelled me to adore, and in the\n      rigorous seclusion of my home, watched with an agonizing anxiety\n      over all which concerned the beloved.\n\n      And as years rolled away, and I gazed day after day upon her\n      holy, and mild, and eloquent face, and poured over her maturing","form, day after day did I discover new points of resemblance in\n      the child to her mother, the melancholy and the dead. And hourly\n      grew darker these shadows of similitude, and more full, and more\n      definite, and more perplexing, and more hideously terrible in\n      their aspect. For that her smile was like her mother’s I could\n      bear; but then I shuddered at its too perfect _identity_—that her\n      eyes were like Morella’s I could endure; but then they, too,\n      often looked down into the depths of my soul with Morella’s own\n      intense and bewildering meaning. And in the contour of the high\r\nforehead, and in the ringlets of the silken hair, and in the wan\n      fingers which buried themselves therein, and in the sad musical\n      tones of her speech, and above all—oh! above all—in the phrases\n      and expressions of the dead on the lips of the loved and the\n      living, I found food for consuming thought and horror—for a worm\n      that _would_ not die.\n\n      Thus passed away two lustra of her life, and as yet my daughter\n      remained nameless upon the earth. “My child,” and “my love,” were\n      the designations usually prompted by a father’s affection, and\n      the rigid seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse.\r\nMorella’s name died with her at her death. Of the mother I had\n      never spoken to the daughter;—it was impossible to speak. Indeed,\n      during the brief period of her existence, the latter had received\n      no impressions from the outward world, save such as might have\n      been afforded by the narrow limits of her privacy. But at length\n      the ceremony of baptism presented to my mind, in its unnerved and\n      agitated condition, a present deliverance from the terrors of my\n      destiny. And at the baptismal font I hesitated for a name. And\n      many titles of the wise and beautiful, of old and modern times,","of my own and foreign lands, came thronging to my lips, with\n      many, many fair titles of the gentle, and the happy, and the\n      good. What prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried\n      dead? What demon urged me to breathe that sound, which in its\n      very recollection was wont to make ebb the purple blood in\n      torrents from the temples to the heart? What fiend spoke from the\n      recesses of my soul, when amid those dim aisles, and in the\n      silence of the night, I whispered within the ears of the holy man\n      the syllables—Morella? What more than fiend convulsed the\r\nfeatures of my child, and overspread them with hues of death, as\n      starting at that scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy\n      eyes from the earth to heaven, and falling prostrate on the black\n      slabs of our ancestral vault, responded—“I am here!”\n\n      Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell those few simple sounds\n      within my ear, and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into\n      my brain. Years—years may pass away, but the memory of that\n      epoch—never! Nor was I indeed ignorant of the flowers and the\n      vine—but the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed me night and\r\nday. And I kept no reckoning of time or place, and the stars of\n      my fate faded from heaven, and therefore the earth grew dark, and\n      its figures passed by me like flitting shadows, and among them\n      all I beheld only—Morella. The winds of the firmament breathed\n      but one sound within my ears, and the ripples upon the sea\n      murmured evermore—Morella. But she died; and with my own hands I\n      bore her to the tomb; and I laughed with a long and bitter laugh\n      as I found no traces of the first in the charnel where I laid the\n      second, Morella.\n\n\n\n\nA TALE OF THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS","During the fall of the year 1827, while residing near\n      Charlottesville, Virginia, I casually made the acquaintance of\n      Mr. Augustus Bedloe. This young gentleman was remarkable in every\n      respect, and excited in me a profound interest and curiosity. I\n      found it impossible to comprehend him either in his moral or his\n      physical relations. Of his family I could obtain no satisfactory\n      account. Whence he came, I never ascertained. Even about his\n      age—although I call him a young gentleman—there was something\n      which perplexed me in no little degree. He certainly seemed\r\nyoung—and he made a point of speaking about his youth—yet there\n      were moments when I should have had little trouble in imagining\n      him a hundred years of age. But in no regard was he more peculiar\n      than in his personal appearance. He was singularly tall and thin.\n      He stooped much. His limbs were exceedingly long and emaciated.\n      His forehead was broad and low. His complexion was absolutely\n      bloodless. His mouth was large and flexible, and his teeth were\n      more wildly uneven, although sound, than I had ever before seen\n      teeth in a human head. The expression of his smile, however, was\r\nby no means unpleasing, as might be supposed; but it had no\n      variation whatever. It was one of profound melancholy—of a\n      phaseless and unceasing gloom. His eyes were abnormally large,\n      and round like those of a cat. The pupils, too, upon any\n      accession or diminution of light, underwent contraction or\n      dilation, just such as is observed in the feline tribe. In\n      moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost\n      inconceivable; seeming to emit luminous rays, not of a reflected\n      but of an intrinsic lustre, as does a candle or the sun; yet\n      their ordinary condition was so totally vapid, filmy, and dull as","to convey the idea of the eyes of a long-interred corpse.\n\n      These peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much\n      annoyance, and he was continually alluding to them in a sort of\n      half explanatory, half apologetic strain, which, when I first\n      heard it, impressed me very painfully. I soon, however, grew\n      accustomed to it, and my uneasiness wore off. It seemed to be his\n      design rather to insinuate than directly to assert that,\n      physically, he had not always been what he was—that a long series\n      of neuralgic attacks had reduced him from a condition of more\r\nthan usual personal beauty, to that which I saw. For many years\n      past he had been attended by a physician, named Templeton—an old\n      gentleman, perhaps seventy years of age—whom he had first\n      encountered at Saratoga, and from whose attention, while there,\n      he either received, or fancied that he received, great benefit.\n      The result was that Bedloe, who was wealthy, had made an\n      arrangement with Dr. Templeton, by which the latter, in\n      consideration of a liberal annual allowance, had consented to\n      devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the care of\n      the invalid.\r\nDoctor Templeton had been a traveller in his younger days, and at\n      Paris had become a convert, in great measure, to the doctrines of\n      Mesmer. It was altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he\n      had succeeded in alleviating the acute pains of his patient; and\n      this success had very naturally inspired the latter with a\n      certain degree of confidence in the opinions from which the\n      remedies had been educed. The Doctor, however, like all\n      enthusiasts, had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of his\n      pupil, and finally so far gained his point as to induce the","sufferer to submit to numerous experiments. By a frequent\n      repetition of these, a result had arisen, which of late days has\n      become so common as to attract little or no attention, but which,\n      at the period of which I write, had very rarely been known in\n      America. I mean to say, that between Doctor Templeton and Bedloe\n      there had grown up, little by little, a very distinct and\n      strongly marked rapport, or magnetic relation. I am not prepared\n      to assert, however, that this rapport extended beyond the limits\n      of the simple sleep-producing power, but this power itself had\r\nattained great intensity. At the first attempt to induce the\n      magnetic somnolency, the mesmerist entirely failed. In the fifth\n      or sixth he succeeded very partially, and after long continued\n      effort. Only at the twelfth was the triumph complete. After this\n      the will of the patient succumbed rapidly to that of the\n      physician, so that, when I first became acquainted with the two,\n      sleep was brought about almost instantaneously by the mere\n      volition of the operator, even when the invalid was unaware of\n      his presence. It is only now, in the year 1845, when similar\r\nmiracles are witnessed daily by thousands, that I dare venture to\n      record this apparent impossibility as a matter of serious fact.\n\n      The temperature of Bedloe was, in the highest degree sensitive,\n      excitable, enthusiastic. His imagination was singularly vigorous\n      and creative; and no doubt it derived additional force from the\n      habitual use of morphine, which he swallowed in great quantity,\n      and without which he would have found it impossible to exist. It\n      was his practice to take a very large dose of it immediately\n      after breakfast each morning—or, rather, immediately after a cup","of strong coffee, for he ate nothing in the forenoon—and then set\n      forth alone, or attended only by a dog, upon a long ramble among\n      the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward and\n      southward of Charlottesville, and are there dignified by the\n      title of the Ragged Mountains.\n\n      Upon a dim, warm, misty day, toward the close of November, and\n      during the strange interregnum of the seasons which in America is\n      termed the Indian Summer, Mr. Bedloe departed as usual for the\n      hills. The day passed, and still he did not return.\n\n      About eight o’clock at night, having become seriously alarmed at\r\nhis protracted absence, we were about setting out in search of\n      him, when he unexpectedly made his appearance, in health no worse\n      than usual, and in rather more than ordinary spirits. The account\n      which he gave of his expedition, and of the events which had\n      detained him, was a singular one indeed.\n\n      “You will remember,” said he, “that it was about nine in the\n      morning when I left Charlottesville. I bent my steps immediately\n      to the mountains, and, about ten, entered a gorge which was\n      entirely new to me. I followed the windings of this pass with\n      much interest. The scenery which presented itself on all sides,\r\nalthough scarcely entitled to be called grand, had about it an\n      indescribable and to me a delicious aspect of dreary desolation.\n      The solitude seemed absolutely virgin. I could not help believing\n      that the green sods and the gray rocks upon which I trod had been\n      trodden never before by the foot of a human being. So entirely\n      secluded, and in fact inaccessible, except through a series of\n      accidents, is the entrance of the ravine, that it is by no means\n      impossible that I was indeed the first adventurer—the very first\n      and sole adventurer who had ever penetrated its recesses.","“The thick and peculiar mist, or smoke, which distinguishes the\n      Indian Summer, and which now hung heavily over all objects,\n      served, no doubt, to deepen the vague impressions which these\n      objects created. So dense was this pleasant fog that I could at\n      no time see more than a dozen yards of the path before me. This\n      path was excessively sinuous, and as the sun could not be seen, I\n      soon lost all idea of the direction in which I journeyed. In the\n      meantime the morphine had its customary effect—that of enduing\n      all the external world with an intensity of interest. In the\r\nquivering of a leaf—in the hue of a blade of grass—in the shape\n      of a trefoil—in the humming of a bee—in the gleaming of a\n      dew-drop—in the breathing of the wind—in the faint odors that\n      came from the forest—there came a whole universe of suggestion—a\n      gay and motley train of rhapsodical and immethodical thought.\n\n      “Busied in this, I walked on for several hours, during which the\n      mist deepened around me to so great an extent that at length I\n      was reduced to an absolute groping of the way. And now an\n      indescribable uneasiness possessed me—a species of nervous\r\nhesitation and tremor. I feared to tread, lest I should be\n      precipitated into some abyss. I remembered, too, strange stories\n      told about these Ragged Hills, and of the uncouth and fierce\n      races of men who tenanted their groves and caverns. A thousand\n      vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted me—fancies the more\n      distressing because vague. Very suddenly my attention was\n      arrested by the loud beating of a drum.\n\n      “My amazement was, of course, extreme. A drum in these hills was\n      a thing unknown. I could not have been more surprised at the\n      sound of the trump of the Archangel. But a new and still more","astounding source of interest and perplexity arose. There came a\n      wild rattling or jingling sound, as if of a bunch of large keys,\n      and upon the instant a dusky-visaged and half-naked man rushed\n      past me with a shriek. He came so close to my person that I felt\n      his hot breath upon my face. He bore in one hand an instrument\n      composed of an assemblage of steel rings, and shook them\n      vigorously as he ran. Scarcely had he disappeared in the mist\n      before, panting after him, with open mouth and glaring eyes,\n      there darted a huge beast. I could not be mistaken in its\r\ncharacter. It was a hyena.\n\n      “The sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my\n      terrors—for I now made sure that I dreamed, and endeavored to\n      arouse myself to waking consciousness. I stepped boldly and\n      briskly forward. I rubbed my eyes. I called aloud. I pinched my\n      limbs. A small spring of water presented itself to my view, and\n      here, stooping, I bathed my hands and my head and neck. This\n      seemed to dissipate the equivocal sensations which had hitherto\n      annoyed me. I arose, as I thought, a new man, and proceeded\n      steadily and complacently on my unknown way.\r\n“At length, quite overcome by exertion, and by a certain\n      oppressive closeness of the atmosphere, I seated myself beneath a\n      tree. Presently there came a feeble gleam of sunshine, and the\n      shadow of the leaves of the tree fell faintly but definitely upon\n      the grass. At this shadow I gazed wonderingly for many minutes.\n      Its character stupefied me with astonishment. I looked upward.\n      The tree was a palm.\n\n      “I now arose hurriedly, and in a state of fearful agitation—for\n      the fancy that I dreamed would serve me no longer. I saw—I felt","that I had perfect command of my senses—and these senses now\n      brought to my soul a world of novel and singular sensation. The\n      heat became all at once intolerable. A strange odor loaded the\n      breeze. A low, continuous murmur, like that arising from a full,\n      but gently flowing river, came to my ears, intermingled with the\n      peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices.\n\n      “While I listened in an extremity of astonishment which I need\n      not attempt to describe, a strong and brief gust of wind bore off\n      the incumbent fog as if by the wand of an enchanter.\n\n      “I found myself at the foot of a high mountain, and looking down\r\ninto a vast plain, through which wound a majestic river. On the\n      margin of this river stood an Eastern-looking city, such as we\n      read of in the Arabian Tales, but of a character even more\n      singular than any there described. From my position, which was\n      far above the level of the town, I could perceive its every nook\n      and corner, as if delineated on a map. The streets seemed\n      innumerable, and crossed each other irregularly in all\n      directions, but were rather long winding alleys than streets, and\n      absolutely swarmed with inhabitants. The houses were wildly\r\npicturesque. On every hand was a wilderness of balconies, of\n      verandas, of minarets, of shrines, and fantastically carved\n      oriels. Bazaars abounded; and in these were displayed rich wares\n      in infinite variety and profusion—silks, muslins, the most\n      dazzling cutlery, the most magnificent jewels and gems. Besides\n      these things, were seen, on all sides, banners and palanquins,\n      litters with stately dames close-veiled, elephants gorgeously\n      caparisoned, idols grotesquely hewn, drums, banners, and gongs,\n      spears, silver and gilded maces. And amid the crowd, and the","clamor, and the general intricacy and confusion—amid the million\n      of black and yellow men, turbaned and robed, and of flowing\n      beard, there roamed a countless multitude of holy filleted bulls,\n      while vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered,\n      chattering and shrieking, about the cornices of the mosques, or\n      clung to the minarets and oriels. From the swarming streets to\n      the banks of the river, there descended innumerable flights of\n      steps leading to bathing places, while the river itself seemed to\n      force a passage with difficulty through the vast fleets of\r\ndeeply-burthened ships that far and wide encountered its surface.\n      Beyond the limits of the city arose, in frequent majestic groups,\n      the palm and the cocoa, with other gigantic and weird trees of\n      vast age; and here and there might be seen a field of rice, the\n      thatched hut of a peasant, a tank, a stray temple, a gypsy camp,\n      or a solitary graceful maiden taking her way, with a pitcher upon\n      her head, to the banks of the magnificent river.\n\n      “You will say now, of course, that I dreamed; but not so. What I\n      saw—what I heard—what I felt—what I thought—had about it nothing\r\nof the unmistakable idiosyncrasy of the dream. All was rigorously\n      self-consistent. At first, doubting that I was really awake, I\n      entered into a series of tests, which soon convinced me that I\n      really was. Now, when one dreams, and, in the dream, suspects\n      that he dreams, the suspicion never fails to confirm itself, and\n      the sleeper is almost immediately aroused. Thus Novalis errs not\n      in saying that ‘we are near waking when we dream that we dream.’\n      Had the vision occurred to me as I describe it, without my\n      suspecting it as a dream, then a dream it might absolutely have","been, but, occurring as it did, and suspected and tested as it\n      was, I am forced to class it among other phenomena.”\n\n      “In this I am not sure that you are wrong,” observed Dr.\n      Templeton, “but proceed. You arose and descended into the city.”\n\n      “I arose,” continued Bedloe, regarding the Doctor with an air of\n      profound astonishment “I arose, as you say, and descended into\n      the city. On my way I fell in with an immense populace, crowding\n      through every avenue, all in the same direction, and exhibiting\n      in every action the wildest excitement. Very suddenly, and by\n      some inconceivable impulse, I became intensely imbued with\r\npersonal interest in what was going on. I seemed to feel that I\n      had an important part to play, without exactly understanding what\n      it was. Against the crowd which environed me, however, I\n      experienced a deep sentiment of animosity. I shrank from amid\n      them, and, swiftly, by a circuitous path, reached and entered the\n      city. Here all was the wildest tumult and contention. A small\n      party of men, clad in garments half Indian, half European, and\n      officered by gentlemen in a uniform partly British, were engaged,\n      at great odds, with the swarming rabble of the alleys. I joined\r\nthe weaker party, arming myself with the weapons of a fallen\n      officer, and fighting I knew not whom with the nervous ferocity\n      of despair. We were soon overpowered by numbers, and driven to\n      seek refuge in a species of kiosk. Here we barricaded ourselves,\n      and, for the present were secure. From a loop-hole near the\n      summit of the kiosk, I perceived a vast crowd, in furious\n      agitation, surrounding and assaulting a gay palace that overhung\n      the river. Presently, from an upper window of this place, there\n      descended an effeminate-looking person, by means of a string made","of the turbans of his attendants. A boat was at hand, in which he\n      escaped to the opposite bank of the river.\n\n      “And now a new object took possession of my soul. I spoke a few\n      hurried but energetic words to my companions, and, having\n      succeeded in gaining over a few of them to my purpose made a\n      frantic sally from the kiosk. We rushed amid the crowd that\n      surrounded it. They retreated, at first, before us. They rallied,\n      fought madly, and retreated again. In the mean time we were borne\n      far from the kiosk, and became bewildered and entangled among the\r\nnarrow streets of tall, overhanging houses, into the recesses of\n      which the sun had never been able to shine. The rabble pressed\n      impetuously upon us, harrassing us with their spears, and\n      overwhelming us with flights of arrows. These latter were very\n      remarkable, and resembled in some respects the writhing creese of\n      the Malay. They were made to imitate the body of a creeping\n      serpent, and were long and black, with a poisoned barb. One of\n      them struck me upon the right temple. I reeled and fell. An\n      instantaneous and dreadful sickness seized me. I struggled—I\n      gasped—I died.”\r\n“You will hardly persist _now_,” said I smiling, “that the whole\n       of your adventure was not a dream. You are not prepared to\n       maintain that you are dead?”\n\n      When I said these words, I of course expected some lively sally\n      from Bedloe in reply, but, to my astonishment, he hesitated,\n      trembled, became fearfully pallid, and remained silent. I looked\n      toward Templeton. He sat erect and rigid in his chair—his teeth\n      chattered, and his eyes were starting from their sockets.\n      “Proceed!” he at length said hoarsely to Bedloe.\n\n      “For many minutes,” continued the latter, “my sole sentiment—my","sole feeling—was that of darkness and nonentity, with the\n      consciousness of death. At length there seemed to pass a violent\n      and sudden shock through my soul, as if of electricity. With it\n      came the sense of elasticity and of light. This latter I felt—not\n      saw. In an instant I seemed to rise from the ground. But I had no\n      bodily, no visible, audible, or palpable presence. The crowd had\n      departed. The tumult had ceased. The city was in comparative\n      repose. Beneath me lay my corpse, with the arrow in my temple,\n      the whole head greatly swollen and disfigured. But all these\r\nthings I felt—not saw. I took interest in nothing. Even the\n      corpse seemed a matter in which I had no concern. Volition I had\n      none, but appeared to be impelled into motion, and flitted\n      buoyantly out of the city, retracing the circuitous path by which\n      I had entered it. When I had attained that point of the ravine in\n      the mountains at which I had encountered the hyena, I again\n      experienced a shock as of a galvanic battery; the sense of\n      weight, of volition, of substance, returned. I became my original\n      self, and bent my steps eagerly homeward—but the past had not\r\nlost the vividness of the real—and not now, even for an instant,\n      can I compel my understanding to regard it as a dream.”\n\n      “Nor was it,” said Templeton, with an air of deep solemnity, “yet\n      it would be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed.\n      Let us suppose only, that the soul of the man of to-day is upon\n      the verge of some stupendous psychal discoveries. Let us content\n      ourselves with this supposition. For the rest I have some\n      explanation to make. Here is a watercolor drawing, which I should\n      have shown you before, but which an unaccountable sentiment of","horror has hitherto prevented me from showing.”\n\n      We looked at the picture which he presented. I saw nothing in it\n      of an extraordinary character, but its effect upon Bedloe was\n      prodigious. He nearly fainted as he gazed. And yet it was but a\n      miniature portrait—a miraculously accurate one, to be sure—of his\n      own very remarkable features. At least this was my thought as I\n      regarded it.\n\n      “You will perceive,” said Templeton, “the date of this picture—it\n      is here, scarcely visible, in this corner—1780. In this year was\n      the portrait taken. It is the likeness of a dead friend—a Mr.\r\nOldeb—to whom I became much attached at Calcutta, during the\n      administration of Warren Hastings. I was then only twenty years\n      old. When I first saw you, Mr. Bedloe, at Saratoga, it was the\n      miraculous similarity which existed between yourself and the\n      painting which induced me to accost you, to seek your friendship,\n      and to bring about those arrangements which resulted in my\n      becoming your constant companion. In accomplishing this point, I\n      was urged partly, and perhaps principally, by a regretful memory\n      of the deceased, but also, in part, by an uneasy, and not\r\naltogether horrorless curiosity respecting yourself.\n\n      “In your detail of the vision which presented itself to you amid\n      the hills, you have described, with the minutest accuracy, the\n      Indian city of Benares, upon the Holy River. The riots, the\n      combat, the massacre, were the actual events of the insurrection\n      of Cheyte Sing, which took place in 1780, when Hastings was put\n      in imminent peril of his life. The man escaping by the string of\n      turbans was Cheyte Sing himself. The party in the kiosk were\n      sepoys and British officers, headed by Hastings. Of this party I","was one, and did all I could to prevent the rash and fatal sally\n      of the officer who fell, in the crowded alleys, by the poisoned\n      arrow of a Bengalee. That officer was my dearest friend. It was\n      Oldeb. You will perceive by these manuscripts,” (here the speaker\n      produced a note-book in which several pages appeared to have been\n      freshly written,) “that at the very period in which you fancied\n      these things amid the hills, I was engaged in detailing them upon\n      paper here at home.”\n\n      In about a week after this conversation, the following paragraphs\n      appeared in a Charlottesville paper:\r\n“We have the painful duty of announcing the death of Mr. Augustus\n      Bedlo, a gentleman whose amiable manners and many virtues have\n      long endeared him to the citizens of Charlottesville.\n\n      “Mr. B., for some years past, has been subject to neuralgia,\n      which has often threatened to terminate fatally; but this can be\n      regarded only as the mediate cause of his decease. The proximate\n      cause was one of especial singularity. In an excursion to the\n      Ragged Mountains, a few days since, a slight cold and fever were\n      contracted, attended with great determination of blood to the\r\nhead. To relieve this, Dr. Templeton resorted to topical\n      bleeding. Leeches were applied to the temples. In a fearfully\n      brief period the patient died, when it appeared that in the jar\n      containing the leeches, had been introduced, by accident, one of\n      the venomous vermicular sangsues which are now and then found in\n      the neighboring ponds. This creature fastened itself upon a small\n      artery in the right temple. Its close resemblance to the\n      medicinal leech caused the mistake to be overlooked until too\n      late.\n\n      “N. B.—The poisonous sangsue of Charlottesville may always be","distinguished from the medicinal leech by its blackness, and\n      especially by its writhing or vermicular motions, which very\n      nearly resemble those of a snake.”\n\n      I was speaking with the editor of the paper in question, upon the\n      topic of this remarkable accident, when it occurred to me to ask\n      how it happened that the name of the deceased had been given as\n      Bedlo.\n\n      “I presume,” I said, “you have authority for this spelling, but I\n      have always supposed the name to be written with an e at the\n      end.”\n\n      “Authority?—no,” he replied. “It is a mere typographical error.\r\nThe name is Bedlo with an e, all the world over, and I never knew\n      it to be spelt otherwise in my life.”\n\n      “Then,” said I mutteringly, as I turned upon my heel, “then\n      indeed has it come to pass that one truth is stranger than any\n      fiction—for Bedloe, without the e, what is it but Oldeb\n      conversed! And this man tells me that it is a typographical\n      error.”\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPECTACLES\n\n\n      Many years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of “love\n      at first sight;” but those who think, not less than those who\n      feel deeply, have always advocated its existence. Modern\r\ndiscoveries, indeed, in what may be termed ethical magnetism or\n      magnetoesthetics, render it probable that the most natural, and,\n      consequently, the truest and most intense of the human affections\n      are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy—in\n      a word, that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal\n      fetters are those which are riveted by a glance. The confession I\n      am about to make will add another to the already almost\n      innumerable instances of the truth of the position.\n\n      My story requires that I should be somewhat minute. I am still a\n      very young man—not yet twenty-two years of age. My name, at","present, is a very usual and rather plebeian one—Simpson. I say\n      “at present;” for it is only lately that I have been so\n      called—having legislatively adopted this surname within the last\n      year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant\n      male relative, Adolphus Simpson, Esq. The bequest was conditioned\n      upon my taking the name of the testator,—the family, not the\n      Christian name; my Christian name is Napoleon Bonaparte—or, more\n      properly, these are my first and middle appellations.\n\n      I assumed the name, Simpson, with some reluctance, as in my true\r\npatronym, Froissart, I felt a very pardonable pride—believing\n      that I could trace a descent from the immortal author of the\n      “Chronicles.” While on the subject of names, by the bye, I may\n      mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of\n      some of my immediate predecessors. My father was a Monsieur\n      Froissart, of Paris. His wife—my mother, whom he married at\n      fifteen—was a Mademoiselle Croissart, eldest daughter of\n      Croissart the banker, whose wife, again, being only sixteen when\n      married, was the eldest daughter of one Victor Voissart. Monsieur\r\nVoissart, very singularly, had married a lady of similar name—a\n      Mademoiselle Moissart. She, too, was quite a child when married;\n      and her mother, also, Madame Moissart, was only fourteen when led\n      to the altar. These early marriages are usual in France. Here,\n      however, are Moissart, Voissart, Croissart, and Froissart, all in\n      the direct line of descent. My own name, though, as I say, became\n      Simpson, by act of Legislature, and with so much repugnance on my\n      part, that, at one period, I actually hesitated about accepting\n      the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached.","As to personal endowments, I am by no means deficient. On the\n      contrary, I believe that I am well made, and possess what nine\n      tenths of the world would call a handsome face. In height I am\n      five feet eleven. My hair is black and curling. My nose is\n      sufficiently good. My eyes are large and gray; and although, in\n      fact they are weak to a very inconvenient degree, still no defect\n      in this regard would be suspected from their appearance. The\n      weakness itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and I have\n      resorted to every remedy—short of wearing glasses. Being youthful\r\nand good-looking, I naturally dislike these, and have resolutely\n      refused to employ them. I know nothing, indeed, which so\n      disfigures the countenance of a young person, or so impresses\n      every feature with an air of demureness, if not altogether of\n      sanctimoniousness and of age. An eyeglass, on the other hand, has\n      a savor of downright foppery and affectation. I have hitherto\n      managed as well as I could without either. But something too much\n      of these merely personal details, which, after all, are of little\n      importance. I will content myself with saying, in addition, that\r\nmy temperament is sanguine, rash, ardent, enthusiastic—and that\n      all my life I have been a devoted admirer of the women.\n\n      One night last winter I entered a box at the P—— Theatre, in\n      company with a friend, Mr. Talbot. It was an opera night, and the\n      bills presented a very rare attraction, so that the house was\n      excessively crowded. We were in time, however, to obtain the\n      front seats which had been reserved for us, and into which, with\n      some little difficulty, we elbowed our way.\n\n      For two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave his","undivided attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, I amused\n      myself by observing the audience, which consisted, in chief part,\n      of the very elite of the city. Having satisfied myself upon this\n      point, I was about turning my eyes to the prima donna, when they\n      were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes\n      which had escaped my observation.\n\n      If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the intense\n      emotion with which I regarded this figure. It was that of a\n      female, the most exquisite I had ever beheld. The face was so far\n      turned toward the stage that, for some minutes, I could not\r\nobtain a view of it—but the form was divine; no other word can\n      sufficiently express its magnificent proportion—and even the term\n      “divine” seems ridiculously feeble as I write it.\n\n      The magic of a lovely form in woman—the necromancy of female\n      gracefulness—was always a power which I had found it impossible\n      to resist, but here was grace personified, incarnate, the beau\n      ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions. The figure,\n      almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be\n      seen, was somewhat above the medium height, and nearly\r\napproached, without positively reaching, the majestic. Its\n      perfect fullness and tournure were delicious. The head, of which\n      only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that of the Greek\n      Psyche, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap\n      of _gaze äérienne_, which put me in mind of the _ventum textilem_\n      of Apuleius. The right arm hung over the balustrade of the box,\n      and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry.\n      Its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves\n      now in fashion. This extended but little below the elbow. Beneath","it was worn an under one of some frail material, close-fitting,\n      and terminated by a cuff of rich lace, which fell gracefully over\n      the top of the hand, revealing only the delicate fingers, upon\n      one of which sparkled a diamond ring, which I at once saw was of\n      extraordinary value. The admirable roundness of the wrist was\n      well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and which also was\n      ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of\n      jewels—telling, in words that could not be mistaken, at once of\n      the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer.\r\nI gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour, as\n      if I had been suddenly converted to stone; and, during this\n      period, I felt the full force and truth of all that has been said\n      or sung concerning “love at first sight.” My feelings were\n      totally different from any which I had hitherto experienced, in\n      the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female\n      loveliness. An unaccountable, and what I am compelled to consider\n      a magnetic, sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, not only\n      my vision, but my whole powers of thought and feeling, upon the\r\nadmirable object before me. I saw—I felt—I knew that I was\n      deeply, madly, irrevocably in love—and this even before seeing\n      the face of the person beloved. So intense, indeed, was the\n      passion that consumed me, that I really believe it would have\n      received little if any abatement had the features, yet unseen,\n      proved of merely ordinary character; so anomalous is the nature\n      of the only true love—of the love at first sight—and so little\n      really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only\n      seem to create and control it.\n\n      While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision, a","sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head\n      partially toward me, so that I beheld the entire profile of the\n      face. Its beauty even exceeded my anticipations—and yet there was\n      something about it which disappointed me without my being able to\n      tell exactly what it was. I said “disappointed,” but this is not\n      altogether the word. My sentiments were at once quieted and\n      exalted. They partook less of transport and more of calm\n      enthusiasm—of enthusiastic repose. This state of feeling arose,\n      perhaps, from the Madonna-like and matronly air of the face; and\r\nyet I at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely\n      from this. There was something else—some mystery which I could\n      not develope—some expression about the countenance which slightly\n      disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest. In fact, I\n      was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and\n      susceptible man for any act of extravagance. Had the lady been\n      alone, I should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her\n      at all hazards; but, fortunately, she was attended by two\n      companions—a gentleman, and a strikingly beautiful woman, to all\r\nappearance a few years younger than herself.\n\n      I revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which I might obtain,\n      hereafter, an introduction to the elder lady, or, for the\n      present, at all events, a more distinct view of her beauty. I\n      would have removed my position to one nearer her own, but the\n      crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible; and the\n      stern decrees of Fashion had, of late, imperatively prohibited\n      the use of the opera-glass in a case such as this, even had I\n      been so fortunate as to have one with me—but I had not—and was\n      thus in despair.","At length I bethought me of applying to my companion.\n\n      “Talbot,” I said, “you have an opera-glass. Let me have it.”\n\n      “An opera-glass!—no!—what do you suppose I would be doing with an\n      opera-glass?” Here he turned impatiently toward the stage.\n\n      “But, Talbot,” I continued, pulling him by the shoulder, “listen\n      to me will you? Do you see the stage-box?—there!—no, the next.—\n      Did you ever behold as lovely a woman?”\n\n      “She is very beautiful, no doubt,” he said.\n\n      “I wonder who she can be?”\n\n      “Why, in the name of all that is angelic, don’t you know who she\r\nis? ‘Not to know her argues yourself unknown.’ She is the\n      celebrated Madame Lalande—the beauty of the day par excellence,\n      and the talk of the whole town. Immensely wealthy too—a widow,\n      and a great match—has just arrived from Paris.”\n\n      “Do you know her?”\n\n      “Yes; I have the honor.”\n\n      “Will you introduce me?”\n\n      “Assuredly, with the greatest pleasure; when shall it be?”\n\n      “To-morrow, at one, I will call upon you at B—’s.”\n\n      “Very good; and now do hold your tongue, if you can.”\n\n      In this latter respect I was forced to take Talbot’s advice; for\n      he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or\r\nsuggestion, and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the\n      evening with what was transacting upon the stage.\n\n      In the meantime I kept my eyes riveted on Madame Lalande, and at\n      length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her\n      face. It was exquisitely lovely—this, of course, my heart had\n      told me before, even had not Talbot fully satisfied me upon the\n      point—but still the unintelligible something disturbed me. I\n      finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air\n      of gravity, sadness, or, still more properly, of weariness, which","took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance,\n      only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty, and\n      thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment, with\n      an interest tenfold.\n\n      While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to my great\n      trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the\n      lady, that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my\n      gaze. Still, I was absolutely fascinated, and could not withdraw\n      it, even for an instant. She turned aside her face, and again I\r\nsaw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head.\n      After some minutes, as if urged by curiosity to see if I was\n      still looking, she gradually brought her face again around and\n      again encountered my burning gaze. Her large dark eyes fell\n      instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek. But what was my\n      astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second\n      time avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a\n      double eyeglass—elevated it—adjusted it—and then regarded me\n      through it, intently and deliberately, for the space of several\n      minutes.\r\nHad a thunderbolt fallen at my feet I could not have been more\n      thoroughly astounded—astounded only—not offended or disgusted in\n      the slightest degree; although an action so bold in any other\n      woman would have been likely to offend or disgust. But the whole\n      thing was done with so much quietude—so much nonchalance—so much\n      repose—with so evident an air of the highest breeding, in\n      short—that nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible, and my\n      sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise.\n\n      I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass, she had\n      seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, and","was withdrawing the instrument, when, as if struck by a second\n      thought, she resumed it, and so continued to regard me with fixed\n      attention for the space of several minutes—for five minutes, at\n      the very least, I am sure.\n\n      This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted very\n      general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or\n      buzz, among the audience, which for a moment filled me with\n      confusion, but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of\n      Madame Lalande.\n\n      Having satisfied her curiosity—if such it was—she dropped the\r\nglass, and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her\n      profile now being turned toward myself, as before. I continued to\n      watch her unremittingly, although I was fully conscious of my\n      rudeness in so doing. Presently I saw the head slowly and\n      slightly change its position; and soon I became convinced that\n      the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact,\n      attentively regarding myself. It is needless to say what effect\n      this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my\n      excitable mind.\n\n      Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, the\r\nfair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended\n      her, and while she spoke, I saw distinctly, by the glances of\n      both, that the conversation had reference to myself.\n\n      Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned toward the\n      stage, and, for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the\n      performance. At the expiration of this period, however, I was\n      thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold, for\n      the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her side, fully\n      confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz of the","audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous\n      composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my\n      soul.\n\n      This extraordinary behavior, by throwing me into a perfect fever\n      of excitement—into an absolute delirium of love—served rather to\n      embolden than to disconcert me. In the mad intensity of my\n      devotion, I forgot everything but the presence and the majestic\n      loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze. Watching my\n      opportunity, when I thought the audience were fully engaged with\n      the opera, I at length caught the eyes of Madame Lalande, and,\r\nupon the instant, made a slight but unmistakable bow.\n\n      She blushed very deeply—then averted her eyes—then slowly and\n      cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action had\n      been noticed—then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her\n      side.\n\n      I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had committed,\n      and expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision\n      of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably\n      through my brain. I was greatly and immediately relieved,\n      however, when I saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a\r\nplay-bill, without speaking; but the reader may form some feeble\n      conception of my astonishment—of my profound amazement—my\n      delirious bewilderment of heart and soul—when, instantly\n      afterward, having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her\n      bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with\n      a faint smile, disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth, made\n      two distinct, pointed, and unequivocal affirmative inclinations\n      of the head.\n\n      It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy—upon my\n      transport—upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart. If ever man was","mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at that moment. I\n      loved. This was my first love—so I felt it to be. It was love\n      supreme—indescribable. It was “love at first sight;” and at first\n      sight, too, it had been appreciated and returned.\n\n      Yes, returned. How and why should I doubt it for an instant. What\n      other construction could I possibly put upon such conduct, on the\n      part of a lady so beautiful—so wealthy—evidently so\n      accomplished—of so high breeding—of so lofty a position in\n      society—in every regard so entirely respectable as I felt assured\r\nwas Madame Lalande? Yes, she loved me—she returned the enthusiasm\n      of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind—as uncompromising—as\n      uncalculating—as abandoned—and as utterly unbounded as my own!\n      These delicious fancies and reflections, however, were now\n      interrupted by the falling of the drop-curtain. The audience\n      arose; and the usual tumult immediately supervened. Quitting\n      Talbot abruptly, I made every effort to force my way into closer\n      proximity with Madame Lalande. Having failed in this, on account\n      of the crowd, I at length gave up the chase, and bent my steps\r\nhomeward; consoling myself for my disappointment in not having\n      been able to touch even the hem of her robe, by the reflection\n      that I should be introduced by Talbot, in due form, upon the\n      morrow.\n\n      This morrow at last came, that is to say, a day finally dawned\n      upon a long and weary night of impatience; and then the hours\n      until “one” were snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable. But even\n      Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and there came an end to\n      this long delay. The clock struck. As the last echo ceased, I\n      stepped into B——’s and inquired for Talbot.\n\n      “Out,” said the footman—Talbot’s own.","“Out!” I replied, staggering back half a dozen paces—“let me tell\n      you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly impossible and\n      impracticable; Mr. Talbot is not out. What do you mean?”\n\n      “Nothing, sir; only Mr. Talbot is not in, that’s all. He rode\n      over to S——, immediately after breakfast, and left word that he\n      would not be in town again for a week.”\n\n      I stood petrified with horror and rage. I endeavored to reply,\n      but my tongue refused its office. At length I turned on my heel,\n      livid with wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the\r\nTalbots to the innermost regions of Erebus. It was evident that\n      my considerate friend, il fanatico, had quite forgotten his\n      appointment with myself—had forgotten it as soon as it was made.\n      At no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word. There was no\n      help for it; so smothering my vexation as well as I could, I\n      strolled moodily up the street, propounding futile inquiries\n      about Madame Lalande to every male acquaintance I met. By report\n      she was known, I found, to all—to many by sight—but she had been\n      in town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who\r\nclaimed her personal acquaintance. These few, being still\n      comparatively strangers, could not, or would not, take the\n      liberty of introducing me through the formality of a morning\n      call. While I stood thus in despair, conversing with a trio of\n      friends upon the all-absorbing subject of my heart, it so\n      happened that the subject itself passed by.\n\n      “As I live, there she is!” cried one.\n\n      “Surprisingly beautiful!” exclaimed a second.\n\n      “An angel upon earth!” ejaculated a third.\n\n      I looked; and in an open carriage which approached us, passing","slowly down the street, sat the enchanting vision of the opera,\n      accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her\n      box.\n\n      “Her companion also wears remarkably well,” said the one of my\n      trio who had spoken first.\n\n      “Astonishingly,” said the second; “still quite a brilliant air,\n      but art will do wonders. Upon my word, she looks better than she\n      did at Paris five years ago. A beautiful woman still;—don’t you\n      think so, Froissart?—Simpson, I mean.”\n\n      “_Still!_” said I, “and why shouldn’t she be? But compared with\n      her friend she is as a rush-light to the evening star—a glow-worm\r\nto Antares.”\n\n      “Ha! ha! ha!—why, Simpson, you have an astonishing tact at making\n      discoveries—original ones, I mean.” And here we separated, while\n      one of the trio began humming a gay _vaudeville_, of which I\n      caught only the lines—\n\n      Ninon, Ninon, Ninon à bas—\n      A bas Ninon De L’Enclos!\n\n      During this little scene, however, one thing had served greatly\n      to console me, although it fed the passion by which I was\n      consumed. As the carriage of Madame Lalande rolled by our group,\n      I had observed that she recognized me; and more than this, she\n      had blessed me, by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles,\r\nwith no equivocal mark of the recognition.\n\n      As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all hope of it\n      until such time as Talbot should think proper to return from the\n      country. In the meantime I perseveringly frequented every\n      reputable place of public amusement; and, at length, at the\n      theatre, where I first saw her, I had the supreme bliss of\n      meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her once again. This\n      did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight. Every\n      day, in the interim, I had inquired for Talbot at his hotel, and","every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the\n      everlasting “Not come home yet” of his footman.\n\n      Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a condition\n      little short of madness. Madame Lalande, I had been told, was a\n      Parisian—had lately arrived from Paris—might she not suddenly\n      return?—return before Talbot came back—and might she not be thus\n      lost to me forever? The thought was too terrible to bear. Since\n      my future happiness was at issue, I resolved to act with a manly\n      decision. In a word, upon the breaking up of the play, I traced\r\nthe lady to her residence, noted the address, and the next\n      morning sent her a full and elaborate letter, in which I poured\n      out my whole heart.\n\n      I spoke boldly, freely—in a word, I spoke with passion. I\n      concealed nothing—nothing even of my weakness. I alluded to the\n      romantic circumstances of our first meeting—even to the glances\n      which had passed between us. I went so far as to say that I felt\n      assured of her love; while I offered this assurance, and my own\n      intensity of devotion, as two excuses for my otherwise\n      unpardonable conduct. As a third, I spoke of my fear that she\r\nmight quit the city before I could have the opportunity of a\n      formal introduction. I concluded the most wildly enthusiastic\n      epistle ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly\n      circumstances—of my affluence—and with an offer of my heart and\n      of my hand.\n\n      In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply. After what seemed\n      the lapse of a century it came.\n\n      Yes, actually came. Romantic as all this may appear, I really\n      received a letter from Madame Lalande—the beautiful, the wealthy,\n      the idolized Madame Lalande. Her eyes—her magnificent eyes, had","not belied her noble heart. Like a true Frenchwoman as she was\n      she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reason—the generous\n      impulses of her nature—despising the conventional pruderies of\n      the world. She had not scorned my proposals. She had not\n      sheltered herself in silence. She had not returned my letter\n      unopened. She had even sent me, in reply, one penned by her own\n      exquisite fingers. It ran thus:\n\n      “Monsieur Simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle\n      tong of his contrée so vell as might. It is only de late dat I am\n      arrive, and not yet ave do opportunité for to—l’étudier.\r\n“Vid dis apologie for the manière, I vill now say dat,\n      hélas!—Monsieur Simpson ave guess but de too true. Need I say de\n      more? Hélas! am I not ready speak de too moshe?\n\n      “EUGENIE LALAND.”\n\n      This noble-spirited note I kissed a million times, and committed,\n      no doubt, on its account, a thousand other extravagances that\n      have now escaped my memory. Still Talbot _would_ not return.\n      Alas! could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering\n      his absence had occasioned his friend, would not his sympathizing\n      nature have flown immediately to my relief? Still, however, he\r\ncame _not_. I wrote. He replied. He was detained by urgent\n      business—but would shortly return. He begged me not to be\n      impatient—to moderate my transports—to read soothing books—to\n      drink nothing stronger than Hock—and to bring the consolations of\n      philosophy to my aid. The fool! if he could not come himself,\n      why, in the name of every thing rational, could he not have\n      enclosed me a letter of presentation? I wrote him again,\n      entreating him to forward one forthwith. My letter was returned\n      by _that_ footman, with the following endorsement in pencil. The","scoundrel had joined his master in the country:\n\n      “Left S—— yesterday, for parts unknown—did not say where—or when\n      be back—so thought best to return letter, knowing your\n      handwriting, and as how you is always, more or less, in a hurry.\n\n      “Yours sincerely,\n\n      “STUBBS.”\n\n      After this, it is needless to say, that I devoted to the infernal\n      deities both master and valet:—but there was little use in anger,\n      and no consolation at all in complaint.\n\n      But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional audacity.\n      Hitherto it had served me well, and I now resolved to make it\r\navail me to the end. Besides, after the correspondence which had\n      passed between us, what act of mere informality could I commit,\n      within bounds, that ought to be regarded as indecorous by Madame\n      Lalande? Since the affair of the letter, I had been in the habit\n      of watching her house, and thus discovered that, about twilight,\n      it was her custom to promenade, attended only by a negro in\n      livery, in a public square overlooked by her windows. Here, amid\n      the luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the gray gloom of a sweet\n      midsummer evening, I observed my opportunity and accosted her.\r\nThe better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did this with\n      the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance. With a\n      presence of mind truly Parisian, she took the cue at once, and,\n      to greet me, held out the most bewitchingly little of hands. The\n      valet at once fell into the rear, and now, with hearts full to\n      overflowing, we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love.\n\n      As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently than she wrote\n      it, our conversation was necessarily in French. In this sweet\n      tongue, so adapted to passion, I gave loose to the impetuous","enthusiasm of my nature, and, with all the eloquence I could\n      command, besought her to consent to an immediate marriage.\n\n      At this impatience she smiled. She urged the old story of\n      decorum—that bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the\n      opportunity for bliss has forever gone by. I had most imprudently\n      made it known among my friends, she observed, that I desired her\n      acquaintance—thus that I did not possess it—thus, again, there\n      was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge\n      of each other. And then she adverted, with a blush, to the\r\nextreme recency of this date. To wed immediately would be\n      improper—would be indecorous—would be outre. All this she said\n      with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved\n      and convinced me. She went even so far as to accuse me,\n      laughingly, of rashness—of imprudence. She bade me remember that\n      I really even knew not who she was—what were her prospects, her\n      connections, her standing in society. She begged me, but with a\n      sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my love an\n      infatuation—a will o’ the wisp—a fancy or fantasy of the moment—a\r\nbaseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of\n      the heart. These things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet\n      twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us—and then, with\n      a gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single\n      sweet instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared.\n\n      I replied as best I could—as only a true lover can. I spoke at\n      length, and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion—of her\n      exceeding beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration. In\n      conclusion, I dwelt, with a convincing energy, upon the perils","that encompass the course of love—that course of true love that\n      never did run smooth—and thus deduced the manifest danger of\n      rendering that course unnecessarily long.\n\n      This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her\n      determination. She relented; but there was yet an obstacle, she\n      said, which she felt assured I had not properly considered. This\n      was a delicate point—for a woman to urge, especially so; in\n      mentioning it, she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her\n      feelings; still, for me, every sacrifice should be made. She\n      alluded to the topic of age. Was I aware—was I fully aware of the\r\ndiscrepancy between us? That the age of the husband, should\n      surpass by a few years—even by fifteen or twenty—the age of the\n      wife, was regarded by the world as admissible, and, indeed, as\n      even proper; but she had always entertained the belief that the\n      years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the\n      husband. A discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too\n      frequently, alas! to a life of unhappiness. Now she was aware\n      that my own age did not exceed two and twenty; and I, on the\n      contrary, perhaps, was not aware that the years of my Eugénie\r\nextended very considerably beyond that sum.\n\n      About all this there was a nobility of soul—a dignity of\n      candor—which delighted—which enchanted me—which eternally riveted\n      my chains. I could scarcely restrain the excessive transport\n      which possessed me.\n\n      “My sweetest Eugénie,” I cried, “what is all this about which you\n      are discoursing? Your years surpass in some measure my own. But\n      what then? The customs of the world are so many conventional\n      follies. To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs\n      a year from an hour? I am twenty-two, you say; granted: indeed,","you may as well call me, at once, twenty-three. Now you yourself,\n      my dearest Eugénie, can have numbered no more than—can have\n      numbered no more than—no more than—than—than—than—”\n\n      Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that Madame\n      Lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age. But a\n      Frenchwoman is seldom direct, and has always, by way of answer to\n      an embarrassing query, some little practical reply of her own. In\n      the present instance, Eugénie, who for a few moments past had\n      seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at length let\r\nfall upon the grass a miniature, which I immediately picked up\n      and presented to her.\n\n      “Keep it!” she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles. “Keep\n      it for my sake—for the sake of her whom it too flatteringly\n      represents. Besides, upon the back of the trinket you may\n      discover, perhaps, the very information you seem to desire. It is\n      now, to be sure, growing rather dark—but you can examine it at\n      your leisure in the morning. In the meantime, you shall be my\n      escort home to-night. My friends are about holding a little\n      musical _levée_. I can promise you, too, some good singing. We\r\nFrench are not nearly so punctilious as you Americans, and I\n      shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the character of\n      an old acquaintance.”\n\n      With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home. The mansion\n      was quite a fine one, and, I believe, furnished in good taste. Of\n      this latter point, however, I am scarcely qualified to judge; for\n      it was just dark as we arrived; and in American mansions of the\n      better sort lights seldom, during the heat of summer, make their\n      appearance at this, the most pleasant period of the day. In about","an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a single shaded solar lamp\n      was lit in the principal drawing-room; and this apartment, I\n      could thus see, was arranged with unusual good taste and even\n      splendor; but two other rooms of the suite, and in which the\n      company chiefly assembled, remained, during the whole evening, in\n      a very agreeable shadow. This is a well-conceived custom, giving\n      the party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which our\n      friends over the water could not do better than immediately\n      adopt.\n\n      The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of\r\nmy life. Madame Lalande had not overrated the musical abilities\n      of her friends; and the singing I here heard I had never heard\n      excelled in any private circle out of Vienna. The instrumental\n      performers were many and of superior talents. The vocalists were\n      chiefly ladies, and no individual sang less than well. At length,\n      upon a peremptory call for “Madame Lalande,” she arose at once,\n      without affectation or demur, from the chaise longue upon which\n      she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by one or two gentlemen\n      and her female friend of the opera, repaired to the piano in the\r\nmain drawing-room. I would have escorted her myself, but felt\n      that, under the circumstances of my introduction to the house, I\n      had better remain unobserved where I was. I was thus deprived of\n      the pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing, her sing.\n\n      The impression she produced upon the company seemed\n      electrical—but the effect upon myself was something even more. I\n      know not how adequately to describe it. It arose in part, no\n      doubt, from the sentiment of love with which I was imbued; but\n      chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the","singer. It is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or\n      recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers. Her\n      utterance of the romance in Otello—the tone with which she gave\n      the words “Sul mio sasso,” in the Capuletti—is ringing in my\n      memory yet. Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous. Her voice\n      embraced three complete octaves, extending from the contralto D\n      to the D upper soprano, and, though sufficiently powerful to have\n      filled the San Carlos, executed, with the minutest precision,\n      every difficulty of vocal composition—ascending and descending\r\nscales, cadences, or fiorituri. In the final of the Somnambula,\n      she brought about a most remarkable effect at the words:\n\n     Ah! non guinge uman pensiero\n     Al contento ond ’io son piena.\n\n      Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original phrase\n      of Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to the tenor G, when,\n      by a rapid transition, she struck the G above the treble stave,\n      springing over an interval of two octaves.\n\n      Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal\n      execution, she resumed her seat by my side; when I expressed to\r\nher, in terms of the deepest enthusiasm, my delight at her\n      performance. Of my surprise I said nothing, and yet was I most\n      unfeignedly surprised; for a certain feebleness, or rather a\n      certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation,\n      had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing, she would not\n      acquit herself with any remarkable ability.\n\n      Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and\n      totally unreserved. She made me relate many of the earlier\n      passages of my life, and listened with breathless attention to\n      every word of the narrative. I concealed nothing—felt that I had","a right to conceal nothing—from her confiding affection.\n      Encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age, I\n      entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of my\n      many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and\n      even of those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in\n      demanding so much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an\n      evidence of love. I touched upon my college indiscretions—upon my\n      extravagances—upon my carousals—upon my debts—upon my\n      flirtations. I even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic\r\ncough with which, at one time, I had been troubled—of a chronic\n      rheumatism—of a twinge of hereditary gout—and, in conclusion, of\n      the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully\n      concealed, weakness of my eyes.\n\n      “Upon this latter point,” said Madame Lalande, laughingly, “you\n      have been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for,\n      without the confession, I take it for granted that no one would\n      have accused you of the crime. By the by,” she continued, “have\n      you any recollection—” and here I fancied that a blush, even\n      through the gloom of the apartment, became distinctly visible\r\nupon her cheek—“have you any recollection, _mon cher ami_, of\n      this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my neck?”\n\n      As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double\n      eye-glass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the\n      opera.\n\n      “Full well—alas! do I remember it,” I exclaimed, pressing\n      passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my\n      inspection. They formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly\n      chased and filigreed, and gleaming with jewels, which, even in\n      the deficient light, I could not help perceiving were of high","value.\n\n      “_Eh bien! mon ami_,” she resumed with a certain _empressment_ of\n      manner that rather surprised me—“_Eh bien! mon ami_, you have\n      earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to\n      denominate priceless. You have demanded of me my hand upon the\n      morrow. Should I yield to your entreaties—and, I may add, to the\n      pleadings of my own bosom—would I not be entitled to demand of\n      you a very—a very little boon in return?”\n\n      “Name it!” I exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon\n      us the observation of the company, and restrained by their\r\npresence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet.\n      “Name it, my beloved, my Eugénie, my own!—name it!—but, alas! it\n      is already yielded ere named.”\n\n      “You shall conquer, then, _mon ami_,” said she, “for the sake of\n      the Eugénie whom you love, this little weakness which you have at\n      last confessed—this weakness more moral than physical—and which,\n      let me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your real\n      nature—so inconsistent with the candor of your usual\n      character—and which, if permitted further control, will assuredly\n      involve you, sooner or later, in some very disagreeable scrape.\r\nYou shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation which leads you,\n      as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied denial of\n      your infirmity of vision. For, this infirmity you virtually deny,\n      in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief. You\n      will understand me to say, then, that I wish you to wear\n      spectacles;—ah, hush!—you have already consented to wear them,\n      for my sake. You shall accept the little toy which I now hold in\n      my hand, and which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is\n      really of no very immense value as a gem. You perceive that, by a","trifling modification thus—or thus—it can be adapted to the eyes\n      in the form of spectacles, or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an\n      eye-glass. It is in the former mode, however, and habitually,\n      that you have already consented to wear it for my sake.”\n\n      This request—must I confess it?—confused me in no little degree.\n      But the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation,\n      of course, a matter altogether out of the question.\n\n      “It is done!” I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I could\n      muster at the moment. “It is done—it is most cheerfully agreed. I\r\nsacrifice every feeling for your sake. To-night I wear this dear\n      eye-glass, as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the\n      earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of\n      calling you wife, I will place it upon my—upon my nose,—and there\n      wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less\n      fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which\n      you desire.”\n\n      Our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements\n      for the morrow. Talbot, I learned from my betrothed, had just\n      arrived in town. I was to see him at once, and procure a\r\ncarriage. The _soirée_ would scarcely break up before two; and by\n      this hour the vehicle was to be at the door; when, in the\n      confusion occasioned by the departure of the company, Madame L.\n      could easily enter it unobserved. We were then to call at the\n      house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be married,\n      drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East; leaving the\n      fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the\n      matter it thought best.\n\n      Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and went in\n      search of Talbot, but, on the way, I could not refrain from","stepping into a hotel, for the purpose of inspecting the\n      miniature; and this I did by the powerful aid of the glasses. The\n      countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one! Those large\n      luminous eyes!—that proud Grecian nose!—those dark luxuriant\n      curls!—“Ah!” said I, exultingly to myself, “this is indeed the\n      speaking image of my beloved!” I turned the reverse, and\n      discovered the words—“Eugénie Lalande—aged twenty-seven years and\n      seven months.”\n\n      I found Talbot at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint him\n      with my good fortune. He professed excessive astonishment, of\r\ncourse, but congratulated me most cordially, and proffered every\n      assistance in his power. In a word, we carried out our\n      arrangement to the letter, and, at two in the morning, just ten\n      minutes after the ceremony, I found myself in a close carriage\n      with Madame Lalande—with Mrs. Simpson, I should say—and driving\n      at a great rate out of town, in a direction northeast by north,\n      half-north.\n\n      It had been determined for us by Talbot, that, as we were to be\n      up all night, we should make our first stop at C——, a village\n      about twenty miles from the city, and there get an early\r\nbreakfast and some repose, before proceeding upon our route. At\n      four precisely, therefore, the carriage drew up at the door of\n      the principal inn. I handed my adored wife out, and ordered\n      breakfast forthwith. In the meantime we were shown into a small\n      parlor, and sat down.\n\n      It was now nearly if not altogether daylight; and, as I gazed,\n      enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular idea came, all\n      at once, into my head, that this was really the very first moment\n      since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of Madame\n      Lalande, that I had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness","by daylight at all.\n\n      “And now, _mon ami_,” said she, taking my hand, and so\n      interrupting this train of reflection, “and now, _mon cher ami_,\n      since we are indissolubly one—since I have yielded to your\n      passionate entreaties, and performed my portion of our\n      agreement—I presume you have not forgotten that you also have a\n      little favor to bestow—a little promise which it is your\n      intention to keep. Ah! let me see! Let me remember! Yes; full\n      easily do I call to mind the precise words of the dear promise\n      you made to Eugénie last night. Listen! You spoke thus: ‘It is\r\ndone!—it is most cheerfully agreed! I sacrifice every feeling for\n      your sake. To-night I wear this dear eye-glass as an eye-glass,\n      and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning\n      which gives me the privilege of calling you wife, I will place it\n      upon my—upon my nose,—and there wear it ever afterward, in the\n      less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more\n      serviceable, form which you desire.’ These were the exact words,\n      my beloved husband, were they not?”\n\n      “They were,” I said; “you have an excellent memory; and\r\nassuredly, my beautiful Eugénie, there is no disposition on my\n      part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply.\n      See! Behold! they are becoming—rather—are they not?” And here,\n      having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles, I\n      applied them gingerly in their proper position; while Madame\n      Simpson, adjusting her cap, and folding her arms, sat bolt\n      upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim, and indeed,\n      in a somewhat undignified position.\n\n      “Goodness gracious me!” I exclaimed, almost at the very instant\n      that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nose—“_My!_","goodness gracious me!—why, what can be the matter with these\n      glasses?” and taking them quickly off, I wiped them carefully\n      with a silk handkerchief, and adjusted them again.\n\n      But if, in the first instance, there had occurred something which\n      occasioned me surprise, in the second, this surprise became\n      elevated into astonishment; and this astonishment was\n      profound—was extreme—indeed I may say it was horrific. What, in\n      the name of everything hideous, did this mean? Could I believe my\n      eyes?—could I?—that was the question. Was that—was that—was that\r\nrouge? And were those—and were those—were those wrinkles, upon\n      the visage of Eugénie Lalande? And oh! Jupiter, and every one of\n      the gods and goddesses, little and big!—what—what—what—_what_ had\n      become of her teeth? I dashed the spectacles violently to the\n      ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood erect in the middle of the\n      floor, confronting Mrs. Simpson, with my arms set a-kimbo, and\n      grinning and foaming, but, at the same time, utterly speechless\n      with terror and with rage.\n\n      Now I have already said that Madame Eugénie Lalande—that is to\r\nsay, Simpson—spoke the English language but very little better\n      than she wrote it, and for this reason she very properly never\n      attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions. But rage will\n      carry a lady to any extreme; and in the present care it carried\n      Mrs. Simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to\n      hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether\n      understand.\n\n      “Vell, Monsieur,” said she, after surveying me, in great apparent\n      astonishment, for some moments—“Vell, Monsieur?—and vat den?—vat\n      de matter now? Is it de dance of de Saint itusse dat you ave? If","not like me, vat for vy buy de pig in the poke?”\n\n      “You wretch!” said I, catching my breath—“you—you—you villainous\n      old hag!”\n\n      “Ag?—ole?—me not so ver ole, after all! Me not one single day\n      more dan de eighty-doo.”\n\n      “Eighty-two!” I ejaculated, staggering to the wall—“eighty-two\n      hundred thousand baboons! The miniature said twenty-seven years\n      and seven months!”\n\n      “To be sure!—dat is so!—ver true! but den de portraite has been\n      take for dese fifty-five year. Ven I go marry my segonde usbande,\n      Monsieur Lalande, at dat time I had de portraite take for my\r\ndaughter by my first usbande, Monsieur Moissart!”\n\n      “Moissart!” said I.\n\n      “Yes, Moissart,” said she, mimicking my pronunciation, which, to\n      speak the truth, was none of the best,—“and vat den? Vat you know\n      about de Moissart?”\n\n      “Nothing, you old fright!—I know nothing about him at all; only I\n      had an ancestor of that name, once upon a time.”\n\n      “Dat name! and vat you ave for say to dat name? ’Tis ver _goot_\n      name; and so is Voissart—dat is ver goot name too. My daughter,\n      Mademoiselle Moissart, she marry von Monsieur Voissart,—and de\n      name is bot _ver_ respectable name.”\r\n“Moissart?” I exclaimed, “and Voissart! Why, what is it you\n      mean?”\n\n      “Vat I mean?—I mean Moissart and Voissart; and for de matter of\n      dat, I mean Croissart and Froissart, too, if I only tink proper\n      to mean it. My daughter’s daughter, Mademoiselle Voissart, she\n      marry von Monsieur Croissart, and den again, my daughter’s grande\n      daughter, Mademoiselle Croissart, she marry von Monsieur\n      Froissart; and I suppose you say dat _dat_ is not von _ver_\n      respectaable name.”\n\n      “Froissart!” said I, beginning to faint, “why, surely you don’t\n      say Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart?”","“Yes,” she replied, leaning fully back in her chair, and\n      stretching out her lower limbs at great length; “yes, Moissart,\n      and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart. But Monsieur\n      Froissart, he vas von _ver_ big vat you call fool—he vas von ver\n      great big donce like yourself—for he lef _la belle France_ for\n      come to dis stupide Amérique—and ven he get here he went and ave\n      von _ver_ stupid, von _ver, ver_ stupide sonn, so I hear, dough I\n      not yet av ad de plaisir to meet vid him—neither me nor my\n      companion, de Madame Stéphanie Lalande. He is name de Napoleon\r\nBonaparte Froissart, and I suppose you say dat _dat_, too, is not\n      von ver respectable name.”\n\n      Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the effect of\n      working up Mrs. Simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed;\n      and as she made an end of it, with great labor, she jumped up\n      from her chair like somebody bewitched, dropping upon the floor\n      an entire universe of bustle as she jumped. Once upon her feet,\n      she gnashed her gums, brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves,\n      shook her fist in my face, and concluded the performance by\r\ntearing the cap from her head, and with it an immense wig of the\n      most valuable and beautiful black hair, the whole of which she\n      dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there trammpled and\n      danced a fandango upon it, in an absolute ecstasy and agony of\n      rage.\n\n      Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated.\n      “Moissart and Voissart!” I repeated, thoughtfully, as she cut one\n      of her pigeon-wings, and “Croissart and Froissart!” as she\n      completed another—“Moissart and Voissart and Croissart and\n      Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart!—why, you ineffable old serpent,","that’s me—that’s me—d’ye hear? that’s me”—here I screamed at the\n      top of my voice—“that’s me-e-e! I am Napoleon Bonaparte\n      Froissart! and if I havn’t married my great, great, grandmother,\n      I wish I may be everlastingly confounded!”\n\n      Madame Eugénie Lalande, _quasi_ Simpson—formerly Moissart—was, in\n      sober fact, my great, great, grandmother. In her youth she had\n      been beautiful, and even at eighty-two, retained the majestic\n      height, the sculptural contour of head, the fine eyes and the\n      Grecian nose of her girlhood. By the aid of these, of\n      pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair, false teeth, and false\r\ntournure, as well as of the most skilful modistes of Paris, she\n      contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties _en\n      peu passées_ of the French metropolis. In this respect, indeed,\n      she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the\n      celebrated Ninon De L’Enclos.\n\n      She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second time, a\n      widow without children, she bethought herself of my existence in\n      America, and for the purpose of making me her heir, paid a visit\n      to the United States, in company with a distant and exceedingly\r\nlovely relative of her second husband’s—a Madame Stéphanie\n      Lalande.\n\n      At the opera, my great, great, grandmother’s attention was\n      arrested by my notice; and, upon surveying me through her\n      eye-glass, she was struck with a certain family resemblance to\n      herself. Thus interested, and knowing that the heir she sought\n      was actually in the city, she made inquiries of her party\n      respecting me. The gentleman who attended her knew my person, and\n      told her who I was. The information thus obtained induced her to\n      renew her scrutiny; and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened","me that I behaved in the absurd manner already detailed. She\n      returned my bow, however, under the impression that, by some odd\n      accident, I had discovered her identity. When, deceived by my\n      weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect to the\n      age and charms of the strange lady, I demanded so\n      enthusiastically of Talbot who she was, he concluded that I meant\n      the younger beauty, as a matter of course, and so informed me,\n      with perfect truth, that she was “the celebrated widow, Madame\n      Lalande.”\n\n      In the street, next morning, my great, great, grandmother\r\nencountered Talbot, an old Parisian acquaintance; and the\n      conversation, very naturally turned upon myself. My deficiencies\n      of vision were then explained; for these were notorious, although\n      I was entirely ignorant of their notoriety, and my good old\n      relative discovered, much to her chagrin, that she had been\n      deceived in supposing me aware of her identity, and that I had\n      been merely making a fool of myself in making open love, in a\n      theatre, to an old woman unknown. By way of punishing me for this\n      imprudence, she concocted with Talbot a plot. He purposely kept\r\nout of my way to avoid giving me the introduction. My street\n      inquiries about “the lovely widow, Madame Lalande,” were supposed\n      to refer to the younger lady, of course, and thus the\n      conversation with the three gentlemen whom I encountered shortly\n      after leaving Talbot’s hotel will be easily explained, as also\n      their allusion to Ninon De L’Enclos. I had no opportunity of\n      seeing Madame Lalande closely during daylight; and, at her\n      musical _soirée_, my silly weakness in refusing the aid of\n      glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her\n      age. When “Madame Lalande” was called upon to sing, the younger","lady was intended; and it was she who arose to obey the call; my\n      great, great, grandmother, to further the deception, arising at\n      the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main\n      drawing-room. Had I decided upon escorting her thither, it had\n      been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where I\n      was; but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary. The\n      songs which I so much admired, and which so confirmed my\n      impression of the youth of my mistress, were executed by Madame\n      Stéphanie Lalande. The eyeglass was presented by way of adding a\r\nreproof to the hoax—a sting to the epigram of the deception. Its\n      presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon\n      affectation with which I was so especially edified. It is almost\n      superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument, as worn by\n      the old lady, had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted\n      to my years. They suited me, in fact, to a T.\n\n      The clergyman, who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot, was a\n      boon companion of Talbot’s, and no priest. He was an excellent\n      “whip,” however; and having doffed his cassock to put on a\r\ngreat-coat, he drove the hack which conveyed the “happy couple”\n      out of town. Talbot took a seat at his side. The two scoundrels\n      were thus “in at the death,” and through a half-open window of\n      the back parlor of the inn, amused themselves in grinning at the\n      _dénouement_ of the drama. I believe I shall be forced to call\n      them both out.\n\n      Nevertheless, I am _not_ the husband of my great, great,\n      grandmother; and this is a reflection which affords me infinite\n      relief;—but I _am_ the husband of Madame Lalande—of Madame\n      Stéphanie Lalande—with whom my good old relative, besides making","me her sole heir when she dies—if she ever does—has been at the\n      trouble of concocting me a match. In conclusion: I am done\n      forever with _billets doux_, and am never to be met without\n      SPECTACLES.\n\n\n\n\nKING PEST\n\n\n      A Tale Containing an Allegory.\n\n     The gods do bear and will allow in kings\n     The things which they abhor in rascal routes.\n                    —_Buckhurst’s Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex._\n\n      About twelve o’clock, one night in the month of October, and\n      during the chivalrous reign of the third Edward, two seamen\n      belonging to the crew of the _>Free and Easy_, a trading schooner\r\nplying between Sluys and the Thames, and then at anchor in that\n      river, were much astonished to find themselves seated in the\n      tap-room of an ale-house in the parish of St. Andrews,\n      London—which ale-house bore for sign the portraiture of a “Jolly\n      Tar.”\n\n      The room, although ill-contrived, smoke-blackened, low-pitched,\n      and in every other respect agreeing with the general character of\n      such places at the period—was, nevertheless, in the opinion of\n      the grotesque groups scattered here and there within it,\n      sufficiently well adapted to its purpose.\r\nOf these groups our two seamen formed, I think, the most\n      interesting, if not the most conspicuous.\n\n      The one who appeared to be the elder, and whom his companion\n      addressed by the characteristic appellation of “Legs,” was at the\n      same time much the taller of the two. He might have measured six\n      feet and a half, and an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to\n      have been the necessary consequence of an altitude so enormous.\n      Superfluities in height were, however, more than accounted for by\n      deficiencies in other respects. He was exceedingly thin; and","might, as his associates asserted, have answered, when drunk, for\n      a pennant at the mast-head, or, when sober, have served for a\n      jib-boom. But these jests, and others of a similar nature, had\n      evidently produced, at no time, any effect upon the cachinnatory\n      muscles of the tar. With high cheek-bones, a large hawk-nose,\n      retreating chin, fallen under-jaw, and huge protruding white\n      eyes, the expression of his countenance, although tinged with a\n      species of dogged indifference to matters and things in general,\n      was not the less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts\n      at imitation or description.\r\nThe younger seaman was, in all outward appearance, the converse\n      of his companion. His stature could not have exceeded four feet.\n      A pair of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat, unwieldy figure,\n      while his unusually short and thick arms, with no ordinary fists\n      at their extremities, swung off dangling from his sides like the\n      fins of a sea-turtle. Small eyes, of no particular color,\n      twinkled far back in his head. His nose remained buried in the\n      mass of flesh which enveloped his round, full, and purple face;\n      and his thick upper-lip rested upon the still thicker one beneath\r\nwith an air of complacent self-satisfaction, much heightened by\n      the owner’s habit of licking them at intervals. He evidently\n      regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling half-wondrous,\n      half-quizzical; and stared up occasionally in his face as the red\n      setting sun stares up at the crags of Ben Nevis.\n\n      Various and eventful, however, had been the peregrinations of the\n      worthy couple in and about the different tap-houses of the\n      neighbourhood during the earlier hours of the night. Funds even\n      the most ample, are not always everlasting: and it was with empty","pockets our friends had ventured upon the present hostelrie.\n\n      At the precise period, then, when this history properly\n      commences, Legs, and his fellow Hugh Tarpaulin, sat, each with\n      both elbows resting upon the large oaken table in the middle of\n      the floor, and with a hand upon either cheek. They were eyeing,\n      from behind a huge flagon of unpaid-for “humming-stuff,” the\n      portentous words, “No Chalk,” which to their indignation and\n      astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of that very\n      mineral whose presence they purported to deny. Not that the gift\r\nof decyphering written characters—a gift among the commonalty of\n      that day considered little less cabalistical than the art of\n      inditing—could, in strict justice, have been laid to the charge\n      of either disciple of the sea; but there was, to say the truth, a\n      certain twist in the formation of the letters—an indescribable\n      lee-lurch about the whole—which foreboded, in the opinion of both\n      seamen, a long run of dirty weather; and determined them at once,\n      in the allegorical words of Legs himself, to “pump ship, clew up\n      all sail, and scud before the wind.”\r\nHaving accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale, and\n      looped up the points of their short doublets, they finally made a\n      bolt for the street. Although Tarpaulin rolled twice into the\n      fire-place, mistaking it for the door, yet their escape was at\n      length happily effected—and half after twelve o’clock found our\n      heroes ripe for mischief, and running for life down a dark alley\n      in the direction of St. Andrew’s Stair, hotly pursued by the\n      landlady of the “Jolly Tar.”\n\n      At the epoch of this eventful tale, and periodically, for many\n      years before and after, all England, but more especially the","metropolis, resounded with the fearful cry of “Plague!” The city\n      was in a great measure depopulated—and in those horrible regions,\n      in the vicinity of the Thames, where amid the dark, narrow, and\n      filthy lanes and alleys, the Demon of Disease was supposed to\n      have had his nativity, Awe, Terror, and Superstition were alone\n      to be found stalking abroad.\n\n      By authority of the king such districts were placed under ban,\n      and all persons forbidden, under pain of death, to intrude upon\n      their dismal solitude. Yet neither the mandate of the monarch,\n      nor the huge barriers erected at the entrances of the streets,\r\nnor the prospect of that loathsome death which, with almost\n      absolute certainty, overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could\n      deter from the adventure, prevented the unfurnished and\n      untenanted dwellings from being stripped, by the hand of nightly\n      rapine, of every article, such as iron, brass, or lead-work,\n      which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account.\n\n      Above all, it was usually found, upon the annual winter opening\n      of the barriers, that locks, bolts, and secret cellars, had\n      proved but slender protection to those rich stores of wines and\r\nliquors which, in consideration of the risk and trouble of\n      removal, many of the numerous dealers having shops in the\n      neighbourhood had consented to trust, during the period of exile,\n      to so insufficient a security.\n\n      But there were very few of the terror-stricken people who\n      attributed these doings to the agency of human hands.\n      Pest-spirits, plague-goblins, and fever-demons, were the popular\n      imps of mischief; and tales so blood-chilling were hourly told,\n      that the whole mass of forbidden buildings was, at length,\n      enveloped in terror as in a shroud, and the plunderer himself was","often scared away by the horrors his own depreciations had\n      created; leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited district\n      to gloom, silence, pestilence, and death.\n\n      It was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned, and\n      which indicated the region beyond to be under the Pest-ban, that,\n      in scrambling down an alley, Legs and the worthy Hugh Tarpaulin\n      found their progress suddenly impeded. To return was out of the\n      question, and no time was to be lost, as their pursuers were\n      close upon their heels. With thorough-bred seamen to clamber up\r\nthe roughly fashioned plank-work was a trifle; and, maddened with\n      the twofold excitement of exercise and liquor, they leaped\n      unhesitatingly down within the enclosure, and holding on their\n      drunken course with shouts and yellings, were soon bewildered in\n      its noisome and intricate recesses.\n\n      Had they not, indeed, been intoxicated beyond moral sense, their\n      reeling footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their\n      situation. The air was cold and misty. The paving-stones,\n      loosened from their beds, lay in wild disorder amid the tall,\n      rank grass, which sprang up around the feet and ankles. Fallen\r\nhouses choked up the streets. The most fetid and poisonous smells\n      everywhere prevailed;—and by the aid of that ghastly light which,\n      even at midnight, never fails to emanate from a vapory and\n      pestilential atmosphere, might be discerned lying in the by-paths\n      and alleys, or rotting in the windowless habitations, the carcass\n      of many a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague\n      in the very perpetration of his robbery.\n\n      But it lay not in the power of images, or sensations, or\n      impediments such as these, to stay the course of men who,","naturally brave, and at that time especially, brimful of courage\n      and of “humming-stuff,” would have reeled, as straight as their\n      condition might have permitted, undauntedly into the very jaws of\n      Death. Onward—still onward stalked the grim Legs, making the\n      desolate solemnity echo and re-echo with yells like the terrific\n      war-whoop of the Indian; and onward, still onward rolled the\n      dumpy Tarpaulin, hanging on to the doublet of his more active\n      companion, and far surpassing the latter’s most strenuous\n      exertions in the way of vocal music, by bull-roarings _in basso_,\r\nfrom the profundity of his stentorian lungs.\n\n      They had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence.\n      Their way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more\n      horrible—the paths more narrow and more intricate. Huge stones\n      and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them,\n      gave evidence, by their sullen and heavy descent, of the vast\n      height of the surrounding houses; and while actual exertion\n      became necessary to force a passage through frequent heaps of\n      rubbish, it was by no means seldom that the hand fell upon a\n      skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse.\r\nSuddenly, as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall\n      and ghastly-looking building, a yell more than usually shrill\n      from the throat of the excited Legs, was replied to from within,\n      in a rapid succession of wild, laughter-like, and fiendish\n      shrieks. Nothing daunted at sounds which, of such a nature, at\n      such a time, and in such a place, might have curdled the very\n      blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire, the drunken couple\n      rushed headlong against the door, burst it open, and staggered\n      into the midst of things with a volley of curses.","The room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop\n      of an undertaker; but an open trap-door, in a corner of the floor\n      near the entrance, looked down upon a long range of wine-cellars,\n      whose depths the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed\n      to be well stored with their appropriate contents. In the middle\n      of the room stood a table—in the centre of which again arose a\n      huge tub of what appeared to be punch. Bottles of various wines\n      and cordials, together with jugs, pitchers, and flagons of every\n      shape and quality, were scattered profusely upon the board.\r\nAround it, upon coffin-tressels, was seated a company of six.\n      This company I will endeavor to delineate one by one.\n\n      Fronting the entrance, and elevated a little above his\n      companions, sat a personage who appeared to be the president of\n      the table. His stature was gaunt and tall, and Legs was\n      confounded to behold in him a figure more emaciated than himself.\n      His face was as yellow as saffron—but no feature excepting one\n      alone, was sufficiently marked to merit a particular description.\n      This one consisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously\r\nlofty, as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh\n      superadded upon the natural head. His mouth was puckered and\n      dimpled into an expression of ghastly affability, and his eyes,\n      as indeed the eyes of all at table, were glazed over with the\n      fumes of intoxication. This gentleman was clothed from head to\n      foot in a richly-embroidered black silk-velvet pall, wrapped\n      negligently around his form after the fashion of a Spanish cloak.\n      His head was stuck full of sable hearse-plumes, which he nodded\n      to and fro with a jaunty and knowing air; and, in his right hand,","he held a huge human thigh-bone, with which he appeared to have\n      been just knocking down some member of the company for a song.\n\n      Opposite him, and with her back to the door, was a lady of no\n      whit the less extraordinary character. Although quite as tall as\n      the person just described, she had no right to complain of his\n      unnatural emaciation. She was evidently in the last stage of a\n      dropsy; and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon\n      of October beer which stood, with the head driven in, close by\n      her side, in a corner of the chamber. Her face was exceedingly\r\nround, red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or rather want of\n      peculiarity, attached itself to her countenance, which I before\n      mentioned in the case of the president—that is to say, only one\n      feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a\n      separate characterization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately\n      observed that the same remark might have applied to each\n      individual person of the party; every one of whom seemed to\n      possess a monopoly of some particular portion of physiognomy.\n      With the lady in question this portion proved to be the mouth.\r\nCommencing at the right ear, it swept with a terrific chasm to\n      the left—the short pendants which she wore in either auricle\n      continually bobbing into the aperture. She made, however, every\n      exertion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified, in a dress\n      consisting of a newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close\n      under her chin, with a crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin.\n\n      At her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared\n      to patronise. This delicate little creature, in the trembling of\n      her wasted fingers, in the livid hue of her lips, and in the","slight hectic spot which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion,\n      gave evident indications of a galloping consumption. An air of\n      extreme _haut ton_, however, pervaded her whole appearance; she\n      wore in a graceful and _dégagé_ manner, a large and beautiful\n      winding-sheet of the finest India lawn; her hair hung in ringlets\n      over her neck; a soft smile played about her mouth; but her nose,\n      extremely long, thin, sinuous, flexible and pimpled, hung down\n      far below her under lip, and in spite of the delicate manner in\n      which she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her\r\ntongue, gave to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression.\n\n      Over against her, and upon the left of the dropsical lady, was\n      seated a little puffy, wheezing, and gouty old man, whose cheeks\n      reposed upon the shoulders of their owner, like two huge bladders\n      of Oporto wine. With his arms folded, and with one bandaged leg\n      deposited upon the table, he seemed to think himself entitled to\n      some consideration. He evidently prided himself much upon every\n      inch of his personal appearance, but took more especial delight\n      in calling attention to his gaudy-colored surtout. This, to say\r\nthe truth, must have cost him no little money, and was made to\n      fit him exceedingly well—being fashioned from one of the\n      curiously embroidered silken covers appertaining to those\n      glorious escutcheons which, in England and elsewhere, are\n      customarily hung up, in some conspicuous place, upon the\n      dwellings of departed aristocracy.\n\n      Next to him, and at the right hand of the president, was a\n      gentleman in long white hose and cotton drawers. His frame shook,\n      in a ridiculous manner, with a fit of what Tarpaulin called “the\n      horrors.” His jaws, which had been newly shaved, were tightly","tied up by a bandage of muslin; and his arms being fastened in a\n      similar way at the wrists, prevented him from helping himself too\n      freely to the liquors upon the table; a precaution rendered\n      necessary, in the opinion of Legs, by the peculiarly sottish and\n      wine-bibbing cast of his visage. A pair of prodigious ears,\n      nevertheless, which it was no doubt found impossible to confine,\n      towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment, and were\n      occasionally pricked up in a spasm, at the sound of the drawing\n      of a cork.\n\n      Fronting him, sixthly and lastly, was situated a singularly\r\nstiff-looking personage, who, being afflicted with paralysis,\n      must, to speak seriously, have felt very ill at ease in his\n      unaccommodating habiliments. He was habited, somewhat uniquely,\n      in a new and handsome mahogany coffin. Its top or head-piece\n      pressed upon the skull of the wearer, and extended over it in the\n      fashion of a hood, giving to the entire face an air of\n      indescribable interest. Arm-holes had been cut in the sides, for\n      the sake not more of elegance than of convenience; but the dress,\n      nevertheless, prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as\r\nhis associates; and as he lay reclining against his tressel, at\n      an angle of forty-five degrees, a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled\n      up their awful whites towards the ceiling in absolute amazement\n      at their own enormity.\n\n      Before each of the party lay a portion of a skull, which was used\n      as a drinking cup. Overhead was suspended a human skeleton, by\n      means of a rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring\n      in the ceiling. The other limb, confined by no such fetter, stuck\n      off from the body at right angles, causing the whole loose and","rattling frame to dangle and twirl about at the caprice of every\n      occasional puff of wind which found its way into the apartment.\n      In the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited\n      charcoal, which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire\n      scene; while coffins, and other wares appertaining to the shop of\n      an undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and against\n      the windows, preventing any ray from escaping into the street.\n\n      At sight of this extraordinary assembly, and of their still more\n      extraordinary paraphernalia, our two seamen did not conduct\r\nthemselves with that degree of decorum which might have been\n      expected. Legs, leaning against the wall near which he happened\n      to be standing, dropped his lower jaw still lower than usual, and\n      spread open his eyes to their fullest extent: while Hugh\n      Tarpaulin, stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a level\n      with the table, and spreading out a palm upon either knee, burst\n      into a long, loud, and obstreperous roar of very ill-timed and\n      immoderate laughter.\n\n      Without, however, taking offence at behaviour so excessively\n      rude, the tall president smiled very graciously upon the\r\nintruders—nodded to them in a dignified manner with his head of\n      sable plumes—and, arising, took each by an arm, and led him to a\n      seat which some others of the company had placed in the meantime\n      for his accommodation. Legs to all this offered not the slightest\n      resistance, but sat down as he was directed; while the gallant\n      Hugh, removing his coffin tressel from its station near the head\n      of the table, to the vicinity of the little consumptive lady in\n      the winding sheet, plumped down by her side in high glee, and\n      pouring out a skull of red wine, quaffed it to their better","acquaintance. But at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the\n      coffin seemed exceedingly nettled; and serious consequences might\n      have ensued, had not the president, rapping upon the table with\n      his truncheon, diverted the attention of all present to the\n      following speech:\n\n      “It becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion—”\n\n      “Avast there!” interrupted Legs, looking very serious, “avast\n      there a bit, I say, and tell us who the devil ye all are, and\n      what business ye have here, rigged off like the foul fiends, and\n      swilling the snug blue ruin stowed away for the winter by my\r\nhonest shipmate, Will Wimble, the undertaker!”\n\n      At this unpardonable piece of ill-breeding, all the original\n      company half started to their feet, and uttered the same rapid\n      succession of wild fiendish shrieks which had before caught the\n      attention of the seamen. The president, however, was the first to\n      recover his composure, and at length, turning to Legs with great\n      dignity, recommenced:\n\n      “Most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the\n      part of guests so illustrious, unbidden though they be. Know then\n      that in these dominions I am monarch, and here rule with\r\nundivided empire under the title of ‘King Pest the First.’\n\n      “This apartment, which you no doubt profanely suppose to be the\n      shop of Will Wimble the undertaker—a man whom we know not, and\n      whose plebeian appellation has never before this night thwarted\n      our royal ears—this apartment, I say, is the Dais-Chamber of our\n      Palace, devoted to the councils of our kingdom, and to other\n      sacred and lofty purposes.\n\n      “The noble lady who sits opposite is Queen Pest, our Serene\n      Consort. The other exalted personages whom you behold are all of\n      our family, and wear the insignia of the blood royal under the","respective titles of ‘His Grace the Arch Duke Pest-Iferous’—‘His\n      Grace the Duke Pest-Ilential’—‘His Grace the Duke Tem-Pest’—and\n      ‘Her Serene Highness the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.’\n\n      “As regards,” continued he, “your demand of the business upon\n      which we sit here in council, we might be pardoned for replying\n      that it concerns, and concerns alone, our own private and regal\n      interest, and is in no manner important to any other than\n      ourself. But in consideration of those rights to which as guests\n      and strangers you may feel yourselves entitled, we will\r\nfurthermore explain that we are here this night, prepared by deep\n      research and accurate investigation, to examine, analyze, and\n      thoroughly determine the indefinable spirit—the incomprehensible\n      qualities and nature—of those inestimable treasures of the\n      palate, the wines, ales, and liqueurs of this goodly metropolis:\n      by so doing to advance not more our own designs than the true\n      welfare of that unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us all,\n      whose dominions are unlimited, and whose name is ‘Death’.”\n\n      “Whose name is Davy Jones!” ejaculated Tarpaulin, helping the\r\nlady by his side to a skull of liqueur, and pouring out a second\n      for himself.\n\n      “Profane varlet!” said the president, now turning his attention\n      to the worthy Hugh, “profane and execrable wretch!—we have said,\n      that in consideration of those rights which, even in thy filthy\n      person, we feel no inclination to violate, we have condescended\n      to make reply to thy rude and unseasonable inquiries. We\n      nevertheless, for your unhallowed intrusion upon our councils,\n      believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy companion in each a\n      gallon of Black Strap—having imbibed which to the prosperity of","our kingdom—at a single draught—and upon your bended knees—ye\n      shall be forthwith free either to proceed upon your way, or\n      remain and be admitted to the privileges of our table, according\n      to your respective and individual pleasures.”\n\n      “It would be a matter of utter impossibility,” replied Legs, whom\n      the assumptions and dignity of King Pest the First had evidently\n      inspired some feelings of respect, and who arose and steadied\n      himself by the table as he spoke—“it would, please your majesty,\n      be a matter of utter impossibility to stow away in my hold even\r\none-fourth part of the same liquor which your majesty has just\n      mentioned. To say nothing of the stuffs placed on board in the\n      forenoon by way of ballast, and not to mention the various ales\n      and liqueurs shipped this evening at different sea-ports, I have,\n      at present, a full cargo of ‘humming-stuff’ taken in and duly\n      paid for at the sign of the ‘Jolly Tar.’ You will, therefore,\n      please your majesty, be so good as to take the will for the\n      deed—for by no manner of means either can I or will I swallow\n      another drop—least of all a drop of that villainous bilge-water\r\nthat answers to the name of ‘Black Strap.’”\n\n      “Belay that!” interrupted Tarpaulin, astonished not more at the\n      length of his companion’s speech than at the nature of his\n      refusal—“Belay that you lubber!—and I say, Legs, none of your\n      palaver! _My_ hull is still light, although I confess you\n      yourself seem to be a little top-heavy; and as for the matter of\n      your share of the cargo, why rather than raise a squall I would\n      find stowage-room for it myself, but—”\n\n      “This proceeding,” interposed the president, “is by no means in\n      accordance with the terms of the mulct or sentence, which is in","its nature Median, and not to be altered or recalled. The\n      conditions we have imposed must be fulfilled to the letter, and\n      that without a moment’s hesitation—in failure of which fulfilment\n      we decree that you do here be tied neck and heels together, and\n      duly drowned as rebels in yon hogshead of October beer!”\n\n      “A sentence!—a sentence!—a righteous and just sentence!—a\n      glorious decree!—a most worthy and upright, and holy\n      condemnation!” shouted the Pest family altogether. The king\n      elevated his forehead into innumerable wrinkles; the gouty little\r\nold man puffed like a pair of bellows; the lady of the winding\n      sheet waved her nose to and fro; the gentleman in the cotton\n      drawers pricked up his ears; she of the shroud gasped like a\n      dying fish; and he of the coffin looked stiff and rolled up his\n      eyes.\n\n      “Ugh! ugh! ugh!” chuckled Tarpaulin without heeding the general\n      excitation, “ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—I was\n      saying,” said he, “I was saying when Mr. King Pest poked in his\n      marlin-spike, that as for the matter of two or three gallons more\n      or less of Black Strap, it was a trifle to a tight sea-boat like\r\nmyself not overstowed—but when it comes to drinking the health of\n      the Devil (whom God assoilzie) and going down upon my marrow\n      bones to his ill-favored majesty there, whom I know, as well as I\n      know myself to be a sinner, to be nobody in the whole world, but\n      Tim Hurlygurly the stage-player!—why! it’s quite another guess\n      sort of a thing, and utterly and altogether past my\n      comprehension.”\n\n      He was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquillity. At the\n      name Tim Hurlygurly the whole assembly leaped from their name\n      seats.\n\n      “Treason!” shouted his Majesty King Pest the First.","“Treason!” said the little man with the gout.\n\n      “Treason!” screamed the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.\n\n      “Treason!” muttered the gentleman with his jaws tied up.\n\n      “Treason!” growled he of the coffin.\n\n      “Treason! treason!” shrieked her majesty of the mouth; and,\n      seizing by the hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate\n      Tarpaulin, who had just commenced pouring out for himself a skull\n      of liqueur, she lifted him high into the air, and let him fall\n      without ceremony into the huge open puncheon of his beloved ale.\n      Bobbing up and down, for a few seconds, like an apple in a bowl\r\nof toddy, he, at length, finally disappeared amid the whirlpool\n      of foam which, in the already effervescent liquor, his struggles\n      easily succeeded in creating.\n\n      Not tamely, however, did the tall seaman behold the discomfiture\n      of his companion. Jostling King Pest through the open trap, the\n      valiant Legs slammed the door down upon him with an oath, and\n      strode towards the centre of the room. Here tearing down the\n      skeleton which swung over the table, he laid it about him with so\n      much energy and good will, that, as the last glimpses of light\r\ndied away within the apartment, he succeeded in knocking out the\n      brains of the little gentleman with the gout. Rushing then with\n      all his force against the fatal hogshead full of October ale and\n      Hugh Tarpaulin, he rolled it over and over in an instant. Out\n      burst a deluge of liquor so fierce—so impetuous—so\n      overwhelming—that the room was flooded from wall to wall—the\n      loaded table was overturned—the tressels were thrown upon their\n      backs—the tub of punch into the fire-place—and the ladies into\n      hysterics. Piles of death-furniture floundered about. Jugs,","pitchers, and carboys mingled promiscuously in the _mêlée_, and\n      wicker flagons encountered desperately with bottles of junk. The\n      man with the horrors was drowned upon the spot—the little stiff\n      gentleman floated off in his coffin—and the victorious Legs,\n      seizing by the waist the fat lady in the shroud, rushed out with\n      her into the street, and made a bee-line for the _Free and Easy_,\n      followed under easy sail by the redoubtable Hugh Tarpaulin, who,\n      having sneezed three or four times, panted and puffed after him\n      with the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.\n\n\n\n\nTHREE SUNDAYS IN A WEEK\r\n“You hard-headed, dunder-headed, obstinate, rusty, crusty, musty,\n      fusty, old savage!” said I, in fancy, one afternoon, to my grand\n      uncle Rumgudgeon—shaking my fist at him in imagination.\n\n      Only in imagination. The fact is, some trivial discrepancy _did_\n      exist, just then, between what I said and what I had not the\n      courage to say—between what I did and what I had half a mind to\n      do.\n\n      The old porpoise, as I opened the drawing-room door, was sitting\n      with his feet upon the mantel-piece, and a bumper of port in his\n      paw, making strenuous efforts to accomplish the ditty.\n\n      Remplis ton verre vide!\r\nVide ton verre plein!\n\n      “My _dear_ uncle,” said I, closing the door gently, and\n      approaching him with the blandest of smiles, “you are always so\n      very kind and considerate, and have evinced your benevolence in\n      so many—so very many ways—that—that I feel I have only to suggest\n      this little point to you once more to make sure of your full\n      acquiescence.”\n\n      “Hem!” said he, “good boy! go on!”\n\n      “I am sure, my dearest uncle (you confounded old rascal!), that\n      you have no design really, seriously, to oppose my union with\n      Kate. This is merely a joke of yours, I know—ha! ha! ha!—how very","pleasant you are at times.”\n\n      “Ha! ha! ha!” said he, “curse you! yes!”\n\n      “To be sure—of course! I knew you were jesting. Now, uncle, all\n      that Kate and myself wish at present, is that you would oblige us\n      with your advice as—as regards the time—you know, uncle—in short,\n      when will it be most convenient for yourself, that the wedding\n      shall—shall—come off, you know?”\n\n      “Come off, you scoundrel!—what do you mean by that?—Better wait\n      till it goes on.”\n\n      “Ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hi! hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!—oh,\n      that’s good!—oh, that’s capital—_such_ a wit! But all we want\r\njust _now_, you know, uncle, is that you would indicate the time\n      precisely.”\n\n      “Ah!—precisely?”\n\n      “Yes, uncle—that is, if it would be quite agreeable to yourself.”\n\n      “Wouldn’t it answer, Bobby, if I were to leave it at random—some\n      time within a year or so, for example?—_must_ I say precisely?”\n\n      “_If_ you please, uncle—precisely.”\n\n      “Well, then, Bobby, my boy—you’re a fine fellow, aren’t\n      you?—since you _will_ have the exact time I’ll—why I’ll oblige\n      you for once.”\n\n      “Dear uncle!”\n\n      “Hush, sir!” (drowning my voice)—“I’ll oblige you for once. You\r\nshall have my consent—and the _plum_, we mus’n’t forget the\n      plum—let me see! when shall it be? To-day’s Sunday—isn’t it?\n      Well, then, you shall be married precisely—_precisely_, now\n      mind!—_when three Sundays come together in a week!_ Do you hear\n      me, sir! _What_ are you gaping at? I say, you shall have Kate and\n      her plum when three Sundays come together in a week—but not\n      _till_ then—you young scapegrace—not _till_ then, if I die for\n      it. You know me—_I’m a man of my word_—now be off!” Here he\n      swallowed his bumper of port, while I rushed from the room in\n      despair.","A very “fine old English gentleman,” was my grand-uncle\n      Rumgudgeon, but unlike him of the song, he had his weak points.\n      He was a little, pursy, pompous, passionate semicircular\n      somebody, with a red nose, a thick skull, a long purse, and a\n      strong sense of his own consequence. With the best heart in the\n      world, he contrived, through a predominant whim of contradiction,\n      to earn for himself, among those who only knew him superficially,\n      the character of a curmudgeon. Like many excellent people, he\n      seemed possessed with a spirit of tantalization, which might\r\neasily, at a casual glance, have been mistaken for malevolence.\n      To every request, a positive “No!” was his immediate answer; but\n      in the end—in the long, long end—there were exceedingly few\n      requests which he refused. Against all attacks upon his purse he\n      made the most sturdy defence; but the amount extorted from him,\n      at last, was generally in direct ratio with the length of the\n      siege and the stubbornness of the resistance. In charity no one\n      gave more liberally or with a worse grace.\n\n      For the fine arts, and especially for the belles-lettres, he\r\nentertained a profound contempt. With this he had been inspired\n      by Casimir Perier, whose pert little query “A quoi un poete est\n      il bon?” he was in the habit of quoting, with a very droll\n      pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra of logical wit. Thus my own\n      inkling for the Muses had excited his entire displeasure. He\n      assured me one day, when I asked him for a new copy of Horace,\n      that the translation of “Poeta nascitur non fit” was “a nasty\n      poet for nothing fit”—a remark which I took in high dudgeon. His\n      repugnance to “the humanities” had, also, much increased of late,","by an accidental bias in favor of what he supposed to be natural\n      science. Somebody had accosted him in the street, mistaking him\n      for no less a personage than Doctor Dubble L. Dee, the lecturer\n      upon quack physics. This set him off at a tangent; and just at\n      the epoch of this story—for story it is getting to be after\n      all—my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only\n      upon points which happened to chime in with the caprioles of the\n      hobby he was riding. For the rest, he laughed with his arms and\n      legs, and his politics were stubborn and easily understood. He\r\nthought, with Horsley, that “the people have nothing to do with\n      the laws but to obey them.”\n\n      I had lived with the old gentleman all my life. My parents, in\n      dying, had bequeathed me to him as a rich legacy. I believe the\n      old villain loved me as his own child—nearly if not quite as well\n      as he loved Kate—but it was a dog’s existence that he led me,\n      after all. From my first year until my fifth, he obliged me with\n      very regular floggings. From five to fifteen, he threatened me,\n      hourly, with the House of Correction. From fifteen to twenty, not\n      a day passed in which he did not promise to cut me off with a\r\nshilling. I was a sad dog, it is true—but then it was a part of\n      my nature—a point of my faith. In Kate, however, I had a firm\n      friend, and I knew it. She was a good girl, and told me very\n      sweetly that I might have her (plum and all) whenever I could\n      badger my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon, into the necessary consent.\n      Poor girl!—she was barely fifteen, and without this consent, her\n      little amount in the funds was not come-at-able until five\n      immeasurable summers had “dragged their slow length along.” What,\n      then, to do? At fifteen, or even at twenty-one (for I had now","passed my fifth olympiad) five years in prospect are very much\n      the same as five hundred. In vain we besieged the old gentleman\n      with importunities. Here was a piece de resistance (as Messieurs\n      Ude and Careme would say) which suited his perverse fancy to a T.\n      It would have stiffed the indignation of Job himself, to see how\n      much like an old mouser he behaved to us two poor wretched little\n      mice. In his heart he wished for nothing more ardently than our\n      union. He had made up his mind to this all along. In fact, he\n      would have given ten thousand pounds from his own pocket (Kate’s\r\nplum was her own) if he could have invented any thing like an\n      excuse for complying with our very natural wishes. But then we\n      had been so imprudent as to broach the subject ourselves. Not to\n      oppose it under such circumstances, I sincerely believe, was not\n      in his power.\n\n      I have said already that he had his weak points; but in speaking\n      of these, I must not be understood as referring to his obstinacy:\n      which was one of his strong points—“assurement ce n’ etait pas sa\n      foible.” When I mention his weakness I have allusion to a bizarre\n      old-womanish superstition which beset him. He was great in\r\ndreams, portents, et id genus omne of rigmarole. He was\n      excessively punctilious, too, upon small points of honor, and,\n      after his own fashion, was a man of his word, beyond doubt. This\n      was, in fact, one of his hobbies. The spirit of his vows he made\n      no scruple of setting at naught, but the letter was a bond\n      inviolable. Now it was this latter peculiarity in his\n      disposition, of which Kate’s ingenuity enabled us one fine day,\n      not long after our interview in the dining-room, to take a very\n      unexpected advantage, and, having thus, in the fashion of all","modern bards and orators, exhausted in prolegomena, all the time\n      at my command, and nearly all the room at my disposal, I will sum\n      up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of the story.\n\n      It happened then—so the Fates ordered it—that among the naval\n      acquaintances of my betrothed, were two gentlemen who had just\n      set foot upon the shores of England, after a year’s absence,\n      each, in foreign travel. In company with these gentlemen, my\n      cousin and I, preconcertedly paid uncle Rumgudgeon a visit on the\n      afternoon of Sunday, October the tenth,—just three weeks after\r\nthe memorable decision which had so cruelly defeated our hopes.\n      For about half an hour the conversation ran upon ordinary topics,\n      but at last, we contrived, quite naturally, to give it the\n      following turn:\n\n      CAPT. PRATT. “Well I have been absent just one year.—Just one\n      year to-day, as I live—let me see! yes!—this is October the\n      tenth. You remember, Mr. Rumgudgeon, I called, this day year to\n      bid you good-bye. And by the way, it does seem something like a\n      coincidence, does it not—that our friend, Captain Smitherton,\n      here, has been absent exactly a year also—a year to-day!”\r\nSMITHERTON. “Yes! just one year to a fraction. You will remember,\n      Mr. Rumgudgeon, that I called with Capt. Pratol on this very day,\n      last year, to pay my parting respects.”\n\n      UNCLE. “Yes, yes, yes—I remember it very well—very queer indeed!\n      Both of you gone just one year. A very strange coincidence,\n      indeed! Just what Doctor Dubble L. Dee would denominate an\n      extraordinary concurrence of events. Doctor Dub—”\n\n      KATE. (Interrupting.) “To be sure, papa, it is something strange;\n      but then Captain Pratt and Captain Smitherton didn’t go\n      altogether the same route, and that makes a difference, you","know.”\n\n      UNCLE. “I don’t know any such thing, you huzzy! How should I? I\n      think it only makes the matter more remarkable, Doctor Dubble L.\n      Dee—”\n\n      KATE. “Why, papa, Captain Pratt went round Cape Horn, and Captain\n      Smitherton doubled the Cape of Good Hope.”\n\n      UNCLE. “Precisely!—the one went east and the other went west, you\n      jade, and they both have gone quite round the world. By the by,\n      Doctor Dubble L. Dee—”\n\n      MYSELF. (Hurriedly.) “Captain Pratt, you must come and spend the\n      evening with us to-morrow—you and Smitherton—you can tell us all\r\nabout your voyage, and we’ll have a game of whist and—”\n\n      PRATT. “Wist, my dear fellow—you forget. To-morrow will be\n      Sunday. Some other evening—”\n\n      KATE. “Oh, no, fie!—Robert’s not quite so bad as that. To-day’s\n      Sunday.”\n\n      PRATT. “I beg both your pardons—but I can’t be so much mistaken.\n      I know to-morrow’s Sunday, because-”\n\n      SMITHERTON. (Much surprised.) “What are you all thinking about?\n      Wasn’t yesterday, Sunday, I should like to know?”\n\n      ALL. “Yesterday indeed! you are out!”\n\n      UNCLE. “To-day’s Sunday, I say—don’t I know?”\n\n      PRATT. “Oh no!—to-morrow’s Sunday.”\r\nSMITHERTON. “You are all mad—every one of you. I am as positive\n      that yesterday was Sunday as I am that I sit upon this chair.”\n\n      KATE. (Jumping up eagerly.) “I see it—I see it all. Papa, this is\n      a judgment upon you, about—about you know what. Let me alone, and\n      I’ll explain it all in a minute. It’s a very simple thing,\n      indeed. Captain Smitherton says that yesterday was Sunday: so it\n      was; he is right. Cousin Bobby, and uncle and I say that to-day\n      is Sunday: so it is; we are right. Captain Pratt maintains that\n      to-morrow will be Sunday: so it will; he is right, too. The fact","is, we are all right, and thus three Sundays have come together\n      in a week.”\n\n      SMITHERTON. (After a pause.) “By the by, Pratt, Kate has us\n      completely. What fools we two are! Mr. Rumgudgeon, the matter\n      stands thus: the earth, you know, is twenty-four thousand miles\n      in circumference. Now this globe of the earth turns upon its own\n      axis—revolves—spins round—these twenty-four thousand miles of\n      extent, going from west to east, in precisely twenty-four hours.\n      Do you understand, Mr. Rumgudgeon?—”\n\n      UNCLE. “To be sure—to be sure—Doctor Dub—”\n\n      SMITHERTON. (Drowning his voice.) “Well, sir; that is at the rate\r\nof one thousand miles per hour. Now, suppose that I sail from\n      this position a thousand miles east. Of course I anticipate the\n      rising of the sun here at London by just one hour. I see the sun\n      rise one hour before you do. Proceeding, in the same direction,\n      yet another thousand miles, I anticipate the rising by two\n      hours—another thousand, and I anticipate it by three hours, and\n      so on, until I go entirely round the globe, and back to this\n      spot, when, having gone twenty-four thousand miles east, I\n      anticipate the rising of the London sun by no less than\r\ntwenty-four hours; that is to say, I am a day in advance of your\n      time. Understand, eh?”\n\n      UNCLE. “But Double L. Dee—”\n\n      SMITHERTON. (Speaking very loud.) “Captain Pratt, on the\n      contrary, when he had sailed a thousand miles west of this\n      position, was an hour, and when he had sailed twenty-four\n      thousand miles west, was twenty-four hours, or one day, behind\n      the time at London. Thus, with me, yesterday was Sunday—thus,\n      with you, to-day is Sunday—and thus, with Pratt, to-morrow will\n      be Sunday. And what is more, Mr. Rumgudgeon, it is positively","clear that we are all right; for there can be no philosophical\n      reason assigned why the idea of one of us should have preference\n      over that of the other.”\n\n      UNCLE. “My eyes!—well, Kate—well, Bobby!—this is a judgment upon\n      me, as you say. But I am a man of my word—mark that! you shall\n      have her, boy, (plum and all), when you please. Done up, by Jove!\n      Three Sundays all in a row! I’ll go, and take Dubble L. Dee’s\n      opinion upon that.”\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, Volume 3, by Edgar Allan Poe\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WORKS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE, VOL. 3 ***\r\n***** This file should be named 2149-0.txt or 2149-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/4/2149/\n\nProduced by David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

south seas and\r\n      elsewhere of which an account is given in the following pages\r\n      accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in\r\n      richmond va who felt deep interest in all matters relating to\r\n      the regions i had visited and who were constantly urging it upon\r\n      me as a duty to give my narrative to the public i had several\r\n      reasons however for declining to do so some of which were of a\r\n      nature altogether private and concern no person but myself\r\n      others not so much so one consideration which deterred me was\r\n      that having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time\r\n      in which i was absent i feared i should not be able to write\r\n      from mere memory a statement so minute and connected as to have\r\n      the appearanceof that truth it would really possess barring\r\n      only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us\r\n      are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence\r\n      in exciting the imaginative faculties another reason was that\r\n      the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively\r\n      marvellous that unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be\r\n      except by the evidence of a single individual and he a\r\n      halfbreed indian i could only hope for belief among my family\r\n      and those of my friends who have had reason through life to put\r\n      faith in my veracitythe probability being that the public at\r\n      large would regard what i should put forth as merely an impudent\r\n      and ingenious fiction a distrust in my own abilities as a writer\r\n      was nevertheless one of the principal causes which prevented me\r\n      from complying with the suggestions of my advisers\r\n\r\n      among those gentlemen in virginia who expressed the greatest\r\n      interest in my statement more particularly in regard to that\r\n      portion of it which related to the antarctic ocean was mr poe\r\n      lately editor of the southern literary messenger a monthly\r\n      magazine published by mr thomas w white in the city of\r\n      richmond he strongly advised me among others to prepare at\r\n      once a full account of what i had seen and undergone and trust\r\n      to the shrewdness and commonsense of the publicinsisting with\r\n      great plausibility that however roughly as regards mere\r\n      authorship my book should be got up its very uncouthness if\r\n      there were any would give it all the better chance of being\r\n      received as truth\r\n\r\n      notwithstanding this representation i did not make up my mind to\r\n      do as he suggested he afterward proposed finding that i would\r\n      not stir in the matter that i should allow him to draw up in\r\n      his own words a narrative of the earlier portion of my\r\n      adventures from facts afforded by myself publishing it in the\r\n      southern messenger under the garb of fiction to this\r\n      perceiving no objection i consented stipulating only that my\r\n      real name should be retained two numbers of the pretended\r\n      fiction appeared consequently in the messenger for january\r\n      and february  and in order that it might certainly be\r\n      regarded as fiction the name of mr poe was affixed to the\r\n      articles in the table of contents of the magazine\r\n\r\n      the manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at\r\n      length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the\r\n      adventures in question for i found that in spite of the air of\r\n      fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of\r\n      my statement which appeared in the messenger without altering\r\n      or distorting a single fact the public were still not at all\r\n      disposed to receive it as fable and several letters were sent to\r\n      mr ps address distinctly expressing a conviction to the\r\n      contrary i thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would\r\n      prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence\r\n      of their own authenticity and that i had consequently little to\r\n      fear on the score of popular incredulity\r\n\r\n      this exposébeing made it will be seen at once how much of what\r\n      follows i claim to be my own writing and it will also be\r\n      understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages\r\n      which were written by mr poe even to those readers who have not\r\n      seen the messenger it will be unnecessary to point out where\r\n      his portion ends and my own commences the difference in point of\r\n      style will be readily perceived\r\n\r\na g pym\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      my name is arthur gordon pym my father was a respectable trader\r\n      in seastores at nantucket where i was born my maternal\r\n      grandfather was an attorney in good practice he was fortunate in\r\n      every thing and had speculated very successfully in stocks of\r\n      the edgarton new bank as it was formerly called by these and\r\n      other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money he\r\n      was more attached to myself i believe than to any other person\r\n      in the world and i expected to inherit the most of his property\r\n      at his death he sent me at six years of age to the school of\r\n      old mr ricketts a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric\r\n      mannershe is well known to almost every person who has visited\r\n      new bedford i stayed at his school until i was sixteen when i\r\n      left him for mr e ronalds academy on the hill here i became\r\n      intimate with the son of mr barnard a seacaptain who\r\n      generally sailed in the employ of lloyd and vredenburghmr\r\n      barnard is also very well known in new bedford and has many\r\n      relations i am certain in edgarton his son was named augustus\r\n      and he was nearly two years older than myself he had been on a\r\n      whaling voyage with his father in the john donaldson and was\r\n      always talking to me of his adventures in the south pacific\r\n      ocean i used frequently to go home with him and remain all day\r\n      and sometimes all night we occupied the same bed and he would\r\n      be sure to keep me awake until almost light telling me stories\r\n      of the natives of the island of tinian and other places he had\r\n      visited in his travels at last i could not help being interested\r\n      in what he said and by degrees i felt the greatest desire to go\r\n      to sea i owned a sailboat called the ariel and worth about\r\n      seventyfive dollars she had a halfdeck or cuddy and was\r\n      rigged sloopfashioni forget her tonnage but she would hold ten\r\n      persons without much crowding in this boat we were in the habit\r\n      of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world and when i\r\n      now think of them it appears to me a thousand wonders that i am\r\n      alive today\r\n\r\n      i will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a\r\n      longer and more momentous narrative one night there was a party\r\n      at mr barnards and both augustus and myself were not a little\r\n      intoxicated toward the close of it as usual in such cases i\r\n      took part of his bed in preference to going home he went to\r\n      sleep as i thought very quietly it being near one when the\r\n      party broke up and without saying a word on his favorite topic\r\n      it might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in\r\n      bed and i was just about falling into a doze when he suddenly\r\n      started up and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go\r\n      to sleep for any arthur pym in christendom when there was so\r\n      glorious a breeze from the southwest i never was so astonished\r\n      in my life not knowing what he intended and thinking that the\r\n      wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside\r\n      himself he proceeded to talk very coolly however saying he\r\n      knew that i supposed him intoxicated but that he was never more\r\n      sober in his life he was only tired he added of lying in bed\r\n      on such a fine night like a dog and was determined to get up and\r\n      dress and go out on a frolic with the boat i can hardly tell\r\n      what possessed me but the words were no sooner out of his mouth\r\n      than i felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure and\r\n      thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most\r\n      reasonable things in the world it was blowing almost a gale and\r\n      the weather was very coldit being late in october i sprang out\r\n      of bed nevertheless in a kind of ecstasy and told him i was\r\n      quite as brave as himself and quite as tired as he was of lying\r\n      in bed like a dog and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as\r\n      any augustus barnard in nantucket\r\n\r\n      we lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to\r\n      the boat she was lying at the old decayed wharf by the\r\n      lumberyard of pankey  co and almost thumping her side out\r\n      against the rough logs augustus got into her and bailed her for\r\n      she was nearly half full of water this being done we hoisted\r\n      jib and mainsail kept full and started boldly out to sea\r\n\r\n      the wind as i before said blew freshly from the southwest the\r\n      night was very clear and cold augustus had taken the helm and i\r\n      stationed myself by the mast on the deck of the cuddy we flew\r\n      along at a great rateneither of us having said a word since\r\n      casting loose from the wharf i now asked my companion what\r\n      course he intended to steer and what time he thought it probable\r\n      we should get back he whistled for a few minutes and then said\r\n      crustily i am going to seayou may go home if you think\r\n      proper turning my eyes upon him i perceived at once that in\r\n      spite of his assumed nonchalance he was greatly agitated i\r\n      could see him distinctly by the light of the moonhis face was\r\n      paler than any marble and his hand shook so excessively that he\r\n      could scarcely retain hold of the tiller i found that something\r\n      had gone wrong and became seriously alarmed at this period i\r\n      knew little about the management of a boat and was now depending\r\n      entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend the wind too had\r\n      suddenly increased as we were fast getting out of the lee of the\r\n      landstill i was ashamed to betray any trepidation and for\r\n      almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence i could stand\r\n      it no longer however and spoke to augustus about the propriety\r\n      of turning back as before it was nearly a minute before he made\r\n      answer or took any notice of my suggestion byandby said he\r\n      at lengthtime enoughhome byandby i had expected a similar\r\n      reply but there was something in the tone of these words which\r\n      filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread i again looked\r\n      at the speaker attentively his lips were perfectly livid and\r\n      his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely\r\n      able to stand for gods sake augustus i screamed now\r\n      heartily frightened what ails youwhat is the matterwhat\r\n      are you going to do matter he stammered in the greatest\r\n      apparent surprise letting go the tiller at the same moment and\r\n      falling forward into the bottom of the boatmatterwhy nothing\r\n      is themattergoing homedddont you see the whole truth now\r\n      flashed upon me i flew to him and raised him up he was\r\n      drunkbeastly drunkhe could no longer either stand speak or\r\n      see his eyes were perfectly glazed and as i let him go in the\r\n      extremity of my despair he rolled like a mere log into the\r\n      bilgewater from which i had lifted him it was evident that\r\n      during the evening he had drunk far more than i suspected and\r\n      that his conduct in bed had been the result of a\r\n      highlyconcentrated state of intoxicationa state which like\r\n      madness frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward\r\n      demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses the\r\n      coolness of the night air however had had its usual effectthe\r\n      mental energy began to yield before its influenceand the\r\n      confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous\r\n      situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe he was now\r\n      thoroughly insensible and there was no probability that he would\r\n      be otherwise for many hours\r\n\r\n      it is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror the\r\n      fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated leaving me doubly\r\n      timid and irresolute i knew that i was altogether incapable of\r\n      managing the boat and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide\r\n      were hurrying us to destruction a storm was evidently gathering\r\n      behind us we had neither compass nor provisions and it was\r\n      clear that if we held our present course we should be out of\r\n      sight of land before daybreak these thoughts with a crowd of\r\n      others equally fearful flashed through my mind with a\r\n      bewildering rapidity and for some moments paralyzed me beyond\r\n      the possibility of making any exertion the boat was going\r\n      through the water at a terrible ratefull before the windno reef\r\n      in either jib or mainsailrunning her bows completely under the\r\n      foam it was a thousand wonders she did not broach toaugustus\r\n      having let go the tiller as i said before and i being too much\r\n      agitated to think of taking it myself by good luck however she\r\n      kept steady and gradually i recovered some degree of presence of\r\n      mind still the wind was increasing fearfully and whenever we\r\n      rose from a plunge forward the sea behind fell combing over our\r\n      counter and deluged us with water i was so utterly benumbed\r\n      too in every limb as to be nearly unconscious of sensation at\r\n      length i summoned up the resolution of despair and rushing to\r\n      the mainsail let it go by the run as might have been expected\r\n      it flew over the bows and getting drenched with water carried\r\n      away the mast short off by the board this latter accident alone\r\n      saved me from instant destruction under the jib only i now\r\n      boomed along before the wind shipping heavy seas occasionally\r\n      over the counter but relieved from the terror of immediate\r\n      death i took the helm and breathed with greater freedom as i\r\n      found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape\r\n      augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat and as\r\n      there was imminent danger of his drowning the water being nearly\r\n      a foot deep just where he fell i contrived to raise him\r\n      partially up and keep him in a sitting position by passing a\r\n      rope round his waist and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of\r\n      the cuddy having thus arranged every thing as well as i could in\r\n      my chilled and agitated condition i recommended myself to god\r\n      and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the\r\n      fortitude in my power\r\n\r\n      hardly had i come to this resolution when suddenly a loud and\r\n      long scream or yell as if from the throats of a thousand demons\r\n      seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat\r\n      never while i live shall i forget the intense agony of terror i\r\n      experienced at that moment my hair stood erect on my headi felt\r\n      the blood congealing in my veinsmy heart ceased utterly to beat\r\n      and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my\r\n      alarm i tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my\r\n      fallen companion\r\n\r\n      i found myself upon reviving in the cabin of a large\r\n      whalingship the penguin bound to nantucket several persons\r\n      were standing over me and augustus paler than death was busily\r\n      occupied in chafing my hands upon seeing me open my eyes his\r\n      exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and\r\n      tears from the roughlooking personages who were present the\r\n      mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained we had\r\n      been run down by the whalingship which was closehauled\r\n      beating up to nantucket with every sail she could venture to set\r\n      and consequently running almost at right angles to our own\r\n      course several men were on the lookout forward but did not\r\n      perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming\r\n      in contacttheir shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so\r\n      terribly alarmed me the huge ship i was told rode immediately\r\n      over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have\r\n      passed over a feather and without the least perceptible\r\n      impediment to her progress not a scream arose from the deck of\r\n      the victimthere was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling\r\n      with the roar of wind and water as the frail bark which was\r\n      swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her\r\n      destroyerbut this was all thinking our boat which it will be\r\n      remembered was dismasted some mere shell cut adrift as useless\r\n      the captain captain e t v block of new london was for\r\n      proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about\r\n      the matter luckily there were two of the lookout who swore\r\n      positively to having seen some person at our helm and\r\n      represented the possibility of yet saving him a discussion\r\n      ensued when block grew angry and after a while said that it\r\n      was no business of his to be eternally watching for eggshells\r\n      that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense and if\r\n      there was a man run down it was nobodys fault but his own he\r\n      might drown and be dammed or some language to that effect\r\n      henderson the first mate now took the matter up being justly\r\n      indignant as well as the whole ships crew at a speech evincing\r\n      so base a degree of heartless atrocity he spoke plainly seeing\r\n      himself upheld by the men told the captain he considered him a\r\n      fit subject for the gallows and that he would disobey his orders\r\n      if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore he\r\n      strode aft jostling block who turned pale and made no answer\r\n      on one side and seizing the helm gave the word in a firm\r\n      voice hardalee the men flew to their posts and the ship went\r\n      cleverly about all this had occupied nearly five minutes and it\r\n      was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that\r\n      any individual could be savedallowing any to have been on board\r\n      the boat yet as the reader has seen both augustus and myself\r\n      were rescued and our deliverance seemed to have been brought\r\n      about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune\r\n      which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special\r\n      interference of providence\r\n\r\n      while the ship was yet in stays the mate lowered the jollyboat\r\n      and jumped into her with the very two men i believe who spoke\r\n      up as having seen me at the helm they had just left the lee of\r\n      the vessel the moon still shining brightly when she made a long\r\n      and heavy roll to windward and henderson at the same moment\r\n      starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water he\r\n      would say nothing elserepeating his cry impatiently back water\r\n      back water the men put back as speedily as possible but by this\r\n      time the ship had gone round and gotten fully under headway\r\n      although all hands on board were making great exertions to take\r\n      in sail in despite of the danger of the attempt the mate clung\r\n      to the mainchains as soon as they came within his reach another\r\n      huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of\r\n      water nearly as far as her keel when the cause of his anxiety\r\n      was rendered obvious enough the body of a man was seen to be\r\n      affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining\r\n      bottom the penguin was coppered and copperfastened and\r\n      beating violently against it with every movement of the hull\r\n      after several ineffectual efforts made during the lurches of the\r\n      ship and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat i was finally\r\n      disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on boardfor the\r\n      body proved to be my own it appeared that one of the\r\n      timberbolts having started and broken a passage through the\r\n      copper it had arrested my progress as i passed under the ship\r\n      and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom the\r\n      head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green\r\n      baize jacket i had on and through the back part of my neck\r\n      forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right\r\n      ear i was immediately put to bedalthough life seemed to be\r\n      totally extinct there was no surgeon on board the captain\r\n      however treated me with every attentionto make amends i\r\n      presume in the eyes of his crew for his atrocious behaviour in\r\n      the previous portion of the adventure\r\n\r\n      in the meantime henderson had again put off from the ship\r\n      although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane he had not\r\n      been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our\r\n      boat and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that\r\n      he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring\r\n      of the tempest this induced the hardy seamen to persevere in\r\n      their search for more than half an hour although repeated\r\n      signals to return were made them by captain block and although\r\n      every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them\r\n      with the most imminent and deadly peril indeed it is nearly\r\n      impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could\r\n      have escaped destruction for a single instant she was built\r\n      however for the whaling service and was fitted as i have since\r\n      had reason to believe with airboxes in the manner of some\r\n      lifeboats used on the coast of wales\r\n\r\n      after searching in vain for about the period of time just\r\n      mentioned it was determined to get back to the ship they had\r\n      scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark\r\n      object that floated rapidly by they pursued and soon overtook\r\n      it it proved to be the entire deck of the ariels cuddy\r\n      augustus was struggling near it apparently in the last agonies\r\n      upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a\r\n      rope to the floating timber this rope it will be remembered i\r\n      had myself tied around his waist and made fast to a ringbolt\r\n      for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position and my so\r\n      doing it appeared had been ultimately the means of preserving\r\n      his life the ariel was slightly put together and in going down\r\n      her frame naturally went to pieces the deck of the cuddy as\r\n      might have been expected was lifted by the force of the water\r\n      rushing in entirely from the main timbers and floated with\r\n      other fragments no doubt to the surfaceaugustus was buoyed up\r\n      with it and thus escaped a terrible death\r\n\r\n      it was more than an hour after being taken on board the penguin\r\n      before he could give any account of himself or be made to\r\n      comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our\r\n      boat at length he became thoroughly aroused and spoke much of\r\n      his sensations while in the water upon his first attaining any\r\n      degree of consciousness he found himself beneath the surface\r\n      whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity and with a\r\n      rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck in an\r\n      instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward when his\r\n      head striking violently against a hard substance he again\r\n      relapsed into insensibility upon once more reviving he was in\r\n      fuller possession of his reasonthis was still however in the\r\n      greatest degree clouded and confused he now knew that some\r\n      accident had occurred and that he was in the water although his\r\n      mouth was above the surface and he could breathe with some\r\n      freedom possibly at this period the deck was drifting rapidly\r\n      before the wind and drawing him after it as he floated upon his\r\n      back of course as long as he could have retained this position\r\n      it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned\r\n      presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck and this\r\n      post he endeavored to maintain screaming at intervals for help\r\n      just before he was discovered by mr henderson he had been\r\n      obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion and falling into\r\n      the sea had given himself up for lost during the whole period\r\n      of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the\r\n      ariel nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his\r\n      disaster a vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire\r\n      possession of his faculties when he was finally picked up every\r\n      power of his mind had failed him and as before said it was\r\n      nearly an hour after getting on board the penguin before he\r\n      became fully aware of his condition in regard to myselfi was\r\n      resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death and\r\n      after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours\r\n      and a half by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot\r\n      oila proceeding suggested by augustus the wound in my neck\r\n      although of an ugly appearance proved of little real\r\n      consequence and i soon recovered from its effects\r\n\r\n      the penguin got into port about nine oclock in the morning\r\n      after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off\r\n      nantucket both augustus and myself managed to appear at mr\r\n      barnards in time for breakfastwhich luckily was somewhat\r\n      late owing to the party over night i suppose all at the table\r\n      were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded\r\n      appearanceof course it would not have borne a very rigid\r\n      scrutiny schoolboys however can accomplish wonders in the way\r\n      of deception and i verily believe not one of our friends in\r\n      nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story\r\n      told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at\r\n      sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils had reference\r\n      either to the ariel my companion or myself we two have since\r\n      very frequently talked the matter overbut never without a\r\n      shudder in one of our conversations augustus frankly confessed\r\n      to me that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so\r\n      excruciating a sense of dismay as when on board our little boat\r\n      he first discovered the extent of his intoxication and felt\r\n      himself sinking beneath its influence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      in no affairs of mere prejudice pro or con do we deduce\r\n      inferences with entire certainty even from the most simple data\r\n      it might be supposed that a catastrophe such as i have just\r\n      related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for\r\n      the sea on the contrary i never experienced a more ardent\r\n      longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a\r\n      navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance\r\n      this short period proved amply long enough to erase from my\r\n      memory the shadows and bring out in vivid light all the\r\n      pleasurably exciting points of color all the picturesqueness of\r\n      the late perilous accident my conversations with augustus grew\r\n      daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest he had a\r\n      manner of relating his stories of the ocean more than one half\r\n      of which i now suspect to have been sheer fabrications well\r\n      adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament\r\n      and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination it is strange\r\n      too that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the\r\n      life of a seaman when he depicted his more terrible moments of\r\n      suffering and despair for the bright side of the painting i had\r\n      a limited sympathy my visions were of shipwreck and famine of\r\n      death or captivity among barbarian hordes of a lifetime dragged\r\n      out in sorrow and tears upon some gray and desolate rock in an\r\n      ocean unapproachable and unknown such visions or desiresfor\r\n      they amounted to desiresare common i have since been assured\r\n      to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among menat the\r\n      time of which i speak i regarded them only as prophetic glimpses\r\n      of a destiny which i felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil\r\n      augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind it is\r\n      probable indeed that our intimate communion had resulted in a\r\n      partial interchange of character\r\n\r\n      about eighteen months after the period of the ariels disaster\r\n      the firm of lloyd and vredenburgh a house connected in some\r\n      manner with the messieurs enderby i believe of liverpool were\r\n      engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig grampus for a\r\n      whaling voyage she was an old hulk and scarcely seaworthy when\r\n      all was done to her that could be done i hardly know why she was\r\n      chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same\r\n      ownersbut so it was mr barnard was appointed to command her\r\n      and augustus was going with him while the brig was getting\r\n      ready he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the\r\n      opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel he\r\n      found me by no means an unwilling listeneryet the matter could\r\n      not be so easily arranged my father made no direct opposition\r\n      but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the\r\n      design and more than all my grandfather from whom i expected\r\n      much vowed to cut me off with a shilling if i should ever broach\r\n      the subject to him again these difficulties however so far\r\n      from abating my desire only added fuel to the flame i\r\n      determined to go at all hazards and having made known my\r\n      intentions to augustus we set about arranging a plan by which it\r\n      might be accomplished in the meantime i forbore speaking to any\r\n      of my relations in regard to the voyage and as i busied myself\r\n      ostensibly with my usual studies it was supposed that i had\r\n      abandoned the design i have since frequently examined my conduct\r\n      on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of\r\n      surprise the intense hypocrisy i made use of for the furtherance\r\n      of my projectan hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my\r\n      life for so long a period of timecould only have been rendered\r\n      tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with\r\n      which i looked forward to the fulfilment of my longcherished\r\n      visions of travel\r\n\r\n      in pursuance of my scheme of deception i was necessarily obliged\r\n      to leave much to the management of augustus who was employed for\r\n      the greater part of every day on board the grampus attending to\r\n      some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold at\r\n      night however we were sure to have a conference and talk over\r\n      our hopes after nearly a month passed in this manner without\r\n      our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed he told\r\n      me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary i\r\n      had a relation living in new bedford a mr ross at whose house\r\n      i was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at\r\n      a time the brig was to sail about the middle of june june\r\n       and it was agreed that a day or two before her putting to\r\n      sea my father was to receive a note as usual from mr ross\r\n      asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with robert and\r\n      emmet his sons augustus charged himself with the inditing of\r\n      this note and getting it delivered having set out as supposed\r\n      for new bedford i was then to report myself to my companion who\r\n      would contrive a hidingplace for me in the grampus this\r\n      hidingplace he assured me would be rendered sufficiently\r\n      comfortable for a residence of many days during which i was not\r\n      to make my appearance when the brig had proceeded so far on her\r\n      course as to make any turning back a matter out of question i\r\n      should then he said be formally installed in all the comforts\r\n      of the cabin and as to his father he would only laugh heartily\r\n      at the joke vessels enough would be met with by which a letter\r\n      might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents\r\n\r\n      the middle of june at length arrived and every thing had been\r\n      matured the note was written and delivered and on a monday\r\n      morning i left the house for the new bedford packet as supposed\r\n      i went however straight to augustus who was waiting for me at\r\n      the corner of a street it had been our original plan that i\r\n      should keep out of the way until dark and then slip on board the\r\n      brig but as there was now a thick fog in our favor it was\r\n      agreed to lose no time in secreting me augustus led the way to\r\n      the wharf and i followed at a little distance enveloped in a\r\n      thick seamans cloak which he had brought with him so that my\r\n      person might not be easily recognized just as we turned the\r\n      second corner after passing mr edmunds well who should\r\n      appear standing right in front of me and looking me full in the\r\n      face but old mr peterson my grandfather why bless my soul\r\n      gordon said he after a long pause why whywhose dirty\r\n      cloak is that you have on sir i replied assuming as well\r\n      as i could in the exigency of the moment an air of offended\r\n      surprise and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable\r\n      tonessir you are a summat mistakenmy name in the first\r\n      place beent nothing at all like goddin and id want you for to\r\n      know better you blackguard than to call my new obercoat a darty\r\n      one for my life i could hardly refrain from screaming with\r\n      laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received\r\n      this handsome rebuke he started back two or three steps turned\r\n      first pale and then excessively red threw up his spectacles\r\n      then putting them down ran full tilt at me with his umbrella\r\n      uplifted he stopped short however in his career as if struck\r\n      with a sudden recollection and presently turning round hobbled\r\n      off down the street shaking all the while with rage and\r\n      muttering between his teeth wont donew glassesthought it was\r\n      gordondd goodfornothing salt water long tom\r\n\r\n      after this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution and\r\n      arrived at our point of destination in safety there were only\r\n      one or two of the hands on board and these were busy forward\r\n      doing something to the forecastle combings captain barnard we\r\n      knew very well was engaged at lloyd and vredenburghs and would\r\n      remain there until late in the evening so we had little to\r\n      apprehend on his account augustus went first up the vessels\r\n      side and in a short while i followed him without being noticed\r\n      by the men at work we proceeded at once into the cabin and\r\n      found no person there it was fitted up in the most comfortable\r\n      stylea thing somewhat unusual in a whalingvessel there were\r\n      four very excellent staterooms with wide and convenient berths\r\n      there was also a large stove i took notice and a remarkably\r\n      thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin\r\n      and staterooms the ceiling was full seven feet high and in\r\n      short every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature\r\n      than i had anticipated augustus however would allow me but\r\n      little time for observation insisting upon the necessity of my\r\n      concealing myself as soon as possible he led the way into his\r\n      own stateroom which was on the starboard side of the brig and\r\n      next to the bulkheads upon entering he closed the door and\r\n      bolted it i thought i had never seen a nicer little room than\r\n      the one in which i now found myself it was about ten feet long\r\n      and had only one berth which as i said before was wide and\r\n      convenient in that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads\r\n      there was a space of four feet square containing a table a\r\n      chair and a set of hanging shelves full of books chiefly books\r\n      of voyages and travels there were many other little comforts in\r\n      the room among which i ought not to forget a kind of safe or\r\n      refrigerator in which augustus pointed out to me a host of\r\n      delicacies both in the eating and drinking department\r\n\r\n      he now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the\r\n      carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned letting me know\r\n      that a portion of the flooring about sixteen inches square had\r\n      been neatly cut out and again adjusted as he pressed this\r\n      portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of\r\n      his finger beneath in this manner he raised the mouth of the\r\n      trap to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks and i\r\n      found that it led into the after hold he next lit a small taper\r\n      by means of a phosphorous match and placing the light in a dark\r\n      lantern descended with it through the opening bidding me\r\n      follow i did so and he then pulled the cover upon the hole by\r\n      means of a nail driven into the under sidethe carpet of course\r\n      resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom and\r\n      all traces of the aperture being concealed\r\n\r\n      the taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest\r\n      difficulty i could grope my way through the confused mass of\r\n      lumber among which i now found myself by degrees however my\r\n      eyes became accustomed to the gloom and i proceeded with less\r\n      trouble holding on to the skirts of my friends coat he brought\r\n      me at length after creeping and winding through innumerable\r\n      narrow passages to an ironbound box such as is used sometimes\r\n      for packing fine earthenware it was nearly four feet high and\r\n      full six long but very narrow two large empty oilcasks lay on\r\n      the top of it and above these again a vast quantity of straw\r\n      matting piled up as high as the floor of the cabin in every\r\n      other direction around was wedged as closely as possible even up\r\n      to the ceiling a complete chaos of almost every species of\r\n      shipfurniture together with a heterogeneous medley of crates\r\n      hampers barrels and bales so that it seemed a matter no less\r\n      than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the\r\n      box i afterward found that augustus had purposely arranged the\r\n      stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough\r\n      concealment having had only one assistant in the labour a man\r\n      not going out in the brig\r\n\r\n      my companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could\r\n      be removed at pleasure he slipped it aside and displayed the\r\n      interior at which i was excessively amused a mattress from one\r\n      of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom and it\r\n      contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be\r\n      crowded into so small a space allowing me at the same time\r\n      sufficient room for my accommodation either in a sitting\r\n      position or lying at full length among other things there were\r\n      some books pen ink and paper three blankets a large jug full\r\n      of water a keg of seabiscuit three or four immense bologna\r\n      sausages an enormous ham a cold leg of roast mutton and half a\r\n      dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs i proceeded immediately\r\n      to take possession of my little apartment and this with feelings\r\n      of higher satisfaction i am sure than any monarch ever\r\n      experienced upon entering a new palace augustus now pointed out\r\n      to me the method of fastening the open end of the box and then\r\n      holding the taper close to the deck showed me a piece of dark\r\n      whipcord lying along it this he said extended from my\r\n      hidingplace throughout all the necessary windings among the\r\n      lumber to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold\r\n      immediately beneath the trapdoor leading into his stateroom by\r\n      means of this cord i should be enabled readily to trace my way\r\n      out without his guidance provided any unlookedfor accident\r\n      should render such a step necessary he now took his departure\r\n      leaving with me the lantern together with a copious supply of\r\n      tapers and phosphorous and promising to pay me a visit as often\r\n      as he could contrive to do so without observation this was on\r\n      the seventeenth of june\r\n\r\n      i remained three days and nights as nearly as i could guess in\r\n      my hidingplace without getting out of it at all except twice\r\n      for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between\r\n      two crates just opposite the opening during the whole period i\r\n      saw nothing of augustus but this occasioned me little\r\n      uneasiness as i knew the brig was expected to put to sea every\r\n      hour and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of\r\n      coming down to me at length i heard the trap open and shut and\r\n      presently he called in a low voice asking if all was well and\r\n      if there was any thing i wanted nothing i replied i am as\r\n      comfortable as can be when will the brig sail she will be\r\n      under weigh in less than half an hour he answered i came to\r\n      let you know and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence i\r\n      shall not have a chance of coming down again for some\r\n      timeperhaps for three or four days more all is going on right\r\n      aboveboard after i go up and close the trap do you creep along\r\n      by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in you will find my\r\n      watch thereit may be useful to you as you have no daylight to\r\n      keep time by i suppose you cant tell how long you have been\r\n      buriedonly three daysthis is the twentieth i would bring the\r\n      watch to your box but am afraid of being missed with this he\r\n      went up\r\n\r\n      in about an hour after he had gone i distinctly felt the brig in\r\n      motion and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly\r\n      commenced a voyage satisfied with this idea i determined to\r\n      make my mind as easy as possible and await the course of events\r\n      until i should be permitted to exchange the box for the more\r\n      roomy although hardly more comfortable accommodations of the\r\n      cabin my first care was to get the watch leaving the taper\r\n      burning i groped along in the dark following the cord through\r\n      windings innumerable in some of which i discovered that after\r\n      toiling a long distance i was brought back within a foot or two\r\n      of a former position at length i reached the nail and securing\r\n      the object of my journey returned with it in safety i now\r\n      looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided\r\n      and selected the expedition of lewis and clarke to the mouth of\r\n      the columbia with this i amused myself for some time when\r\n      growing sleepy i extinguished the light with great care and\r\n      soon fell into a sound slumber\r\n\r\n      upon awakening i felt strangely confused in mind and some time\r\n      elapsed before i could bring to recollection all the various\r\n      circumstances of my situation by degrees however i remembered\r\n      all striking a light i looked at the watch but it was run\r\n      down and there were consequently no means of determining how\r\n      long i slept my limbs were greatly cramped and i was forced to\r\n      relieve them by standing between the crates presently feeling an\r\n      almost ravenous appetite i bethought myself of the cold mutton\r\n      some of which i had eaten just before going to sleep and found\r\n      excellent what was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a\r\n      state of absolute putrefaction this circumstance occasioned me\r\n      great disquietude for connecting it with the disorder of mind i\r\n      experienced upon awakening i began to suppose that i must have\r\n      slept for an inordinately long period of time the close\r\n      atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this\r\n      and might in the end be productive of the most serious results\r\n      my head ached excessively i fancied that i drew every breath\r\n      with difficulty and in short i was oppressed with a multitude\r\n      of gloomy feelings still i could not venture to make any\r\n      disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise and having wound\r\n      up the watch contented myself as well as possible\r\n\r\n      throughout the whole of the next tedious twentyfour hours no\r\n      person came to my relief and i could not help accusing augustus\r\n      of the grossest inattention what alarmed me chiefly was that\r\n      the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint and i was\r\n      suffering much from thirst having eaten freely of the bologna\r\n      sausages after the loss of my mutton i became very uneasy and\r\n      could no longer take any interest in my books i was overpowered\r\n      too with a desire to sleep yet trembled at the thought of\r\n      indulging it lest there might exist some pernicious influence\r\n      like that of burning charcoal in the confined air of the hold\r\n      in the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in\r\n      the main ocean and a dull humming sound which reached my ears\r\n      as if from an immense distance convinced me no ordinary gale was\r\n      blowing i could not imagine a reason for the absence of\r\n      augustus we were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to\r\n      allow of my going up some accident might have happened to\r\n      himbut i could think of none which would account for his\r\n      suffering me to remain so long a prisoner except indeed his\r\n      having suddenly died or fallen overboard and upon this idea i\r\n      could not dwell with any degree of patience it was possible that\r\n      we had been baffled by head winds and were still in the near\r\n      vicinity of nantucket this notion however i was forced to\r\n      abandon for such being the case the brig must have frequently\r\n      gone about and i was entirely satisfied from her continual\r\n      inclination to the larboard that she had been sailing all along\r\n      with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter besides granting\r\n      that we were still in the neighborhood of the island why should\r\n      not augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance\r\n      pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and\r\n      cheerless condition i resolved to wait yet another twentyfour\r\n      hours when if no relief were obtained i would make my way to\r\n      the trap and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend\r\n      or get at least a little fresh air through the opening and a\r\n      further supply of water from the stateroom while occupied with\r\n      this thought however i fell in spite of every exertion to the\r\n      contrary into a state of profound sleep or rather stupor my\r\n      dreams were of the most terrific description every species of\r\n      calamity and horror befell me among other miseries i was\r\n      smothered to death between huge pillows by demons of the most\r\n      ghastly and ferocious aspect immense serpents held me in their\r\n      embrace and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully\r\n      shining eyes then deserts limitless and of the most forlorn\r\n      and aweinspiring character spread themselves out before me\r\n      immensely tall trunks of trees gray and leafless rose up in\r\n      endless succession as far as the eye could reach their roots\r\n      were concealed in widespreading morasses whose dreary water lay\r\n      intensely black still and altogether terrible beneath and the\r\n      strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality and waving to\r\n      and fro their skeleton arms were crying to the silent waters for\r\n      mercy in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony\r\n      and despair the scene changed and i stood naked and alone\r\n      amidst the burning sandplains of sahara at my feet lay crouched\r\n      a fierce lion of the tropics suddenly his wild eyes opened and\r\n      fell upon me with a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet and\r\n      laid bare his horrible teeth in another instant there burst from\r\n      his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament and i\r\n      fell impetuously to the earth stifling in a paroxysm of terror\r\n      i at last found myself partially awake my dream then was not\r\n      all a dream now at least i was in possession of my senses the\r\n      paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my\r\n      bosomhis hot breath was in my earand his white and ghastly\r\n      fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom\r\n\r\n      had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the\r\n      utterance of a syllable i could have neither stirred nor spoken\r\n      the beast whatever it was retained his position without\r\n      attempting any immediate violence while i lay in an utterly\r\n      helpless and i fancied a dying condition beneath him i felt\r\n      that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving mein a word\r\n      that i was perishing and perishing of sheer fright my brain\r\n      swami grew deadly sickmy vision failedeven the glaring\r\n      eyeballs above me grew dim making a last strong effort i at\r\n      length breathed a faint ejaculation to god and resigned myself\r\n      to die the sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent\r\n      fury of the animal he precipitated himself at full length upon\r\n      my body but what was my astonishment when with a long and low\r\n      whine he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest\r\n      eagerness and with the most extravagant demonstration of\r\n      affection and joy i was bewildered utterly lost in\r\n      amazementbut i could not forget the peculiar whine of my\r\n      newfoundland dog tiger and the odd manner of his caresses i well\r\n      knew it was he i experienced a sudden rush of blood to my\r\n      templesa giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and\r\n      reanimation i rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which i had\r\n      been lying and throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful\r\n      follower and friend relieved the long oppression of my bosom in\r\n      a flood of the most passionate tears\r\n\r\n      as upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the\r\n      greatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress\r\n      for a long time i found it nearly impossible to connect any\r\n      ideas but by very slow degrees my thinking faculties returned\r\n      and i again called to memory the several incidents of my\r\n      condition for the presence of tiger i tried in vain to account\r\n      and after busying myself with a thousand different conjectures\r\n      respecting him was forced to content myself with rejoicing that\r\n      he was with me to share my dreary solitude and render me comfort\r\n      by his caresses most people love their dogsbut for tiger i had\r\n      an affection far more ardent than common and never certainly\r\n      did any creature more truly deserve it for seven years he had\r\n      been my inseparable companion and in a multitude of instances\r\n      had given evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value\r\n      the animal i had rescued him when a puppy from the clutches of\r\n      a malignant little villain in nantucket who was leading him with\r\n      a rope around his neck to the water and the grown dog repaid\r\n      the obligation about three years afterward by saving me from\r\n      the bludgeon of a street robber\r\n\r\n      getting now hold of the watch i found upon applying it to my\r\n      ear that it had again run down but at this i was not at all\r\n      surprised being convinced from the peculiar state of my\r\n      feelings that i had slept as before for a very long period of\r\n      time how long it was of course impossible to say i was burning\r\n      up with fever and my thirst was almost intolerable i felt about\r\n      the box for my little remaining supply of water for i had no\r\n      light the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern and\r\n      the phosphorusbox not coming readily to hand upon finding the\r\n      jug however i discovered it to be emptytiger no doubt having\r\n      been tempted to drink it as well as to devour the remnant of\r\n      mutton the bone of which lay well picked by the opening of the\r\n      box the spoiled meat i could well spare but my heart sank as i\r\n      thought of the water i was feeble in the extremeso much so that\r\n      i shook all over as with an ague at the slightest movement or\r\n      exertion to add to my troubles the brig was pitching and\r\n      rolling with great violence and the oilcasks which lay upon my\r\n      box were in momentary danger of falling down so as to block up\r\n      the only way of ingress or egress i felt also terrible\r\n      sufferings from seasickness these considerations determined me\r\n      to make my way at all hazards to the trap and obtain immediate\r\n      relief before i should be incapacitated from doing so\r\n      altogether having come to this resolve i again felt about for\r\n      the phosphorusbox and tapers the former i found after some\r\n      little trouble but not discovering the tapers as soon as i had\r\n      expected for i remembered very nearly the spot in which i had\r\n      placed them i gave up the search for the present and bidding\r\n      tiger lie quiet began at once my journey toward the trap\r\n\r\n      in this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever\r\n      apparent it was with the utmost difficulty i could crawl along\r\n      at all and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath\r\n      me when falling prostrate on my face i would remain for some\r\n      minutes in a state bordering on insensibility still i struggled\r\n      forward by slow degrees dreading every moment that i should\r\n      swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber in\r\n      which event i had nothing but death to expect as the result at\r\n      length upon making a push forward with all the energy i could\r\n      command i struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner\r\n      of an ironbound crate the accident only stunned me for a few\r\n      moments but i found to my inexpressible grief that the quick\r\n      and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely\r\n      across my path so as effectually to block up the passage with\r\n      my utmost exertions i could not move it a single inch from its\r\n      position it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes\r\n      and shipfurniture it became necessary therefore enfeebled as\r\n      i was either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out\r\n      a new passage or to climb over the obstacle and resume the path\r\n      on the other side the former alternative presented too many\r\n      difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder in\r\n      my present weak state of both mind and body i should infallibly\r\n      lose my way if i attempted it and perish miserably amid the\r\n      dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold i proceeded\r\n      therefore without hesitation to summon up all my remaining\r\n      strength and fortitude and endeavour as i best might to\r\n      clamber over the crate\r\n\r\n      upon standing erect with this end in view i found the\r\n      undertaking even a more serious task than my fears had led me to\r\n      imagine on each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall\r\n      of various heavy lumber which the least blunder on my part might\r\n      be the means of bringing down upon my head or if this accident\r\n      did not occur the path might be effectually blocked up against\r\n      my return by the descending mass as it was in front by the\r\n      obstacle there the crate itself was a long and unwieldy box\r\n      upon which no foothold could be obtained in vain i attempted by\r\n      every means in my power to reach the top with the hope of being\r\n      thus enabled to draw myself up had i succeeded in reaching it\r\n      it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly\r\n      inadequate to the task of getting over and it was better in\r\n      every respect that i failed at length in a desperate effort to\r\n      force the crate from its ground i felt a strong vibration in the\r\n      side next me i thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks\r\n      and found that a very large one was loose with my pocketknife\r\n      which luckily i had with me i succeeded after great labour\r\n      in prying it entirely off and getting it through the aperture\r\n      discovered to my exceeding joy that there were no boards on the\r\n      opposite sidein other words that the top was wanting it being\r\n      the bottom through which i had forced my way i now met with no\r\n      important difficulty in proceeding along the line until i finally\r\n      reached the nail with a beating heart i stood erect and with a\r\n      gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap it did not\r\n      rise as soon as i had expected and i pressed it with somewhat\r\n      more determination still dreading lest some other person than\r\n      augustus might be in his stateroom the door however to my\r\n      astonishment remained steady and i became somewhat uneasy for\r\n      i knew that it had formerly required but little or no effort to\r\n      remove it i pushed it stronglyit was nevertheless firm with\r\n      all my strengthit still did not give way with rage with fury\r\n      with despairit set at defiance my utmost efforts and it was\r\n      evident from the unyielding nature of the resistance that the\r\n      hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up or\r\n      that some immense weight had been placed upon it which it was\r\n      useless to think of removing\r\n\r\n      my sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay in vain i\r\n      attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus\r\n      entombed i could summon up no connected chain of reflection\r\n      and sinking on the floor gave way unresistingly to the most\r\n      gloomy imaginings in which the dreadful deaths of thirst\r\n      famine suffocation and premature interment crowded upon me as\r\n      the prominent disasters to be encountered at length there\r\n      returned to me some portion of presence of mind i arose and\r\n      felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture\r\n      having found them i examined them closely to ascertain if they\r\n      emitted any light from the stateroom but none was visible i\r\n      then forced the blade of my penknife through them until i met\r\n      with some hard obstacle scraping against it i discovered it to\r\n      be a solid mass of iron which from its peculiar wavy feel as i\r\n      passed the blade along it i concluded to be a chaincable the\r\n      only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box and\r\n      there either yield to my sad fate or try so to tranquilize my\r\n      mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape i\r\n      immediately set about the attempt and succeeded after\r\n      innumerable difficulties in getting back as i sank utterly\r\n      exhausted upon the mattress tiger threw himself at full length\r\n      by my side and seemed as if desirous by his caresses of\r\n      consoling me in my troubles and urging me to bear them with\r\n      fortitude\r\n\r\n      the singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my\r\n      attention after licking my face and hands for some minutes he\r\n      would suddenly cease doing so and utter a low whine upon\r\n      reaching out my hand toward him i then invariably found him\r\n      lying on his back with his paws uplifted this conduct so\r\n      frequently repeated appeared strange and i could in no manner\r\n      account for it as the dog seemed distressed i concluded that he\r\n      had received some injury and taking his paws in my hands i\r\n      examined them one by one but found no sign of any hurt i then\r\n      supposed him hungry and gave him a large piece of ham which he\r\n      devoured with avidityafterward however resuming his\r\n      extraordinary manoeuvres i now imagined that he was suffering\r\n      like myself the torments of thirst and was about adopting this\r\n      conclusion as the true one when the idea occurred to me that i\r\n      had as yet only examined his paws and that there might possibly\r\n      be a wound upon some portion of his body or head the latter i\r\n      felt carefully over but found nothing on passing my hand\r\n      however along his back i perceived a slight erection of the\r\n      hair extending completely across it probing this with my finger\r\n      i discovered a string and tracing it up found that it encircled\r\n      the whole body upon a closer scrutiny i came across a small\r\n      slip of what had the feeling of letter paper through which the\r\n      string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it\r\n      immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      the thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note\r\n      from augustus and that some unaccountable accident having\r\n      happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon he had\r\n      devised this method of acquainting me with the true state of\r\n      affairs trembling with eagerness i now commenced another search\r\n      for my phosphorus matches and tapers i had a confused\r\n      recollection of having put them carefully away just before\r\n      falling asleep and indeed previously to my last journey to the\r\n      trap i had been able to remember the exact spot where i had\r\n      deposited them but now i endeavored in vain to call it to mind\r\n      and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious\r\n      search for the missing articles never surely was there a more\r\n      tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense at length while\r\n      groping about with my head close to the ballast near the\r\n      opening of the box and outside of it i perceived a faint\r\n      glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage greatly\r\n      surprised i endeavored to make my way toward it as it appeared\r\n      to be but a few feet from my position scarcely had i moved with\r\n      this intention when i lost sight of the glimmer entirely and\r\n      before i could bring it into view again was obliged to feel\r\n      along by the box until i had exactly resumed my original\r\n      situation now moving my head with caution to and fro i found\r\n      that by proceeding slowly with great care in an opposite\r\n      direction to that in which i had at first started i was enabled\r\n      to draw near the light still keeping it in view presently i\r\n      came directly upon it having squeezed my way through innumerable\r\n      narrow windings and found that it proceeded from some fragments\r\n      of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side i\r\n      was wondering how they came in such a place when my hand fell\r\n      upon two or three pieces of taper wax which had been evidently\r\n      mumbled by the dog i concluded at once that he had devoured the\r\n      whole of my supply of candles and i felt hopeless of being ever\r\n      able to read the note of augustus the small remnants of the wax\r\n      were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel that i\r\n      despaired of deriving any service from them and left them as\r\n      they were the phosphorus of which there was only a speck or\r\n      two i gathered up as well as i could and returned with it\r\n      after much difficulty to my box where tiger had all the while\r\n      remained\r\n\r\n      what to do next i could not tell the hold was so intensely dark\r\n      that i could not see my hand however close i would hold it to my\r\n      face the white slip of paper could barely be discerned and not\r\n      even that when i looked at it directly by turning the exterior\r\n      portions of the retina toward itthat is to say by surveying it\r\n      slightly askance i found that it became in some measure\r\n      perceptible thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined and the\r\n      note of my friend if indeed it were a note from him seemed only\r\n      likely to throw me into further trouble by disquieting to no\r\n      purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind in vain i\r\n      revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for\r\n      procuring lightsuch expedients precisely as a man in the\r\n      perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for\r\n      a similar purposeeach and all of which appear by turns to the\r\n      dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of\r\n      conceptions just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties\r\n      flicker alternately one above the other at last an idea\r\n      occurred to me which seemed rational and which gave me cause to\r\n      wonder very justly that i had not entertained it before i\r\n      placed the slip of paper on the back of a book and collecting\r\n      the fragments of the phosphorus matches which i had brought from\r\n      the barrel laid them together upon the paper i then with the\r\n      palm of my hand rubbed the whole over quickly yet steadily a\r\n      clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole\r\n      surface and had there been any writing upon it i should not\r\n      have experienced the least difficulty i am sure in reading it\r\n      not a syllable was there howevernothing but a dreary and\r\n      unsatisfactory blank the illumination died away in a few\r\n      seconds and my heart died away within me as it went\r\n\r\n      i have before stated more than once that my intellect for some\r\n      period prior to this had been in a condition nearly bordering on\r\n      idiocy there were to be sure momentary intervals of perfect\r\n      sanity and now and then even of energy but these were few it\r\n      must be remembered that i had been for many days certainly\r\n      inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a\r\n      whaling vessel and for a long portion of that time but scantily\r\n      supplied with water for the last fourteen or fifteen hours i had\r\n      nonenor had i slept during that time salt provisions of the\r\n      most exciting kind had been my chief and indeed since the loss\r\n      of the mutton my only supply of food with the exception of the\r\n      seabiscuit and these latter were utterly useless to me as they\r\n      were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched\r\n      condition of my throat i was now in a high state of fever and\r\n      in every respect exceedingly ill this will account for the fact\r\n      that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last\r\n      adventure with the phosphorus before the thought suggested\r\n      itself that i had examined only one side of the paper i shall\r\n      not attempt to describe my feelings of rage for i believe i was\r\n      more angry than any thing else when the egregious oversight i\r\n      had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception the blunder\r\n      itself would have been unimportant had not my own folly and\r\n      impetuosity rendered it otherwisein my disappointment at not\r\n      finding some words upon the slip i had childishly torn it in\r\n      pieces and thrown it away it was impossible to say where\r\n\r\n      from the worst part of this dilemma i was relieved by the\r\n      sagacity of tiger having got after a long search a small piece\r\n      of the note i put it to the dogs nose and endeavored to make\r\n      him understand that he must bring me the rest of it to my\r\n      astonishment for i had taught him none of the usual tricks for\r\n      which his breed are famous he seemed to enter at once into my\r\n      meaning and rummaging about for a few moments soon found\r\n      another considerable portion bringing me this he paused awhile\r\n      and rubbing his nose against my hand appeared to be waiting for\r\n      my approval of what he had done i patted him on the head when\r\n      he immediately made off again it was now some minutes before he\r\n      came backbut when he did come he brought with him a large slip\r\n      which proved to be all the paper missingit having been torn it\r\n      seems only into three pieces luckily i had no trouble in\r\n      finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were leftbeing\r\n      guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still\r\n      emitted my difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution\r\n      and i now took time to reflect upon what i was about to do it\r\n      was very probable i considered that some words were written\r\n      upon that side of the paper which had not been examinedbut which\r\n      side was that fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in\r\n      this respect although it assured me that the words if there\r\n      were any would be found all on one side and connected in a\r\n      proper manner as written there was the greater necessity of\r\n      ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt as the\r\n      phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third\r\n      attempt should i fail in the one i was now about to make i\r\n      placed the paper on a book as before and sat for some minutes\r\n      thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind at last i\r\n      thought it barely possible that the written side might have some\r\n      unevenness on its surface which a delicate sense of feeling\r\n      might enable me to detect i determined to make the experiment\r\n      and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first\r\n      presented itself nothing however was perceptible and i turned\r\n      the paper adjusting it on the book i now again carried my\r\n      forefinger cautiously along when i was aware of an exceedingly\r\n      slight but still discernable glow which followed as it\r\n      proceeded this i knew must arise from some very minute\r\n      remaining particles of the phosphorus with which i had covered\r\n      the paper in my previous attempt the other or under side then\r\n      was that on which lay the writing if writing there should\r\n      finally prove to be again i turned the note and went to work as\r\n      i had previously done having rubbed in the phosphorus a\r\n      brilliancy ensued as beforebut this time several lines of ms in\r\n      a large hand and apparently in red ink became distinctly\r\n      visible the glimmer although sufficiently bright was but\r\n      momentary still had i not been too greatly excited there would\r\n      have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three\r\n      sentences before mefor i saw there were three in my anxiety\r\n      however to read all at once i succeeded only in reading the\r\n      seven concluding words which thus appearedbloodyour life\r\n      depends upon lying close\r\n\r\n      had i been able to ascertain the entire contents of the notethe\r\n      full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted\r\n      to convey that admonition even although it should have revealed\r\n      a story of disaster the most unspeakable could not i am firmly\r\n      convinced have imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing\r\n      and yet indefinable horror with which i was inspired by the\r\n      fragmentary warning thus received and blood too that word of\r\n      all wordsso rife at all times with mystery and suffering and\r\n      terrorhow trebly full of import did it now appearhow chilly and\r\n      heavily disjointed as it thus was from any foregoing words to\r\n      qualify or render it distinct did its vague syllables fall amid\r\n      the deep gloom of my prison into the innermost recesses of my\r\n      soul\r\n\r\n      augustus had undoubtedly good reasons for wishing me to remain\r\n      concealed and i formed a thousand surmises as to what they could\r\n      bebut i could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution\r\n      of the mystery just after returning from my last journey to the\r\n      trap and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the\r\n      singular conduct of tiger i had come to the resolution of making\r\n      myself heard at all events by those on board or if i could not\r\n      succeed in this directly of trying to cut my way through the\r\n      orlop deck the half certainty which i felt of being able to\r\n      accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency had\r\n      given me courage which i should not otherwise have had to\r\n      endure the evils of my situation the few words i had been able\r\n      to read however had cut me off from these final resources and\r\n      i now for the first time felt all the misery of my fate in a\r\n      paroxysm of despair i threw myself again upon the mattress\r\n      where for about the period of a day and night i lay in a kind\r\n      of stupor relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and\r\n      recollection\r\n\r\n      at length i once more arose and busied myself in reflection upon\r\n      the horrors which encompassed me for another twentyfour hours\r\n      it was barely possible that i might exist without waterfor a\r\n      longer time i could not do so during the first portion of my\r\n      imprisonment i had made free use of the cordials with which\r\n      augustus had supplied me but they only served to excite fever\r\n      without in the least degree assuaging thirst i had now only\r\n      about a gill left and this was of a species of strong peach\r\n      liqueur at which my stomach revolted the sausages were entirely\r\n      consumed of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the\r\n      skin and all the biscuit except a few fragments of one had\r\n      been eaten by tiger to add to my troubles i found that my\r\n      headache was increasing momentarily and with it the species of\r\n      delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first\r\n      falling asleep for some hours past it had been with the greatest\r\n      difficulty i could breathe at all and now each attempt at so\r\n      doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic action of\r\n      the chest but there was still another and very different source\r\n      of disquietude and one indeed whose harassing terrors had been\r\n      the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the\r\n      mattress it arose from the demeanor of the dog\r\n\r\n      i first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in\r\n      the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt as i rubbed he\r\n      ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl but i was too\r\n      greatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the\r\n      circumstance soon afterward it will be remembered i threw\r\n      myself on the mattress and fell into a species of lethargy\r\n      presently i became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my\r\n      ears and discovered it to proceed from tiger who was panting\r\n      and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement his\r\n      eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom i spoke to him\r\n      when he replied with a low growl and then remained quiet\r\n      presently i relapsed into my stupor from which i was again\r\n      awakened in a similar manner this was repeated three or four\r\n      times until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a\r\n      degree of fear that i became fully aroused he was now lying\r\n      close by the door of the box snarling fearfully although in a\r\n      kind of undertone and grinding his teeth as if strongly\r\n      convulsed i had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the\r\n      confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad and i was at\r\n      a loss what course to pursue i could not endure the thought of\r\n      killing him yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own\r\n      safety i could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me\r\n      with an expression of the most deadly animosity and i expected\r\n      every instant that he would attack me at last i could endure my\r\n      terrible situation no longer and determined to make my way from\r\n      the box at all hazards and dispatch him if his opposition\r\n      should render it necessary for me to do so to get out i had to\r\n      pass directly over his body and he already seemed to anticipate\r\n      my designmissing himself upon his forelegs as i perceived by\r\n      the altered position of his eyes and displayed the whole of his\r\n      white fangs which were easily discernible i took the remains of\r\n      the hamskin and the bottle containing the liqueur and secured\r\n      them about my person together with a large carvingknife which\r\n      augustus had left methen folding my cloak around me as closely\r\n      as possible i made a movement toward the mouth of the box no\r\n      sooner did i do this than the dog sprang with a loud growl\r\n      toward my throat the whole weight of his body struck me on the\r\n      right shoulder and i fell violently to the left while the\r\n      enraged animal passed entirely over me i had fallen upon my\r\n      knees with my head buried among the blankets and these\r\n      protected me from a second furious assault during which i felt\r\n      the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which\r\n      enveloped my neckyet luckily without being able to penetrate\r\n      all the folds i was now beneath the dog and a few moments would\r\n      place me completely in his power despair gave me strength and i\r\n      rose boldly up shaking him from me by main force and dragging\r\n      with me the blankets from the mattress these i now threw over\r\n      him and before he could extricate himself i had got through the\r\n      door and closed it effectually against his pursuit in this\r\n      struggle however i had been forced to drop the morsel of\r\n      hamskin and i now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to\r\n      a single gill of liqueur as this reflection crossed my mind i\r\n      felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which\r\n      might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar\r\n      circumstances and raising the bottle to my lips i drained it\r\n      to the last drop and dashed it furiously upon the floor\r\n\r\n      scarcely had the echo of the crash died away when i heard my\r\n      name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice issuing from the\r\n      direction of the steerage so unexpected was anything of the\r\n      kind and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the\r\n      sound that i endeavoured in vain to reply my powers of speech\r\n      totally failed and in an agony of terror lest my friend should\r\n      conclude me dead and return without attempting to reach me i\r\n      stood up between the crates near the door of the box trembling\r\n      convulsively and gasping and struggling for utterance had a\r\n      thousand words depended upon a syllable i could not have spoken\r\n      it there was a slight movement now audible among the lumber\r\n      somewhere forward of my station the sound presently grew less\r\n      distinct then again less so and still less shall i ever forget\r\n      my feelings at this moment he was goingmy friend my companion\r\n      from whom i had a right to expect so muchhe was goinghe would\r\n      abandon mehe was gone he would leave me to perish miserably to\r\n      expire in the most horrible and loathesome of dungeonsand one\r\n      word one little syllable would save meyet that single syllable\r\n      i could not utter i felt i am sure more than ten thousand\r\n      times the agonies of death itself my brain reeled and i fell\r\n      deadly sick against the end of the box\r\n\r\n      as i fell the carvingknife was shaken out from the waistband of\r\n      my pantaloons and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor\r\n      never did any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my\r\n      ears with the intensest anxiety i listened to ascertain the\r\n      effect of the noise upon augustusfor i knew that the person who\r\n      called my name could be no one but himself all was silent for\r\n      some moments at length i again heard the word arthur repeated\r\n      in a low tone and one full of hesitation reviving hope loosened\r\n      at once my powers of speech and i now screamed at the top of my\r\n      voice augustus oh augustus hush for gods sake be\r\n      silent he replied in a voice trembling with agitation i will\r\n      be with you immediatelyas soon as i can make my way through the\r\n      hold for a long time i heard him moving among the lumber and\r\n      every moment seemed to me an age at length i felt his hand upon\r\n      my shoulder and he placed at the same moment a bottle of water\r\n      to my lips those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the\r\n      jaws of the tomb or who have known the insufferable torments of\r\n      thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which\r\n      encompassed me in my dreary prison can form any idea of the\r\n      unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest\r\n      of all physical luxuries afforded\r\n\r\n      when i had in some degree satisfied my thirst augustus produced\r\n      from his pocket three or four boiled potatoes which i devoured\r\n      with the greatest avidity he had brought with him a light in a\r\n      dark lantern and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less\r\n      comfort than the food and drink but i was impatient to learn the\r\n      cause of his protracted absence and he proceeded to recount what\r\n      had happened on board during my incarceration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      the brig put to sea as i had supposed in about an hour after he\r\n      had left the watch this was on the twentieth of june it will be\r\n      remembered that i had then been in the hold for three days and\r\n      during this period there was so constant a bustle on board and\r\n      so much running to and fro especially in the cabin and\r\n      staterooms that he had had no chance of visiting me without the\r\n      risk of having the secret of the trap discovered when at length\r\n      he did come i had assured him that i was doing as well as\r\n      possible and therefore for the two next days he felt but\r\n      little uneasiness on my accountstill however watching an\r\n      opportunity of going down it was not until the fourth day that\r\n      he found one several times during this interval he had made up\r\n      his mind to let his father know of the adventure and have me\r\n      come up at once but we were still within reaching distance of\r\n      nantucket and it was doubtful from some expressions which had\r\n      escaped captain barnard whether he would not immediately put\r\n      back if he discovered me to be on board besides upon thinking\r\n      the matter over augustus so he told me could not imagine that\r\n      i was in immediate want or that i would hesitate in such case\r\n      to make myself heard at the trap when therefore he considered\r\n      everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with\r\n      an opportunity of visiting me unobserved this as i said before\r\n      did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the\r\n      watch and the seventh since i had first entered the hold he\r\n      then went down without taking with him any water or provisions\r\n      intending in the first place merely to call my attention and get\r\n      me to come from the box to the trapwhen he would go up to the\r\n      stateroom and thence hand me down a supply when he descended for\r\n      this purpose he found that i was asleep for it seems that i was\r\n      snoring very loudly from all the calculations i can make on the\r\n      subject this must have been the slumber into which i fell just\r\n      after my return from the trap with the watch and which\r\n      consequently must have lasted for more than three entire days\r\n      and nights at the very least latterly i have had reason both\r\n      from my own experience and the assurance of others to be\r\n      acquainted with the strong soporific effects of the stench\r\n      arising from old fishoil when closely confined and when i think\r\n      of the condition of the hold in which i was imprisoned and the\r\n      long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling\r\n      vessel i am more inclined to wonder that i awoke at all after\r\n      once falling asleep than that i should have slept\r\n      uninterruptedly for the period specified above\r\n\r\n      augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing\r\n      the trapbut i made him no reply he then shut the trap and\r\n      spoke to me in a louder and finally in a very loud tonestill i\r\n      continued to snore he was now at a loss what to do it would\r\n      take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box\r\n      and in the meanwhile his absence would be noticed by captain\r\n      barnard who had occasion for his services every minute in\r\n      arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the\r\n      voyage he determined therefore upon reflection to ascend and\r\n      await another opportunity of visiting me he was the more easily\r\n      induced to this resolve as my slumber appeared to be of the most\r\n      tranquil nature and he could not suppose that i had undergone\r\n      any inconvenience from my incarceration he had just made up his\r\n      mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an\r\n      unusual bustle the sound of which proceeded apparently from the\r\n      cabin he sprang through the trap as quickly as possible closed\r\n      it and threw open the door of his stateroom no sooner had he\r\n      put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his\r\n      face and he was knocked down at the same moment by a blow from\r\n      a handspike\r\n\r\n      a strong hand held him on the cabin floor with a tight grasp\r\n      upon his throat still he was able to see what was going on\r\n      around him his father was tied hand and foot and lying along\r\n      the steps of the companionway with his head down and a deep\r\n      wound in the forehead from which the blood was flowing in a\r\n      continued stream he spoke not a word and was apparently dying\r\n      over him stood the first mate eyeing him with an expression of\r\n      fiendish derision and deliberately searching his pockets from\r\n      which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer\r\n      seven of the crew among whom was the cook a negro were\r\n      rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms where they\r\n      soon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition besides\r\n      augustus and captain barnard there were nine men altogether in\r\n      the cabin and these among the most ruffianly of the brigs\r\n      company the villains now went upon deck taking my friend with\r\n      them after having secured his arms behind his back they\r\n      proceeded straight to the forecastle which was fastened downtwo\r\n      of the mutineers standing by it with axestwo also at the main\r\n      hatch the mate called out in a loud voice do you hear there\r\n      below tumble up with you one by onenow mark thatand no\r\n      grumbling it was some minutes before any one appearedat last\r\n      an englishman who had shipped as a raw hand came up weeping\r\n      piteously and entreating the mate in the most humble manner to\r\n      spare his life the only reply was a blow on the forehead from an\r\n      axe the poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan and the\r\n      black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child and\r\n      tossed him deliberately into the sea hearing the blow and the\r\n      plunge of the body the men below could now be induced to venture\r\n      on deck neither by threats nor promises until a proposition was\r\n      made to smoke them out a general rush then ensued and for a\r\n      moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken the\r\n      mutineers however succeeded at last in closing the forecastle\r\n      effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up\r\n      these six finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without\r\n      arms submitted after a brief struggle the mate gave them fair\r\n      wordsno doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield for\r\n      they had no difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck the\r\n      result proved his sagacity no less than his diabolical villainy\r\n      all in the forecastle presently signified their intention of\r\n      submitting and ascending one by one were pinioned and then\r\n      thrown on their backs together with the first sixthere being in\r\n      all of the crew who were not concerned in the mutiny\r\n      twentyseven\r\n\r\n      a scene of the most horrible butchery ensued the bound seamen\r\n      were dragged to the gangway here the cook stood with an axe\r\n      striking each victim on the head as he was forced over the side\r\n      of the vessel by the other mutineers in this manner twentytwo\r\n      perished and augustus had given himself up for lost expecting\r\n      every moment his own turn to come next but it seemed that the\r\n      villains were now either weary or in some measure disgusted with\r\n      their bloody labour for the four remaining prisoners together\r\n      with my friend who had been thrown on the deck with the rest\r\n      were respited while the mate sent below for rum and the whole\r\n      murderous party held a drunken carouse which lasted until\r\n      sunset they now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the\r\n      survivors who lay not more than four paces off and could\r\n      distinguish every word said upon some of the mutineers the\r\n      liquor appeared to have a softening effect for several voices\r\n      were heard in favor of releasing the captives altogether on\r\n      condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits the\r\n      black cook however who in all respects was a perfect demon and\r\n      who seemed to exert as much influence if not more than the mate\r\n      himself would listen to no proposition of the kind and rose\r\n      repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway\r\n      fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be\r\n      easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party among\r\n      whom was a linemanager who went by the name of dirk peters\r\n      this man was the son of an indian squaw of the tribe of\r\n      upsarokas who live among the fastnesses of the black hills near\r\n      the source of the missouri his father was a furtrader i\r\n      believe or at least connected in some manner with the indian\r\n      tradingposts on lewis river peters himself was one of the most\r\n      ferociouslooking men i ever beheld he was short in stature not\r\n      more than four feet eight inches high but his limbs were of\r\n      herculean mould his hands especially were so enormously thick\r\n      and broad as hardly to retain a human shape his arms as well as\r\n      legs were bowed in the most singular manner and appeared to\r\n      possess no flexibility whatever his head was equally deformed\r\n      being of immense size with an indentation on the crown like\r\n      that on the head of most negroes and entirely bald to conceal\r\n      this latter deficiency which did not proceed from old age he\r\n      usually wore a wig formed of any hairlike material which\r\n      presented itselfoccasionally the skin of a spanish dog or\r\n      american grizzly bear at the time spoken of he had on a portion\r\n      of one of these bearskins and it added no little to the natural\r\n      ferocity of his countenance which betook of the upsaroka\r\n      character the mouth extended nearly from ear to ear the lips\r\n      were thin and seemed like some other portions of his frame to\r\n      be devoid of natural pliancy so that the ruling expression never\r\n      varied under the influence of any emotion whatever this ruling\r\n      expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth\r\n      were exceedingly long and protruding and never even partially\r\n      covered in any instance by the lips to pass this man with a\r\n      casual glance one might imagine him to be convulsed with\r\n      laughter but a second look would induce a shuddering\r\n      acknowledgment that if such an expression were indicative of\r\n      merriment the merriment must be that of a demon of this\r\n      singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring\r\n      men of nantucket these anecdotes went to prove his prodigious\r\n      strength when under excitement and some of them had given rise\r\n      to a doubt of his sanity but on board the grampus it seems he\r\n      was regarded at the time of the mutiny with feelings more of\r\n      derision than of anything else i have been thus particular in\r\n      speaking of dirk peters because ferocious as he appeared he\r\n      proved the main instrument in preserving the life of augustus\r\n      and because i shall have frequent occasion to mention him\r\n      hereafter in the course of my narrativea narrative let me here\r\n      say which in its latter portions will be found to include\r\n      incidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human\r\n      experience and for this reason so far beyond the limits of human\r\n      credulity that i proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining\r\n      credence for all that i shall tell yet confidently trusting in\r\n      time and progressing science to verify some of the most important\r\n      and most improbable of my statements\r\n\r\n      after much indecision and two or three violent quarrels it was\r\n      determined at last that all the prisoners with the exception of\r\n      augustus whom peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping\r\n      as his clerk should be set adrift in one of the smallest\r\n      whaleboats the mate went down into the cabin to see if captain\r\n      barnard was still livingfor it will be remembered he was left\r\n      below when the mutineers came up presently the two made their\r\n      appearance the captain pale as death but somewhat recovered\r\n      from the effects of his wound he spoke to the men in a voice\r\n      hardly articulate entreated them not to set him adrift but to\r\n      return to their duty and promising to land them wherever they\r\n      chose and to take no steps for bringing them to justice he\r\n      might as well have spoken to the winds two of the ruffians\r\n      seized him by the arms and hurled him over the brigs side into\r\n      the boat which had been lowered while the mate went below the\r\n      four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and ordered\r\n      to follow which they did without attempting any\r\n      resistanceaugustus being still left in his painful position\r\n      although he struggled and prayed only for the poor satisfaction\r\n      of being permitted to bid his father farewell a handful of\r\n      seabiscuit and a jug of water were now handed down but neither\r\n      mast sail oar nor compass the boat was towed astern for a few\r\n      minutes during which the mutineers held another consultationit\r\n      was then finally cut adrift by this time night had come onthere\r\n      were neither moon nor stars visibleand a short and ugly sea was\r\n      running although there was no great deal of wind the boat was\r\n      instantly out of sight and little hope could be entertained for\r\n      the unfortunate sufferers who were in it this event happened\r\n      however in latitude  degrees  north longitude  degrees\r\n       west and consequently at no very great distance from the\r\n      bermuda islands augustus therefore endeavored to console himself\r\n      with the idea that the boat might either succeed in reaching the\r\n      land or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by vessels\r\n      off the coast\r\n\r\n      all sail was now put upon the brig and she continued her\r\n      original course to the southwestthe mutineers being bent upon\r\n      some piratical expedition in which from all that could be\r\n      understood a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the cape\r\n      verd islands to porto rico no attention was paid to augustus\r\n      who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the\r\n      cabin companionway dirk peters treated him with some degree of\r\n      kindness and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the\r\n      cook his situation was still one of the most precarious as the\r\n      men were continually intoxicated and there was no relying upon\r\n      their continued goodhumor or carelessness in regard to himself\r\n      his anxiety on my account he represented however as the most\r\n      distressing result of his condition and indeed i had never\r\n      reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship more than once\r\n      he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my\r\n      being on board but was restrained from so doing partly through\r\n      recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld and partly\r\n      through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief for the\r\n      latter purpose he was constantly on the watch but in spite of\r\n      the most constant vigilance three days elapsed after the boat\r\n      was cut adrift before any chance occurred at length on the\r\n      night of the third day there came on a heavy blow from the\r\n      eastward and all hands were called up to take in sail during\r\n      the confusion which ensued he made his way below unobserved and\r\n      into the stateroom what was his grief and horror in discovering\r\n      that the latter had been rendered a place of deposit for a\r\n      variety of seastores and shipfurniture and that several\r\n      fathoms of old chaincable which had been stowed away beneath\r\n      the companionladder had been dragged thence to make room for a\r\n      chest and were now lying immediately upon the trap to remove it\r\n      without discovery was impossible and he returned on deck as\r\n      quickly as he could as he came up the mate seized him by the\r\n      throat and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin was\r\n      about flinging him over the larboard bulwark when his life was\r\n      again preserved through the interference of dirk peters augustus\r\n      was now put in handcuffs of which there were several pairs on\r\n      board and his feet lashed tightly together he was then taken\r\n      into the steerage and thrown into a lower berth next to the\r\n      forecastle bulkheads with the assurance that he should never put\r\n      his foot on deck again until the brig was no longer a brig\r\n      this was the expression of the cook who threw him into the\r\n      berthit is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended\r\n      by the phrase the whole affair however proved the ultimate\r\n      means of my relief as will presently appear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      for some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle augustus\r\n      abandoned himself to despair never hoping to leave the berth\r\n      alive he now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of\r\n      the men who should come down with my situation thinking it\r\n      better to let me take my chance with the mutineers than perish of\r\n      thirst in the holdfor it had been ten days since i was first\r\n      imprisoned and my jug of water was not a plentiful supply even\r\n      for four as he was thinking on this subject the idea came all\r\n      at once into his head that it might be possible to communicate\r\n      with me by the way of the main hold in any other circumstances\r\n      the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have prevented\r\n      him from attempting it but now he had at all events little\r\n      prospect of life and consequently little to lose he bent his\r\n      whole mind therefore upon the task\r\n\r\n      his handcuffs were the first consideration at first he saw no\r\n      method of removing them and feared that he should thus be\r\n      baffled in the very outset but upon a closer scrutiny he\r\n      discovered that the irons could be slipped off and on at\r\n      pleasure with very little effort or inconvenience merely by\r\n      squeezing his hands through themthis species of manacle being\r\n      altogether ineffectual in confining young persons in whom the\r\n      smaller bones readily yield to pressure he now untied his feet\r\n      and leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be\r\n      readjusted in the event of any persons coming down proceeded to\r\n      examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth the partition\r\n      here was of soft pine board an inch thick and he saw that he\r\n      should have little trouble in cutting his way through a voice\r\n      was now heard at the forecastle companionway and he had just\r\n      time to put his right hand into its handcuff the left had not\r\n      been removed and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his\r\n      ankle when dirk peters came below followed by tiger who\r\n      immediately leaped into the berth and lay down the dog had been\r\n      brought on board by augustus who knew my attachment to the\r\n      animal and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me\r\n      during the voyage he went up to our house for him immediately\r\n      after first taking me into the hold but did not think of\r\n      mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch since\r\n      the mutiny augustus had not seen him before his appearance with\r\n      dirk peters and had given him up for lost supposing him to have\r\n      been thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging\r\n      to the mates gang it appeared afterward that he had crawled\r\n      into a hole beneath a whaleboat from which not having room to\r\n      turn round he could not extricate himself peters at last let\r\n      him out and with a species of good feeling which my friend knew\r\n      well how to appreciate had now brought him to him in the\r\n      forecastle as a companion leaving at the same time some salt\r\n      junk and potatoes with a can of water he then went on deck\r\n      promising to come down with something more to eat on the next\r\n      day\r\n\r\n      when he had gone augustus freed both hands from the manacles and\r\n      unfastened his feet he then turned down the head of the mattress\r\n      on which he had been lying and with his penknife for the\r\n      ruffians had not thought it worth while to search him commenced\r\n      cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks as closely\r\n      as possible to the floor of the berth he chose to cut here\r\n      because if suddenly interrupted he would be able to conceal\r\n      what had been done by letting the head of the mattress fall into\r\n      its proper position for the remainder of the day however no\r\n      disturbance occurred and by night he had completely divided the\r\n      plank it should here be observed that none of the crew occupied\r\n      the forecastle as a sleepingplace living altogether in the\r\n      cabin since the mutiny drinking the wines and feasting on the\r\n      seastores of captain barnard and giving no more heed than was\r\n      absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig these\r\n      circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and augustus for\r\n      had matters been otherwise he would have found it impossible to\r\n      reach me as it was he proceeded with confidence in his design\r\n      it was near daybreak however before he completed the second\r\n      division of the board which was about a foot above the first\r\n      cut thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his\r\n      passage through with facility to the main orlop deck having got\r\n      here he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main\r\n      hatch although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of\r\n      oilcasks piled nearly as high as the upper deck there being\r\n      barely room enough left for his body upon reaching the hatch he\r\n      found that tiger had followed him below squeezing between two\r\n      rows of the casks it was now too late however to attempt\r\n      getting to me before dawn as the chief difficulty lay in passing\r\n      through the close stowage in the lower hold he therefore\r\n      resolved to return and wait till the next night with this\r\n      design he proceeded to loosen the hatch so that he might have\r\n      as little detention as possible when he should come again no\r\n      sooner had he loosened it than tiger sprang eagerly to the small\r\n      opening produced snuffed for a moment and then uttered a long\r\n      whine scratching at the same time as if anxious to remove the\r\n      covering with his paws there could be no doubt from his\r\n      behaviour that he was aware of my being in the hold and\r\n      augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me\r\n      if he put him down he now hit upon the expedient of sending the\r\n      note as it was especially desirable that i should make no\r\n      attempt at forcing my way out at least under existing\r\n      circumstances and there could be no certainty of his getting to\r\n      me himself on the morrow as he intended afterevents proved how\r\n      fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did for\r\n      had it not been for the receipt of the note i should undoubtedly\r\n      have fallen upon some plan however desperate of alarming the\r\n      crew and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed\r\n      in consequence\r\n\r\n      having concluded to write the difficulty was now to procure the\r\n      materials for so doing an old toothpick was soon made into a\r\n      pen and this by means of feeling altogether for the\r\n      betweendecks was as dark as pitch paper enough was obtained\r\n      from the back of a lettera duplicate of the forged letter from\r\n      mr ross this had been the original draught but the handwriting\r\n      not being sufficiently well imitated augustus had written\r\n      another thrusting the first by good fortune into his\r\n      coatpocket where it was now most opportunely discovered ink\r\n      alone was thus wanting and a substitute was immediately found\r\n      for this by means of a slight incision with the penknife on the\r\n      back of a finger just above the naila copious flow of blood\r\n      ensuing as usual from wounds in that vicinity the note was now\r\n      written as well as it could be in the dark and under the\r\n      circumstances it briefly explained that a mutiny had taken\r\n      place that captain barnard was set adrift and that i might\r\n      expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned but\r\n      must not venture upon making any disturbance it concluded with\r\n      these words i have scrawled this with bloodyour life depends\r\n      upon lying close\r\n\r\n      this slip of paper being tied upon the dog he was now put down\r\n      the hatchway and augustus made the best of his way back to the\r\n      forecastle where he found no reason to believe that any of the\r\n      crew had been in his absence to conceal the hole in the\r\n      partition he drove his knife in just above it and hung up a\r\n      peajacket which he found in the berth his handcuffs were then\r\n      replaced and also the rope around his ankles\r\n\r\n      these arrangements were scarcely completed when dirk peters came\r\n      below very drunk but in excellent humour and bringing with him\r\n      my friends allowance of provision for the day this consisted of\r\n      a dozen large irish potatoes roasted and a pitcher of water he\r\n      sat for some time on a chest by the berth and talked freely\r\n      about the mate and the general concerns of the brig his\r\n      demeanour was exceedingly capricious and even grotesque at one\r\n      time augustus was much alarmed by odd conduct at last however\r\n      he went on deck muttering a promise to bring his prisoner a good\r\n      dinner on the morrow during the day two of the crew harpooners\r\n      came down accompanied by the cook all three in nearly the last\r\n      stage of intoxication like peters they made no scruple of\r\n      talking unreservedly about their plans it appeared that they\r\n      were much divided among themselves as to their ultimate course\r\n      agreeing in no point except the attack on the ship from the cape\r\n      verd islands with which they were in hourly expectation of\r\n      meeting as far as could be ascertained the mutiny had not been\r\n      brought about altogether for the sake of booty a private pique\r\n      of the chief mates against captain barnard having been the main\r\n      instigation there now seemed to be two principal factions among\r\n      the crewone headed by the mate the other by the cook the\r\n      former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel which\r\n      should present itself and equipping it at some of the west india\r\n      islands for a piratical cruise the latter division however\r\n      which was the stronger and included dirk peters among its\r\n      partisans were bent upon pursuing the course originally laid out\r\n      for the brig into the south pacific there either to take whale\r\n      or act otherwise as circumstances should suggest the\r\n      representations of peters who had frequently visited these\r\n      regions had great weight apparently with the mutineers\r\n      wavering as they were between halfengendered notions of profit\r\n      and pleasure he dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to\r\n      be found among the innumerable islands of the pacific on the\r\n      perfect security and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed\r\n      but more particularly on the deliciousness of the climate on\r\n      the abundant means of good living and on the voluptuous beauty\r\n      of the women as yet nothing had been absolutely determined\r\n      upon but the pictures of the hybrid linemanager were taking\r\n      strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen and there\r\n      was every possibility that his intentions would be finally\r\n      carried into effect\r\n\r\n      the three men went away in about an hour and no one else entered\r\n      the forecastle all day augustus lay quiet until nearly night he\r\n      then freed himself from the rope and irons and prepared for his\r\n      attempt a bottle was found in one of the berths and this he\r\n      filled with water from the pitcher left by peters storing his\r\n      pockets at the same time with cold potatoes to his great joy he\r\n      also came across a lantern with a small piece of tallow candle\r\n      in it this he could light at any moment as he had in his\r\n      possession a box of phosphorus matches when it was quite dark\r\n      he got through the hole in the bulkhead having taken the\r\n      precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey\r\n      the idea of a person covered up when through he hung up the\r\n      peajacket on his knife as before to conceal the aperturethis\r\n      manoeuvre being easily effected as he did not readjust the piece\r\n      of plank taken out until afterward he was now on the main orlop\r\n      deck and proceeded to make his way as before between the upper\r\n      deck and the oilcasks to the main hatchway having reached this\r\n      he lit the piece of candle and descended groping with extreme\r\n      difficulty among the compact stowage of the hold in a few\r\n      moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench and the\r\n      closeness of the atmosphere he could not think it possible that\r\n      i had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so\r\n      oppressive an air he called my name repeatedly but i made him\r\n      no reply and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed the\r\n      brig was rolling violently and there was so much noise in\r\n      consequence that it was useless to listen for any weak sound\r\n      such as those of my breathing or snoring he threw open the\r\n      lantern and held it as high as possible whenever an opportunity\r\n      occurred in order that by observing the light i might if\r\n      alive be aware that succor was approaching still nothing was\r\n      heard from me and the supposition of my death began to assume\r\n      the character of certainty he determined nevertheless to force\r\n      a passage if possible to the box and at least ascertain beyond\r\n      a doubt the truth of his surmises he pushed on for some time in\r\n      a most pitiable state of anxiety until at length he found the\r\n      pathway utterly blocked up and that there was no possibility of\r\n      making any farther way by the course in which he had set out\r\n      overcome now by his feelings he threw himself among the lumber\r\n      in despair and wept like a child it was at this period that he\r\n      heard the crash occasioned by the bottle which i had thrown down\r\n      fortunate indeed was it that the incident occurredfor upon\r\n      this incident trivial as it appears the thread of my destiny\r\n      depended many years elapsed however before i was aware of this\r\n      fact a natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision\r\n      prevented augustus from confiding to me at once what a more\r\n      intimate and unreserved communion afterward induced him to\r\n      reveal upon finding his further progress in the hold impeded by\r\n      obstacles which he could not overcome he had resolved to abandon\r\n      his attempt at reaching me and return at once to the forecastle\r\n      before condemning him entirely on this head the harassing\r\n      circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken into\r\n      consideration the night was fast wearing away and his absence\r\n      from the forecastle might be discovered and indeed would\r\n      necessarily be so if he should fail to get back to the berth by\r\n      daybreak his candle was expiring in the socket and there would\r\n      be the greatest difficulty in retracing his way to the hatchway\r\n      in the dark it must be allowed too that he had every good\r\n      reason to believe me dead in which event no benefit could result\r\n      to me from his reaching the box and a world of danger would be\r\n      encountered to no purpose by himself he had repeatedly called\r\n      and i had made him no answer i had been now eleven days and\r\n      nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he\r\n      had left with mea supply which it was not at all probable i had\r\n      hoarded in the beginning of my confinement as i had every cause\r\n      to expect a speedy release the atmosphere of the hold too must\r\n      have appeared to him coming from the comparatively open air of\r\n      the steerage of a nature absolutely poisonous and by far more\r\n      intolerable than it had seemed to me upon my first taking up my\r\n      quarters in the boxthe hatchways at that time having been\r\n      constantly open for many months previous add to these\r\n      considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so\r\n      lately witnessed by my friend his confinement privations and\r\n      narrow escapes from death together with the frail and equivocal\r\n      tenure by which he still existedcircumstances all so well\r\n      calculated to prostrate every energy of mindand the reader will\r\n      be easily brought as i have been to regard his apparent falling\r\n      off in friendship and in faith with sentiments rather of sorrow\r\n      than of anger\r\n\r\n      the crash of the bottle was distinctly heard yet augustus was\r\n      not sure that it proceeded from the hold the doubt however was\r\n      sufficient inducement to persevere he clambered up nearly to the\r\n      orlop deck by means of the stowage and then watching for a lull\r\n      in the pitchings of the vessel he called out to me in as loud a\r\n      tone as he could command regardless for the moment of being\r\n      overheard by the crew it will be remembered that on this\r\n      occasion the voice reached me but i was so entirely overcome by\r\n      violent agitation as to be incapable of reply confident now\r\n      that his worst apprehensions were well founded he descended\r\n      with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss of\r\n      time in his haste some small boxes were thrown down the noise\r\n      occasioned by which i heard as will be recollected he had made\r\n      considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife\r\n      again caused him to hesitate he retraced his steps immediately\r\n      and clambering up the stowage a second time called out my name\r\n      loudly as before having watched for a lull this time i found\r\n      voice to answer overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive\r\n      he now resolved to brave every difficulty and danger in reaching\r\n      me having extricated himself as quickly as possible from the\r\n      labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed in he at length\r\n      struck into an opening which promised better and finally after\r\n      a series of struggles arrived at the box in a state of utter\r\n      exhaustion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      the leading particulars of this narration were all that augustus\r\n      communicated to me while we remained near the box it was not\r\n      until afterward that he entered fully into all the details he\r\n      was apprehensive of being missed and i was wild with impatience\r\n      to leave my detested place of confinement we resolved to make\r\n      our way at once to the hole in the bulkhead near which i was to\r\n      remain for the present while he went through to reconnoiter to\r\n      leave tiger in the box was what neither of us could endure to\r\n      think of yet how to act otherwise was the question he now\r\n      seemed to be perfectly quiet and we could not even distinguish\r\n      the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely to the\r\n      box i was convinced that he was dead and determined to open the\r\n      door we found him lying at full length apparently in a deep\r\n      stupor yet still alive no time was to be lost yet i could not\r\n      bring myself to abandon an animal who had now been twice\r\n      instrumental in saving my life without some attempt at\r\n      preserving him we therefore dragged him along with us as well as\r\n      we could although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue\r\n      augustus during part of the time being forced to clamber over\r\n      the impediments in our way with the huge dog in his armsa feat\r\n      to which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally\r\n      inadequate at length we succeeded in reaching the hole when\r\n      augustus got through and tiger was pushed in afterward all was\r\n      found to be safe and we did not fail to return sincere thanks to\r\n      god for our deliverance from the imminent danger we had escaped\r\n      for the present it was agreed that i should remain near the\r\n      opening through which my companion could readily supply me with\r\n      a part of his daily provision and where i could have the\r\n      advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure\r\n\r\n      in explanation of some portions of this narrative wherein i have\r\n      spoken of the stowage of the brig and which may appear ambiguous\r\n      to some of my readers who may have seen a proper or regular\r\n      stowage i must here state that the manner in which this most\r\n      important duty had been performed on board the grampus was a most\r\n      shameful piece of neglect on the part of captain barnard who was\r\n      by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman as the\r\n      hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would\r\n      seem necessarily to demand a proper stowage cannot be\r\n      accomplished in a careless manner and many most disastrous\r\n      accidents even within the limits of my own experience have\r\n      arisen from neglect or ignorance in this particular coasting\r\n      vessels in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking\r\n      in or discharging cargo are the most liable to mishap from the\r\n      want of a proper attention to stowage the great point is to\r\n      allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting position\r\n      even in the most violent rollings of the vessel with this end\r\n      great attention must be paid not only to the bulk taken in but\r\n      to the nature of the bulk and whether there be a full or only a\r\n      partial cargo in most kinds of freight the stowage is\r\n      accomplished by means of a screw thus in a load of tobacco or\r\n      flour the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the\r\n      vessel that the barrels or hogsheads upon discharging are found\r\n      to be completely flattened and take some time to regain their\r\n      original shape this screwing however is resorted to\r\n      principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold for\r\n      in a full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco there\r\n      can be no danger of any shifting whatever at least none from\r\n      which inconvenience can result there have been instances\r\n      indeed where this method of screwing has resulted in the most\r\n      lamentable consequences arising from a cause altogether distinct\r\n      from the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo a load of\r\n      cotton for example tightly screwed while in certain conditions\r\n      has been known through the expansion of its bulk to rend a\r\n      vessel asunder at sea there can be no doubt either that the same\r\n      result would ensue in the case of tobacco while undergoing its\r\n      usual course of fermentation were it not for the interstices\r\n      consequent upon the rotundity of the hogsheads\r\n\r\n      it is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to\r\n      be apprehended from shifting and that precautions should be\r\n      always taken to guard against such misfortune only those who\r\n      have encountered a violent gale of wind or rather who have\r\n      experienced the rolling of a vessel in a sudden calm after the\r\n      gale can form an idea of the tremendous force of the plunges\r\n      and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose\r\n      articles in the vessel it is then that the necessity of a\r\n      cautious stowage when there is a partial cargo becomes obvious\r\n      when lyingto especially with a small head sail a vessel which\r\n      is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon\r\n      her beamends this occurring even every fifteen or twenty\r\n      minutes upon an average yet without any serious consequences\r\n      resulting provided there be a proper stowage if this however\r\n      has not been strictly attended to in the first of these heavy\r\n      lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the side of the\r\n      vessel which lies upon the water and being thus prevented from\r\n      regaining her equilibrium as she would otherwise necessarily do\r\n      she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down it is not\r\n      too much to say that at least onehalf of the instances in which\r\n      vessels have foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to\r\n      a shifting of cargo or of ballast\r\n\r\n      when a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board the whole\r\n      after being first stowed as compactly as may be should be\r\n      covered with a layer of stout shiftingboards extending\r\n      completely across the vessel upon these boards strong temporary\r\n      stanchions should be erected reaching to the timbers above and\r\n      thus securing every thing in its place in cargoes consisting of\r\n      grain or any similar matter additional precautions are\r\n      requisite a hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port\r\n      will be found not more than three fourths full upon reaching its\r\n      destinationthis too although the freight when measured bushel\r\n      by bushel by the consignee will overrun by a vast deal on\r\n      account of the swelling of the grain the quantity consigned\r\n      this result is occasioned by settling during the voyage and is\r\n      the more perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the\r\n      weather experienced if grain loosely thrown in a vessel then\r\n      is ever so well secured by shiftingboards and stanchions it\r\n      will be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring\r\n      about the most distressing calamities to prevent these every\r\n      method should be employed before leaving port to settle the cargo\r\n      as much as possible and for this there are many contrivances\r\n      among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into the\r\n      grain even after all this is done and unusual pains taken to\r\n      secure the shiftingboards no seaman who knows what he is about\r\n      will feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a\r\n      cargo of grain on board and least of all with a partial cargo\r\n      yet there are hundreds of our coasting vessels and it is\r\n      likely many more from the ports of europe which sail daily with\r\n      partial cargoes even of the most dangerous species and without\r\n      any precaution whatever the wonder is that no more accidents\r\n      occur than do actually happen a lamentable instance of this\r\n      heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of captain joel\r\n      rice of the schooner firefly which sailed from richmond\r\n      virginia to madeira with a cargo of corn in the year  the\r\n      captain had gone many voyages without serious accident although\r\n      he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his\r\n      stowage more than to secure it in the ordinary manner he had\r\n      never before sailed with a cargo of grain and on this occasion\r\n      had the corn thrown on board loosely when it did not much more\r\n      than half fill the vessel for the first portion of the voyage he\r\n      met with nothing more than light breezes but when within a days\r\n      sail of madeira there came on a strong gale from the n n e\r\n      which forced him to lieto he brought the schooner to the wind\r\n      under a doublereefed foresail alone when she rode as well as\r\n      any vessel could be expected to do and shipped not a drop of\r\n      water toward night the gale somewhat abated and she rolled with\r\n      more unsteadiness than before but still did very well until a\r\n      heavy lurch threw her upon her beamends to starboard the corn\r\n      was then heard to shift bodily the force of the movement\r\n      bursting open the main hatchway the vessel went down like a\r\n      shot this happened within hail of a small sloop from madeira\r\n      which picked up one of the crew the only person saved and\r\n      which rode out the gale in perfect security as indeed a jolly\r\n      boat might have done under proper management\r\n\r\n      the stowage on board the grampus was most clumsily done if\r\n      stowage that could be called which was little better than a\r\n      promiscuous huddling together of oilcasks  and ship\r\n      furniture i have already spoken of the condition of articles in\r\n      the hold on the orlop deck there was space enough for my body\r\n      as i have stated between the oilcasks and the upper deck a\r\n      space was left open around the main hatchway and several other\r\n      large spaces were left in the stowage near the hole cut through\r\n      the bulkhead by augustus there was room enough for an entire\r\n      cask and in this space i found myself comfortably situated for\r\n      the present\r\n\r\n      by the time my friend had got safely into the berth and\r\n      readjusted his handcuffs and the rope it was broad daylight we\r\n      had made a narrow escape indeed for scarcely had he arranged all\r\n      matters when the mate came below with dirk peters and the cook\r\n      they talked for some time about the vessel from the cape verds\r\n      and seemed to be excessively anxious for her appearance at\r\n      length the cook came to the berth in which augustus was lying\r\n      and seated himself in it near the head i could see and hear\r\n      every thing from my hidingplace for the piece cut out had not\r\n      been put back and i was in momentary expectation that the negro\r\n      would fall against the peajacket which was hung up to conceal\r\n      the aperture in which case all would have been discovered and\r\n      our lives would no doubt have been instantly sacrificed our\r\n      good fortune prevailed however and although he frequently\r\n      touched it as the vessel rolled he never pressed against it\r\n      sufficiently to bring about a discovery the bottom of the jacket\r\n      had been carefully fastened to the bulkhead so that the hole\r\n      might not be seen by its swinging to one side all this time\r\n      tiger was lying in the foot of the berth and appeared to have\r\n      recovered in some measure his faculties for i could see him\r\n      occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath\r\n\r\n      after a few minutes the mate and cook went above leaving dirk\r\n      peters behind who as soon as they were gone came and sat\r\n      himself down in the place just occupied by the mate he began to\r\n      talk very sociably with augustus and we could now see that the\r\n      greater part of his apparent intoxication while the two others\r\n      were with him was a feint he answered all my companions\r\n      questions with perfect freedom told him that he had no doubt of\r\n      his fathers having been picked up as there were no less than\r\n      five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he was cut\r\n      adrift and used other language of a consolatory nature which\r\n      occasioned me no less surprise than pleasure indeed i began to\r\n      entertain hopes that through the instrumentality of peters we\r\n      might be finally enabled to regain possession of the brig and\r\n      this idea i mentioned to augustus as soon as i found an\r\n      opportunity he thought the matter possible but urged the\r\n      necessity of the greatest caution in making the attempt as the\r\n      conduct of the hybrid appeared to be instigated by the most\r\n      arbitrary caprice alone and indeed it was difficult to say if\r\n      he was at any moment of sound mind peters went upon deck in\r\n      about an hour and did not return again until noon when he\r\n      brought augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding of\r\n      this when we were left alone i partook heartily without\r\n      returning through the hole no one else came down into the\r\n      forecastle during the day and at night i got into augustus\r\n      berth where i slept soundly and sweetly until nearly daybreak\r\n      when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon deck and i regained\r\n      my hidingplace as quickly as possible when the day was fully\r\n      broke we found that tiger had recovered his strength almost\r\n      entirely and gave no indications of hydrophobia drinking a\r\n      little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness\r\n      during the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite\r\n      his strange conduct had been brought on no doubt by the\r\n      deleterious quality of the air of the hold and had no connexion\r\n      with canine madness i could not sufficiently rejoice that i had\r\n      persisted in bringing him with me from the box this day was the\r\n      thirtieth of june and the thirteenth since the grampus made sail\r\n      from nantucket\r\n\r\n      on the second of july the mate came below drunk as usual and in\r\n      an excessively goodhumor he came to augustuss berth and\r\n      giving him a slap on the back asked him if he thought he could\r\n      behave himself if he let him loose and whether he would promise\r\n      not to be going into the cabin again to this of course my\r\n      friend answered in the affirmative when the ruffian set him at\r\n      liberty after making him drink from a flask of rum which he drew\r\n      from his coatpocket both now went on deck and i did not see\r\n      augustus for about three hours he then came below with the good\r\n      news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he\r\n      pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast and that he had been\r\n      ordered to sleep as usual in the forecastle he brought me\r\n      too a good dinner and a plentiful supply of water the brig was\r\n      still cruising for the vessel from the cape verds and a sail was\r\n      now in sight which was thought to be the one in question as the\r\n      events of the ensuing eight days were of little importance and\r\n      had no direct bearing upon the main incidents of my narrative i\r\n      will here throw them into the form of a journal as i do not wish\r\n      to omit them altogether\r\n\r\n      july  augustus furnished me with three blankets with which i\r\n      contrived a comfortable bed in my hidingplace no one came\r\n      below except my companion during the day tiger took his\r\n      station in the berth just by the aperture and slept heavily as\r\n      if not yet entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness\r\n      toward night a flaw of wind struck the brig before sail could be\r\n      taken in and very nearly capsized her the puff died away\r\n      immediately however and no damage was done beyond the splitting\r\n      of the foretopsail dirk peters treated augustus all this day\r\n      with great kindness and entered into a long conversation with him\r\n      respecting the pacific ocean and the islands he had visited in\r\n      that region he asked him whether he would not like to go with\r\n      the mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those\r\n      quarters and said that the men were gradually coming over to the\r\n      mates views to this augustus thought it best to reply that he\r\n      would be glad to go on such an adventure since nothing better\r\n      could be done and that any thing was preferable to a piratical\r\n      life\r\n\r\n      july th the vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from\r\n      liverpool and was allowed to pass unmolested augustus spent\r\n      most of his time on deck with a view of obtaining all the\r\n      information in his power respecting the intentions of the\r\n      mutineers they had frequent and violent quarrels among\r\n      themselves in one of which a harpooner jim bonner was thrown\r\n      overboard the party of the mate was gaining ground jim bonner\r\n      belonged to the cooks gang of which peters was a partisan\r\n\r\n      july th about daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the\r\n      west which at noon freshened into a gale so that the brig could\r\n      carry nothing more than her trysail and foresail in taking in\r\n      the foretopsail simms one of the common hands and belonging\r\n      also to the cooks gang fell overboard being very much in\r\n      liquor and was drownedno attempt being made to save him the\r\n      whole number of persons on board was now thirteen to wit dirk\r\n      peters seymour the black cook jones greely hartman rogers\r\n      and william allen all of the cooks party the mate whose name\r\n      i never learned absalom hicks wilson john hunty richard\r\n      parker of the mates partybesides augustus and myself\r\n\r\n      july th the gale lasted all this day blowing in heavy squalls\r\n      accompanied with rain the brig took in a good deal of water\r\n      through her seams and one of the pumps was kept continually\r\n      going augustus being forced to take his turn just at twilight a\r\n      large ship passed close by us without having been discovered\r\n      until within hail the ship was supposed to be the one for which\r\n      the mutineers were on the lookout the mate hailed her but the\r\n      reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale at eleven a sea\r\n      was shipped amidships which tore away a great portion of the\r\n      larboard bulwarks and did some other slight damage toward\r\n      morning the weather moderated and at sunrise there was very\r\n      little wind\r\n\r\n      july th there was a heavy swell running all this day during\r\n      which the brig being light rolled excessively and many\r\n      articles broke loose in the hold as i could hear distinctly from\r\n      my hidingplace i suffered a great deal from seasickness\r\n      peters had a long conversation this day with augustus and told\r\n      him that two of his gang greely and allen had gone over to the\r\n      mate and were resolved to turn pirates he put several questions\r\n      to augustus which he did not then exactly understand during a\r\n      part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel and little\r\n      could be done to remedy it as it was occasioned by the brigs\r\n      straining and taking in the water through her seams a sail was\r\n      thrummed and got under the bows which aided us in some measure\r\n      so that we began to gain upon the leak\r\n\r\n      july th a light breeze sprang up at sunrise from the eastward\r\n      when the mate headed the brig to the southwest with the\r\n      intention of making some of the west india islands in pursuance\r\n      of his piratical designs no opposition was made by peters or the\r\n      cookat least none in the hearing of augustus all idea of taking\r\n      the vessel from the cape verds was abandoned the leak was now\r\n      easily kept under by one pump going every three quarters of an\r\n      hour the sail was drawn from beneath the bows spoke two small\r\n      schooners during the day\r\n\r\n      july th fine weather all hands employed in repairing bulwarks\r\n      peters had again a long conversation with augustus and spoke\r\n      more plainly than he had done heretofore he said nothing should\r\n      induce him to come into the mates views and even hinted his\r\n      intention of taking the brig out of his hands he asked my friend\r\n      if he could depend upon his aid in such case to which augustus\r\n      said yes without hesitation peters then said he would sound\r\n      the others of his party upon the subject and went away during\r\n      the remainder of the day augustus had no opportunity of speaking\r\n      with him privately\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      july  spoke a brig from rio bound to norfolk weather hazy\r\n      with a light baffling wind from the eastward today hartman\r\n      rogers died having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after\r\n      drinking a glass of grog this man was of the cooks party and\r\n      one upon whom peters placed his main reliance he told augustus\r\n      that he believed the mate had poisoned him and that he expected\r\n      if he did not be on the lookout his own turn would come\r\n      shortly there were now only himself jones and the cook\r\n      belonging to his own gangon the other side there were five he\r\n      had spoken to jones about taking the command from the mate but\r\n      the project having been coolly received he had been deterred\r\n      from pressing the matter any further or from saying any thing to\r\n      the cook it was well as it happened that he was so prudent\r\n      for in the afternoon the cook expressed his determination of\r\n      siding with the mate and went over formally to that party while\r\n      jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with peters and hinted\r\n      that he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation there\r\n      was now evidently no time to be lost and peters expressed his\r\n      determination of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards\r\n      provided augustus would lend him his aid my friend at once\r\n      assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that\r\n      purpose and thinking the opportunity a favourable one made\r\n      known the fact of my being on board at this the hybrid was not\r\n      more astonished than delighted as he had no reliance whatever\r\n      upon jones whom he already considered as belonging to the party\r\n      of the mate they went below immediately when augustus called to\r\n      me by name and peters and myself were soon made acquainted it\r\n      was agreed that we should attempt to retake the vessel upon the\r\n      first good opportunity leaving jones altogether out of our\r\n      councils in the event of success we were to run the brig into\r\n      the first port that offered and deliver her up the desertion of\r\n      his party had frustrated peters design of going into the\r\n      pacifican adventure which could not be accomplished without a\r\n      crew and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial\r\n      on the score of insanity which he solemnly avowed had actuated\r\n      him in lending his aid to the mutiny or upon obtaining a\r\n      pardon if found guilty through the representations of augustus\r\n      and myself our deliberations were interrupted for the present by\r\n      the cry of all hands take in sail and peters and augustus ran\r\n      up on deck\r\n\r\n      as usual the crew were nearly all drunk and before sail could\r\n      be properly taken in a violent squall laid the brig on her\r\n      beamends by keeping her away however she righted having\r\n      shipped a good deal of water scarcely was everything secure\r\n      when another squall took the vessel and immediately afterward\r\n      anotherno damage being done there was every appearance of a\r\n      gale of wind which indeed shortly came on with great fury\r\n      from the northward and westward all was made as snug as\r\n      possible and we laidto as usual under a closereefed\r\n      foresail as night drew on the wind increased in violence with\r\n      a remarkably heavy sea peters now came into the forecastle with\r\n      augustus and we resumed our deliberations\r\n\r\n      we agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the\r\n      present for carrying our designs into effect as an attempt at\r\n      such a moment would never be anticipated as the brig was snugly\r\n      laidto there would be no necessity of manoeuvring her until\r\n      good weather when if we succeeded in our attempt we might\r\n      liberate one or perhaps two of the men to aid us in taking her\r\n      into port the main difficulty was the great disproportion in our\r\n      forces there were only three of us and in the cabin there were\r\n      nine all the arms on board too were in their possession with\r\n      the exception of a pair of small pistols which peters had\r\n      concealed about his person and the large seamans knife which he\r\n      always wore in the waistband of his pantaloons from certain\r\n      indications toosuch for example as there being no such thing\r\n      as an axe or a handspike lying in their customary placeswe began\r\n      to fear that the mate had his suspicions at least in regard to\r\n      peters and that he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid\r\n      of him it was clear indeed that what we should determine to do\r\n      could not be done too soon still the odds were too much against\r\n      us to allow of our proceeding without the greatest caution\r\n\r\n      peters proposed that he should go up on deck and enter into\r\n      conversation with the watch allen when he would be able to\r\n      throw him into the sea without trouble and without making any\r\n      disturbance by seizing a good opportunity that augustus and\r\n      myself should then come up and endeavour to provide ourselves\r\n      with some kind of weapons from the deck and that we should then\r\n      make a rush together and secure the companionway before any\r\n      opposition could be offered i objected to this because i could\r\n      not believe that the mate who was a cunning fellow in all\r\n      matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudices would\r\n      suffer himself to be so easily entrapped the very fact of there\r\n      being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was\r\n      upon the alertit not being usual except in vessels where\r\n      discipline is most rigidly enforced to station a watch on deck\r\n      when a vessel is lyingto in a gale of wind as i address myself\r\n      principally if not altogether to persons who have never been to\r\n      sea it may be as well to state the exact condition of a vessel\r\n      under such circumstances lyingto or in seaparlance\r\n      layingto is a measure resorted to for various purposes and\r\n      effected in various manners in moderate weather it is frequently\r\n      done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a standstill\r\n      to wait for another vessel or any similar object if the vessel\r\n      which liesto is under full sail the manoeuvre is usually\r\n      accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails so as\r\n      to let the wind take them aback when she becomes stationary but\r\n      we are now speaking of lyingto in a gale of wind this is done\r\n      when the wind is ahead and too violent to admit of carrying sail\r\n      without danger of capsizing and sometimes even when the wind is\r\n      fair but the sea too heavy for the vessel to be put before it\r\n      if a vessel be suffered to scud before the wind in a very heavy\r\n      sea much damage is usually done her by the shipping of water\r\n      over her stern and sometimes by the violent plunges she makes\r\n      forward this manoeuvre then is seldom resorted to in such\r\n      case unless through necessity when the vessel is in a leaky\r\n      condition she is often put before the wind even in the heaviest\r\n      seas for when lyingto her seams are sure to be greatly opened\r\n      by her violent straining and it is not so much the case when\r\n      scudding often too it becomes necessary to scud a vessel\r\n      either when the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in\r\n      pieces the sail which is employed with a view of bringing her\r\n      head to the wind or when through the false modelling of the\r\n      frame or other causes this main object cannot be effected\r\n\r\n      vessels in a gale of wind are laidto in different manners\r\n      according to their peculiar construction some lieto best under\r\n      a foresail and this i believe is the sail most usually\r\n      employed large squarerigged vessels have sails for the express\r\n      purpose called stormstaysails but the jib is occasionally\r\n      employed by itselfsometimes the jib and foresail or a\r\n      doublereefed foresail and not unfrequently the aftersails are\r\n      made use of foretopsails are very often found to answer the\r\n      purpose better than any other species of sail the grampus was\r\n      generally laidto under a closereefed foresail\r\n\r\n      when a vessel is to be laidto her head is brought up to the\r\n      wind just so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when\r\n      hauled flat aft that is when brought diagonally across the\r\n      vessel this being done the bows point within a few degrees of\r\n      the direction from which the wind issues and the windward bow of\r\n      course receives the shock of the waves in this situation a good\r\n      vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind without shipping a\r\n      drop of water and without any further attention being requisite\r\n      on the part of the crew the helm is usually lashed down but\r\n      this is altogether unnecessary except on account of the noise it\r\n      makes when loose for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel\r\n      when lyingto indeed the helm had far better be left loose than\r\n      lashed very fast for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy\r\n      seas if there be no room for the helm to play as long as the\r\n      sail holds a well modelled vessel will maintain her situation\r\n      and ride every sea as if instinct with life and reason if the\r\n      violence of the wind however should tear the sail into pieces\r\n      a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under\r\n      ordinary circumstances there is then imminent danger the\r\n      vessel falls off from the wind and coming broadside to the sea\r\n      is completely at its mercy the only resource in this case is to\r\n      put her quietly before the wind letting her scud until some\r\n      other sail can be set some vessels will lieto under no sail\r\n      whatever but such are not to be trusted at sea\r\n\r\n      but to return from this digression it had never been customary\r\n      with the mate to have any watch on deck when lyingto in a gale\r\n      of wind and the fact that he had now one coupled with the\r\n      circumstance of the missing axes and handspikes fully convinced\r\n      us that the crew were too well on the watch to be taken by\r\n      surprise in the manner peters had suggested something however\r\n      was to be done and that with as little delay as practicable for\r\n      there could be no doubt that a suspicion having been once\r\n      entertained against peters he would be sacrificed upon the\r\n      earliest occasion and one would certainly be either found or\r\n      made upon the breaking of the gale\r\n\r\n      augustus now suggested that if peters could contrive to remove\r\n      under any pretext the piece of chaincable which lay over the\r\n      trap in the stateroom we might possibly be able to come upon\r\n      them unawares by means of the hold but a little reflection\r\n      convinced us that the vessel rolled and pitched too violently for\r\n      any attempt of that nature\r\n\r\n      by good fortune i at length hit upon the idea of working upon the\r\n      superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate it will\r\n      be remembered that one of the crew hartman rogers had died\r\n      during the morning having been attacked two days before with\r\n      spasms after drinking some spirits and water peters had\r\n      expressed to us his opinion that this man had been poisoned by\r\n      the mate and for this belief he had reasons so he said which\r\n      were incontrovertible but which he could not be prevailed upon\r\n      to explain to usthis wayward refusal being only in keeping with\r\n      other points of his singular character but whether or not he had\r\n      any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves\r\n      we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion and determined\r\n      to act accordingly\r\n\r\n      rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon in violent\r\n      convulsions and the corpse presented in a few minutes after\r\n      death one of the most horrid and loathsome spectacles i ever\r\n      remember to have seen the stomach was swollen immensely like\r\n      that of a man who has been drowned and lain under water for many\r\n      weeks the hands were in the same condition while the face was\r\n      shrunken shrivelled and of a chalky whiteness except where\r\n      relieved by two or three glaring red blotches like those\r\n      occasioned by the erysipelas one of these blotches extended\r\n      diagonally across the face completely covering up an eye as if\r\n      with a band of red velvet in this disgusting condition the body\r\n      had been brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown\r\n      overboard when the mate getting a glimpse of it for he now saw\r\n      it for the first time and being either touched with remorse for\r\n      his crime or struck with terror at so horrible a sight ordered\r\n      the men to sew the body up in its hammock and allow it the usual\r\n      rites of seaburial having given these directions he went\r\n      below as if to avoid any further sight of his victim while\r\n      preparations were making to obey his orders the gale came on\r\n      with great fury and the design was abandoned for the present\r\n      the corpse left to itself was washed into the larboard\r\n      scuppers where it still lay at the time of which i speak\r\n      floundering about with the furious lurches of the brig\r\n\r\n      having arranged our plan we set about putting it in execution as\r\n      speedily as possible peters went upon deck and as he had\r\n      anticipated was immediately accosted by allen who appeared to\r\n      be stationed more as a watch upon the forecastle than for any\r\n      other purpose the fate of this villain however was speedily\r\n      and silently decided for peters approaching him in a careless\r\n      manner as if about to address him seized him by the throat\r\n      and before he could utter a single cry tossed him over the\r\n      bulwarks he then called to us and we came up our first\r\n      precaution was to look about for something with which to arm\r\n      ourselves and in doing this we had to proceed with great care\r\n      for it was impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding\r\n      fast and violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge\r\n      forward it was indispensable too that we should be quick in\r\n      our operations for every minute we expected the mate to be up to\r\n      set the pumps going as it was evident the brig must be taking in\r\n      water very fast after searching about for some time we could\r\n      find nothing more fit for our purpose than the two pumphandles\r\n      one of which augustus took and i the other having secured\r\n      these we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and dropped the\r\n      body overboard peters and myself then went below leaving\r\n      augustus to watch upon deck where he took his station just where\r\n      allen had been placed and with his back to the cabin\r\n      companionway so that if any of the mates gang should come up\r\n      he might suppose it was the watch\r\n\r\n      as soon as i got below i commenced disguising myself so as to\r\n      represent the corpse of rogers the shirt which we had taken from\r\n      the body aided us very much for it was of singular form and\r\n      character and easily recognizablea kind of smock which the\r\n      deceased wore over his other clothing it was a blue stockinett\r\n      with large white stripes running across having put this on i\r\n      proceeded to equip myself with a false stomach in imitation of\r\n      the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse this was soon\r\n      effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes i then gave\r\n      the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white\r\n      woollen mittens and filling them in with any kind of rags that\r\n      offered themselves peters then arranged my face first rubbing\r\n      it well over with white chalk and afterward blotching it with\r\n      blood which he took from a cut in his finger the streak across\r\n      the eye was not forgotten and presented a most shocking\r\n      appearance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      as i viewed myself in a fragment of lookingglass which hung up\r\n      in the cabin and by the dim light of a kind of battlelantern i\r\n      was so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance and\r\n      at the recollection of the terrific reality which i was thus\r\n      representing that i was seized with a violent tremour and could\r\n      scarcely summon resolution to go on with my part it was\r\n      necessary however to act with decision and peters and myself\r\n      went upon deck\r\n\r\n      we there found everything safe and keeping close to the\r\n      bulwarks the three of us crept to the cabin companionway it\r\n      was only partially closed precautions having been taken to\r\n      prevent its being suddenly pushed to from without by means of\r\n      placing billets of wood on the upper step so as to interfere with\r\n      the shutting we found no difficulty in getting a full view of\r\n      the interior of the cabin through the cracks where the hinges\r\n      were placed it now proved to have been very fortunate for us\r\n      that we had not attempted to take them by surprise for they were\r\n      evidently on the alert only one was asleep and he lying just at\r\n      the foot of the companionladder with a musket by his side the\r\n      rest were seated on several mattresses which had been taken from\r\n      the berths and thrown on the floor they were engaged in earnest\r\n      conversation and although they had been carousing as appeared\r\n      from two empty jugs with some tin tumblers which lay about they\r\n      were not as much intoxicated as usual all had knives one or two\r\n      of them pistols and a great many muskets were lying in a berth\r\n      close at hand\r\n\r\n      we listened to their conversation for some time before we could\r\n      make up our minds how to act having as yet resolved on nothing\r\n      determinate except that we would attempt to paralyze their\r\n      exertions when we should attack them by means of the apparition\r\n      of rogers they were discussing their piratical plans in which\r\n      all we could hear distinctly was that they would unite with the\r\n      crew of a schooner hornet and if possible get the schooner\r\n      herself into their possession preparatory to some attempt on a\r\n      large scale the particulars of which could not be made out by\r\n      either of us\r\n\r\n      one of the men spoke of peters when the mate replied to him in a\r\n      low voice which could not be distinguished and afterward added\r\n      more loudly that he could not understand his being so much\r\n      forward with the captains brat in the forecastle and he thought\r\n      the sooner both of them were overboard the better to this no\r\n      answer was made but we could easily perceive that the hint was\r\n      well received by the whole party and more particularly by jones\r\n      at this period i was excessively agitated the more so as i could\r\n      see that neither augustus nor peters could determine how to act\r\n      i made up my mind however to sell my life as dearly as\r\n      possible and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any feelings\r\n      of trepidation\r\n\r\n      the tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the\r\n      rigging and the washing of the sea over the deck prevented us\r\n      from hearing what was said except during momentary lulls in one\r\n      of these we all distinctly heard the mate tell one of the men to\r\n      go forward have an eye upon them for he wanted no such secret\r\n      doings on board the brig it was well for us that the pitching\r\n      of the vessel at this moment was so violent as to prevent this\r\n      order from being carried into instant execution the cook got up\r\n      from his mattress to go for us when a tremendous lurch which i\r\n      thought would carry away the masts threw him headlong against\r\n      one of the larboard stateroom doors bursting it open and\r\n      creating a good deal of other confusion luckily neither of our\r\n      party was thrown from his position and we had time to make a\r\n      precipitate retreat to the forecastle and arrange a hurried plan\r\n      of action before the messenger made his appearance or rather\r\n      before he put his head out of the companionhatch for he did not\r\n      come on deck from this station he could not notice the absence\r\n      of allen and he accordingly bawled out as if to him repeating\r\n      the orders of the mate peters cried out ay ay in a\r\n      disguised voice and the cook immediately went below without\r\n      entertaining a suspicion that all was not right\r\n\r\n      my two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the\r\n      cabin peters closing the door after him in the same manner he\r\n      had found it the mate received them with feigned cordiality and\r\n      told augustus that since he had behaved himself so well of late\r\n      he might take up his quarters in the cabin and be one of them for\r\n      the future he then poured him out a tumbler half full of rum\r\n      and made him drink it all this i saw and heard for i followed\r\n      my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut and took up\r\n      my old point of observation i had brought with me the two\r\n      pumphandles one of which i secured near the companionway to\r\n      be ready for use when required\r\n\r\n      i now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good\r\n      view of all that was passing within and endeavoured to nerve\r\n      myself to the task of descending among the mutineers when peters\r\n      should make a signal to me as agreed upon presently he\r\n      contrived to turn the conversation upon the bloody deeds of the\r\n      mutiny and by degrees led the men to talk of the thousand\r\n      superstitions which are so universally current among seamen i\r\n      could not make out all that was said but i could plainly see the\r\n      effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present\r\n      the mate was evidently much agitated and presently when some\r\n      one mentioned the terrific appearance of rogers corpse i\r\n      thought he was upon the point of swooning peters now asked him\r\n      if he did not think it would be better to have the body thrown\r\n      overboard at once as it was too horrible a sight to see it\r\n      floundering about in the scuppers at this the villain absolutely\r\n      gasped for breath and turned his head slowly round upon his\r\n      companions as if imploring some one to go up and perform the\r\n      task no one however stirred and it was quite evident that the\r\n      whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous\r\n      excitement peters now made me the signal i immediately threw\r\n      open the door of the companionway and descending without\r\n      uttering a syllable stood erect in the midst of the party\r\n\r\n      the intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at\r\n      all to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken\r\n      into consideration usually in cases of a similar nature there\r\n      is left in the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as\r\n      to the reality of the vision before his eyes a degree of hope\r\n      however feeble that he is the victim of chicanery and that the\r\n      apparition is not actually a visitant from the old world of\r\n      shadows it is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt\r\n      have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation and that\r\n      the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about is\r\n      to be attributed even in the cases most in point and where most\r\n      suffering has been experienced more to a kind of anticipative\r\n      horror lest the apparition might possibly be real than to an\r\n      unwavering belief in its reality but in the present instance\r\n      it will be seen immediately that in the minds of the mutineers\r\n      there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a\r\n      doubt that the apparition of rogers was indeed a revivification\r\n      of his disgusting corpse or at least its spiritual image the\r\n      isolated situation of the brig with its entire inaccessibility\r\n      on account of the gale confined the apparently possible means of\r\n      deception within such narrow and definite limits that they must\r\n      have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance\r\n      they had now been at sea twentyfour days without holding more\r\n      than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever the whole\r\n      of the crew tooat least all whom they had the most remote\r\n      reason for suspecting to be on boardwere assembled in the cabin\r\n      with the exception of allen the watch and his gigantic stature\r\n      he was six feet six inches high was too familiar in their eyes\r\n      to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to\r\n      enter their minds even for an instant add to these\r\n      considerations the aweinspiring nature of the tempest and that\r\n      of the conversation brought about by peters the deep impression\r\n      which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse had made in the\r\n      morning upon the imaginations of the men the excellence of the\r\n      imitation in my person and the uncertain and wavering light in\r\n      which they beheld me as the glare of the cabin lantern swinging\r\n      violently to and fro fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure\r\n      and there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even\r\n      more than the entire effect which we had anticipated the mate\r\n      sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying and without\r\n      uttering a syllable fell back stone dead upon the cabin floor\r\n      and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the\r\n      brig of the remaining seven there were but three who had at\r\n      first any degree of presence of mind the four others sat for\r\n      some time rooted apparently to the floor the most pitiable\r\n      objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered the\r\n      only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook john\r\n      hunt and richard parker but they made but a feeble and\r\n      irresolute defence the two former were shot instantly by peters\r\n      and i felled parker with a blow on the head from the pumphandle\r\n      which i had brought with me in the meantime augustus seized one\r\n      of the muskets lying on the floor and shot another mutineer\r\n      wilson through the breast there were now but three remaining\r\n      but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy and\r\n      perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon\r\n      them for they fought with great resolution and fury and but\r\n      for the immense muscular strength of peters might have\r\n      ultimately got the better of us these three men werejones\r\n      greely and absolom hicks jones had thrown augustus to the\r\n      floor stabbed him in several places along the right arm and\r\n      would no doubt have soon dispatched him as neither peters nor\r\n      myself could immediately get rid of our own antagonists had it\r\n      not been for the timely aid of a friend upon whose assistance\r\n      we surely had never depended this friend was no other than\r\n      tiger with a low growl he bounded into the cabin at a most\r\n      critical moment for augustus and throwing himself upon jones\r\n      pinned him to the floor in an instant my friend however was\r\n      now too much injured to render us any aid whatever and i was so\r\n      encumbered with my disguise that i could do but little the dog\r\n      would not leave his hold upon the throat of jonespeters\r\n      nevertheless was far more than a match for the two men who\r\n      remained and would no doubt have dispatched them sooner had\r\n      it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act and the\r\n      tremendous lurches of the vessel presently he was enabled to get\r\n      hold of a heavy stool several of which lay about the floor with\r\n      this he beat out the brains of greely as he was in the act of\r\n      discharging a musket at me and immediately afterward a roll of\r\n      the brig throwing him in contact with hicks he seized him by the\r\n      throat and by dint of sheer strength strangled him\r\n      instantaneously thus in far less time than i have taken to tell\r\n      it we found ourselves masters of the brig\r\n\r\n      the only person of our opponents who was left alive was richard\r\n      parker this man it will be remembered i had knocked down with\r\n      a blow from the pumphandle at the commencement of the attack he\r\n      now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom but\r\n      upon peters touching him with his foot he spoke and entreated\r\n      for mercy his head was only slightly cut and otherwise he had\r\n      received no injury having been merely stunned by the blow he\r\n      now got up and for the present we secured his hands behind his\r\n      back the dog was still growling over jones but upon\r\n      examination we found him completely dead the blood issuing in a\r\n      stream from a deep wound in the throat inflicted no doubt by\r\n      the sharp teeth of the animal\r\n\r\n      it was now about one oclock in the morning and the wind was\r\n      still blowing tremendously the brig evidently laboured much more\r\n      than usual and it became absolutely necessary that something\r\n      should be done with a view of easing her in some measure at\r\n      almost every roll to leeward she shipped a sea several of which\r\n      came partially down into the cabin during our scuffle the\r\n      hatchway having been left open by myself when i descended the\r\n      entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away as well\r\n      as the caboose together with the jollyboat from the counter the\r\n      creaking and working of the mainmast too gave indication that\r\n      it was nearly sprung to make room for more stowage in the\r\n      afterhold the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks\r\n      a very reprehensible practice occasionally resorted to by\r\n      ignorant shipbuilders so that it was in imminent danger of\r\n      working from its step but to crown all our difficulties we\r\n      plummed the well and found no less than seven feet of water\r\n\r\n      leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin we got to work\r\n      immediately at the pumpsparker of course being set at liberty\r\n      to assist us in the labour augustuss arm was bound up as well\r\n      as we could effect it and he did what he could but that was not\r\n      much however we found that we could just manage to keep the\r\n      leak from gaining upon us by having one pump constantly going as\r\n      there were only four of us this was severe labour but we\r\n      endeavoured to keep up our spirits and looked anxiously for\r\n      daybreak when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away the\r\n      mainmast\r\n\r\n      in this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue\r\n      and when the day at length broke the gale had neither abated in\r\n      the least nor were there any signs of its abating we now\r\n      dragged the bodies on deck and threw them overboard our next\r\n      care was to get rid of the mainmast the necessary preparations\r\n      having been made peters cut away at the mast having found axes\r\n      in the cabin while the rest of us stood by the stays and\r\n      lanyards as the brig gave a tremendous leelurch the word was\r\n      given to cut away the weatherlanyards which being done the\r\n      whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea clear of the\r\n      brig and without doing any material injury we now found that\r\n      the vessel did not labour quite as much as before but our\r\n      situation was still exceedingly precarious and in spite of the\r\n      utmost exertions we could not gain upon the leak without the aid\r\n      of both pumps the little assistance which augustus could render\r\n      us was not really of any importance to add to our distress a\r\n      heavy sea striking the brig to the windward threw her off\r\n      several points from the wind and before she could regain her\r\n      position another broke completely over her and hurled her full\r\n      upon her beamends the ballast now shifted in a mass to leeward\r\n      the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for some\r\n      time and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us\r\n      from capsizing presently however we partially righted but the\r\n      ballast still retaining its place to larboard we lay so much\r\n      along that it was useless to think of working the pumps which\r\n      indeed we could not have done much longer in any case as our\r\n      hands were entirely raw with the excessive labour we had\r\n      undergone and were bleeding in the most horrible manner\r\n\r\n      contrary to parkers advice we now proceeded to cut away the\r\n      foremast and at length accomplished it after much difficulty\r\n      owing to the position in which we lay in going overboard the\r\n      wreck took with it the bowsprit and left us a complete hulk\r\n\r\n      so far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our\r\n      longboat which had received no damage from any of the huge seas\r\n      which had come on board but we had not long to congratulate\r\n      ourselves for the foremast having gone and of course the\r\n      foresail with it by which the brig had been steadied every sea\r\n      now made a complete breach over us and in five minutes our deck\r\n      was swept from stem to stern the longboat and starboard bulwarks\r\n      torn off and even the windlass shattered into fragments it was\r\n      indeed hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable\r\n      condition\r\n\r\n      at noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gales\r\n      abating but in this we were sadly disappointed for it only\r\n      lulled for a few minutes to blow with redoubled fury about four\r\n      in the afternoon it was utterly impossible to stand up against\r\n      the violence of the blast and as the night closed in upon us i\r\n      had not a shadow of hope that the vessel would hold together\r\n      until morning\r\n\r\n      by midnight we had settled very deep in the water which was now\r\n      up to the orlop deck the rudder went soon afterward the sea\r\n      which tore it away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely\r\n      from the water against which she thumped in her descent with\r\n      such a concussion as would be occasioned by going ashore we had\r\n      all calculated that the rudder would hold its own to the last as\r\n      it was unusually strong being rigged as i have never seen one\r\n      rigged either before or since down its main timber there ran a\r\n      succession of stout iron hooks and others in the same manner\r\n      down the sternpost through these hooks there extended a very\r\n      thick wroughtiron rod the rudder being thus held to the\r\n      sternpost and swinging freely on the rod the tremendous force\r\n      of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact that\r\n      the hooks in the sternpost which ran entirely through it being\r\n      clinched on the inside were drawn every one of them completely\r\n      out of the solid wood\r\n\r\n      we had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this\r\n      shock when one of the most tremendous waves i had then ever\r\n      known broke right on board of us sweeping the companionway\r\n      clear off bursting in the hatchways and filling every inch of\r\n      the vessel with water\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      luckily just before night all four of us had lashed ourselves\r\n      firmly to the fragments of the windlass lying in this manner as\r\n      flat upon the deck as possible this precaution alone saved us\r\n      from destruction as it was we were all more or less stunned by\r\n      the immense weight of water which tumbled upon us and which did\r\n      not roll from above us until we were nearly exhausted as soon as\r\n      i could recover breath i called aloud to my companions augustus\r\n      alone replied saying it is all over with us and may god have\r\n      mercy upon our souls byandby both the others were enabled to\r\n      speak when they exhorted us to take courage as there was still\r\n      hope it being impossible from the nature of the cargo that the\r\n      brig could go down and there being every chance that the gale\r\n      would blow over by the morning these words inspired me with new\r\n      life for strange as it may seem although it was obvious that a\r\n      vessel with a cargo of empty oilcasks would not sink i had been\r\n      hitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this\r\n      consideration altogether and the danger which i had for some\r\n      time regarded as the most imminent was that of foundering as\r\n      hope revived within me i made use of every opportunity to\r\n      strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains of the\r\n      windlass and in this occupation i soon discovered that my\r\n      companions were also busy the night was as dark as it could\r\n      possibly be and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which\r\n      surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing our deck lay\r\n      level with the sea or rather we were encircled with a towering\r\n      ridge of foam a portion of which swept over us every instant it\r\n      is not too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of the\r\n      water more than one second in three although we lay close\r\n      together no one of us could see the other or indeed any\r\n      portion of the brig itself upon which we were so tempestuously\r\n      hurled about at intervals we called one to the other thus\r\n      endeavouring to keep alive hope and render consolation and\r\n      encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it the\r\n      feeble condition of augustus made him an object of solicitude\r\n      with us all and as from the lacerated condition of his right\r\n      arm it must have been impossible for him to secure his lashings\r\n      with any degree of firmness we were in momentary expectation of\r\n      finding that he had gone overboardyet to render him aid was a\r\n      thing altogether out of the question fortunately his station\r\n      was more secure than that of any of the rest of us for the upper\r\n      part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered\r\n      windlass the seas as they tumbled in upon him were greatly\r\n      broken in their violence in any other situation than this into\r\n      which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed himself\r\n      in a very exposed spot he must inevitably have perished before\r\n      morning owing to the brigs lying so much along we were all\r\n      less liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the\r\n      case the heel as i have before stated was to larboard about\r\n      one half of the deck being constantly under water the seas\r\n      therefore which struck us to starboard were much broken by the\r\n      vessels side only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on\r\n      our faces while those which came from larboard being what are\r\n      called backwater seas and obtaining little hold upon us on\r\n      account of our posture had not sufficient force to drag us from\r\n      our fastenings\r\n\r\n      in this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to\r\n      show us more fully the horrors which surrounded us the brig was\r\n      a mere log rolling about at the mercy of every wave the gale\r\n      was upon the increase if any thing blowing indeed a complete\r\n      hurricane and there appeared to us no earthly prospect of\r\n      deliverance for several hours we held on in silence expecting\r\n      every moment that our lashings would either give way that the\r\n      remains of the windlass would go by the board or that some of\r\n      the huge seas which roared in every direction around us and\r\n      above us would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we\r\n      should be drowned before it could regain the surface by the\r\n      mercy of god however we were preserved from these imminent\r\n      dangers and about midday were cheered by the light of the\r\n      blessed sun shortly afterward we could perceive a sensible\r\n      diminution in the force of the wind when now for the first time\r\n      since the latter part of the evening before augustus spoke\r\n      asking peters who lay closest to him if he thought there was\r\n      any possibility of our being saved as no reply was at first made\r\n      to this question we all concluded that the hybrid had been\r\n      drowned where he lay but presently to our great joy he spoke\r\n      although very feebly saying that he was in great pain being so\r\n      cut by the tightness of his lashings across the stomach that he\r\n      must either find means of loosening them or perish as it was\r\n      impossible that he could endure his misery much longer this\r\n      occasioned us great distress as it was altogether useless to\r\n      think of aiding him in any manner while the sea continued washing\r\n      over us as it did we exhorted him to bear his sufferings with\r\n      fortitude and promised to seize the first opportunity which\r\n      should offer itself to relieve him he replied that it would soon\r\n      be too late that it would be all over with him before we could\r\n      help him and then after moaning for some minutes lay silent\r\n      when we concluded that he had perished\r\n\r\n      as the evening drew on the sea had fallen so much that scarcely\r\n      more than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the\r\n      course of five minutes and the wind had abated a great deal\r\n      although still blowing a severe gale i had not heard any of my\r\n      companions speak for hours and now called to augustus he\r\n      replied although very feebly so that i could not distinguish\r\n      what he said i then spoke to peters and to parker neither of\r\n      whom returned any answer\r\n\r\n      shortly after this period i fell into a state of partial\r\n      insensibility during which the most pleasing images floated in\r\n      my imagination such as green trees waving meadows of ripe\r\n      grain processions of dancing girls troops of cavalry and other\r\n      phantasies i now remember that in all which passed before my\r\n      minds eye motion was a predominant idea thus i never fancied\r\n      any stationary object such as a house a mountain or any thing\r\n      of that kind but windmills ships large birds balloons people\r\n      on horseback carriages driving furiously and similar moving\r\n      objects presented themselves in endless succession when i\r\n      recovered from this state the sun was as near as i could guess\r\n      an hour high i had the greatest difficulty in bringing to\r\n      recollection the various circumstances connected with my\r\n      situation and for some time remained firmly convinced that i was\r\n      still in the hold of the brig near the box and that the body of\r\n      parker was that of tiger\r\n\r\n      when i at length completely came to my senses i found that the\r\n      wind blew no more than a moderate breeze and that the sea was\r\n      comparatively calm so much so that it only washed over the brig\r\n      amidships my left arm had broken loose from its lashings and\r\n      was much cut about the elbow my right was entirely benumbed and\r\n      the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the pressure of the\r\n      rope which had worked from the shoulder downward i was also in\r\n      great pain from another rope which went about my waist and had\r\n      been drawn to an insufferable degree of tightness looking round\r\n      upon my companions i saw that peters still lived although a\r\n      thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him\r\n      the appearance of being cut nearly in two as i stirred he made\r\n      a feeble motion to me with his hand pointing to the rope\r\n      augustus gave no indication of life whatever and was bent nearly\r\n      double across a splinter of the windlass parker spoke to me when\r\n      he saw me moving and asked me if i had not sufficient strength\r\n      to release him from his situation saying that if i would summon\r\n      up what spirits i could and contrive to untie him we might yet\r\n      save our lives but that otherwise we must all perish i told him\r\n      to take courage and i would endeavor to free him feeling in my\r\n      pantaloons pocket i got hold of my penknife and after several\r\n      ineffectual attempts at length succeeded in opening it i then\r\n      with my left hand managed to free my right from its fastenings\r\n      and afterward cut the other ropes which held me upon attempting\r\n      however to move from my position i found that my legs failed me\r\n      altogether and that i could not get up neither could i move my\r\n      right arm in any direction upon mentioning this to parker he\r\n      advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes holding on to the\r\n      windlass with my left hand so as to allow time for the blood to\r\n      circulate doing this the numbness presently began to die away\r\n      so that i could move first one of my legs and then the other\r\n      and shortly afterward i regained the partial use of my right\r\n      arm i now crawled with great caution toward parker without\r\n      getting on my legs and soon cut loose all the lashings about\r\n      him when after a short delay he also recovered the partial use\r\n      of his limbs we now lost no time in getting loose the rope from\r\n      peters it had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his\r\n      woollen pantaloons and through two shirts and made its way into\r\n      his groin from which the blood flowed out copiously as we\r\n      removed the cordage no sooner had we removed it however than\r\n      he spoke and seemed to experience instant reliefbeing able to\r\n      move with much greater ease than either parker or myselfthis was\r\n      no doubt owing to the discharge of blood\r\n\r\n      we had little hopes that augustus would recover as he evinced no\r\n      signs of life but upon getting to him we discovered that he\r\n      had merely swooned from the loss of blood the bandages we had\r\n      placed around his wounded arm having been torn off by the water\r\n      none of the ropes which held him to the windlass were drawn\r\n      sufficiently tight to occasion his death having relieved him\r\n      from the fastenings and got him clear of the broken wood about\r\n      the windlass we secured him in a dry place to windward with his\r\n      head somewhat lower than his body and all three of us busied\r\n      ourselves in chafing his limbs in about half an hour he came to\r\n      himself although it was not until the next morning that he gave\r\n      signs of recognizing any of us or had sufficient strength to\r\n      speak by the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was\r\n      quite dark and it began to cloud up so that we were again in\r\n      the greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard in which\r\n      event nothing could have saved us from perishing exhausted as we\r\n      were by good fortune it continued very moderate during the\r\n      night the sea subsiding every minute which gave us great hopes\r\n      of ultimate preservation a gentle breeze still blew from the n\r\n      w but the weather was not at all cold augustus was lashed\r\n      carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from\r\n      slipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel as he was still\r\n      too weak to hold on at all for ourselves there was no such\r\n      necessity we sat close together supporting each other with the\r\n      aid of the broken ropes about the windlass and devising methods\r\n      of escape from our frightful situation we derived much comfort\r\n      from taking off our clothes and wringing the water from them\r\n      when we put them on after this they felt remarkably warm and\r\n      pleasant and served to invigorate us in no little degree we\r\n      helped augustus off with his and wrung them for him when he\r\n      experienced the same comfort\r\n\r\n      our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst and\r\n      when we looked forward to the means of relief in this respect\r\n      our hearts sunk within us and we were induced to regret that we\r\n      had escaped the less dreadful perils of the sea we endeavoured\r\n      however to console ourselves with the hope of being speedily\r\n      picked up by some vessel and encouraged each other to bear with\r\n      fortitude the evils that might happen\r\n\r\n      the morning of the fourteenth at length dawned and the weather\r\n      still continued clear and pleasant with a steady but very light\r\n      breeze from the n w the sea was now quite smooth and as from\r\n      some cause which we could not determine the brig did not lie so\r\n      much along as she had done before the deck was comparatively\r\n      dry and we could move about with freedom we had now been better\r\n      than three entire days and nights without either food or drink\r\n      and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an attempt\r\n      to get up something from below as the brig was completely full\r\n      of water we went to this work despondently and with but little\r\n      expectation of being able to obtain anything we made a kind of\r\n      drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of\r\n      the companionhatch into two pieces of wood tying these across\r\n      each other and fastening them to the end of a rope we threw\r\n      them into the cabin and dragged them to and fro in the faint\r\n      hope of being thus able to entangle some article which might be\r\n      of use to us for food or which might at least render us\r\n      assistance in getting it we spent the greater part of the\r\n      morning in this labour without effect fishing up nothing more\r\n      than a few bedclothes which were readily caught by the nails\r\n      indeed our contrivance was so very clumsy that any greater\r\n      success was hardly to be anticipated\r\n\r\n      we now tried the forecastle but equally in vain and were upon\r\n      the brink of despair when peters proposed that we should fasten\r\n      a rope to his body and let him make an attempt to get up\r\n      something by diving into the cabin this proposition we hailed\r\n      with all the delight which reviving hope could inspire he\r\n      proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the exception\r\n      of his pantaloons and a strong rope was then carefully fastened\r\n      around his middle being brought up over his shoulders in such a\r\n      manner that there was no possibility of its slipping the\r\n      undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger for as we\r\n      could hardly expect to find much if any provision in the cabin\r\n      itself it was necessary that the diver after letting himself\r\n      down should make a turn to the right and proceed under water a\r\n      distance of ten or twelve feet in a narrow passage to the\r\n      storeroom and return without drawing breath\r\n\r\n      everything being ready peters now descended in the cabin going\r\n      down the companionladder until the water reached his chin he\r\n      then plunged in head first turning to the right as he plunged\r\n      and endeavouring to make his way to the storeroom in this first\r\n      attempt however he was altogether unsuccessful in less than\r\n      half a minute after his going down we felt the rope jerked\r\n      violently the signal we had agreed upon when he desired to be\r\n      drawn up we accordingly drew him up instantly but so\r\n      incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder he had\r\n      brought nothing with him and had been unable to penetrate more\r\n      than a very little way into the passage owing to the constant\r\n      exertions he found it necessary to make in order to keep himself\r\n      from floating up against the deck upon getting out he was very\r\n      much exhausted and had to rest full fifteen minutes before he\r\n      could again venture to descend\r\n\r\n      the second attempt met with even worse success for he remained\r\n      so long under water without giving the signal that becoming\r\n      alarmed for his safety we drew him out without it and found\r\n      that he was almost at the last gasp having as he said\r\n      repeatedly jerked at the rope without our feeling it this was\r\n      probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the\r\n      balustrade at the foot of the ladder this balustrade was\r\n      indeed so much in the way that we determined to remove it if\r\n      possible before proceeding with our design as we had no means\r\n      of getting it away except by main force we all descended into\r\n      the water as far as we could on the ladder and giving a pull\r\n      against it with our united strength succeeded in breaking it\r\n      down\r\n\r\n      the third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first\r\n      and it now became evident that nothing could be done in this\r\n      manner without the aid of some weight with which the diver might\r\n      steady himself and keep to the floor of the cabin while making\r\n      his search for a long time we looked about in vain for something\r\n      which might answer this purpose but at length to our great joy\r\n      we discovered one of the weatherforechains so loose that we had\r\n      not the least difficulty in wrenching it off having fastened\r\n      this securely to one of his ankles peters now made his fourth\r\n      descent into the cabin and this time succeeded in making his way\r\n      to the door of the stewards room to his inexpressible grief\r\n      however he found it locked and was obliged to return without\r\n      effecting an entrance as with the greatest exertion he could\r\n      remain under water not more at the utmost extent than a single\r\n      minute our affairs now looked gloomy indeed and neither\r\n      augustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears as we\r\n      thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us and the\r\n      slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape\r\n      but this weakness was not of long duration throwing ourselves on\r\n      our knees to god we implored his aid in the many dangers which\r\n      beset us and arose with renewed hope and vigor to think what\r\n      could yet be done by mortal means toward accomplishing our\r\n      deliverance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      shortly afterward an incident occurred which i am induced to look\r\n      upon as more intensely productive of emotion as far more replete\r\n      with the extremes first of delight and then of horror than even\r\n      any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine\r\n      long years crowded with events of the most startling and in\r\n      many cases of the most unconceived and unconceivable character\r\n      we were lying on the deck near the companionway and debating\r\n      the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom when\r\n      looking toward augustus who lay fronting myself i perceived\r\n      that he had become all at once deadly pale and that his lips\r\n      were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner\r\n      greatly alarmed i spoke to him but he made me no reply and i\r\n      was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill when i\r\n      took notice of his eyes which were glaring apparently at some\r\n      object behind me i turned my head and shall never forget the\r\n      ecstatic joy which thrilled through every particle of my frame\r\n      when i perceived a large brig bearing down upon us and not more\r\n      than a couple of miles off i sprung to my feet as if a musket\r\n      bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart and stretching out\r\n      my arms in the direction of the vessel stood in this manner\r\n      motionless and unable to articulate a syllable peters and\r\n      parker were equally affected although in different ways the\r\n      former danced about the deck like a madman uttering the most\r\n      extravagant rhodomontades intermingled with howls and\r\n      imprecations while the latter burst into tears and continued\r\n      for many minutes weeping like a child\r\n\r\n      the vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig of a dutch\r\n      build and painted black with a tawdry gilt figurehead she had\r\n      evidently seen a good deal of rough weather and we supposed\r\n      had suffered much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to\r\n      ourselves for her foretopmast was gone and some of her\r\n      starboard bulwarks when we first saw her she was as i have\r\n      already said about two miles off and to windward bearing down\r\n      upon us the breeze was very gentle and what astonished us\r\n      chiefly was that she had no other sails set than her foremast\r\n      and mainsail with a flying jibof course she came down but\r\n      slowly and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy the\r\n      awkward manner in which she steered too was remarked by all of\r\n      us even excited as we were she yawed about so considerably\r\n      that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us or\r\n      imagined that having seen us and discovered no person on board\r\n      she was about to tack and make off in another direction upon\r\n      each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our\r\n      voices when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her\r\n      intention and again hold on toward usthis singular conduct\r\n      being repeated two or three times so that at last we could think\r\n      of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the\r\n      helmsman to be in liquor\r\n\r\n      no person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about\r\n      a quarter of a mile of us we then saw three seamen whom by\r\n      their dress we took to be hollanders two of these were lying on\r\n      some old sails near the forecastle and the third who appeared\r\n      to be looking at us with great curiosity was leaning over the\r\n      starboard bow near the bowsprit this last was a stout and tall\r\n      man with a very dark skin he seemed by his manner to be\r\n      encouraging us to have patience nodding to us in a cheerful\r\n      although rather odd way and smiling constantly so as to display\r\n      a set of the most brilliantly white teeth as his vessel drew\r\n      nearer we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his\r\n      head into the water but of this he took little or no notice\r\n      continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations i relate these\r\n      things and circumstances minutely and i relate them it must be\r\n      understood precisely as they appearedto us\r\n\r\n      the brig came on slowly and now more steadily than before andi\r\n      cannot speak calmly of this eventour hearts leaped up wildly\r\n      within us and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and\r\n      thanksgiving to god for the complete unexpected and glorious\r\n      deliverance that was so palpably at hand of a sudden and all at\r\n      once there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel\r\n      which was now close upon us a smell a stench such as the\r\n      whole world has no name forno conception ofhellishutterly\r\n      suffocatinginsufferable inconceivable i gasped for breath and\r\n      turning to my companions perceived that they were paler than\r\n      marble but we had now no time left for question or surmisethe\r\n      brig was within fifty feet of us and it seemed to be her\r\n      intention to run under our counter that we might board her\r\n      without putting out a boat we rushed aft when suddenly a wide\r\n      yaw threw her off full five or six points from the course she had\r\n      been running and as she passed under our stern at the distance\r\n      of about twenty feet we had a full view of her decks shall i\r\n      ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle twentyfive or\r\n      thirty human bodies among whom were several females lay\r\n      scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last\r\n      and most loathsome state of putrefaction we plainly saw that not\r\n      a soul lived in that fated vessel yet we could not help shouting\r\n      to the dead for help yes long and loudly did we beg in the\r\n      agony of the moment that those silent and disgusting images\r\n      would stay for us would not abandon us to become like them\r\n      would receive us among their goodly company we were raving with\r\n      horror and despairthoroughly mad through the anguish of our\r\n      grievous disappointment\r\n\r\n      as our first loud yell of terror broke forth it was replied to\r\n      by something from near the bowsprit of the stranger so closely\r\n      resembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might\r\n      have been startled and deceived at this instant another sudden\r\n      yaw brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view\r\n      and we beheld at once the origin of the sound we saw the tall\r\n      stout figure still leaning on the bulwark and still nodding his\r\n      head to and fro but his face was now turned from us so that we\r\n      could not behold it his arms were extended over the rail and\r\n      the palms of his hands fell outward his knees were lodged upon a\r\n      stout rope tightly stretched and reaching from the heel of the\r\n      bowsprit to a cathead on his back from which a portion of the\r\n      shirt had been torn leaving it bare there sat a huge seagull\r\n      busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh its bill and\r\n      talons deep buried and its white plumage spattered all over with\r\n      blood as the brig moved farther round so as to bring us close in\r\n      view the bird with much apparent difficulty drew out its\r\n      crimsoned head and after eyeing us for a moment as if\r\n      stupefied arose lazily from the body upon which it had been\r\n      feasting and flying directly above our deck hovered there a\r\n      while with a portion of clotted and liverlike substance in its\r\n      beak the horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash\r\n      immediately at the feet of parker may god forgive me but now\r\n      for the first time there flashed through my mind a thought a\r\n      thought which i will not mention and i felt myself making a step\r\n      toward the ensanguined spot i looked upward and the eyes of\r\n      augustus met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning\r\n      which immediately brought me to my senses i sprang forward\r\n      quickly and with a deep shudder threw the frightful thing into\r\n      the sea\r\n\r\n      the body from which it had been taken resting as it did upon the\r\n      rope had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the\r\n      carnivorous bird and it was this motion which had at first\r\n      impressed us with the belief of its being alive as the gull\r\n      relieved it of its weight it swung round and fell partially\r\n      over so that the face was fully discovered never surely was\r\n      any object so terribly full of awe the eyes were gone and the\r\n      whole flesh around the mouth leaving the teeth utterly naked\r\n      this then was the smile which had cheered us on to hope this\r\n      thebut i forbear the brig as i have already told passed under\r\n      our stern and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward with\r\n      her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of\r\n      deliverance and joy deliberately as she went by we might\r\n      possibly have found means of boarding her had not our sudden\r\n      disappointment and the appalling nature of the discovery which\r\n      accompanied it laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of\r\n      mind and body we had seen and felt but we could neither think\r\n      nor act until alas too late how much our intellects had been\r\n      weakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact that when\r\n      the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more\r\n      than the half of her hull the proposition was seriously\r\n      entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming\r\n\r\n      i have since this period vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew\r\n      to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the\r\n      stranger her build and general appearance as i have before\r\n      stated led us to the belief that she was a dutch trader and the\r\n      dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion we might have\r\n      easily seen the name upon her stern and indeed taken other\r\n      observations which would have guided us in making out her\r\n      character but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to\r\n      every thing of that nature from the saffronlike hue of such of\r\n      the corpses as were not entirely decayed we concluded that the\r\n      whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever or some\r\n      other virulent disease of the same fearful kind if such were the\r\n      case and i know not what else to imagine death to judge from\r\n      the positions of the bodies must have come upon them in a manner\r\n      awfully sudden and overwhelming in a way totally distinct from\r\n      that which generally characterizes even the most deadly\r\n      pestilences with which mankind are acquainted it is possible\r\n      indeed that poison accidentally introduced into some of their\r\n      seastores may have brought about the disaster or that the\r\n      eating of some unknown venomous species of fish or other marine\r\n      animal or oceanic bird might have induced itbut it is utterly\r\n      useless to form conjectures where all is involved and will no\r\n      doubt remain for ever involved in the most appalling and\r\n      unfathomable mystery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      we spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid\r\n      lethargy gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness\r\n      hiding her from our sight recalled us in some measure to our\r\n      senses the pangs of hunger and thirst then returned absorbing\r\n      all other cares and considerations nothing however could be\r\n      done until the morning and securing ourselves as well as\r\n      possible we endeavoured to snatch a little repose in this i\r\n      succeeded beyond my expectations sleeping until my companions\r\n      who had not been so fortunate aroused me at daybreak to renew\r\n      our attempts at getting up provisions from the hull\r\n\r\n      it was now a dead calm with the sea as smooth as i have ever\r\n      known itthe weather warm and pleasant the brig was out of\r\n      sight we commenced our operations by wrenching off with some\r\n      trouble another of the forechains and having fastened both to\r\n      peters feet he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the\r\n      storeroom thinking it possible that he might be able to force it\r\n      open provided he could get at it in sufficient time and this he\r\n      hoped to do as the hulk lay much more steadily than before\r\n\r\n      he succeeded very quickly in reaching the door when loosening\r\n      one of the chains from his ankle he made every exertion to force\r\n      the passage with it but in vain the framework of the room being\r\n      far stronger than was anticipated he was quite exhausted with\r\n      his long stay under water and it became absolutely necessary\r\n      that some other one of us should take his place for this service\r\n      parker immediately volunteered but after making three\r\n      ineffectual efforts found that he could never even succeed in\r\n      getting near the door the condition of augustuss wounded arm\r\n      rendered it useless for him to attempt going down as he would be\r\n      unable to force the room open should he reach it and it\r\n      accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common\r\n      deliverance\r\n\r\n      peters had left one of the chains in the passage and i found\r\n      upon plunging in that i had not sufficient balance to keep me\r\n      firmly down i determined therefore to attempt no more in my\r\n      first effort than merely to recover the other chain in groping\r\n      along the floor of the passage for this i felt a hard substance\r\n      which i immediately grasped not having time to ascertain what it\r\n      was but returning and ascending instantly to the surface the\r\n      prize proved to be a bottle and our joy may be conceived when i\r\n      say that it was found to be full of port wine giving thanks to\r\n      god for this timely and cheering assistance we immediately drew\r\n      the cork with my penknife and each taking a moderate sup felt\r\n      the most indescribable comfort from the warmth strength and\r\n      spirits with which it inspired us we then carefully recorked the\r\n      bottle and by means of a handkerchief swung it in such a\r\n      manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken\r\n\r\n      having rested a while after this fortunate discovery i again\r\n      descended and now recovered the chain with which i instantly\r\n      came up i then fastened it on and went down for the third time\r\n      when i became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever in that\r\n      situation would enable me to force open the door of the\r\n      storeroom i therefore returned in despair\r\n\r\n      there seemed now to be no longer any room for hope and i could\r\n      perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made\r\n      up their minds to perish the wine had evidently produced in them\r\n      a species of delirium which perhaps i had been prevented from\r\n      feeling by the immersion i had undergone since drinking it they\r\n      talked incoherently and about matters unconnected with our\r\n      condition peters repeatedly asking me questions about nantucket\r\n      augustus too i remember approached me with a serious air and\r\n      requested me to lend him a pocketcomb as his hair was full of\r\n      fishscales and he wished to get them out before going on shore\r\n      parker appeared somewhat less affected and urged me to dive at\r\n      random into the cabin and bring up any article which might come\r\n      to hand to this i consented and in the first attempt after\r\n      staying under a full minute brought up a small leather trunk\r\n      belonging to captain barnard this was immediately opened in the\r\n      faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink we\r\n      found nothing however except a box of razors and two linen\r\n      shirts i now went down again and returned without any success\r\n      as my head came above water i heard a crash on deck and upon\r\n      getting up saw that my companions had ungratefully taken\r\n      advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine\r\n      having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before\r\n      i saw them i remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of\r\n      their conduct when augustus burst into tears the other two\r\n      endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke but i hope never\r\n      again to behold laughter of such a species the distortion of\r\n      countenance was absolutely frightful indeed it was apparent\r\n      that the stimulus in the empty state of their stomachs had\r\n      taken instant and violent effect and that they were all\r\n      exceedingly intoxicated with great difficulty i prevailed upon\r\n      them to lie down when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber\r\n      accompanied with loud stertorous breathing\r\n\r\n      i now found myself as it were alone in the brig and my\r\n      reflections to be sure were of the most fearful and gloomy\r\n      nature no prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering\r\n      death by famine or at the best by being overwhelmed in the\r\n      first gale which should spring up for in our present exhausted\r\n      condition we could have no hope of living through another\r\n\r\n      the gnawing hunger which i now experienced was nearly\r\n      insupportable and i felt myself capable of going to any lengths\r\n      in order to appease it with my knife i cut off a small portion\r\n      of the leather trunk and endeavoured to eat it but found it\r\n      utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel although i fancied\r\n      that some little alleviation of my suffering was obtained by\r\n      chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out toward night my\r\n      companions awoke one by one each in an indescribable state of\r\n      weakness and horror brought on by the wine whose fumes had now\r\n      evaporated they shook as if with a violent ague and uttered the\r\n      most lamentable cries for water their condition affected me in\r\n      the most lively degree at the same time causing me to rejoice in\r\n      the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from\r\n      indulging in the wine and consequently from sharing their\r\n      melancholy and most distressing sensations their conduct\r\n      however gave me great uneasiness and alarm for it was evident\r\n      that unless some favourable change took place they could afford\r\n      me no assistance in providing for our common safety i had not\r\n      yet abandoned all idea of being able to get up something from\r\n      below but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some\r\n      one of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by\r\n      holding the end of the rope while i went down parker appeared to\r\n      be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others and\r\n      i endeavoured by every means in my power to rouse him thinking\r\n      that a plunge in the seawater might have a beneficial effect i\r\n      contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body and then\r\n      leading him to the companionway he remaining quite passive all\r\n      the while pushed him in and immediately drew him out i had\r\n      good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this\r\n      experiment for he appeared much revived and invigorated and\r\n      upon getting out asked me in a rational manner why i had so\r\n      served him having explained my object he expressed himself\r\n      indebted to me and said that he felt greatly better from the\r\n      immersion afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation we\r\n      then resolved to treat augustus and peters in the same way which\r\n      we immediately did when they both experienced much benefit from\r\n      the shock this idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me\r\n      by reading in some medical work the good effect of the\r\n      showerbath in a case where the patient was suffering from mania\r\n      a potu\r\n\r\n      finding that i could now trust my companions to hold the end of\r\n      the rope i again made three or four plunges into the cabin\r\n      although it was now quite dark and a gentle but long swell from\r\n      the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady in the course\r\n      of these attempts i succeeded in bringing up two caseknives a\r\n      threegallon jug empty and a blanket but nothing which could\r\n      serve us for food i continued my efforts after getting these\r\n      articles until i was completely exhausted but brought up\r\n      nothing else during the night parker and peters occupied\r\n      themselves by turns in the same manner but nothing coming to\r\n      hand we now gave up this attempt in despair concluding that we\r\n      were exhausting ourselves in vain\r\n\r\n      we passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most\r\n      intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined\r\n      the morning of the sixteenth at length dawned and we looked\r\n      eagerly around the horizon for relief but to no purpose the sea\r\n      was still smooth with only a long swell from the northward as\r\n      on yesterday this was the sixth day since we had tasted either\r\n      food or drink with the exception of the bottle of port wine and\r\n      it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while\r\n      longer unless something could be obtained i never saw before\r\n      nor wish to see again human beings so utterly emaciated as\r\n      peters and augustus had i met them on shore in their present\r\n      condition i should not have had the slightest suspicion that i\r\n      had ever beheld them their countenances were totally changed in\r\n      character so that i could not bring myself to believe them\r\n      really the same individuals with whom i had been in company but a\r\n      few days before parker although sadly reduced and so feeble\r\n      that he could not raise his head from his bosom was not so far\r\n      gone as the other two he suffered with great patience making no\r\n      complaint and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every\r\n      manner he could devise for myself although at the commencement\r\n      of the voyage i had been in bad health and was at all times of a\r\n      delicate constitution i suffered less than any of us being much\r\n      less reduced in frame and retaining my powers of mind in a\r\n      surprising degree while the rest were completely prostrated in\r\n      intellect and seemed to be brought to a species of second\r\n      childhood generally simpering in their expressions with idiotic\r\n      smiles and uttering the most absurd platitudes at intervals\r\n      however they would appear to revive suddenly as if inspired all\r\n      at once with a consciousness of their condition when they would\r\n      spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour and speak\r\n      for a short period of their prospects in a manner altogether\r\n      rational although full of the most intense despair it is\r\n      possible however that my companions may have entertained the\r\n      same opinion of their own condition as i did of mine and that i\r\n      may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and\r\n      imbecilities as themselvesthis is a matter which cannot be\r\n      determined\r\n\r\n      about noon parker declared that he saw land off the larboard\r\n      quarter and it was with the utmost difficulty i could restrain\r\n      him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming toward\r\n      it peters and augustus took little notice of what he said being\r\n      apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation upon looking in the\r\n      direction pointed out i could not perceive the faintest\r\n      appearance of the shoreindeed i was too well aware that we were\r\n      far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature it was a\r\n      long time nevertheless before i could convince parker of his\r\n      mistake he then burst into a flood of tears weeping like a\r\n      child with loud cries and sobs for two or three hours when\r\n      becoming exhausted he fell asleep\r\n\r\n      peters and augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to\r\n      swallow portions of the leather i advised them to chew it and\r\n      spit it out but they were too excessively debilitated to be able\r\n      to follow my advice i continued to chew pieces of it at\r\n      intervals and found some relief from so doing my chief distress\r\n      was for water and i was only prevented from taking a draught\r\n      from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus\r\n      have resulted to others who were similarly situated with\r\n      ourselves\r\n\r\n      the day wore on in this manner when i suddenly discovered a sail\r\n      to the eastward and on our larboard bow she appeared to be a\r\n      large ship and was coming nearly athwart us being probably\r\n      twelve or fifteen miles distant none of my companions had as yet\r\n      discovered her and i forbore to tell them of her for the\r\n      present lest we might again be disappointed of relief at length\r\n      upon her getting nearer i saw distinctly that she was heading\r\n      immediately for us with her light sails filled i could now\r\n      contain myself no longer and pointed her out to my\r\n      fellowsufferers they immediately sprang to their feet again\r\n      indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy weeping\r\n      laughing in an idiotic manner jumping stamping upon the deck\r\n      tearing their hair and praying and cursing by turns i was so\r\n      affected by their conduct as well as by what i considered a sure\r\n      prospect of deliverance that i could not refrain from joining in\r\n      with their madness and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude\r\n      and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck clapping my hands\r\n      shouting and other similar acts until i was suddenly called to\r\n      my recollection and once more to the extreme human misery and\r\n      despair by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully\r\n      presented toward us and steering in a direction nearly opposite\r\n      to that in which i had at first perceived her\r\n\r\n      it was some time before i could induce my poor companions to\r\n      believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken\r\n      place they replied to all my assertions with a stare and a\r\n      gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such\r\n      misrepresentations the conduct of augustus most sensibly\r\n      affected me in spite of all i could say or do to the contrary\r\n      he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us and\r\n      in making preparations to go on board of her some seaweed\r\n      floating by the brig he maintained that it was the ships boat\r\n      and endeavoured to throw himself upon it howling and shrieking\r\n      in the most heartrending manner when i forcibly restrained him\r\n      from thus casting himself into the sea\r\n\r\n      having become in some degree pacified we continued to watch the\r\n      ship until we finally lost sight of her the weather becoming\r\n      hazy with a light breeze springing up as soon as she was\r\n      entirely gone parker turned suddenly toward me with an\r\n      expression of countenance which made me shudder there was about\r\n      him an air of selfpossession which i had not noticed in him\r\n      until now and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he\r\n      would say he proposed in a few words that one of us should die\r\n      to preserve the existence of the others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      i had for some time past dwelt upon the prospect of our being\r\n      reduced to this last horrible extremity and had secretly made up\r\n      my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances\r\n      rather than resort to such a course nor was this resolution in\r\n      any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under\r\n      which i laboured the proposition had not been heard by either\r\n      peters or augustus i therefore took parker aside and mentally\r\n      praying to god for power to dissuade him from the horrible\r\n      purpose he entertained i expostulated with him for a long time\r\n      and in the most supplicating manner begging him in the name of\r\n      every thing which he held sacred and urging him by every species\r\n      of argument which the extremity of the case suggested to abandon\r\n      the idea and not to mention it to either of the other two\r\n\r\n      he heard all i said without attempting to controvert any of my\r\n      arguments and i had begun to hope that he would be prevailed\r\n      upon to do as i desired but when i had ceased speaking he said\r\n      that he knew very well all i had said was true and that to\r\n      resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which\r\n      could enter into the mind of man but that he had now held out as\r\n      long as human nature could be sustained that it was unnecessary\r\n      for all to perish when by the death of one it was possible\r\n      and even probable that the rest might be finally preserved\r\n      adding that i might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him\r\n      from his purpose his mind having been thoroughly made up on the\r\n      subject even before the appearance of the ship and that only her\r\n      heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention\r\n      at an earlier period\r\n\r\n      i now begged him if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon\r\n      his design at least to defer it for another day when some\r\n      vessel might come to our relief again reiterating every argument\r\n      i could devise and which i thought likely to have influence with\r\n      one of his rough nature he said in reply that he had not\r\n      spoken until the very last possible moment that he could exist\r\n      no longer without sustenance of some kind and that therefore in\r\n      another day his suggestion would be too late as regarded himself\r\n      at least\r\n\r\n      finding that he was not to be moved by anything i could say in a\r\n      mild tone i now assumed a different demeanor and told him that\r\n      he must be aware i had suffered less than any of us from our\r\n      calamities that my health and strength consequently were at\r\n      that moment far better than his own or than that either of\r\n      peters or augustus in short that i was in a condition to have\r\n      my own way by force if i found it necessary and that if he\r\n      attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody\r\n      and cannibal designs i would not hesitate to throw him into the\r\n      sea upon this he immediately seized me by the throat and\r\n      drawing a knife made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in\r\n      the stomach an atrocity which his excessive debility alone\r\n      prevented him from accomplishing in the meantime being roused\r\n      to a high pitch of anger i forced him to the vessels side with\r\n      the full intention of throwing him overboard he was saved from\r\n      his fate however by the interference of peters who now\r\n      approached and separated us asking the cause of the disturbance\r\n      this parker told before i could find means in any manner to\r\n      prevent him\r\n\r\n      the effect of his words was even more terrible than what i had\r\n      anticipated both augustus and peters who it seems had long\r\n      secretly entertained the same fearful idea which parker had been\r\n      merely the first to broach joined with him in his design and\r\n      insisted upon its immediately being carried into effect i had\r\n      calculated that one at least of the two former would be found\r\n      still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with\r\n      myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose\r\n      and with the aid of either one of them i had no fear of being\r\n      able to prevent its accomplishment being disappointed in this\r\n      expectation it became absolutely necessary that i should attend\r\n      to my own safety as a further resistance on my part might\r\n      possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a\r\n      sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that i\r\n      knew would speedily be enacted\r\n\r\n      i now told them i was willing to submit to the proposal merely\r\n      requesting a delay of about one hour in order that the fog which\r\n      had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting when\r\n      it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in\r\n      sight after great difficulty i obtained from them a promise to\r\n      wait thus long and as i had anticipated a breeze rapidly\r\n      coming in the fog lifted before the hour had expired when no\r\n      vessel appearing in sight we prepared to draw lots\r\n\r\n      it is with extreme reluctance that i dwell upon the appalling\r\n      scene which ensued a scene which with its minutest details no\r\n      after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree\r\n      from my memory and whose stern recollection will embitter every\r\n      future moment of my existence let me run over this portion of my\r\n      narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be\r\n      spoken of will permit the only method we could devise for the\r\n      terrific lottery in which we were to take each a chance was\r\n      that of drawing straws small splinters of wood were made to\r\n      answer our purpose and it was agreed that i should be the\r\n      holder i retired to one end of the hulk while my poor\r\n      companions silently took up their station in the other with their\r\n      backs turned toward me the bitterest anxiety which i endured at\r\n      any period of this fearful drama was while i occupied myself in\r\n      the arrangement of the lots there are few conditions into which\r\n      man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in\r\n      the preservation of his existence an interest momentarily\r\n      increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that\r\n      existence may be held but now that the silent definite and\r\n      stern nature of the business in which i was engaged so different\r\n      from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually\r\n      approaching horrors of famine allowed me to reflect on the few\r\n      chances i had of escaping the most appalling of deathsa death\r\n      for the most appalling of purposesevery particle of that energy\r\n      which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the\r\n      wind leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable\r\n      terror i could not at first even summon up sufficient strength\r\n      to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood my fingers\r\n      absolutely refusing their office and my knees knocking violently\r\n      against each other my mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd\r\n      projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful\r\n      speculation i thought of falling on my knees to my companions\r\n      and entreating them to let me escape this necessity of suddenly\r\n      rushing upon them and by putting one of them to death of\r\n      rendering the decision by lot uselessin short of every thing\r\n      but of going through with the matter i had in hand at last\r\n      after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct i was\r\n      recalled to my senses by the voice of parker who urged me to\r\n      relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were\r\n      enduring even then i could not bring myself to arrange the\r\n      splinters upon the spot but thought over every species of\r\n      finesse by which i could trick some one of my fellowsufferers to\r\n      draw the short straw as it had been agreed that whoever drew the\r\n      shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the\r\n      preservation of the rest before any one condemn me for this\r\n      apparent heartlessness let him be placed in a situation\r\n      precisely similar to my own\r\n\r\n      at length delay was no longer possible and with a heart almost\r\n      bursting from my bosom i advanced to the region of the\r\n      forecastle where my companions were awaiting me i held out my\r\n      hand with the splinters and peters immediately drew he was\r\n      freehis at least was not the shortest and there was now\r\n      another chance against my escape i summoned up all my strength\r\n      and passed the lots to augustus he also drew immediately and he\r\n      also was free and now whether i should live or die the chances\r\n      were no more than precisely even at this moment all the\r\n      fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom and i felt toward my\r\n      poor fellowcreature parker the most intense the most\r\n      diabolical hatred but the feeling did not last and at length\r\n      with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes i held out the two\r\n      remaining splinters toward him it was fully five minutes before\r\n      he could summon resolution to draw during which period of\r\n      heartrending suspense i never once opened my eyes presently one\r\n      of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand the decision was\r\n      then over yet i knew not whether it was for me or against me no\r\n      one spoke and still i dared not satisfy myself by looking at the\r\n      splinter i held peters at length took me by the hand and i\r\n      forced myself to look up when i immediately saw by the\r\n      countenance of parker that i was safe and that he it was who had\r\n      been doomed to suffer gasping for breath i fell senseless to\r\n      the deck\r\n\r\n      i recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of\r\n      the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental\r\n      in bringing it about he made no resistance whatever and was\r\n      stabbed in the back by peters when he fell instantly dead i\r\n      must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued\r\n      such things may be imagined but words have no power to impress\r\n      the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality let it\r\n      suffice to say that having in some measure appeased the raging\r\n      thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim and having\r\n      by common consent taken off the hands feet and head throwing\r\n      them together with the entrails into the sea we devoured the\r\n      rest of the body piecemeal during the four ever memorable days\r\n      of the seventeenth eighteenth nineteenth and twentieth of the\r\n      month\r\n\r\n      on the nineteenth there coming on a smart shower which lasted\r\n      fifteen or twenty minutes we contrived to catch some water by\r\n      means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our\r\n      drag just after the gale the quantity we took in all did not\r\n      amount to more than half a gallon but even this scanty allowance\r\n      supplied us with comparative strength and hope\r\n\r\n      on the twentyfirst we were again reduced to the last necessity\r\n      the weather still remained warm and pleasant with occasional\r\n      fogs and light breezes most usually from n to w\r\n\r\n      on the twentysecond as we were sitting close huddled together\r\n      gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition there flashed\r\n      through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a\r\n      bright gleam of hope i remembered that when the foremast had\r\n      been cut away peters being in the windward chains passed one\r\n      of the axes into my hand requesting me to put it if possible\r\n      in a place of security and that a few minutes before the last\r\n      heavy sea struck the brig and filled her i had taken this axe\r\n      into the forecastle and laid it in one of the larboard berths i\r\n      now thought it possible that by getting at this axe we might\r\n      cut through the deck over the storeroom and thus readily supply\r\n      ourselves with provisions\r\n\r\n      when i communicated this object to my companions they uttered a\r\n      feeble shout of joy and we all proceeded forthwith to the\r\n      forecastle the difficulty of descending here was greater than\r\n      that of going down in the cabin the opening being much smaller\r\n      for it will be remembered that the whole framework about the\r\n      cabin companionhatch had been carried away whereas the\r\n      forecastleway being a simple hatch of only about three feet\r\n      square had remained uninjured i did not hesitate however to\r\n      attempt the descent and a rope being fastened round my body as\r\n      before i plunged boldly in feet foremost made my way quickly\r\n      to the berth and at the first attempt brought up the axe it was\r\n      hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph and the ease with\r\n      which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our\r\n      ultimate preservation\r\n\r\n      we now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of\r\n      rekindled hope peters and myself taking the axe by turns\r\n      augustuss wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any\r\n      degree as we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to\r\n      stand unsupported and could consequently work but a minute or\r\n      two without resting it soon became evident that many long hours\r\n      would be necessary to accomplish our taskthat is to cut an\r\n      opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the\r\n      storeroom this consideration however did not discourage us\r\n      and working all night by the light of the moon we succeeded in\r\n      effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the\r\n      twentythird\r\n\r\n      peters now volunteered to go down and having made all\r\n      arrangements as before he descended and soon returned bringing\r\n      up with him a small jar which to our great joy proved to be\r\n      full of olives having shared these among us and devoured them\r\n      with the greatest avidity we proceeded to let him down again\r\n      this time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations returning\r\n      instantly with a large ham and a bottle of madeira wine of the\r\n      latter we each took a moderate sup having learned by experience\r\n      the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely the ham\r\n      except about two pounds near the bone was not in a condition to\r\n      be eaten having been entirely spoiled by the salt water the\r\n      sound part was divided among us peters and augustus not being\r\n      able to restrain their appetite swallowed theirs upon the\r\n      instant but i was more cautious and ate but a small portion of\r\n      mine dreading the thirst which i knew would ensue we now rested\r\n      a while from our labors which had been intolerably severe\r\n\r\n      by noon feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed we again\r\n      renewed our attempt at getting up provisions peters and myself\r\n      going down alternately and always with more or less success\r\n      until sundown during this interval we had the good fortune to\r\n      bring up altogether four more small jars of olives another\r\n      ham a carboy containing nearly three gallons of excellent cape\r\n      madeira wine and what gave us still more delight a small\r\n      tortoise of the gallipago breed several of which had been taken\r\n      on board by captain barnard as the grampus was leaving port\r\n      from the schooner mary pitts just returned from a sealing\r\n      voyage in the pacific\r\n\r\n      in a subsequent portion of this narrative i shall have frequent\r\n      occasion to mention this species of tortoise it is found\r\n      principally as most of my readers may know in the group of\r\n      islands called the gallipagos which indeed derive their name\r\n      from the animalthe spanish word gallipago meaning a freshwater\r\n      terrapin from the peculiarity of their shape and action they\r\n      have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise they are\r\n      frequently found of an enormous size i have myself seen several\r\n      which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds although\r\n      i do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them\r\n      weighing more than eight hundred their appearance is singular\r\n      and even disgusting their steps are very slow measured and\r\n      heavy their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground\r\n      their neck is long and exceedingly slender from eighteen inches\r\n      to two feet is a very common length and i killed one where the\r\n      distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no\r\n      less than three feet ten inches the head has a striking\r\n      resemblance to that of a serpent they can exist without food for\r\n      an almost incredible length of time instances having been known\r\n      where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain\r\n      two years without nourishment of any kindbeing as fat and in\r\n      every respect in as good order at the expiration of the time as\r\n      when they were first put in in one particular these\r\n      extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary or\r\n      camel of the desert in a bag at the root of the neck they carry\r\n      with them a constant supply of water in some instances upon\r\n      killing them after a full years deprivation of all nourishment\r\n      as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have\r\n      been found in their bags their food is chiefly wild parsley and\r\n      celery with purslain seakelp and prickly pears upon which\r\n      latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully a great quantity of it\r\n      being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the\r\n      animal itself is discovered they are excellent and highly\r\n      nutritious food and have no doubt been the means of preserving\r\n      the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whalefishery\r\n      and other pursuits in the pacific\r\n\r\n      the one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the\r\n      storeroom was not of a large size weighing probably sixtyfive\r\n      or seventy pounds it was a female and in excellent condition\r\n      being exceedingly fat and having more than a quart of limpid and\r\n      sweet water in its bag this was indeed a treasure and falling\r\n      on our knees with one accord we returned fervent thanks to god\r\n      for so seasonable a relief\r\n\r\n      we had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the\r\n      opening as its struggles were fierce and its strength\r\n      prodigious it was upon the point of making its escape from\r\n      peters grasp and slipping back into the water when augustus\r\n      throwing a rope with a slipknot around its throat held it up in\r\n      this manner until i jumped into the hole by the side of peters\r\n      and assisted him in lifting it out\r\n\r\n      the water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug which it\r\n      will be remembered had been brought up before from the cabin\r\n      having done this we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to\r\n      form with the cork a kind of glass holding not quite half a\r\n      gill we then each drank one of these measures full and resolved\r\n      to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should\r\n      hold out\r\n\r\n      during the last two or three days the weather having been dry\r\n      and pleasant the bedding we had obtained from the cabin as well\r\n      as our clothing had become thoroughly dry so that we passed\r\n      this night that of the twentythird in comparative comfort\r\n      enjoying a tranquil repose after having supped plentifully on\r\n      olives and ham with a small allowance of the wine being afraid\r\n      of losing some of our stores overboard during the night in the\r\n      event of a breeze springing up we secured them as well as\r\n      possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass our\r\n      tortoise which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we\r\n      could we threw on its back and otherwise carefully fastened\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      july  this morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and\r\n      strength notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were\r\n      still placed ignorant of our position although certainly at a\r\n      great distance from land without more food than would last us\r\n      for a fortnight even with great care almost entirely without\r\n      water and floating about at the mercy of every wind and wave on\r\n      the merest wreck in the world still the infinitely more terrible\r\n      distresses and dangers from which we had so lately and so\r\n      providentially been delivered caused us to regard what we now\r\n      endured as but little more than an ordinary evilso strictly\r\n      comparative is either good or ill\r\n\r\n      at sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up\r\n      something from the storeroom when a smart shower coming on\r\n      with some lightning we turn our attention to the catching of\r\n      water by means of the sheet we had used before for this purpose\r\n      we had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the\r\n      sheet spread out with one of the forechainplates in the middle\r\n      of it the water thus conducted to the centre was drained\r\n      through into our jug we had nearly filled it in this manner\r\n      when a heavy squall coming on from the northward obliged us to\r\n      desist as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we\r\n      could no longer keep our feet we now went forward and lashing\r\n      ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before\r\n      awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been\r\n      anticipated or would have been imagined possible under the\r\n      circumstances at noon the wind had freshened into a tworeef\r\n      breeze and by night into a stiff gale accompanied with a\r\n      tremendously heavy swell experience having taught us however\r\n      the best method of arranging our lashings we weathered this\r\n      dreary night in tolerable security although thoroughly drenched\r\n      at almost every instant by the sea and in momentary dread of\r\n      being washed off fortunately the weather was so warm as to\r\n      render the water rather grateful than otherwise\r\n\r\n      july  this morning the gale had diminished to a mere tenknot\r\n      breeze and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we\r\n      were able to keep ourselves dry upon the deck to our great\r\n      grief however we found that two jars of our olives as well as\r\n      the whole of our ham had been washed overboard in spite of the\r\n      careful manner in which they had been fastened we determined not\r\n      to kill the tortoise as yet and contented ourselves for the\r\n      present with a breakfast on a few of the olives and a measure of\r\n      water each which latter we mixed half and half with wine\r\n      finding great relief and strength from the mixture without the\r\n      distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port\r\n      the sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at\r\n      getting up provision from the storeroom several articles of no\r\n      importance to us in our present situation floated up through the\r\n      opening during the day and were immediately washed overboard we\r\n      also now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever so that\r\n      we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves on this\r\n      account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day at noon the sun\r\n      appeared to be nearly vertical and we had no doubt that we had\r\n      been driven down by the long succession of northward and\r\n      northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator toward\r\n      evening we saw several sharks and were somewhat alarmed by the\r\n      audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us\r\n      at one time a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the\r\n      water the monster actually swam in upon us floundering for some\r\n      moments just over the companionhatch and striking peters\r\n      violently with his tail a heavy sea at length hurled him\r\n      overboard much to our relief in moderate weather we might have\r\n      easily captured him\r\n\r\n      july  this morning the wind having greatly abated and the\r\n      sea not being very rough we determined to renew our exertions in\r\n      the storeroom after a great deal of hard labor during the whole\r\n      day we found that nothing further was to be expected from this\r\n      quarter the partitions of the room having been stove during the\r\n      night and its contents swept into the hold this discovery as\r\n      may be supposed filled us with despair\r\n\r\n      july  the sea nearly smooth with a light wind and still from\r\n      the northward and westward the sun coming out hotly in the\r\n      afternoon we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes found\r\n      great relief from thirst and much comfort otherwise by bathing\r\n      in the sea in this however we were forced to use great\r\n      caution being afraid of sharks several of which were seen\r\n      swimming around the brig during the day\r\n\r\n      july  good weather still the brig now began to lie along so\r\n      alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up\r\n      prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency\r\n      lashing our tortoise waterjug and two remaining jars of olives\r\n      as far as possible over to the windward placing them outside the\r\n      hull below the mainchains the sea very smooth all day with\r\n      little or no wind\r\n\r\n      july  a continuance of the same weather augustuss wounded\r\n      arm began to evince symptoms of mortification he complained of\r\n      drowsiness and excessive thirst but no acute pain nothing could\r\n      be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of\r\n      the vinegar from the olives and from this no benefit seemed to\r\n      be experienced we did every thing in our power for his comfort\r\n      and trebled his allowance of water\r\n\r\n      july  an excessively hot day with no wind an enormous shark\r\n      kept close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon we made\r\n      several unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose\r\n      augustus much worse and evidently sinking as much from want of\r\n      proper nourishment as from the effect of his wounds he\r\n      constantly prayed to be relieved from his sufferings wishing for\r\n      nothing but death this evening we ate the last of our olives\r\n      and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could not\r\n      swallow it at all without the addition of wine determined to\r\n      kill our tortoise in the morning\r\n\r\n      july  after a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue owing to\r\n      the position of the hulk we set about killing and cutting up our\r\n      tortoise he proved to be much smaller than we had supposed\r\n      although in good conditionthe whole meat about him not\r\n      amounting to more than ten pounds with a view of preserving a\r\n      portion of this as long as possible we cut it into fine pieces\r\n      and filled with them our three remaining olive jars and the\r\n      winebottle all of which had been kept pouring in afterward\r\n      the vinegar from the olives in this manner we put away about\r\n      three pounds of the tortoise intending not to touch it until we\r\n      had consumed the rest we concluded to restrict ourselves to\r\n      about four ounces of the meat per day the whole would thus last\r\n      us thirteen days a brisk shower with severe thunder and\r\n      lightning came on about dusk but lasted so short a time that we\r\n      only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water the whole\r\n      of this by common consent was given to augustus who now\r\n      appeared to be in the last extremity he drank the water from the\r\n      sheet as we caught it we holding it above him as he lay so as to\r\n      let it run into his mouth for we had now nothing left capable\r\n      of holding water unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from\r\n      the carboy or the stale water from the jug either of these\r\n      expedients would have been resorted to had the shower lasted\r\n\r\n      the sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the\r\n      draught his arm was completely black from the wrist to the\r\n      shoulder and his feet were like ice we expected every moment to\r\n      see him breathe his last he was frightfully emaciated so much\r\n      so that although he weighed a hundred and twentyseven pounds\r\n      upon his leaving nantucket he now did not weigh more than forty\r\n      or fifty at the farthest his eyes were sunk far in his head\r\n      being scarcely perceptible and the skin of his cheeks hung so\r\n      loosely as to prevent his masticating any food or even\r\n      swallowing any liquid without great difficulty\r\n\r\n      august  a continuance of the same calm weather with an\r\n      oppressively hot sun suffered exceedingly from thirst the water\r\n      in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin we\r\n      contrived nevertheless to swallow a portion of it by mixing it\r\n      with wine our thirst however was but little abated we found\r\n      more relief by bathing in the sea but could not avail ourselves\r\n      of this expedient except at long intervals on account of the\r\n      continual presence of sharks we now saw clearly that augustus\r\n      could not be saved that he was evidently dying we could do\r\n      nothing to relieve his sufferings which appeared to be great\r\n      about twelve oclock he expired in strong convulsions and\r\n      without having spoken for several hours his death filled us with\r\n      the most gloomy forebodings and had so great an effect upon our\r\n      spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole\r\n      day and never addressed each other except in a whisper it was\r\n      not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and\r\n      throw the body overboard it was then loathsome beyond\r\n      expression and so far decayed that as peters attempted to lift\r\n      it an entire leg came off in his grasp as the mass of\r\n      putrefaction slipped over the vessels side into the water the\r\n      glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly\r\n      discovered to us seven or eight large sharks the clashing of\r\n      whose horrible teeth as their prey was torn to pieces among\r\n      them might have been heard at the distance of a mile we shrunk\r\n      within ourselves in the extremity of horror at the sound\r\n\r\n      august  the same fearfully calm and hot weather the dawn found\r\n      us in a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion\r\n      the water in the jug was now absolutely useless being a thick\r\n      gelatinous mass nothing but frightfullooking worms mingled with\r\n      slime we threw it out and washed the jug well in the sea\r\n      afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our bottles of\r\n      pickled tortoise our thirst could now scarcely be endured and\r\n      we tried in vain to relieve it by wine which seemed only to add\r\n      fuel to the flame and excited us to a high degree of\r\n      intoxication we afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings\r\n      by mixing the wine with seawater but this instantly brought\r\n      about the most violent retchings so that we never again\r\n      attempted it during the whole day we anxiously sought an\r\n      opportunity of bathing but to no purpose for the hulk was now\r\n      entirely besieged on all sides with sharksno doubt the identical\r\n      monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the evening\r\n      before and who were in momentary expectation of another similar\r\n      feast this circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret and\r\n      filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings we\r\n      had experienced indescribable relief in bathing and to have this\r\n      resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could\r\n      bear nor indeed were we altogether free from the apprehension\r\n      of immediate danger for the least slip or false movement would\r\n      have thrown us at once within reach of those voracious fish who\r\n      frequently thrust themselves directly upon us swimming up to\r\n      leeward no shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them\r\n      even when one of the largest was struck with an axe by peters and\r\n      much wounded he persisted in his attempts to push in where we\r\n      were a cloud came up at dusk but to our extreme anguish\r\n      passed over without discharging itself it is quite impossible to\r\n      conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period we passed a\r\n      sleepless night both on this account and through dread of the\r\n      sharks\r\n\r\n      august  no prospect of relief and the brig lying still more\r\n      and more along so that now we could not maintain a footing upon\r\n      deck at all busied ourselves in securing our wine and\r\n      tortoisemeat so that we might not lose them in the event of our\r\n      rolling over got out two stout spikes from the forechains and\r\n      by means of the axe drove them into the hull to windward within\r\n      a couple of feet of the water this not being very far from the\r\n      keel as we were nearly upon our beamends to these spikes we\r\n      now lashed our provisions as being more secure than their former\r\n      position beneath the chains suffered great agony from thirst\r\n      during the whole dayno chance of bathing on account of the\r\n      sharks which never left us for a moment found it impossible to\r\n      sleep\r\n\r\n      august  a little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was\r\n      heeling over and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off\r\n      by the movement at first the roll was slow and gradual and we\r\n      contrived to clamber over to windward very well having taken the\r\n      precaution to leave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven\r\n      in for the provision but we had not calculated sufficiently upon\r\n      the acceleration of the impetus for presently the heel became\r\n      too violent to allow of our keeping pace with it and before\r\n      either of us knew what was to happen we found ourselves hurled\r\n      furiously into the sea and struggling several fathoms beneath\r\n      the surface with the huge hull immediately above us\r\n\r\n      in going under the water i had been obliged to let go my hold\r\n      upon the rope and finding that i was completely beneath the\r\n      vessel and my strength nearly exhausted i scarcely made a\r\n      struggle for life and resigned myself in a few seconds to die\r\n      but here again i was deceived not having taken into\r\n      consideration the natural rebound of the hull to windward the\r\n      whirl of the water upward which the vessel occasioned in rolling\r\n      partially back brought me to the surface still more violently\r\n      than i had been plunged beneath upon coming up i found myself\r\n      about twenty yards from the hulk as near as i could judge she\r\n      was lying keel up rocking furiously from side to side and the\r\n      sea in all directions around was much agitated and full of\r\n      strong whirlpools i could see nothing of peters an oilcask was\r\n      floating within a few feet of me and various other articles from\r\n      the brig were scattered about\r\n\r\n      my principal terror was now on account of the sharks which i\r\n      knew to be in my vicinity in order to deter these if possible\r\n      from approaching me i splashed the water vigorously with both\r\n      hands and feet as i swam towards the hulk creating a body of\r\n      foam i have no doubt that to this expedient simple as it was i\r\n      was indebted for my preservation for the sea all round the brig\r\n      just before her rolling over was so crowded with these monsters\r\n      that i must have been and really was in actual contact with\r\n      some of them during my progress by great good fortune however\r\n      i reached the side of the vessel in safety although so utterly\r\n      weakened by the violent exertion i had used that i should never\r\n      have been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of\r\n      peters who now to my great joy made his appearance having\r\n      scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hull and\r\n      threw me the end of a ropeone of those which had been attached\r\n      to the spikes\r\n\r\n      having barely escaped this danger our attention was now directed\r\n      to the dreadful imminency of anotherthat of absolute starvation\r\n      our whole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of\r\n      all our care in securing it and seeing no longer the remotest\r\n      possibility of obtaining more we gave way both of us to despair\r\n      weeping aloud like children and neither of us attempting to\r\n      offer consolation to the other such weakness can scarcely be\r\n      conceived and to those who have never been similarly situated\r\n      will no doubt appear unnatural but it must be remembered that\r\n      our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of\r\n      privation and terror to which we had been subjected that we\r\n      could not justly be considered at that period in the light of\r\n      rational beings in subsequent perils nearly as great if not\r\n      greater i bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my\r\n      situation and peters it will be seen evinced a stoical\r\n      philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike\r\n      supineness and imbecilitythe mental condition made the\r\n      difference\r\n\r\n      the overturning of the brig even with the consequent loss of the\r\n      wine and turtle would not in fact have rendered our situation\r\n      more deplorable than before except for the disappearance of the\r\n      bedclothes by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch\r\n      rainwater and of the jug in which we had kept it when caught\r\n      for we found the whole bottom from within two or three feet of\r\n      the bends as far as the keel together with the keel itself\r\n      thickly covered with large barnacles which proved to be\r\n      excellent and highly nutritious food thus in two important\r\n      respects the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved to be a\r\n      benefit rather than an injury it had opened to us a supply of\r\n      provisions which we could not have exhausted using it\r\n      moderately in a month and it had greatly contributed to our\r\n      comfort as regards position we being much more at ease and in\r\n      infinitely less danger than before\r\n\r\n      the difficulty however of now obtaining water blinded us to all\r\n      the benefits of the change in our condition that we might be\r\n      ready to avail ourselves as far as possible of any shower which\r\n      might fall we took off our shirts to make use of them as we had\r\n      of the sheetsnot hoping of course to get more in this way\r\n      even under the most favorable circumstances than half a gill at\r\n      a time no signs of a cloud appeared during the day and the\r\n      agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable at night peters\r\n      obtained about an hours disturbed sleep but my intense\r\n      sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single\r\n      moment\r\n\r\n      august  today a gentle breeze springing up carried us through\r\n      a vast quantity of seaweed among which we were so fortunate as\r\n      to find eleven small crabs which afforded us several delicious\r\n      meals their shells being quite soft we ate them entire and\r\n      found that they irritated our thirst far less than the barnacles\r\n      seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed we also ventured to\r\n      bathe and remained in the water for four or five hours during\r\n      which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our thirst\r\n      were greatly refreshed and spent the night somewhat more\r\n      comfortably than before both of us snatching a little sleep\r\n\r\n      august  this day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain\r\n      lasting from about noon until after dark bitterly did we now\r\n      regret the loss of our jug and carboy for in spite of the\r\n      little means we had of catching the water we might have filled\r\n      one if not both of them as it was we contrived to satisfy the\r\n      cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to become saturated\r\n      and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid trickle\r\n      into our mouths in this occupation we passed the entire day\r\n\r\n      august  just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a\r\n      sail to the eastward and evidently coming towards us we\r\n      hailed the glorious sight with a long although feeble shout of\r\n      rapture and began instantly to make every signal in our power\r\n      by flaring the shirts in the air leaping as high as our weak\r\n      condition would permit and even by hallooing with all the\r\n      strength of our lungs although the vessel could not have been\r\n      less than fifteen miles distant however she still continued to\r\n      near our hulk and we felt that if she but held her present\r\n      course she must eventually come so close as to perceive us in\r\n      about an hour after we first discovered her we could clearly see\r\n      the people on her decks she was a long low and rakishlooking\r\n      topsail schooner with a black ball in her foretopsail and had\r\n      apparently a full crew we now became alarmed for we could\r\n      hardly imagine it possible that she did not observe us and were\r\n      apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as we werean\r\n      act of fiendish barbarity which however incredible it may\r\n      appear has been repeatedly perpetuated at sea under\r\n      circumstances very nearly similar and by beings who were\r\n      regarded as belonging to the human species  in this\r\n      instance however by the mercy of god we were destined to be\r\n      most happily deceived for presently we were aware of a sudden\r\n      commotion on the deck of the stranger who immediately afterward\r\n      ran up a british flag and hauling her wind bore up directly\r\n      upon us in half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin\r\n      she proved to be the jane guy of liverpool captain guy bound\r\n      on a sealing and trading voyage to the south seas and pacific\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      the jane guy was a finelooking topsail schooner of a hundred\r\n      and eighty tons burden she was unusually sharp in the bows and\r\n      on a wind in moderate weather the fastest sailer i have ever\r\n      seen her qualities however as a rough seaboat were not so\r\n      good and her draught of water was by far too great for the trade\r\n      to which she was destined for this peculiar service a larger\r\n      vessel and one of a light proportionate draught is\r\n      desirablesay a vessel of from three hundred to three hundred and\r\n      fifty tons she should be barkrigged and in other respects of a\r\n      different construction from the usual south sea ships it is\r\n      absolutely necessary that she should be well armed she should\r\n      have say ten or twelve twelvepound carronades and two or three\r\n      long twelves with brass blunderbusses and watertight\r\n      armchests for each top her anchors and cables should be of far\r\n      greater strength than is required for any other species of trade\r\n      and above all her crew should be numerous and efficientnot\r\n      less for such a vessel as i have described than fifty or sixty\r\n      ablebodied men the jane guy had a crew of thirtyfive all able\r\n      seamen besides the captain and mate but she was not altogether\r\n      as well armed or otherwise equipped as a navigator acquainted\r\n      with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have\r\n      desired\r\n\r\n      captain guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner and of\r\n      considerable experience in the southern traffic to which he had\r\n      devoted a great portion of his life he was deficient however\r\n      in energy and consequently in that spirit of enterprise which\r\n      is here so absolutely requisite he was part owner of the vessel\r\n      in which he sailed and was invested with discretionary powers to\r\n      cruise in the south seas for any cargo which might come most\r\n      readily to hand he had on board as usual in such voyages\r\n      beads lookingglasses tinderworks axes hatchets saws\r\n      adzes planes chisels gouges gimlets files spokeshaves\r\n      rasps hammers nails knives scissors razors needles thread\r\n      crockeryware calico trinkets and other similar articles\r\n\r\n      the schooner sailed from liverpool on the tenth of july crossed\r\n      the tropic of cancer on the twentyfifth in longitude twenty\r\n      degrees west and reached sal one of the cape verd islands on\r\n      the twentyninth where she took in salt and other necessaries\r\n      for the voyage on the third of august she left the cape verds\r\n      and steered southwest stretching over toward the coast of\r\n      brazil so as to cross the equator between the meridians of\r\n      twentyeight and thirty degrees west longitude this is the\r\n      course usually taken by vessels bound from europe to the cape of\r\n      good hope or by that route to the east indies by proceeding\r\n      thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which\r\n      continually prevail on the coast of guinea while in the end it\r\n      is found to be the shortest track as westerly winds are never\r\n      wanting afterward by which to reach the cape it was captain\r\n      guys intention to make his first stoppage at kerguelens landi\r\n      hardly know for what reason on the day we were picked up the\r\n      schooner was off cape st roque in longitude thirtyone degrees\r\n      west so that when found we had drifted probably from north to\r\n      south not less than fiveandtwenty degrees\r\n\r\n      on board the jane guy we were treated with all the kindness our\r\n      distressed situation demanded in about a fortnight during which\r\n      time we continued steering to the southeast with gentle breezes\r\n      and fine weather both peters and myself recovered entirely from\r\n      the effects of our late privation and dreadful sufferings and we\r\n      began to remember what had passed rather as a frightful dream\r\n      from which we had been happily awakened than as events which had\r\n      taken place in sober and naked reality i have since found that\r\n      this species of partial oblivion is usually brought about by\r\n      sudden transition whether from joy to sorrow or from sorrow to\r\n      joythe degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the degree\r\n      of difference in the exchange thus in my own case i now feel\r\n      it impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which i\r\n      endured during the days spent upon the hulk the incidents are\r\n      remembered but not the feelings which the incidents elicited at\r\n      the time of their occurrence i only know that when they did\r\n      occur i then thought human nature could sustain nothing more of\r\n      agony\r\n\r\n      we continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of\r\n      greater moment than the occasional meeting with whalingships\r\n      and more frequently with the black or right whale so called in\r\n      contradistinction to the spermaceti these however were chiefly\r\n      found south of the twentyfifth parallel on the sixteenth of\r\n      september being in the vicinity of the cape of good hope the\r\n      schooner encountered her first gale of any violence since leaving\r\n      liverpool in this neighborhood but more frequently to the south\r\n      and east of the promontory we were to the westward navigators\r\n      have often to contend with storms from the northward which rage\r\n      with great fury they always bring with them a heavy sea and one\r\n      of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping\r\n      round of the wind an occurrence almost certain to take place\r\n      during the greatest force of the gale a perfect hurricane will\r\n      be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast and in\r\n      the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction\r\n      while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a\r\n      violence almost inconceivable a bright spot to the southward is\r\n      the sure forerunner of the change and vessels are thus enabled\r\n      to take the proper precautions\r\n\r\n      it was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a\r\n      white squall and as usual from the northward by eight it had\r\n      increased very much and brought down upon us one of the most\r\n      tremendous seas i had then ever beheld every thing had been made\r\n      as snug as possible but the schooner laboured excessively and\r\n      gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat pitching her\r\n      forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest difficulty\r\n      struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another\r\n      just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the\r\n      lookout made its appearance in the southwest and in an hour\r\n      afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping\r\n      listlessly against the mast in two minutes more in spite of\r\n      every preparation we were hurled on our beamends as if by\r\n      magic and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over\r\n      us as we lay the blow from the southwest however luckily\r\n      proved to be nothing more than a squall and we had the good\r\n      fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar a heavy\r\n      cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this but\r\n      toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as\r\n      before the gale captain guy considered that he had made an\r\n      escape little less than miraculous\r\n\r\n      on the thirteenth of october we came in sight of prince edwards\r\n      island in latitude  degrees  s longitude  degrees \r\n      e two days afterward we found ourselves near possession island\r\n      and presently passed the islands of crozet in latitude \r\n      degrees  s longitude  degrees e on the eighteenth we made\r\n      kerguelens or desolation island in the southern indian ocean\r\n      and came to anchor in christmas harbour having four fathoms of\r\n      water\r\n\r\n      this island or rather group of islands bears southeast from the\r\n      cape of good hope and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred\r\n      leagues it was first discovered in  by the baron de\r\n      kergulen or kerguelen a frenchman who thinking the land to\r\n      form a portion of an extensive southern continent carried home\r\n      information to that effect which produced much excitement at the\r\n      time the government taking the matter up sent the baron back\r\n      in the following year for the purpose of giving his new discovery\r\n      a critical examination when the mistake was discovered in \r\n      captain cook fell in with the same group and gave to the\r\n      principal one the name of desolation island a title which it\r\n      certainly well deserves upon approaching the land however the\r\n      navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise as the sides of\r\n      most of the hills from september to march are clothed with very\r\n      brilliant verdure this deceitful appearance is caused by a small\r\n      plant resembling saxifrage which is abundant growing in large\r\n      patches on a species of crumbling moss besides this plant there\r\n      is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the island if we except some\r\n      coarse rank grass near the harbor some lichen and a shrub which\r\n      bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed and which has\r\n      a bitter and acrid taste\r\n\r\n      the face of the country is hilly although none of the hills can\r\n      be called lofty their tops are perpetually covered with snow\r\n      there are several harbors of which christmas harbour is the most\r\n      convenient it is the first to be met with on the northeast side\r\n      of the island after passing cape francois which forms the\r\n      northern shore and by its peculiar shape serves to distinguish\r\n      the harbour its projecting point terminates in a high rock\r\n      through which is a large hole forming a natural arch the\r\n      entrance is in latitude  degrees  s longitude  degrees\r\n       e passing in here good anchorage may be found under the\r\n      shelter of several small islands which form a sufficient\r\n      protection from all easterly winds proceeding on eastwardly from\r\n      this anchorage you come to wasp bay at the head of the harbour\r\n      this is a small basin completely landlocked into which you can\r\n      go with four fathoms and find anchorage in from ten to three\r\n      hard clay bottom a ship might lie here with her best bower ahead\r\n      all the year round without risk to the westward at the head of\r\n      wasp bay is a small stream of excellent water easily procured\r\n\r\n      some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on\r\n      kerguelens island and sea elephants abound the feathered\r\n      tribes are discovered in great numbers penguins are very plenty\r\n      and of these there are four different kinds the royal penguin\r\n      so called from its size and beautiful plumage is the largest\r\n      the upper part of the body is usually gray sometimes of a lilac\r\n      tint the under portion of the purest white imaginable the head\r\n      is of a glossy and most brilliant black the feet also the chief\r\n      beauty of plumage however consists in two broad stripes of a\r\n      gold color which pass along from the head to the breast the\r\n      bill is long and either pink or bright scarlet these birds walk\r\n      erect with a stately carriage they carry their heads high with\r\n      their wings drooping like two arms and as their tails project\r\n      from their body in a line with the legs the resemblance to a\r\n      human figure is very striking and would be apt to deceive the\r\n      spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the evening the\r\n      royal penguins which we met with on kerguelens land were rather\r\n      larger than a goose the other kinds are the macaroni the\r\n      jackass and the rookery penguin these are much smaller less\r\n      beautiful in plumage and different in other respects\r\n\r\n      besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found among\r\n      which may be mentioned seahens blue peterels teal ducks port\r\n      egmont hens shags cape pigeons the nelly sea swallows terns\r\n      sea gulls mother careys chickens mother careys geese or the\r\n      great peterel and lastly the albatross\r\n\r\n      the great peterel is as large as the common albatross and is\r\n      carnivorous it is frequently called the breakbones or osprey\r\n      peterel they are not at all shy and when properly cooked are\r\n      palatable food in flying they sometimes sail very close to the\r\n      surface of the water with the wings expanded without appearing\r\n      to move them in the least degree or make any exertion with them\r\n      whatever\r\n\r\n      the albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the south sea\r\n      birds it is of the gull species and takes its prey on the wing\r\n      never coming on land except for the purpose of breeding between\r\n      this bird and the penguin the most singular friendship exists\r\n      their nests are constructed with great uniformity upon a plan\r\n      concerted between the two speciesthat of the albatross being\r\n      placed in the centre of a little square formed by the nests of\r\n      four penguins navigators have agreed in calling an assemblage of\r\n      such encampments a rookery these rookeries have been often\r\n      described but as my readers may not all have seen these\r\n      descriptions and as i shall have occasion hereafter to speak of\r\n      the penguin and albatross it will not be amiss to say something\r\n      here of their mode of building and living\r\n\r\n      when the season for incubation arrives the birds assemble in\r\n      vast numbers and for some days appear to be deliberating upon\r\n      the proper course to be pursued at length they proceed to\r\n      action a level piece of ground is selected of suitable extent\r\n      usually comprising three or four acres and situated as near the\r\n      sea as possible being still beyond its reach the spot is chosen\r\n      with reference to its evenness of surface and that is preferred\r\n      which is the least encumbered with stones this matter being\r\n      arranged the birds proceed with one accord and actuated\r\n      apparently by one mind to trace out with mathematical accuracy\r\n      either a square or other parallelogram as may best suit the\r\n      nature of the ground and of just sufficient size to accommodate\r\n      easily all the birds assembled and no morein this particular\r\n      seeming determined upon preventing the access of future\r\n      stragglers who have not participated in the labor of the\r\n      encampment one side of the place thus marked out runs parallel\r\n      with the waters edge and is left open for ingress or egress\r\n\r\n      having defined the limits of the rookery the colony now begin to\r\n      clear it of every species of rubbish picking up stone by stone\r\n      and carrying them outside of the lines and close by them so as\r\n      to form a wall on the three inland sides just within this wall a\r\n      perfectly level and smooth walk is formed from six to eight feet\r\n      wide and extending around the encampmentthus serving the\r\n      purpose of a general promenade\r\n\r\n      the next process is to partition out the whole area into small\r\n      squares exactly equal in size this is done by forming narrow\r\n      paths very smooth and crossing each other at right angles\r\n      throughout the entire extent of the rookery at each intersection\r\n      of these paths the nest of an albatross is constructed and a\r\n      penguins nest in the centre of each squarethus every penguin is\r\n      surrounded by four albatrosses and each albatross by a like\r\n      number of penguins the penguins nest consists of a hole in the\r\n      earth very shallow being only just of sufficient depth to keep\r\n      her single egg from rolling the albatross is somewhat less\r\n      simple in her arrangements erecting a hillock about a foot high\r\n      and two in diameter this is made of earth seaweed and shells\r\n      on its summit she builds her nest\r\n\r\n      the birds take especial care never to leave their nests\r\n      unoccupied for an instant during the period of incubation or\r\n      indeed until the young progeny are sufficiently strong to take\r\n      care of themselves while the male is absent at sea in search of\r\n      food the female remains on duty and it is only upon the return\r\n      of her partner that she ventures abroad the eggs are never left\r\n      uncovered at allwhile one bird leaves the nest the other\r\n      nestling in by its side this precaution is rendered necessary by\r\n      the thieving propensities prevalent in the rookery the\r\n      inhabitants making no scruple to purloin each others eggs at\r\n      every good opportunity\r\n\r\n      although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and\r\n      albatross are the sole population yet in most of them a variety\r\n      of oceanic birds are to be met with enjoying all the privileges\r\n      of citizenship and scattering their nests here and there\r\n      wherever they can find room never interfering however with the\r\n      stations of the larger species the appearance of such\r\n      encampments when seen from a distance is exceedingly singular\r\n      the whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with\r\n      the immense number of the albatross mingled with the smaller\r\n      tribes which are continually hovering over it either going to\r\n      the ocean or returning home at the same time a crowd of penguins\r\n      are to be observed some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys\r\n      and some marching with the military strut so peculiar to them\r\n      around the general promenade ground which encircles the rookery\r\n      in short survey it as we will nothing can be more astonishing\r\n      than the spirit of reflection evinced by these feathered beings\r\n      and nothing surely can be better calculated to elicit reflection\r\n      in every wellregulated human intellect\r\n\r\n      on the morning after our arrival in christmas harbour the chief\r\n      mate mr patterson took the boats and although it was\r\n      somewhat early in the season went in search of seal leaving the\r\n      captain and a young relation of his on a point of barren land to\r\n      the westward they having some business whose nature i could not\r\n      ascertain to transact in the interior of the island captain guy\r\n      took with him a bottle in which was a sealed letter and made\r\n      his way from the point on which he was set on shore toward one of\r\n      the highest peaks in the place it is probable that his design\r\n      was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he\r\n      expected to come after him as soon as we lost sight of him we\r\n      proceeded peters and myself being in the mates boat on our\r\n      cruise around the coast looking for seal in this business we\r\n      were occupied about three weeks examining with great care every\r\n      nook and corner not only of kerguelens land but of the several\r\n      small islands in the vicinity our labours however were not\r\n      crowned with any important success we saw a great many fur seal\r\n      but they were exceedingly shy and with the greatest exertions\r\n      we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all sea\r\n      elephants were abundant especially on the western coast of the\r\n      mainland but of these we killed only twenty and this with great\r\n      difficulty on the smaller islands we discovered a good many of\r\n      the hair seal but did not molest them we returned to the\r\n      schooner on the eleventh where we found captain guy and his\r\n      nephew who gave a very bad account of the interior representing\r\n      it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the\r\n      world they had remained two nights on the island owing to some\r\n      misunderstanding on the part of the second mate in regard to\r\n      the sending a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      on the twelfth we made sail from christmas harbour retracing our\r\n      way to the westward and leaving marions island one of crozets\r\n      group on the larboard we afterward passed prince edwards\r\n      island leaving it also on our left then steering more to the\r\n      northward made in fifteen days the islands of tristan\r\n      dacunha in latitude  degrees  s longitude  degrees  w\r\n\r\n      this group now so well known and which consists of three\r\n      circular islands was first discovered by the portuguese and was\r\n      visited afterward by the dutch in  and by the french in\r\n       the three islands together form a triangle and are distant\r\n      from each other about ten miles there being fine open passages\r\n      between the land in all of them is very high especially in\r\n      tristan dacunha properly so called this is the largest of the\r\n      group being fifteen miles in circumference and so elevated that\r\n      it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or\r\n      ninety miles a part of the land toward the north rises more than\r\n      a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea a tableland at this\r\n      height extends back nearly to the centre of the island and from\r\n      this tableland arises a lofty cone like that of teneriffe the\r\n      lower half of this cone is clothed with trees of good size but\r\n      the upper region is barren rock usually hidden among the clouds\r\n      and covered with snow during the greater part of the year there\r\n      are no shoals or other dangers about the island the shores being\r\n      remarkably bold and the water deep on the northwestern coast is\r\n      a bay with a beach of black sand where a landing with boats can\r\n      be easily effected provided there be a southerly wind plenty of\r\n      excellent water may here be readily procured also cod and other\r\n      fish may be taken with hook and line\r\n\r\n      the next island in point of size and the most westwardly of the\r\n      group is that called the inaccessible its precise situation is\r\n       degrees  s latitude longitude  degrees  w it is\r\n      seven or eight miles in circumference and on all sides presents\r\n      a forbidding and precipitous aspect its top is perfectly flat\r\n      and the whole region is sterile nothing growing upon it except a\r\n      few stunted shrubs\r\n\r\n      nightingale island the smallest and most southerly is in\r\n      latitude  degrees  s longitude  degrees  w off its\r\n      southern extremity is a high ledge of rocky islets a few also of\r\n      a similar appearance are seen to the northeast the ground is\r\n      irregular and sterile and a deep valley partially separates it\r\n\r\n      the shores of these islands abound in the proper season with\r\n      sea lions sea elephants the hair and fur seal together with a\r\n      great variety of oceanic birds whales are also plenty in their\r\n      vicinity owing to the ease with which these various animals were\r\n      here formerly taken the group has been much visited since its\r\n      discovery the dutch and french frequented it at a very early\r\n      period in  captain patten of the ship industry of\r\n      philadelphia made tristan dacunha where he remained seven\r\n      months from august  to april  for the purpose of\r\n      collecting sealskins in this time he gathered no less than five\r\n      thousand six hundred and says that he would have had no\r\n      difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks upon\r\n      his arrival he found no quadrupeds with the exception of a few\r\n      wild goats the island now abounds with all our most valuable\r\n      domestic animals which have been introduced by subsequent\r\n      navigators\r\n\r\n      i believe it was not long after captain pattens visit that\r\n      captain colquhoun of the american brig betsey touched at the\r\n      largest of the islands for the purpose of refreshment he planted\r\n      onions potatoes cabbages and a great many other vegetables an\r\n      abundance of all which is now to be met with\r\n\r\n      in  a captain haywood in the nereus visited tristan he\r\n      found there three americans who were residing upon the island to\r\n      prepare sealskins and oil one of these men was named jonathan\r\n      lambert and he called himself the sovereign of the country he\r\n      had cleared and cultivated about sixty acres of land and turned\r\n      his attention to raising the coffeeplant and sugarcane with\r\n      which he had been furnished by the american minister at rio\r\n      janeiro this settlement however was finally abandoned and in\r\n       the islands were taken possession of by the british\r\n      government who sent a detachment for that purpose from the cape\r\n      of good hope they did not however retain them long but upon\r\n      the evacuation of the country as a british possession two or\r\n      three english families took up their residence there\r\n      independently of the government on the twentyfifth of march\r\n       the berwick captain jeffrey from london to van diemens\r\n      land arrived at the place where they found an englishman of the\r\n      name of glass formerly a corporal in the british artillery he\r\n      claimed to be supreme governor of the islands and had under his\r\n      control twentyone men and three women he gave a very favourable\r\n      account of the salubrity of the climate and of the productiveness\r\n      of the soil the population occupied themselves chiefly in\r\n      collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil with which they traded\r\n      to the cape of good hope glass owning a small schooner at the\r\n      period of our arrival the governor was still a resident but his\r\n      little community had multiplied there being fiftysix persons\r\n      upon tristan besides a smaller settlement of seven on\r\n      nightingale island we had no difficulty in procuring almost\r\n      every kind of refreshment which we requiredsheep hogs\r\n      bullocks rabbits poultry goats fish in great variety and\r\n      vegetables were abundant having come to anchor close in with the\r\n      large island in eighteen fathoms we took all we wanted on board\r\n      very conveniently captain guy also purchased of glass five\r\n      hundred sealskins and some ivory we remained here a week during\r\n      which the prevailing winds were from the northward and westward\r\n      and the weather somewhat hazy on the fifth of november we made\r\n      sail to the southward and westward with the intention of having\r\n      a thorough search for a group of islands called the auroras\r\n      respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has\r\n      existed\r\n\r\n      these islands are said to have been discovered as early as \r\n      by the commander of the ship aurora in  captain manuel de\r\n      oyarvido in the ship princess belonging to the royal philippine\r\n      company sailed as he asserts directly among them in  the\r\n      spanish corvette atrevida went with the determination of\r\n      ascertaining their precise situation and in a paper published\r\n      by the royal hydrographical society of madrid in the year \r\n      the following language is used respecting this expedition the\r\n      corvette atrevida practised in their immediate vicinity from\r\n      the twentyfirst to the twentyseventh of january all the\r\n      necessary observations and measured by chronometers the\r\n      difference of longitude between these islands and the port of\r\n      soledad in the manillas the islands are three they are very\r\n      nearly in the same meridian the centre one is rather low and\r\n      the other two may be seen at nine leagues distance the\r\n      observations made on board the atrevida give the following\r\n      results as the precise situation of each island the most\r\n      northern is in latitude  degrees   s longitude \r\n      degrees   w the middle one in latitude  degrees  \r\n      s longitude  degrees   w and the most southern in\r\n      latitude  degrees   s longitude  degrees   w\r\n\r\n      on the twentyseventh of january  captain james weddel of\r\n      the british navy sailed from staten land also in search of the\r\n      auroras he reports that having made the most diligent search\r\n      and passed not only immediately over the spots indicated by the\r\n      commander of the atrevida but in every direction throughout the\r\n      vicinity of these spots he could discover no indication of land\r\n      these conflicting statements have induced other navigators to\r\n      look out for the islands and strange to say while some have\r\n      sailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie\r\n      without finding them there have been not a few who declare\r\n      positively that they have seen them and even been close in with\r\n      their shores it was captain guys intention to make every\r\n      exertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in\r\n      dispute \r\n\r\n      we kept on our course between the south and west with variable\r\n      weather until the twentieth of the month when we found\r\n      ourselves on the debated ground being in latitude  degrees \r\n      s longitude  degrees  wthat is to say very nearly upon\r\n      the spot indicated as the situation of the most southern of the\r\n      group not perceiving any sign of land we continued to the\r\n      westward of the parallel of fiftythree degrees south as far as\r\n      the meridian of fifty degrees west we then stood to the north as\r\n      far as the parallel of fiftytwo degrees south when we turned to\r\n      the eastward and kept our parallel by double altitudes morning\r\n      and evening and meridian altitudes of the planets and moon\r\n      having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western coast\r\n      of georgia we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude\r\n      from which we set out we then took diagonal courses throughout\r\n      the entire extent of sea circumscribed keeping a lookout\r\n      constantly at the masthead and repeating our examination with\r\n      the greatest care for a period of three weeks during which the\r\n      weather was remarkably pleasant and fair with no haze\r\n      whatsoever of course we were thoroughly satisfied that whatever\r\n      islands might have existed in this vicinity at any former period\r\n      no vestige of them remained at the present day since my return\r\n      home i find that the same ground was traced over with equal\r\n      care in  by captain johnson of the american schooner\r\n      henry and by captain morrell in the american schooner waspin\r\n      both cases with the same result as in our own\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      it had been captain guys original intention after satisfying\r\n      himself about the auroras to proceed through the strait of\r\n      magellan and up along the western coast of patagonia but\r\n      information received at tristan dacunha induced him to steer to\r\n      the southward in the hope of falling in with some small islands\r\n      said to lie about the parallel of  degrees s longitude \r\n      degrees  w in the event of his not discovering these lands\r\n      he designed should the season prove favourable to push on\r\n      toward the pole accordingly on the twelfth of december we made\r\n      sail in that direction on the eighteenth we found ourselves\r\n      about the station indicated by glass and cruised for three days\r\n      in that neighborhood without finding any traces of the islands he\r\n      had mentioned on the twentyfirst the weather being unusually\r\n      pleasant we again made sail to the southward with the\r\n      resolution of penetrating in that course as far as possible\r\n      before entering upon this portion of my narrative it may be as\r\n      well for the information of those readers who have paid little\r\n      attention to the progress of discovery in these regions to give\r\n      some brief account of the very few attempts at reaching the\r\n      southern pole which have hitherto been made\r\n\r\n      that of captain cook was the first of which we have any distinct\r\n      account in  he sailed to the south in the resolution\r\n      accompanied by lieutenant furneaux in the adventure in december\r\n      he found himself as far as the fiftyeighth parallel of south\r\n      latitude and in longitude  degrees  e here he met with\r\n      narrow fields of ice about eight or ten inches thick and\r\n      running northwest and southeast this ice was in large cakes and\r\n      usually it was packed so closely that the vessel had great\r\n      difficulty in forcing a passage at this period captain cook\r\n      supposed from the vast number of birds to be seen and from\r\n      other indications that he was in the near vicinity of land he\r\n      kept on to the southward the weather being exceedingly cold\r\n      until he reached the sixtyfourth parallel in longitude \r\n      degrees  e here he had mild weather with gentle breezes for\r\n      five days the thermometer being at thirtysix in january \r\n      the vessels crossed the antarctic circle but did not succeed in\r\n      penetrating much farther for upon reaching latitude  degrees\r\n       they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of\r\n      ice extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye\r\n      could reach this ice was of every varietyand some large floes\r\n      of it miles in extent formed a compact mass rising eighteen or\r\n      twenty feet above the water it being late in the season and no\r\n      hope entertained of rounding these obstructions captain cook now\r\n      reluctantly turned to the northward\r\n\r\n      in the november following he renewed his search in the antarctic\r\n      in latitude  degrees  he met with a strong current setting\r\n      to the southward in december when the vessels were in latitude\r\n       degrees  longitude  degrees  w the cold was\r\n      excessive with heavy gales and fog here also birds were\r\n      abundant the albatross the penguin and the peterel especially\r\n      in latitude  degrees  some large islands of ice were\r\n      encountered and shortly afterward the clouds to the southward\r\n      were observed to be of a snowy whiteness indicating the vicinity\r\n      of field ice in latitude  degrees  longitude  degrees\r\n       w the navigators were stopped as before by an immense\r\n      frozen expanse which filled the whole area of the southern\r\n      horizon the northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken\r\n      so firmly wedged together as to be utterly impassible and\r\n      extending about a mile to the southward behind it the frozen\r\n      surface was comparatively smooth for some distance until\r\n      terminated in the extreme background by gigantic ranges of ice\r\n      mountains the one towering above the other captain cook\r\n      concluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was\r\n      joined to a continent mr j n reynolds whose great exertions\r\n      and perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot\r\n      a national expedition partly for the purpose of exploring these\r\n      regions thus speaks of the attempt of the resolution we are\r\n      not surprised that captain cook was unable to go beyond \r\n      degrees  but we are astonished that he did attain that point\r\n      on the meridian of  degrees  west longitude palmers land\r\n      lies south of the shetland latitude sixtyfour degrees and\r\n      tends to the southward and westward farther than any navigator\r\n      has yet penetrated cook was standing for this land when his\r\n      progress was arrested by the ice which we apprehend must\r\n      always be the case in that point and so early in the season as\r\n      the sixth of januaryand we should not be surprised if a portion\r\n      of the icy mountains described was attached to the main body of\r\n      palmers land or to some other portions of land lying farther to\r\n      the southward and westward\r\n\r\n      in  captains kreutzenstern and lisiausky were dispatched by\r\n      alexander of russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the\r\n      globe in endeavouring to get south they made no farther than \r\n      degrees  in longitude  degrees  w they here met with\r\n      strong currents setting eastwardly whales were abundant but\r\n      they saw no ice in regard to this voyage mr reynolds observes\r\n      that if kreutzenstern had arrived where he did earlier in the\r\n      season he must have encountered iceit was march when he reached\r\n      the latitude specified the winds prevailing as they do from\r\n      the southward and westward had carried the floes aided by\r\n      currents into that icy region bounded on the north by georgia\r\n      east by sandwich land and the south orkneys and west by the\r\n      south shetland islands\r\n\r\n      in  captain james weddell of the british navy with two\r\n      very small vessels penetrated farther to the south than any\r\n      previous navigator and this too without encountering\r\n      extraordinary difficulties he states that although he was\r\n      frequently hemmed in by ice before reaching the seventysecond\r\n      parallel yet upon attaining it not a particle was to be\r\n      discovered and that upon arriving at the latitude of  degrees\r\n       no fields and only three islands of ice were visible it is\r\n      somewhat remarkable that although vast flocks of birds were\r\n      seen and other usual indications of land and although south of\r\n      the shetlands unknown coasts were observed from the masthead\r\n      tending southwardly weddell discourages the idea of land\r\n      existing in the polar regions of the south\r\n\r\n      on the th of january  captain benjamin morrell of the\r\n      american schooner wasp sailed from kerguelens land with a view\r\n      of penetrating as far south as possible on the first of february\r\n      he found himself in latitude  degrees  s longitude \r\n      degrees  e the following passage is extracted from his\r\n      journal of that date the wind soon freshened to an elevenknot\r\n      breeze and we embraced this opportunity of making to the west\r\n      being however convinced that the farther we went south beyond\r\n      latitude sixtyfour degrees the less ice was to be apprehended\r\n      we steered a little to the southward until we crossed the\r\n      antarctic circle and were in latitude  degrees  e in this\r\n      latitude there was no field ice and very few ice islands in\r\n      sight\r\n\r\n      under the date of march fourteenth i find also this entry the\r\n      sea was now entirely free of field ice and there were not more\r\n      than a dozen ice islands in sight at the same time the\r\n      temperature of the air and water was at least thirteen degrees\r\n      higher more mild than we had ever found it between the\r\n      parallels of sixty and sixtytwo south we were now in latitude\r\n       degrees  s and the temperature of the air was\r\n      fortyseven and that of the water fortyfour in this situation\r\n      i found the variation to be  degrees  easterly per\r\n      azimuth i have several times passed within the antarctic\r\n      circle on different meridians and have uniformly found the\r\n      temperature both of the air and the water to become more and\r\n      more mild the farther i advanced beyond the sixtyfifth degree of\r\n      south latitude and that the variation decreases in the same\r\n      proportion while north of this latitude say between sixty and\r\n      sixtyfive south we frequently had great difficulty in finding a\r\n      passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable\r\n      ice islands some of which were from one to two miles in\r\n      circumference and more than five hundred feet above the surface\r\n      of the water\r\n\r\n      being nearly destitute of fuel and water and without proper\r\n      instruments it being also late in the season captain morrell\r\n      was now obliged to put back without attempting any further\r\n      progress to the westward although an entirely open sea lay\r\n      before him he expresses the opinion that had not these\r\n      overruling considerations obliged him to retreat he could have\r\n      penetrated if not to the pole itself at least to the\r\n      eightyfifth parallel i have given his ideas respecting these\r\n      matters somewhat at length that the reader may have an\r\n      opportunity of seeing how far they were borne out by my own\r\n      subsequent experience\r\n\r\n      in  captain briscoe in the employ of the messieurs enderby\r\n      whaleship owners of london sailed in the brig lively for the\r\n      south seas accompanied by the cutter tula on the twentyeighth\r\n      of february being in latitude  degrees  s longitude \r\n      degrees  e he descried land and clearly discovered through\r\n      the snow the black peaks of a range of mountains running e s\r\n      e he remained in this neighbourhood during the whole of the\r\n      following month but was unable to approach the coast nearer than\r\n      within ten leagues owing to the boisterous state of the weather\r\n      finding it impossible to make further discovery during this\r\n      season he returned northward to winter in van diemens land\r\n\r\n      in the beginning of  he again proceeded southwardly and on\r\n      the fourth of february land was seen to the southeast in latitude\r\n       degrees  longitude  degrees  w this was soon found to\r\n      be an island near the headland of the country he had first\r\n      discovered on the twentyfirst of the month he succeeded in\r\n      landing on the latter and took possession of it in the name of\r\n      william iv calling it adelaides island in honour of the\r\n      english queen these particulars being made known to the royal\r\n      geographical society of london the conclusion was drawn by that\r\n      body that there is a continuous tract of land extending from \r\n      degrees  e to  degrees  w longitude running the\r\n      parallel of from sixtysix to sixtyseven degrees south\r\n      latitude in respect to this conclusion mr reynolds observes\r\n      in the correctness of it we by no means concur nor do the\r\n      discoveries of briscoe warrant any such indifference it was\r\n      within these limits that weddel proceeded south on a meridian to\r\n      the east of georgia sandwich land and the south orkney and\r\n      shetland islands my own experience will be found to testify\r\n      most directly to the falsity of the conclusion arrived at by the\r\n      society\r\n\r\n      these are the principal attempts which have been made at\r\n      penetrating to a high southern latitude and it will now be seen\r\n      that there remained previous to the voyage of the jane nearly\r\n      three hundred degrees of longitude in which the antarctic circle\r\n      had not been crossed at all of course a wide field lay before us\r\n      for discovery and it was with feelings of most intense interest\r\n      that i heard captain guy express his resolution of pushing boldly\r\n      to the southward\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      we kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the\r\n      search for glasss islands without meeting with any ice at all\r\n      on the twentysixth at noon we were in latitude  degrees \r\n      s longitude  degrees  w we now saw several large ice\r\n      islands and a floe of field ice not however of any great\r\n      extent the winds generally blew from the southeast or the\r\n      northeast but were very light whenever we had a westerly wind\r\n      which was seldom it was invariably attended with a rain squall\r\n      every day we had more or less snow the thermometer on the\r\n      twentyseventh stood at thirtyfive\r\n\r\n      january  this day we found ourselves completely hemmed in\r\n      by the ice and our prospects looked cheerless indeed a strong\r\n      gale blew during the whole forenoon from the northeast and\r\n      drove large cakes of the drift against the rudder and counter\r\n      with such violence that we all trembled for the consequences\r\n      toward evening the gale still blowing with fury a large field\r\n      in front separated and we were enabled by carrying a press of\r\n      sail to force a passage through the smaller flakes into some open\r\n      water beyond as we approached this space we took in sail by\r\n      degrees and having at length got clear layto under a single\r\n      reefed foresail\r\n\r\n      january we had now tolerably pleasant weather at noon we\r\n      found ourselves in latitude  degrees  s longitude \r\n      degrees  w having crossed the antarctic circle very little\r\n      ice was to be seen to the southward although large fields of it\r\n      lay behind us this day we rigged some sounding gear using a\r\n      large iron pot capable of holding twenty gallons and a line of\r\n      two hundred fathoms we found the current setting to the north\r\n      about a quarter of a mile per hour the temperature of the air\r\n      was now about thirtythree here we found the variation to be \r\n      degrees  easterly per azimuth\r\n\r\n      january we had still held on to the southward without any very\r\n      great impediments on this morning however being in latitude \r\n      degrees  e longitude  degrees  w we were again brought\r\n      to a stand by an immense expanse of firm ice we saw\r\n      nevertheless much open water to the southward and felt no doubt\r\n      of being able to reach it eventually standing to the eastward\r\n      along the edge of the floe we at length came to a passage of\r\n      about a mile in width through which we warped our way by\r\n      sundown the sea in which we now were was thickly covered with\r\n      ice islands but had no field ice and we pushed on boldly as\r\n      before the cold did not seem to increase although we had snow\r\n      very frequently and now and then hail squalls of great violence\r\n      immense flocks of the albatross flew over the schooner this day\r\n      going from southeast to northwest\r\n\r\n      january the sea still remained pretty well open so that we\r\n      had no difficulty in holding on our course to the westward we\r\n      saw some icebergs of incredible size and in the afternoon passed\r\n      very near one whose summit could not have been less than four\r\n      hundred fathoms from the surface of the ocean its girth was\r\n      probably at the base threequarters of a league and several\r\n      streams of water were running from crevices in its sides we\r\n      remained in sight of this island two days and then only lost it\r\n      in a fog\r\n\r\n      january early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a\r\n      man overboard he was an american named peter vredenburgh a\r\n      native of new york and was one of the most valuable hands on\r\n      board the schooner in going over the bows his foot slipped and\r\n      he fell between two cakes of ice never rising again at noon of\r\n      this day we were in latitude  degrees  longitude  degrees\r\n       w the cold was now excessive and we had hail squalls\r\n      continually from the northward and eastward in this direction\r\n      also we saw several more immense icebergs and the whole horizon\r\n      to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice rising\r\n      in tiers one mass above the other some driftwood floated by\r\n      during the evening and a great quantity of birds flew over\r\n      among which were nellies peterels albatrosses and a large bird\r\n      of a brilliant blue plumage the variation here per azimuth was\r\n      less than it had been previously to our passing the antarctic\r\n      circle\r\n\r\n      january our passage to the south again looked doubtful as\r\n      nothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one\r\n      apparently limitless floe backed by absolute mountains of ragged\r\n      ice one precipice of which arose frowningly above the other we\r\n      stood to the westward until the fourteenth in the hope of\r\n      finding an entrance\r\n\r\n      january this morning we reached the western extremity of the\r\n      field which had impeded us and weathering it came to an open\r\n      sea without a particle of ice upon sounding with two hundred\r\n      fathoms we here found a current setting southwardly at the rate\r\n      of half a mile per hour the temperature of the air was\r\n      fortyseven that of the water thirtyfour we now sailed to the\r\n      southward without meeting any interruption of moment until the\r\n      sixteenth when at noon we were in latitude  degrees \r\n      longitude  degrees w we here again sounded and found a\r\n      current setting still southwardly and at the rate of three\r\n      quarters of a mile per hour the variation per azimuth had\r\n      diminished and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant\r\n      the thermometer being as high as fiftyone at this period not a\r\n      particle of ice was to be discovered all hands on board now felt\r\n      certain of attaining the pole\r\n\r\n      january this day was full of incident innumerable flights of\r\n      birds flew over us from the southward and several were shot from\r\n      the deck one of them a species of pelican proved to be\r\n      excellent eating about midday a small floe of ice was seen from\r\n      the masthead off the larboard bow and upon it there appeared to\r\n      be some large animal as the weather was good and nearly calm\r\n      captain guy ordered out two of the boats to see what it was dirk\r\n      peters and myself accompanied the mate in the larger boat upon\r\n      coming up with the floe we perceived that it was in the\r\n      possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the arctic bear\r\n      but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals being\r\n      well armed we made no scruple of attacking it at once several\r\n      shots were fired in quick succession the most of which took\r\n      effect apparently in the head and body nothing discouraged\r\n      however the monster threw himself from the ice and swam with\r\n      open jaws to the boat in which were peters and myself owing to\r\n      the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of\r\n      the adventure no person was ready immediately with a second\r\n      shot and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his\r\n      vast bulk across our gunwale and seizing one of the men by the\r\n      small of his back before any efficient means were taken to repel\r\n      him in this extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of\r\n      peters saved us from destruction leaping upon the back of the\r\n      huge beast he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck\r\n      reaching the spinal marrow at a blow the brute tumbled into the\r\n      sea lifeless and without a struggle rolling over peters as he\r\n      fell the latter soon recovered himself and a rope being thrown\r\n      him he secured the carcass before entering the boat we then\r\n      returned in triumph to the schooner towing our trophy behind us\r\n      this bear upon admeasurement proved to be full fifteen feet in\r\n      his greatest length his wool was perfectly white and very\r\n      coarse curling tightly the eyes were of a blood red and larger\r\n      than those of the arctic bear the snout also more rounded\r\n      rather resembling the snout of the bulldog the meat was tender\r\n      but excessively rank and fishy although the men devoured it with\r\n      avidity and declared it excellent eating\r\n\r\n      scarcely had we got our prize alongside when the man at the\r\n      masthead gave the joyful shout of land on the starboard bow\r\n      all hands were now upon the alert and a breeze springing up\r\n      very opportunely from the northward and eastward we were soon\r\n      close in with the coast it proved to be a low rocky islet of\r\n      about a league in circumference and altogether destitute of\r\n      vegetation if we except a species of prickly pear in\r\n      approaching it from the northward a singular ledge of rock is\r\n      seen projecting into the sea and bearing a strong resemblance to\r\n      corded bales of cotton around this ledge to the westward is a\r\n      small bay at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient\r\n      landing\r\n\r\n      it did not take us long to explore every portion of the island\r\n      but with one exception we found nothing worthy of our\r\n      observation in the southern extremity we picked up near the\r\n      shore half buried in a pile of loose stones a piece of wood\r\n      which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe there had been\r\n      evidently some attempt at carving upon it and captain guy\r\n      fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise but the\r\n      resemblance did not strike me very forcibly besides this prow\r\n      if such it were we found no other token that any living creature\r\n      had ever been here before around the coast we discovered\r\n      occasional small floes of icebut these were very few the exact\r\n      situation of the islet to which captain guy gave the name of\r\n      bennets islet in honour of his partner in the ownership of the\r\n      schooner is  degrees  s latitude  degrees  w\r\n      longitude\r\n\r\n      we had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees\r\n      farther than any previous navigators and the sea still lay\r\n      perfectly open before us we found too that the variation\r\n      uniformly decreased as we proceeded and what was still more\r\n      surprising that the temperature of the air and latterly of the\r\n      water became milder the weather might even be called pleasant\r\n      and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some\r\n      northern point of the compass the sky was usually clear with\r\n      now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern\r\n      horizonthis however was invariably of brief duration two\r\n      difficulties alone presented themselves to our view we were\r\n      getting short of fuel and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among\r\n      several of the crew these considerations began to impress upon\r\n      captain guy the necessity of returning and he spoke of it\r\n      frequently for my own part confident as i was of soon arriving\r\n      at land of some description upon the course we were pursuing and\r\n      having every reason to believe from present appearances that we\r\n      should not find it the sterile soil met with in the higher arctic\r\n      latitudes i warmly pressed upon him the expediency of\r\n      persevering at least for a few days longer in the direction we\r\n      were now holding so tempting an opportunity of solving the great\r\n      problem in regard to an antarctic continent had never yet been\r\n      afforded to man and i confess that i felt myself bursting with\r\n      indignation at the timid and illtimed suggestions of our\r\n      commander i believe indeed that what i could not refrain from\r\n      saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to push\r\n      on while therefore i cannot but lament the most unfortunate\r\n      and bloody events which immediately arose from my advice i must\r\n      still be allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having\r\n      been instrumental however remotely in opening to the eye of\r\n      science one of the most intensely exciting secrets which has ever\r\n      engrossed its attention\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      january this morning  we continued to the southward with\r\n      the same pleasant weather as before the sea was entirely smooth\r\n      the air tolerably warm and from the northeast the temperature of\r\n      the water fiftythree we now again got our soundinggear in\r\n      order and with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line found the\r\n      current setting toward the pole at the rate of a mile an hour\r\n      this constant tendency to the southward both in the wind and\r\n      current caused some degree of speculation and even of alarm in\r\n      different quarters of the schooner and i saw distinctly that no\r\n      little impression had been made upon the mind of captain guy he\r\n      was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule however and i finally\r\n      succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions the variation\r\n      was now very trivial in the course of the day we saw several\r\n      large whales of the right species and innumerable flights of the\r\n      albatross passed over the vessel we also picked up a bush full\r\n      of red berries like those of the hawthorn and the carcass of a\r\n      singularlooking landanimal it was three feet in length and\r\n      but six inches in height with four very short legs the feet\r\n      armed with long claws of a brilliant scarlet and resembling\r\n      coral in substance the body was covered with a straight silky\r\n      hair perfectly white the tail was peaked like that of a rat\r\n      and about a foot and a half long the head resembled a cats\r\n      with the exception of the earsthese were flopped like the ears\r\n      of a dog the teeth were of the same brilliant scarlet as the\r\n      claws\r\n\r\n      january today being in latitude  degrees  longitude\r\n       degrees  w the sea being of an extraordinarily dark\r\n      colour we again saw land from the masthead and upon a closer\r\n      scrutiny found it to be one of a group of very large islands\r\n      the shore was precipitous and the interior seemed to be well\r\n      wooded a circumstance which occasioned us great joy in about\r\n      four hours from our first discovering the land we came to anchor\r\n      in ten fathoms sandy bottom a league from the coast as a high\r\n      surf with strong ripples here and there rendered a nearer\r\n      approach of doubtful expediency the two largest boats were now\r\n      ordered out and a party well armed among whom were peters and\r\n      myself proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which\r\n      appeared to encircle the island after searching about for some\r\n      time we discovered an inlet which we were entering when we saw\r\n      four large canoes put off from the shore filled with men who\r\n      seemed to be well armed we waited for them to come up and as\r\n      they moved with great rapidity they were soon within hail\r\n      captain guy now held up a white handkerchief on the blade of an\r\n      oar when the strangers made a full stop and commenced a loud\r\n      jabbering all at once intermingled with occasional shouts in\r\n      which we could distinguish the words anamoomoo and lamalama\r\n      they continued this for at least half an hour during which we\r\n      had a good opportunity of observing their appearance\r\n\r\n      in the four canoes which might have been fifty feet long and\r\n      five broad there were a hundred and ten savages in all they\r\n      were about the ordinary stature of europeans but of a more\r\n      muscular and brawny frame their complexion a jet black with\r\n      thick and long woolly hair they were clothed in skins of an\r\n      unknown black animal shaggy and silky and made to fit the body\r\n      with some degree of skill the hair being inside except where\r\n      turned out about the neck wrists and ankles their arms\r\n      consisted principally of clubs of a dark and apparently very\r\n      heavy wood some spears however were observed among them\r\n      headed with flint and a few slings the bottoms of the canoes\r\n      were full of black stones about the size of a large egg\r\n\r\n      when they had concluded their harangue for it was clear they\r\n      intended their jabbering for such one of them who seemed to be\r\n      the chief stood up in the prow of his canoe and made signs for\r\n      us to bring our boats alongside of him this hint we pretended\r\n      not to understand thinking it the wiser plan to maintain if\r\n      possible the interval between us as their number more than\r\n      quadrupled our own finding this to be the case the chief\r\n      ordered the three other canoes to hold back while he advanced\r\n      toward us with his own as soon as he came up with us he leaped\r\n      on board the largest of our boats and seated himself by the side\r\n      of captain guy pointing at the same time to the schooner and\r\n      repeating the word anamoomoo and lamalama we now put back to\r\n      the vessel the four canoes following at a little distance\r\n\r\n      upon getting alongside the chief evinced symptoms of extreme\r\n      surprise and delight clapping his hands slapping his thighs and\r\n      breast and laughing obstreperously his followers behind joined\r\n      in his merriment and for some minutes the din was so excessive\r\n      as to be absolutely deafening quiet being at length restored\r\n      captain guy ordered the boats to be hoisted up as a necessary\r\n      precaution and gave the chief whose name we soon found to be\r\n      toowit to understand that we could admit no more than twenty of\r\n      his men on deck at one time with this arrangement he appeared\r\n      perfectly satisfied and gave some directions to the canoes when\r\n      one of them approached the rest remaining about fifty yards off\r\n      twenty of the savages now got on board and proceeded to ramble\r\n      over every part of the deck and scramble about among the\r\n      rigging making themselves much at home and examining every\r\n      article with great inquisitiveness\r\n\r\n      it was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the\r\n      white racefrom whose complexion indeed they appeared to\r\n      recoil they believed the jane to be a living creature and\r\n      seemed to be afraid of hurting it with the points of their\r\n      spears carefully turning them up our crew were much amused with\r\n      the conduct of toowit in one instance the cook was splitting\r\n      some wood near the galley and by accident struck his axe into\r\n      the deck making a gash of considerable depth the chief\r\n      immediately ran up and pushing the cook on one side rather\r\n      roughly commenced a half whine half howl strongly indicative\r\n      of sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner\r\n      patting and smoothing the gash with his hand and washing it from\r\n      a bucket of seawater which stood by this was a degree of\r\n      ignorance for which we were not prepared and for my part i could\r\n      not help thinking some of it affected\r\n\r\n      when the visitors had satisfied as well as they could their\r\n      curiosity in regard to our upper works they were admitted below\r\n      when their amazement exceeded all bounds their astonishment now\r\n      appeared to be far too deep for words for they roamed about in\r\n      silence broken only by low ejaculations the arms afforded them\r\n      much food for speculation and they were suffered to handle and\r\n      examine them at leisure i do not believe that they had the least\r\n      suspicion of their actual use but rather took them for idols\r\n      seeing the care we had of them and the attention with which we\r\n      watched their movements while handling them at the great guns\r\n      their wonder was redoubled they approached them with every mark\r\n      of the profoundest reverence and awe but forbore to examine them\r\n      minutely there were two large mirrors in the cabin and here was\r\n      the acme of their amazement toowit was the first to approach\r\n      them and he had got in the middle of the cabin with his face to\r\n      one and his back to the other before he fairly perceived them\r\n      upon raising his eyes and seeing his reflected self in the glass\r\n      i thought the savage would go mad but upon turning short round\r\n      to make a retreat and beholding himself a second time in the\r\n      opposite direction i was afraid he would expire upon the spot\r\n      no persuasion could prevail upon him to take another look\r\n      throwing himself upon the floor with his face buried in his\r\n      hands he remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon\r\n      deck\r\n\r\n      the whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner\r\n      twenty at a time toowit being suffered to remain during the\r\n      entire period we saw no disposition to thievery among them nor\r\n      did we miss a single article after their departure throughout\r\n      the whole of their visit they evinced the most friendly manner\r\n      there were however some points in their demeanour which we\r\n      found it impossible to understand for example we could not get\r\n      them to approach several very harmless objectssuch as the\r\n      schooners sails an egg an open book or a pan of flour we\r\n      endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles\r\n      which might be turned to account in the way of traffic but found\r\n      great difficulty in being comprehended we made out\r\n      nevertheless what greatly astonished us that the islands\r\n      abounded in the large tortoise of the gallipagos one of which we\r\n      saw in the canoe of toowit we saw also some biche de mer in the\r\n      hands of one of the savages who was greedily devouring it in its\r\n      natural state these anomaliesfor they were such when considered\r\n      in regard to the latitudeinduced captain guy to wish for a\r\n      thorough investigation of the country in the hope of making a\r\n      profitable speculation in his discovery for my own part anxious\r\n      as i was to know something more of these islands i was still\r\n      more earnestly bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward\r\n      without delay we had now fine weather but there was no telling\r\n      how long it would last and being already in the eightyfourth\r\n      parallel with an open sea before us a current setting strongly\r\n      to the southward and the wind fair i could not listen with any\r\n      patience to a proposition of stopping longer than was absolutely\r\n      necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a\r\n      proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions i represented to the\r\n      captain that we might easily make this group on our return and\r\n      winter here in the event of being blocked up by the ice he at\r\n      length came into my views for in some way hardly known to\r\n      myself i had acquired much influence over him and it was\r\n      finally resolved that even in the event of our finding biche de\r\n      mer we should only stay here a week to recruit and then push on\r\n      to the southward while we might accordingly we made every\r\n      necessary preparation and under the guidance of toowit got\r\n      the jane through the reef in safety coming to anchor about a\r\n      mile from the shore in an excellent bay completely landlocked\r\n      on the southeastern coast of the main island and in ten fathoms\r\n      of water black sandy bottom at the head of this bay there were\r\n      three fine springs we were told of good water and we saw\r\n      abundance of wood in the vicinity the four canoes followed us\r\n      in keeping however at a respectful distance toowit himself\r\n      remained on board and upon our dropping anchor invited us to\r\n      accompany him on shore and visit his village in the interior to\r\n      this captain guy consented and ten savages being left on board\r\n      as hostages a party of us twelve in all got in readiness to\r\n      attend the chief we took care to be well armed yet without\r\n      evincing any distrust the schooner had her guns run out her\r\n      boardingnettings up and every other proper precaution was taken\r\n      to guard against surprise directions were left with the chief\r\n      mate to admit no person on board during our absence and in the\r\n      event of our not appearing in twelve hours to send the cutter\r\n      with a swivel around the island in search of us\r\n\r\n      at every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us\r\n      that we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto\r\n      visited by civilized men we saw nothing with which we had been\r\n      formerly conversant the trees resembled no growth of either the\r\n      torrid the temperate or the northern frigid zones and were\r\n      altogether unlike those of the lower southern latitudes we had\r\n      already traversed the very rocks were novel in their mass their\r\n      color and their stratification and the streams themselves\r\n      utterly incredible as it may appear had so little in common with\r\n      those of other climates that we were scrupulous of tasting them\r\n      and indeed had difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that\r\n      their qualities were purely those of nature at a small brook\r\n      which crossed our path the first we had reached toowit and his\r\n      attendants halted to drink on account of the singular character\r\n      of the water we refused to taste it supposing it to be\r\n      polluted and it was not until some time afterward we came to\r\n      understand that such was the appearance of the streams throughout\r\n      the whole group i am at a loss to give a distinct idea of the\r\n      nature of this liquid and cannot do so without many words\r\n      although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities where common\r\n      water would do so yet never except when falling in a cascade\r\n      had it the customary appearance of limpidity it was\r\n      nevertheless in point of fact as perfectly limpid as any\r\n      limestone water in existence the difference being only in\r\n      appearance at first sight and especially in cases where little\r\n      declivity was found it bore resemblance as regards consistency\r\n      to a thick infusion of gum arabic in common water but this was\r\n      only the least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities it was\r\n      not colourless nor was it of any one uniform colourpresenting\r\n      to the eye as it flowed every possible shade of purple like\r\n      the hues of a changeable silk this variation in shade was\r\n      produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment in\r\n      the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of\r\n      toowit upon collecting a basinful and allowing it to settle\r\n      thoroughly we perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made\r\n      up of a number of distinct veins each of a distinct hue that\r\n      these veins did not commingle and that their cohesion was\r\n      perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves and\r\n      imperfect in regard to neighbouring veins upon passing the blade\r\n      of a knife athwart the veins the water closed over it\r\n      immediately as with us and also in withdrawing it all traces\r\n      of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated if\r\n      however the blade was passed down accurately between the two\r\n      veins a perfect separation was effected which the power of\r\n      cohesion did not immediately rectify the phenomena of this water\r\n      formed the first definite link in that vast chain of apparent\r\n      miracles with which i was destined to be at length encircled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      we were nearly three hours in reaching the village it being more\r\n      than nine miles in the interior and the path lying through a\r\n      rugged country as we passed along the party of toowit the\r\n      whole hundred and ten savages of the canoes was momentarily\r\n      strengthened by smaller detachments of from two to six or seven\r\n      which joined us as if by accident at different turns of the\r\n      road there appeared so much of system in this that i could not\r\n      help feeling distrust and i spoke to captain guy of my\r\n      apprehensions it was now too late however to recede and we\r\n      concluded that our best security lay in evincing a perfect\r\n      confidence in the good faith of toowit we accordingly went on\r\n      keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages and not\r\n      permitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between in\r\n      this way passing through a precipitous ravine we at length\r\n      reached what we were told was the only collection of habitations\r\n      upon the island as we came in sight of them the chief set up a\r\n      shout and frequently repeated the word klockklock which we\r\n      supposed to be the name of the village or perhaps the generic\r\n      name for villages\r\n\r\n      the dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable\r\n      and unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with\r\n      which mankind are acquainted were of no uniform plan some of\r\n      them and these we found belonged to the wampoos or yampoos the\r\n      great men of the land consisted of a tree cut down at about four\r\n      feet from the root with a large black skin thrown over it and\r\n      hanging in loose folds upon the ground under this the savage\r\n      nestled others were formed by means of rough limbs of trees\r\n      with the withered foliage upon them made to recline at an angle\r\n      of fortyfive degrees against a bank of clay heaped up without\r\n      regular form to the height of five or six feet others again\r\n      were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly and covered\r\n      over with similar branches these being removed when the tenant\r\n      was about to enter and pulled on again when he had entered a\r\n      few were built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood the\r\n      upper limbs being partially cut through so as to bend over upon\r\n      the lower thus forming thicker shelter from the weather the\r\n      greater number however consisted of small shallow caverns\r\n      apparently scratched in the face of a precipitous ledge of dark\r\n      stone resembling fullers earth with which three sides of the\r\n      village were bounded at the door of each of these primitive\r\n      caverns was a small rock which the tenant carefully placed\r\n      before the entrance upon leaving his residence for what purpose\r\n      i could not ascertain as the stone itself was never of\r\n      sufficient size to close up more than a third of the opening\r\n\r\n      this village if it were worthy of the name lay in a valley of\r\n      some depth and could only be approached from the southward the\r\n      precipitous ledge of which i have already spoken cutting off all\r\n      access in other directions through the middle of the valley ran\r\n      a brawling stream of the same magicallooking water which has\r\n      been described we saw several strange animals about the\r\n      dwellings all appearing to be thoroughly domesticated the\r\n      largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in the\r\n      structure of the body and snout the tail however was bushy\r\n      and the legs slender as those of the antelope its motion was\r\n      exceedingly awkward and indecisive and we never saw it attempt\r\n      to run we noticed also several animals very similar in\r\n      appearance but of a greater length of body and covered with a\r\n      black wool there were a great variety of tame fowls running\r\n      about and these seemed to constitute the chief food of the\r\n      natives to our astonishment we saw black albatross among these\r\n      birds in a state of entire domestication going to sea\r\n      periodically for food but always returning to the village as a\r\n      home and using the southern shore in the vicinity as a place of\r\n      incubation there they were joined by their friends the pelicans\r\n      as usual but these latter never followed them to the dwellings\r\n      of the savages among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks\r\n      differing very little from the canvassback of our own country\r\n      black gannets and a large bird not unlike the buzzard in\r\n      appearance but not carnivorous of fish there seemed to be a\r\n      great abundance we saw during our visit a quantity of dried\r\n      salmon rock cod blue dolphins mackerel blackfish skate\r\n      conger eels elephantfish mullets soles parrotfish\r\n      leatherjackets gurnards hake flounders paracutas and\r\n      innumerable other varieties we noticed too that most of them\r\n      were similar to the fish about the group of lord auckland\r\n      islands in a latitude as low as fiftyone degrees south the\r\n      gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful we saw but few wild\r\n      animals and none of a large size or of a species with which we\r\n      were familiar one or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed\r\n      our path but the natives paid them little attention and we\r\n      concluded that they were not venomous\r\n\r\n      as we approached the village with toowit and his party a vast\r\n      crowd of the people rushed out to meet us with loud shouts\r\n      among which we could only distinguish the everlasting anamoomoo\r\n      and lamalama we were much surprised at perceiving that with\r\n      one or two exceptions these new comers were entirely naked and\r\n      skins being used only by the men of the canoes all the weapons\r\n      of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the latter\r\n      for there was no appearance of any among the villagers there\r\n      were a great many women and children the former not altogether\r\n      wanting in what might be termed personal beauty they were\r\n      straight tall and well formed with a grace and freedom of\r\n      carriage not to be found in civilized society their lips\r\n      however like those of the men were thick and clumsy so that\r\n      even when laughing the teeth were never disclosed their hair\r\n      was of a finer texture than that of the males among these naked\r\n      villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed\r\n      like the party of toowit in dresses of black skin and armed\r\n      with lances and heavy clubs these appeared to have great\r\n      influence among the rest and were always addressed by the title\r\n      wampoo these too were the tenants of the black skin palaces\r\n      that of toowit was situated in the centre of the village and\r\n      was much larger and somewhat better constructed than others of\r\n      its kind the tree which formed its support was cut off at a\r\n      distance of twelve feet or thereabouts from the root and there\r\n      were several branches left just below the cut these serving to\r\n      extend the covering and in this way prevent its flapping about\r\n      the trunk the covering too which consisted of four very large\r\n      skins fastened together with wooden skewers was secured at the\r\n      bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground the floor\r\n      was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet\r\n\r\n      to this hut we were conducted with great solemnity and as many\r\n      of the natives crowded in after us as possible toowit seated\r\n      himself on the leaves and made signs that we should follow his\r\n      example this we did and presently found ourselves in a\r\n      situation peculiarly uncomfortable if not indeed critical we\r\n      were on the ground twelve in number with the savages as many\r\n      as forty sitting on their hams so closely around us that if any\r\n      disturbance had arisen we should have found it impossible to\r\n      make use of our arms or indeed to have risen to our feet the\r\n      pressure was not only inside the tent but outside where\r\n      probably was every individual on the whole island the crowd\r\n      being prevented from trampling us to death only by the incessant\r\n      exertions and vociferations of toowit our chief security lay\r\n      however in the presence of toowit himself among us and we\r\n      resolved to stick by him closely as the best chance of\r\n      extricating ourselves from the dilemma sacrificing him\r\n      immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design\r\n\r\n      after some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored when\r\n      the chief addressed us in a speech of great length and very\r\n      nearly resembling the one delivered in the canoes with the\r\n      exception that the anamoomoos were now somewhat more\r\n      strenuously insisted upon than the lamalamas we listened in\r\n      profound silence until the conclusion of this harangue when\r\n      captain guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal\r\n      friendship and goodwill concluding what he had to say by a\r\n      present of several strings of blue beads and a knife at the\r\n      former the monarch much to our surprise turned up his nose with\r\n      some expression of contempt but the knife gave him the most\r\n      unlimited satisfaction and he immediately ordered dinner this\r\n      was handed into the tent over the heads of the attendants and\r\n      consisted of the palpitating entrails of a specialis of unknown\r\n      animal probably one of the slimlegged hogs which we had\r\n      observed in our approach to the village seeing us at a loss how\r\n      to proceed he began by way of setting us an example to devour\r\n      yard after yard of the enticing food until we could positively\r\n      stand it no longer and evinced such manifest symptoms of\r\n      rebellion of stomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of\r\n      astonishment only inferior to that brought about by the\r\n      lookingglasses we declined however partaking of the\r\n      delicacies before us and endeavoured to make him understand that\r\n      we had no appetite whatever having just finished a hearty\r\n      dejeuner\r\n\r\n      when the monarch had made an end of his meal we commenced a\r\n      series of crossquestioning in every ingenious manner we could\r\n      devise with a view of discovering what were the chief\r\n      productions of the country and whether any of them might be\r\n      turned to profit at length he seemed to have some idea of our\r\n      meaning and offered to accompany us to a part of coast where he\r\n      assured us the biche de mer pointing to a specimen of that\r\n      animal was to be found in great abundance we were glad of this\r\n      early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd\r\n      and signified our eagerness to proceed we now left the tent\r\n      and accompanied by the whole population of the village followed\r\n      the chief to the southeastern extremity of the island nor far\r\n      from the bay where our vessel lay at anchor we waited here for\r\n      about an hour until the four canoes were brought around by some\r\n      of the savages to our station the whole of our party then\r\n      getting into one of them we were paddled along the edge of the\r\n      reef before mentioned and of another still farther out where we\r\n      saw a far greater quantity of biche de mer than the oldest seamen\r\n      among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower latitudes\r\n      most celebrated for this article of commerce we stayed near\r\n      these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could\r\n      easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary when we\r\n      were taken alongside the schooner and parted with toowit after\r\n      obtaining from him a promise that he would bring us in the\r\n      course of twentyfour hours as many of the canvassback ducks\r\n      and gallipago tortoises as his canoes would hold in the whole of\r\n      this adventure we saw nothing in the demeanour of the natives\r\n      calculated to create suspicion with the single exception of the\r\n      systematic manner in which their party was strengthened during\r\n      our route from the schooner to the village\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      the chief was as good as his word and we were soon plentifully\r\n      supplied with fresh provisions we found the tortoises as fine as\r\n      we had ever seen and the ducks surpassed our best species of\r\n      wild fowl being exceedingly tender juicy and wellflavoured\r\n      besides these the savages brought us upon our making them\r\n      comprehend our wishes a vast quantity of brown celery and scurvy\r\n      grass with a canoeload of fresh fish and some dried the celery\r\n      was a treat indeed and the scurvy grass proved of incalculable\r\n      benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of\r\n      disease in a very short time we had not a single person on the\r\n      sicklist we had also plenty of other kinds of fresh provisions\r\n      among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish resembling\r\n      the mussel in shape but with the taste of an oyster shrimps\r\n      too and prawns were abundant and albatross and other birds\r\n      eggs with dark shells we took in too a plentiful stock of the\r\n      flesh of the hog which i have mentioned before most of the men\r\n      found it a palatable food but i thought it fishy and otherwise\r\n      disagreeable in return for these good things we presented the\r\n      natives with blue beads brass trinkets nails knives and\r\n      pieces of red cloth they being fully delighted in the exchange\r\n      we established a regular market on shore just under the guns of\r\n      the schooner where our barterings were carried on with every\r\n      appearance of good faith and a degree of order which their\r\n      conduct at the village of klockklock had not led us to expect\r\n      from the savages\r\n\r\n      matters went on thus very amicably for several days during which\r\n      parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner and\r\n      parties of our men frequently on shore making long excursions\r\n      into the interior and receiving no molestation whatever finding\r\n      the ease with which the vessel might be loaded with biche de\r\n      mer owing to the friendly disposition of the islanders and the\r\n      readiness with which they would render us assistance in\r\n      collecting it captain guy resolved to enter into negotiations\r\n      with toowit for the erection of suitable houses in which to cure\r\n      the article and for the services of himself and tribe in\r\n      gathering as much as possible while he himself took advantage of\r\n      the fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward upon\r\n      mentioning this project to the chief he seemed very willing to\r\n      enter into an agreement a bargain was accordingly struck\r\n      perfectly satisfactory to both parties by which it was arranged\r\n      that after making the necessary preparations such as laying off\r\n      the proper grounds erecting a portion of the buildings and\r\n      doing some other work in which the whole of our crew would be\r\n      required the schooner should proceed on her route leaving three\r\n      of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of the\r\n      project and instruct the natives in drying the biche de mer\r\n      in regard to terms these were made to depend upon the exertions\r\n      of the savages in our absence they were to receive a stipulated\r\n      quantity of blue beads knives red cloth and so forth for\r\n      every certain number of piculs of the biche de mer which should\r\n      be ready on our return\r\n\r\n      a description of the nature of this important article of\r\n      commerce and the method of preparing it may prove of some\r\n      interest to my readers and i can find no more suitable place\r\n      than this for introducing an account of it the following\r\n      comprehensive notice of the substance is taken from a modern\r\n      history of a voyage to the south seas\r\n\r\n      it is that mollusca from the indian seas which is known to\r\n      commerce by the french name bouche de mer a nice morsel from\r\n      the sea if i am not much mistaken the celebrated cuvier calls\r\n      it gasteropeda pulmonifera it is abundantly gathered in the\r\n      coasts of the pacific islands and gathered especially for the\r\n      chinese market where it commands a great price perhaps as much\r\n      as their muchtalkedof edible birds nests which are properly\r\n      made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a species of\r\n      swallow from the body of these molluscae they have no shell no\r\n      legs nor any prominent part except an absorbing and an\r\n      excretory opposite organs but by their elastic wings like\r\n      caterpillars or worms they creep in shallow waters in which\r\n      when low they can be seen by a kind of swallow the sharp bill\r\n      of which inserted in the soft animal draws a gummy and\r\n      filamentous substance which by drying can be wrought into the\r\n      solid walls of their nest hence the name of gasteropeda\r\n      pulmonifera\r\n\r\n      this mollusca is oblong and of different sizes from three to\r\n      eighteen inches in length and i have seen a few that were not\r\n      less than two feet long they were nearly round a little\r\n      flattish on one side which lies next to the bottom of the sea\r\n      and they are from one to eight inches thick they crawl up into\r\n      shallow water at particular seasons of the year probably for the\r\n      purpose of gendering as we often find them in pairs it is when\r\n      the sun has the most power on the water rendering it tepid that\r\n      they approach the shore and they often go up into places so\r\n      shallow that on the tides receding they are left dry exposed\r\n      to the beat of the sun but they do not bring forth their young\r\n      in shallow water as we never see any of their progeny and\r\n      fullgrown ones are always observed coming in from deep water\r\n      they feed principally on that class of zoophytes which produce\r\n      the coral\r\n\r\n      the biche de mer is generally taken in three or four feet of\r\n      water after which they are brought on shore and split at one\r\n      end with a knife the incision being one inch or more according\r\n      to the size of the mollusca through this opening the entrails\r\n      are forced out by pressure and they are much like those of any\r\n      other small tenant of the deep the article is then washed and\r\n      afterward boiled to a certain degree which must not be too much\r\n      or too little they are then buried in the ground for four hours\r\n      then boiled again for a short time after which they are dried\r\n      either by the fire or the sun those cured by the sun are worth\r\n      the most but where one picul   lbs can be cured that\r\n      way i can cure thirty piculs by the fire when once properly\r\n      cured they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years\r\n      without any risk but they should be examined once in every few\r\n      months say four times a year to see if any dampness is likely\r\n      to affect them\r\n\r\n      the chinese as before stated consider biche de mer a very\r\n      great luxury believing that it wonderfully strengthens and\r\n      nourishes the system and renews the exhausted system of the\r\n      immoderate voluptuary the first quality commands a high price in\r\n      canton being worth ninety dollars a picul the second quality\r\n      seventyfive dollars the third fifty dollars the fourth\r\n      thirty dollars the fifth twenty dollars the sixth twelve\r\n      dollars the seventh eight dollars and the eighth four\r\n      dollars small cargoes however will often bring more in\r\n      manilla singapore and batavia\r\n\r\n      an agreement having been thus entered into we proceeded\r\n      immediately to land everything necessary for preparing the\r\n      buildings and clearing the ground a large flat space near the\r\n      eastern shore of the bay was selected where there was plenty of\r\n      both wood and water and within a convenient distance of the\r\n      principal reefs on which the biche de mer was to be procured\r\n      we now all set to work in good earnest and soon to the great\r\n      astonishment of the savages had felled a sufficient number of\r\n      trees for our purpose getting them quickly in order for the\r\n      framework of the houses which in two or three days were so far\r\n      under way that we could safely trust the rest of the work to the\r\n      three men whom we intended to leave behind these were john\r\n      carson alfred harris and  peterson all natives of london i\r\n      believe who volunteered their services in this respect\r\n\r\n      by the last of the month we had everything in readiness for\r\n      departure we had agreed however to pay a formal visit of\r\n      leavetaking to the village and toowit insisted so\r\n      pertinaciously upon our keeping the promise that we did not think\r\n      it advisable to run the risk of offending him by a final refusal\r\n      i believe that not one of us had at this time the slightest\r\n      suspicion of the good faith of the savages they had uniformly\r\n      behaved with the greatest decorum aiding us with alacrity in our\r\n      work offering us their commodities frequently without price\r\n      and never in any instance pilfering a single article although\r\n      the high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident\r\n      by the extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon\r\n      our making them a present the women especially were most\r\n      obliging in every respect and upon the whole we should have\r\n      been the most suspicious of human beings had we entertained a\r\n      single thought of perfidy on the part of a people who treated us\r\n      so well a very short while sufficed to prove that this apparent\r\n      kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply laid plan\r\n      for our destruction and that the islanders for whom we\r\n      entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem were among the\r\n      most barbarous subtle and bloodthirsty wretches that ever\r\n      contaminated the face of the globe\r\n\r\n      it was on the first of february that we went on shore for the\r\n      purpose of visiting the village although as said before we\r\n      entertained not the slightest suspicion still no proper\r\n      precaution was neglected six men were left in the schooner with\r\n      instructions to permit none of the savages to approach the vessel\r\n      during our absence under any pretence whatever and to remain\r\n      constantly on deck the boardingnettings were up the guns\r\n      doubleshotted with grape and canister and the swivels loaded\r\n      with canisters of musketballs she lay with her anchor apeak\r\n      about a mile from the shore and no canoe could approach her in\r\n      any direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the\r\n      full fire of our swivels immediately\r\n\r\n      the six men being left on board our shoreparty consisted of\r\n      thirtytwo persons in all we were armed to the teeth having\r\n      with us muskets pistols and cutlasses besides each had a long\r\n      kind of seamans knife somewhat resembling the bowie knife now\r\n      so much used throughout our western and southern country a\r\n      hundred of the black skin warriors met us at the landing for the\r\n      purpose of accompanying us on our way we noticed however with\r\n      some surprise that they were now entirely without arms and\r\n      upon questioning toowit in relation to this circumstance he\r\n      merely answered that mattee non we pa pa simeaning that there\r\n      was no need of arms where all were brothers we took this in good\r\n      part and proceeded\r\n\r\n      we had passed the spring and rivulet of which i before spoke and\r\n      were now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain\r\n      of soapstone hills among which the village was situated this\r\n      gorge was very rocky and uneven so much so that it was with no\r\n      little difficulty we scrambled through it on our first visit to\r\n      klockklock the whole length of the ravine might have been a\r\n      mile and a half or probably two miles it wound in every\r\n      possible direction through the hills having apparently formed\r\n      at some remote period the bed of a torrent in no instance\r\n      proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn the\r\n      sides of this dell would have averaged i am sure seventy or\r\n      eighty feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of\r\n      their extent and in some portions they arose to an astonishing\r\n      height overshadowing the pass so completely that but little of\r\n      the light of day could penetrate the general width was about\r\n      forty feet and occasionally it diminished so as not to allow the\r\n      passage of more than five or six persons abreast in short there\r\n      could be no place in the world better adapted for the\r\n      consummation of an ambuscade and it was no more than natural\r\n      that we should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon it\r\n      when i now think of our egregious folly the chief subject of\r\n      astonishment seems to be that we should have ever ventured\r\n      under any circumstances so completely into the power of unknown\r\n      savages as to permit them to march both before and behind us in\r\n      our progress through this ravine yet such was the order we\r\n      blindly took up trusting foolishly to the force of our party\r\n      the unarmed condition of toowit and his men the certain\r\n      efficacy of our firearms whose effect was yet a secret to the\r\n      natives and more than all to the longsustained pretension of\r\n      friendship kept up by these infamous wretches five or six of\r\n      them went on before as if to lead the way ostentatiously\r\n      busying themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from\r\n      the path next came our own party we walked closely together\r\n      taking care only to prevent separation behind followed the main\r\n      body of the savages observing unusual order and decorum\r\n\r\n      dirk peters a man named wilson allen and myself were on the\r\n      right of our companions examining as we went along the\r\n      singular stratification of the precipice which overhung us a\r\n      fissure in the soft rock attracted our attention it was about\r\n      wide enough for one person to enter without squeezing and\r\n      extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet in a\r\n      straight course sloping afterward to the left the height of the\r\n      opening is far as we could see into it from the main gorge was\r\n      perhaps sixty or seventy feet there were one or two stunted\r\n      shrubs growing from the crevices bearing a species of filbert\r\n      which i felt some curiosity to examine and pushed in briskly for\r\n      that purpose gathering five or six of the nuts at a grasp and\r\n      then hastily retreating as i turned i found that peters and\r\n      allen had followed me i desired them to go back as there was\r\n      not room for two persons to pass saying they should have some of\r\n      my nuts they accordingly turned and were scrambling back allen\r\n      being close to the mouth of the fissure when i was suddenly\r\n      aware of a concussion resembling nothing i had ever before\r\n      experienced and which impressed me with a vague conception if\r\n      indeed i then thought of anything that the whole foundations of\r\n      the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder and that the day of\r\n      universal dissolution was at hand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      as soon as i could collect my scattered senses i found myself\r\n      nearly suffocated and grovelling in utter darkness among a\r\n      quantity of loose earth which was also falling upon me heavily\r\n      in every direction threatening to bury me entirely horribly\r\n      alarmed at this idea i struggled to gain my feet and at last\r\n      succeeded i then remained motionless for some moments\r\n      endeavouring to conceive what had happened to me and where i\r\n      was presently i heard a deep groan just at my ear and afterward\r\n      the smothered voice of peters calling to me for aid in the name\r\n      of god i scrambled one or two paces forward when i fell\r\n      directly over the head and shoulders of my companion who i soon\r\n      discovered was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his\r\n      middle and struggling desperately to free himself from the\r\n      pressure i tore the dirt from around him with all the energy i\r\n      could command and at length succeeded in getting him out\r\n\r\n      as soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise\r\n      to be capable of conversing rationally we both came to the\r\n      conclusion that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured\r\n      had by some convulsion of nature or probably from their own\r\n      weight caved in overhead and that we were consequently lost for\r\n      ever being thus entombed alive for a long time we gave up\r\n      supinely to the most intense agony and despair such as cannot be\r\n      adequately imagined by those who have never been in a similar\r\n      position i firmly believed that no incident ever occurring in\r\n      the course of human events is more adapted to inspire the\r\n      supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case like our\r\n      own of living inhumation the blackness of darkness which\r\n      envelops the victim the terrific oppression of lungs the\r\n      stifling fumes from the damp earth unite with the ghastly\r\n      considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of hope\r\n      and that such is the allotted portion of the dead to carry into\r\n      the human heart a degree of appalling awe and horror not to be\r\n      toleratednever to be conceived\r\n\r\n      at length peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain\r\n      precisely the extent of our calamity and grope about our prison\r\n      it being barely possible he observed that some opening might\r\n      yet be left us for escape i caught eagerly at this hope and\r\n      arousing myself to exertion attempted to force my way through\r\n      the loose earth hardly had i advanced a single step before a\r\n      glimmer of light became perceptible enough to convince me that\r\n      at all events we should not immediately perish for want of air\r\n      we now took some degree of heart and encouraged each other to\r\n      hope for the best having scrambled over a bank of rubbish which\r\n      impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light we\r\n      found less difficulty in advancing and also experienced some\r\n      relief from the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented\r\n      us presently we were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects\r\n      around and discovered that we were near the extremity of the\r\n      straight portion of the fissure where it made a turn to the\r\n      left a few struggles more and we reached the bend when to our\r\n      inexpressible joy there appeared a long seam or crack extending\r\n      upward a vast distance generally at an angle of about fortyfive\r\n      degrees although sometimes much more precipitous we could not\r\n      see through the whole extent of this opening but as a good deal\r\n      of light came down it we had little doubt of finding at the top\r\n      of it if we could by any means reach the top a clear passage\r\n      into the open air\r\n\r\n      i now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure\r\n      from the main gorge and that our companion allen was still\r\n      missing we determined at once to retrace our steps and look for\r\n      him after a long search and much danger from the farther caving\r\n      in of the earth above us peters at length cried out to me that\r\n      he had hold of our companions foot and that his whole body was\r\n      deeply buried beneath the rubbish beyond the possibility of\r\n      extricating him i soon found that what he said was too true and\r\n      that of course life had been long extinct with sorrowful\r\n      hearts therefore we left the corpse to its fate and again made\r\n      our way to the bend\r\n\r\n      the breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us and\r\n      after one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up we began once\r\n      more to despair i have before said that the chain of hills\r\n      through which ran the main gorge was composed of a species of\r\n      soft rock resembling soapstone the sides of the cleft we were\r\n      now attempting to ascend were of the same material and so\r\n      excessively slippery being wet that we could get but little\r\n      foothold upon them even in their least precipitous parts in some\r\n      places where the ascent was nearly perpendicular the difficulty\r\n      was of course much aggravated and indeed for some time we\r\n      thought insurmountable we took courage however from despair\r\n      and what by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our\r\n      bowie knives and swinging at the risk of our lives to small\r\n      projecting points of a harder species of slaty rock which now and\r\n      then protruded from the general mass we at length reached a\r\n      natural platform from which was perceptible a patch of blue sky\r\n      at the extremity of a thicklywooded ravine looking back now\r\n      with somewhat more leisure at the passage through which we had\r\n      thus far proceeded we clearly saw from the appearance of its\r\n      sides that it was of late formation and we concluded that the\r\n      concussion whatever it was which had so unexpectedly\r\n      overwhelmed us had also at the same moment laid open this path\r\n      for escape being quite exhausted with exertion and indeed so\r\n      weak that we were scarcely able to stand or articulate peters\r\n      now proposed that we should endeavour to bring our companions to\r\n      the rescue by firing the pistols which still remained in our\r\n      girdlesthe muskets as well as cutlasses had been lost among the\r\n      loose earth at the bottom of the chasm subsequent events proved\r\n      that had we fired we should have sorely repented it but\r\n      luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by this time arisen in\r\n      my mind and we forbore to let the savages know of our\r\n      whereabouts\r\n\r\n      after having reposed for about an hour we pushed on slowly up\r\n      the ravine and had gone no great way before we heard a\r\n      succession of tremendous yells at length we reached what might\r\n      be called the surface of the ground for our path hitherto since\r\n      leaving the platform had lain beneath an archway of high rock\r\n      and foliage at a vast distance overhead with great caution we\r\n      stole to a narrow opening through which we had a clear sight of\r\n      the surrounding country when the whole dreadful secret of the\r\n      concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view\r\n\r\n      the spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the\r\n      highest peak in the range of the soapstone hills the gorge in\r\n      which our party of thirtytwo had entered ran within fifty feet\r\n      to the left of us but for at least one hundred yards the\r\n      channel or bed of this gorge was entirely filled up with the\r\n      chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and stone that\r\n      had been artificially tumbled within it the means by which the\r\n      vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than\r\n      evident for sure traces of the murderous work were yet\r\n      remaining in several spots along the top of the eastern side of\r\n      the gorge we were now on the western might be seen stakes of\r\n      wood driven into the earth in these spots the earth had not\r\n      given way but throughout the whole extent of the face of the\r\n      precipice from which the mass had fallen it was clear from\r\n      marks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the\r\n      rock blaster that stakes similar to those we saw standing had\r\n      been inserted at not more than a yard apart for the length of\r\n      perhaps three hundred feet and ranging at about ten feet back\r\n      from the edge of the gulf strong cords of grape vine were\r\n      attached to the stakes still remaining on the hill and it was\r\n      evident that such cords had also been attached to each of the\r\n      other stakes i have already spoken of the singular\r\n      stratification of these soapstone hills and the description just\r\n      given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected\r\n      our escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of\r\n      its nature this was such that almost every natural convulsion\r\n      would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular layers or\r\n      ridges running parallel with one another and a very moderate\r\n      exertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same\r\n      purpose of this stratification the savages had availed\r\n      themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends there can be no\r\n      doubt that by the continuous line of stakes a partial rupture\r\n      of the soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one\r\n      or two feet when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each\r\n      of the cords these cords being attached to the tops of the\r\n      stakes and extending back from the edge of the cliff a vast\r\n      leverage power was obtained capable of hurling the whole face of\r\n      the hill upon a given signal into the bosom of the abyss below\r\n      the fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of\r\n      uncertainty we alone had escaped from the tempest of that\r\n      overwhelming destruction we were the only living white men upon\r\n      the island\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      our situation as it now appeared was scarcely less dreadful\r\n      than when we had conceived ourselves entombed forever we saw\r\n      before us no prospect but that of being put to death by the\r\n      savages or of dragging out a miserable existence in captivity\r\n      among them we might to be sure conceal ourselves for a time\r\n      from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills and as\r\n      a final resort in the chasm from which we had just issued but\r\n      we must either perish in the long polar winter through cold and\r\n      famine or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain\r\n      relief\r\n\r\n      the whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages\r\n      crowds of whom we now perceived had come over from the islands\r\n      to the southward on flat rafts doubtless with a view of lending\r\n      their aid in the capture and plunder of the jane the vessel\r\n      still lay calmly at anchor in the bay those on board being\r\n      apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting them how we\r\n      longed at that moment to be with them either to aid in effecting\r\n      their escape or to perish with them in attempting a defence we\r\n      saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without\r\n      bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads with but a\r\n      remote hope of benefit to them a pistol fired might suffice to\r\n      apprise them that something wrong had occurred but the report\r\n      could not possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety\r\n      lay in getting out of the harbour forthwithit could not tell\r\n      them that no principles of honour now bound them to remain that\r\n      their companions were no longer among the living upon hearing\r\n      the discharge they could not be more thoroughly prepared to meet\r\n      the foe who were now getting ready to attack than they already\r\n      were and always had been no good therefore and infinite harm\r\n      would result from our firing and after mature deliberation we\r\n      forbore\r\n\r\n      our next thought was to attempt to rush toward the vessel to\r\n      seize one of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay\r\n      and endeavour to force a passage on board but the utter\r\n      impossibility of succeeding in this desperate task soon became\r\n      evident the country as i said before was literally swarming\r\n      with the natives skulking among the bushes and recesses of the\r\n      hills so as not to be observed from the schooner in our\r\n      immediate vicinity especially and blockading the sole path by\r\n      which we could hope to attain the shore at the proper point were\r\n      stationed the whole party of the black skin warriors with\r\n      toowit at their head and apparently only waiting for some\r\n      reenforcement to commence his onset upon the jane the canoes\r\n      too which lay at the head of the bay were manned with savages\r\n      unarmed it is true but who undoubtedly had arms within reach\r\n      we were forced therefore however unwillingly to remain in our\r\n      place of concealment mere spectators of the conflict which\r\n      presently ensued\r\n\r\n      in about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts or\r\n      flatboats without riggers filled with savages and coming round\r\n      the southern bight of the harbor they appeared to have no arms\r\n      except short clubs and stones which lay in the bottom of the\r\n      rafts immediately afterward another detachment still larger\r\n      appeared in an opposite direction and with similar weapons the\r\n      four canoes too were now quickly filled with natives starting\r\n      up from the bushes at the head of the bay and put off swiftly to\r\n      join the other parties thus in less time than i have taken to\r\n      tell it and as if by magic the jane saw herself surrounded by\r\n      an immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing\r\n      her at all hazards\r\n\r\n      that they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an\r\n      instant the six men left in the vessel however resolutely they\r\n      might engage in her defence were altogether unequal to the\r\n      proper management of the guns or in any manner to sustain a\r\n      contest at such odds i could hardly imagine that they would make\r\n      resistance at all but in this was deceived for presently i saw\r\n      them get springs upon the cable and bring the vessels starboard\r\n      broadside to bear upon the canoes which by this time were within\r\n      pistol range the rafts being nearly a quarter of a mile to\r\n      windward owing to some cause unknown but most probably to the\r\n      agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless\r\n      a situation the discharge was an entire failure not a canoe was\r\n      hit or a single savage injured the shots striking short and\r\n      ricocheting over their heads the only effect produced upon them\r\n      was astonishment at the unexpected report and smoke which was so\r\n      excessive that for some moments i almost thought they would\r\n      abandon their design entirely and return to the shore and this\r\n      they would most likely have done had our men followed up their\r\n      broadside by a discharge of small arms in which as the canoes\r\n      were now so near at hand they could not have failed in doing\r\n      some execution sufficient at least to deter this party from a\r\n      farther advance until they could have given the rafts also a\r\n      broadside but in place of this they left the canoe party to\r\n      recover from their panic and by looking about them to see that\r\n      no injury had been sustained while they flew to the larboard to\r\n      get ready for the rafts\r\n\r\n      the discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect the\r\n      star and doubleheaded shot of the large guns cut seven or eight\r\n      of the rafts completely asunder and killed perhaps thirty or\r\n      forty of the savages outright while a hundred of them at least\r\n      were thrown into the water the most of them dreadfully wounded\r\n      the remainder frightened out of their senses commenced at once\r\n      a precipitate retreat not even waiting to pick up their maimed\r\n      companions who were swimming about in every direction screaming\r\n      and yelling for aid this great success however came too late\r\n      for the salvation of our devoted people the canoe party were\r\n      already on board the schooner to the number of more than a\r\n      hundred and fifty the most of them having succeeded in\r\n      scrambling up the chains and over the boardingnetting even\r\n      before the matches had been applied to the larboard guns nothing\r\n      now could withstand their brute rage our men were borne down at\r\n      once overwhelmed trodden under foot and absolutely torn to\r\n      pieces in an instant\r\n\r\n      seeing this the savages on the rafts got the better of their\r\n      fears and came up in shoals to the plunder in five minutes the\r\n      jane was a pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage\r\n      the decks were split open and ripped up the cordage sails and\r\n      everything movable on deck demolished as if by magic while by\r\n      dint of pushing at the stern towing with the canoes and hauling\r\n      at the sides as they swam in thousands around the vessel the\r\n      wretches finally forced her on shore the cable having been\r\n      slipped and delivered her over to the good offices of toowit\r\n      who during the whole of the engagement had maintained like a\r\n      skilful general his post of security and reconnaissance among\r\n      the hills but now that the victory was completed to his\r\n      satisfaction condescended to scamper down with his warriors of\r\n      the black skin and become a partaker in the spoils\r\n\r\n      toowits descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding place and\r\n      reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm at about fifty\r\n      yards from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water at\r\n      which we slaked the burning thirst that now consumed us not far\r\n      from the spring we discovered several of the filbertbushes which\r\n      i mentioned before upon tasting the nuts we found them\r\n      palatable and very nearly resembling in flavour the common\r\n      english filbert we collected our hats full immediately\r\n      deposited them within the ravine and returned for more while we\r\n      were busily employed in gathering these a rustling in the bushes\r\n      alarmed us and we were upon the point of stealing back to our\r\n      covert when a large black bird of the bittern species\r\n      strugglingly and slowly arose above the shrubs i was so much\r\n      startled that i could do nothing but peters had sufficient\r\n      presence of mind to run up to it before it could make its escape\r\n      and seize it by the neck its struggles and screams were\r\n      tremendous and we had thoughts of letting it go lest the noise\r\n      should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in\r\n      the neighbourhood a stab with a bowie knife however at length\r\n      brought it to the ground and we dragged it into the ravine\r\n      congratulating ourselves that at all events we had thus\r\n      obtained a supply of food enough to last us for a week\r\n\r\n      we now went out again to look about us and ventured a\r\n      considerable distance down the southern declivity of the hill\r\n      but met with nothing else which could serve us for food we\r\n      therefore collected a quantity of dry wood and returned seeing\r\n      one or two large parties of the natives on their way to the\r\n      village laden with the plunder of the vessel and who we were\r\n      apprehensive might discover us in passing beneath the hill\r\n\r\n      our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as\r\n      possible and with this object we arranged some brushwood over\r\n      the aperture which i have before spoken of as the one through\r\n      which we saw the patch of blue sky on reaching the platform from\r\n      the interior of the chasm we left only a very small opening just\r\n      wide enough to admit of our seeing the bay without the risk of\r\n      being discovered from below having done this we congratulated\r\n      ourselves upon the security of the position for we were now\r\n      completely excluded from observation as long as we chose to\r\n      remain within the ravine itself and not venture out upon the\r\n      hill we could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been\r\n      within this hollow but indeed when we came to reflect upon the\r\n      probability that the fissure through which we attained it had\r\n      been only just now created by the fall of the cliff opposite and\r\n      that no other way of attaining it could be perceived we were not\r\n      so much rejoiced at the thought of being secure from molestation\r\n      as fearful lest there should be absolutely no means left us for\r\n      descent we resolved to explore the summit of the hill\r\n      thoroughly when a good opportunity should offer in the meantime\r\n      we watched the motions of the savages through our loophole\r\n\r\n      they had already made a complete wreck of the vessel and were\r\n      now preparing to set her on fire in a little while we saw the\r\n      smoke ascending in huge volumes from her main hatchway and\r\n      shortly afterward a dense mass of flame burst up from the\r\n      forecastle the rigging masts and what remained of the sails\r\n      caught immediately and the fire spread rapidly along the decks\r\n      still a great many of the savages retained their stations about\r\n      her hammering with large stones axes and cannon balls at the\r\n      bolts and other iron and copper work on the beach and in canoes\r\n      and rafts there were not less altogether in the immediate\r\n      vicinity of the schooner than ten thousand natives besides the\r\n      shoals of them who laden with booty were making their way\r\n      inland and over to the neighbouring islands we now anticipated a\r\n      catastrophe and were not disappointed first of all there came a\r\n      smart shock which we felt as distinctly where we were as if we\r\n      had been slightly galvanized but unattended with any visible\r\n      signs of an explosion the savages were evidently startled and\r\n      paused for an instant from their labours and yellings they were\r\n      upon the point of recommencing when suddenly a mass of smoke\r\n      puffed up from the decks resembling a black and heavy\r\n      thundercloudthen as if from its bowels arose a tall stream of\r\n      vivid fire to the height apparently of a quarter of a milethen\r\n      there came a sudden circular expansion of the flamethen the\r\n      whole atmosphere was magically crowded in a single instant with\r\n      a wild chaos of wood and metal and human limbsand lastly\r\n      came the concussion in its fullest fury which hurled us\r\n      impetuously from our feet while the hills echoed and reechoed\r\n      the tumult and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the\r\n      ruins tumbled headlong in every direction around us\r\n\r\n      the havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation\r\n      and they had now indeed reaped the full and perfect fruits of\r\n      their treachery perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion\r\n      while at least an equal number were desperately mangled the\r\n      whole surface of the bay was literally strewn with the struggling\r\n      and drowning wretches and on shore matters were even worse they\r\n      seemed utterly appalled by the suddenness and completeness of\r\n      their discomfiture and made no efforts at assisting one another\r\n      at length we observed a total change in their demeanour from\r\n      absolute stupor they appeared to be all at once aroused to the\r\n      highest pitch of excitement and rushed wildly about going to\r\n      and from a certain point on the beach with the strangest\r\n      expressions of mingled horror rage and intense curiosity\r\n      depicted on their countenances and shouting at the top of their\r\n      voices tekelili tekelili\r\n\r\n      presently we saw a large body go off into the hills whence they\r\n      returned in a short time carrying stakes of wood these they\r\n      brought to the station where the crowd was the thickest which\r\n      now separated so as to afford us a view of the object of all this\r\n      excitement we perceived something white lying upon the ground\r\n      but could not immediately make out what it was at length we saw\r\n      that it was the carcass of the strange animal with the scarlet\r\n      teeth and claws which the schooner had picked up at sea on the\r\n      eighteenth of january captain guy had had the body preserved for\r\n      the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to england i\r\n      remember he had given some directions about it just before our\r\n      making the island and it had been brought into the cabin and\r\n      stowed away in one of the lockers it had now been thrown on\r\n      shore by the explosion but why it had occasioned so much concern\r\n      among the savages was more than we could comprehend although\r\n      they crowded around the carcass at a little distance none of\r\n      them seemed willing to approach it closely byandby the men\r\n      with the stakes drove them in a circle around it and no sooner\r\n      was this arrangement completed than the whole of the vast\r\n      assemblage rushed into the interior of the island with loud\r\n      screams of tekelili tekelili\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      during the six or seven days immediately following we remained in\r\n      our hidingplace upon the hill going out only occasionally and\r\n      then with the greatest precaution for water and filberts we had\r\n      made a kind of penthouse on the platform furnishing it with a\r\n      bed of dry leaves and placing in it three large flat stones\r\n      which served us for both fireplace and table we kindled a fire\r\n      without difficulty by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together\r\n      the one soft the other hard the bird we had taken in such good\r\n      season proved excellent eating although somewhat tough it was\r\n      not an oceanic fowl but a species of bittern with jet black and\r\n      grizzly plumage and diminutive wings in proportion to its bulk\r\n      we afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the\r\n      ravine apparently seeking for the one we had captured but as\r\n      they never alighted we had no opportunity of catching them\r\n\r\n      as long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our\r\n      situation but it was now entirely consumed and it became\r\n      absolutely necessary that we should look out for provision the\r\n      filberts would not satisfy the cravings of hunger afflicting us\r\n      too with severe gripings of the bowels and if freely indulged\r\n      in with violent headache we had seen several large tortoises\r\n      near the seashore to the eastward of the hill and perceived they\r\n      might be easily taken if we could get at them without the\r\n      observation of the natives it was resolved therefore to make\r\n      an attempt at descending\r\n\r\n      we commenced by going down the southern declivity which seemed\r\n      to offer the fewest difficulties but had not proceeded a hundred\r\n      yards before as we had anticipated from appearances on the\r\n      hilltop our progress was entirely arrested by a branch of the\r\n      gorge in which our companions had perished we now passed along\r\n      the edge of this for about a quarter of a mile when we were\r\n      again stopped by a precipice of immense depth and not being\r\n      able to make our way along the brink of it we were forced to\r\n      retrace our steps by the main ravine\r\n\r\n      we now pushed over to the eastward but with precisely similar\r\n      fortune after an hours scramble at the risk of breaking our\r\n      necks we discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit\r\n      of black granite with fine dust at the bottom and whence the\r\n      only egress was by the rugged path in which we had come down\r\n      toiling again up this path we now tried the northern edge of the\r\n      hill here we were obliged to use the greatest possible caution\r\n      in our maneuvers as the least indiscretion would expose us to\r\n      the full view of the savages in the village we crawled along\r\n      therefore on our hands and knees and occasionally were even\r\n      forced to throw ourselves at full length dragging our bodies\r\n      along by means of the shrubbery in this careful manner we had\r\n      proceeded but a little way when we arrived at a chasm far deeper\r\n      than any we had yet seen and leading directly into the main\r\n      gorge thus our fears were fully confirmed and we found\r\n      ourselves cut off entirely from access to the world below\r\n      thoroughly exhausted by our exertions we made the best of our\r\n      way back to the platform and throwing ourselves upon the bed of\r\n      leaves slept sweetly and soundly for some hours\r\n\r\n      for several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in\r\n      exploring every part of the summit of the hill in order to\r\n      inform ourselves of its actual resources we found that it would\r\n      afford us no food with the exception of the unwholesome\r\n      filberts and a rank species of scurvy grass which grew in a\r\n      little patch of not more than four rods square and would be soon\r\n      exhausted on the fifteenth of february as near as i can\r\n      remember there was not a blade of this left and the nuts were\r\n      growing scarce our situation therefore could hardly be more\r\n      lamentable  on the sixteenth we again went round the walls\r\n      of our prison in hope of finding some avenue of escape but to\r\n      no purpose we also descended the chasm in which we had been\r\n      overwhelmed with the faint expectation of discovering through\r\n      this channel some opening to the main ravine here too we were\r\n      disappointed although we found and brought up with us a musket\r\n\r\n      on the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining\r\n      more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made\r\n      our way in the first search we remembered that one of the\r\n      fissures in the sides of this pit had been but partially looked\r\n      into and we were anxious to explore it although with no\r\n      expectation of discovering here any opening\r\n\r\n      we found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow\r\n      as before and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some\r\n      attention it was indeed one of the most singularlooking\r\n      places imaginable and we could scarcely bring ourselves to\r\n      believe it altogether the work of nature the pit from its\r\n      eastern to its western extremity was about five hundred yards in\r\n      length when all its windings were threaded the distance from\r\n      east to west in a straight line not being more i should suppose\r\n      having no means of accurate examination than forty or fifty\r\n      yards upon first descending into the chasm that is to say for\r\n      a hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill the sides of\r\n      the abyss bore little resemblance to each other and apparently\r\n      had at no time been connected the one surface being of the\r\n      soapstone and the other of marl granulated with some metallic\r\n      matter the average breadth or interval between the two cliffs\r\n      was probably here sixty feet but there seemed to be no\r\n      regularity of formation passing down however beyond the limit\r\n      spoken of the interval rapidly contracted and the sides began\r\n      to run parallel although for some distance farther they were\r\n      still dissimilar in their material and form of surface upon\r\n      arriving within fifty feet of the bottom a perfect regularity\r\n      commenced the sides were now entirely uniform in substance in\r\n      colour and in lateral direction the material being a very black\r\n      and shining granite and the distance between the two sides at\r\n      all points facing each other exactly twenty yards the precise\r\n      formation of the chasm will be best understood by means of a\r\n      delineation taken upon the spot for i had luckily with me a\r\n      pocketbook and pencil which i preserved with great care through\r\n      a long series of subsequent adventure and to which i am indebted\r\n      for memoranda of many subjects which would otherwise have been\r\n      crowded from my remembrance\r\n\r\n      this figure no figures in text gives the general outlines of\r\n      the chasm without the minor cavities in the sides of which\r\n      there were several each cavity having a corresponding\r\n      protuberance opposite the bottom of the gulf was covered to the\r\n      depth of three or four inches with a powder almost impalpable\r\n      beneath which we found a continuation of the black granite to\r\n      the right at the lower extremity will be noticed the appearance\r\n      of a small opening this is the fissure alluded to above and to\r\n      examine which more minutely than before was the object of our\r\n      second visit we now pushed into it with vigor cutting away a\r\n      quantity of brambles which impeded us and removing a vast heap\r\n      of sharp flints somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape we were\r\n      encouraged to persevere however by perceiving some little light\r\n      proceeding from the farther end we at length squeezed our way\r\n      for about thirty feet and found that the aperture was a low and\r\n      regularly formed arch having a bottom of the same impalpable\r\n      powder as that in the main chasm a strong light now broke upon\r\n      us and turning a short bend we found ourselves in another\r\n      lofty chamber similar to the one we had left in every respect\r\n      but longitudinal form its general figure is here given\r\n\r\n      the total length of this chasm commencing at the opening a and\r\n      proceeding round the curve b to the extremity d is five\r\n      hundred and fifty yards at c we discovered a small aperture\r\n      similar to the one through which we had issued from the other\r\n      chasm and this was choked up in the same manner with brambles\r\n      and a quantity of the white arrowhead flints we forced our way\r\n      through it finding it about forty feet long and emerged into a\r\n      third chasm this too was precisely like the first except in\r\n      its longitudinal shape which was thus\r\n\r\n      we found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and\r\n      twenty yards at the point a was an opening about six feet\r\n      wide and extending fifteen feet into the rock where it\r\n      terminated in a bed of marl there being no other chasm beyond\r\n      as we had expected we were about leaving this fissure into\r\n      which very little light was admitted when peters called my\r\n      attention to a range of singularlooking indentures in the\r\n      surface of the marl forming the termination of the culdesac\r\n      with a very slight exertion of the imagination the left or most\r\n      northern of these indentures might have been taken for the\r\n      intentional although rude representation of a human figure\r\n      standing erect with outstretched arm the rest of them bore also\r\n      some little resemblance to alphabetical characters and peters\r\n      was willing at all events to adopt the idle opinion that they\r\n      were really such i convinced him of his error finally by\r\n      directing his attention to the floor of the fissure where among\r\n      the powder we picked up piece by piece several large flakes of\r\n      the marl which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion\r\n      from the surface where the indentures were found and which had\r\n      projecting points exactly fitting the indentures thus proving\r\n      them to have been the work of nature\r\n\r\n      after satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded\r\n      us no means of escape from our prison we made our way back\r\n      dejected and dispirited to the summit of the hill nothing worth\r\n      mentioning occurred during the next twentyfour hours except\r\n      that in examining the ground to the eastward of the third chasm\r\n      we found two triangular holes of great depth and also with black\r\n      granite sides into these holes we did not think it worth while\r\n      to attempt descending as they had the appearance of mere natural\r\n      wells without outlet they were each about twenty yards in\r\n      circumference and their shape as well as relative position in\r\n      regard to the third chasm is shown in figure  image\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      on the twentieth of the month finding it altogether impossible\r\n      to subsist any longer upon the filberts the use of which\r\n      occasioned us the most excruciating torment we resolved to make\r\n      a desperate attempt at descending the southern declivity of the\r\n      hill the face of the precipice was here of the softest species\r\n      of soapstone although nearly perpendicular throughout its whole\r\n      extent a depth of a hundred and fifty feet at the least and in\r\n      many places even overarching after a long search we discovered a\r\n      narrow ledge about twenty feet below the brink of the gulf upon\r\n      this peters contrived to leap with what assistance i could\r\n      render him by means of our pockethandkerchiefs tied together\r\n      with somewhat more difficulty i also got down and we then saw\r\n      the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in\r\n      which we had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried\r\n      by the fall of the hillthat is by cutting steps in the face of\r\n      the soapstone with our knives the extreme hazard of the attempt\r\n      can scarcely be conceived but as there was no other resource\r\n      we determined to undertake it\r\n\r\n      upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbertbushes and\r\n      to one of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs\r\n      the other end being tied round peters waist i lowered him down\r\n      over the edge of the precipice until the handkerchiefs were\r\n      stretched tight he now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the\r\n      soapstone as far in as eight or ten inches sloping away the\r\n      rock above to the height of a foot or thereabout so as to allow\r\n      of his driving with the butt of a pistol a tolerably strong peg\r\n      into the levelled surface i then drew him up for about four\r\n      feet when he made a hole similar to the one below driving in a\r\n      peg as before and having thus a restingplace for both feet and\r\n      hands i now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush throwing\r\n      him the end which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole\r\n      letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower\r\n      than he had yet been that is to the full extent of the\r\n      handkerchiefs here he dug another hole and drove another peg\r\n      he then drew himself up so as to rest his feet in the hole just\r\n      cut taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above it\r\n      was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost\r\n      peg with the view of fastening them to the second and here he\r\n      found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so\r\n      great a distance apart however after one or two unsuccessful\r\n      and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot having to hold on\r\n      with his left hand while he labored to undo the fastening with\r\n      his right he at length cut the string leaving six inches of it\r\n      affixed to the peg tying the handkerchiefs now to the second\r\n      peg he descended to a station below the third taking care not\r\n      to go too far down by these means means which i should never\r\n      have conceived of myself and for which we were indebted\r\n      altogether to peters ingenuity and resolution my companion\r\n      finally succeeded with the occasional aid of projections in the\r\n      cliff in reaching the bottom without accident\r\n\r\n      it was some time before i could summon sufficient resolution to\r\n      follow him but i did at length attempt it peters had taken off\r\n      his shirt before descending and this with my own formed the\r\n      rope necessary for the adventure after throwing down the musket\r\n      found in the chasm i fastened this rope to the bushes and let\r\n      myself down rapidly striving by the vigor of my movements to\r\n      banish the trepidation which i could overcome in no other manner\r\n      this answered sufficiently well for the first four or five steps\r\n      but presently i found my imagination growing terribly excited by\r\n      thoughts of the vast depths yet to be descended and the\r\n      precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my\r\n      only support it was in vain i endeavored to banish these\r\n      reflections and to keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat\r\n      surface of the cliff before me the more earnestly i struggled\r\n      not to thinkthe more intensely vivid became my conceptions\r\n      and the more horribly distinct at length arrived that crisis of\r\n      fancy so fearful in all similar cases the crisis in which we\r\n      began to anticipate the feelings with which we shallfallto\r\n      picture to ourselves the sickness and dizziness and the last\r\n      struggle and the half swoon and the final bitterness of the\r\n      rushing and headlong descent and now i found these fancies\r\n      creating their own realities and all imagined horrors crowding\r\n      upon me in fact i felt my knees strike violently together while\r\n      my fingers were gradually but certainly relaxing their grasp\r\n      there was a ringing in my ears and i said this is my knell of\r\n      death and now i was consumed with the irrepressible desire of\r\n      looking below i could not i would not confine my glances to\r\n      the cliff and with a wild indefinable emotion half of horror\r\n      half of a relieved oppression i threw my vision far down into\r\n      the abyss for one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon\r\n      their hold while with the movement the faintest possible idea\r\n      of ultimate escape wandered like a shadow through my mindin\r\n      the next my whole soul was pervaded with a longing to fall a\r\n      desire a yearning a passion utterly uncontrollable i let go at\r\n      once my grasp upon the peg and turning half round from the\r\n      precipice remained tottering for an instant against its naked\r\n      face but now there came a spinning of the brain a\r\n      shrillsounding and phantom voice screamed within my ears a\r\n      dusky fiendish and filmy figure stood immediately beneath me\r\n      and sighing i sunk down with a bursting heart and plunged\r\n      within its arms\r\n\r\n      i had swooned and peters had caught me as i fell he had\r\n      observed my proceedings from his station at the bottom of the\r\n      cliff and perceiving my imminent danger had endeavored to\r\n      inspire me with courage by every suggestion he could devise\r\n      although my confusion of mind had been so great as to prevent my\r\n      hearing what he said or being conscious that he had even spoken\r\n      to me at all at length seeing me totter he hastened to ascend\r\n      to my rescue and arrived just in time for my preservation had i\r\n      fallen with my full weight the rope of linen would inevitably\r\n      have snapped and i should have been precipitated into the abyss\r\n      as it was he contrived to let me down gently so as to remain\r\n      suspended without danger until animation returned this was in\r\n      about fifteen minutes on recovery my trepidation had entirely\r\n      vanished i felt a new being and with some little further aid\r\n      from my companion reached the bottom also in safety\r\n\r\n      we now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved\r\n      the tomb of our friends and to the southward of the spot where\r\n      the hill had fallen the place was one of singular wildness and\r\n      its aspect brought to my mind the descriptions given by\r\n      travellers of those dreary regions marking the site of degraded\r\n      babylon not to speak of the ruins of the disrupted cliff which\r\n      formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the northward the\r\n      surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn with\r\n      huge tumuli apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of\r\n      art although in detail no semblance of art could be detected\r\n      scoria were abundant and large shapeless blocks of the black\r\n      granite intermingled with others of marl  and both\r\n      granulated with metal of vegetation there were no traces\r\n      whatsoever throughout the whole of the desolate area within\r\n      sight several immense scorpions were seen and various reptiles\r\n      not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes as food was our\r\n      most immediate object we resolved to make our way to the\r\n      seacoast distant not more than half a mile with a view of\r\n      catching turtle several of which we had observed from our place\r\n      of concealment on the hill we had proceeded some hundred yards\r\n      threading our route cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli\r\n      when upon turning a corner five savages sprung upon us from a\r\n      small cavern felling peters to the ground with a blow from a\r\n      club as he fell the whole party rushed upon him to secure their\r\n      victim leaving me time to recover from my astonishment i still\r\n      had the musket but the barrel had received so much injury in\r\n      being thrown from the precipice that i cast it aside as useless\r\n      preferring to trust my pistols which had been carefully\r\n      preserved in order with these i advanced upon the assailants\r\n      firing one after the other in quick succession two savages fell\r\n      and one who was in the act of thrusting a spear into peters\r\n      sprung to his feet without accomplishing his purpose my\r\n      companion being thus released we had no further difficulty he\r\n      had his pistols also but prudently declined using them\r\n      confiding in his great personal strength which far exceeded that\r\n      of any person i have ever known seizing a club from one of the\r\n      savages who had fallen he dashed out the brains of the three who\r\n      remained killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the\r\n      weapon and leaving us completely masters of the field\r\n\r\n      so rapidly had these events passed that we could scarcely\r\n      believe in their reality and were standing over the bodies of\r\n      the dead in a species of stupid contemplation when we were\r\n      brought to recollection by the sound of shouts in the distance\r\n      it was clear that the savages had been alarmed by the firing and\r\n      that we had little chance of avoiding discovery to regain the\r\n      cliff it would be necessary to proceed in the direction of the\r\n      shouts and even should we succeed in arriving at its base we\r\n      should never be able to ascend it without being seen our\r\n      situation was one of the greatest peril and we were hesitating\r\n      in which path to commence a flight when one of the savages\r\n      whomi had shot and supposed dead sprang briskly to his feet\r\n      and attempted to make his escape we overtook himhowever\r\n      before he had advanced many paces and were about to put him to\r\n      death when peters suggested that we might derive some benefit\r\n      from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt to escape we\r\n      therefore dragged him with us making him understand that we\r\n      would shoot him if he offered resistance in a few minutes he was\r\n      perfectly submissive and ran by our sides as we pushed in among\r\n      the rocks making for the seashore\r\n\r\n      so far the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing\r\n      hid the sea except at intervals from our sight and when we\r\n      first had it fairly in view it was perhaps two hundred yards\r\n      distant as we emerged into the open beach we saw to our great\r\n      dismay an immense crowd of the natives pouring from the village\r\n      and from all visible quarters of the island making toward us\r\n      with gesticulations of extreme fury and howling like wild\r\n      beasts we were upon the point of turning upon our steps and\r\n      trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the rougher\r\n      ground when i discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from\r\n      behind a large rock which ran out into the water toward these we\r\n      now ran with all speed and reaching them found them unguarded\r\n      and without any other freight than three of the large gallipago\r\n      turtles and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers we\r\n      instantly took possession of one of them and forcing our\r\n      captive on board pushed out to sea with all the strength we\r\n      could command\r\n\r\n      we had not made however more than fifty yards from the shore\r\n      before we became sufficiently calm to perceive the great\r\n      oversight of which we had been guilty in leaving the other canoe\r\n      in the power of the savages who by this time were not more\r\n      than twice as far from the beach as ourselves and were rapidly\r\n      advancing to the pursuit no time was now to be lost our hope\r\n      was at best a forlorn one but we had none other it was very\r\n      doubtful whether with the utmost exertion we could get back in\r\n      time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe but\r\n      yet there was a chance that we could we might save ourselves if\r\n      we succeeded while not to make the attempt was to resign\r\n      ourselves to inevitable butchery\r\n\r\n      the canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike and in\r\n      place of turning it around we merely changed our position in\r\n      paddling as soon as the savages perceived this they redoubled\r\n      their yells as well as their speed and approached with\r\n      inconceivable rapidity we pulled however with all the energy\r\n      of desperation and arrived at the contested point before more\r\n      than one of the natives had attained it this man paid dearly for\r\n      his superior agility peters shooting him through the head with a\r\n      pistol as he approached the shore the foremost among the rest of\r\n      his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces distant as we\r\n      seized upon the canoe we at first endeavored to pull her into\r\n      the deep water beyond the reach of the savages but finding her\r\n      too firmly aground and there being no time to spare peters\r\n      with one or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket\r\n      succeeded in dashing out a large portion of the bow and of one\r\n      side we then pushed off two of the natives by this time had got\r\n      hold of our boat obstinately refusing to let go until we were\r\n      forced to despatch them with our knives we were now clear off\r\n      and making great way out to sea the main body of the savages\r\n      upon reaching the broken canoe set up the most tremendous yell\r\n      of rage and disappointment conceivable in truth from everything\r\n      i could see of these wretches they appeared to be the most\r\n      wicked hypocritical vindictive bloodthirsty and altogether\r\n      fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe it is clear we\r\n      should have had no mercy had we fallen into their hands they\r\n      made a mad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe but\r\n      finding it useless again vented their rage in a series of\r\n      hideous vociferations and rushed up into the hills\r\n\r\n      we were thus relieved from immediate danger but our situation\r\n      was still sufficiently gloomy we knew that four canoes of the\r\n      kind we had were at one time in the possession of the savages\r\n      and were not aware of the fact afterward ascertained from our\r\n      captive that two of these had been blown to pieces in the\r\n      explosion of the jane guywe calculated therefore upon being\r\n      yet pursued as soon as our enemies could get round to the bay\r\n      distant about three miles where the boats were usually laid up\r\n      fearing this we made every exertion to leave the island behind\r\n      us and went rapidly through the water forcing the prisoner to\r\n      take a paddle in about half an hour when we had gained probably\r\n      five or six miles to the southward a large fleet of the\r\n      flatbottomed canoes or rafts were seen to emerge from the bay\r\n      evidently with the design of pursuit presently they put back\r\n      despairing to overtake us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter \r\n\r\n\r\n      we now found ourselves in the wide and desolate antarctic ocean\r\n      in a latitude exceeding eightyfour degrees in a frail canoe\r\n      and with no provision but the three turtles the long polar\r\n      winter too could not be considered as far distant and it\r\n      became necessary that we should deliberate well upon the course\r\n      to be pursued there were six or seven islands in sight belonging\r\n      to the same group and distant from each other about five or six\r\n      leagues but upon neither of these had we any intention to\r\n      venture in coming from the northward in the jane guy we had\r\n      been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of\r\n      icethis however little it maybe in accordance with the\r\n      generally received notions respecting the antarctic was a\r\n      factexperience would not permit us to deny to attempt\r\n      therefore getting back would be follyespecially at so late a\r\n      period of the season only one course seemed to be left open for\r\n      hope we resolved to steer boldly to the southward where there\r\n      was at least a probability of discovering other lands and more\r\n      than a probability of finding a still milder climate\r\n\r\n      so far we had found the antarctic like the arctic ocean\r\n      peculiarly free from violent storms or immoderately rough water\r\n      but our canoe was at best of frail structure although large\r\n      and we set busily to work with a view of rendering her as safe as\r\n      the limited means in our possession would admit the body of the\r\n      boat was of no better material than barkthe bark of a tree\r\n      unknown the ribs were of a tough osier well adapted to the\r\n      purpose for which it was used we had fifty feet room from stem\r\n      to stern from four to six in breadth and in depth throughout\r\n      four feet and a halfthe boats thus differing vastly in shape\r\n      from those of any other inhabitants of the southern ocean with\r\n      whom civilized nations are acquainted we never did believe them\r\n      the workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them and\r\n      some days after this period discovered by questioning our\r\n      captive that they were in fact made by the natives of a group to\r\n      the southwest of the country where we found them having fallen\r\n      accidentally into the hands of our barbarians what we could do\r\n      for the security of our boat was very little indeed several wide\r\n      rents were discovered near both ends and these we contrived to\r\n      patch up with pieces of woollen jacket with the help of the\r\n      superfluous paddles of which there were a great many we erected\r\n      a kind of framework about the bow so as to break the force of\r\n      any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter we also\r\n      set up two paddleblades for masts placing them opposite each\r\n      other one by each gunwale thus saving the necessity of a yard\r\n      to these masts we attached a sail made of our shirtsdoing this\r\n      with some difficulty as here we could get no assistance from our\r\n      prisoner whatever although he had been willing enough to labor\r\n      in all the other operations the sight of the linen seemed to\r\n      affect him in a very singular manner he could not be prevailed\r\n      upon to touch it or go near it shuddering when we attempted to\r\n      force him and shrieking out tekelili\r\n\r\n      having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of\r\n      the canoe we now set sail to the southsoutheast for the\r\n      present with the view of weathering the most southerly of the\r\n      group in sight this being done we turned the bow full to the\r\n      southward the weather could by no means be considered\r\n      disagreeable we had a prevailing and very gentle wind from the\r\n      northward a smooth sea and continual daylight no ice whatever\r\n      was to be seen nor did i ever see one particle of this after\r\n      leaving the parallel of bennets isletindeed the temperature\r\n      of the water was here far too warm for its existence in any\r\n      quantity having killed the largest of our tortoises and\r\n      obtained from him not only food but a copious supply of water we\r\n      continued on our course without any incident of moment for\r\n      perhaps seven or eight days during which period we must have\r\n      proceeded a vast distance to the southward as the wind blew\r\n      constantly with us and a very strong current set continually in\r\n      the direction we were pursuing\r\n\r\n      march st many unusual phenomena nowindicated that we\r\n      were entering upon a region of novelty and wonder a high range\r\n      of light gray vapor appeared constantly in the southern horizon\r\n      flaring up occasionally in lofty streaks now darting from east\r\n      to west now from west to east and again presenting a level and\r\n      uniform summitin short having all the wild variations of the\r\n      aurora borealis the average height of this vapor as apparent\r\n      from our station was about twentyfive degrees the temperature\r\n      of the sea seemed to be increasing momentarily and there was a\r\n      very perceptible alteration in its color\r\n\r\n      march dtoday by repeated questioning of our captive we\r\n      came to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island\r\n      of the massacre its inhabitants and customsbut with these how\r\n      can i now detain the reader i may say however that we learned\r\n      there were eight islands in the groupthat they were governed by\r\n      a common king named tsalemonor psalemounwho resided in one\r\n      of the smallest of the islands that the black skins forming the\r\n      dress of the warriors came from an animal of huge size to be\r\n      found only in a valley near the court of the kingthat the\r\n      inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats than the\r\n      flatbottomed rafts the four canoes being all of the kind in\r\n      their possession and these having been obtained by mere\r\n      accident from some large island in the southwestthat his own\r\n      name was nunuthat he had no knowledge of bennets isletand\r\n      that the appellation of the island he had left was tsalal the\r\n      commencement of the words tsalemonand tsalal was given with a\r\n      prolonged hissing sound which we found it impossible to imitate\r\n      even after repeated endeavors and which was precisely the same\r\n      with the note of the black bittern we had eaten up on the summit\r\n      of the hill\r\n\r\n      march dthe heat of the water was now truly remarkable and\r\n      in color was undergoing a rapid change being no longer\r\n      transparent but of a milky consistency and hue in our immediate\r\n      vicinity it was usually smooth never so rough as to endanger the\r\n      canoebut we were frequently surprised at perceiving to our\r\n      right and left at different distances sudden and extensive\r\n      agitations of the surface these we at length noticed were\r\n      always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapor to the\r\n      southward\r\n\r\n      march thtoday with the view of widening our sail the\r\n      breeze from the northward dying away perceptibly i took from my\r\n      coatpocket a white handkerchief nunu was seated at my elbow\r\n      and the linen accidentally flaring in his face he became\r\n      violently affected with convulsions these were succeeded by\r\n      drowsiness and stupor and low murmurings of tekelili\r\n      tekelili\r\n\r\n      marchththe wind had entirely ceased but it was evident that\r\n      we were still hurrying on to the southward under the influence\r\n      of a powerful current and nowindeed it would seem reasonable\r\n      that we should experience some alarm at the turn events were\r\n      takingbut we felt none the countenance of peters indicated\r\n      nothing of this nature although it wore at times an expression i\r\n      could not fathom the polar winter appeared to be coming onbut\r\n      coming without its terrors i felt a numbness of body and minda\r\n      dreaminess of sensation but this was all\r\n\r\n      march ththe gray vapor had now arisen many more degrees\r\n      above the horizon and was gradually losing its grayness of tint\r\n      the heat of the water was extreme even unpleasant to the touch\r\n      and its milky hue was more evident than ever today a violent\r\n      agitation of the water occurred very close to the canoe it was\r\n      attended as usual with a wild flaring up of the vapor at its\r\n      summit and a momentary division at its base a fine white\r\n      powder resembling ashesbut certainly not suchfell over the\r\n      canoe and over a large surface of the water as the flickering\r\n      died away among the vapor and the commotion subsided in the sea\r\n      nunu now threw himself on his face in the bottom of the boat\r\n      and no persuasions could induce him to arise\r\n\r\n      march ththis day we questioned nunu concerning the motives\r\n      of his countrymen in destroying our companions but he appeared\r\n      to be too utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational\r\n      reply he still obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat and\r\n      upon reiterating the questions as to the motive made use only of\r\n      idiotic gesticulations such as raising with his forefinger the\r\n      upper lip and displaying the teeth which lay beneath it these\r\n      were black we had never before seen the teeth of an inhabitant\r\n      of tsalal\r\n\r\n      march thtoday there floated by us one of the white animals\r\n      whose appearance upon the beach at tsalal had occasioned so wild\r\n      a commotion among the savages i would have picked it up but\r\n      there came over me a sudden listlessness and i forbore the heat\r\n      of the water still increased and the hand could no longer be\r\n      endured within it peters spoke little and i knew not what to\r\n      think of his apathy nunu breathed and no more\r\n\r\n      march ththe whole ashy material fell now continually around\r\n      us and in vast quantities the range of vapor to the southward\r\n      had arisen prodigiously in the horizon and began to assume more\r\n      distinctness of form i can liken it to nothing but a limitless\r\n      cataract rolling silently into the sea from some immense and\r\n      fardistant rampart in the heaven the gigantic curtain ranged\r\n      along the whole extent of the southern horizon it emitted no\r\n      sound\r\n\r\n      march sta sullen darkness now hovered above usbut from out\r\n      the milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose and stole\r\n      up along the bulwarks of the boat we were nearly overwhelmed by\r\n      the white ashy shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe\r\n      but melted into the water as it fell the summit of the cataract\r\n      was utterly lost in the dimness and the distance yet we were\r\n      evidently approaching it with a hideous velocity at intervals\r\n      there were visible in it wide yawning but momentary rents and\r\n      from out these rents within which was a chaos of flitting and\r\n      indistinct images there came rushing and mighty but soundless\r\n      winds tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course\r\n\r\n      march dthe darkness had materially increased relieved only\r\n      by the glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain\r\n      before us many gigantic and pallidly white birds flew\r\n      continuously now from beyond the veil and their scream was the\r\n      eternal tekelilias they retreated from our vision hereupon\r\n      nunu stirred in the bottom of the boat but upon touching him we\r\n      found his spirit departed and now we rushed into the embraces of\r\n      the cataract where a chasm threw itself open to receive us but\r\n      there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure very far\r\n      larger in its proportions than any dweller among men and the hue\r\n      of the skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the\r\n      snow\r\n\r\n      note\r\n\r\n      the circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing\r\n      death of mr pym are already well known to the public through the\r\n      medium of the daily press it is feared that the few remaining\r\n      chapters which were to have completed his narrative and which\r\n      were retained by him while the above were in type for the\r\n      purpose of revision have been irrecoverably lost through the\r\n      accident by which he perished himself this however may prove\r\n      not to be the case and the papers if ultimately found will be\r\n      given to the public\r\n\r\n      no means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency the\r\n      gentleman whose name is mentioned in the preface and who from\r\n      the statement there made might be supposed able to fill the\r\n      vacuum has declined the taskthis for satisfactory reasons\r\n      connected with the general inaccuracy of the details afforded\r\n      him and his disbelief in the entire truth of the latter portions\r\n      of the narration peters from whom some information might be\r\n      expected is still alive and a resident of illinois but cannot\r\n      be met with at present he may hereafter be found and will no\r\n      doubt afford material for a conclusion of mr pyms account\r\n\r\n      the loss of two or three final chapters for there were but two\r\n      or three is the more deeply to be regretted as it can not be\r\n      doubted they contained matter relative to the pole itself or at\r\n      least to regions in its very near proximity and as too the\r\n      statements of the author in relation to these regions may shortly\r\n      be verified or contradicted by means of the governmental\r\n      expedition now preparing for the southern ocean\r\n\r\n      on one point in the narrative some remarks may well be offered\r\n      and it would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if\r\n      what he may here observe should have a tendency to throw credit\r\n      in any degree upon the very singular pages now published we\r\n      allude to the chasms found in the island of tsalal and to the\r\n      whole of the figures upon pages  of the printed\r\n      editioned\r\n\r\n      note no figures were included with this text\r\n\r\n      mr pym has given the figures of the chasms without comment and\r\n      speaks decidedly of the indenturesfound at the extremity of the\r\n      most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful\r\n      resemblance to alphabetical characters and in short as being\r\n      positively not such this assertion is made in a manner so\r\n      simple and sustained by a species of demonstration so conclusive\r\n      viz the fitting of the projections of the fragments found\r\n      among the dust into the indentures upon the wall that we are\r\n      forced to believe the writer in earnest and no reasonable reader\r\n      should suppose otherwise but as the facts in relation to all the\r\n      figures are most singular especially when taken in connection\r\n      with statements made in the body of the narrative it may be as\r\n      well to say a word or two concerning them allthis too the more\r\n      especially as the facts in question have beyond doubt escaped\r\n      the attention of mr poe\r\n\r\n      figure  then figure  figure  and figure  when conjoined\r\n      with one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves\r\n      presented and when deprived of the small lateral branches or\r\n      arches which it will be remembered served only as a means of\r\n      communication between the main chambers and were of totally\r\n      distinct character constitute an ethiopian verbal rootthe root\r\n      to be shadywhence all the inflections of shadow or darkness\r\n\r\n      in regard to the left or most northwardly of the indentures in\r\n      figure  it is more than probable that the opinion of peters was\r\n      correct and that the hieroglyphical appearance was really the\r\n      work of art and intended as the representation of a human form\r\n      the delineation is before the reader and he may or may not\r\n      perceive the resemblance suggested but the rest of the\r\n      indentures afford strong confirmation of peters idea the upper\r\n      range is evidently the arabic verbal root to be white whence\r\n      all the inflections of brilliancy and whiteness the lower range\r\n      is not so immediately perspicuous the characters are somewhat\r\n      broken and disjointed nevertheless it can not be doubted that\r\n      in their perfect state they formed the full egyptian word the\r\n      region of the south it should be observed that these\r\n      interpretations confirm the opinion of peters in regard to the\r\n      most northwardly of the figures the arm is outstretched toward\r\n      the south\r\n\r\n      conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and\r\n      exciting conjecture they should be regarded perhaps in\r\n      connection with some of the most faintly detailed incidents of\r\n      the narrative although in no visible manner is this chain of\r\n      connection complete tekelili was the cry of the affrighted\r\n      natives of tsalal upon discovering the carcase of the\r\n      whiteanimal picked up at sea this

idolatrous egypt presided as they tell over\r\n      marriages illomened then most surely she presided over mine\r\n\r\n      there is one dear topic however on which my memory fails me\r\n      not it is the person of ligeia in stature she was tall\r\n      somewhat slender and in her latter days even emaciated i\r\n      would in vain attempt to portray the majesty the quiet ease of\r\n      her demeanor or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of\r\n      her footfall she came and departed as a shadow i was never made\r\n      aware of her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music\r\n      of her low sweet voice as she placed her marble hand upon my\r\n      shoulder in beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her it was\r\n      the radiance of an opiumdreaman airy and spiritlifting vision\r\n      more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered about the\r\n      slumbering souls of the daughters of delos yet her features were\r\n      not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to\r\n      worship in the classical labors of the heathen there is no\r\n      exquisite beauty says bacon lord verulam speaking truly of\r\n      all the forms and genera of beauty without some strangeness in\r\n      the proportion yet although i saw that the features of ligeia\r\n      were not of a classic regularityalthough i perceived that her\r\n      loveliness was indeed exquisite and felt that there was much\r\n      of strangeness pervading it yet i have tried in vain to detect\r\n      the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of the\r\n      strange i examined the contour of the lofty and pale\r\n      foreheadit was faultlesshow cold indeed that word when applied\r\n      to a majesty so divinethe skin rivalling the purest ivory the\r\n      commanding extent and repose the gentle prominence of the\r\n      regions above the temples and then the ravenblack the glossy\r\n      the luxuriant and naturallycurling tresses setting forth the\r\n      full force of the homeric epithet hyacinthine i looked at the\r\n      delicate outlines of the noseand nowhere but in the graceful\r\n      medallions of the hebrews had i beheld a similar perfection\r\n      there were the same luxurious smoothness of surface the same\r\n      scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline the same\r\n      harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit i regarded\r\n      the sweet mouth here was indeed the triumph of all things\r\n      heavenlythe magnificent turn of the short upper lipthe soft\r\n      voluptuous slumber of the underthe dimples which sported and\r\n      the color which spokethe teeth glancing back with a brilliancy\r\n      almost startling every ray of the holy light which fell upon\r\n      them in her serene and placid yet most exultingly radiant of all\r\n      smiles i scrutinized the formation of the chinand here too i\r\n      found the gentleness of breadth the softness and the majesty\r\n      the fullness and the spirituality of the greekthe contour which\r\n      the god apollo revealed but in a dream to cleomenes the son of\r\n      the athenian and then i peered into the large eyes of ligeia\r\n\r\n      for eyes we have no models in the remotely antique it might have\r\n      been too that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to\r\n      which lord verulam alludes they were i must believe far larger\r\n      than the ordinary eyes of our own race they were even fuller\r\n      than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley\r\n      of nourjahad yet it was only at intervalsin moments of intense\r\n      excitementthat this peculiarity became more than slightly\r\n      noticeable in ligeia and at such moments was her beautyin my\r\n      heated fancy thus it appeared perhapsthe beauty of beings either\r\n      above or apart from the earththe beauty of the fabulous houri of\r\n      the turk the hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black\r\n      and far over them hung jetty lashes of great length the brows\r\n      slightly irregular in outline had the same tint the\r\n      strangeness however which i found in the eyes was of a\r\n      nature distinct from the formation or the color or the\r\n      brilliancy of the features and must after all be referred to\r\n      the expression ah word of no meaning behind whose vast\r\n      latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of\r\n      the spiritual the expression of the eyes of ligeia how for long\r\n      hours have i pondered upon it how have i through the whole of a\r\n      midsummer night struggled to fathom it what was itthat\r\n      something more profound than the well of democrituswhich lay far\r\n      within the pupils of my beloved what was it i was possessed\r\n      with a passion to discover those eyes those large those\r\n      shining those divine orbs they became to me twin stars of leda\r\n      and i to them devoutest of astrologers\r\n\r\n      there is no point among the many incomprehensible anomalies of\r\n      the science of mind more thrillingly exciting than the\r\n      factnever i believe noticed in the schoolsthat in our\r\n      endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten we often\r\n      find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance without being\r\n      able in the end to remember and thus how frequently in my\r\n      intense scrutiny of ligeias eyes have i felt approaching the\r\n      full knowledge of their expressionfelt it approachingyet not\r\n      quite be mineand so at length entirely depart and strange oh\r\n      strangest mystery of all i found in the commonest objects of\r\n      the universe a circle of analogies to that expression i mean to\r\n      say that subsequently to the period when ligeias beauty passed\r\n      into my spirit there dwelling as in a shrine i derived from\r\n      many existences in the material world a sentiment such as i felt\r\n      always aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs yet not\r\n      the more could i define that sentiment or analyze or even\r\n      steadily view it i recognized it let me repeat sometimes in\r\n      the survey of a rapidlygrowing vinein the contemplation of a\r\n      moth a butterfly a chrysalis a stream of running water i have\r\n      felt it in the oceanin the falling of a meteor i have felt it\r\n      in the glances of unusually aged people and there are one or two\r\n      stars in heavenone especially a star of the sixth magnitude\r\n      double and changeable to be found near the large star in lyra\r\n      in a telescopic scrutiny of which i have been made aware of the\r\n      feeling i have been filled with it by certain sounds from\r\n      stringed instruments and not unfrequently by passages from\r\n      books among innumerable other instances i well remember\r\n      something in a volume of joseph glanvill which perhaps merely\r\n      from its quaintnesswho shall say never failed to inspire me\r\n      with the sentiment and the will therein lieth which dieth not\r\n      who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor for god is\r\n      but a great will pervading all things by nature of its\r\n      intentness man doth not yield him to the angels nor unto death\r\n      utterly save only through the weakness of his feeble will\r\n\r\n      length of years and subsequent reflection have enabled me to\r\n      trace indeed some remote connection between this passage in the\r\n      english moralist and a portion of the character of ligeia an\r\n      intensity in thought action or speech was possibly in her a\r\n      result or at least an index of that gigantic volition which\r\n      during our long intercourse failed to give other and more\r\n      immediate evidence of its existence of all the women whom i have\r\n      ever known she the outwardly calm the everplacid ligeia was\r\n      the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern\r\n      passion and of such passion i could form no estimate save by\r\n      the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted\r\n      and appalled meby the almost magical melody modulation\r\n      distinctness and placidity of her very low voiceand by the\r\n      fierce energy rendered doubly effective by contrast with her\r\n      manner of utterance of the wild words which she habitually\r\n      uttered\r\n\r\n      i have spoken of the learning of ligeia it was immensesuch as i\r\n      have never known in woman in the classical tongues was she\r\n      deeply proficient and as far as my own acquaintance extended in\r\n      regard to the modern dialects of europe i have never known her\r\n      at fault indeed upon any theme of the most admired because\r\n      simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy\r\n      have i ever found ligeia at fault how singularlyhow\r\n      thrillingly this one point in the nature of my wife has forced\r\n      itself at this late period only upon my attention i said her\r\n      knowledge was such as i have never known in womanbut where\r\n      breathes the man who has traversed and successfully all the\r\n      wide areas of moral physical and mathematical science i saw\r\n      not then what i now clearly perceive that the acquisitions of\r\n      ligeia were gigantic were astounding yet i was sufficiently\r\n      aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself with a\r\n      childlike confidence to her guidance through the chaotic world\r\n      of metaphysical investigation at which i was most busily occupied\r\n      during the earlier years of our marriage with how vast a\r\n      triumphwith how vivid a delightwith how much of all that is\r\n      ethereal in hope did i feel as she bent over me in studies but\r\n      little soughtbut less knownthat delicious vista by slow degrees\r\n      expanding before me down whose long gorgeous and all untrodden\r\n      path i might at length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too\r\n      divinely precious not to be forbidden\r\n\r\n      how poignant then must have been the grief with which after\r\n      some years i beheld my wellgrounded expectations take wings to\r\n      themselves and fly away without ligeia i was but as a child\r\n      groping benighted her presence her readings alone rendered\r\n      vividly luminous the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in\r\n      which we were immersed wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes\r\n      letters lambent and golden grew duller than saturnian lead and\r\n      now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over\r\n      which i pored ligeia grew ill the wild eyes blazed with a\r\n      tootoo glorious effulgence the pale fingers became of the\r\n      transparent waxen hue of the grave and the blue veins upon the\r\n      lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the\r\n      gentle emotion i saw that she must dieand i struggled\r\n      desperately in spirit with the grim azrael and the struggles of\r\n      the passionate wife were to my astonishment even more energetic\r\n      than my own there had been much in her stern nature to impress\r\n      me with the belief that to her death would have come without\r\n      its terrors but not so words are impotent to convey any just\r\n      idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with\r\n      the shadow i groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle i\r\n      would have soothedi would have reasoned but in the intensity\r\n      of her wild desire for lifefor lifebut for lifesolace and\r\n      reason were the uttermost folly yet not until the last instance\r\n      amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit was\r\n      shaken the external placidity of her demeanor her voice grew\r\n      more gentlegrew more lowyet i would not wish to dwell upon the\r\n      wild meaning of the quietly uttered words my brain reeled as i\r\n      hearkened entranced to a melody more than mortalto assumptions\r\n      and aspirations which mortality had never before known\r\n\r\n      that she loved me i should not have doubted and i might have\r\n      been easily aware that in a bosom such as hers love would have\r\n      reigned no ordinary passion but in death only was i fully\r\n      impressed with the strength of her affection for long hours\r\n      detaining my hand would she pour out before me the overflowing\r\n      of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to\r\n      idolatry how had i deserved to be so blessed by such\r\n      confessionshow had i deserved to be so cursed with the removal\r\n      of my beloved in the hour of her making them but upon this\r\n      subject i cannot bear to dilate let me say only that in\r\n      ligeias more than womanly abandonment to a love alas all\r\n      unmerited all unworthily bestowed i at length recognized the\r\n      principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a desire for the\r\n      life which was now fleeing so rapidly away it is this wild\r\n      longingit is this eager vehemence of desire for lifebut for\r\n      lifethat i have no power to portrayno utterance capable of\r\n      expressing\r\n\r\n      at high noon of the night in which she departed beckoning me\r\n      peremptorily to her side she bade me repeat certain verses\r\n      composed by herself not many days before i obeyed her they were\r\n      these\r\n\r\nlo tis a gala night\r\n    within the lonesome latter years\r\nan angel throng bewinged

breathed her last sighs there came mingled with them a low\r\n      murmur from her lips i bent to them my ear and distinguished\r\n      again the concluding words of the passage in glanvillman doth\r\n      not yield him to the angels nor unto death utterly save only\r\n      through the weakness of his feeble will\r\n\r\n      she died and i crushed into the very dust with sorrow could no\r\n      longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and\r\n      decaying city by the rhine i had no lack of what the world calls\r\n      wealth ligeia had brought me far more very far more than\r\n      ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals after a few months\r\n      therefore of weary and aimless wandering i purchased and put\r\n      in some repair an abbey which i shall not name in one of the\r\n      wildest and least frequented portions of fair england the gloomy\r\n      and dreary grandeur of the building the almost savage aspect of\r\n      the domain the many melancholy and timehonored memories\r\n      connected with both had much in unison with the feelings of\r\n      utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and\r\n      unsocial region of the country yet although the external abbey\r\n      with its verdant decay hanging about it suffered but little\r\n      alteration i gave way with a childlike perversity and\r\n      perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows to a\r\n      display of more than regal magnificence within for such follies\r\n      even in childhood i had imbibed a taste and now they came back\r\n      to me as if in the dotage of grief alas i feel how much even of\r\n      incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and\r\n      fantastic draperies in the solemn carvings of egypt in the wild\r\n      cornices and furniture in the bedlam patterns of the carpets of\r\n      tufted gold i had become a bounden slave in the trammels of\r\n      opium and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my\r\n      dreams but these absurdities i must not pause to detail let me\r\n      speak only of that one chamber ever accursed whither in a\r\n      moment of mental alienation i led from the altar as my brideas\r\n      the successor of the unforgotten ligeiathe fairhaired and\r\n      blueeyed lady rowena trevanion of tremaine\r\n\r\n      there is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration\r\n      of that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me where\r\n      were the souls of the haughty family of the bride when through\r\n      thirst of gold they permitted to pass the threshold of an\r\n      apartment so bedecked a maiden and a daughter so beloved i have\r\n      said that i minutely remember the details of the chamberyet i am\r\n      sadly forgetful on topics of deep momentand here there was no\r\n      system no keeping in the fantastic display to take hold upon\r\n      the memory the room lay in a high turret of the castellated\r\n      abbey was pentagonal in shape and of capacious size occupying\r\n      the whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole windowan\r\n      immense sheet of unbroken glass from venicea single pane and\r\n      tinted of a leaden hue so that the rays of either the sun or\r\n      moon passing through it fell with a ghastly lustre on the\r\n      objects within over the upper portion of this huge window\r\n      extended the trellicework of an aged vine which clambered up\r\n      the massy walls of the turret the ceiling of gloomylooking\r\n      oak was excessively lofty vaulted and elaborately fretted with\r\n      the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semigothic\r\n      semidruidical device from out the most central recess of this\r\n      melancholy vaulting depended by a single chain of gold with\r\n      long links a huge censer of the same metal saracenic in\r\n      pattern and with many perforations so contrived that there\r\n      writhed in and out of them as if endued with a serpent vitality\r\n      a continual succession of particolored fires\r\n\r\n      some few ottomans and golden candelabra of eastern figure were\r\n      in various stations aboutand there was the couch toobridal\r\n      couchof an indian model and low and sculptured of solid ebony\r\n      with a palllike canopy above in each of the angles of the\r\n      chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite\r\n      from the tombs of the kings over against luxor with their aged\r\n      lids full of immemorial sculpture but in the draping of the\r\n      apartment lay alas the chief phantasy of all the lofty walls\r\n      gigantic in heighteven unproportionably sowere hung from summit\r\n      to foot in vast folds with a heavy and massivelooking\r\n      tapestrytapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet\r\n      on the floor as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed\r\n      as a canopy for the bed and as the gorgeous volutes of the\r\n      curtains which partially shaded the window the material was the\r\n      richest cloth of gold it was spotted all over at irregular\r\n      intervals with arabesque figures about a foot in diameter and\r\n      wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty black but\r\n      these figures partook of the true character of the arabesque only\r\n      when regarded from a single point of view by a contrivance now\r\n      common and indeed traceable to a very remote period of\r\n      antiquity they were made changeable in aspect to one entering\r\n      the room they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities but\r\n      upon a farther advance this appearance gradually departed and\r\n      step by step as the visitor moved his station in the chamber he\r\n      saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly\r\n      forms which belong to the superstition of the norman or arise in\r\n      the guilty slumbers of the monk the phantasmagoric effect was\r\n      vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong\r\n      continual current of wind behind the draperiesgiving a hideous\r\n      and uneasy animation to the whole\r\n\r\n      in halls such as thesein a bridal chamber such as thisi passed\r\n      with the lady of tremaine the unhallowed hours of the first\r\n      month of our marriagepassed them with but little disquietude\r\n      that my wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temperthat she\r\n      shunned me and loved me but littlei could not help perceiving\r\n      but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise i loathed her with\r\n      a hatred belonging more to demon than to man my memory flew\r\n      back oh with what intensity of regret to ligeia the\r\n      beloved the august the beautiful the entombed i revelled in\r\n      recollections of her purity of her wisdom of her lofty her\r\n      ethereal nature of her passionate her idolatrous love now\r\n      then did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the\r\n      fires of her own in the excitement of my opium dreams for i was\r\n      habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug i would call\r\n      aloud upon her name during the silence of the night or among\r\n      the sheltered recesses of the glens by day as if through the\r\n      wild eagerness the solemn passion the consuming ardor of my\r\n      longing for the departed i could restore her to the pathway she\r\n      had abandonedah could it be foreverupon the earth\r\n\r\n      about the commencement of the second month of the marriage the\r\n      lady rowena was attacked with sudden illness from which her\r\n      recovery was slow the fever which consumed her rendered her\r\n      nights uneasy and in her perturbed state of halfslumber she\r\n      spoke of sounds and of motions in and about the chamber of the\r\n      turret which i concluded had no origin save in the distemper of\r\n      her fancy or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences of the\r\n      chamber itself she became at length convalescentfinally well\r\n      yet but a brief period elapsed ere a second more violent\r\n      disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering and from this\r\n      attack her frame at all times feeble never altogether\r\n      recovered her illnesses were after this epoch of alarming\r\n      character and of more alarming recurrence defying alike the\r\n      knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians with the\r\n      increase of the chronic disease which had thus apparently taken\r\n      too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human\r\n      means i could not fail to observe a similar increase in the\r\n      nervous irritation of her temperament and in her excitability by\r\n      trivial causes of fear she spoke again and now more frequently\r\n      and pertinaciously of the soundsof the slight soundsand of the\r\n      unusual motions among the tapestries to which she had formerly\r\n      alluded\r\n\r\n      one night near the closing in of september she pressed this\r\n      distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my\r\n      attention she had just awakened from an unquiet slumber and i\r\n      had been watching with feelings half of anxiety half of vague\r\n      terror the workings of her emaciated countenance i sat by the\r\n      side of her ebony bed upon one of the ottomans of india she\r\n      partly arose and spoke in an earnest low whisper of sounds\r\n      which she then heard but which i could not hearof motions which\r\n      she then saw but which i could not perceive the wind was\r\n      rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries and i wished to show her\r\n      what let me confess it i could not all believe that those\r\n      almost inarticulate breathings and those very gentle variations\r\n      of the figures upon the wall were but the natural effects of\r\n      that customary rushing of the wind but a deadly pallor\r\n      overspreading her face had proved to me that my exertions to\r\n      reassure her would be fruitless she appeared to be fainting and\r\n      no attendants were within call i remembered where was deposited\r\n      a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her\r\n      physicians and hastened across the chamber to procure it but\r\n      as i stepped beneath the light of the censer two circumstances\r\n      of a startling nature attracted my attention i had felt that\r\n      some palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my\r\n      person and i saw that there lay upon the golden carpet in the\r\n      very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the censer a shadowa\r\n      faint indefinite shadow of angelic aspectsuch as might be\r\n      fancied for the shadow of a shade but i was wild with the\r\n      excitement of an immoderate dose of opium and heeded these\r\n      things but little nor spoke of them to rowena having found the\r\n      wine i recrossed the chamber and poured out a gobletful which\r\n      i held to the lips of the fainting lady she had now partially\r\n      recovered however and took the vessel herself while i sank\r\n      upon an ottoman near me with my eyes fastened upon her person\r\n      it was then that i became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall\r\n      upon the carpet and near the couch and in a second thereafter\r\n      as rowena was in the act of raising the wine to her lips i saw\r\n      or may have dreamed that i saw fall within the goblet as if\r\n      from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room three\r\n      or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid if\r\n      this i sawnot so rowena she swallowed the wine unhesitatingly\r\n      and i forbore to speak to her of a circumstance which must after\r\n      all i considered have been but the suggestion of a vivid\r\n      imagination rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady\r\n      by the opium and by the hour\r\n\r\n      yet i cannot conceal it from my own perception that immediately\r\n      subsequent to the fall of the rubydrops a rapid change for the\r\n      worse took place in the disorder of my wife so that on the\r\n      third subsequent night the hands of her menials prepared her for\r\n      the tomb and on the fourth i sat alone with her shrouded body\r\n      in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride\r\n      wild visions opiumengendered flitted shadowlike before me\r\n      i gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the\r\n      room upon the varying figures of the drapery and upon the\r\n      writhing of the particolored fires in the censer overhead my\r\n      eyes then fell as i called to mind the circumstances of a former\r\n      night to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where i had\r\n      seen the faint traces of the shadow it was there however no\r\n      longer and breathing with greater freedom i turned my glances\r\n      to the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed then rushed upon me\r\n      a thousand memories of ligeiaand then came back upon my heart\r\n      with the turbulent violence of a flood the whole of that\r\n      unutterable woe with which i had regarded her thus enshrouded\r\n      the night waned and still with a bosom full of bitter thoughts\r\n      of the one only and supremely beloved i remained gazing upon the\r\n      body of rowena\r\n\r\n      it might have been midnight or perhaps earlier or later for i\r\n      had taken no note of time when a sob low gentle but very\r\n      distinct startled me from my revery i felt that it came from\r\n      the bed of ebonythe bed of death i listened in an agony of\r\n      superstitious terrorbut there was no repetition of the sound i\r\n      strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpsebut there\r\n      was not the slightest perceptible yet i could not have been\r\n      deceived i had heard the noise however faint and my soul was\r\n      awakened within me i resolutely and perseveringly kept my\r\n      attention riveted upon the body many minutes elapsed before any\r\n      circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery at\r\n      length it became evident that a slight a very feeble and barely\r\n      noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks and\r\n      along the sunken small veins of the eyelids through a species of\r\n      unutterable horror and awe for which the language of mortality\r\n      has no sufficiently energetic expression i felt my heart cease\r\n      to beat my limbs grow rigid where i sat yet a sense of duty\r\n      finally operated to restore my selfpossession i could no longer\r\n      doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparationsthat\r\n      rowena still lived it was necessary that some immediate exertion\r\n      be made yet the turret was altogether apart from the portion of\r\n      the abbey tenanted by the servantsthere were none within calli\r\n      had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room\r\n      for many minutesand this i could not venture to do i therefore\r\n      struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit ill\r\n      hovering in a short period it was certain however that a\r\n      relapse had taken place the color disappeared from both eyelid\r\n      and cheek leaving a wanness even more than that of marble the\r\n      lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly\r\n      expression of death a repulsive clamminess and coldness\r\n      overspread rapidly the surface of the body and all the usual\r\n      rigorous illness immediately supervened i fell back with a\r\n      shudder upon the couch from which i had been so startlingly\r\n      aroused and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions of\r\n      ligeia\r\n\r\n      an hour thus elapsed when could it be possible i was a second\r\n      time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the\r\n      bed i listenedin extremity of horror the sound came againit\r\n      was a sigh rushing to the corpse i sawdistinctly sawa tremor\r\n      upon the lips in a minute afterward they relaxed disclosing a\r\n      bright line of the pearly teeth amazement now struggled in my\r\n      bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there\r\n      alone i felt that my vision grew dim that my reason wandered\r\n      and it was only by a violent effort that i at length succeeded in\r\n      nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had pointed\r\n      out there was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the\r\n      cheek and throat a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame\r\n      there was even a slight pulsation at the heart the lady lived\r\n      and with redoubled ardor i betook myself to the task of\r\n      restoration i chafed and bathed the temples and the hands and\r\n      used every exertion which experience and no little medical\r\n      reading could suggest but in vain suddenly the color fled\r\n      the pulsation ceased the lips resumed the expression of the\r\n      dead and in an instant afterward the whole body took upon\r\n      itself the icy chilliness the livid hue the intense rigidity\r\n      the sunken outline and all the loathsome peculiarities of that\r\n      which has been for many days a tenant of the tomb\r\n\r\n      and again i sunk into visions of ligeiaand again what marvel\r\n      that i shudder while i write again there reached my ears a low\r\n      sob from the region of the ebony bed but why shall i minutely\r\n      detail the unspeakable horrors of that night why shall i pause\r\n      to relate how time after time until near the period of the gray\r\n      dawn this hideous drama of revivification was repeated how each\r\n      terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more\r\n      irredeemable death how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle\r\n      with some invisible foe and how each struggle was succeeded by i\r\n      know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of the\r\n      corpse let me hurry to a conclusion\r\n\r\n      the greater part of the fearful night had worn away and she who\r\n      had been dead once again stirredand now more vigorously than\r\n      hitherto although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in\r\n      its utter hopelessness than any i had long ceased to struggle or\r\n      to move and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman a\r\n      helpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions of which extreme\r\n      awe was perhaps the least terrible the least consuming the\r\n      corpse i repeat stirred and now more vigorously than before\r\n      the hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the\r\n      countenancethe limbs relaxedand save that the eyelids were yet\r\n      pressed heavily together and that the bandages and draperies of\r\n      the grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure i\r\n      might have dreamed that rowena had indeed shaken off utterly\r\n      the fetters of death but if this idea was not even then\r\n      altogether adopted i could at least doubt no longer when\r\n      arising from the bed tottering with feeble steps with closed\r\n      eyes and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream the thing\r\n      that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the middle\r\n      of the apartment\r\n\r\n      i trembled noti stirred notfor a crowd of unutterable fancies\r\n      connected with the air the stature the demeanor of the figure\r\n      rushing hurriedly through my brain had paralyzedhad chilled me\r\n      into stone i stirred notbut gazed upon the apparition there\r\n      was a mad disorder in my thoughtsa tumult unappeasable could\r\n      it indeed be the living rowena who confronted me could it\r\n      indeed be rowena at allthe fairhaired the blueeyed lady\r\n      rowena trevanion of tremaine why why should i doubt it the\r\n      bandage lay heavily about the mouthbut then might it not be the\r\n      mouth of the breathing lady of tremaine and the cheeksthere\r\n      were the roses as in her noon of lifeyes these might indeed be\r\n      the fair cheeks of the living lady of tremaine and the chin\r\n      with its dimples as in health might it not be hersbut had she\r\n      then grown taller since her malady what inexpressible madness\r\n      seized me with that thought one bound and i had reached her\r\n      feet shrinking from my touch she let fall from her head\r\n      unloosened the ghastly cerements which had confined it and\r\n      there streamed forth into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber\r\n      huge masses of long and dishevelled hair it was blacker than\r\n      the raven wings of the midnight and now slowly opened the eyes\r\n      of the figure which stood before me here then at least i\r\n      shrieked aloud can i nevercan i never be mistakenthese are\r\n      the full and the black and the wild eyesof my lost loveof the\r\n      ladyof the lady ligeia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmorella\r\n\r\n\r\n     itself by itself solely one everlasting and single\r\n                    platosympos\r\n\r\n      with a feeling of deep yet most singular affection i regarded my\r\n      friend morella thrown by accident into her society many years\r\n      ago my soul from our first meeting burned with fires it had\r\n      never before known but the fires were not of eros and bitter\r\n      and tormenting to my spirit was the gradual conviction that i\r\n      could in no manner define their unusual meaning or regulate their\r\n      vague intensity yet we met and fate bound us together at the\r\n      altar and i never spoke of passion nor thought of love she\r\n      however shunned society and attaching herself to me alone\r\n      rendered me happy it is a happiness to wonder it is a happiness\r\n      to dream\r\n\r\n      morellas erudition was profound as i hope to live her talents\r\n      were of no common orderher powers of mind were gigantic i felt\r\n      this and in many matters became her pupil i soon however\r\n      found that perhaps on account of her presburg education she\r\n      placed before me a number of those mystical writings which are\r\n      usually considered the mere dross of the early german literature\r\n      these for what reason i could not imagine were her favourite\r\n      and constant studyand that in process of time they became my\r\n      own should be attributed to the simple but effectual influence\r\n      of habit and example\r\n\r\n      in all this if i err not my reason had little to do my\r\n      convictions or i forget myself were in no manner acted upon by\r\n      the ideal nor was any tincture of the mysticism which i read to\r\n      be discovered unless i am greatly mistaken either in my deeds\r\n      or in my thoughts persuaded of this i abandoned myself\r\n      implicitly to the guidance of my wife and entered with an\r\n      unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies and\r\n      thenthen when poring over forbidden pages i felt a forbidden\r\n      spirit enkindling within mewould morella place her cold hand\r\n      upon my own and rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some\r\n      low singular words whose strange meaning burned themselves in\r\n      upon my memory and then hour after hour would i linger by her\r\n      side and dwell upon the music of her voice until at length its\r\n      melody was tainted with terror and there fell a shadow upon my\r\n      soul and i grew pale and shuddered inwardly at those too\r\n      unearthly tones and thus joy suddenly faded into horror and\r\n      the most beautiful became the most hideous as hinnon became\r\n      gehenna\r\n\r\n      it is unnecessary to state the exact character of those\r\n      disquisitions which growing out of the volumes i have mentioned\r\n      formed for so long a time almost the sole conversation of\r\n      morella and myself by the learned in what might be termed\r\n      theological morality they will be readily conceived and by the\r\n      unlearned they would at all events be little understood the\r\n      wild pantheism of fichte the modified paliggenedia of the\r\n      pythagoreans and above all the doctrines of identity as urged\r\n      by schelling were generally the points of discussion presenting\r\n      the most of beauty to the imaginative morella that identity\r\n      which is termed personal mr locke i think truly defines to\r\n      consist in the saneness of rational being and since by person we\r\n      understand an intelligent essence having reason and since there\r\n      is a consciousness which always accompanies thinking it is this\r\n      which makes us all to be that which we call ourselvesthereby\r\n      distinguishing us from other beings that think and giving us our\r\n      personal identity but the principium indivduationis the\r\n      notion of that identity which at death is or is not lost\r\n      foreverwas to me at all times a consideration of intense\r\n      interest not more from the perplexing and exciting nature of its\r\n      consequences than from the marked and agitated manner in which\r\n      morella mentioned them\r\n\r\n      but indeed the time had now arrived when the mystery of my\r\n      wifes manner oppressed me as a spell i could no longer bear the\r\n      touch of her wan fingers nor the low tone of her musical\r\n      language nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes and she knew all\r\n      this but did not upbraid she seemed conscious of my weakness or\r\n      my folly and smiling called it fate she seemed also\r\n      conscious of a cause to me unknown for the gradual alienation\r\n      of my regard but she gave me no hint or token of its nature yet\r\n      was she woman and pined away daily in time the crimson spot\r\n      settled steadily upon the cheek and the blue veins upon the pale\r\n      forehead became prominent and one instant my nature melted into\r\n      pity but in next i met the glance of her meaning eyes and then\r\n      my soul sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who\r\n      gazes downward into some dreary and unfathomable abyss\r\n\r\n      shall i then say that i longed with an earnest and consuming\r\n      desire for the moment of morellas decease i did but the\r\n      fragile spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many daysfor\r\n      many weeks and irksome months until my tortured nerves obtained\r\n      the mastery over my mind and i grew furious through delay and\r\n      with the heart of a fiend cursed the days and the hours and the\r\n      bitter moments which seemed to lengthen and lengthen as her\r\n      gentle life declinedlike shadows in the dying of the day\r\n\r\n      but one autumnal evening when the winds lay still in heaven\r\n      morella called me to her bedside there was a dim mist over all\r\n      the earth and a warm glow upon the waters and amid the rich\r\n      october leaves of the forest a rainbow from the firmament had\r\n      surely fallen\r\n\r\n      it is a day of days she said as i approached a day of all\r\n      days either to live or die it is a fair day for the sons of\r\n      earth and lifeah more fair for the daughters of heaven and\r\n      death\r\n\r\n      i kissed her forehead and she continued\r\n\r\n      i am dying yet shall i live\r\n\r\n      morella\r\n\r\n      the days have never been when thou couldst love mebut her whom\r\n      in life thou didst abhor in death thou shalt adore\r\n\r\n      morella\r\n\r\n      i repeat that i am dying but within me is a pledge of that\r\n      affectionah how littlewhich thou didst feel for me morella\r\n      and when my spirit departs shall the child livethy child and\r\n      mine morellas but thy days shall be days of sorrowthat sorrow\r\n      which is the most lasting of impressions as the cypress is the\r\n      most enduring of trees for the hours of thy happiness are over\r\n      and joy is not gathered twice in a life as the roses of paestum\r\n      twice in a year thou shalt no longer then play the teian with\r\n      time but being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine thou shalt\r\n      bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth as do the moslemin\r\n      at mecca\r\n\r\n      morella i cried morella how knowest thou this but she\r\n      turned away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming\r\n      over her limbs she thus died and i heard her voice no more\r\n\r\n      yet as she had foretold her child to which in dying she had\r\n      given birth which breathed not until the mother breathed no\r\n      more her child a daughter lived and she grew strangely in\r\n      stature and intellect and was the perfect resemblance of her who\r\n      had departed and i loved her with a love more fervent than i had\r\n      believed it possible to feel for any denizen of earth\r\n\r\n      but ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened\r\n      and gloom and horror and grief swept over it in clouds i said\r\n      the child grew strangely in stature and intelligence strange\r\n      indeed was her rapid increase in bodily sizebut terrible oh\r\n      terrible were the tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while\r\n      watching the development of her mental being could it be\r\n      otherwise when i daily discovered in the conceptions of the\r\n      child the adult powers and faculties of the womanwhen the\r\n      lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy and when the\r\n      wisdom or the passions of maturity i found hourly gleaming from\r\n      its full and speculative eye when i say all this became\r\n      evident to my appalled senseswhen i could no longer hide it from\r\n      my soul nor throw it off from those perceptions which trembled\r\n      to receive itis it to be wondered at that suspicions of a\r\n      nature fearful and exciting crept in upon my spirit or that my\r\n      thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales and thrilling\r\n      theories of the entombed morella i snatched from the scrutiny of\r\n      the world a being whom destiny compelled me to adore and in the\r\n      rigorous seclusion of my home watched with an agonizing anxiety\r\n      over all which concerned the beloved\r\n\r\n      and as years rolled away and i gazed day after day upon her\r\n      holy and mild and eloquent face and poured over her maturing\r\n      form day after day did i discover new points of resemblance in\r\n      the child to her mother the melancholy and the dead and hourly\r\n      grew darker these shadows of similitude and more full and more\r\n      definite and more perplexing and more hideously terrible in\r\n      their aspect for that her smile was like her mothers i could\r\n      bear but then i shuddered at its too perfect identitythat her\r\n      eyes were like morellas i could endure but then they too\r\n      often looked down into the depths of my soul with morellas own\r\n      intense and bewildering meaning and in the contour of the high\r\n      forehead and in the ringlets of the silken hair and in the wan\r\n      fingers which buried themselves therein and in the sad musical\r\n      tones of her speech and above alloh above allin the phrases\r\n      and expressions of the dead on the lips of the loved and the\r\n      living i found food for consuming thought and horrorfor a worm\r\n      that would not die\r\n\r\n      thus passed away two lustra of her life and as yet my daughter\r\n      remained nameless upon the earth my child and my love were\r\n      the designations usually prompted by a fathers affection and\r\n      the rigid seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse\r\n      morellas name died with her at her death of the mother i had\r\n      never spoken to the daughterit was impossible to speak indeed\r\n      during the brief period of her existence the latter had received\r\n      no impressions from the outward world save such as might have\r\n      been afforded by the narrow limits of her privacy but at length\r\n      the ceremony of baptism presented to my mind in its unnerved and\r\n      agitated condition a present deliverance from the terrors of my\r\n      destiny and at the baptismal font i hesitated for a name and\r\n      many titles of the wise and beautiful of old and modern times\r\n      of my own and foreign lands came thronging to my lips with\r\n      many many fair titles of the gentle and the happy and the\r\n      good what prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried\r\n      dead what demon urged me to breathe that sound which in its\r\n      very recollection was wont to make ebb the purple blood in\r\n      torrents from the temples to the heart what fiend spoke from the\r\n      recesses of my soul when amid those dim aisles and in the\r\n      silence of the night i whispered within the ears of the holy man\r\n      the syllablesmorella what more than fiend convulsed the\r\n      features of my child and overspread them with hues of death as\r\n      starting at that scarcely audible sound she turned her glassy\r\n      eyes from the earth to heaven and falling prostrate on the black\r\n      slabs of our ancestral vault respondedi am here\r\n\r\n      distinct

epochnever nor was i indeed ignorant of the flowers and the\r\n      vinebut the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed me night and\r\n      day and i kept no reckoning of time or place and the stars of\r\n      my fate faded from heaven and therefore the earth grew dark and\r\n      its figures passed by me like flitting shadows and among them\r\n      all i beheld onlymorella the winds of the firmament breathed\r\n      but one sound within my ears and the ripples upon the sea\r\n      murmured evermoremorella but she died and with my own hands i\r\n      bore her to the tomb and i laughed

during the fall of the year  while residing near\r\n      charlottesville virginia i casually made the acquaintance of\r\n      mr augustus bedloe this young gentleman was remarkable in every\r\n      respect and excited in me a profound interest and curiosity i\r\n      found it impossible to comprehend him either in his moral or his\r\n      physical relations of his family i could obtain no

was broad and low his complexion was absolutely\r\n      bloodless his mouth was large and flexible and his teeth were\r\n      more wildly uneven although sound than i had ever before seen\r\n      teeth in a human head the expression of his smile however was\r\n      by no means unpleasing as might be supposed but it had no\r\n      variation whatever it was one of profound melancholyof a\r\n      phaseless and unceasing gloom his eyes were abnormally large\r\n      and round like those of a cat the pupils too upon any\r\n      accession or diminution of light underwent contraction or\r\n      dilation just such as is observed in the feline tribe in\r\n      moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost\r\n      inconceivable seeming to emit luminous rays not of a reflected\r\n      but of an intrinsic lustre as does a candle or the sun yet\r\n      their ordinary condition was so totally vapid filmy and dull as\r\n      to convey the idea of the eyes of a longinterred corpse\r\n\r\n      these peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much\r\n      annoyance and he was continually alluding to them in a sort of\r\n      half explanatory half apologetic strain which when i first\r\n      heard it impressed me very painfully i soon however grew\r\n      accustomed to it and my uneasiness wore off it seemed to be his\r\n      design rather to insinuate than directly to assert that\r\n      physically he had not always been what he wasthat a long series\r\n      of neuralgic attacks had reduced him from a condition of more\r\n      than usual personal beauty to that which i saw for many years\r\n      past he had been attended by a physician named templetonan old\r\n      gentleman perhaps seventy years of agewhom he had first\r\n      encountered at saratoga and from whose attention while there\r\n      he either received or fancied that he received great benefit\r\n      the result was that bedloe who was wealthy had made an\r\n      arrangement with dr templeton by which the latter in\r\n      consideration of a liberal annual allowance had consented to\r\n      devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the care of\r\n      the invalid\r\n\r\n      doctor templeton had been a traveller in his younger days and at\r\n      paris had become a convert in great measure to the doctrines of\r\n      mesmer it was altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he\r\n      had succeeded in alleviating the acute pains of his patient and\r\n      this success had very naturally inspired the latter with a\r\n      certain degree of confidence in the opinions from which the\r\n      remedies had been educed the doctor however like all\r\n      enthusiasts had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of his\r\n      pupil and finally so far gained his point as to induce the\r\n      sufferer to submit to numerous experiments by a frequent\r\n      repetition of these a result had arisen which of late days has\r\n      become so common as to attract little or no attention but which\r\n      at the period of which i write had very rarely been known in\r\n      america i mean to say that between doctor templeton and bedloe\r\n      there had grown up little by little a very distinct and\r\n      strongly marked rapport or magnetic relation i am not prepared\r\n      to assert however that this rapport extended beyond the limits\r\n      of the simple sleepproducing power but this power itself had\r\n      attained great intensity at the first attempt to induce the\r\n      magnetic somnolency the mesmerist entirely failed in the fifth\r\n      or sixth he succeeded very partially and after long continued\r\n      effort only at the twelfth was the triumph complete after this\r\n      the will of the patient succumbed rapidly to that of the\r\n      physician so that when i first became acquainted with the two\r\n      sleep was brought about almost instantaneously by the mere\r\n      volition of the operator even when the invalid was unaware of\r\n      his presence it is only now in the year  when similar\r\n      miracles are witnessed daily by thousands that i dare venture to\r\n      record this apparent impossibility as a matter of serious fact\r\n\r\n      the temperature of bedloe was in the highest degree sensitive\r\n      excitable enthusiastic his imagination was singularly vigorous\r\n      and creative and no doubt it derived additional force from the\r\n      habitual use of morphine which he swallowed in great quantity\r\n      and without which he would have found it impossible to exist it\r\n      was his practice to take a very large dose of it immediately\r\n      after breakfast each morningor rather immediately after a cup\r\n      of strong coffee for he ate nothing in the forenoonand then set\r\n      forth alone or attended only by a dog upon a long ramble among\r\n      the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward and\r\n      southward of charlottesville and are there dignified by the\r\n      title of the ragged mountains\r\n\r\n      upon a dim warm misty day toward the close of november and\r\n      during the strange interregnum of the seasons which in america is\r\n      termed the indian summer mr bedloe departed as usual for the\r\n      hills the day passed and still he did not return\r\n\r\n      about eight oclock at night having become seriously alarmed at\r\n      his protracted absence we were about setting out in search of\r\n      him when he unexpectedly made his appearance in health no worse\r\n      than usual and in rather more than ordinary spirits the account\r\n      which he gave of his expedition and of the events which had\r\n      detained him was a singular one indeed\r\n\r\n      you will remember said he that it was about nine in the\r\n      morning when i left charlottesville i bent my steps immediately\r\n      to the mountains and about ten entered a gorge which was\r\n      entirely new to me i followed the windings of this pass with\r\n      much interest the scenery which presented itself on all sides\r\n      although scarcely entitled to be called grand had about it an\r\n      indescribable and to me a delicious aspect of dreary desolation\r\n      the solitude seemed absolutely virgin i could not help believing\r\n      that the green sods and the gray rocks upon which i trod had been\r\n      trodden never before by the foot of a human being so entirely\r\n      secluded and in fact inaccessible except through a series of\r\n      accidents is the entrance of the ravine that it is by no means\r\n      impossible that i was indeed the first adventurerthe very first\r\n      and sole adventurer who had ever penetrated its recesses\r\n\r\n      the thick and peculiar mist or smoke which distinguishes the\r\n      indian summer and which now hung heavily over all objects\r\n      served no doubt to deepen the vague impressions which these\r\n      objects created so dense was this pleasant fog that i could at\r\n      no time see more than a dozen yards of the path before me this\r\n      path was excessively sinuous and as the sun could not be seen i\r\n      soon lost all idea of the direction in which i journeyed in the\r\n      meantime the morphine had its customary effectthat of enduing\r\n      all the external world with an intensity of interest in the\r\n      quivering of a leafin the hue of a blade of grassin the shape\r\n      of a trefoilin the humming of a beein the gleaming of a\r\n      dewdropin the breathing of the windin the faint odors that\r\n      came from the forestthere came a whole universe of suggestiona\r\n      gay and motley train of rhapsodical and immethodical thought\r\n\r\n      busied in this i walked on for several hours during which the\r\n      mist deepened around me to so great an extent that at length i\r\n      was reduced to an absolute groping of the way and now an\r\n      indescribable uneasiness possessed mea species of nervous\r\n      hesitation and tremor i feared to tread lest i should be\r\n      precipitated into some abyss i remembered too strange stories\r\n      told about these ragged hills and of the uncouth and fierce\r\n      races of men who tenanted their groves and caverns a thousand\r\n      vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted mefancies the more\r\n      distressing because vague very suddenly my attention was\r\n      arrested by the loud beating of a drum\r\n\r\n      my amazement was of course extreme a drum in these hills was\r\n      a thing unknown i could not have been more surprised at the\r\n      sound of the trump of the archangel but a new and still more\r\n      astounding source of interest and perplexity arose there came a\r\n      wild rattling or jingling sound as if of a bunch of large keys\r\n      and upon the instant a duskyvisaged and halfnaked man rushed\r\n      past me with a shriek he came so close to my person that i felt\r\n      his hot breath upon my face he bore in one hand an instrument\r\n      composed of an assemblage of steel rings and shook them\r\n      vigorously as he ran scarcely had he disappeared in the mist\r\n      before panting after him with open mouth and glaring eyes\r\n      there darted a huge beast i could not be mistaken in its\r\n      character it was a hyena\r\n\r\n      the sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my\r\n      terrorsfor i now made sure that i dreamed and endeavored to\r\n      arouse myself to waking consciousness i stepped boldly and\r\n      briskly forward i rubbed my eyes i called aloud i pinched my\r\n      limbs a small spring of water presented itself to my view and\r\n      here stooping i bathed my hands and my head and neck this\r\n      seemed to dissipate the equivocal sensations which had hitherto\r\n      annoyed me i arose as i thought a new man and proceeded\r\n      steadily and complacently on my unknown way\r\n\r\n      at length quite overcome by exertion and by a certain\r\n      oppressive closeness of the atmosphere i seated myself beneath a\r\n      tree presently there came a feeble gleam of sunshine and the\r\n      shadow of the leaves of the tree fell faintly but definitely upon\r\n      the grass at this shadow i gazed wonderingly for many minutes\r\n      its character stupefied me with astonishment i looked upward\r\n      the tree was a palm\r\n\r\n      i now arose hurriedly and in a state of fearful agitationfor\r\n      the fancy that i dreamed would serve me no longer i sawi felt\r\n      that i had perfect command of my sensesand these senses now\r\n      brought to my soul a world of novel and singular sensation the\r\n      heat became all at once intolerable a strange odor loaded the\r\n      breeze a low continuous murmur like that arising from a full\r\n      but gently flowing river came to my ears intermingled with the\r\n      peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices\r\n\r\n      while i listened in an extremity of astonishment which i need\r\n      not attempt to describe a strong and brief gust of wind bore off\r\n      the incumbent fog as if by the wand of an enchanter\r\n\r\n      i found myself at the foot of a high mountain and looking down\r\n      into a vast plain through which wound a majestic river on the\r\n      margin of this river stood an easternlooking city such as we\r\n      read of in the arabian tales but of a character even more\r\n      singular than any there described from my position which was\r\n      far above the level of the town i could perceive its every nook\r\n      and corner as if delineated on a map the streets seemed\r\n      innumerable and crossed each other irregularly in all\r\n      directions but were rather long winding alleys than streets and\r\n      absolutely swarmed with inhabitants the houses were wildly\r\n      picturesque on every hand was a wilderness of balconies of\r\n      verandas of minarets of shrines and fantastically carved\r\n      oriels bazaars abounded and in these were displayed rich wares\r\n      in infinite variety and profusionsilks muslins the most\r\n      dazzling cutlery the most magnificent jewels and gems besides\r\n      these things were seen on all sides banners and palanquins\r\n      litters with stately dames closeveiled elephants gorgeously\r\n      caparisoned idols grotesquely hewn drums banners and gongs\r\n      spears silver and gilded maces and amid the crowd and the\r\n      clamor and the general intricacy and confusionamid the million\r\n      of black and yellow men turbaned and robed and of flowing\r\n      beard there roamed a countless multitude of holy filleted bulls\r\n      while vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered\r\n      chattering and shrieking about the cornices of the mosques or\r\n      clung to the minarets and oriels from the swarming streets to\r\n      the banks of the river there descended innumerable flights of\r\n      steps leading to bathing places while the river itself seemed to\r\n      force a passage with difficulty through the vast fleets of\r\n      deeplyburthened ships that far and wide encountered its surface\r\n      beyond the limits of the city arose in frequent majestic groups\r\n      the palm and the cocoa with other gigantic and weird trees of\r\n      vast age and here and there might be seen a field of rice the\r\n      thatched hut of a peasant a tank a stray temple a gypsy camp\r\n      or a solitary graceful maiden taking her way with a pitcher upon\r\n      her head to the banks of the magnificent river\r\n\r\n      you will say now of course that i dreamed but not so what i\r\n      sawwhat i heardwhat i feltwhat i thoughthad about it nothing\r\n      of the unmistakable idiosyncrasy of the dream all was rigorously\r\n      selfconsistent at first doubting that i was really awake i\r\n      entered into a series of tests which soon convinced me that i\r\n      really was now when one dreams and in the dream suspects\r\n      that he dreams the suspicion never fails to confirm itself and\r\n      the sleeper is almost immediately aroused thus novalis errs not\r\n      in saying that we are near waking when we dream that we dream\r\n      had the vision occurred to me as i describe it without my\r\n      suspecting it as a dream then a dream it might absolutely have\r\n      been but occurring as it did and suspected and tested as it\r\n      was i am forced to class it among other phenomena\r\n\r\n      in this i am not sure that you are wrong observed dr\r\n      templeton but proceed you arose and descended into the city\r\n\r\n      i arose continued bedloe regarding the doctor with an air of\r\n      profound astonishment i arose as you say and descended into\r\n      the city on my way i fell in with an immense populace crowding\r\n      through every avenue all in the same direction and exhibiting\r\n      in every action the wildest excitement very suddenly and by\r\n      some inconceivable impulse i became intensely imbued with\r\n      personal interest in what was going on i seemed to feel that i\r\n      had an important part to play without exactly understanding what\r\n      it was against the crowd which environed me however i\r\n      experienced a deep sentiment of animosity i shrank from amid\r\n      them and swiftly by a circuitous path reached and entered the\r\n      city here all was the wildest tumult and contention a small\r\n      party of men clad in garments half indian half european and\r\n      officered by gentlemen in a uniform partly british were engaged\r\n      at great odds with the swarming rabble of the alleys i joined\r\n      the weaker party arming myself with the weapons of a fallen\r\n      officer and fighting i knew not whom with the nervous ferocity\r\n      of despair we were soon overpowered by numbers and driven to\r\n      seek refuge in a species of kiosk here we barricaded ourselves\r\n      and for the present were secure from a loophole near the\r\n      summit of the kiosk i perceived a vast crowd in furious\r\n      agitation surrounding and assaulting a gay palace that overhung\r\n      the river presently from an upper window of this place there\r\n      descended an effeminatelooking person by means of a string made\r\n      of the turbans of his attendants a boat was at hand in which he\r\n      escaped to the opposite bank of the river\r\n\r\n      and now a new object took possession of my soul i spoke a few\r\n      hurried but energetic words to my companions and having\r\n      succeeded in gaining over a few of them to my purpose made a\r\n      frantic sally from the kiosk we rushed amid the crowd that\r\n      surrounded it they retreated at first before us they rallied\r\n      fought madly and retreated again in the mean time we were borne\r\n      far from the kiosk and became bewildered and entangled among the\r\n      narrow streets of tall overhanging houses into the recesses of\r\n      which the sun had never been able to shine the rabble pressed\r\n      impetuously upon us harrassing us with their spears and\r\n      overwhelming us with flights of arrows these latter were very\r\n      remarkable and resembled in some respects the writhing creese of\r\n      the malay they were made to imitate the body of a creeping\r\n      serpent and were long and black with a poisoned barb one of\r\n      them struck me upon the right temple i reeled and fell an\r\n      instantaneous and dreadful sickness seized me i struggledi\r\n      gaspedi died\r\n\r\n       you will hardly persist now said i smiling that the whole\r\n       of your adventure was not a dream you are not prepared to\r\n       maintain that you are dead\r\n\r\n      when i said these words i of course expected some lively sally\r\n      from bedloe in reply but to my astonishment he hesitated\r\n      trembled became fearfully pallid and remained silent i looked\r\n      toward templeton he sat erect and rigid in his chairhis teeth\r\n      chattered and his eyes were starting from their sockets\r\n      proceed he at length said hoarsely to bedloe\r\n\r\n      for many minutes continued the latter my sole sentimentmy\r\n      sole feelingwas that of darkness and nonentity with the\r\n      consciousness of death at length there seemed to pass a violent\r\n      and sudden shock through my soul as if of electricity with it\r\n      came the sense of elasticity and of light this latter i feltnot\r\n      saw in an instant i seemed to rise from the ground but i had no\r\n      bodily no visible audible or palpable presence the crowd had\r\n      departed the tumult had ceased the city was in comparative\r\n      repose beneath me lay my corpse with the arrow in my temple\r\n      the whole head greatly swollen and disfigured but all these\r\n      things i feltnot saw i took interest in nothing even the\r\n      corpse seemed a matter in which i had no concern volition i had\r\n      none but appeared to be impelled into motion and flitted\r\n      buoyantly out of the city retracing the circuitous path by which\r\n      i had entered it when i had attained that point of the ravine in\r\n      the mountains at which i had encountered the hyena i again\r\n      experienced a shock as of a galvanic battery the sense of\r\n      weight of volition of substance returned i became my original\r\n      self and bent my steps eagerly homewardbut the past had not\r\n      lost the vividness of the realand not now even for an instant\r\n      can i compel my understanding to regard it as a dream\r\n\r\n      nor was it said templeton with an air of deep solemnity yet\r\n      it would be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed\r\n      let us suppose only that the soul of the man of today is upon\r\n      the verge of some stupendous psychal discoveries let us content\r\n      ourselves with this supposition for the rest i have some\r\n      explanation to make here is a watercolor drawing which i should\r\n      have shown you before but which an unaccountable sentiment of\r\n      horror has hitherto prevented me from showing\r\n\r\n      we looked at the picture which he presented i saw nothing in it\r\n      of an extraordinary character but its effect upon bedloe was\r\n      prodigious he nearly fainted as he gazed and yet it was but a\r\n      miniature portraita miraculously accurate one to be sureof his\r\n      own very remarkable features at least this was my thought as i\r\n      regarded it\r\n\r\n      you will perceive said templeton the date of this pictureit\r\n      is here scarcely visible in this corner in this year was\r\n      the portrait taken it is the likeness of a dead frienda mr\r\n      oldebto whom i became much attached at calcutta during the\r\n      administration of warren hastings i was then only twenty years\r\n      old when i first saw you mr bedloe at saratoga it was the\r\n      miraculous similarity which existed between yourself and the\r\n      painting which induced me to accost you to seek your friendship\r\n      and to bring about those arrangements which resulted in my\r\n      becoming your constant companion in accomplishing this point i\r\n      was urged partly and perhaps principally by a regretful memory\r\n      of the deceased but also in part by an uneasy and not\r\n      altogether horrorless curiosity respecting yourself\r\n\r\n      in your detail of the vision which presented itself to you amid\r\n      the hills you have described with the minutest accuracy the\r\n      indian city of benares upon the holy river the riots the\r\n      combat the massacre were the actual events of the insurrection\r\n      of cheyte sing which took place in  when hastings was put\r\n      in imminent peril of his life the man escaping by the string of\r\n      turbans was cheyte sing himself the party in the kiosk were\r\n      sepoys and british officers headed by hastings of this party i\r\n      was one and did all i could to prevent the rash and fatal sally\r\n      of the officer who fell in the crowded alleys by the poisoned\r\n      arrow of a bengalee that officer was my dearest friend it was\r\n      oldeb you will perceive by these manuscripts here the speaker\r\n      produced a notebook in which several pages appeared to have been\r\n      freshly written that at the very period in which you fancied\r\n      these things amid the hills i was engaged in detailing them upon\r\n      paper here at home\r\n\r\n      in about a week after this conversation the following paragraphs\r\n      appeared in a charlottesville paper\r\n\r\n      we have the painful duty of announcing the death of mr augustus\r\n      bedlo a gentleman whose amiable manners and many virtues have\r\n      long endeared him to the citizens of charlottesville\r\n\r\n      mr b for some years past has been subject to neuralgia\r\n      which has often threatened to terminate fatally but this can be\r\n      regarded only as the mediate cause of his decease the proximate\r\n      cause was one of especial singularity in an excursion to the\r\n      ragged mountains a few days since a slight cold and fever were\r\n      contracted attended with great determination of blood to the\r\n      head to relieve this dr templeton resorted to topical\r\n      bleeding leeches were applied to the temples in a fearfully\r\n      brief period the patient died when it appeared that in the jar\r\n      containing the leeches had been introduced by accident one of\r\n      the venomous vermicular sangsues which are now and then found in\r\n      the neighboring ponds this creature fastened itself upon a small\r\n      artery in the right temple its close resemblance to the\r\n      medicinal leech caused the mistake to be overlooked until too\r\n      late\r\n\r\n      n bthe poisonous sangsue of charlottesville may always be\r\n      distinguished from the medicinal leech by its blackness and\r\n      especially by its writhing or vermicular motions which very\r\n      nearly resemble those of a snake\r\n\r\n      i was speaking with the editor of the paper in question upon the\r\n      topic of this remarkable accident when it occurred to me to ask\r\n      how it happened that the name of the deceased had been given as\r\n      bedlo\r\n\r\n      i presume i said you have authority for this spelling but i\r\n      have always supposed the name to be written with an e at the\r\n      end\r\n\r\n      authorityno he replied it is a mere typographical error\r\n      the name is bedlo with an e all the world over and i never knew\r\n      it to be spelt otherwise in my life\r\n\r\n      then said i mutteringly as i turned upon my heel then\r\n      indeed has it come to pass that one truth is stranger than any\r\n      fictionfor bedloe without the e what is it but oldeb\r\n      conversed and this man tells me that it is a typographical\r\n      error\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe spectacles\r\n\r\n\r\n      many years ago it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of love\r\n      at first sight but those who think not less than those who\r\n      feel deeply have always advocated its existence modern\r\n      discoveries indeed in what may be termed ethical magnetism or\r\n      magnetoesthetics render it probable that the most natural and\r\n      consequently the truest and most intense of the human affections\r\n      are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathyin\r\n      a word that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal\r\n      fetters are those which are riveted by a glance the confession i\r\n      am about to make will add another to the already almost\r\n      innumerable instances of the truth of the position\r\n\r\n      my story requires that i should be somewhat minute i am still a\r\n      very young mannot yet twentytwo years of age my name at\r\n      present is a very usual and rather plebeian onesimpson i say\r\n      at present for it is only lately that i have been so\r\n      calledhaving legislatively adopted this surname within the last\r\n      year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant\r\n      male relative adolphus simpson esq the bequest was conditioned\r\n      upon my taking the name of the testatorthe family not the\r\n      christian name my christian name is napoleon bonaparteor more\r\n      properly these are my first and middle appellations\r\n\r\n      i assumed the name simpson with some reluctance as in my true\r\n      patronym froissart i felt a very pardonable pridebelieving\r\n      that i could trace a descent from the immortal author of the\r\n      chronicles while on the subject of names by the bye i may\r\n      mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of\r\n      some of my immediate predecessors my father was a monsieur\r\n      froissart of paris his wifemy mother whom he married at\r\n      fifteenwas a mademoiselle croissart eldest daughter of\r\n      croissart the banker whose wife again being only sixteen when\r\n      married was the eldest daughter of one victor voissart monsieur\r\n      voissart very singularly had married a lady of similar namea\r\n      mademoiselle moissart she too was quite a child when married\r\n      and her mother also madame moissart was only fourteen when led\r\n      to the altar these early marriages are usual in france here\r\n      however are moissart voissart croissart and froissart all in\r\n      the direct line of descent my own name though as i say became\r\n      simpson by act of legislature and with so much repugnance on my\r\n      part that at one period i actually hesitated about accepting\r\n      the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached\r\n\r\n      as to personal endowments i am by no means deficient on the\r\n      contrary i believe that i am well made and possess what nine\r\n      tenths of the world would call a handsome face in height i am\r\n      five feet eleven my hair is black and curling my nose is\r\n      sufficiently good my eyes are large and gray and although in\r\n      fact they are weak to a very inconvenient degree still no defect\r\n      in this regard would be suspected from their appearance the\r\n      weakness itself however has always much annoyed me and i have\r\n      resorted to every remedyshort of wearing glasses being youthful\r\n      and goodlooking i naturally dislike these and have resolutely\r\n      refused to employ them i know nothing indeed which so\r\n      disfigures the countenance of a young person or so impresses\r\n      every feature with an air of demureness if not altogether of\r\n      sanctimoniousness and of age an eyeglass on the other hand has\r\n      a savor of downright foppery and affectation i have hitherto\r\n      managed as well as i could without either but something too much\r\n      of these merely personal details which after all are of little\r\n      importance i will content myself with saying in addition that\r\n      my temperament is sanguine rash ardent enthusiasticand that\r\n      all my life i have been a devoted admirer of the women\r\n\r\n      one night last winter i entered a box at the p theatre in\r\n      company with a friend mr talbot it was an opera night and the\r\n      bills presented a very rare attraction so that the house was\r\n      excessively crowded we were in time however to obtain the\r\n      front seats which had been reserved for us and into which with\r\n      some little difficulty we elbowed our way\r\n\r\n      for two hours my companion who was a musical fanatico gave his\r\n      undivided attention to the stage and in the meantime i amused\r\n      myself by observing the audience which consisted in chief part\r\n      of the very elite of the city having satisfied myself upon this\r\n      point i was about turning my eyes to the prima donna when they\r\n      were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes\r\n      which had escaped my observation\r\n\r\n      if i live a thousand years i can never forget the intense\r\n      emotion with which i regarded this figure it was that of a\r\n      female the most exquisite i had ever beheld the face was so far\r\n      turned toward the stage that for some minutes i could not\r\n      obtain a view of itbut the form was divine no other word can\r\n      sufficiently express its magnificent proportionand even the term\r\n      divine seems ridiculously feeble as i write it\r\n\r\n      the magic of a lovely form in womanthe necromancy of female\r\n      gracefulnesswas always a power which i had found it impossible\r\n      to resist but here was grace personified incarnate the beau\r\n      ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions the figure\r\n      almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be\r\n      seen was somewhat above the medium height and nearly\r\n      approached without positively reaching the majestic its\r\n      perfect fullness and tournure were delicious the head of which\r\n      only the back was visible rivalled in outline that of the greek\r\n      psyche and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap\r\n      of gaze äérienne which put me in mind of the ventum textilem\r\n      of apuleius the right arm hung over the balustrade of the box\r\n      and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry\r\n      its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves\r\n      now in fashion this extended but little below the elbow beneath\r\n      it was worn an under one of some frail material closefitting\r\n      and terminated by a cuff of rich lace which fell gracefully over\r\n      the top of the hand revealing only the delicate fingers upon\r\n      one of which sparkled a diamond ring which i at once saw was of\r\n      extraordinary value the admirable roundness of the wrist was\r\n      well set off by a bracelet which encircled it and which also was\r\n      ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of\r\n      jewelstelling in words that could not be mistaken at once of\r\n      the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer\r\n\r\n      i gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour as\r\n      if i had been suddenly converted to stone and during this\r\n      period i felt the full force and truth of all that has been said\r\n      or sung concerning love at first sight my feelings were\r\n      totally different from any which i had hitherto experienced in\r\n      the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female\r\n      loveliness an unaccountable and what i am compelled to consider\r\n      a magnetic sympathy of soul for soul seemed to rivet not only\r\n      my vision but my whole powers of thought and feeling upon the\r\n      admirable object before me i sawi felti knew that i was\r\n      deeply madly irrevocably in loveand this even before seeing\r\n      the face of the person beloved so intense indeed was the\r\n      passion that consumed me that i really believe it would have\r\n      received little if any abatement had the features yet unseen\r\n      proved of merely ordinary character so anomalous is the nature\r\n      of the only true loveof the love at first sightand so little\r\n      really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only\r\n      seem to create and control it\r\n\r\n      while i was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision a\r\n      sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head\r\n      partially toward me so that i beheld the entire profile of the\r\n      face its beauty even exceeded my anticipationsand yet there was\r\n      something about it which disappointed me without my being able to\r\n      tell exactly what it was i said disappointed but this is not\r\n      altogether the word my sentiments were at once quieted and\r\n      exalted they partook less of transport and more of calm\r\n      enthusiasmof enthusiastic repose this state of feeling arose\r\n      perhaps from the madonnalike and matronly air of the face and\r\n      yet i at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely\r\n      from this there was something elsesome mystery which i could\r\n      not developesome expression about the countenance which slightly\r\n      disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest in fact i\r\n      was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and\r\n      susceptible man for any act of extravagance had the lady been\r\n      alone i should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her\r\n      at all hazards but fortunately she was attended by two\r\n      companionsa gentleman and a strikingly beautiful woman to all\r\n      appearance a few years younger than herself\r\n\r\n      i revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which i might obtain\r\n      hereafter an introduction to the elder lady or for the\r\n      present at all events a more distinct view of her beauty i\r\n      would have removed my position to one nearer her own but the\r\n      crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible and the\r\n      stern decrees of fashion had of late imperatively prohibited\r\n      the use of the operaglass in a case such as this even had i\r\n      been so fortunate as to have one with mebut i had notand was\r\n      thus in despair\r\n\r\n      at length i bethought me of applying to my companion\r\n\r\n      talbot i said you have an operaglass let me have it\r\n\r\n      an operaglassnowhat do you suppose i would be doing with an\r\n      operaglass here he turned impatiently toward the stage\r\n\r\n      but talbot i continued pulling him by the shoulder listen\r\n      to me will you do you see the stageboxthereno the next\r\n      did you ever behold as lovely a woman\r\n\r\n      she is very beautiful no doubt he said\r\n\r\n      i wonder who she can be\r\n\r\n      why in the name of all that is angelic dont you know who she\r\n      is not to know her argues yourself unknown she is the\r\n      celebrated madame lalandethe beauty of the day par excellence\r\n      and the talk of the whole town immensely wealthy tooa widow\r\n      and a great matchhas just arrived from paris\r\n\r\n      do you know her\r\n\r\n      yes i have the honor\r\n\r\n      will you introduce me\r\n\r\n      assuredly with the greatest pleasure when shall it be\r\n\r\n      tomorrow at one i will call upon you at bs\r\n\r\n      very good and now do hold your tongue if you can\r\n\r\n      in this latter respect i was forced to take talbots advice for\r\n      he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or\r\n      suggestion and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the\r\n      evening with what was transacting upon the stage\r\n\r\n      in the meantime i kept my eyes riveted on madame lalande and at\r\n      length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her\r\n      face it was exquisitely lovelythis of course my heart had\r\n      told me before even had not talbot fully satisfied me upon the\r\n      pointbut still the unintelligible something disturbed me i\r\n      finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air\r\n      of gravity sadness or still more properly of weariness which\r\n      took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance\r\n      only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty and\r\n      thus of course to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment with\r\n      an interest tenfold\r\n\r\n      while i thus feasted my eyes i perceived at last to my great\r\n      trepidation by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the\r\n      lady that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my\r\n      gaze still i was absolutely fascinated and could not withdraw\r\n      it even for an instant she turned aside her face and again i\r\n      saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head\r\n      after some minutes as if urged by curiosity to see if i was\r\n      still looking she gradually brought her face again around and\r\n      again encountered my burning gaze her large dark eyes fell\r\n      instantly and a deep blush mantled her cheek but what was my\r\n      astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second\r\n      time avert her head but that she actually took from her girdle a\r\n      double eyeglasselevated itadjusted itand then regarded me\r\n      through it intently and deliberately for the space of several\r\n      minutes\r\n\r\n      had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet i could not have been more\r\n      thoroughly astoundedastounded onlynot offended or disgusted in\r\n      the slightest degree although an action so bold in any other\r\n      woman would have been likely to offend or disgust but the whole\r\n      thing was done with so much quietudeso much nonchalanceso much\r\n      reposewith so evident an air of the highest breeding in\r\n      shortthat nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible and my\r\n      sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise\r\n\r\n      i observed that upon her first elevation of the glass she had\r\n      seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person and\r\n      was withdrawing the instrument when as if struck by a second\r\n      thought she resumed it and so continued to regard me with fixed\r\n      attention for the space of several minutesfor five minutes at\r\n      the very least i am sure\r\n\r\n      this action so remarkable in an american theatre attracted very\r\n      general observation and gave rise to an indefinite movement or\r\n      buzz among the audience which for a moment filled me with\r\n      confusion but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of\r\n      madame lalande\r\n\r\n      having satisfied her curiosityif such it wasshe dropped the\r\n      glass and quietly gave her attention again to the stage her\r\n      profile now being turned toward myself as before i continued to\r\n      watch her unremittingly although i was fully conscious of my\r\n      rudeness in so doing presently i saw the head slowly and\r\n      slightly change its position and soon i became convinced that\r\n      the lady while pretending to look at the stage was in fact\r\n      attentively regarding myself it is needless to say what effect\r\n      this conduct on the part of so fascinating a woman had upon my\r\n      excitable mind\r\n\r\n      having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour the\r\n      fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended\r\n      her and while she spoke i saw distinctly by the glances of\r\n      both that the conversation had reference to myself\r\n\r\n      upon its conclusion madame lalande again turned toward the\r\n      stage and for a few minutes seemed absorbed in the\r\n      performance at the expiration of this period however i was\r\n      thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold for\r\n      the second time the eyeglass which hung at her side fully\r\n      confront me as before and disregarding the renewed buzz of the\r\n      audience survey me from head to foot with the same miraculous\r\n      composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my\r\n      soul\r\n\r\n      this extraordinary behavior by throwing me into a perfect fever\r\n      of excitementinto an absolute delirium of loveserved rather to\r\n      embolden than to disconcert me in the mad intensity of my\r\n      devotion i forgot everything but the presence and the majestic\r\n      loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze watching my\r\n      opportunity when i thought the audience were fully engaged with\r\n      the opera i at length caught the eyes of madame lalande and\r\n      upon the instant made a slight but unmistakable bow\r\n\r\n      she blushed very deeplythen averted her eyesthen slowly and\r\n      cautiously looked around apparently to see if my rash action had\r\n      been noticedthen leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her\r\n      side\r\n\r\n      i now felt a burning sense of the impropriety i had committed\r\n      and expected nothing less than instant exposure while a vision\r\n      of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably\r\n      through my brain i was greatly and immediately relieved\r\n      however when i saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a\r\n      playbill without speaking but the reader may form some feeble\r\n      conception of my astonishmentof my profound amazementmy\r\n      delirious bewilderment of heart and soulwhen instantly\r\n      afterward having again glanced furtively around she allowed her\r\n      bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own and then with\r\n      a faint smile disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth made\r\n      two distinct pointed and unequivocal affirmative inclinations\r\n      of the head\r\n\r\n      it is useless of course to dwell upon my joyupon my\r\n      transportupon my illimitable ecstasy of heart if ever man was\r\n      mad with excess of happiness it was myself at that moment i\r\n      loved this was my first loveso i felt it to be it was love\r\n      supremeindescribable it was love at first sight and at first\r\n      sight too it had been appreciated and returned\r\n\r\n      yes returned how and why should i doubt it for an instant what\r\n      other construction could i possibly put upon such conduct on the\r\n      part of a lady so beautifulso wealthyevidently so\r\n      accomplishedof so high breedingof so lofty a position in\r\n      societyin every regard so entirely respectable as i felt assured\r\n      was madame lalande yes she loved meshe returned the enthusiasm\r\n      of my love with an enthusiasm as blindas uncompromisingas\r\n      uncalculatingas abandonedand as utterly unbounded as my own\r\n      these delicious fancies and reflections however were now\r\n      interrupted by the falling of the dropcurtain the audience\r\n      arose and the usual tumult immediately supervened quitting\r\n      talbot abruptly i made every effort to force my way into closer\r\n      proximity with madame lalande having failed in this on account\r\n      of the crowd i at length gave up the chase and bent my steps\r\n      homeward consoling myself for my disappointment in not having\r\n      been able to touch even the hem of her robe by the reflection\r\n      that i should be introduced by talbot in due form upon the\r\n      morrow\r\n\r\n      this morrow at last came that is to say a day finally dawned\r\n      upon a long and weary night of impatience and then the hours\r\n      until one were snailpaced dreary and innumerable but even\r\n      stamboul it is said shall have an end and there came an end to\r\n      this long delay the clock struck as the last echo ceased i\r\n      stepped into bs and inquired for talbot\r\n\r\n      out said the footmantalbots own\r\n\r\n      out i replied staggering back half a dozen paceslet me tell\r\n      you my fine fellow that this thing is thoroughly impossible and\r\n      impracticable mr talbot is not out what do you mean\r\n\r\n      nothing sir only mr talbot is not in thats all he rode\r\n      over to s immediately after breakfast and left word that he\r\n      would not be in town again for a week\r\n\r\n      i stood petrified with horror and rage i endeavored to reply\r\n      but my tongue refused its office at length i turned on my heel\r\n      livid with wrath and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the\r\n      talbots to the innermost regions of erebus it was evident that\r\n      my considerate friend il fanatico had quite forgotten his\r\n      appointment with myselfhad forgotten it as soon as it was made\r\n      at no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word there was no\r\n      help for it so smothering my vexation as well as i could i\r\n      strolled moodily up the street propounding futile inquiries\r\n      about madame lalande to every male acquaintance i met by report\r\n      she was known i found to allto many by sightbut she had been\r\n      in town only a few weeks and there were very few therefore who\r\n      claimed her personal acquaintance these few being still\r\n      comparatively strangers could not or would not take the\r\n      liberty of introducing me through the formality of a morning\r\n      call while i stood thus in despair conversing with a trio of\r\n      friends upon the allabsorbing subject of my heart it so\r\n      happened that the subject itself passed by\r\n\r\n      as i live there she is cried one\r\n\r\n      surprisingly beautiful exclaimed a second\r\n\r\n      an angel upon earth ejaculated a third\r\n\r\n      i looked and in an open carriage which approached us passing\r\n      slowly down the street sat the enchanting vision of the opera\r\n      accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her\r\n      box\r\n\r\n      her companion also wears remarkably well said the one of my\r\n      trio who had spoken first\r\n\r\n      astonishingly said the second still quite a brilliant air\r\n      but art will do wonders upon my word she looks better than she\r\n      did at paris five years ago a beautiful woman stilldont you\r\n      think so froissartsimpson i mean\r\n\r\n      still said i and why shouldnt she be but compared with\r\n      her friend she is as a rushlight to the evening stara glowworm\r\n      to antares\r\n\r\n      ha ha hawhy simpson you have an astonishing tact at making\r\n      discoveriesoriginal ones i mean and here we separated while\r\n      one of the trio began humming a gay vaudeville of which i\r\n      caught only the lines\r\n\r\n      ninon ninon ninon à bas\r\n      a bas ninon de lenclos\r\n\r\n      during this little scene however one thing had served greatly\r\n      to console me although it fed the passion by which i was\r\n      consumed as the carriage of madame lalande rolled by our group\r\n      i had observed that she recognized me and more than this she\r\n      had blessed me by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles\r\n      with no equivocal mark of the recognition\r\n\r\n      as for an introduction i was obliged to abandon all hope of it\r\n      until such time as talbot should think proper to return from the\r\n      country in the meantime i perseveringly frequented every\r\n      reputable place of public amusement and at length at the\r\n      theatre where i first saw her i had the supreme bliss of\r\n      meeting her and of exchanging glances with her once again this\r\n      did not occur however until the lapse of a fortnight every\r\n      day in the interim i had inquired for talbot at his hotel and\r\n      every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the\r\n      everlasting not come home yet of his footman\r\n\r\n      upon the evening in question therefore i was in a condition\r\n      little short of madness madame lalande i had been told was a\r\n      parisianhad lately arrived from parismight she not suddenly\r\n      returnreturn before talbot came backand might she not be thus\r\n      lost to me forever the thought was too terrible to bear since\r\n      my future happiness was at issue i resolved to act with a manly\r\n      decision in a word upon the breaking up of the play i traced\r\n      the lady to her residence noted the address and the next\r\n      morning sent her a full and elaborate letter in which i poured\r\n      out my whole heart\r\n\r\n      i spoke boldly freelyin a word i spoke with passion i\r\n      concealed nothingnothing even of my weakness i alluded to the\r\n      romantic circumstances of our first meetingeven to the glances\r\n      which had passed between us i went so far as to say that i felt\r\n      assured of her love while i offered this assurance and my own\r\n      intensity of devotion as two excuses for my otherwise\r\n      unpardonable conduct as a third i spoke of my fear that she\r\n      might quit the city before i could have the opportunity of a\r\n      formal introduction i concluded the most wildly enthusiastic\r\n      epistle ever penned with a frank declaration of my worldly\r\n      circumstancesof my affluenceand with an offer of my heart and\r\n      of my hand\r\n\r\n      in an agony of expectation i awaited the reply after what seemed\r\n      the lapse of a century it came\r\n\r\n      yes actually came romantic as all this may appear i really\r\n      received a letter from madame lalandethe beautiful the wealthy\r\n      the idolized madame lalande her eyesher magnificent eyes had\r\n      not belied her noble heart like a true frenchwoman as she was\r\n      she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reasonthe generous\r\n      impulses of her naturedespising the conventional pruderies of\r\n      the world she had not scorned my proposals she had not\r\n      sheltered herself in silence she had not returned my letter\r\n      unopened she had even sent me in reply one penned by her own\r\n      exquisite fingers it ran thus\r\n\r\n      monsieur simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle\r\n      tong of his contrée so vell as might it is only de late dat i am\r\n      arrive and

that\r\n      have now escaped my memory still talbot would not return\r\n      alas could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering\r\n      his absence had occasioned his friend would not his sympathizing\r\n      nature have flown immediately to my relief still however he\r\n      came not i wrote he replied he was detained by urgent\r\n      businessbut would shortly return he begged me not to be\r\n      impatientto moderate my transportsto read soothing booksto\r\n      drink nothing stronger than hockand to bring the consolations of\r\n      philosophy to my aid the fool if he could not come himself\r\n      why in the name of every thing rational could he not have\r\n      enclosed me a letter of presentation i wrote him again\r\n      entreating him to forward one forthwith my letter was returned\r\n      by that footman with the following endorsement in pencil the\r\n      scoundrel had joined his master in the country\r\n\r\n      left s yesterday for parts unknowndid not say whereor when\r\n      be backso thought best to return letter knowing your\r\n      handwriting and as how you is always more or less in a hurry\r\n\r\n      yours sincerely\r\n\r\n      stubbs\r\n\r\n      after this it is needless to say that i devoted to the infernal\r\n      deities both master and valetbut there was little use in anger\r\n      and no consolation at all in complaint\r\n\r\n      but i had yet a resource left in my constitutional audacity\r\n      hitherto it had served me well and i now resolved to make it\r\n      avail me to the end besides after the correspondence which had\r\n      passed between us what act of mere informality could i commit\r\n      within bounds that ought to be regarded as indecorous by madame\r\n      lalande since the affair of the letter i had been in the habit\r\n      of watching her house and thus discovered that about twilight\r\n      it was her custom to promenade attended only by a negro in\r\n      livery in a public square overlooked by her windows here amid\r\n      the luxuriant and shadowing groves in the gray gloom of a sweet\r\n      midsummer evening i observed my opportunity and accosted her\r\n\r\n      the better to deceive the servant in attendance i did this with\r\n      the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance with a\r\n      presence of mind truly parisian she took the cue at once and\r\n      to greet me held out the most bewitchingly little of hands the\r\n      valet at once fell into the rear and now with hearts full to\r\n      overflowing we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love\r\n\r\n      as madame lalande spoke english even less fluently than she wrote\r\n      it our conversation was necessarily in french in this sweet\r\n      tongue so adapted to passion i gave loose to the impetuous\r\n      enthusiasm of my nature and with all the eloquence i could\r\n      command besought her to consent to an immediate marriage\r\n\r\n      at this impatience she smiled she urged the old story of\r\n      decorumthat bugbear which deters so many from bliss until the\r\n      opportunity for bliss has forever gone by i had most imprudently\r\n      made it known among my friends she observed that i desired her\r\n      acquaintancethus that i did not possess itthus again there\r\n      was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge\r\n      of each other and then she adverted with a blush to the\r\n      extreme recency of this date to wed immediately would be\r\n      improperwould be indecorouswould be outre all this she said\r\n      with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved\r\n      and convinced me she went even so far as to accuse me\r\n      laughingly of rashnessof imprudence she bade me remember that\r\n      i really even knew not who she waswhat were her prospects her\r\n      connections her standing in society she begged me but with a\r\n      sigh to reconsider my proposal and termed my love an\r\n      infatuationa will o the wispa fancy or fantasy of the momenta\r\n      baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of\r\n      the heart these things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet\r\n      twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around usand then with\r\n      a gentle pressure of her fairylike hand overthrew in a single\r\n      sweet instant all the argumentative fabric she had reared\r\n\r\n      i replied as best i couldas only a true lover can i spoke at\r\n      length and perseveringly of my devotion of my passionof her\r\n      exceeding beauty and of my own enthusiastic admiration in\r\n      conclusion i dwelt with a convincing energy upon the perils\r\n      that encompass the course of lovethat course of true love that\r\n      never did run smoothand thus deduced the manifest danger of\r\n      rendering that course unnecessarily long\r\n\r\n      this latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her\r\n      determination she relented but there was yet an obstacle she\r\n      said which she felt assured i had not properly considered this\r\n      was a delicate pointfor a woman to urge especially so in\r\n      mentioning it she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her\r\n      feelings still for me every sacrifice should be made she\r\n      alluded to the topic of age was i awarewas i fully aware of the\r\n      discrepancy between us that the age of the husband should\r\n      surpass by a few yearseven by fifteen or twentythe age of the\r\n      wife was regarded by the world as admissible and indeed as\r\n      even proper but she had always entertained the belief that the\r\n      years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the\r\n      husband a discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise too\r\n      frequently alas to a life of unhappiness now she was aware\r\n      that my own age did not exceed two and twenty and i on the\r\n      contrary perhaps was not aware that the years of my eugénie\r\n      extended very considerably beyond that sum\r\n\r\n      about all this there was a nobility of soula dignity of\r\n      candorwhich delightedwhich enchanted mewhich eternally riveted\r\n      my chains i could scarcely restrain the excessive transport\r\n      which possessed me\r\n\r\n      my sweetest eugénie i cried what is all this about which you\r\n      are discoursing your years surpass in some measure my own but\r\n      what then the customs of the world are so many conventional\r\n      follies to those who love as ourselves in what respect differs\r\n      a year from an hour i am twentytwo you say granted indeed\r\n      you may as well call me at once twentythree now you yourself\r\n      my dearest eugénie can have numbered no more thancan have\r\n      numbered no more thanno more thanthanthanthan\r\n\r\n      here i paused for an instant in the expectation that madame\r\n      lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age but a\r\n      frenchwoman is seldom direct and has always by way of answer to\r\n      an embarrassing query some little practical reply of her own in\r\n      the present instance eugénie who for a few moments past had\r\n      seemed to be searching for something in her bosom at length let\r\n      fall upon the grass a miniature which i immediately picked up\r\n      and presented to her\r\n\r\n      keep it she said with one of her most ravishing smiles keep\r\n      it for my sakefor the sake of her whom it too flatteringly\r\n      represents besides upon the back of the trinket you may\r\n      discover perhaps the very information you seem to desire it is\r\n      now to be sure growing rather darkbut you can examine it at\r\n      your leisure in the morning in the meantime you shall be my\r\n      escort home tonight my friends are about holding a little\r\n      musical levée i can promise you too some good singing we\r\n      french are not nearly so punctilious as you americans and i\r\n      shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in in the character of\r\n      an old acquaintance\r\n\r\n      with this she took my arm and i attended her home the mansion\r\n      was quite a fine one and i believe furnished in good taste of\r\n      this latter point however i am scarcely qualified to judge for\r\n      it was just dark as we arrived and in american mansions of the\r\n      better sort lights seldom during the heat of summer make their\r\n      appearance at this the most pleasant period of the day in about\r\n      an hour after my arrival to be sure a single shaded solar lamp\r\n      was lit in the principal drawingroom and this apartment i\r\n      could thus see was arranged with unusual good taste and even\r\n      splendor but two other rooms of the suite and in which the\r\n      company chiefly assembled remained during the whole evening in\r\n      a very agreeable shadow this is a wellconceived custom giving\r\n      the party at least a choice of light or shade and one which our\r\n      friends over the water could not do better than immediately\r\n      adopt\r\n\r\n      the evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of\r\n      my life madame lalande had not overrated the musical abilities\r\n      of her friends and the singing i here heard i had never heard\r\n      excelled in any private circle out of vienna the instrumental\r\n      performers were many and of superior talents the vocalists were\r\n      chiefly ladies and no individual sang less than well at length\r\n      upon a peremptory call for madame lalande she arose at once\r\n      without affectation or demur from the chaise longue upon which\r\n      she had sat by my side and accompanied by one or two gentlemen\r\n      and her female friend of the opera repaired to the piano in the\r\n      main drawingroom i would have escorted her myself but felt\r\n      that under the circumstances of my introduction to the house i\r\n      had better remain unobserved where i was i was thus deprived of\r\n      the pleasure of seeing although not of hearing her sing\r\n\r\n      the impression she produced upon the company seemed\r\n      electricalbut the effect upon myself was something even more i\r\n      know not how adequately to describe it it arose in part no\r\n      doubt from the sentiment of love with which i was imbued but\r\n      chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the\r\n      singer it is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or\r\n      recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers her\r\n      utterance of the romance in otellothe tone with which she gave\r\n      the words sul mio sasso in the capulettiis ringing in my\r\n      memory yet her lower tones were absolutely miraculous her voice\r\n      embraced three complete octaves extending from the contralto d\r\n      to the d upper soprano and though sufficiently powerful to have\r\n      filled the san carlos executed with the minutest precision\r\n      every difficulty of vocal compositionascending and descending\r\n      scales cadences or fiorituri in the final of the somnambula\r\n      she brought about a most remarkable effect at the words\r\n\r\n     ah non guinge uman pensiero\r\n     al contento ond io son piena\r\n\r\n      here in imitation of malibran she modified the original phrase\r\n      of bellini so as to let her voice descend to the tenor g when\r\n      by a rapid transition she struck the g above the treble stave\r\n      springing over an interval of two octaves\r\n\r\n      upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal\r\n      execution she resumed her seat by my side when i expressed to\r\n      her in terms of the deepest enthusiasm my delight at her\r\n      performance of my surprise i said nothing and yet was i most\r\n      unfeignedly surprised for a certain feebleness or rather a\r\n      certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation\r\n      had prepared me to anticipate that in singing she would not\r\n      acquit herself with any remarkable ability\r\n\r\n      our conversation was now long earnest uninterrupted and\r\n      totally unreserved she made me relate many of the earlier\r\n      passages of my life and listened with breathless attention to\r\n      every word of the narrative i concealed nothingfelt that i had\r\n      a right to conceal nothingfrom her confiding affection\r\n      encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age i\r\n      entered with perfect frankness not only into a detail of my\r\n      many minor vices but made full confession of those moral and\r\n      even of those physical infirmities the disclosure of which in\r\n      demanding so much higher a degree of courage is so much surer an\r\n      evidence of love i touched upon my college indiscretionsupon my\r\n      extravagancesupon my carousalsupon my debtsupon my\r\n      flirtations i even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic\r\n      cough with which at one time i had been troubledof a chronic\r\n      rheumatismof a twinge of hereditary goutand in conclusion of\r\n      the disagreeable and inconvenient but hitherto carefully\r\n      concealed weakness of my eyes\r\n\r\n      upon this latter point said madame lalande laughingly you\r\n      have been surely injudicious in coming to confession for\r\n      without the confession i take it for granted that no one would\r\n      have accused you of the crime by the by she continued have\r\n      you any recollection and here i fancied that a blush even\r\n      through the gloom of the apartment became distinctly visible\r\n      upon her cheekhave you any recollection mon cher ami of\r\n      this little ocular assistant which now depends from my neck\r\n\r\n      as she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double\r\n      eyeglass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the\r\n      opera\r\n\r\n      full wellalas do i remember it i exclaimed pressing\r\n      passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my\r\n      inspection they formed a complex and magnificent toy richly\r\n      chased and filigreed and gleaming with jewels which even in\r\n      the deficient light i could not help perceiving were of high\r\n      value\r\n\r\n      eh bien mon ami she resumed with a certain empressment of\r\n      manner that rather surprised meeh bien mon ami you have\r\n      earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to\r\n      denominate priceless you have demanded of me my hand upon the\r\n      morrow should i yield to your entreatiesand i may add to the\r\n      pleadings of my own bosomwould i not be entitled to demand of\r\n      you a verya very little boon in return\r\n\r\n      name it i exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon\r\n      us the observation of the company and restrained by their\r\n      presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet\r\n      name it my beloved my eugénie my ownname itbut alas it\r\n      is already yielded ere named\r\n\r\n      you shall conquer then mon ami said she for the sake of\r\n      the eugénie whom you love this little weakness which you have at\r\n      last confessedthis weakness more moral than physicaland which\r\n      let me assure you is so unbecoming the nobility of your real\r\n      natureso inconsistent with the candor of your usual\r\n      characterand which if permitted further control will assuredly\r\n      involve you sooner or later in some very disagreeable scrape\r\n      you shall conquer for my sake this affectation which leads you\r\n      as you yourself acknowledge to the tacit or implied denial of\r\n      your infirmity of vision for this infirmity you virtually deny\r\n      in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief you\r\n      will understand me to say then that i wish you to wear\r\n      spectaclesah hushyou have already consented to wear them\r\n      for my sake you shall accept the little toy which i now hold in\r\n      my hand and which though admirable as an aid to vision is\r\n      really of no very immense value as a gem you perceive that by a\r\n      trifling modification thusor thusit can be adapted to the eyes\r\n      in the form of spectacles or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an\r\n      eyeglass it is in the former mode however and habitually\r\n      that you have already consented to wear it for my sake\r\n\r\n      this requestmust i confess itconfused me in no little degree\r\n      but the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation\r\n      of course a matter altogether out of the question\r\n\r\n      it is done i cried with all the enthusiasm that i could\r\n      muster at the moment it is doneit is most cheerfully agreed i\r\n      sacrifice every feeling for your sake tonight i wear this dear\r\n      eyeglass as an eyeglass and upon my heart but with the\r\n      earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of\r\n      calling you wife i will place it upon myupon my noseand there\r\n      wear it ever afterward in the less romantic and less\r\n      fashionable but certainly in the more serviceable form which\r\n      you desire\r\n\r\n      our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements\r\n      for the morrow talbot i learned from my betrothed had just\r\n      arrived in town i was to see him at once and procure a\r\n      carriage the soirée would scarcely break up before two and by\r\n      this hour the vehicle was to be at the door when in the\r\n      confusion occasioned by the departure of the company madame l\r\n      could easily enter it unobserved we were then to call at the\r\n      house of a clergyman who would be in waiting there be married\r\n      drop talbot and proceed on a short tour to the east leaving the\r\n      fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the\r\n      matter it thought best\r\n\r\n      having planned all this i immediately took leave and went in\r\n      search of talbot but on the way i could not refrain from\r\n      stepping into a hotel for the purpose of inspecting the\r\n      miniature and this i did by the powerful aid of the glasses the\r\n      countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one those large\r\n      luminous eyesthat proud grecian nosethose dark luxuriant\r\n      curlsah said i exultingly to myself this is indeed the\r\n      speaking image of my beloved i turned the reverse and\r\n      discovered the wordseugénie lalandeaged twentyseven years and\r\n      seven months\r\n\r\n      i found talbot at home and proceeded at once to acquaint him\r\n      with my good fortune he professed excessive astonishment of\r\n      course but congratulated me most cordially and proffered every\r\n      assistance in his power in a word we carried out our\r\n      arrangement to the letter and at two in the morning just ten\r\n      minutes after the ceremony i found myself in a close carriage\r\n      with madame lalandewith mrs simpson i should sayand driving\r\n      at a great rate out of town in a direction northeast by north\r\n      halfnorth\r\n\r\n      it had been determined for us by talbot that as we were to be\r\n      up all night we should make our first stop at c a village\r\n      about twenty miles from the city and there get an early\r\n      breakfast and some repose before proceeding upon our route at\r\n      four precisely therefore the carriage drew up at the door of\r\n      the principal inn i handed my adored wife out and ordered\r\n      breakfast forthwith in the meantime we were shown into a small\r\n      parlor and sat down\r\n\r\n      it was now nearly if not altogether daylight and as i gazed\r\n      enraptured at the angel by my side the singular idea came all\r\n      at once into my head that this was really the very first moment\r\n      since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of madame\r\n      lalande that i had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness\r\n      by daylight at all\r\n\r\n      and now mon ami said she taking my hand and so\r\n      interrupting this train of reflection and now mon cher ami\r\n      since we are indissolubly onesince i have yielded to your\r\n      passionate entreaties and performed my portion of our\r\n      agreementi presume you have not forgotten that you also have a\r\n      little favor to bestowa little promise which it is your\r\n      intention to keep ah let me see let me remember yes full\r\n      easily do i call to mind the precise words of the dear promise\r\n      you made to eugénie last night listen you spoke thus it is\r\n      doneit is most cheerfully agreed i sacrifice every feeling for\r\n      your sake tonight i wear this dear eyeglass as an eyeglass\r\n      and upon my heart but with the earliest dawn of that morning\r\n      which gives me the privilege of calling you wife i will place it\r\n      upon myupon my noseand there wear it ever afterward in the\r\n      less romantic and less fashionable but certainly in the more\r\n      serviceable form which you desire these were the exact words\r\n      my beloved husband were they not\r\n\r\n      they were i said you have an excellent memory and\r\n      assuredly my beautiful eugénie there is no disposition on my\r\n      part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply\r\n      see behold they are becomingratherare they not and here\r\n      having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles i\r\n      applied them gingerly in their proper position while madame\r\n      simpson adjusting her cap and folding her arms sat bolt\r\n      upright in her chair in a somewhat stiff and prim and indeed\r\n      in a somewhat undignified position\r\n\r\n      goodness gracious me i exclaimed almost at the very instant\r\n      that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nosemy\r\n      goodness gracious mewhy what can be the matter with these\r\n      glasses and taking them quickly off i wiped them carefully\r\n      with a silk handkerchief and adjusted them again\r\n\r\n      but if in the first instance there had occurred something which\r\n      occasioned me surprise in the second this surprise became\r\n      elevated into astonishment and this astonishment was\r\n      profoundwas extremeindeed i may say it was horrific what in\r\n      the name of everything hideous did this mean could i believe my\r\n      eyescould ithat was the question was thatwas thatwas that\r\n      rouge and were thoseand were thosewere those wrinkles upon\r\n      the visage of eugénie lalande and oh jupiter and every one of\r\n      the gods and goddesses little and bigwhatwhatwhatwhat had\r\n      become of her teeth i dashed the spectacles violently to the\r\n      ground and leaping to my feet stood erect in the middle of the\r\n      floor confronting mrs simpson with my arms set akimbo and\r\n      grinning and foaming but at the same time utterly speechless\r\n      with terror and with rage\r\n\r\n      now i have already said that madame eugénie lalandethat is to\r\n      say simpsonspoke the english language but very little better\r\n      than she wrote it and for this reason she very properly never\r\n      attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions but rage will\r\n      carry a lady to any extreme and in the present care it carried\r\n      mrs simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to\r\n      hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether\r\n      understand\r\n\r\n      vell monsieur said she after surveying me in great apparent\r\n      astonishment for some momentsvell monsieurand

the effect of\r\n      working up mrs simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed\r\n      and as she made an end of it with great labor she jumped up\r\n      from her chair like somebody bewitched dropping upon the floor\r\n      an entire universe of bustle as she jumped once upon her feet\r\n      she gnashed her gums brandished her arms rolled up her sleeves\r\n      shook her fist in my face and concluded the performance by\r\n      tearing the cap from her head and with it an immense wig of the\r\n      most valuable and beautiful black hair the whole of which she\r\n      dashed upon the ground with a yell and there trammpled and\r\n      danced a fandango upon it in an absolute ecstasy and agony of\r\n      rage\r\n\r\n      meantime i sank aghast into the chair which

in\r\n      sober fact my great great grandmother in her youth she had\r\n      been beautiful and even at eightytwo retained the majestic\r\n      height the sculptural contour of head the fine eyes and the\r\n      grecian nose of her girlhood by the aid of these of\r\n      pearlpowder of rouge of false hair false teeth and false\r\n      tournure as well as of the most skilful modistes of paris she\r\n      contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en\r\n      peu passées of the french metropolis in this respect indeed\r\n      she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the\r\n      celebrated ninon de lenclos\r\n\r\n      she was immensely wealthy and being left for the second time a\r\n      widow without children she bethought herself of my existence in\r\n      america and for the purpose of making me her heir paid a visit\r\n      to the united states in company with a distant and exceedingly\r\n      lovely relative of her second husbandsa madame stéphanie\r\n      lalande\r\n\r\n      at the opera my great great grandmothers attention was\r\n      arrested by my notice and upon surveying me through her\r\n      eyeglass she was struck with a certain family resemblance to\r\n      herself thus interested and knowing that the heir she sought\r\n      was actually in the city she made inquiries of her party\r\n      respecting me the gentleman who attended her knew my person and\r\n      told her who i was the information thus obtained induced her to\r\n      renew her scrutiny and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened\r\n      me that i behaved in the absurd manner already detailed she\r\n      returned my bow however under the impression that by some odd\r\n      accident i had discovered her identity when deceived by my\r\n      weakness of vision and the arts of the toilet in respect to the\r\n      age and charms of the strange lady i demanded so\r\n      enthusiastically of talbot who she was he concluded that i meant\r\n      the younger beauty as a matter of course and so informed me\r\n      with perfect truth that she was the celebrated widow madame\r\n      lalande\r\n\r\n      in the street next morning my great great grandmother\r\n      encountered talbot an old parisian acquaintance and the\r\n      conversation very naturally turned upon myself my deficiencies\r\n      of vision were then explained for these were notorious although\r\n      i was entirely ignorant of their notoriety and my good old\r\n      relative discovered much to her chagrin that she had been\r\n      deceived in supposing me aware of her identity and that i had\r\n      been merely making a fool of myself in making open love in a\r\n      theatre to an old woman unknown by way of punishing me for this\r\n      imprudence she concocted with talbot a plot he purposely kept\r\n      out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction my street\r\n      inquiries about the lovely widow madame lalande were supposed\r\n      to refer to the younger lady of course and thus the\r\n      conversation with the three gentlemen whom i encountered shortly\r\n      after leaving talbots hotel will be easily explained as also\r\n      their allusion to ninon de lenclos i had no opportunity of\r\n      seeing madame lalande closely during daylight and at her\r\n      musical soirée my silly weakness in refusing the aid of\r\n      glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her\r\n      age when madame lalande was called upon to sing the younger\r\n      lady was intended and it was she who arose to obey the call my\r\n      great great grandmother to further the deception arising at\r\n      the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main\r\n      drawingroom had i decided upon escorting her thither it had\r\n      been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where i\r\n      was but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary the\r\n      songs which i so much admired and which so confirmed my\r\n      impression of the youth of my mistress were executed by madame\r\n      stéphanie lalande the eyeglass was presented by way of adding a\r\n      reproof to the hoaxa sting to the epigram of the deception its\r\n      presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon\r\n      affectation with which i was so especially edified it is almost\r\n      superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument as worn by\r\n      the old lady had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted\r\n      to my years they suited me in fact to a t\r\n\r\n      the clergyman who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot was a\r\n      boon companion of talbots and no priest he was an excellent\r\n      whip however and having doffed his cassock to put on a\r\n      greatcoat he drove the hack which conveyed the happy couple\r\n      out of town talbot took a seat at his side the two scoundrels\r\n      were thus in at the death and through a halfopen window of\r\n      the back parlor of the inn amused themselves in grinning at the\r\n      dénouement of the drama i believe i shall be forced to call\r\n      them both out\r\n\r\n      nevertheless i am not the husband of my great great\r\n      grandmother and this is a reflection which affords me infinite\r\n      reliefbut i am the husband of madame lalandeof madame\r\n      stéphanie lalandewith whom my good old relative besides making\r\n      me her sole heir when she diesif she ever doeshas been at the\r\n      trouble of concocting me a

night in the month of october and\r\n      during the chivalrous reign of the third edward two seamen\r\n      belonging to the crew of the >free and easy a trading schooner\r\n      plying between sluys and the thames and then at anchor in that\r\n      river were much astonished to find themselves seated in the\r\n      taproom of an alehouse in the parish of st andrews\r\n      londonwhich alehouse bore for sign the portraiture of a jolly\r\n      tar\r\n\r\n      the room although illcontrived smokeblackened lowpitched\r\n      and in every other respect agreeing with the general character of\r\n      such places at the periodwas nevertheless in the opinion of\r\n      the grotesque groups scattered here and there within it\r\n      sufficiently well adapted to its purpose\r\n\r\n      of these groups our two seamen formed i think the most\r\n      interesting if not the most conspicuous\r\n\r\n      the one who appeared to be the elder and whom his companion\r\n      addressed by the characteristic appellation of legs was at the\r\n      same time much the taller of the two he might have measured six\r\n      feet and a half and an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to\r\n      have been the necessary consequence of an altitude so enormous\r\n      superfluities in height were however more than accounted for by\r\n      deficiencies in other respects he was exceedingly thin and\r\n      might as his associates asserted have answered when drunk for\r\n      a pennant at the masthead or when sober have served for a\r\n      jibboom but these jests and others of a similar nature had\r\n      evidently produced at no time any effect upon the cachinnatory\r\n      muscles of the tar with high cheekbones a large hawknose\r\n      retreating chin fallen underjaw and huge protruding white\r\n      eyes the expression of his countenance although tinged with a\r\n      species of dogged indifference to matters and things in general\r\n      was not the less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts\r\n      at imitation or description\r\n\r\n      the younger seaman was in all outward appearance the converse\r\n      of his companion his stature could not have exceeded four feet\r\n      a pair of stumpy bowlegs supported his squat unwieldy figure\r\n      while his unusually short and thick arms with no ordinary fists\r\n      at their extremities swung off dangling from his sides like the\r\n      fins of a seaturtle small eyes of no particular color\r\n      twinkled far back in his head his nose remained buried in the\r\n      mass of flesh which enveloped his round full and purple face\r\n      and his thick upperlip rested upon the still thicker one beneath\r\n      with an air of complacent selfsatisfaction much heightened by\r\n      the owners habit of licking them at intervals he evidently\r\n      regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling halfwondrous\r\n      halfquizzical and stared up occasionally in his face as the red\r\n      setting sun stares up at the crags of ben nevis\r\n\r\n      various and eventful however had been the peregrinations of the\r\n      worthy couple in and about the different taphouses of the\r\n      neighbourhood during the earlier hours of the night funds even\r\n      the most ample are not always everlasting and it was with empty\r\n      pockets our friends had ventured upon the present hostelrie\r\n\r\n      at the precise period then when this history properly\r\n      commences legs and his fellow hugh tarpaulin sat each with\r\n      both elbows resting upon the large oaken table in the middle of\r\n      the floor and with a hand upon either cheek they were eyeing\r\n      from behind a huge flagon of unpaidfor hummingstuff the\r\n      portentous words no chalk which to their indignation and\r\n      astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of that very\r\n      mineral whose presence they

indescribable\r\n      leelurch about the wholewhich foreboded in the opinion of both\r\n      seamen a long run of dirty weather and determined them at once\r\n      in the allegorical words of legs himself to pump ship clew up\r\n      all sail and scud before the wind\r\n\r\n      having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale and\r\n      looped up the points of their short doublets they finally made a\r\n      bolt for the street although tarpaulin rolled twice into the\r\n      fireplace mistaking it for the door yet their escape was at\r\n      length happily effectedand half after twelve oclock found our\r\n      heroes ripe for mischief and running for life down a dark alley\r\n      in the direction of st andrews stair hotly pursued by the\r\n      landlady of the jolly tar\r\n\r\n      at the epoch of this eventful tale and periodically for many\r\n      years before and after all england but more especially the\r\n      metropolis resounded with the fearful cry of plague the city\r\n      was in a great measure depopulatedand in those horrible regions\r\n      in the vicinity of the thames where amid the dark narrow and\r\n      filthy lanes and alleys the demon of disease was supposed to\r\n      have had his nativity awe terror and superstition were alone\r\n      to be found stalking abroad\r\n\r\n      by authority of the king such districts were placed under ban\r\n      and all persons forbidden under pain of death to intrude upon\r\n      their dismal solitude yet neither the mandate of the monarch\r\n      nor the huge barriers erected at the entrances of the streets\r\n      nor the prospect of that loathsome death which with almost\r\n      absolute certainty overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could\r\n      deter from the adventure prevented the unfurnished and\r\n      untenanted dwellings from being stripped by the hand of nightly\r\n      rapine of every article such as iron brass or leadwork\r\n      which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account\r\n\r\n      above all it was usually found upon the annual winter opening\r\n      of the barriers that locks bolts and secret cellars had\r\n      proved but slender protection to those rich stores of wines and\r\n      liquors which in consideration of the risk and trouble of\r\n      removal many of the numerous dealers having shops in the\r\n      neighbourhood had consented to trust during the period of exile\r\n      to so insufficient a security\r\n\r\n      but there were very few of the terrorstricken people who\r\n      attributed these doings to the agency of human hands\r\n      pestspirits plaguegoblins and feverdemons were the popular\r\n      imps of mischief and tales so bloodchilling were hourly told\r\n      that the whole mass of forbidden buildings was at length\r\n      enveloped in terror as in a shroud and the plunderer himself was\r\n      often scared away by the horrors his own depreciations had\r\n      created leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited district\r\n      to gloom silence pestilence and death\r\n\r\n      it was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned and\r\n      which indicated the region beyond to be under the pestban that\r\n      in scrambling down an alley legs and the worthy hugh tarpaulin\r\n      found their progress suddenly impeded to return was out of the\r\n      question and no time was to be lost as their pursuers were\r\n      close upon their heels with thoroughbred seamen to clamber up\r\n      the roughly fashioned plankwork was a trifle and maddened with\r\n      the twofold excitement of exercise and liquor they leaped\r\n      unhesitatingly down within the enclosure and holding on their\r\n      drunken course with shouts and yellings were soon bewildered in\r\n      its noisome and intricate recesses\r\n\r\n      had they not indeed been intoxicated beyond moral sense their\r\n      reeling footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their\r\n      situation the air was cold and misty the pavingstones\r\n      loosened from their beds lay in wild disorder amid the tall\r\n      rank grass which sprang up around the feet and ankles fallen\r\n      houses choked up the streets the most fetid and poisonous smells\r\n      everywhere prevailedand by the aid of that ghastly light which\r\n      even at midnight never fails to emanate from a vapory and\r\n      pestilential atmosphere might be discerned lying in the bypaths\r\n      and alleys or rotting in the windowless habitations the carcass\r\n      of many a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague\r\n      in the very perpetration of his robbery\r\n\r\n      but it lay not in the power of images or sensations or\r\n      impediments such as these to stay the course of men who\r\n      naturally brave and at that time especially brimful of courage\r\n      and of hummingstuff would have reeled as straight as their\r\n      condition might have permitted undauntedly into the very jaws of\r\n      death onwardstill onward stalked the grim legs making the\r\n      desolate solemnity echo and reecho with yells like the terrific\r\n      warwhoop of the indian and onward still onward rolled the\r\n      dumpy tarpaulin hanging on to the doublet of his more active\r\n      companion and far surpassing the latters most strenuous\r\n      exertions in the way of vocal music by bullroarings in basso\r\n      from the profundity of his stentorian lungs\r\n\r\n      they had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence\r\n      their way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more\r\n      horriblethe paths more narrow and more intricate huge stones\r\n      and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them\r\n      gave evidence by their sullen and heavy descent of the vast\r\n      height of the surrounding houses and while actual exertion\r\n      became necessary to force a passage through frequent heaps of\r\n      rubbish it was by no means seldom that the hand fell upon a\r\n      skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse\r\n\r\n      suddenly as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall\r\n      and ghastlylooking building a yell more than usually shrill\r\n      from the throat of the excited legs was replied to from within\r\n      in a rapid succession of wild laughterlike and fiendish\r\n      shrieks nothing daunted at sounds which of such a nature at\r\n      such a time and in such a place might have curdled the very\r\n      blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire the drunken couple\r\n      rushed headlong against the door burst it open and staggered\r\n      into the midst of things with a volley of curses\r\n\r\n      the room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop\r\n      of an undertaker but an open trapdoor in a corner of the floor\r\n      near the entrance looked down upon a long range of winecellars\r\n      whose depths the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed\r\n      to be well stored with their appropriate contents in the middle\r\n      of the room stood a tablein the centre of which again arose a\r\n      huge tub of what appeared to be punch bottles of various wines\r\n      and cordials together with jugs pitchers and flagons of every\r\n      shape and quality were scattered profusely upon the board\r\n      around it upon coffintressels was seated a company of six\r\n      this company i will endeavor to delineate one by one\r\n\r\n      fronting the entrance and elevated a little above his\r\n      companions sat a personage who appeared to be the president of\r\n      the table his stature was gaunt and tall and legs was\r\n      confounded to behold in him a figure more emaciated than himself\r\n      his face was as yellow as saffronbut no feature excepting one\r\n      alone was sufficiently marked to merit a particular description\r\n      this one consisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously\r\n      lofty as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh\r\n      superadded upon the natural head his mouth was puckered and\r\n      dimpled into an expression of ghastly affability and his eyes\r\n      as indeed the eyes of all at table were glazed over with the\r\n      fumes of intoxication this gentleman was clothed from head to\r\n      foot in a richlyembroidered black silkvelvet pall wrapped\r\n      negligently around his form after the fashion of a spanish cloak\r\n      his head was stuck full of sable hearseplumes which he nodded\r\n      to and fro with a jaunty and knowing air and in his right hand\r\n      he held a huge human thighbone with which he appeared to have\r\n      been just knocking down some member of the company for a song\r\n\r\n      opposite him and with her back to the door was a lady of no\r\n      whit the less extraordinary character although quite as tall as\r\n      the person just described she had no right to complain of his\r\n      unnatural emaciation she was evidently in the last stage of a\r\n      dropsy and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon\r\n      of october beer which stood with the head driven in close by\r\n      her side in a corner of the chamber her face was exceedingly\r\n      round red and full and the same peculiarity or rather want of\r\n      peculiarity attached itself to her countenance which i before\r\n      mentioned in the case of the presidentthat is to say only one\r\n      feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a\r\n      separate characterization indeed the acute tarpaulin immediately\r\n      observed that the same remark might have applied to each\r\n      individual person of the party every one of whom seemed to\r\n      possess a monopoly of some particular portion of physiognomy\r\n      with the lady in question this portion proved to be the mouth\r\n      commencing at the right ear it swept with a terrific chasm to\r\n      the leftthe short pendants which she wore in either auricle\r\n      continually bobbing into the aperture she made however every\r\n      exertion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified in a dress\r\n      consisting of a newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close\r\n      under her chin with a crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin\r\n\r\n      at her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared\r\n      to patronise this delicate little creature in the trembling of\r\n      her wasted fingers in the livid hue of her lips and in the\r\n      slight hectic spot which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion\r\n      gave evident indications of a galloping consumption an air of\r\n      extreme haut ton however

soft smile played about her mouth but her nose\r\n      extremely long thin sinuous flexible and pimpled hung down\r\n      far below her under lip and in spite of the delicate manner in\r\n      which she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her\r\n      tongue gave to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression\r\n\r\n      over against her and upon the left of the dropsical lady was\r\n      seated a little puffy wheezing and gouty old man whose cheeks\r\n      reposed upon the shoulders of their owner like two huge bladders\r\n      of oporto wine with his arms folded and with one bandaged leg\r\n      deposited upon the table he seemed to think himself entitled to\r\n      some consideration he evidently prided himself much upon every\r\n      inch of his personal appearance but took more especial delight\r\n      in calling attention to his gaudycolored surtout this to say\r\n      the truth must have cost him no little money and was made to\r\n      fit him exceedingly wellbeing fashioned from one of the\r\n      curiously embroidered silken covers appertaining to those\r\n      glorious escutcheons which in england and elsewhere are\r\n      customarily hung up in some conspicuous place upon the\r\n      dwellings of departed aristocracy\r\n\r\n      next to him and at the right hand of the president was a\r\n      gentleman in long white hose and cotton drawers his frame shook\r\n      in a ridiculous manner with a fit of what tarpaulin called the\r\n      horrors his jaws which had been newly shaved were tightly\r\n      tied up by a bandage of muslin and his arms being fastened in a\r\n      similar way at the wrists prevented him from helping himself too\r\n      freely to the liquors upon the table a precaution rendered\r\n      necessary in the opinion of legs by the peculiarly sottish and\r\n      winebibbing cast of his visage a pair of prodigious ears\r\n      nevertheless which it was no doubt found impossible to confine\r\n      towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment and were\r\n      occasionally pricked up in a spasm at the sound of the drawing\r\n      of a cork\r\n\r\n      fronting him sixthly and lastly was situated a singularly\r\n      stifflooking personage who being afflicted with paralysis\r\n      must to speak seriously have felt very ill at ease in his\r\n      unaccommodating habiliments he was habited somewhat uniquely\r\n      in a new and handsome mahogany coffin its top or headpiece\r\n      pressed upon the skull of the wearer and extended over it in the\r\n      fashion of a hood giving to the entire face an air of\r\n      indescribable interest armholes had been cut in the sides for\r\n      the sake not more of elegance than of convenience but the dress\r\n      nevertheless prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as\r\n      his associates and as he lay reclining against his tressel at\r\n      an angle of fortyfive degrees a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled\r\n      up their awful whites towards the ceiling in absolute amazement\r\n      at their own enormity\r\n\r\n      before each of the party lay a portion of a skull which was used\r\n      as a drinking cup overhead was suspended a human skeleton by\r\n      means of a rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring\r\n      in the ceiling the other limb confined by no such fetter stuck\r\n      off from the body at right angles causing the whole loose and\r\n      rattling frame to dangle and twirl about at the caprice of every\r\n      occasional puff of wind which found its way into the apartment\r\n      in the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited\r\n      charcoal which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire\r\n      scene while coffins and other wares appertaining to the shop of\r\n      an undertaker were piled high up around the room and against\r\n      the windows preventing any ray from escaping into the street\r\n\r\n      at sight of this extraordinary assembly and of their still more\r\n      extraordinary paraphernalia our two seamen did not conduct\r\n      themselves with that degree of decorum which might have been\r\n      expected legs leaning against the wall near which he happened\r\n      to be standing dropped his lower jaw still lower than usual and\r\n      spread open his eyes to their fullest extent while hugh\r\n      tarpaulin stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a level\r\n      with the table and spreading out a palm upon either knee burst\r\n      into a long loud and obstreperous roar of very illtimed and\r\n      immoderate laughter\r\n\r\n      without however taking offence at behaviour so excessively\r\n      rude the tall president smiled very graciously upon the\r\n      intrudersnodded to them in a dignified manner with his head of\r\n      sable plumesand arising took each by an arm and led him to a\r\n      seat which some others of the company had placed in the meantime\r\n      for his accommodation legs to all this offered not the slightest\r\n      resistance but sat down as he was directed while the gallant\r\n      hugh removing his coffin tressel from its station near the head\r\n      of the table to the vicinity of the little consumptive lady in\r\n      the winding sheet plumped down by her side in high glee and\r\n      pouring out a skull of red wine quaffed it to their better\r\n      acquaintance but at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the\r\n      coffin seemed exceedingly nettled and serious consequences might\r\n      have ensued had not the president rapping upon the table with\r\n      his truncheon diverted the attention of all present to the\r\n      following speech\r\n\r\n      it becomes our duty upon the

   valiant legs slammed the door down upon him with an oath and\r\n      strode towards the centre of the room here tearing down the\r\n      skeleton which swung over the table he laid it about him with so\r\n      much energy and good will that as the last glimpses of light\r\n      died away within the apartment he succeeded in knocking out the\r\n      brains of the little gentleman with the gout rushing then with\r\n      all his force against the fatal hogshead full of october ale and\r\n      hugh tarpaulin he rolled it over and over in an instant out\r\n      burst a deluge of liquor

 do\r\n\r\n      the old porpoise as i opened the drawingroom door was sitting\r\n      with his feet upon the mantelpiece and a bumper of port in his\r\n      paw making strenuous efforts to

for\r\n      it you know meim a man of my wordnow be off here he\r\n      swallowed his bumper of port while i rushed from the room in\r\n      despair\r\n\r\n      a very fine old english gentleman was my granduncle\r\n      rumgudgeon but unlike him of the song he had his weak points\r\n      he was a little pursy pompous passionate semicircular\r\n      somebody with a red nose a thick skull a long purse and a\r\n      strong sense of his own consequence with the best heart in the\r\n      world he contrived through a predominant whim of contradiction\r\n      to earn for himself among those who only knew him superficially\r\n      the character of a curmudgeon like many excellent people he\r\n      seemed possessed with a spirit of tantalization which might\r\n      easily at a casual glance have been mistaken for malevolence\r\n      to every request a positive no was his immediate answer but\r\n      in the endin the long long endthere were exceedingly few\r\n      requests which he refused against all attacks upon his purse he\r\n      made the most sturdy defence but the amount extorted from him\r\n      at last was generally in direct ratio with the length of the\r\n      siege and the stubbornness of the resistance in charity no one\r\n      gave more liberally or with a worse grace\r\n\r\n      for the fine arts and especially for the belleslettres he\r\n      entertained a profound contempt with this he had been inspired\r\n      by casimir perier whose pert little query a quoi un poete est\r\n      il bon he was in the habit of quoting with a very droll\r\n      pronunciation as the ne plus ultra of logical wit thus my own\r\n      inkling for the muses had excited his entire displeasure he\r\n      assured me one day when i asked him for a new copy of horace\r\n      that the translation of poeta nascitur non fit was a nasty\r\n      poet for nothing fita remark which i took in high dudgeon his\r\n      repugnance to the humanities had also much increased of late\r\n      by an accidental bias in favor of what he supposed to be natural\r\n      science somebody had accosted him in the street mistaking him\r\n      for no less a personage than doctor dubble l dee the lecturer\r\n      upon quack physics this set him off at a tangent and just at\r\n      the epoch of this storyfor story it is getting to be after\r\n      allmy granduncle rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only\r\n      upon points which happened to chime in with the caprioles of the\r\n      hobby he was riding for the rest he laughed with his arms and\r\n      legs and his politics were stubborn and easily understood he\r\n      thought with horsley that the people have nothing to do with\r\n      the laws but to obey them\r\n\r\n      i had lived with the old gentleman all my life my parents in\r\n      dying had bequeathed me to him as a rich legacy i believe the\r\n      old villain loved me as his own childnearly if not quite as well\r\n      as he loved katebut it was a dogs existence that he led me\r\n      after all from my first year until my fifth he obliged me with\r\n      very regular floggings from five to fifteen he threatened me\r\n      hourly with the house of correction from fifteen to twenty not\r\n      a day passed in which he did not promise to cut me off with a\r\n      shilling i was a sad dog it is truebut then it was a part of\r\n      my naturea point of my faith in kate however i had a firm\r\n      friend and i knew it she was a good girl and told me very\r\n      sweetly that i might have her plum and all whenever i could\r\n      badger my granduncle rumgudgeon into the necessary consent\r\n      poor girlshe was barely fifteen and without this consent her\r\n      little amount in the funds was not comeatable until five\r\n      immeasurable summers had dragged their slow length along what\r\n      then to do at fifteen or even at twentyone for i had now\r\n      passed my fifth olympiad five years in prospect are very much\r\n      the same as five hundred in vain we besieged the old gentleman\r\n      with importunities here was a piece de resistance as messieurs\r\n      ude and careme would say which suited his perverse fancy to a t\r\n      it would have stiffed the indignation of job himself to see how\r\n      much like an old mouser he behaved to us two poor wretched little\r\n      mice in his heart he wished for nothing more ardently than our\r\n      union he had made up his mind to this all along in fact he\r\n      would have given ten thousand pounds from his own pocket kates\r\n      plum was her own if he could have invented any thing like an\r\n      excuse for complying with our very natural wishes but then we\r\n      had been so imprudent as to broach the subject ourselves not to\r\n      oppose it under such circumstances i sincerely believe was not\r\n      in his power\r\n\r\n      i have said already that he had his weak points but in speaking\r\n      of these i must not be understood as referring to his obstinacy\r\n      which was one of his strong pointsassurement ce n etait pas sa\r\n      foible when i mention his weakness i have allusion to a bizarre\r\n      oldwomanish superstition which beset him he was great in\r\n      dreams portents et id genus omne of rigmarole he was\r\n      excessively punctilious too upon small points of honor and\r\n      after his own fashion was a man of his word beyond doubt this\r\n      was in fact one of his hobbies the spirit of his vows he made\r\n      no scruple of setting at naught but the letter was a bond\r\n      inviolable now it was this latter peculiarity in his\r\n      disposition of which kates ingenuity enabled us one fine day\r\n      not long after our interview in the diningroom to take a very\r\n      unexpected advantage and having thus in the fashion of all\r\n      modern bards and orators exhausted in prolegomena all the time\r\n      at my command and nearly all the room at my disposal i will sum\r\n      up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of the story\r\n\r\n      it happened thenso the fates ordered itthat among the naval\r\n      acquaintances of my betrothed were two gentlemen who had just\r\n      set foot upon the shores of england after a years absence\r\n      each in foreign travel in company with these gentlemen my\r\n      cousin and i preconcertedly paid uncle rumgudgeon a visit on the\r\n      afternoon of sunday october the tenthjust three weeks after\r\n      the memorable decision which had so cruelly defeated our hopes\r\n      for about half an hour the conversation ran upon ordinary topics\r\n      but at last we contrived quite naturally to give it the\r\n      following turn\r\n\r\n      capt pratt well i have been absent just one yearjust one\r\n      year today as i livelet me see yesthis is october the\r\n      tenth you remember mr rumgudgeon i called this day year to\r\n      bid you goodbye and by the way it does seem something like a\r\n      coincidence does it notthat our friend captain smitherton\r\n      here has been absent exactly a year alsoa year today\r\n\r\n      smitherton yes just one year to a fraction you will remember\r\n      mr rumgudgeon that i called with capt pratol on this very day\r\n      last year to pay my parting respects\r\n\r\n      uncle yes yes yesi remember it very wellvery queer indeed\r\n      both of you gone just one year a very strange coincidence\r\n      indeed just what doctor dubble l dee would denominate an\r\n      extraordinary concurrence of events doctor dub\r\n\r\n      kate interrupting to be sure papa it is something strange\r\n      but then captain pratt and captain smitherton didnt go\r\n      altogether the same route and that makes a difference you\r\n      know\r\n\r\n      uncle i dont know any such thing you huzzy how should i i\r\n      think it only makes the matter more remarkable doctor dubble l\r\n      dee\r\n\r\n      kate why papa captain pratt went round cape horn and captain\r\n      smitherton doubled the cape of good hope\r\n\r\n      uncle preciselythe one went east and the other went west you\r\n      jade and they both have gone quite round the world by the by\r\n      doctor dubble l dee\r\n\r\n      myself hurriedly captain pratt you must come and spend the\r\n      evening with us tomorrowyou and smithertonyou can tell us all\r\n      about your voyage and well have a game of whist and\r\n\r\n      pratt wist my dear fellowyou forget tomorrow will be\r\n      sunday some other evening\r\n\r\n      kate oh no fieroberts not quite so bad as that todays\r\n      sunday\r\n\r\n      pratt i beg both your pardonsbut i cant be so much mistaken\r\n      i know tomorrows sunday because\r\n\r\n      smitherton much surprised what are you all thinking about\r\n      wasnt yesterday sunday i should like to know\r\n\r\n      all yesterday indeed you are out\r\n\r\n      uncle todays sunday i saydont i know\r\n\r\n      pratt oh notomorrows sunday\r\n\r\n      smitherton you are all madevery one of you i am as positive\r\n      that yesterday was sunday as i am that i sit upon this chair\r\n\r\n      kate jumping up eagerly i see iti see it all papa this is\r\n      a judgment upon you aboutabout you know what let me alone and\r\n      ill explain it all in a minute its a very simple thing\r\n      indeed captain smitherton says that yesterday was sunday so it\r\n      was he is right cousin bobby and uncle and i say that today\r\n      is sunday so it is we are right captain pratt maintains that\r\n      tomorrow will be sunday so it will he is right too the fact\r\n      is we are all right and thus three sundays have come together\r\n      in a week\r\n\r\n      smitherton after a pause by the by pratt kate has us\r\n      completely what fools we two are mr rumgudgeon the matter\r\n      stands thus the earth you know is twentyfour thousand miles\r\n      in circumference now this globe of the earth turns upon its own\r\n      axisrevolvesspins roundthese twentyfour thousand miles of\r\n      extent going from west to east in precisely twentyfour hours\r\n      do you understand mr rumgudgeon\r\n\r\n      uncle to be sureto be suredoctor dub\r\n\r\n      smitherton drowning his voice well sir that is at the rate\r\n      of one thousand miles per hour now suppose that i sail from\r\n      this position a thousand miles east of course i anticipate the\r\n      rising of the sun here at london by just one hour i see the sun\r\n      rise one hour before you do proceeding in the same direction\r\n      yet another thousand miles i anticipate the rising by two\r\n      hoursanother thousand and i anticipate it by three hours and\r\n      so on until i go entirely round the globe and back to this\r\n      spot when having gone twentyfour thousand miles east i\r\n      anticipate the rising of the london sun by no less than\r\n      twentyfour hours that is to say i am a day in advance of your\r\n      time understand eh\r\n\r\n      uncle but double l dee\r\n\r\n      smitherton speaking very loud captain pratt on the\r\n      contrary when he had sailed a thousand miles west of this\r\n      position was an hour and when he had sailed twentyfour\r\n      thousand miles west was twentyfour hours or one day behind\r\n      the time at london thus with me yesterday was sundaythus\r\n      with you today is sundayand thus with pratt tomorrow will\r\n      be sunday and what is more mr rumgudgeon it is positively\r\n      clear that we are all right for there can be no philosophical\r\n      reason assigned why the idea of one of us should have preference\r\n      over that of the other\r\n\r\n      uncle my eyeswell katewell bobbythis is a judgment upon\r\n      me as you say but i am a man of my wordmark that you shall\r\n      have her boy plum and all when you please done up by jove\r\n      three sundays all in a row ill go and take dubble l dees\r\n      opinion upon that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nend of the project gutenberg ebook of
