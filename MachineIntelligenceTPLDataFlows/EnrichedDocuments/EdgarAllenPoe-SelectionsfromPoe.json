After an engraving by Cole]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nEdgar Allan Poe has been the subject of so much controversy that he is\r\nthe one American writer whom high-school pupils (not to mention\r\nteachers) are likely to approach with ready-made prejudices. It is\r\nimpossible to treat such a subject in quite the ordinary\r\nmatter-of-course way. Furthermore, his writings are so highly\r\nsubjective, and so intimately connected with his strongly held\r\ncritical theories, as to need somewhat careful and extended study.\r\nThese facts make it very difficult to treat either the man or his art\r\nas simply as is desirable in a secondary text-book.  Consequently the\r\nIntroduction is longer and less simple than the editor would desire\r\nfor the usual text. It is believed, however, that the teacher can take\r\nup this Introduction with the pupil in such a way as to make it\r\nhelpful, significant, and interesting.\r\n\r\nThe text of the following poems and tales is that of the\r\nStedman-Woodberry edition (described in the Bibliography, p. xxx), and\r\nthe selections are reprinted by permission of the publishers, Duffield\r\n& Company; this text is followed exactly except for a very few changes\r\nin punctuation, not more than five or six in all. My obligations to\r\nother works are too numerous to mention; all the publications included\r\nin the Bibliography, besides a number of others, have been examined,\r\nbut I especially desire to acknowledge the courtesy of Dr. Henry\r\nBarton Jacobs of Baltimore, who sent me from Paris a copy of Émile\r\nLauvrière's interesting and important study, \"Edgar Poe: Sa vie et son\r\noeuvre; étude de psychologie pathologique.\"  To my wife I am indebted\r\nfor valuable assistance in the tedious work of reading proofs and\r\nverifying the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n  PREFACE\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  POEMS\r\n    SONG\r\n    SPIRITS OF THE DEAD\r\n    TO ----\r\n    ROMANCE\r\n    TO THE RIVER\r\n    TO SCIENCE\r\n    TO HELEN\r\n    ISRAFEL\r\n    THE CITY IN THE SEA\r\n    THE SLEEPER\r\n    LENORE\r\n    THE VALLEY OF UNREST\r\n    THE COLISEUM\r\n    HYMN\r\n    TO ONE IN PARADISE\r\n    TO F----\r\n    TO F----S S.

His life, touched by the extremes of fortune, was\r\non the whole more unhappy than that of any other of our prominent men\r\nof letters. His character was strangely complex, and was the subject\r\nof misunderstanding during his life and of heated dispute after his\r\ndeath; his writings were long neglected or disparaged at home, while\r\naccepted abroad as our greatest literary achievement. Now, after more\r\nthan half a century has elapsed since his death, careful biographers\r\nhave furnished a tolerably full account of the real facts about his\r\nlife; a fairly accurate idea of his character is winning general\r\nacceptance; and the name of Edgar Allan Poe has been conceded a place\r\namong the two or three greatest in our literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE AND CHARACTER\r\n\r\nIn December, 1811, a well-known actress of the time died in Richmond,\r\nleaving destitute three little children, the eldest but four years of\r\nage. This mother, who was Elizabeth (Arnold) Poe, daughter of an\r\nEnglish actress, had suffered from ill health for several years and\r\nhad long found the struggle for existence difficult. Her husband,\r\nDavid Poe, probably died before her; he was a son of General David\r\nPoe, a Revolutionary veteran of Baltimore, and had left his home and\r\nlaw books for the stage several years before his marriage. The second\r\nof the three children, born January 19, 1809, in Boston, where his\r\nparents happened to be playing at the time, was Edgar Poe, the future\r\npoet and story-writer. The little Edgar was adopted by the wife of\r\nMr. John Allan, a well-to-do Scotch merchant of the city, who later\r\nbecame wealthy, and the boy was thereafter known as Edgar Allan\r\nPoe. He was a beautiful and precocious child, who at six years of age\r\ncould read, draw, dance, and declaim the best poetry with fine effect\r\nand appreciation; report says, also, that he had been taught to stand\r\non a chair and pledge Mr. Allan's guests in a glass of wine with\r\n\"roguish grace.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1815 Mr. Allan went to England, where he remained five years. Edgar\r\nwas placed in an old English school in the suburbs of London, among\r\nhistoric, literary, and antiquarian associations, and possibly was\r\ntaken to the Continent by his foster parents at vacation seasons. The\r\nEnglish residence and the sea voyages left deep impressions on the\r\nboy's sensitive nature. Returning to Richmond, he was prepared in good\r\nschools for the University of Virginia, which he entered at the age of\r\nseventeen, pursuing studies in ancient and modern languages and\r\nliteratures. During this youthful period he was already developing a\r\nstriking and peculiar personality. He was brilliant, if not\r\nindustrious, as a student, leaving the University with highest honors\r\nin Latin and French; he was quick and nervous in his movements and\r\ngreatly excelled in athletics, especially in swimming; in character,\r\nhe was reserved, solitary, sensitive, and given to lonely reverie.\r\nSome of his aristocratic playmates remembered to his discredit that he\r\nwas the child of strolling players, and their attitude helped to add a\r\nstrain of defiance to an already intensely proud nature. Though kindly\r\ntreated by his foster parents, this strange boy longed for an\r\nunderstanding sympathy that was not his. Once he thought he had found\r\nit in Mrs. Jane Stannard, mother of a schoolmate; but the new friend\r\nsoon died, and for months the grief-stricken boy, it is said, haunted\r\nthe lonely grave at night and brooded over his loss and the mystery of\r\ndeath--a not very wholesome experience for a lonely and melancholy lad\r\nof fifteen years.\r\n\r\nAt the University he drank wine, though not intemperately, and played\r\ncards a great deal, the end of the term finding him with gambling\r\ndebts of twenty-five hundred dollars. These habits were common at the\r\ntime, and Edgar did not incur any censure from the faculty; but\r\nMr. Allan declined to honor the gambling debt, removed Edgar, and\r\nplaced him in his own counting room. Such a life was too dull for the\r\nhigh-spirited, poetic youth, and he promptly left his home.\r\n\r\nGoing to Boston, he published a thin volume of boyish verse,\r\n\"Tamerlane, and Other Poems,\" but realizing nothing financially,[1] he\r\nenlisted in the United States Army as Edgar A. Perry. After two years\r\nof faithful and efficient service, he procured through Mr. Allan (who\r\nwas temporarily reconciled to him) an appointment to the West Point\r\nMilitary Academy, entering in July, 1830. In the meantime, he had\r\npublished in Baltimore a second small volume of poems. Fellow-students\r\nhave described him as having a \"worn, weary, discontented look\";\r\nusually kindly and courteous, but shy, reserved, and exceedingly\r\nsensitive; an extraordinary reader, but noted for carping criticism.\r\nAlthough a good student, he seemed galled beyond endurance by the\r\nmonotonous routine of military duties, which he deliberately neglected\r\nand thus procured his dismissal from the Academy. He left, alone and\r\npenniless, in March, 1831.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In November, 1900, a single copy of this little volume\r\nsold in New York for $2550.]\r\n\r\nGoing to New York, Poe brought out another little volume of poems\r\nshowing great improvement; then he went to Baltimore, and after a\r\nprecarious struggle of a year or two, turned to prose, and, while in\r\ngreat poverty, won a prize of one hundred dollars from the Baltimore\r\n_Saturday Visitor_ for his story, \"The Manuscript Found in a\r\nBottle.\" Through John P. Kennedy[1], one of the judges whose\r\nfriendship the poverty-stricken author gained, he procured a good deal\r\nof hack work, and finally an editorial position on the _Southern\r\nLiterary Messenger_, of Richmond. The salary was fair, and better\r\nwas in sight; yet Poe was melancholy, dissatisfied, and miserable. He\r\nwrote a pitiable letter to Mr. Kennedy, asking to be convinced \"that\r\nit is at all necessary to live.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A well-known Marylander, author of \"Horse-Shoe Robinson,\"\r\n\"Swallow Barn,\" \"Rob of the Bowl,\" and other popular novels of the\r\nday, and later Secretary of the Navy.]\r\n\r\nFor several years he had been making his home with an aunt, Mrs.\r\nClemm, and her daughter, Virginia, a girl beautiful in character and\r\nperson, but penniless and probably already a victim of the consumption\r\nthat was eventually to cause her death. In 1836, when she was only\r\nfourteen years old, Poe married his cousin, to whom he was\r\npassionately attached. His devotion to her lasted through life, and\r\nthe tenderest affection existed between him and Mrs. Clemm, who was\r\nall a mother could have been to him; so that the home life was always\r\nbeautiful in spirit, however poor in material comfort.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1837, his connection with the _Messenger_ was\r\nsevered, probably because of his occasional lapses from sobriety; but\r\nhis unfortunate temperament and his restless ambition were doubtless\r\nfactors. With some reputation as poet, story-writer, critic, and\r\neditor, Poe removed to New York, and a year later to Philadelphia,\r\nwhere he remained until 1844.  Here he found miscellaneous literary,\r\neditorial, and hack work, finally becoming editor of _Graham's\r\nMagazine_, which prospered greatly under his management, increasing\r\nits circulation from eight thousand to forty thousand within a\r\nyear. But Poe's restless spirit was dissatisfied. He was intensely\r\nanxious to own a magazine for himself, and had already made several\r\nunsuccessful efforts to obtain one,--efforts which were to be repeated\r\nat intervals, and with as little success, until the day his death. He\r\nvainly sought a government position, that a livelihood might be\r\nassured while he carried out his literary plans. Finally he left\r\n_Graham's_, doubtless because of personal peculiarities, since\r\nhis occasional inebriety did not interfere with his work; and there\r\nfollowed a period of wretched poverty, broken once by the winning of a\r\nprize of one hundred dollars for \"The Gold Bug.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued to be known as a \"reserved, isolated, dreamy man, of\r\nhigh-strung nerves, proud spirit, and fantastic moods,\" with a\r\nhaunting sense of impending evil.  His home was poor and simple, but\r\nimpressed every visitor by its neatness and quiet refinement;\r\nVirginia, accomplished in music and languages, was as devoted to her\r\nhusband as he was to her. Both were fond of flowers and plants, and of\r\nhousehold pets. Mrs.  Clemm gave herself completely to her \"children\"\r\nand was the business manager of the family.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1844 Poe went with Virginia to New York, practically\r\npenniless, and to Mrs. Clemm, who did not come at once, he wrote with\r\npathetic enthusiasm of the generous meals served at their boarding\r\nhouse. He obtained a position on the _Evening Mirror_ at small\r\npay, but did his dull work faithfully and efficiently; later, he\r\nbecame editor of the _Broadway Journal_, in which he printed\r\nrevisions of his best tales and poems. In 1845 appeared \"The Raven,\"\r\nwhich created a profound sensation at home and abroad, and immediately\r\nwon, and has since retained, an immense popularity. He was at the\r\nheight of his fame, but poor, as always. In 1846 he published \"The\r\nLiterati,\" critical comments on the writers of the day, in which the\r\nliterary small fry were mercilessly condemned and ridiculed. This\r\nnaturally made Poe a host of enemies. One of these, Thomas Dunn\r\nEnglish, published an abusive article attacking the author's\r\ncharacter, whereupon Poe sued him for libel and obtained two hundred\r\nand twenty-five dollars damages.\r\n\r\nThe family now moved to a little three-room cottage at Fordham, a\r\nquiet country place with flowers and trees and pleasant vistas; but\r\nillness and poverty were soon there, too.  In 1841 Virginia had burst\r\na blood vessel while singing, and her life was despaired of; this had\r\nhappened again and again, leaving her weaker each time. As the summer\r\nand fall of this year wore away, she grew worse and needed the\r\ntenderest care and attention. But winter drew on, and with it came\r\ncold and hunger; the sick girl lay in an unheated room on a straw bed,\r\nwrapped in her husband's coat, the husband and mother trying to chafe\r\na little warmth into her hands and feet. Some kind-hearted women\r\nrelieved the distress in a measure, but on January 30, 1847, Virginia\r\ndied. The effect on Poe was terrible. It is easy to see how a very\r\nartist of death, who could study the dreadful stages of its slow\r\napproach and seek to penetrate the mystery of its ultimate nature with\r\nsuch intense interest and deep reflection as did Poe, must have\r\nbrooded and suffered during the years of his wife's illness.  His own\r\nhealth had long been poor; his brain was diseased and insanity seemed\r\nimminent. After intense grief came a period of settled gloom and\r\nhaunting fear. The less than three years of life left for him was a\r\nperiod of decline in every respect. But he remained in the little\r\ncottage, finding some comfort in caring for his flowers and pets, and\r\ntaking long solitary rambles. During this time he thought out and\r\nwrote \"Eureka,\" a treatise on the structure, laws, and destiny of the\r\nuniverse, which he desired to have regarded as a poem.\r\n\r\nPoe had always felt a need for the companionship of sympathetic and\r\naffectionate women, for whom he entertained a chivalric regard\r\namounting to reverence. After the shock of his wife's death had\r\nsomewhat worn away, he began to depend for sympathy upon various women\r\nwith whom he maintained romantic friendships. Judged by ordinary\r\nstandards, his conduct became at times little short of maudlin; his\r\ncorrespondence showed a sort of gasping, frantic dependence upon the\r\nsympathy and consolation of these women friends, and exhibited a\r\npainful picture of a broken man. Mrs. Shew, one of the kind women who\r\nhad relieved the family at the time of Virginia's last illness,\r\nstrongly advised him to marry, and he did propose marriage to\r\nMrs. Sara Helen Whitman, a verse writer of some note in her day. After\r\na wild and exhausting wooing, begun in an extravagantly romantic\r\nmanner, the match was broken off through the influence of the lady's\r\nfriends. When it was all over Poe seemed very little disturbed. The\r\ntruth is, he was a wreck, and feeling utterly dependent, clutched\r\nfrantically at every hope of sympathy and consolation. His only real\r\nlove was for his dead wife, which he recorded shortly before his death\r\nin the exquisite lyric, \"Annabel Lee.\"\r\n\r\nIn July, 1849, full of the darkest forebodings, and predicting that he\r\nshould never return, Poe went to Richmond. Here he spent a few quiet\r\nmonths, part of the time fairly cheerful, but twice yielding to the\r\ntemptation to drink, and each time suffering, in consequence, a\r\ndangerous illness. On September 30 he left Richmond for New York with\r\nfifteen hundred dollars, the product of a recent lecture arranged by\r\nkind Richmond friends. What happened during the next three days is an\r\nimpenetrable mystery, but on October 3 (Wednesday) he was found in an\r\nelection booth in Baltimore, desperately ill, his money and baggage\r\ngone. The most probable story is that he had been drugged by political\r\nworkers, imprisoned in a \"coop\" with similar victims, and used as a\r\nrepeater [1], this procedure being a common one at the time. Whether\r\nhe was also intoxicated is a matter of doubt. There could be but one\r\neffect on his delicate and already diseased brain. He was taken to a\r\nhospital unconscious, lingered several days in the delirium of a\r\nviolent brain fever, and in the early dawn of Sunday, October 7,\r\nbreathed his last.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Repeater, a person who illegally votes more than once]\r\n\r\nThe dead author's character immediately became the subject of violent\r\ncontroversy. His severe critical strictures had made him many enemies\r\namong the minor writers of the day and their friends. One of the men\r\nwho had suffered from Poe's too caustic pen was Rufus W. Griswold, but\r\nfriendly relations had been nominally established and Poe had\r\nauthorized Griswold to edit his works. This Griswold did, including a\r\nbiography which Poe's friends declared a masterpiece of malicious\r\ndistortion and misrepresentation; it certainly was grossly unfair and\r\ninaccurate. Poe's friends retorted, and a long war of words followed,\r\nin which hatred or prejudice on the one side and wholesale,\r\nundiscriminating laudation on the other, alike tended to obscure the\r\ntruth. It is now almost impossible to see the real Poe, just as he\r\nappeared to an ordinary, unprejudiced observer of his own time. Only\r\nby the most careful, thoughtful, and sympathetic study can we hope to\r\napproximate such an acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental fact about Poe is a very peculiar and unhappy\r\ntemperament, certain characteristic qualities of which began to\r\ndisclose themselves in early boyhood and, fostered by the vicissitudes\r\nof his career, developed throughout his life.\r\n\r\nIn youth he was nervous, sensitive, morbid, proud, solitary, and\r\nwayward; and as the years went by, bringing poverty, illness, and the\r\nbitterness of failure, often through his own faults, the man became\r\nirritable, impatient, often morose. He had always suffered from fits\r\nof depression,--\"blue devils,\" Mr.  Kennedy called them,--and though\r\nhe was extravagantly sanguine at times, melancholy was his usual mood,\r\noften manifesting itself in a haunting fear of evil to come. The\r\npeculiar character of his wonderful imagination made actual life less\r\nreal to him than his own land of dreams: the \"distant Aidenn,\" the\r\n\"dim lake of Auber,\" the \"kingdom by the sea,\" seemed more genuine\r\nthan the landscapes of earth; the lurid \"city in the sea\" more\r\nsubstantial than the streets he daily walked.\r\n\r\nBecause of this intensely subjective and self-absorbed character of\r\nmind, he had no understanding of human nature, no insight into\r\ncharacter with its marvelous complexities and contradictions. With\r\nthese limitations Poe, as might be expected, had a very defective\r\nsense of humor, lacked true sympathy, was tactless, possessed little\r\nbusiness ability, and was excessively annoyed by the dull routine and\r\nrude frictions of ordinary life. He was always touched by kindness,\r\nbut was quick to resent an injury, and even as a boy could not endure\r\na jest at his expense. He had many warm and devoted friends whom he\r\nloved in return, but the limitations of his own nature probably made a\r\nreally frank, unreserved friendship impossible; and when a break\r\noccurred, he was apt to assume that his former friend was an utter\r\nvillain. These personal characteristics, in conjunction with a goading\r\nambition which took form in the idea of an independent journal of his\r\nown in which he might find untrammeled expression, added uneasiness\r\nand restlessness to a constantly discontented nature. To some extent,\r\nat least, Poe realized the curse of such a temperament, but he strove\r\nvainly against its impulses.\r\n\r\nThe one genuine human happiness of this sad life was found in a\r\nsingularly beautiful home atmosphere. Husband and wife were\r\npassionately devoted to each other, and Mrs. Clemm was more than a\r\nmother to both. She says of her son-in-law: \"At home, he was simple\r\nand affectionate as a child, and during all the years he lived with\r\nme, I do not remember a single night that he failed to come and kiss\r\nhis 'mother,' as he called me, before going to bed.\" This faithful\r\nwoman remained devoted to him after Virginia's death, and to his\r\nmemory, when calumny assailed it, after his own.\r\n\r\nThe capital charge against Poe's character has been intemperance, and\r\nalthough the matter has been grossly exaggerated and misrepresented,\r\nthe charge is true. Except for short periods, he was never what is\r\nknown as dissipated, and he struggled desperately against his\r\nweakness,--an unequal struggle, since the craving was inherited, and\r\nfostered by environment, circumstances, and temperament. One of his\r\nbiographers tells of bread soaked in gin being fed to the little Poe\r\nchildren by an old nurse during the illness of their mother; and there\r\nis another story, already mentioned, of the little Edgar, in his\r\nadoptive home, taught to pledge the guests as a social grace.\r\nDrinking was common at the time, wine was offered in every home and at\r\nevery social function, and in the South, where Poe spent his youth and\r\nearly manhood, the spirit of hospitality and conviviality held out\r\nconstant temptation. To his delicate organization strong drink early\r\nbecame a veritable poison, and indulgence that would have been a small\r\nmatter to another man was ruinous to him; indeed, a single glass of\r\nwine drove him practically insane, and a debauch was sure to\r\nfollow. Indulgence was stimulated, also, by the nervous strain and\r\nworry induced by uncertain livelihood and privation, the frequent fits\r\nof depression, and by constant brooding. Sometimes he fought his\r\nweakness successfully for several years, but always it conquered in\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he speaks of a very special cause in the latter part of his\r\nlife, which in fairness should be heard in his own written words to a\r\nfriend: \"Six years ago a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved\r\nbefore, ruptured a blood vessel in singing. Her life was despaired\r\nof. I took leave of her forever and underwent all the agonies of her\r\ndeath. She recovered partially and I again hoped. At the end of a year\r\nthe vessel broke again. I went through precisely the same scene....\r\nThen again--again--and even once again, at varying intervals. Each\r\ntime I felt all the agonies of her death--and at each accession of her\r\ndisorder I loved her more dearly and clung to her life with more\r\ndesperate pertinacity. But I am constitutionally sensitive--nervous in\r\na very unusual degree.  I became insane, with long intervals of\r\nhorrible sanity. During these fits of absolute unconsciousness, I\r\ndrank--God only knows how often or how much. As a matter of course, my\r\nenemies referred the insanity to the drink, rather than the drink to\r\nthe insanity.... It was the horrible never-ending oscillation between\r\nhope and despair, which I could _not_ longer have endured without\r\ntotal loss of reason. In the death of what was my life, then, I\r\nreceived a new, but--O God!--how melancholy an existence!\"\r\n\r\nThis statement, and the other facts mentioned, are not offered as\r\nwholly excusing Poe. Doubtless a stronger man would have resisted,\r\ndoubtless a less self-absorbed man would have thought of his wife's\r\nhappiness as well as of his own relief from torture. Yet the\r\nfair-minded person, familiar with Poe's unhappy life, and keeping in\r\nmind the influences of heredity, temperament, and environment, will\r\nhesitate to pronounce a severe judgment.\r\n\r\nPoe was also accused of untruthfulness, and this accusation likewise\r\nhas a basis of fact. He repeatedly furnished or approved statements\r\nregarding his life and work that were incorrect, he often made a\r\ndisingenuous show of pretended learning, and he sometimes misstated\r\nfacts to avoid wounding his own vanity. This ugly fault seems to have\r\nresulted from a fondness for romantic posing, and is doubtless related\r\nto the peculiar character of imagination already mentioned. Perhaps,\r\ntoo, he inherited from his actor parents a love of applause, and if\r\nso, the trait was certainly encouraged in early childhood.  There is\r\nno evidence that he was ever guilty of malicious or mercenary\r\nfalsehood.\r\n\r\nAnother of his bad habits was borrowing, but it must be remembered\r\nthat his life was one long struggle with grinding poverty, that he and\r\nthose dear to him sometimes suffered actual hunger and cold. Many who\r\nknew him testified to his anxiety to pay all his debts, Mr. Graham\r\nreferring to him in this particular as \"the soul of honor.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Lowell, Poe has well described himself in a sentence:\r\n\"My life has been whim--impulse--passion--a longing for solitude--a\r\nscorn of all things present in an earnest desire for the future.\"\r\nInterpreted, this means that in a sense he never really reached\r\nmaturity, that he remained a slave to his impulses and emotions, that\r\nhe detested the ordinary business of life and could not adapt himself\r\nto it, that his mind was full of dreams of ideal beauty and\r\nperfection, that his whole soul yearned to attain the highest\r\npleasures of artistic creation. His was perpetually a deeply agitated\r\nsoul; as such, it was natural he should outwardly seem irritable,\r\nimpatient, restless, discontented, and solitary. It is impossible to\r\nbelieve that there was any strain of real evil in Poe. A man who could\r\ninspire such devotion as he had from such a woman as Mrs. Clemm, a man\r\nwho loved flowers and children and animal pets, who could be so\r\ndevoted a husband, who could so consecrate himself to art, was not a\r\nbad man. Yet his acts were often, as we have seen, most\r\nreprehensible. Frequently the subject of slander, he was not a victim\r\nof conspiracy to defame. Although circumstances were many times\r\nagainst him, he was his own worst enemy. He was cursed with a\r\ntemperament. His mind was analytical and imaginative, and gave no\r\nthought to the ethical. He remained wayward as a child. The man, like\r\nhis art, was not immoral, but simply unmoral. Whatever his faults, he\r\nsuffered frightfully for them, and his fame suffered after him.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY WORK\r\n\r\nPoe's first literary ventures were in verse. The early volumes,\r\nshowing strongly the influence of Byron and Moore, were productions of\r\nsmall merit but large promise. Their author was soon to become one of\r\nthe most original of poets, his later work being unique, with a\r\nstrangely individual, \"Poe\" atmosphere that no other writer has ever\r\nbeen able successfully to imitate. His verse is individual in theme,\r\ntreatment, and structure, all of which harmonize with his conscious\r\ntheory of poetic art. His theory is briefly this: It is not the\r\nfunction of poetry to teach either truth or morals, but to gratify\r\nthrough novel forms \"the thirst for supernal beauty\"; its proper\r\neffect is to \"excite, by elevating, the soul.\" The highest beauty has\r\nalways some admixture of sadness, the most poetical of all themes\r\nbeing the death of a beautiful woman. Moreover, the pleasure derived\r\nfrom the contemplation of this higher beauty should be indefinite;\r\nthat is, true poetic feeling is not the result of coherent narrative\r\nor clear pictures or fine moral sentiment, but consists in vague,\r\nexalted emotion. Music, of all the arts, produces the vaguest and most\r\n\"indefinite\" pleasure; consequently verse forms should be chosen with\r\nthe greatest possible attention to musical effect. Poetry must be\r\npurely a matter of feeling. \"Its sole arbiter is Taste. With the\r\nIntellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral relations.\"\r\n\r\nThis explanation is necessary, because the stock criticism of Poe's\r\npoetry condemns it as vague, indefinite, and devoid of thought or\r\nethical content. These are precisely its limitations, but hardly its\r\nfaults, since the poet attained with marvelous art the very effects he\r\ndesired. The themes of nearly all the poems are death, ruin, regret,\r\nor failure; the verse is original in form, and among the most musical\r\nin the language, full of a haunting, almost magical melody. Mystery,\r\nsymbolism, shadowy suggestion, fugitive thought, elusive beauty,\r\nbeings that are mere insubstantial abstractions--these are the\r\ncharacteristics, but designedly so, of Poe's poetry. A poem to him was\r\nsimply a crystallized mood, and it is futile for his readers to apply\r\nany other test. Yet the influence of this verse has been wide and\r\nimportant, extending to most lyric poets of the last half-century,\r\nincluding such masters as Rossetti and Swinburne.\r\n\r\n\"To Helen,\" a poem of three brief stanzas, is Poe's first really\r\nnotable production; it is an exquisite tribute of his reverent\r\ndevotion to his boyhood friend, Mrs. Stannard, portraying her as a\r\nclassic embodiment of beauty. \"Israfel\" is a lyric of aspiration of\r\nrare power and rapture, worthy of Shelley, and is withal the most\r\nspontaneous, simple, and genuinely human poem Poe ever wrote. \"The\r\nHaunted Palace,\" one of the finest of his poems, is an unequaled\r\nallegory of the wreck and ruin of sovereign reason, which to be fully\r\nappreciated should be read in its somber setting, \"The Fall of the\r\nHouse of Usher.\" Less attractive is \"The Conqueror Worm,\" with its\r\nrepulsive imagery, but this \"tragedy 'Man,'\" with the universe as a\r\ntheater, moving to the \"music of the spheres,\" and \"horror the soul of\r\nthe plot,\" is undeniably powerful and intensely terrible.\r\n\r\n\"The Raven,\" published in 1845, attained immediately a world-wide\r\ncelebrity, and rivals in fame and popularity any lyric ever written.\r\nIt is the most elaborate treatment of Poe's favorite theme, the death\r\nof a beautiful woman. The reveries of a bereaved lover, alone in his\r\nlibrary at midnight in \"the bleak December,\" vainly seeking to forget\r\nhis sorrow for the \"lost Lenore,\" are interrupted by a tapping, as of\r\nsome one desirous to enter. After a time, he admits a \"stately raven\"\r\nand seeks to beguile his sad fancy by putting questions to the bird,\r\nwhose one reply is \"Nevermore,\" and this constitutes the refrain of\r\nthe poem. Impelled by an instinct of self-torture, the lover asks\r\nwhether he shall have \"respite\" from the painful memories of \"Lenore,\"\r\nhere or hereafter, and finally whether in the \"distant Aidenn\" he and\r\nhis love shall be reunited; to all of which the raven returns his one\r\nanswer. Driven to frenzy, the lover implores the bird, \"Take thy beak\r\nfrom out my heart, and take thy form from off my door,\" only to learn\r\nthat the shadow will be lifted \"nevermore.\" The raven is, in the\r\npoet's own words, \"emblematical of Mournful and Never-Ending\r\nRemembrance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ulalume\" has been commonly (though not always) regarded as a mere\r\nexperiment in verbal ingenuity, meaningless melody, or \"the insanity\r\nof versification,\" as a distinguished American critic has called\r\nit. Such a judgment is a mark of inability to understand Poe's most\r\ncharacteristic work, for in truth \"Ulalume\" is the extreme expression\r\nat once of his critical theory and of his peculiar genius as a\r\npoet. It was published in December of the same year in which Virginia\r\ndied in January. The poet's condition has already been described;\r\n\"Ulalume\" is a marvelous expression of his mood at this time.  It\r\ndepicts a soul worn out by long suffering, groping for courage and\r\nhope, only to return again to \"the door of a legended tomb.\" It is\r\ntrue the movement is slow, impeded by the frequent repetitions, but so\r\nthe wearied mind, after nervous exhaustion, is \"palsied and sere.\"\r\nThere is no appeal to the intellect, but this is characteristic of Poe\r\nand appropriate to a mind numbed by protracted suffering. It is this\r\nmood of wearied, benumbed, discouraged, hopeless hope, feebly seeking\r\nfor the \"Lethean peace of the skies\" only to find the mind inevitably\r\nreverting to the \"lost Ulalume,\" that finds expression. There is no\r\ndefinite thought, because only the communication of feeling is\r\nintended; there is no distinct setting, because the whole action is\r\nspiritual; \"the dim lake\" and \"dark tarn of Auber,\" \"the ghoul-haunted\r\nwoodland of Weir,\" \"the alley Titanic of cypress,\" are the\r\ngrief-stricken and fear-haunted places of the poet's own darkened\r\nmind, while the ashen skies of \"the lonesome October\" are significant\r\nenough of this \"most immemorial year.\" The poem is a monody of\r\nnerveless, exhausted grief. As such it must be read to be appreciated,\r\nas such it must be judged, and so appreciated and so judged it is\r\nabsolutely unique and incomparable.\r\n\r\nAbout a year later came \"The Bells,\" wonderful for the music of its\r\nverse, and the finest onomatopoetic poem in the language. Two days\r\nafter Poe's death appeared \"Annabel Lee,\" a simple, sincere, and\r\nbeautiful ballad, a tribute to his dead wife. Last of all was printed\r\nthe brief \"Eldorado,\" a fitting death-song for Poe, in which a gallant\r\nknight sets out, \"singing a song,\" \"in search of Eldorado,\" only to\r\nlearn when youth and strength are gone that he must seek his goal\r\n\"down the Valley of the Shadow.\"\r\n\r\nThe tales, like the poems, are a real contribution to the world's\r\nliterature, but more strikingly so, since the type itself is\r\noriginal. Poe, Hawthorne, and Irving are distinctly the pioneers in\r\nthe production of the modern short story, and neither has been\r\nsurpassed on his own ground; but Poe has been vastly the greater\r\ninfluence in foreign countries, especially in France. Poe formed a new\r\nconception of the short story, one which Professor Brander Matthews[1]\r\nhas treated formally and explicitly as a distinct literary form,\r\ndifferent from the story that is merely short. Without calling it a\r\ndistinct form, Poe implied the idea in a review of Hawthorne's\r\n\"Twice-Told Tales\":\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"The Philosophy of the Short-Story,\" Chapter IV of \"Pen\r\nand Ink.\"]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary novel is objectionable from its length.... As it cannot\r\nbe read at one sitting, it deprives itself, of course, of the immense\r\nforce derivable from _totality_.... In the brief tale, however,\r\nthe author is enabled to carry out the fulness of his intention, be it\r\nwhat it may. During the hour of perusal, the soul of the reader is at\r\nthe writer's control....\r\n\r\nA skillful literary artist has constructed a tale. If wise, he has not\r\nfashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents; but having\r\nconceived with deliberate care a certain unique or single\r\n_effect_ to be wrought out, he then invents such incidents--he\r\nthen combines such events as may best aid him in establishing this\r\npreconceived effect. If his very initial sentence tend not to the\r\nout-bringing of this effect, then he has failed in his first step. In\r\nthe whole composition there should be no word written, of which the\r\ntendency, direct or indirect, is not to the one preëstablished design.\r\n\r\nThis idea of a short story should be kept in mind in reading Poe's\r\nworks, for he applied his theory perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe stories are of greater variety than the poems. There are romances\r\nof death whose themes are fear, horror, madness, catalepsy, premature\r\nburial, torture, mesmerism, and revengeful cruelty; tales of weird\r\nbeauty; allegories of conscience; narratives of pseudo-science;\r\nstories of analytical reasoning; descriptions of beautiful landscapes;\r\nand what are usually termed \"prose poems.\" He also wrote tales\r\ngrotesque, humorous, and satirical, most of which are failures. The\r\nearlier tales are predominantly imaginative and emotional; most of the\r\nlater ones are predominantly intellectual. None of the tales touches\r\nordinary, healthy life; there is scarcely a suggestion of local color;\r\nthe humor is nearly always mechanical; there is little conversation\r\nand the characters are never normal human beings. Although the stories\r\nare strongly romantic in subject, plot, and setting, there is an\r\nextraordinary realism in treatment, a minuteness and accuracy of\r\ndetail equaling the work of Defoe.  This is one secret of the magical\r\nart that not only transports us to the world of dream and vision where\r\nthe author's own soul roamed, but for the time makes it all real to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nPoe's finest tale, as a work of art, is \"The Fall of the House of\r\nUsher,\" which is as nearly perfect in its craftsmanship as human work\r\nmay be. It is a romance of death with a setting of profound gloom, and\r\nis wrought out as a highly imaginative study in fear--a symphony in\r\nwhich every touch blends into a perfect unity of effect. \"Ligeia,\"\r\nperhaps standing next, incorporating \"The Conqueror Worm\" as its\r\nkeynote, portrays the terrific struggle of a woman's will against\r\ndeath.  \"The Masque of the Red Death,\" a tale of the Spirit of\r\nPestilence and of Death victorious over human selfishness and power,\r\nis a splendid study in somber color. \"The Assignation,\" a romance of\r\nVenice, is also splendid in coloring and rich in decorative effects,\r\npresenting a luxury of sorrow culminating in romantic suicide.\r\n\"William Wilson\" is an allegory of conscience personified in a double,\r\nthe forerunner of Stevenson's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\" Other\r\nconscience stories are \"The Man of the Crowd\"; \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\"\r\nalso depicting insanity; and \"The Black Cat,\" of which the atmosphere\r\nis horror. \"The Adventures of One Hans Pfaal\" and \"The Balloon Hoax\"\r\nare examples of the pseudo-scientific tales, which attain their\r\nverisimilitude by diverting attention from the improbability or\r\nimpossibility of the general incidents to the accuracy and naturalness\r\nof details. In \"The Descent into the Maëlstrom,\" scientific reasoning\r\nis skillfully blended with imaginative strength, poetic description,\r\nand stirring adventure. This type of story is clearly enough the\r\noriginal of those of Jules Verne and similar writers. \"The Murders in\r\nthe Rue Morgue\" and \"The Purloined Letter\" are the pioneer detective\r\nstories, Dupin the original Sherlock Holmes, and they remain the best\r\nof their kind, unsurpassed in originality, ingenuity, and\r\nplausibility. Another type of the story of analytical reasoning is\r\n\"The Gold-Bug,\" built around the solution of a cryptogram, but also\r\nintroducing an element of adventure. Poe's analytical power was real,\r\nnot a trick. If he made Legrand solve the cryptogram and boast his\r\nability to solve others more difficult, Poe himself solved scores sent\r\nhim in response to a public magazine challenge; if Dupin solved\r\nmysteries that Poe invented for him, Poe himself wrote in \"Marie\r\nRoget,\" from newspaper accounts, the solution of a real murder\r\nmystery, and astounded Dickens by outlining the entire plot of\r\n\"Barnaby Rudge\" when only a few of the first chapters had been\r\npublished; if he wrote imaginatively of science, he in fact\r\ndemonstrated in \"Maelzel's Chess Player\" that a pretended automaton\r\nwas operated by a man. \"Hop Frog\" and \"The Cask of Amontillado\" are\r\nold-world stories of revenge. \"The Island of the Fay\" and \"The Domain\r\nof Arnheim\" are landscape studies, the one of calm loveliness, the\r\nother of Oriental profusion and coloring. \"Shadow\" and \"Silence\" are\r\ncommonly classed as \"prose poems,\" the former being one of Poe's most\r\neffective productions. \"Eleonora,\" besides having a story to tell, is\r\nboth a prose poem and a landscape study, and withal one of Poe's most\r\nexquisite writings.\r\n\r\nAlthough Poe was not a great critic, his critical work is by no means\r\nvalueless. He applied for the first time in America a thoroughgoing\r\nscrutiny and able, fearless criticism to contemporary literature,\r\nundoubtedly with good effect. His attacks on didacticism were\r\nespecially valuable. His strength as a critic lay in his artistic\r\ntemperament and in the incisive intellect that enabled him to analyze\r\nthe effects produced in his own creations and in those of others. His\r\nweaknesses were extravagance; a mania for harping on plagiarism; lack\r\nof spiritual insight, broad sympathies, and profound scholarship; and,\r\nin general, the narrow range of his genius, which has already been\r\nmade sufficiently clear. His severity has been exaggerated, as he\r\noften praised highly, probably erring more frequently by undue\r\nlaudation than by extreme severity. Though personal prejudice\r\nsometimes crept into his work, especially in favor of women, yet on\r\nthe whole he was as fair and fearless as he claimed to be. Much of the\r\nhasty, journalistic hack work is valueless, as might be expected, but\r\nhe wrote very suggestively of his art, and nearly all his judgments\r\nhave been sustained. Moreover, he met one supreme test of a critic in\r\nrecognizing unknown genius: Dickens he was among the first to appraise\r\nas a great novelist; Tennyson and Elizabeth Barrett (Browning) he\r\nranked among the great poets without hesitation; and at home he early\r\nexpressed a due appreciation of Hawthorne, Lowell, Longfellow, and\r\nBryant.\r\n\r\nPoe's place, both in prose and poetry, is assured. His recognition\r\nabroad has been clear and emphatic from the first, especially in\r\nFrance, and to-day foreigners generally regard him as the greatest\r\nwriter we have produced, an opinion in which a number of our own\r\ncritics and readers concur. One's judgment in the matter will depend\r\nupon the point of view and the standards adopted; it is too large a\r\nsubject to consider here, but if artistic craftsmanship be the\r\nstandard, certainly Hawthorne would be his only rival, and Hawthorne\r\nwas not also a poet.  The question of exact relative rank, however, it\r\nis neither possible nor important to settle. It is sufficient to say,\r\nin the words of Professor Woodberry, \"On the roll of our literature\r\nPoe's name is inscribed among the few foremost, and in the world at\r\nlarge his genius is established as valid among all men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nThe year after Poe's death there appeared \"The Works of the Late Edgar\r\nAllan Poe,\" with a Memoir, in two volumes, edited by R. W. Griswold\r\nand published by J. S. Redfield, New York. The same editor and\r\npublisher brought out a four-volume edition in 1856. Griswold had\r\nsuffered from Poe's sharp criticisms and had quarreled with him,\r\nthough later there was a reconciliation, and Poe himself selected\r\nGriswold to edit his works. The biographer painted the dead author\r\nvery black indeed, and his account is now generally considered unfair.\r\n\r\nIn 1874-1875 \"The Works of Edgar Allan Poe,\" with Memoir, edited by\r\nJohn H. Ingram, were published in four volumes, in Edinburgh, and in\r\n1876 in New York. Ingram represents the other extreme from Griswold,\r\nattempting to defend practically everything that Poe was and did.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 A. C. Armstrong & Son, New York, brought out \"The Works of\r\nEdgar Allan Poe\" in six volumes, with an Introduction and Memoir by\r\nRichard Henry Stoddard. Stoddard is far from doing justice to Poe\r\neither as man or as author.\r\n\r\nAlthough Griswold's editing was poor, subsequent editions followed his\r\nuntil 1895, when Professor George E. Woodberry and Mr. Edmund Clarence\r\nStedman published a new edition in ten volumes through Stone &\r\nKimball, Chicago (now published by Duffield & Company, New York). This\r\nedition is incomparably superior to all its predecessors, going to the\r\noriginal sources, and establishing an authentic text, corrected\r\nslightly in quotations and punctuation. Professor Woodberry\r\ncontributed a Memoir, and Mr. Stedman admirable critical articles on\r\nthe poems and the tales. Scholarly notes, an extensive bibliography, a\r\nnumber of portraits, and variorum readings of the poems, are included.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 T.Y. Crowell & Company, New York, issued \"The Complete Works\r\nof Edgar Allan Poe\" in seventeen volumes, edited by Professor James\r\nA. Harrison, including a biography and a volume of letters. This\r\nedition contains much of Poe's criticism not published in previous\r\neditions, and follows Poe's latest text exactly; complete variorum\r\nreadings are included.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 there also appeared \"The Booklover's Arnheim\" edition in ten\r\nvolumes, edited by Professor Charles F. Richardson and published by\r\nG.P. Putnam's Sons, New York. This is mechanically the finest edition\r\nof Poe's works.\r\n\r\nThe one-volume collections of poems and of tales are almost\r\ninnumerable, but nearly all are devoid of merit and poorly edited in\r\nselection, text, and notes. (This does not refer to the small\r\ncollections for study in schools.) The best are the following: \"Tales\r\nof Mystery,\" Unit Book Publishing Company, New York (72 cents); \"The\r\nBest Tales of Edgar Allan Poe,\" edited with critical studies by\r\nSherwin Cody, A.C. McClurg & Company, Chicago ($1.00); \"The Best Poems\r\nand Essays of E. A. Poe,\" edited with biographical and critical\r\nintroduction by Sherwin Cody, McClurg ($1.00); \"Poems of E. A. Poe,\"\r\ncomplete, edited and annotated by Charles W. Kent, The Macmillan\r\nCompany, New York (25 cents).\r\n\r\nProfessor George E. Woodberry contributed in 1885 a volume on Poe to\r\nthe American Men of Letters Series (Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Boston),\r\nwhich is the ablest yet written. In scholarship and critical\r\nappreciation it is all that could be desired, but unfortunately it is\r\nunsympathetic. Mr.  Woodberry assumed a coldly judicial attitude, in\r\nwhich mood he is occasionally a little less than just to Poe's\r\ncharacter.  Professor Harrison's biography, written for the Virginia\r\nedition, is published separately by T.Y. Crowell & Company. It is very\r\nfull, and valuable for the mass of material supplied, but is not\r\ndiscriminating in criticism or estimate of Poe's character.\r\n\r\nNumerous magazine articles may be found by consulting the periodical\r\nindexes. A number of suggestive short studies are to be found in the\r\ntext-books of American literature, such as those of Messrs. Trent,\r\nAbernethy, Newcomer, and Wendell; and in the larger books of\r\nProfessors Richardson, Trent, and Wendell. One may also find acute and\r\nvaluable comment in such works as Professor Bliss Perry's \"A Study of\r\nProse Fiction,\" and Professor Brander Matthews's \"Philosophy of the\r\nShort-Story\" (published separately, and in \"Pen and Ink\").\r\n\r\nMany of Poe's tales and poems have been translated into practically\r\nall the important languages of modern Europe, including Greek. An\r\nimportant French study of Poe, recently published, is mentioned in the\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOEMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw thee on thy bridal day,\r\n  When a burning blush came o'er thee,\r\nThough happiness around thee lay,\r\n  The world all love before thee;\r\n\r\nAnd in thine eye a kindling light                           5\r\n  (Whatever it might be)\r\nWas all on Earth my aching sight\r\n  Of loveliness could see.\r\n\r\nThat blush, perhaps, was maiden shame:\r\n  As such it well may pass,                                10\r\nThough its glow hath raised a fiercer flame\r\n  In the breast of him, alas!\r\n\r\nWho saw thee on that bridal day,\r\n  When that deep blush _would_ come o'er thee,\r\nThough happiness around thee lay,                          15\r\n  The world all love before thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIRITS OF THE DEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nThy soul shall find itself alone\r\n'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone;\r\nNot one, of all the crowd, to pry\r\nInto thine hour of secrecy.\r\n\r\nBe silent in that solitude,                                 5\r\n  Which is not loneliness--for then\r\nThe spirits of the dead, who stood\r\n  In life before thee, are again\r\nIn death around thee, and their will\r\nShall overshadow thee; be still.                           10\r\n\r\nThe night, though clear, shall frown,\r\nAnd the stars shall look not down\r\nFrom their high thrones in the Heaven\r\nWith light like hope to mortals given,\r\nBut their red orbs, without beam,                          15\r\nTo thy weariness shall seem\r\nAs a burning and a fever\r\nWhich would cling to thee forever.\r\n\r\nNow are thoughts thou shalt not banish,\r\nNow are visions ne'er to vanish;                           20\r\nFrom thy spirit shall they pass\r\nNo more, like dewdrops from the grass.\r\n\r\nThe breeze, the breath of God, is still,\r\nAnd the mist upon the hill\r\nShadowy, shadowy, yet unbroken,                            25\r\nIs a symbol and a token.\r\nHow it hangs upon the trees,\r\nA mystery of mysteries!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----\r\n\r\n\r\nI heed not that my earthly lot\r\n  Hath little of Earth in it,\r\nThat years of love have been forgot\r\n  In the hatred of a minute:\r\n\r\nI mourn not that the desolate                               5\r\n  Are happier, sweet, than I,\r\nBut that you sorrow for my fate\r\n  Who am a passer-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROMANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nRomance, who loves to nod and sing\r\nWith drowsy head and folded wing\r\nAmong the green leaves as they shake\r\nFar down within some shadowy lake,\r\nTo me a painted paroquet                                    5\r\nHath been--a most familiar bird--\r\nTaught me my alphabet to say,\r\nTo lisp my very earliest word\r\nWhile in the wild-wood I did lie,\r\nA child--with a most knowing eye.                          10\r\n\r\nOf late, eternal condor years\r\nSo shake the very heaven on high\r\nWith tumult as they thunder by,\r\nI have no time for idle cares\r\nThrough gazing on the unquiet sky;                         15\r\nAnd when an hour with calmer wings\r\nIts down upon my spirit flings,\r\nThat little time with lyre and rhyme\r\nTo while away--forbidden things--\r\nMy heart would feel to be a crime                          20\r\nUnless it trembled with the strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\nFair river! in thy bright, clear flow\r\n  Of crystal, wandering water,\r\nThou art an emblem of the glow\r\n    Of beauty--the unhidden heart,\r\n    The playful maziness of art                             5\r\n  In old Alberto's daughter;\r\n\r\nBut when within thy wave she looks,\r\n  Which glistens then, and trembles,\r\nWhy, then, the prettiest of brooks\r\n  Her worshipper resembles;                                10\r\nFor in his heart, as in thy stream,\r\n  Her image deeply lies--\r\nHis heart which trembles at the beam\r\n  Of her soul-searching eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SCIENCE\r\n\r\nA PROLOGUE TO \"AL AARAAF\"\r\n\r\n\r\nScience! true daughter of Old Time thou art,\r\n  Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.\r\nWhy preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,\r\n  Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?\r\nHow should he love thee?

5\r\n  A play of hopes and fears,\r\nWhile the orchestra breathes fitfully\r\n  The music of the spheres.\r\n\r\nMimes, in the form of God on high,\r\n  Mutter and mumble low,                                   10\r\n\r\nAnd hither and thither fly;\r\n  Mere puppets they, who come and go\r\nAt bidding of vast formless things\r\n  That shift the scenery to and fro,\r\nFlapping from out their condor wings                       15\r\n  Invisible Woe.\r\n\r\nThat motley drama--oh, be sure\r\n  It shall not be forgot!\r\nWith its Phantom chased for evermore\r\n  By a crowd that seize it not,                            20\r\nThrough a circle that ever returneth in\r\n  To the self-same spot;\r\nAnd much of Madness, and more of Sin,\r\n  And Horror the soul of the plot.\r\n\r\nBut see amid the mimic rout                                25\r\n  A crawling shape, intrude:\r\nA blood-red thing that writhes from out\r\n  The scenic solitude!\r\nIt writhes--it writhes!--with mortal pangs\r\n  The

curtain, a funeral pall,                               35\r\n  Comes down with the rush of a storm,\r\nWhile the angels, all pallid and wan,\r\n  Uprising, unveiling, affirm\r\nThat the play is the tragedy, \"Man,\"\r\n  And its hero, the Conqueror Worm.                        40\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDREAM-LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nBy a route obscure and lonely,\r\nHaunted by ill angels only,\r\nWhere an Eidolon, named Night,\r\nOn a black throne reigns upright,\r\nI have reached these lands but newly                        5\r\nFrom an ultimate dim Thule:\r\nFrom a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,\r\n  Out of Space--out of Time.\r\nBottomless vales and boundless floods,\r\nAnd chasms and caves and Titan woods,                      10\r\nWith forms that no man can discover\r\nFor the tears that drip all over;\r\nMountains toppling evermore\r\nInto seas without a shore;\r\nSeas that restlessly aspire,                               15\r\nSurging, unto skies of fire;\r\nLakes that endlessly outspread\r\nTheir lone waters, lone and dead,--\r\nTheir still waters, still and chilly\r\nWith the snows of the lolling lily.                        20\r\n\r\nBy the lakes that thus outspread\r\nTheir lone waters, lone and dead,--\r\nTheir sad waters, sad and chilly\r\nWith the snows of the lolling lily;\r\nBy the mountains--near the river                           25\r\nMurmuring lowly, murmuring ever;\r\nBy the gray woods, by the swamp\r\nWhere the toad and the newt encamp;\r\nBy the dismal tarns and pools\r\n    Where dwell the Ghouls;                                30\r\nBy each spot the most unholy,\r\nIn each nook most melancholy,--\r\nThere the traveller meets aghast\r\nSheeted Memories of the Past:\r\nShrouded forms that start and sigh                         35\r\nAs they pass the wanderer by,\r\nWhite-robed forms of friends long given,\r\nIn agony, to the Earth--and Heaven.\r\n\r\nFor the heart whose woes are legion\r\n'T is a peaceful, soothing region;                         40\r\nFor the spirit that walks in shadow\r\n'T is--oh, 't is an Eldorado!\r\nBut the traveller, travelling through it,\r\nMay not--dare not openly view it;\r\nNever its mysteries are exposed                            45\r\nTo the weak human eye unclosed;\r\nSo wills its King, who hath forbid\r\nThe uplifting of the fringéd lid;\r\nAnd thus the sad Soul that here passes\r\nBeholds it but through darkened glasses.                   50\r\nBy a route obscure and lonely,\r\nHaunted by ill angels only,\r\nWhere an Eidolon, named Night,\r\nOn a black throne reigns upright,\r\nI have wandered home but newly                             55\r\nFrom this ultimate dim Thule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\r\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of, forgotten lore,--\r\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\r\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\r\n\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door:                  5\r\n          Only this and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\r\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\r\nEagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow\r\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore,                 10\r\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore:\r\n          Nameless here forevermore.\r\n\r\nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\r\nThrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\r\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating              15\r\n\"'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,\r\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door:\r\n          This it is and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\r\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;                   20\r\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\r\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\r\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door:--\r\n          Darkness there and nothing more.\r\n\r\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,       25\r\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;\r\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\r\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore?\"\r\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore:\"\r\n          Merely this and nothing more.                                       30\r\n\r\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\r\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\r\n\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;\r\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore;\r\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore:                      35\r\n          'T is the wind and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\r\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.\r\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\r\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door,                40\r\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door:\r\n          Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling\r\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,--\r\n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,    45\r\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore:\r\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the  Night's Plutonian shore!\"\r\n          Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\r\nThough its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;                      50\r\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door,\r\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\r\n          With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only                  55\r\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\r\nNothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered,\r\nTill I scarcely more than muttered,--\"Other friends have flown before;\r\nOn the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.\"\r\n          Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"                                    60\r\n\r\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\r\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,\r\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\r\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore\r\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore                       65\r\n          Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"\r\n\r\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\r\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;\r\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\r\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore,                    70\r\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\r\n          Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\r\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\r\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining                  75\r\nOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,\r\nBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er\r\n          _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\r\n\r\nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\r\nSwung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.               80\r\n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee\r\nRespite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!\r\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!\"\r\n          Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil!           85\r\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\r\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--\r\nOn this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore:\r\nIs there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"\r\n          Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"                                       90\r\n\r\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!\r\nBy that Heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore,\r\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\r\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore:\r\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"                 95\r\n          Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked, upstarting:\r\n\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\r\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\r\nLeave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door!                   100\r\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\r\n          Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\r\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\r\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,             105\r\nAnd the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor:\r\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n          Shall be lifted--nevermore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEULALIE\r\n\r\n\r\nI dwelt alone\r\nIn a world of moan,\r\nAnd my soul was a stagnant tide,\r\nTill the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride,\r\nTill the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.                  5\r\n\r\nAh, less--less bright\r\nThe stars of the night\r\nThan the eyes of the radiant girl!\r\nAnd never a flake\r\nThat the vapor can make                                                       10\r\nWith the moon-tints of purple and pearl\r\nCan vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curl,\r\nCan compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie's most humble and careless curl.\r\n\r\nNow doubt--now pain\r\nCome never again,                                                             15\r\nFor her soul gives me sigh for sigh;\r\nAnd all day long\r\nShines, bright and strong,\r\nAstarte within the sky,\r\nWhile ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye,                        20\r\nWhile ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M.L.S--\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all who hail thy presence as the morning;\r\nOf all to whom thine absence is the night,\r\nThe blotting utterly from out high heaven\r\nThe sacred sun; of all who, weeping, bless thee\r\nHourly for hope, for life, ah! above all,                   5\r\nFor the resurrection of deep-buried faith\r\nIn truth, in virtue, in humanity;\r\nOf all who, on despair's unhallowed bed\r\nLying down to die, have suddenly arisen\r\nAt thy soft-murmured words, \"Let there be light!\"          10\r\nAt the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled\r\nIn the seraphic glancing of thine eyes;\r\nOf all who owe thee most, whose gratitude\r\nNearest resembles worship, oh, remember\r\nThe truest, the most fervently devoted,                    15\r\nAnd think that these weak lines are written by him:\r\nBy him, who, as he pens them, thrills to think\r\nHis spirit is communing with an angel's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nULALUME\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skies they were ashen and sober;\r\n  The leaves they were crispéd and sere,\r\n  The leaves they were withering and sere;\r\nIt was night in the lonesome October\r\n  Of my most immemorial year;                               5\r\nIt was hard by the dim lake of Auber,\r\n  In the misty mid region of Weir:\r\nIt was down by the dank tarn of Auber,\r\n  In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\r\n\r\nHere once, through an alley Titanic                        10\r\n  Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--\r\n  Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.\r\nThese were days when my heart was volcanic\r\n  As the scoriac rivers that roll,\r\n  As the lavas that restlessly roll                        15\r\nTheir sulphurous currents down Yaanek\r\n  In the ultimate climes of the pole,\r\nThat groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek\r\n  In the realms of the boreal pole.\r\n\r\nOur talk had been serious and sober,                       20\r\n  But our thoughts they were palsied and sere,\r\n  Our memories were treacherous and sere,\r\nFor we knew not the month was October,\r\n  And we marked not the night of the year,\r\n  (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)                   25\r\nWe noted not the dim lake of Auber\r\n  (Though once we had journeyed down here),\r\nRemembered not the dank tarn of Auber\r\n  Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the night was senescent                        30\r\n  And star-dials pointed to morn,\r\n  As the star-dials hinted of morn,\r\nAt the end of our path a liquescent\r\n  And nebulous lustre was born,\r\nOut of which a miraculous crescent                         35\r\n  Arose with a duplicate horn,\r\nAstarte's bediamonded crescent\r\n  Distinct with its duplicate horn.\r\n\r\nAnd I said--\"She is warmer than Dian:\r\n  She rolls through an ether of sighs,                     40\r\n  She revels in a region of sighs:\r\nShe has seen that the tears are not dry on\r\n  These cheeks, where the worm never dies,\r\nAnd has come past the stars of the Lion\r\n  To point us the path to the skies,                       45\r\n  To the Lethean peace of the skies:\r\nCome up, in despite of the Lion,\r\n  To shine on us with her bright eyes:\r\nCome up through the lair of the Lion,\r\n  With love in her luminous eyes.\"                         50\r\n\r\nBut Psyche, uplifting her finger,\r\n  Said--\"Sadly this star I mistrust:\r\n  Her pallor I strangely mistrust:\r\nOh, hasten!--oh, let us not linger!\r\n  Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.\"                     55\r\nIn terror she spoke, letting sink her\r\n  Wings until they trailed in the dust;\r\nIn agony sobbed, letting sink her\r\n  Plumes till they trailed in the dust,\r\n  Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.               60\r\n\r\nI replied--\"This is nothing but dreaming:\r\n  Let us on by this tremulous light!\r\n  Let us bathe in this crystalline light!\r\nIts sibyllic splendor is beaming\r\n  With hope and in beauty to-night:                        65\r\n  See, it flickers up the sky through the night!\r\nAh, we safely may trust to its gleaming,\r\n  And be sure it will lead us aright:\r\nWe safely may trust to a gleaming\r\n  That cannot but guide us aright,                         70\r\n  Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.\"\r\n\r\nThus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,\r\n  And tempted her out of her gloom,\r\n  And conquered her scruples and gloom;\r\nAnd we passed to the end of the vista,                     75\r\n  But were stopped by the door of a tomb,\r\n  By the door of a legended tomb;\r\nAnd I said--\"What is written, sweet sister,\r\n  On the door of this legended tomb?\"\r\n  She replied--\"Ulalume--Ulalume--                         80\r\n  'T is the vault of thy lost Ulalume!\"\r\n\r\nThen my heart it grew ashen and sober\r\n  As the leaves that were crisped and sere,\r\n  As the leaves that were withering and sere,\r\nAnd I cried--\"It was surely October                        85\r\n  On this very night of last year\r\n  That I journeyed--I journeyed down here,\r\n  That I brought a dread burden down here:\r\n  On this night of all nights in the year,\r\n  Ah, what demon has tempted me here?                      90\r\nWell I know, now, this dim lake of Auber,\r\n  This misty mid region of Weir:\r\nWell I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,\r\n  This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long ago the writer of these lines,\r\nIn the mad pride of intellectuality,\r\nMaintained \"the power of words\"--denied that ever\r\nA thought arose within the human brain\r\nBeyond the utterance of the human tongue:                   5\r\nAnd now, as if in mockery of that boast,\r\nTwo words, two foreign soft dissyllables,\r\nItalian tones, made only to be murmured\r\nBy angels dreaming in the moonlit \"dew\r\nThat hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,\"           10\r\nHave

\"the sweetest voice of all God's creatures\"),     15\r\nCould hope to utter. And I--my spells are broken;\r\nThe pen falls powerless from my shivering hand;\r\nWith thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,\r\nI cannot write--I cannot speak or think--\r\nAlas, I cannot feel; for't is not feeling,--               20\r\nThis standing motionless upon the golden\r\nThreshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,\r\nGazing entranced adown the gorgeous vista,\r\nAnd thrilling as I see, upon the right,\r\nUpon the left, and all the way along,                      25\r\nAmid empurpled vapors, far away\r\nTo where the prospect terminates--thee only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ENIGMA\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Seldom we find,\" says Solomon Don Dunce,\r\n  \"Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.\r\nThrough all the flimsy things we see at once\r\n  As easily as through a Naples bonnet--\r\n  Trash of all trash! how can a lady don it?                5\r\nYet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff,\r\nOwl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff\r\n  Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it.\"\r\nAnd, veritably, Sol is right enough.\r\nThe general tuckermanities are arrant                      10\r\nBubbles, ephemeral and _so_ transparent;\r\n  But _this_ is, now, you may depend upon it,\r\nStable, opaque, immortal--all by dint\r\nOf the dear names that lie concealed within 't.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HELEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw thee once--once only--years ago:\r\nI must not say how many--but not many.\r\nIt was a July midnight; and from out\r\nA full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring\r\nSought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,             5\r\nThere fell a silvery-silken veil of light,\r\nWith quietude and sultriness and slumber,\r\nUpon the upturned faces of a thousand\r\nRoses that grew in an enchanted garden,\r\nWhere no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe:             10\r\nFell on the upturned faces of these roses\r\nThat gave out, in return for the love-light,\r\nTheir odorous souls in an ecstatic death:\r\nFell on the upturned faces of these roses\r\nThat smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted           15\r\nBy thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.\r\n\r\nClad all in white, upon a violet bank\r\nI saw thee half reclining; while the moon\r\nFell on the upturned faces of the roses,\r\nAnd on thine own, upturned--alas, in sorrow!               20\r\n\r\nWas it not Fate, that, on this July midnight--\r\nWas it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow)\r\nThat bade me pause before that garden-gate\r\nTo breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?\r\nNo footsteps stirred: the hated world all slept,           25\r\nSave only thee and me--O Heaven! O God!\r\nHow my heart beats in coupling those two words!--\r\nSave only thee and me. I paused, I looked,\r\nAnd in an instant all things disappeared.\r\n(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)              30\r\nThe pearly lustre of the moon went out:\r\n\r\nThe mossy banks and the meandering paths,\r\nThe happy flowers and the repining trees,\r\nWere seen no more: the very roses' odors\r\nDied in the arms of the adoring airs.                      35\r\nAll, all expired save thee--save less than thou:\r\nSave only the divine light in thine eyes,\r\nSave but the soul in thine uplifted eyes:\r\nI saw but them--they were the world to me:\r\nI saw but them, saw only them for hours,                   40\r\nSaw only them until the moon went down.\r\nWhat wild heart-histories seem to lie enwritten\r\nUpon those crystalline, celestial spheres;\r\nHow dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope;\r\nHow silently serene a sea of pride;                        45\r\nHow daring an ambition; yet how deep,\r\nHow fathomless a capacity for love!\r\n\r\nBut now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,\r\nInto a western couch of thunder-cloud;\r\nAnd thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees                50\r\nDidst glide away. Only thine eyes remained:\r\nThey would not go--they never yet have gone;\r\nLighting my lonely pathway home that night,\r\nThey have not left me (as my hopes have) since;\r\nThey follow me--they lead me through the years;            55\r\nThey are my ministers--yet I their slave;\r\nTheir office is to illumine and enkindle--\r\nMy duty, to be saved by their bright light,\r\nAnd purified in their electric fire,\r\nAnd sanctified in their elysian fire,                      60\r\nThey fill my soul with beauty (which is hope),\r\nAnd are, far up in heaven, the stars I kneel to\r\nIn the sad, silent watches of my night;\r\nWhile even in the meridian glare of day\r\nI see them still--two sweetly scintillant                  65\r\nVenuses, unextinguished by the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VALENTINE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,\r\n  Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,\r\nShall find her own sweet name, that nestling lies\r\n  Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.\r\nSearch narrowly the lines! they hold a treasure                                5\r\n  Divine, a talisman, an amulet\r\nThat must be worn at heart.

                                   5\r\nWhile the stars, that oversprinkle\r\nAll the heavens, seem to twinkle\r\nWith a crystalline deligit;\r\nKeeping time, time, time,\r\nIn a sort of Runic rhyme,                                  10\r\nTo the tintinnabulation that so musically wells\r\nFrom the bells, bells, bells, bells,\r\nBells, bells, bells--\r\nFrom the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHear the mellow wedding bells,                             15\r\nGolden bells!\r\nWhat a world of happiness their harmony foretells!\r\nThrough the balmy air of night\r\nHow they ring out their delight!\r\nFrom the molten-golden notes,                              20\r\nAnd all in tune,\r\nWhat a liquid ditty floats\r\nTo the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats\r\nOn the moon!\r\nOh, from out the sounding cells,                           25\r\nWhat a gush of euphony voluminously wells!\r\nHow it swells!\r\nHow it dwells\r\nOn the Future! how it tells\r\nOf the rapture that impels                                 30\r\nTo the swinging and the ringing\r\nOf the bells, bells, bells,\r\nOf the bells, bells, bells, bells,\r\nBells, bells, bells--\r\nTo the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!

                       40\r\nToo much horrified to speak,\r\nThey can only shriek, shriek,\r\nOut of tune,\r\nIn a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,\r\nIn a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,     45\r\nLeaping higher, higher, higher,\r\nWith a desperate desire,\r\nAnd a resolute endeavor\r\nNow--now to sit or never,\r\nBy the side of the pale-faced moon.                        50\r\nOh, the bells, bells, bells!\r\nWhat a tale their terror tells\r\nOf Despair!\r\nHow they clang, and clash, and roar!\r\nWhat a horror they outpour                                 55\r\nOn the bosom of the palpitating air!\r\nYet the ear it fully knows,\r\nBy the twanging\r\nAnd the clanging,\r\nHow the danger ebbs and flows;                             60\r\nYet the ear distinctly tells,\r\nIn the jangling\r\nAnd the wrangling,\r\nHow the danger sinks and swells,--\r\nBy the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells,  65\r\nOf the bells,\r\nOf the bells, bells, bells, bells,\r\nBells, bells, bells--\r\nIn the clamor and the clangor of the bells!\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nHear the tolling of the bells,                             70\r\nIron bells!\r\nWhat a world of solemn thought their monody compels!\r\nIn the silence of the night\r\nHow we shiver with affright\r\nAt the melancholy menace of their tone!                    75\r\nFor every sound that floats\r\nFrom the rust within their throats\r\nIs a groan.\r\nAnd the people--ah, the people,\r\nThey that dwell up in the steeple,                         80\r\nAll alone,\r\nAnd who tolling, tolling, tolling\r\nIn that muffled monotone,\r\nFeel a glory in so rolling\r\nOn the human heart a stone--                               85\r\nThey are neither man nor woman,\r\nThey are neither brute nor human,\r\nThey are Ghouls:\r\nAnd their king it is who tolls;\r\nAnd he rolls, rolls, rolls,                                90\r\nRolls\r\nA pæan from the bells;\r\nAnd his merry bosom swells\r\nWith the pæan of the bells,\r\nAnd he dances, and he yells:                               95\r\nKeeping time, time, time,\r\nIn a sort of Runic rhyme,\r\nTo the pæan of the bells,\r\nOf the bells:\r\nKeeping time, time, time,                                 100\r\nIn a sort of Runic rhyme,\r\n  To the throbbing of the bells,\r\nOf the bells, bells, bells--\r\n  To the sobbing of the bells;\r\nKeeping time, time, time,                                 105\r\n  As he knells, knells, knells,\r\nIn a happy Runic rhyme,\r\n  To the rolling of the bells,\r\nOf the bells, bells, bells:\r\n  To the tolling of the bells,                            110\r\nOf the bells, bells, bells, bells,\r\n    Bells, bells, bells--\r\nTo the moaning and the groaning of the bells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNABEL LEE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was many and many a year ago,\r\n  In a kingdom by the sea,\r\nThat a maiden there lived whom you may know\r\n  By the name of Annabel Lee;\r\nAnd this maiden she lived with no other thought             5\r\n  Than to love and be loved by me.\r\n\r\nI was a child and she was a child,\r\n  In this kingdom by the sea,\r\nBut we loved with a love that was more than love,\r\n  I and my Annabel Lee;                                    10\r\nWith a love that the winged seraphs of heaven\r\n  Coveted her and me.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the reason that, long ago,\r\n  In this kingdom by the sea,\r\nA wind blew out of a cloud, chilling                       15\r\n  My beautiful Annabel Lee;\r\nSo that her highborn kinsmen came\r\n  And bore her away from me,\r\nTo shut her up in a sepulchre\r\n  In this kingdom by the sea.                              20\r\n\r\nThe angels, not half so happy in heaven,\r\n  Went envying her and me;\r\nYes! that was the reason (as all men know,\r\n  In this kingdom by the sea)\r\nThat the wind came out of the cloud by night,              25\r\n  Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.\r\n\r\nBut our love it was stronger by far than the love\r\n  Of those who were older than we,\r\n  Of many far wiser than we;\r\nAnd neither the angels in heaven above,                    30\r\n  Nor the demons down under the sea,\r\nCan ever dissever my soul from the soul\r\n  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:\r\n\r\nFor the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams\r\n  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;                            35\r\nAnd the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes\r\n  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\r\nAnd so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\r\nOf my darling--my darling--my life and my bride,\r\n  In her sepulchre there by the sea,                       40\r\n  In her tomb by the sounding sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MY MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause I feel that, in the Heavens above,\r\n  The angels, whispering to one another,\r\nCan find among their burning terms of love--\r\n  None so devotional as that of \"Mother,\"\r\nTherefore by that dear name I long have called you--        5\r\n  You who are more than mother unto me,\r\nAnd fill my heart of hearts where Death installed you\r\n  In setting my Virginia's spirit free.\r\nMy mother, my own mother, who died early,\r\n  Was but the mother of myself; but you                    10\r\nAre mother to the one I loved so dearly,\r\n  And thus are dearer than the mother I knew\r\nBy that infinity with which my wife\r\nWas dearer to my soul than its soul-life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELDORADO\r\n\r\n\r\nGayly bedight,\r\nA gallant knight,\r\nIn sunshine and in shadow,\r\nHad journeyed long,\r\nSinging a song,                                             5\r\nIn search of Eldorado.\r\n\r\nBut he grew old,\r\nThis knight so bold,\r\nAnd o'er his heart a shadow\r\nFell as he found                                           10\r\nNo spot of ground\r\nThat looked like Eldorado.\r\n\r\nAnd, as his strength\r\nFailed him at length,\r\nHe met a pilgrim shadow:                                   15\r\n\"Shadow,\" said he,\r\n\"Where can it be,\r\nThis land of Eldorado?\"\r\n\r\n\"Over the Mountains\r\nOf the Moon,                                               20\r\nDown the Valley of the Shadow,\r\nRide, boldly ride,\"\r\nThe shade replied,\r\n\"If you seek for Eldorado!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER\r\n\r\n  Son coeur est un luth suspendu;\r\n  Sitôt qu'on le touche il résonne.\r\n                           Béranger\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of\r\nthe year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had\r\nbeen passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of\r\ncountry; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew\r\non, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it\r\nwas--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of\r\ninsufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the\r\nfeeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because\r\npoetic, sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the\r\nsternest natural images of the desolate or terrible.  I looked upon\r\nthe scene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape\r\nfeatures of the domain, upon the bleak walls, upon the vacant eye-like\r\nwindows, upon a few rank sedges, and upon a few white trunks of\r\ndecayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to\r\nno earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the\r\nreveller upon opium: the bitter lapse into everyday life, the hideous\r\ndropping off of the veil.  There was an iciness, a sinking, a\r\nsickening of the heart, an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no\r\ngoading of the imagination could torture into aught of the\r\nsublime. What was it--I paused to think--what was it that so unnerved\r\nme in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all\r\ninsoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded\r\nupon me as I pondered.  I was forced to fall back upon the\r\nunsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there _are_\r\ncombinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of\r\nthus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among\r\nconsiderations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a\r\nmere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the\r\ndetails of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to\r\nannihilate, its capacity for sorrowful impression; and acting upon\r\nthis idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and\r\nlurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed\r\ndown--but with a shudder even more thrilling than before--upon the\r\nremodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly\r\ntree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a\r\nsojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of\r\nmy boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our\r\nlast meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant\r\npart of the country--a letter from him--which in its wildly\r\ninportunate nature had admitted of no other than a personal reply.\r\nThe MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute\r\nbodily illness, of a mental disorder which oppressed him, and of an\r\nearnest desire to see me, as his best and indeed his only personal\r\nfriend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society,\r\nsome alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this,\r\nand much more, was said--it was the apparent _heart_ that went\r\nwith his request--which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I\r\naccordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\nAlthough as boys we had been even intimate associates, yet I really\r\nknew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and\r\nhabitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been\r\nnoted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament,\r\ndisplaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art,\r\nand manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive\r\ncharity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies,\r\nperhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable\r\nbeauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable\r\nfact that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had\r\nput forth at no period any enduring branch; in other words, that the\r\nentire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with\r\nvery trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this\r\ndeficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect\r\nkeeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character\r\nof the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which\r\nthe one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the\r\nother--it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the\r\nconsequent undeviating transmission from sire to son of the patrimony\r\nwith the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge\r\nthe original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal\r\nappellation of the \"House of Usher\"--an appellation which seemed to\r\ninclude, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family\r\nand the family mansion.\r\n\r\nI have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment,\r\nthat of looking down within the tarn, had been to deepen the first\r\nsingular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of\r\nthe rapid increase of my superstition--for why should I not so term\r\nit?--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have\r\nlong known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as\r\na basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I\r\nagain uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the\r\npool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous,\r\nindeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the\r\nsensations which oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as\r\nreally to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung\r\nan atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity: an\r\natmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had\r\nreeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent\r\ntarn: a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly\r\ndiscernible, and leaden-hued.\r\n\r\nShaking off from my spirit what _must_ have been a dream, I\r\nscanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal\r\nfeature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.  The\r\ndiscoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread the\r\nwhole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet\r\nall this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of\r\nthe masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency\r\nbetween its still perfect adaptation of parts and the crumbling\r\ncondition of the individual stones. In this there was much that\r\nreminded one of the specious totality of old wood-work which has\r\nrotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance\r\nfrom the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of\r\nextensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of\r\ninstability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have\r\ndiscovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the\r\nroof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag\r\ndirection, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.\r\n\r\nNoticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A\r\nservant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of\r\nthe hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence,\r\nthrough many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio\r\nof his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know\r\nnot how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already\r\nspoken. While the objects around me--while the carvings of the\r\nceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of\r\nthe floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as\r\nI strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been\r\naccustomed from my infancy--while I hesitated not to acknowledge how\r\nfamiliar was all this--I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were\r\nthe fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the\r\nstaircases, I met the physician of the family. His countenance, I\r\nthought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity.  He\r\naccosted me with trepidation and passed on.  The valet now threw open\r\na door and ushered me into the presence of his master.\r\n\r\nThe room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.  The\r\nwindows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from\r\nthe black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from\r\nwithin. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the\r\ntrellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more\r\nprominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach\r\nthe remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and\r\nfretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general\r\nfurniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books\r\nand musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any\r\nvitality to the scene. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of\r\nsorrow. An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and\r\npervaded all.\r\n\r\nUpon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying\r\nat full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much\r\nin it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality--of the\r\nconstrained effort of the _ennuyé_ man of the world. A glance,\r\nhowever, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We\r\nsat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him\r\nwith a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely man had never before\r\nso terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It\r\nwas with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of\r\nthe wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet\r\nthe character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A\r\ncadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous\r\nbeyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a\r\nsurpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but\r\nwith a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely\r\nmoulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral\r\nenergy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these\r\nfeatures, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the\r\ntemple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nAnd now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these\r\nfeatures, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much\r\nof change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of\r\nthe skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things\r\nstartled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to\r\ngrow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated\r\nrather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort,\r\nconnect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\r\n\r\nIn the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence,\r\nan inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of\r\nfeeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy, an\r\nexcessive nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed\r\nbeen prepared, no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain\r\nboyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical\r\nconformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and\r\nsullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the\r\nanimal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of\r\nenergetic concision--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and\r\nhollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly\r\nmodulated guttural utterance--which may be observed in the lost\r\ndrunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of\r\nhis most intense excitement.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest\r\ndesire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He\r\nentered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of\r\nhis malady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and\r\none for which he despaired to find a remedy--a mere nervous affection,\r\nhe immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It\r\ndisplayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as\r\nhe detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the\r\nterms and the general manner of the narration had their weight. He\r\nsuffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid\r\nfood was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain\r\ntexture; the odors of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were\r\ntortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds,\r\nand these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nTo an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. \"I\r\nshall perish,\" said he, \"I _must_ perish in this deplorable\r\nfolly. Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the\r\nevents of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I\r\nshudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which\r\nmay operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed,\r\nno abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect--in terror. In\r\nthis unnerved--in this pitiable condition, I feel that the period will\r\nsooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together,\r\nin some struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR.\"\r\n\r\nI learned moreover at intervals, and through broken and equivocal\r\nhints, another singular feature of his mental condition.  He was\r\nenchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the\r\ndwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never\r\nventured forth--in regard to an influence whose supposititious force\r\nwas conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated--an influence\r\nwhich some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family\r\nmansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his\r\nspirit--an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets,\r\nand of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length,\r\nbrought about upon the morale of his existence.\r\n\r\nHe admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the\r\npeculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more\r\nnatural and far more palpable origin--to the severe and long-continued\r\nillness, indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution, of a\r\ntenderly beloved sister--his sole companion for long years, his last\r\nand only relative on earth. \"Her decease,\" he said, with a bitterness\r\nwhich I can never forget, \"would leave him (him the hopeless and the\r\nfrail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers.\" While he spoke,\r\nthe lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a\r\nremote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my\r\npresence, disappeared. I regarded her with an utter astonishment not\r\nunmingled with dread, and yet I found it impossible to account for\r\nsuch feelings. A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed\r\nher retreating steps.  When a door, at length, closed upon her, my\r\nglance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the\r\nbrother; but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only\r\nperceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the\r\nemaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.\r\n\r\nThe disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her\r\nphysicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person,\r\nand frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical\r\ncharacter, were the unusual diagnosis.  Hitherto she had steadily\r\nborne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken\r\nherself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my\r\narrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night\r\nwith inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the\r\ndestroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person\r\nwould thus probably be the last I should obtain--that the lady, at\r\nleast while living, would be seen by me no more.\r\n\r\nFor several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or\r\nmyself; and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to\r\nalleviate the melancholy of my friend.  We painted and read together;\r\nor I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his\r\nspeaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy\r\nadmitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the\r\nmore bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a\r\nmind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured\r\nforth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one\r\nunceasing radiation of gloom.\r\n\r\nI shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus\r\nspent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail\r\nin any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the\r\nstudies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the\r\nway. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous\r\nlustre over all.  His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my\r\nears.  Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular\r\nperversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von\r\nWeber. From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and\r\nwhich grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the\r\nmore thrillingly because I shuddered knowing not why;--from these\r\npaintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain\r\nendeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within\r\nthe compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity, by the\r\nnakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention.  If ever\r\nmortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at\r\nleast, in the circumstances then surrounding me, there arose, out of\r\nthe pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon\r\nhis canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I\r\never yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too\r\nconcrete reveries of Fuseli.\r\n\r\nOne of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so\r\nrigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although\r\nfeebly, in words.  A small picture presented the interior of an\r\nimmensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls,\r\nsmooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain accessory\r\npoints of the design served well to convey the idea that this\r\nexcavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the\r\nearth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and\r\nno torch or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a\r\nflood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a\r\nghastly and inappropriate splendor.\r\n\r\nI have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve\r\nwhich rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the\r\nexception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps,\r\nthe narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar,\r\nwhich gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his\r\nperformances. But the fervid _facility_ of his impromptus could\r\nnot be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes,\r\nas well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently\r\naccompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of\r\nthat intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have\r\npreviously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the\r\nhighest artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I\r\nhave easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed\r\nwith it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its\r\nmeaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full\r\nconsciousness, on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty\r\nreason upon her throne.  The verses, which were entitled \"The Haunted\r\nPalace,\" ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIn the greenest of our valleys\r\n  By good angels tenanted,\r\nOnce a fair and stately palace--\r\n  Radiant palace--reared its head.\r\nIn the monarch Thought's dominion,\r\n  It stood there;\r\nNever seraph spread a pinion\r\n  Over fabric half so fair.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBanners yellow, glorious, golden,\r\n  On its roof did float and flow,\r\n(This--all this--was in the olden\r\n  Time long ago)\r\nAnd every gentle air that dallied,\r\n  In that sweet day,\r\nAlong the ramparts plumed and pallid,\r\n  A wingéd odor went away.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWanderers in that happy valley\r\n  Through two luminous windows saw\r\nSpirits moving musically\r\n  To a lute's well-tunéd law,\r\nRound about a throne where, sitting,\r\n  Porphyrogene,\r\nIn state his glory well befitting,\r\n  The ruler of the realm was seen.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAnd all with pearl and ruby glowing\r\n  Was the fair palace door,\r\nThrough which came flowing, flowing, flowing,\r\n  And sparkling evermore,\r\nA troop of Echoes whose sweet duty\r\n  Was but to sing,\r\nIn voices of surpassing beauty,\r\n  The wit and wisdom of their king.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBut evil things, in robes of sorrow,\r\n  Assailed the monarch's high estate;\r\n(Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow\r\n  Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)\r\nAnd round about his home the glory\r\n  That blushed and bloomed\r\nIs but a dim-remembered story\r\n  Of the old time entombed.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAnd travellers now within that valley\r\n  Through the red-litten windows see\r\nVast forms that move fantastically\r\n  To a discordant melody;\r\nWhile, like a ghastly rapid river,\r\n  Through the pale door\r\nA hideous throng rush out forever,\r\n  And laugh--but smile no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nI well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into\r\na train of thought, wherein there became manifest an opinion of\r\nUsher's which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for\r\nother men[1] haye thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with\r\nwhich he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of\r\nthe sentience of all vegetable things. But in his disordered fancy the\r\nidea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under\r\ncertain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words\r\nto express the full extent, or the earnest _abandon_ of his\r\npersuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously\r\nhinted) with the gray stones of the home of his fore-fathers. The\r\nconditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in\r\nthe method of collocation of these stones--in the order of their\r\narrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread\r\nthem, and of the decayed trees which stood around--above all, in the\r\nlong undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its\r\nreduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence--the\r\nevidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he said (and I here started\r\nas he spoke), in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere\r\nof their own about the waters and the walls. The result was\r\ndiscoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible\r\ninfluence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family,\r\nand which made _him_ what I now saw him--what he was. Such\r\nopinions need no comment, and I will make none.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the\r\nBishop of Landaff.--See \"Chemical Essays,\" Vol. V.]\r\n\r\nOur books--the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of\r\nthe mental existence of the invalid--were, as might be supposed, in\r\nstrict keeping with this character of phantasm. We pored together over\r\nsuch works as the Ververt and Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of\r\nMachiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean\r\nVoyage of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of\r\nJean D'Indaginé, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue\r\nDistance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite\r\nvolume was a small octavo edition of the _Directorium\r\nInquisitorum_, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were\r\npassages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and Ægipans,\r\nover which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight,\r\nhowever, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious\r\nbook in quarto Gothic--the manual of a forgotten church--the\r\n_Vigilice Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiæ Maguntinæ_.\r\n\r\nI could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its\r\nprobable influence upon the hypochondriac, when one evening, having\r\ninformed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his\r\nintention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its\r\nfinal interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls\r\nof the building.  The worldly reason, however, assigned for this\r\nsingular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to\r\ndispute.  The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me)\r\nby consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the\r\ndeceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her\r\nmedical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the\r\nburial-ground of the family. I will not deny that when I called to\r\nmind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the\r\nstaircase, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to\r\noppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an\r\nunnatural, precaution.\r\n\r\nAt the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements\r\nfor the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two\r\nalone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which\r\nhad been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its\r\noppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation)\r\nwas small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light;\r\nlying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the\r\nbuilding in which was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used,\r\napparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a\r\ndonjon-keep, and in later days as a place of deposit for powder, or\r\nsome other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor,\r\nand the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it,\r\nwere carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had\r\nbeen, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an\r\nunusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.\r\n\r\nHaving deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region\r\nof horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the\r\ncoffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude\r\nbetween the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and\r\nUsher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words\r\nfrom which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and\r\nthat sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed\r\nbetween them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for\r\nwe could not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed\r\nthe lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies\r\nof a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush\r\nupon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile\r\nupon the lip which is so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed\r\ndown the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with\r\ntoil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nAnd now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable\r\nchange came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His\r\nordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected\r\nor forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal,\r\nand objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if\r\npossible, a more ghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had\r\nutterly gone out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard\r\nno more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually\r\ncharacterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought\r\nhis unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive\r\nsecret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. At\r\ntimes, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable\r\nvagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long\r\nhours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to\r\nsome imaginary sound. It was no wonder that his condition\r\nterrified--that it infected me. I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet\r\ncertain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet\r\nimpressive superstitions.\r\n\r\nIt was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the\r\nseventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within\r\nthe donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep\r\ncame not near my couch, while the hours waned and waned away. I\r\nstruggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I\r\nendeavored to believe that much, if not all, of what I felt was due to\r\nthe bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room--of the\r\ndark and tattered draperies which, tortured into motion by the breath\r\nof a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and\r\nrustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were\r\nfruitless. An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and at\r\nlength there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless\r\nalarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself\r\nupon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness\r\nof the chamber, hearkened--I know not why, except that an instinctive\r\nspirit prompted me--to certain low and indefinite sounds which came,\r\nthrough the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not\r\nwhence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable\r\nyet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste, (for I felt that I\r\nshould sleep no more during the night,) and endeavored to arouse\r\nmyself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing\r\nrapidly to and fro through the apartment.\r\n\r\nI had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an\r\nadjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognized it\r\nas that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped with a gentle\r\ntouch at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as\r\nusual, cadaverously wan--but, moreover, there was a species of mad\r\nhilarity in his eyes--an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole\r\ndemeanor. His air appalled me--but anything was preferable to the\r\nsolitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence\r\nas a relief.\r\n\r\n\"And you have not seen it?\" he said abruptly, after having stared\r\nabout him for some moments in silence--\"you have not then seen\r\nit?--but, stay! you shall.\" Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded\r\nhis lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open\r\nto the storm.\r\n\r\nThe impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our\r\nfeet. It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and\r\none wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had\r\napparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were\r\nfrequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the\r\nexceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon\r\nthe turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like\r\nvelocity with which they flew careering from all points against each\r\nother, without passing away into the distance. I say that even their\r\nexceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this; yet we had no\r\nglimpse of the moon or stars, nor was there any flashing forth of the\r\nlightning. But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated\r\nvapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were\r\nglowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly\r\nvisible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\n\"You must not--you shall not behold this!\" said I, shudderingly, to\r\nUsher, as I led him with a gentle violence from the window to a\r\nseat. \"These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical\r\nphenomena not uncommon--or it may be that they have their ghastly\r\norigin in the rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement; the\r\nair is chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your\r\nfavorite romances. I will read, and you shall listen;--and so we will\r\npass away this terrible night together.\"\r\n\r\nThe antique volume which I had taken up was the \"Mad Trist\" of Sir\r\nLauncelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher's more in\r\nsad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its\r\nuncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for\r\nthe lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the\r\nonly book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the\r\nexcitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief (for\r\nthe history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in\r\nthe extremeness of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged,\r\nindeed, by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he\r\nhearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might\r\nwell have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.\r\n\r\nI had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred,\r\nthe hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission\r\ninto the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by\r\nforce. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\"And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now\r\nmighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had\r\ndrunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in\r\nsooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain\r\nupon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted\r\nhis mace outright, and with blows made quickly room in the plankings\r\nof the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith\r\nsturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the\r\nnoise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated\r\nthroughout the forest.\"\r\n\r\nAt the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment\r\npaused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my\r\nexcited fancy had deceived me)--it appeared to me that from some very\r\nremote portion of the mansion there came, indistinctly, to my ears,\r\nwhat might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo\r\n(but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and\r\nripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It\r\nwas, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my\r\nattention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and\r\nthe ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the\r\nsound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or\r\ndisturbed me. I continued the story:--\r\n\r\n\"But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was\r\nsore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit;\r\nbut, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious\r\ndemeanor, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace\r\nof gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield\r\nof shining brass with this legend enwritten--\r\n\r\n  Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;\r\n  Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win.\r\n\r\nAnd Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the\r\ndragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a\r\nshriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had\r\nfain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of\r\nit, the like whereof was never before heard.\"\r\n\r\nHere again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild\r\namazement; for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this\r\ninstance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it\r\nproceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant,\r\nbut harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating\r\nsound--the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up\r\nfor the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.\r\n\r\nOppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and\r\nmost extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations,\r\nin which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained\r\nsufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the\r\nsensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that\r\nhe had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange\r\nalteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his\r\ndemeanor. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought\r\nround his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the\r\nchamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features,\r\nalthough I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring\r\ninaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast--yet I knew that he\r\nwas not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught\r\na glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at\r\nvariance with this idea--for he rocked from side to side with a gentle\r\nyet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all\r\nthis, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus\r\nproceeded:--\r\n\r\n\"And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the\r\ndragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking\r\nup of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out\r\nof the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver\r\npavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in\r\nsooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon\r\nthe silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if a shield of\r\nbrass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of\r\nsilver--I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic and clangorous,\r\nyet apparently muffled reverberation.  Completely unnerved, I leaped\r\nto my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was\r\nundisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent\r\nfixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned\r\na stony rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there\r\ncame a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered\r\nabout his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and\r\ngibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence.  Bending closely\r\nover him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words.\r\n\r\n\"Not hear it?--yes, I hear it, and _have_ heard it.\r\nLong--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard\r\nit--yet I dared not--oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!--I dared\r\nnot--I _dared_ not speak! _We have put her living in the\r\ntomb!_ Said I not that my senses were acute?  I _now_ tell you\r\nthat I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard\r\nthem--many, many days ago--yet I dared not--_I dared not speak!_\r\nAnd now--to-night--Ethelred--ha! ha!--the breaking of the hermit's\r\ndoor, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of the\r\nshield!--say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of\r\nthe iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered\r\narchway of the vault! Oh, whither shall I fly? Will she not be here\r\nanon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard\r\nher footstep on the stair? Do I not distinguish that heavy and\r\nhorrible beating of her heart?  Madman!\"--here he sprang furiously to\r\nhis feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were\r\ngiving up his soul--\"_Madman! I tell you that she now stands without\r\nthe door!_\"\r\n\r\nAs if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found\r\nthe potency of a spell, the huge antique panels to hich the speaker\r\npointed threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony\r\njaws. It was the work of the rushing gust--but then without those\r\ndoors there _did_ stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the\r\nlady Madeline of Usher.  There was blood upon her white robes, and the\r\nevidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated\r\nframe. For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon\r\nthe threshold--then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon\r\nthe person of her brother, and, in her violent and now final\r\ndeath-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the\r\nterrors he had anticipated.\r\n\r\nFrom that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast.  The storm\r\nwas still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old\r\ncauseway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I\r\nturned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the\r\nvast house and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that\r\nof the full, setting, and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly\r\nthrough that once barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before\r\nspoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag\r\ndirection, to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly\r\nwidened--there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind--the entire orb\r\nof the satellite burst at once upon my sight--my brain reeled as I saw\r\nthe mighty walls rushing asunder--there was a long tumultuous shouting\r\nsound like the voice of a thousand waters--and the deep and dank tarn\r\nat my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the\r\n\"_House of Usher_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WILSON\r\n\r\n  What say of it? what say of CONSCIENCE grim,\r\n  That spectre in my path?\r\n               CHAMBERLAYNE: _Pharronida_\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair page now\r\nlying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation. This has\r\nbeen already too much an object for the scorn--for the horror--for the\r\ndetestation of my race. To the uttermost regions of the globe have not\r\nthe indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of\r\nall outcasts most abandoned!--to the earth art thou not forever dead?\r\nto its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?--and a\r\ncloud, dense, dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally\r\nbetween thy hopes and heaven?\r\n\r\nI would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later\r\nyears of unspeakable misery and unpardonable crime.  This epoch, these\r\nlater years, took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude,\r\nwhose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually\r\ngrow base by degrees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped\r\nbodily as a mantle. From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed,\r\nwith the stride of a giant, into more than the enormities of an\r\nElah-Gabalus.  What chance--what one event brought this evil thing to\r\npass, bear with me while I relate. Death approaches; and the shadow\r\nwhich foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit. I\r\nlong, in passing through the dim valley, for the sympathy--I had\r\nnearly said for the pity--of my fellow-men. I would fain have them\r\nbelieve that I have been, in some measure, the slave of circumstances\r\nbeyond human control.  I would wish them to seek out for me, in the\r\ndetails I am about to give, some little oasis of _fatality_ amid a\r\nwilderness of error. I would have them allow--what they cannot refrain\r\nfrom allowing--that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as\r\ngreat, man was never _thus_, at least, tempted before--certainly,\r\nnever _thus_ fell. And is it therefore that he has never thus\r\nsuffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream? And am I not now\r\ndying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all\r\nsublunary visions?\r\n\r\nI am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable\r\ntemperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my\r\nearliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family\r\ncharacter. As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed;\r\nbecoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my\r\nfriends, and of positive injury to myself. I grew self-willed,\r\naddicted to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable\r\npassions.  Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin\r\nto my own, my parents could do but little to check the evil\r\npropensities which distinguished me. Some feeble and ill-directed\r\nefforts resulted in complete failure on their part, and, of course, in\r\ntotal triumph on mine. Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and\r\nat an age when few children have abandoned their leading-strings I was\r\nleft to the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the\r\nmaster of my own actions.\r\n\r\nMy earliest recollections of a school-life are connected with a large,\r\nrambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England,\r\nwhere were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all\r\nthe houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-like and\r\nspirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, in\r\nfancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed\r\navenues, inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill\r\nanew with undefinable delight at the deep hollow note of the\r\nchurch-bell, breaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon\r\nthe stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic\r\nsteeple lay imbedded and asleep.\r\n\r\nIt gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner\r\nexperience to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its\r\nconcerns. Steeped in misery as I am--misery, alas! only too real--I\r\nshall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in\r\nthe weakness of a few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly\r\ntrivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume to my fancy\r\nadventitious importance, as connected with a period and a locality\r\nwhen and where I recognize the first ambiguous monitions of the\r\ndestiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me. Let me then\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nThe house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were\r\nextensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of\r\nmortar and broken glass, encompassed the whole.  This prison-like\r\nrampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a\r\nweek--once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we\r\nwere permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the\r\nneighboring fields--and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in\r\nthe same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one\r\nchurch of the village. Of this church the principal of our school was\r\npastor. With how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to\r\nregard him from our remote pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn\r\nand slow, he ascended the pulpit! This reverend man, with countenance\r\nso demurely benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing,\r\nwith wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast,--could this be he\r\nwho, of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments,\r\nadministered, ferule in hand, the Draconian Laws of the academy? Oh,\r\ngigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!\r\n\r\nAt an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It\r\nwas riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged\r\niron spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! It was never\r\nopened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions\r\nalready mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found\r\na plenitude of mystery--a world of matter for solemn remark, or for\r\nmore solemn meditation.\r\n\r\nThe extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious\r\nrecesses. Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the\r\nplay-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well\r\nremember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within\r\nit. Of course it was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small\r\nparterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred\r\ndivision we passed only upon rare occasions indeed--such as a first\r\nadvent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps when, a parent\r\nor friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the\r\nChristmas or Midsummer holidays.\r\n\r\nBut the house--how quaint an old building was this!--to me how\r\nveritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its\r\nwindings--to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult, at\r\nany given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories\r\none happened to be. From each room to every other there were sure to\r\nbe found three or four steps either in ascent or descent. Then the\r\nlateral branches were innumerable, inconceivable, and so returning in\r\nupon themselves that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole\r\nmansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered\r\nupon infinity. During the five years of my residence here I was never\r\nable to ascertain, with precision, in what remote locality lay the\r\nlittle sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or\r\ntwenty other scholars.\r\n\r\nThe school-room was the largest in the house--I could not help\r\nthinking, in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low,\r\nwith pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and\r\nterror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet,\r\ncomprising the _sanctum_, \"during hours,\" of our principal, the\r\nReverend Dr. Bransby. It was a solid structure, with massy door,\r\nsooner than open which in the absence of the \"Dominie\" we would all\r\nhave willingly perished by the _peine forte et dure._ In other angles\r\nwere two other similar boxes, far less reverenced, indeed, but still\r\ngreatly matters of awe. One of these was the pulpit of the \"classical\"\r\nusher; one, of the \"English and mathematical.\"  Interspersed about the\r\nroom, crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity, were\r\ninnumerable benches and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled\r\ndesperately with much-be-thumbed books, and so beseamed with initial\r\nletters, names at full length, grotesque figures, and other multiplied\r\nefforts of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little of original\r\nform might have been their portion in days long departed. A huge\r\nbucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and a clock of\r\nstupendous dimensions at the other.\r\n\r\nEncompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed,\r\nyet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my\r\nlife. The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of\r\nincident to occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of\r\na school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth\r\nhas derived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must\r\nbelieve that my first mental development had in it much of the\r\nuncommon--even much of the _outré_. Upon mankind at large the events\r\nof very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite\r\nimpression. All is gray shadow--a weak and irregular remembrance--an\r\nindistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric\r\npains. With me this is not so. In childhood I must have felt, with the\r\nenergy of a man, what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as\r\nvivid, as deep, and as durable as the _exergues_ of the Carthaginian\r\nmedals.\r\n\r\nYet in fact--in the fact of the world's view--how little was there to\r\nremember! The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to bed; the\r\nconnings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and\r\nperambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its\r\nintrigues;--these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to\r\ninvolve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an\r\nuniverse of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and\r\nspirit-stirring.  \"_Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!_\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my\r\ndisposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates,\r\nand by slow but natural gradations gave me an ascendancy over all not\r\ngreatly older than myself: over all with a single exception. This\r\nexception was found in the person of a scholar who, although no\r\nrelation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself,--a\r\ncircumstance, in fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a noble\r\ndescent, mine was one of those every-day appellations which seem by\r\nprescriptive right to have been, time out of mind, the common property\r\nof the mob. In this narrative I have therefore designated myself as\r\nWilliam Wilson,--a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the\r\nreal. My namesake alone, of those who in school-phraseology\r\nconstituted \"our set,\" presumed to compete with me in the studies of\r\nthe class--in the sports and broils of the play-ground--to refuse\r\nimplicit belief in my assertions, and submission to my will--indeed,\r\nto interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever.\r\nIf there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the\r\ndespotism of a master-mind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits\r\nof its companions.\r\n\r\nWilson's rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment;\r\nthe more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in public I made a\r\npoint of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly felt that I\r\nfeared him, and could not help thinking the equality, which he\r\nmaintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority;\r\nsince not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle. Yet this\r\nsuperiority, even this equality, was in truth acknowledged by no one\r\nbut myself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed\r\nnot even to suspect it. Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and\r\nespecially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes,\r\nwere not more pointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike\r\nof the ambition which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind\r\nwhich enabled, me to excel. In his rivalry he might have been supposed\r\nactuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify\r\nmyself; although there were times when I could not help observing,\r\nwith a feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique, that he\r\nmingled with his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a\r\ncertain most inappropriate, and assuredly most unwelcome,\r\n_affectionateness_ of manner. I could only conceive this singular\r\nbehavior to arise from a consummate self-conceit assuming the vulgar\r\nairs of patronage and protection.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson's conduct, conjoined with\r\nour identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the\r\nschool upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were\r\nbrothers, among the senior classes in the academy. These do not\r\nusually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their\r\njuniors. I have before said, or should have said, that Wilson was not\r\nin the most remote degree connected with my family. But assuredly if\r\nwe _had_ been brothers we must have been twins; for, after leaving\r\nDr. Bransby's, I cassually learned that my namesake was born on the\r\nnineteenth of January, 1813; and this is a somewhat remarkable\r\ncoincidence; for the day is precisely that of my own nativity.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned\r\nme by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of\r\ncontradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We\r\nhad, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me\r\npublicly the palm of victory, he, in some manner, contrieved to make\r\nme feel that it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my\r\npart, and a veritable dignity on his own, kept us always upon what are\r\ncalled \"speaking terms,\" while there were many points of strong\r\ncongeniality in our tempers, operating to awake in me a sentiment\r\nwhich our position alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into\r\nfriendship. It is difficult, indeed, to define, or even to describe,\r\nmy real feelings towards him. They formed a motley and heterogeneous\r\nadmixture: some petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred, some\r\nesteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity. To\r\nthe moralist it will be unnecessary to say, in addition, that Wilson\r\nand myself were the most inseparable of companions.\r\n\r\nIt was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us\r\nwhich turned all my attacks upon him (and they were many, either open\r\nor covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain\r\nwhile assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious\r\nand determined hostility. But my endeavors on this head were by no\r\nmeans uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily\r\nconcocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that\r\nunassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of\r\nits own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely\r\nrefuses to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable\r\npoint, and that lying in a personal peculiarity arising, perhaps, from\r\nconstitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less\r\nat his wit's end than myself:--my rival had a weakness in the faucial\r\nor guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any\r\ntime _above a very low whisper_. Of this defect I did not fail to take\r\nwhat poor advantage lay in my power.\r\n\r\nWilson's retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of his\r\npractical wit that disturbed me beyond measure.  How his sagacity\r\nfirst discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a\r\nquestion I never could solve; but having discovered, he habitually\r\npractised the annoyance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly\r\npatronymic, and its very common, if not plebeian praenomen. The words\r\nwere venom in my ears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second\r\nWilliam Wilson came also to the academy, I felt angry with him for\r\nbearing the name, and doubly disgusted with the name because a\r\nstranger bore it, who would be the cause of its twofold repetition,\r\nwho would be constantly in my presence, and whose concerns, in the\r\nordinary routine of the school business, must inevitably, on account\r\nof the detestable coincidence, be often confounded with my own.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every\r\ncircumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between\r\nmy rival and myself. I had not then discovered the remarkable fact\r\nthat we were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same\r\nheight, and I perceived that we were even singularly alike in general\r\ncontour of person and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the\r\nrumor touching a relationship which had grown current in the upper\r\nforms.  In a word, nothing could more seriously disturb me (although I\r\nscrupulously concealed such disturbance) than any allusion to a\r\nsimilarity of mind, person, or condition existing between us. But, in\r\ntruth, I had no reason to believe that (with the exception of the\r\nmatter of relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself) this\r\nsimilarity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even observed\r\nat all by our schoolfellows. That _he_ observed it in all its\r\nbearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he could\r\ndiscover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance can\r\nonly be attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary\r\npenetration.\r\n\r\nHis cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in\r\nwords and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My\r\ndress it was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner were,\r\nwithout difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional\r\ndefect, even my voice did not escape him.  My louder tones were, of\r\ncourse, unattempted, but then the key,--it was identical; _and his\r\nsingular whisper,--it grew the very echo of my own._\r\n\r\nHow greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me (for it could\r\nnot justly be termed a caricature) I will not now venture to describe.\r\nI had but one consolation--in the fact that the imitation, apparently,\r\nwas noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing\r\nand strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied with\r\nhaving produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle\r\nin secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was\r\nuncharacteristically disregardful of the public applause which the\r\nsuccess of his witty endeavours might have so easily elicited.  That\r\nthe school, indeed, did not feel his design, perceive its\r\naccomplishment, and participate in his sneer, was, for many anxious\r\nmonths, a riddle I could not resolve. Perhaps the _gradation_ of his\r\ncopy rendered it not so readily perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed\r\nmy security to the masterly air of the copyist, who, disdaining the\r\nletter (which in a painting is all the obtuse can see) gave but the\r\nfull spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and\r\nchagrin.\r\n\r\nI have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of\r\npatronage which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious\r\ninterference with my will. This interference often took the ungracious\r\ncharacter of advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or\r\ninsinuated. I received it with a repugnance which gained strength as I\r\ngrew in years. Yet, at this distant day, let me do him the simple\r\njustice to acknowledge that I can recall no occasion when the\r\nsuggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so\r\nusual to his immature age and seeming inexperience; that his moral\r\nsense, at least, if not his general talents and worldly wisdom, was\r\nfar keener than my own; and that I might, to-day, have been a better,\r\nand thus a happier man, had I less frequently rejected the counsels\r\nembodied in those meaning whispers which I then but too cordially\r\nhated and too bitterly despised.\r\n\r\nAs it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his\r\ndistasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what\r\nI considered his intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in the first\r\nyears of our connection as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him\r\nmight have been easily ripened into friendship; but, in the latter\r\nmonths of my residence at the academy, although the intrusion of his\r\nordinary manner had, beyond doubt, in some measure abated, my\r\nsentiments, in nearly similar proportion, partook very much of\r\npositive hatred. Upon one occasion he saw this, I think, and\r\nafterwards avoided or made a show of avoiding me.\r\n\r\nIt was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an\r\naltercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually\r\nthrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor\r\nrather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered,\r\nin his accent, his air and general appearance, a something which first\r\nstartled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim\r\nvisions of my earliest infancy--wild, confused and thronging memories\r\nof a time when memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe\r\nthe sensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with\r\ndifficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the\r\nbeing who stood before me, at some epoch very long ago--some point of\r\nthe past even infinitely remote. The delusion, however, faded rapidly\r\nas it came; and I mention it at all but to define the day of the last\r\nconversation I there held with my singular namesake.\r\n\r\nThe huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several large\r\nchambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number\r\nof the students. There were, however (as must necessarily happen in a\r\nbuilding so awkwardly planned) many little nooks or recesses, the odds\r\nand ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr.\r\nBransby had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest\r\nclosets, they were capable of accommodating but a single\r\nindividual. One of these small apartments was occupied by Wilson.\r\n\r\nOne night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and\r\nimmediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one\r\nwrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a\r\nwilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my\r\nrival. I had long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of\r\npractical wit at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly\r\nunsuccessful. It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation,\r\nand I resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with\r\nwhich I was imbued. Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered,\r\nleaving the lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a\r\nstep, and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of\r\nhis being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again\r\napproached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which, in the\r\nprosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright\r\nrays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes at the same moment\r\nupon his countenance. I looked,--and a numbness, an iciness of\r\nfeeling, instantly pervaded my frame. My breast heaved, my knees\r\ntottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet\r\nintolerable horror. Gasping for breath, I lowered the lamp in still\r\nnearer proximity to the face. Were these,--_these_ the lineaments of\r\nWilliam Wilson? I saw, indeed, that they were his, but I shook as if\r\nwith a fit of the ague, in fancying they were not. What _was_ there\r\nabout them to confound me in this manner? I gazed,--while my brain\r\nreeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts. Not thus he\r\nappeared--assuredly not _thus_--in the vivacity of his waking\r\nhours. The same name! the same contour of person! the same day of\r\narrival at the academy! And then his dogged and meaningless imitation\r\nof my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! Was it, in truth,\r\nwithin the bounds of human possibility, that _what I now saw_ was the\r\nresult, merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation?\r\nAwe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp,\r\npassed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that\r\nold academy, never to enter them again.\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found\r\nmyself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been sufficient to\r\nenfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby's, or at least to\r\neffect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which I\r\nremembered them. The truth--the tragedy--of the drama was no more. I\r\ncould now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldom\r\ncalled up the subject at all but with wonder at the extent of human\r\ncredulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I\r\nhereditarily possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely\r\nto be diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The\r\nvortex of thoughtless folly, into which I there so immediately and so\r\nrecklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours,\r\nengulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory\r\nonly the veriest levities of a former existence.\r\n\r\nI do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy\r\nhere--a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded the\r\nvigilance, of the institution. Three years of folly, passed without\r\nprofit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a\r\nsomewhat unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of\r\nsoulless dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute\r\nstudents to a secret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour of\r\nthe night; for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until\r\nmorning. The wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and\r\nperhaps more dangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already\r\nfaintly appeared in the east while our delirious extravagance was at\r\nits height.  Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the\r\nact of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity, when my\r\nattention was suddenly diverted by the violent, although partial,\r\nunclosing of the door of the apartment, and by the eager voice of a\r\nservant from without. He said that some person, apparently in great\r\nhaste, demanded to speak with me in the hall.\r\n\r\nWildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delighted\r\nthan surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few steps\r\nbrought me to the vestibule of the building. In this low and small\r\nroom there hung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save\r\nthat of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the\r\nsemicircular window. As I put my foot over the threshold, I became\r\naware of the figure of a youth about my own height, and habited in a\r\nwhite kerseymere morning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I\r\nmyself wore at the moment. This the faint light enabled me to\r\nperceive; but the features of his face I could not distinguish. Upon\r\nmy entering, he strode hurriedly up to me, and, seizing me by the arm\r\nwith a gesture of petulant impatience, whispered the words \"William\r\nWilson!\" in my ear.\r\n\r\nI grew perfectly sober in an instant.\r\n\r\nThere was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the tremulous\r\nshake of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my eyes and the\r\nlight, which filled me with unqualified amazement; but it was not this\r\nwhich had so violently moved me. It was the pregnancy of solemn\r\nadmonition in the singular, low, hissing utterance; and, above all, it\r\nwas the character, the tone, _the key_, of those few, simple, and\r\nfamiliar, yet _whispered_ syllables, which came with a thousand\r\nthronging memories of by-gone days, and struck upon my soul with the\r\nshock of a galvanic battery. Ere I could recover the use of my senses\r\nhe was gone.\r\n\r\nAlthough this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered\r\nimagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, I\r\nbusied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid\r\nspeculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the\r\nidentity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered\r\nwith my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. But who\r\nand what was this Wilson?--and whence came he?--and what were his\r\npurposes? Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied--merely\r\nascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family\r\nhad caused his removal from Dr. Bransby's academy on the afternoon of\r\nthe day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief period I ceased\r\nto think upon the subject, my attention being all absorbed in a\r\ncontemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon went, the\r\nuncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and\r\nannual establishment which would enable me to indulge at will in the\r\nluxury already so dear to my hear--to vie in profuseness of\r\nexpenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nExcited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament\r\nbroke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common\r\nrestraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it were\r\nabsurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that\r\namong spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a\r\nmultitude of novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long\r\ncatalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIt could hardly be credited, however, that I had even here, so utterly\r\nfallen from the gentlemanly estate as to seek acquaintance with the\r\nvilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept\r\nin his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of\r\nincreasing my already enormous income at the expense of the\r\nweak-minded among my fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the\r\nfact. And the very enormity of this offence against all manly and\r\nhonorable sentiment proved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole\r\nreason of the impunity with which it was committed.  Who, indeed,\r\namong my most abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the\r\nclearest evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such courses\r\nthe gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson--the noblest and most\r\nliberal commoner at Oxford: him whose follies (said his parasites)\r\nwere but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy--whose errors but\r\ninimitable whim--whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing\r\nextravagance?\r\n\r\nI had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there\r\ncame to the university a young _parvenu_ nobleman, Glendinning--rich,\r\nsaid report, as Herodes Atticus--his riches, too, as easily\r\nacquired. I soon found him of weak intellect, and of course marked him\r\nas a fitting subject for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play,\r\nand contrived, with the gambler's usual art, to let him win\r\nconsiderable sums, the more effectually to entangle him in my\r\nsnares. At length, my schemes being ripe, I met him (with the full\r\nintention that this meeting should be final and decisive) at the\r\nchambers of a fellow-commoner (Mr. Preston) equally intimate with\r\nboth, but who, to do him justice, entertained not even a remote\r\nsuspicion of my design. To give to this a better coloring, I had\r\ncontrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten, and was\r\nsolicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear\r\naccidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe\r\nhimself. To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was\r\nomitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter\r\nfor wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.\r\n\r\nWe had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length\r\neffected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole\r\nantagonist. The game, too, was my favorite _écarté_. The rest of the\r\ncompany, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned their own\r\ncards, and were standing around us as spectators. The _parvenu_, who\r\nhad been induced, by my artifices in the early part of the evening, to\r\ndrink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness\r\nof manner for which his intoxication, I thought, might partially but\r\ncould not altogether account. In a very short period he had become my\r\ndebtor to a large amount, when, having taken a long draught of port,\r\nhe did precisely what I had been coolly anticipating--he proposed to\r\ndouble our already extravagant stakes.  With a well-feigned show of\r\nreluctance, and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him\r\ninto some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance,\r\ndid I finally comply.  The result, of course, did but prove how\r\nentirely the prey was in my toils; in less than an hour he had\r\nquadrupled his debt.  For some time his countenance had been losing\r\nthe florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I\r\nperceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful. I say, to my\r\nastonishment. Glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries\r\nas immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as yet lost,\r\nalthough in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very seriously\r\nannoy, much less so violently affect him. That he was overcome by the\r\nwine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented itself;\r\nand, rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the\r\neyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, I was\r\nabout to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when\r\nsome expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an\r\nejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave me\r\nto understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances\r\nwhich, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have\r\nprotected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.\r\n\r\nWhat now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say.  The\r\npitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom\r\nover all; and for some moments a profound silence was maintained,\r\nduring which I could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many\r\nburning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less\r\nabandoned of the party. I will even own that an intolerable weight of\r\nanxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and\r\nextraordinary interruption which ensued. The wide, heavy folding-doors\r\nof the apartment were all at once thrown open, to their full extent,\r\nwith a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by\r\nmagic, every candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us\r\njust to perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and\r\nclosely muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now total; and\r\nwe could only _feel_ that he was standing in our midst. Before any one\r\nof us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this\r\nrudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten\r\n_whisper_ which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, \"gentlmen, I\r\nmake no apology for this behavior, because, in thus behaving, I am but\r\nfulfilling a duty. You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true\r\ncharacter of the person who has to-night won at _écarté_ a large sum\r\nof money from Lord Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an\r\nexpeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary\r\ninformation. Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of\r\nthe cuff of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may\r\nbe found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning\r\nwrapper.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have\r\nheard a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once, and\r\nas abruptly as he had entered. Can I--shall I describe my sensations?\r\nMust I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned? Most assuredly I\r\nhad little time for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the\r\nspot, and lights were immediately re-procured. A search ensued. In the\r\nlining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in\r\n_écarté_, and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs,\r\nfacsimiles of those used at our sittings, with the single exception\r\nthat mine were of the species called, technically, _arrondis_; the\r\nhonors being slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly\r\nconvex at the sides. In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as\r\ncustomary, at the length of the pack, will invariably find that he\r\ncuts his antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the\r\nbreadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may\r\ncount in the records of the game.\r\n\r\nAny burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me\r\nless than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which\r\nit was received.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wilson,\" said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet\r\nan exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, \"Mr. Wilson, this is your\r\nproperty.\"  (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I\r\nhad thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon\r\nreaching the scene of play.) \"I presume it is supererogatory to seek\r\nhere\" (eying the folds of the garment with a bitter smile) \"for any\r\nfarther evidence of your skill. Indeed, we have had enough. You will\r\nsee the necessity, I hope, of quitting Oxford--at all events, of\r\nquitting instantly my chambers.\"\r\n\r\nAbased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I\r\nshould have resented this galling language by immediate personal\r\nviolence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a\r\nfact of the most startling character. The cloak which I had worn was\r\nof a rare description of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I\r\nshall not venture to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic\r\ninvention; for I was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in\r\nmatters of this frivolous nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached\r\nme that which he had picked up upon the floor, and near the\r\nfolding-doors of the apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly\r\nbordering upon terror, that I perceived my own already hanging on my\r\narm, (where I had no doubt unwittingly placed it) and that the one\r\npresented me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even the\r\nminutest possible particular. The singular being who had so\r\ndisastrously exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak;\r\nand none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party, with\r\nthe exception of myself. Retaining some presence of mind, I took the\r\none offered me by Preston; placed it, unnoticed, over my own; left the\r\napartment with a resolute scowl of defiance; and, next morning ere\r\ndawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Oxford to the continent,\r\nin a perfect agony of horror and of shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I fled in vain._ My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and\r\nproved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as\r\nyet only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris, ere I had fresh\r\nevidence of the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my\r\nconcerns. Years flew, while I experienced no relief. Villain!--at\r\nRome, with how untimely, yet with how spectral an officiousness,\r\nstepped he in between me and my ambition! At Vienna, too--at\r\nBerlin--and at Moscow!  Where, in truth, had I _not_ bitter cause to\r\ncurse him within my heart? From his inscrutable tyranny did I at\r\nlength flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence; and to the very\r\nends of the earth _I fled in vain._\r\n\r\nAnd again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would I\r\ndemand the questions, \"Who is he?--whence came he?--and what are his\r\nobjects?\" But no answer was there found. And now I scrutinized, with a\r\nminute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of\r\nhis impertinent supervision. But even here there was very little upon\r\nwhich to base a conjecture. It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one\r\nof the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path,\r\nhad he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb\r\nthose actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in\r\nbitter mischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority\r\nso imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of\r\nself-agency so pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!\r\n\r\nI had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long\r\nperiod of time (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity\r\nmaintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself) had so\r\ncontrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my\r\nwill, that I saw not, at any moment, the features of his face. Be\r\nWilson what he might, _this_, at least, was but the veriest of\r\naffectation, or of folly. Could he, for an instant, have supposed\r\nthat, in my admonisher at Eton--in the destroyer of my honor at\r\nOxford,--in him who thwarted my ambition at Rome, my revenge at Paris,\r\nmy passionate love at Naples, or what he falsely termed my avarice in\r\nEgypt,--that in this, my arch-enemy and evil genius, I could fail to\r\nrecognize the William Wilson of my schoolboy days: the namesake, the\r\ncompanion, the rival, the hated and dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby's?\r\nImpossible!--but let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the\r\ndrama.\r\n\r\nThus far I had succumbed suginely to this imperious domination. The\r\nsentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated\r\ncharacter, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and\r\nomnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which\r\ncertain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had\r\noperated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter\r\nweakness and helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although\r\nbitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will.  But, of late\r\ndays, I had given myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening\r\ninfluence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more\r\nimpatient of control. I began to murmur, to hesitate, to resist.  And\r\nwas it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the increase\r\nof my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional\r\ndiminution? Be this as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of\r\na burning hope, and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern\r\nand desperate resolution that I would submit no longer to be enslaved.\r\n\r\nIt was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18--, that I attended a\r\nmasquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I had\r\nindulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and\r\nnow the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me\r\nbeyond endurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the\r\nmazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my\r\ntemper; for I was anxiously seeking (let me not say with what unworthy\r\nmotive) the young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting\r\nDi Broglio. With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously\r\ncommunicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be\r\nhabited, and now, having caught a glimpse of her person, I was\r\nhurrying to make my way into her presence. At this moment I felt a\r\nlight hand placed upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low,\r\ndamnable _whisper_ within my ear.\r\n\r\nIn an absolute frenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus\r\ninterrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar. He was\r\nattired, as I had expected, in a costume altogether similar to my own;\r\nwearing a Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a\r\ncrimson belt sustaining a rapier. A mask of black silk entirely\r\ncovered his face.\r\n\r\n\"Scoundrel!\" I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable\r\nI uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury; \"scoundrel! impostor!\r\naccursed villain! you shall not--you _shall not_ dog me unto death!\r\nFollow me, or I stab you where you stand!\"--and I broke my way from\r\nthe ball-room into a small ante-chamber adjoining, dragging him\r\nunresistingly with me as I went.\r\n\r\nUpon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against\r\nthe wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to\r\ndraw. He hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew\r\nin silence, and put himself upon his defence.\r\n\r\nThe contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wild\r\nexcitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a\r\nmultitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the\r\nwainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with\r\nbrute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.\r\n\r\nAt that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastened to\r\nprevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying\r\nantagonist. But what human language can adequately portray _that_\r\nastonishment, _that_ horror which possessed me at the spectacle then\r\npresented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had\r\nbeen sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the\r\narrangements at the upper or farther end of the room. A large\r\nmirror--so at first it seemed to me in my confusion--now stood where\r\nnone had been perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in\r\nextremity of terror, mine own image, but with features all pale and\r\ndabbled in blood, advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering\r\ngait.\r\n\r\nThus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist--it was\r\nWilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution.\r\nHis mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon the floor. Not\r\na thread in all his raiment--not a line in all the marked and singular\r\nlineaments of his face which was not, even in the most absolute\r\nidentity, _mine own_!\r\n\r\nIt was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could have\r\nfancied that I myself was speaking while he said:--\r\n\r\n_\"You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also\r\ndead--dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst thou\r\nexist--and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how\r\nutterly thou hast murdered thyself.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTRÖM\r\n\r\n  The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as _our_ ways;\r\n  nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the\r\n  vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, _which have\r\n  a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus_.\r\n                                          JOSEPH GLANVILLE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes\r\nthe old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Not long ago,\" said he at length, \"and I could have guided you on\r\nthis route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years\r\npast, there happened to me an event such as never happened before to\r\nmortal man--or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of--and\r\nthe six hours of deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up\r\nbody and soul. You suppose me a _very_ old man--but I am not. It took\r\nless than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to\r\nwhite, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I\r\ntremble at the least exertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you\r\nknow I can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting\r\ngiddy?\"\r\n\r\nThe \"little cliff,\" upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown\r\nhimself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over\r\nit, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on\r\nits extreme and slippery edge--this \"little cliff\" arose, a sheer\r\nunobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen\r\nhundred feet from the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would have\r\ntempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so\r\ndeeply was I excited by the perilous position of my companion, that I\r\nfell at full length upon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me,\r\nand dared not even glance upward at the sky--while I struggled in vain\r\nto divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain\r\nwere in danger from the fury of the winds. It was long before I could\r\nreason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\"You must get over these fancies,\" said the guide, \"for I have brought\r\nyou here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of\r\nthat event I mentioned--and to tell you the whole story with the spot\r\njust under your eye.\r\n\r\n\"We are now,\" he continued, in that particularizing manner which\r\ndistinguished him--\"we are now close upon the Norwegian coast--in the\r\nsixty-eighth degree of latitude--in the great province of\r\nNordland--and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon\r\nwhose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a\r\nlittle higher--hold on to the grass if you feel giddy--so--and look\r\nout, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea.\"\r\n\r\nI looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters\r\nwore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian\r\ngeographer's account of the _Mare Tenebrarum_. A panorama more\r\ndeplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive. To the right\r\nand left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay outstretched, like\r\nramparts of the world, lines of horridly black and beetling cliff,\r\nwhose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the\r\nsurf which reared high up against it its white and ghastly crest,\r\nhowling and shrieking forever. Just opposite the promontory upon whose\r\napex we were placed, and at a distance of some five or six miles out\r\nat sea, there was visible a small, bleak-looking island; or, more\r\nproperly, its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge\r\nin which it was enveloped. About two miles nearer the land arose\r\nanother of smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed\r\nat various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant\r\nisland and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although,\r\nat the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the\r\nremote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly\r\nplunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like\r\na regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water\r\nin every direction--as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of\r\nfoam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"The island in the distance,\" resumed the old man, \"is called by the\r\nNorwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe.  That a mile to the\r\nnorthward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Iflesen, Hoeyholm, Kieldholm,\r\nSuarven, and Buckholm.  Farther off--between Moskoe and Vurrgh--are\r\nOtterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Skarholm. These are the true names\r\nof the places--but why it has been thought necessary to name them at\r\nall is more than either you or I can understand. Do you hear anything?\r\nDo you see any change in the water?\"\r\n\r\nWe had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which\r\nwe had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no\r\nglimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit. As the\r\nold man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing\r\nsound, like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American\r\nprairie; and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the\r\n_chopping_ character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing\r\ninto a current which set to the eastward.  Even while I gazed, this\r\ncurrent acquired a monstrous velocity.  Each moment added to its\r\nspeed--to its headlong impetuosity.  In five minutes the whole sea, as\r\nfar as Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between\r\nMoskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway. Here the vast\r\nbed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting\r\nchannels, burst suddenly into frenzied convulsion--heaving, boiling,\r\nhissing--gyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices, and all\r\nwhirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water\r\nnever elsewhere assumes, except in precipitous descents.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical\r\nalteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the\r\nwhirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam\r\nbecame apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks, at\r\nlength, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into\r\ncombination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided\r\nvortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more\r\nvast. Suddenly--very suddenly--this assumed a distinct and definite\r\nexistence, in a circle of more than a mile in diameter. The edge of\r\nthe whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no\r\nparticle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose\r\ninterior, as far as the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining,\r\nand jet-black wall of water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of\r\nsome forty-five degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with a\r\nswaying and sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an\r\nappalling voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty\r\ncataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw\r\nmyself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of\r\nnervous agitation.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said I at length, to the old man--\"this _can_ be nothing else\r\nthan the great whirlpool of the Maelström.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is sometimes termed,\" said he. \"We Norwegians call it the\r\nMoskoe-ström, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.\"  The ordinary\r\naccounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what I\r\nsaw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most circumstantial of\r\nany, cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence\r\nor of the horror of the scene--or of the wild bewildering sense of\r\n_the novel_ which confounds the beholder. I am not sure from what\r\npoint of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at what time;\r\nbut it could neither have been from the summit of Helseggen, nor\r\nduring a storm. There are some passages of his description,\r\nnevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although their\r\neffect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\n\"Between Lofoden and Moskoe,\" he says, \"the depth of the water is\r\nbetween thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward\r\nVer (Vurrgh), this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient\r\npassage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks,\r\nwhich happens even in the calmest weather. When it is flood, the\r\nstream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a\r\nboisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is\r\nscarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts, the noise\r\nbeing heard several leagues Off; and the vortices or pits are of such\r\nan extent and depth, that if a ship comes within its attraction, it is\r\ninevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom, and there beat to\r\npieces against the rocks; and when the water relaxes, the fragments\r\nthereof are thrown up again. But these intervals of tranquillity are\r\nonly at the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last\r\nbut a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually returning. When the\r\nstream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is\r\ndangerous to come within a Norway mile of it. Boats, yachts, and ships\r\nhave been carried away by not guarding against it before they were\r\nwithin its reach.  It likewise happens frequently that whales come too\r\nnear the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; and then it is\r\nimpossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their\r\nfruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once, attempting\r\nto swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne\r\ndown, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large\r\nstocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the current,\r\nrise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon\r\nthem. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among\r\nwhich they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by the\r\nflux and reflux of the sea--it being constantly high and low water\r\nevery six hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima\r\nSunday, it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones\r\nof the houses on the coast fell to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could\r\nhave been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nvortex. The \"forty fathoms\" must have reference only to portions of\r\nthe channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden.  The\r\ndepth in the centre of the Moskoe-ström must be immeasurably greater;\r\nand no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained\r\nfrom even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be\r\nhad from the highest crag of Helseggen. Looking down from this\r\npinnacle upon the howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling\r\nat the simplicity with which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a\r\nmatter difficult of belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears;\r\nfor it appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing that the largest\r\nships of the line in existence, coming within the influence of that\r\ndeadly attraction, could resist it as little as a feather the\r\nhurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.\r\n\r\nThe attempts to account for the phenomenon--some of which, I remember,\r\nseemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal--now wore a very\r\ndifferent and unsatisfactory aspect.  The idea generally received is\r\nthat this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Feroe Islands,\r\n\"have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling,\r\nat flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which\r\nconfines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and\r\nthus the higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the\r\nnatural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction\r\nof which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.\"--These are the\r\nwords of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica.\" Kircher and others imagine\r\nthat in the centre of the channel of the Maelström is an abyss\r\npenetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote part--the Gulf\r\nof Bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance.  This\r\nopinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed, my\r\nimagination most readily assented; and, mentioning it to the guide, I\r\nwas rather surprised to hear him say that, although it was the view\r\nalmost universally entertained of the subject by the Norwegians, it\r\nnevertheless was not his own. As to the former notion he confessed his\r\ninability to comprehend it; and here I agreed with him--for, however\r\nconclusive on paper, it becomes altogether unintelligible, and even\r\nabsurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.\r\n\r\n\"You have had a good look at the whirl now,\" said the old man, \"and if\r\nyou will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden\r\nthe roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you\r\nI ought to know something of the Moskoe-ström.\"\r\n\r\nI placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of\r\nabout seventy tons burden, with which we were in the habit of fishing\r\namong the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent\r\neddies at sea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one\r\nhas only the courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden\r\ncoastmen we three were the only ones who made a regular business of\r\ngoing out to the islands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great\r\nway lower down to the southward. There fish can be got at all hours,\r\nwithout much risk, and therefore these places are preferred. The\r\nchoice spots over here among the rocks, however, not only yield the\r\nfinest variety, but in far greater abundance; so that we often got in\r\na single day what the more timid of the craft could not scrape\r\ntogether in a week.  In fact, we made it a matter of desperate\r\nspeculation--the risk of life standing instead of labor, and courage\r\nanswering for capital.\r\n\r\n\"We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than\r\nthis; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of\r\nthe fifteen minutes' slack to push across the main channel of the\r\nMoskoe-ström, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage\r\nsomewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so\r\nviolent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time for\r\nslack-water again, when we weighed and made for home. We never set out\r\nupon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and\r\ncoming--one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return--and\r\nwe seldom made a miscalculation upon this point. Twice, during six\r\nyears, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead\r\ncalm, which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to\r\nremain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a\r\ngale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too\r\nboisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should have been\r\ndriven out to sea in spite of everything (for the whirlpools threw us\r\nround and round so violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchor\r\nand dragged it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the\r\ninnumerable cross currents--here to-day and gone to-morrow--which\r\ndrove us under the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.\r\n\r\n\"I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we\r\nencountered 'on the ground'--it is a bad spot to be in, even in good\r\nweather--but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the\r\nMoskoe-ström itself without accident; although at times my heart has\r\nbeen in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or\r\nbefore the slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought\r\nit at starting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish,\r\nwhile the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother\r\nhad a son eighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my\r\nown. These would have been of great assistance at such times, in using\r\nthe sweeps, as well as afterward in fishing--but, somehow, although we\r\nran the risk ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young ones get\r\ninto the danger--for, after all said and done, it _was_ a horrible\r\ndanger, and that is the truth.\r\n\r\n\"It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to\r\ntell you occurred. It was on the tenth of July, 18--, a day which the\r\npeople of this part of the world will never forget--for it was one in\r\nwhich blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the\r\nheavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the\r\nafternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west,\r\nwhile the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seamen among us could\r\nnot have forseen what was to follow.\r\n\r\n\"The three of us--my two brothers and myself--had crossed over to the\r\nislands about two o'clock P.M., and soon nearly loaded the smack with\r\nfine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day than we\r\nhad ever known them. It was just seven, _by my watch,_ when we weighed\r\nand started for home, so as to make the worst of the Ström at slack\r\nwater, which we knew would be at eight.\r\n\r\n\"We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some\r\ntime spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for\r\nindeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once we\r\nwere taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was most\r\nunusual--something that had never happened to us before--and I began\r\nto feel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat\r\non the wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I\r\nwas upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when,\r\nlooking astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular\r\ncopper-colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we\r\nwere dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state of\r\nthings, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think\r\nabout it. In less than a minute the storm was upon us--in less than\r\ntwo the sky was entirely overcast--and what with this and the driving\r\nspray, it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in\r\nthe smack.\r\n\r\n\"Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. The\r\noldest seaman in Norway never experienced anything like it. We had let\r\nour sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the first\r\npuff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed\r\noff--the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed\r\nhimself to it for safety.\r\n\r\n\"Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon\r\nwater. It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the\r\nbow, and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when\r\nabout to cross the Ström, by way of precaution against the chopping\r\nseas. But for this circumstance we should have foundered at once--for\r\nwe lay entirely buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped\r\ndestruction I cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of\r\nascertaining. For my part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I\r\nthrew myself flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of\r\nthe bow, and with my hands grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the\r\nforemast. It was mere instinct that prompted me to do this--which was\r\nundoubtedly the very best thing I could have done--for I was too much\r\nflurried to think.\r\n\r\n\"For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this\r\ntime I held my breath, and clung to the bolt.  When I could stand it\r\nno longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my\r\nhands, and thus got my head clear. Presently our little boat gave\r\nherself a shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and\r\nthus rid herself, in some measure, of the seas. I was now trying to\r\nget the better of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my\r\nsenses so as to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my\r\narm. It was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had\r\nmade sure that he was overboard--but the next moment all this joy was\r\nturned into horror--for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed\r\nout the word '_Moskoe-ström_!'\r\n\r\n\"No one-will ever know what my feelings were at that moment. I shook\r\nfrom head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. I\r\nknew what he meant by that one word well enough--I knew what he wished\r\nto make me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were\r\nbound for the whirl of the Ström, and nothing could save us!\r\n\r\n\"You perceive that in crossing the Ström _channel_, we always went a\r\nlong way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had\r\nto wait and watch carefully for the slack--but now we were driving\r\nright upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this! 'To be\r\nsure,' I thought, 'we shall get there just about the slack--there is\r\nsome little hope in that--but in the next moment I cursed myself for\r\nbeing so great a fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well\r\nthat we were doomed, had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.\r\n\r\n\"By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or\r\nperhaps we did not feel it so much as we scudded before it; but at all\r\nevents the seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and\r\nlay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular\r\nchange, too, had come over the heavens. Around in every direction it\r\nwas still as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all\r\nat once, a circular rift of clear sky--as clear as I ever saw--and of\r\na deep bright blue--and through it there blazed forth the full moon\r\nwith a lustre that I never before knew her to wear. She lit up\r\neverything about us with the greatest distinctness--but, oh God, what\r\na scene it was to light up!\r\n\r\n\"I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother--but, in some\r\nmanner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I\r\ncould not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top\r\nof my voice in his ear.  Presently he shook his head, looking as pale\r\nas death, and held up one of his fingers, as if to say _listen_!\r\n\r\n\"At first I could not make out what he meant--but soon a hideous\r\nthought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not\r\ngoing. I glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into\r\ntears as I flung it far away into the ocean. _It had run down at seven\r\no'clock! We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the\r\nStröm was in full fury!_\r\n\r\n\"When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the\r\nwaves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip\r\nfrom beneath her--which appears very strange to a landsman--and this\r\nis what is called _riding_ in sea phrase.\r\n\r\n\"Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but presently a\r\ngigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter, and bore us\r\nwith it as it rose--up--up--as if into the sky. I would not have\r\nbelieved that any wave could rise so high. And then down we came with\r\na sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as\r\nif I was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream. But while we\r\nwere up I had thrown a quick glance around--and that one glance was\r\nall sufficient. I saw our exact position in an instant. The\r\nMoskoe-ström whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead--but\r\nno more like the every-day Moskoe-ström, than the whirl as you now see\r\nit is like a mill-race. If I had not known where we were, and what we\r\nhad to expect, I should not have recognized the place at all. As it\r\nwas, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror. The lids clenched\r\nthemselves together as if in a spasm.\r\n\r\n\"It could not have been more than two minutes afterwards until we\r\nsuddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The boat\r\nmade a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new\r\ndirection like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring noise of\r\nthe water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek--such a\r\nsound as you might imagine given out by the water-pipes of many\r\nthousand steam-vessels, letting off their steam all together. We were\r\nnow in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I\r\nthought, of course, that another moment would plunge us into the\r\nabyss--down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the\r\namazing velocity with which we were borne along. The boat did not seem\r\nto sink into the water at all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the\r\nsurface of the surge. Her starboard side was next the whirl, and on\r\nthe larboard arose the world of ocean we had left. It stood like a\r\nhuge writhing wall between us and the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the\r\ngulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching\r\nit. Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal\r\nof that terror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was despair\r\nthat strung my nerves.\r\n\r\n\"It may look like boasting--but what I tell you is truth--I began to\r\nreflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and\r\nhow foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my\r\nown individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God's\r\npower. I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed\r\nmy mind. After a little while I became possessed with the keenest\r\ncuriosity about the whirl itself. I positively felt a _wish_ to\r\nexplore its depths, even at the sacrifice I was going to make; and my\r\nprincipal grief was that I should never be able to tell my old\r\ncompanions on shore about the mysteries I should see. These, no doubt,\r\nwere singular fancies to occupy a man's mind in such extremity--and I\r\nhave often thought, since, that the revolutions of the boat around the\r\npool might have rendered me a little light-headed.\r\n\r\n\"There was another circumstance which tended to restore my\r\nself-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could\r\nnot reach us in our present situation--for, as you saw yourself, the\r\nbelt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean,\r\nand this latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous\r\nridge. If you have never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no\r\nidea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray\r\ntogether. They blind, deafen, and strangle you, and take away all\r\npower of action or reflection.  But we were now, in a great measure,\r\nrid of these annoyances--just as death-condemned felons in prison are\r\nallowed petty indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\n\"How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say. We\r\ncareered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than\r\nfloating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the\r\nsurge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this\r\ntime I had never let go of the ring-bolt. My brother was at stern,\r\nholding on to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed\r\nunder the coop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had\r\nnot been swept overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached\r\nthe brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the\r\nring, from which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force\r\nmy hands, as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure\r\ngrasp. I never felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this\r\nact--although I new he was a madman when he did it--a raving maniac\r\nthrough sheer fright. I did not care, however, to contest the point\r\nwith him. I knew it could make no diference whether either of us held\r\non at all; so I let him have the bolt, and went astern to the\r\ncask. This there was no great difficulty in doing; for the smack flew\r\nround steadily enough, and upon an even keel--only swaying to and fro,\r\nwith the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl.  Scarcely had I\r\nsecured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to\r\nstarboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I muttered a hurried\r\nprayer to God, and thought all was over.\r\n\r\n\"As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively\r\ntightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. For some\r\nseconds I dared not open them--while I expected instant destruction,\r\nand wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the\r\nwater. But moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of\r\nfalling had ceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had\r\nbeen before, while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she\r\nnow lay more along. I took courage and looked once again upon the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n\"Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration\r\nwith which I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by\r\nmagic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in\r\ncircumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides\r\nmight have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity\r\nwith which they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance\r\nthey shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift\r\namid the clouds, which I have already described, streamed in a flood\r\nof golden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the\r\ninmost recesses of the abyss.\r\n\r\n\"At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately. The\r\ngeneral burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld. When I\r\nrecovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively\r\ndownward. In this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view,\r\nfrom the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the\r\npool. She was quite upon an even keel--that is to say, her deck lay in\r\na plane parallel with that of the water--but this latter sloped at an\r\nangle of more than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying\r\nupon our beam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I\r\nhad scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in\r\nthis situation, than if we had been upon a dead level; and this, I\r\nsuppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved.\r\n\r\n\"The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound\r\ngulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a\r\nthick mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which\r\nthere hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering\r\nbridge which Mussulmans say is the only pathway between Time and\r\nEternity. This mist, or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing\r\nof the great walls of the funnel, as they all met together at the\r\nbottom--but the yell that went up to the heavens from out of that\r\nmist, I dare not attempt to describe.\r\n\r\n\"Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above,\r\nhad carried us to a great distance down the slope; but our farther\r\ndescent was by no means proportionate. Round and round we swept--not\r\nwith any uniform movement but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent\r\nus sometimes only a few hundred yards--sometimes nearly the complete\r\ncircuit of the whirl. Our progress downward, at each revolution, was\r\nslow, but very perceptible.\r\n\r\n\"Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were\r\nthus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the\r\nembrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were visible fragments\r\nof vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with\r\nmany smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken\r\nboxes, barrels, and staves. I have already described the unnatural\r\ncuriosity which had taken the place of my original terrors. It\r\nappeared to grow upon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful\r\ndoom. I now began to watch, with a strange interest, the numerous\r\nthings that floated in our company. I _must_ have been delirious--for\r\nI even sought _amusement_ in speculating upon the relative velocities\r\nof their several descents toward the foam below. 'This fir tree,' I\r\nfound myself at one time saying, 'will certainly be the next thing\r\nthat takes the awful plunge and disappears,'--and then I was\r\ndisappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship overtook\r\nit and went down before. At length, after making several guesses of\r\nthis nature, and being deceived in all--this fact--the fact of my\r\ninvariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of reflection that made\r\nmy limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily once more.\r\n\r\n\"It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a more\r\nexciting _hope_. This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from\r\npresent observation. I called to mind the great variety of buoyant\r\nmatter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and\r\nthen thrown forth by the Moskoe-ström. By far the greater number of\r\nthe articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way--so chafed\r\nand roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of\r\nsplinters--but then I distinctly recollected that there were _some_ of\r\nthem which were not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for\r\nthis difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were\r\nthe only ones which had been _completely absorbed_--that the others\r\nhad entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, from some\r\nreason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not\r\nreach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as\r\nthe case might be. I conceived it possible, in either instance, that\r\nthey might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without\r\nundergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early or\r\nabsorbed more rapidly. I made, also, three important observations. The\r\nfirst was, that as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the\r\nmore rapid their descent; the second, that, between two masses of\r\nequal extent, the one spherical, and the other _of any other shape,_\r\nthe superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere; the third,\r\nthat, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the\r\nother of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly.\r\nSince my escape, I have had several conversations on this subject with\r\nan old schoolmaster of the district; and it was from him that I\r\nlearned the use of the words 'cylinder' and 'sphere.' He explained to\r\nme--although I have forgotten the explanation--how what I observed\r\nwas, in fact, the natural consequence of the forms of the floating\r\nfragments, and showed me how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in\r\na vortex, offered more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in\r\nwith greater difficulty, than an equally bulky body, of any form\r\nwhatever.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Archimedes, _De iis Ques in Humido Vehuntur_, lib\r\nii.]\r\n\r\n\"There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in\r\nenforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to\r\naccount, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed something\r\nlike a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of\r\nthese things, which had been on our level when I first opened my eyes\r\nupon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up above us, and\r\nseemed to have moved but little from their original station.\r\n\r\n\"I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself securely\r\nto the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the\r\ncounter, and to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my\r\nbrother's attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that\r\ncame near us, and did everything in my power to make him understand\r\nwhat I was about to do. I thought at length that he comprehended my\r\ndesign--but, whether this was the case or not, he shook his head\r\ndespairingly, and refused to move from his station by the ring-bolt.\r\nIt was impossible to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay;\r\nand so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened\r\nmyself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the\r\ncounter, and precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another\r\nmoment's hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be.  As it is\r\nmyself who now tell you this tale--as you see that I _did_ escape--and\r\nas you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was\r\neffected, and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to\r\nsay--I will bring my story quickly to conclusion. It might have been\r\nan hour, or thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having\r\ndescended to a vast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild\r\ngyrations in rapid succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it,\r\nplunged headlong, at once and forever, into the chaos of foam\r\nbelow. The barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther\r\nthan half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at\r\nwhich I leaped overboard, before a great change took place in the\r\ncharacter of the whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the vast funnel\r\nbecame momently less and less steep.  The gyrations of the whirl grew,\r\ngradually, less and less violent.  By degrees, the froth and the\r\nrainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to\r\nuprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone down, and the full moon\r\nwas setting radiantly in the west, when I found myself on the surface\r\nof the ocean, in full view of the shores of Lofoden, and above the\r\nspot where the pool of the Moskoe-ström _had been._ It was the 20 hour\r\nof the slack, but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the\r\neffects of the hurricane. I was borne violently into the channel of\r\nthe Ström, and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the\r\n'grounds' of the fishermen. A boat picked me up--exhausted from\r\nfatigue--and (now that the danger was removed) speechless from the\r\nmemory of its horror.  Those who drew me on board were my old mates\r\nand daily companions, but they knew me no more than they would have\r\nknown a traveller from the spirit-land. My hair, which had been\r\nraven-black the day before, was as white as you see it now.  They say\r\ntoo that the whole expression of my countenance had changed. I told\r\nthem my story--they did not believe it. I now tell it to you--and I\r\ncan scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry\r\nfishermen of Lofoden.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\n(NORTHERN ITALY)\r\n\r\nThe \"Red Death\" had long devastated the country. No pestilence had\r\never been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its avatar and its\r\nseal--the redness and the horror of blood.  There were sharp pains,\r\nand sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with\r\ndissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body, and especially upon the\r\nface, of the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid\r\nand from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure,\r\nprogress, and termination of the disease were the incidents of half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nBut the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When\r\nhis dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a\r\nthousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and\r\ndames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of\r\none of his castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent\r\nstructure, the creation of the Prince's own eccentric yet august\r\ntaste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of\r\niron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy\r\nhammers, and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of\r\ningress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from\r\nwithin. The abbey was amply provisioned.  With such precautions the\r\ncourtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could\r\ntake care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to\r\nthink. The Prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There\r\nwere buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers,\r\nthere were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and\r\nsecurity were within. Without was the \"Red Death.\"\r\n\r\nIt was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion,\r\nand while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince\r\nProspero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most\r\nunusual magnificence.\r\n\r\nIt was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of\r\nthe rooms in which it was held. There were seven--an imperial\r\nsuite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight\r\nvista, while the folding-doors slide back nearly to the walls on\r\neither hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely\r\nimpeded. Here the case was very different, as might have been expected\r\nfrom the Prince's love of the bizarre. The apartments were so\r\nirregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one\r\nat a time.  There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards,\r\nand at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle\r\nof each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed\r\ncorridor which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were\r\nof stained glass, whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing\r\nhue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at\r\nthe eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue--and vividly blue\r\nwere its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and\r\ntapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was green\r\nthroughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and\r\nlighted with orange, the fifth with white, the sixth with violet. The\r\nseventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that\r\nhung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds\r\nupon a carpet of the same material and hue. But, in this chamber only,\r\nthe color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations.\r\nThe panes here were scarlet--a deep blood-color. Now in no one of the\r\nseven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion\r\nof golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the\r\nroof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle\r\nwithin the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the\r\nsuite there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a\r\nbrazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and\r\nso glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of\r\ngaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber\r\nthe effect of the firelight that streamed upon the dark hangings\r\nthrough the blood-tinted panes was ghastly in the extreme, and\r\nproduced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered\r\nthat there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its\r\nprecincts at all.\r\n\r\nIt was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western\r\nwall a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a\r\ndull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the\r\ncircuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from\r\nthe brazen lungs of the clock a sounct which was clear and loud and\r\ndeep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiars note and emphasis\r\nthat, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were\r\nconstrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to\r\nthe sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and\r\nthere was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the\r\nchimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew\r\npale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows\r\nas if in confused revery or meditation. But when the echoes had fully\r\nceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians\r\nlooked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and\r\nfolly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next\r\nchiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and\r\nthen, after the lapse of sixty minutes (which embrace three thousand\r\nand six hundred seconds of the Time that flies) there came yet another\r\nchiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and\r\ntremulousness and meditation as before.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The\r\ntastes of the Prince were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors and\r\neffects. He disregarded the _decora_ of mere fashion. His plans were\r\nbold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There\r\nare some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he\r\nwas not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be _sure_\r\nthat he was not.\r\n\r\nHe had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the\r\nseven chambers, upon occasion of this great _fête_; and it was his own\r\nguiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure\r\nthey were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy\r\nand phantasm--much of what has been since seen in _Hernani_. There\r\nwere arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There\r\nwere delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There was much of\r\nthe beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of\r\nthe terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited\r\ndisgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a\r\nmultitude of dreams. And these--the dreams--writhed in and about,\r\ntaking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra\r\nto seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony\r\nclock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment,\r\nall is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The\r\ndreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die\r\naway--they have endured but an instant--and a light, half-subdued\r\nlaughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music\r\nswells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than\r\never, taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the\r\nrays from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly\r\nof the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the\r\nnight is waning away, and there flows a ruddier light through the\r\nblood-colored panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appalls;\r\nand to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from\r\nthe near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any\r\nwhich reaches _their_ ears who indulge in the more remote gayeties of\r\nthe other apartments.\r\n\r\nBut these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat\r\nfeverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until\r\nat length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And\r\nthen the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the\r\nwaltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things\r\nas before. But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell\r\nof the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought\r\ncrept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among\r\nthose who revelled. And thus too it happened, perhaps, that before the\r\nlast echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there\r\nwere many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become\r\naware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the\r\nattention of no single individual before. And the rumor of this new\r\npresence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at\r\nlength from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of\r\ndisapprobation and surprise--then, finally, of terror, of horror, and\r\nof disgust.\r\n\r\nIn an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be\r\nsupposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such\r\nsensation. In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly\r\nunlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone\r\nbeyond the bounds of even the Prince's indefinite decorum. There are\r\nchords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched\r\nwithout emotion.  Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death\r\nare equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made. The\r\nwhole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume\r\nand bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The\r\nfigure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the\r\nhabiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made\r\nso nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the\r\nclosest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And\r\nyet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad\r\nrevellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type\r\nof the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in _blood_--and his broad\r\nbrow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the\r\nscarlet horror.\r\n\r\nWhen the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which\r\nwith a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its\r\n_role_, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be\r\nconvulsed, in the first moment, with a strong shudder either of terror\r\nor distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.\r\n\r\n\"Who dares?\" he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near\r\nhim--\"who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and\r\nunmask him--that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the\r\nbattlements!\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince\r\nProspero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven\r\nrooms loudly and clearly--for the Prince was a bold and robust man,\r\nand the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.\r\n\r\nIt was in the blue room where stood the Prince, with a group of pale\r\ncourtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight\r\nrushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who\r\nat the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and\r\nstately step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain\r\nnameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired\r\nthe whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize\r\nhim; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the Prince's\r\nperson; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank\r\nfrom the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way\r\nuninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had\r\ndistinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the\r\npurple--through the purple to the green--through the green to the\r\norange--through this again to the white--and even thence to the\r\nviolet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was\r\nthen, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the\r\nshame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six\r\nchambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that\r\nhad seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached,\r\nin rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating\r\nfigure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet\r\napartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a\r\nsharp cry--and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet,\r\nupon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince\r\nProspero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the\r\nrevellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and,\r\nseizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless\r\nwithin the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at\r\nfinding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled\r\nwith so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.\r\n\r\nAnd now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death.  He had come\r\nlike a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the\r\nblood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing\r\nposture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with\r\nthat of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired.\r\nAnd Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion\r\nover all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOLD BUG\r\n\r\n  What ho! what ho! this fellow is dancing mad!\r\n  He hath been bitten by the Tarantula.\r\n                               _All in the Wrong_\r\n\r\n\r\nMany years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr.  William Legrand.\r\nHe was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a\r\nseries of misfortunes had reduced him to want.  To avoid the\r\nmortification consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the\r\ncity of his fore-fathers, and took up his residence at Sullivan's\r\nIsland, near Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThis island is a very singular one.  It consists of little else than\r\nthe sea sand, and is about three miles long.  Its breadth at no point\r\nexceeds a quarter of a mile. It is separated from the mainland by a\r\nscarcely perceptible creek, oozing its way through a wilderness of\r\nreeds and slime, a favorite resort of the marsh-hen. The vegetation,\r\nas might be supposed, is scant, or at least dwarfish. No trees of any\r\nmagnitude are to be seen. Near the western extremity, where Fort\r\nMoultrie stands, and where are some miserable frame buildings,\r\ntenanted during summer by the fugitives from Charleston dust and\r\nfever, may be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto; but the whole\r\nisland, with the exception of this western point, and a line of hard\r\nwhite beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense undergrowth of\r\nthe sweet myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists of England.\r\nThe shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and\r\nforms an almost impenetrable coppice, burdening the air with its\r\nfragrance.\r\n\r\nIn the utmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern or\r\nmore remote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a small hut,\r\nwhich he occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his\r\nacquaintance. This soon ripened into, friendship--for there was much\r\nin the recluse to excite interest and esteem. I found him well\r\neducated, with unusual powers of mind, but infected with misanthropy,\r\nand subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy.\r\nHe had with him many books, but rarely employed them.  His chief\r\namusements were gunning and fishing, or sauntering along the beach and\r\nthrough the myrtles in quest of shells or entomological\r\nspecimens;--his collection of the latter might have been envied by a\r\nSwammerdamm. In these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old\r\nnegro, called Jupiter, who had been manumitted before the reverses of\r\nthe family, but who could be induced, neither by threats nor by\r\npromises, to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon\r\nthe footsteps of his young \"Massa Will.\" It is not improbable that the\r\nrelatives of Legrand, conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in\r\nintellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a\r\nview to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.\r\n\r\nThe winters in the latitude of Sullivan's Island are seldom very\r\nsevere, and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a\r\nfire is considered necessary. About the middle of October, 18--, there\r\noccurred, however, a day of remarkable chilliness. Just before sunset\r\nI scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend,\r\nwhom I had not visited for several weeks--my residence being at that\r\ntime in Charleston, a distance of nine miles from the island, while\r\nthe facilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of\r\nthe present day. Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom,\r\nand, getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was\r\nsecreted, unlocked the door and went in. A fine fire was blazing upon\r\nthe hearth. It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one. I\r\nthrew off an overcoat, took an armchair by the crackling logs, and\r\nawaited patiently the arrival of my hosts.\r\n\r\nSoon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial\r\nwelcome. Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare\r\nsome marsh-hens for supper. Legrand was in one of his fits--how else\r\nshall I term them?--of enthusiasm. He had found an unknown bivalve,\r\nforming a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and\r\nsecured, with Jupiter's assistance, a _scarabæus_ which he believed to\r\nbe totally new, but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion\r\non the morrow.\r\n\r\n\"And why not to-night?\" I asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and\r\nwishing the whole tribe of _scarabæi_ at the devil.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, if I had only known you were here!\" said Legrand, \"but it's so\r\nlong since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would pay me a\r\nvisit this very night of all others?  As I was coming home I met\r\nLieutenant G----, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the\r\nbug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until the\r\nmorning. Stay here to-night, and I will send Jup down for it at\r\nsunrise. It is the loveliest thing in creation!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?--sunrise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! no!--the bug. It is of a brilliant gold color--about the\r\nsize of a large hickory-nut--with two jet black spots near one\r\nextremity of the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other. The\r\n_antennæ_ are--\"\r\n\r\n\"Dey aint _no_ tin in him, Massa Will, I keep a tellin on you,\" here\r\ninterrupted Jupiter; \"de bug is a goole-bug, solid, ebery bit of him,\r\ninside and all, sep him wing--neber-feel half so hebby a bug in my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose it is, Jup,\" replied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly,\r\nit seemed to me, than the case demanded, \"is that any reason for your\r\nletting the birds burn? The color\"--here he turned to me--\"is really\r\nalmost enough to warrant Jupiter's idea. You never saw a more\r\nbrilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit--but of this you cannot\r\njudge till to-morrow. In the meantime I can give you some idea of the\r\nshape.\" Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were\r\na pen and ink, but no paper. He looked for some in a drawer, but found\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said he at length, \"this will answer;\" and he drew from\r\nhis waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty foolscap,\r\nand made upon it a rough drawing with the pen.  While he did this, I\r\nretained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly.  When the design\r\nwas complete, he handed it to me without rising.  As I received it, a\r\nlow growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door. Jupiter\r\nopened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in,\r\nleaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown\r\nhim much attention during previous visits.  When his gambols were\r\nover, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not\r\na little puzzled at what my friend had depicted.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, \"this _is_ a\r\nstrange _scarabæus_, I must confess; new to me: never saw anything\r\nlike it before--unless it was a skull, or a death's-head, which it\r\nmore nearly resembles than anything else that has come under _my_\r\nobservation.\"\r\n\r\n\"A death's-head!\"  echoed Legrand--\"oh--yes--well, it has something of\r\nthat appearance upon paper, no doubt.  The two upper black spots look\r\nlike eyes, eh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth--and then\r\nthe shape of the whole is oval.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so,\" said I; \"but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. I must\r\nwait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its\r\npersonal appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll, I don't know,\" said he, a little nettled, \"I draw\r\ntolerably--_should_ do it at least--have had good masters, and flatter\r\nmyself that I am not quite a blockhead.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,\" said I; \"this is a very\r\npassable _skull_,--indeed, I may say that it is a very _excellent_\r\nskull, according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of\r\nphysiology--and your _scarabæus_ must be the queerest _scarabæus_\r\nin the world if it resembles it. Why, we may get up a very thrilling\r\nbit of superstition upon this hint.  I presume you will call the bug\r\n_scarabæus caput hominis_, or something of that kind--there are\r\nmany similar titles in the Natural Histories.  But where are the\r\n_antennae_ you spoke of?\"  \"The _antennae_!\" said Legrand, who seemed\r\nto be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject; \"I am sure you must\r\nsee the _antennae_. I made them as distinct as they are in the\r\noriginal insect, and I presume that is sufficient.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" I said, \"perhaps you have--still I don't see them;\" and\r\nI handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing to\r\nruffle his temper, but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had\r\ntaken; his ill humor puzzled me--and as for the drawing of the\r\nbeetle, there were positively _no antennae_ visible, and the whole\r\n_did_ bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a\r\ndeath's-head.\r\n\r\nHe received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it,\r\napparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design\r\nseemed suddenly to rivet his attention.  In an instant his face grew\r\nviolently red--in another as excessively pale.  For some minutes he\r\ncontinued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat.  At length\r\nhe arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself\r\nupon a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room. Here again he\r\nmade an anxious examination of the paper; turning it in all\r\ndirections. He said nothing, however, and his conduct greatly\r\nastonished me; yet I thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing\r\nmoodiness of his temper by any comment. Presently he took from his\r\ncoat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully in it, and deposited\r\nboth in a writing-desk, which he locked. He now grew more composed in\r\nhis demeanor; but his original air of enthusiasm had quite\r\ndisappeared. Yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted.  As the\r\nevening wore away he became more and more absorbed in revery, from\r\nwhich no sallies of mine could arouse him. It had been my intention to\r\npass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before, but,\r\nseeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave. He did\r\nnot press me to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with even\r\nmore than his usual cordiality.\r\n\r\nIt was about a month after this (and during the interval I had seen\r\nnothing of Legrand) when I received a visit, at Charleston, from his\r\nman, Jupiter. I had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited,\r\nand I feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jup,\" said I, \"what is the matter now?--how is your master?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, to speak de troof, massa, him not so berry well as mought be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not well! I am truly sorry to hear it. What does he complain of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dar! dat's it!--him neber plain of notin--but him berry sick for all\r\ndat.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Very_ sick, Jupiter!--why didn't you say so at once? Is he confined\r\nto bed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dat he aint!--he aint find nowhar--dat's just whar de shoe\r\npinch--my mind is got to be berry hebby bout poor Massa Will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jupiter, I should like to understand what it is you are talking\r\nabout.  You say your master is sick.  Hasn't he told you what ails\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, massa, taint worf while for to git mad bout de matter--Massa\r\nWill say noffin at all aint de matter wid him--but den what make him\r\ngo about looking dis here way, wid he head down and he soldiers up,\r\nand as white as a gose?  And den he keep a syphon all de time--\"\r\n\r\n\"Keeps a what, Jupiter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de slate--de queerest figgurs I\r\nebber did see. Ise gittin to be skeered, I tell you.  Hab for to keep\r\nmighty tight eye pon him noovers. Todder day he gib me slip fore de\r\nsun up and was gone de whole ob de blessed day. I had a big stick\r\nready cut for to gib him d------d good beating when he did come--but\r\nIse sich a fool dat I hadn't de heart arter all--he look so berry\r\npoorly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?--what?--ah yes!--upon the whole I think you had better not be too\r\nsevere with the poor fellow--don't flog him, Jupiter--he can't very\r\nwell stand it--but can you form no idea of what has occasioned this\r\nillness, or rather this change of conduct? Has anything unpleasant\r\nhappened since I saw you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, massa, dey aint bin noffin onpleasant _since_ den--it 'twas\r\n_fore_ den I'm feared--'twas de berry day you was dare.\"\r\n\r\n\"How? what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, massa, I mean de bug--dare now.\"\r\n\r\n\"The what?\"\r\n\r\n\"De bug--I'm berry sartin dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere bout de\r\nhead by dat goole-bug.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such a supposition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Claws enuff, massa, and mouff too.  I nebber did see sich a d------d\r\nbug--he kick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him.  Massa Will\r\ncotch him fuss, but had for to let him go gin mighty quick, I tell\r\nyou--den was de time he must ha got de bite. I didn't like de look ob\r\nde bug mouff, myself, no how, so I wouldn't take hold ob him wid my\r\nfinger, but I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found. I rap him up\r\nin de paper and stuff piece of it in he mouff--dat was de way.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think, then, that your master was really bitten by the\r\nbeetle, and that the bite made him sick?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't tink noffin about it--I nose it. What make him dream bout de\r\ngoole so much, if taint cause he bit by de goole-bug? Ise heerd bout\r\ndem goole-bugs fore dis.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how do you know he dreams about gold?\"\r\n\r\n\"How I know? why, cause he talk about it in he sleep--dat's how I\r\nnose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jup, perhaps you are right; but to what fortunate circumstance\r\nam I to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"What de matter, massa?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, massa, I bring dis here pissel;\" and here Jupiter handed me a\r\nnote which ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR ----, Why have I not seen you for so long a time?  I hope you\r\nhave not been so foolish as to take offence at any little _brusquerie_\r\nof mine; but no, that is improbable.\r\n\r\n\"Since I saw you I have had great cause for anxiety. I have something\r\nto tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell it, or whether I should\r\ntell it at all.\r\n\r\n\"I have not been quite well for some days past, and poor old Jup\r\nannoys me, almost beyond endurance, by his well-meant attentions.\r\nWould you believe it?--he had prepared a huge stick, the other day,\r\nwith which to chastise me for giving him the slip, and spending the\r\nday, _solus_, among the hills on the mainland. I verily believe that\r\nmy ill looks alone saved me a flogging.\r\n\r\n\"I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.\r\n\r\n\"If you can, in any way, make it convenient, come over with Jupiter.\r\n_Do_ come. I wish to see you _to-night_, upon business of importance.\r\nI assure you that it is of the _highest_ importance.\r\n\r\n\"Ever yours,\r\n\"WILLIAM LEGRAND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was something in the tone of this note which gave me great\r\nuneasiness. Its whole style differed materially from that of Legrand.\r\nWhat could he be dreaming of? What new crotchet possessed his\r\nexcitable brain? What \"business of the highest importance\" could _he_\r\npossibly have to transact?  Jupiter's account of him boded no good. I\r\ndreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had, at length,\r\nfairly unsettled the reason of my friend. Without a moment's\r\nhesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the negro.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all\r\napparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to\r\nembark.\r\n\r\n\"What is the meaning of all this, Jup?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Him syfe, massa, and spade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true; but what are they doing here?\r\n\r\n\"Him de syfe and de spade what Massa Will sis pon my buying for him in\r\nde town, and de debbil's own lot of money I had to gib for em.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what, in the name of all that is mysterious, is your 'Massa Will'\r\ngoing to do with scythes and spades?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat's more dan _I_ know, and debbil take me if I don't blieve 'tis\r\nmore dan he know, too. But it's all cum ob de bug.\"\r\n\r\nFinding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of Jupiter, whose\r\nwhole intellect seemed to be absorbed by \"de bug,\" I now stepped into\r\nthe boat and made sail. With a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into\r\nthe little cove to the northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some\r\ntwo miles brought us to the hut. It was about three in the afternoon\r\nwhen we arrived.  Legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation.\r\nHe grasped my hand with a nervous _empressement_, which alarmed me and\r\nstrengthened the suspicions already entertained. His countenance was\r\npale even to ghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural\r\nlustre. After some inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not\r\nknowing what better to say, if he had yet obtained the _scarabæus_\r\nfrom Lieutenant G----.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" he replied, coloring violently, \"I got it from him the next\r\nmorning.  Nothing should tempt me to part with that _scarabæus_. Do\r\nyou know that Jupiter is quite right about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\" I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart.\r\n\r\n\"In supposing it to be a bug of _real gold_.\" He said this with an air\r\nof profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked.\r\n\r\n\"This bug is to make my fortune,\" he continued, with a triumphant\r\nsmile, \"to reinstate me in my family possessions.  Is it any wonder,\r\nthen, that I prize it? Since Fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon\r\nme, I have only to use it properly and I shall arrive at the gold of\r\nwhich it is the index. Jupiter, bring me that _scarabæus_!\"\r\n\r\n\"What! de bug, massa? I'd rudder not go fer trubble dat bug--you mus\r\ngit him for your own self.\" Hereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and\r\nstately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it\r\nwas enclosed. It was a beautiful _scarabæus_, and, at that time,\r\nunknown to naturalists--of course a great prize in a scientific point\r\nof view. There were two round, black spots near one extremity of the\r\nback, and a long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard\r\nand glossy, with all the appearance of burnished gold. The weight of\r\nthe insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things into\r\nconsideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting\r\nit; but what to make of Legrand's agreement with that opinion, I could\r\nnot, for the life of me, tell.\r\n\r\n\"I sent for you,\" said he, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had\r\ncompleted my examination of the beetle, \"I sent for you that I might\r\nhave your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of Fate and\r\nof the bug--\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Legrand,\" I cried, interrupting him, \"you are certainly\r\nunwell, and had better use some little precautions.  You shall go to\r\nbed, and I will remain with you a few days, until you get over\r\nthis. You are feverish and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Feel my pulse,\" said he.\r\n\r\nI felt it, and, to say the truth, found not the slightest indication\r\nof fever.\r\n\r\n\"But you may be ill, and yet have no fever. Allow me this once to\r\nprescribe for you. In the first place, go to bed. In the next--\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken,\" he interposed, \"I am as well as I can expect to be\r\nunder the excitement which I suffer. If you really wish me well, you\r\nwill relieve this excitement.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how is this to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very easily. Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the\r\nhills, upon the mainland, and, in this expedition, we shall need the\r\naid of some person in whom we can confide. You are the only one we can\r\ntrust. Whether we succeed or fail, the excitement which you now\r\nperceive in me will be equally allayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am anxious to oblige you in any way,\" I replied; \"but do you mean\r\nto say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your\r\nexpedition into the hills?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such absurd proceeding.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry--very sorry--for we shall have to try it by ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try it by yourselves! The man is surely mad!--but stay--how long do\r\nyou propose to be absent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably all night. We shall start immediately, and be back, at all\r\nevents, by sunrise.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will you promise me, upon your honor, that when this freak of\r\nyours is over, and the bug business (good God!)  settled to your\r\nsatisfaction, you will then return home and follow my advice\r\nimplicitly, as that of your physician?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I promise; and now let us be off, for we have no time to lose.\"\r\n\r\nWith a heavy heart I accompanied my friend. We started about four\r\no'clock--Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, and myself.  Jupiter had with him\r\nthe scythe and spades--the whole of which he insisted upon carrying,\r\nmore through fear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the\r\nimplements within reach of his master, than from any excess of\r\nindustry or complaisance His demeanor was dogged in the extreme, and\r\n\"dat d----d bug\" were the sole words which escaped his lips during the\r\njourney. For my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns,\r\nwhile Legrand contented himself with the _scarabæus,_ which he\r\ncarried attached to the end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and\r\nfro, with the air of a conjurer, as he went. When I observed this\r\nlast, plain evidence of my friend's aberation of mind, I could\r\nscarcely refrain from tears. I thought it best, however, to humor his\r\nfancy, at least for the present, or until I could adopt some more\r\nenergetic measures with a chance of success. In the meantime I\r\nendeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in regard to the object of\r\nthe expedition.  Having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him, he\r\nseemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor\r\nimportance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than \"we\r\nshall see!\"\r\n\r\nWe crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff,\r\nand, ascending the high grounds on the shore of the mainland,\r\nproceeded in a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country\r\nexcessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a human footstep was\r\nto be seen. Legrand led the way with decision; pausing only for an\r\ninstant, here and there, to consult what appeared to be certain\r\nlandmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion.\r\n\r\nIn this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun was just\r\nsetting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet\r\nseen. It was a species of tableland, near the summit of an almost\r\ninaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, and\r\ninterspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the\r\nsoil, and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves\r\ninto the valleys below merely by the support of the trees against\r\nwhich they reclined.  Deep ravines, in various directions, gave an air\r\nof still sterner solemnity to the scene.\r\n\r\nThe natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown\r\nwith brambles, through which we soon discovered that it would have\r\nbeen impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by\r\ndirection of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot\r\nof an enormously tall tulip tree, which stood, with some eight or ten\r\noaks, upon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees\r\nwhich I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in\r\nthe wide spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its\r\nappearance. When we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and\r\nasked him if he thought he could climb it. The old man seemed a little\r\nstaggered by the question, and for some moments made no reply. At\r\nlength he approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and\r\nexamined it with minute attention. When he had completed his scrutiny,\r\nhe merely said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then up with you as soon as possible, for it will soon be too dark to\r\nsee what we are about.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far mus go up, massa?\" inquired Jupiter.\r\n\r\n\"Get up the main trunk first, and then I will tell you which way to\r\ngo--and here--stop! take this beetle with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"De bug, Massa Will!--de goole-bug!\" cried the negro, drawing back in\r\ndismay--\"what for mus tote de bug way up de tree?--d--n if I do!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are afraid, Jup, a great big negro like you, to take hold of a\r\nharmless little dead beetle, why, you can carry it up by this\r\nstring--but, if you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall be\r\nunder the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel.\"\r\n\r\n\"What de matter now, massa?\" said Jup, evidently shamed into\r\ncompliance; \"always want fur to raise fuss wid old nigger.  Was only\r\nfunnin anyhow. _Me_ feered de bug! what I keer for de bug?\" Here he\r\ntook cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string, and,\r\nmaintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would\r\npermit, prepared to ascend the tree.\r\n\r\nIn youth, the tulip tree, or _Liriodendron Tulipifera_, the most\r\nmagnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and\r\noften rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its\r\nriper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs\r\nmake their appearance on the stem. Thus the difficulty of ascension,\r\nin the present case, lay more in semblance than in reality. Embracing\r\nthe huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms and knees,\r\nseizing with his hands some projections, and resting his naked toes\r\nupon others, Jupiter, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at\r\nlength wriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to\r\nconsider the whole business as virtually accomplished. The _risk_ of\r\nthe achievement was, in fact, now over, although the climber was some\r\nsixty or seventy feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Which way mus go now, Massa Will?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Keep up the largest branch,--the one on this side,\" said Legrand. The\r\nnegro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little trouble,\r\nascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his squat figure\r\ncould be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it.\r\nPresently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo.\r\n\r\n\"How much fudder is got for go?\"\r\n\r\n\"How high up are you?\" asked Legrand.\r\n\r\n\"Ebber so fur,\" replied the negro; \"can see de sky fru de top ob de\r\ntree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say. Look down the trunk and\r\ncount the limbs below you on this side. How many limbs have you\r\npassed?\"\r\n\r\n\"One, two, tree, four, fibe--I done pass fibe big limb, massa, pon dis\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go one limb higher.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the\r\nseventh limb was attained.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jup,\" cried Legrand, evidently much excited, \"I want you to work\r\nyour way out upon that limb as far as you can. If you see anything\r\nstrange, let me know.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time what little doubt I might have entertained of my poor\r\nfriend's insanity was put finally at rest. I had no alternative but to\r\nconclude him stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious\r\nabout getting him home. While I was pondering upon what was best to be\r\ndone, Jupiter's voice was again heard.\r\n\r\n\"Mos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry far--'tis dead limb putty\r\nmuch all de way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you say it was a _dead_ limb, Jupiter?\" cried Legrand in a\r\nquavering voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, massa, him dead as de door-nail--done up for sartain--done\r\ndeparted dis here life.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in the name of heaven shall I do?\" asked Legrand, seemingly in\r\nthe greatest distress.\r\n\r\n\"Do!\" said I, glad of an opportunity to interpose a word, \"why come\r\nhome and go to bed. Come now!--that's a fine fellow. It's getting\r\nlate, and, besides, you remember your promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jupiter,\" cried he, without heeding me in the least, \"do you hear\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try the wood well, then, with your knife, and see if you think it\r\n_very_ rotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,\" replied the negro in a few moments,\r\n\"but not so berry rotten as mought be. Mought ventur out leetle way\r\npon de limb by myself, dat's true.\"\r\n\r\n\"By yourself?--what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I mean de bug. 'Tis _berry_ hebby bug. Spose I drop him down\r\nfuss, and den de limb won't break wid just de weight ob one nigger.\"\r\n\r\n\"You infernal scoundrel!\" cried Legrand, apparently much relieved,\r\n\"what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that? As sure as you\r\nlet that beetle fall, I'll break your neck.  Look here, Jupiter! do\r\nyou hear me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, massa, needn't hollo at poor nigger dat style.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! now listen!--if you will venture out on the limb as far as you\r\nthink safe, and not let go the beetle, I'll make you a present of a\r\nsilver dollar as soon as you get down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm gwine, Massa Will--deed I is,\" replied the negro very\r\npromptly--\"mos out to the eend now.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Out to the end!_\" here fairly screamed Legrand, \"do you say you are\r\nout to the end of that limb?\"\r\n\r\n\"Soon be to de eend, massa,--o-o-o-o-oh! Lor-gol-a-marcy!  what _is_\r\ndis here pon de tree?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" cried Legrand, highly delighted, \"what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why taint noffin but a skull--somebody bin lef him head up de tree,\r\nand de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off.\"\r\n\r\n\"A skull, you say!--very well!--how is it fastened to the limb?--what\r\nholds it on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure nuff, massa; mus look. Why, dis berry curous sarcumstance, pon\r\nmy word--dare's a great big nail in de skull, what fastens ob it on to\r\nde tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well now, Jupiter, do exactly as I tell you--do you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, massa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pay attention, then!--find the left eye of the skull.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum! hoo! dat 's good! why, dar ain't no eye lef at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Curse your stupidity! do you know your right hand from your left?\"\r\n\r\nYes, I nose dat--nose all bout dat--'tis my lef hand what I chops de\r\nwood wid.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure! you are left-handed; and your left eye is on the same\r\nside as your left hand. Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye of\r\nthe skull, or the place where the left eye has been. Have you found\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nHere was a long pause. At length the negro asked, \"Is de lef eye of de\r\nskull pon de same side as de lef hand of de skull, too?--cause de\r\nskull ain't got not a bit ob a hand at all--nebber mind! I got de lef\r\neye now--here de lef eye! what mus do wid it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let the beetle drop through it, as far as the string will reach--but\r\nbe careful and not let go your hold of the string.\"\r\n\r\n\"All dat done, Massa Will; mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de\r\nhole--look out for him dar below!\"\r\n\r\nDuring this colloquy no portion of Jupiter's person could be seen; but\r\nthe beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now visible at the\r\nend of the string, and glistened like a globe of burnished gold in the\r\nlast rays of the setting sun, some of which still faintly illumined\r\nthe eminence upon which we stood. The _scarabæus_ hung quite clear of\r\nany branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fallen at our\r\nfeet. Legrand immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a\r\ncircular space, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the\r\ninsect, and, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the\r\nstring and come down from the tree.\r\n\r\nDriving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground at the precise spot\r\nwhere the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his pocket a\r\ntape-measure. Fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk of\r\nthe tree which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it till it reached the\r\npeg, and thence farther unrolled it, in the direction already\r\nestablished by the two points of the tree and the peg, for the\r\ndistance of fifty feet--Jupiter clearing away the brambles with the\r\nscythe. At the spot thus attained a second peg was driven, and about\r\nthis, as a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter,\r\ndescribed. Taking now a spade himself, and giving one to Jupiter and\r\none to me, Legrand begged us to set about digging as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nTo speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement at any\r\ntime, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly have\r\ndeclined it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued\r\nwith the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of escape, and was\r\nfearful of disturbing my poor friend's equanimity by a refusal. Could\r\nI have depended, indeed, upon Jupiter's aid, I would have had no\r\nhesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force; but I was\r\ntoo well assured of the old negro's disposition to hope that he would\r\nassist me, under any circumstances, in a personal contest with his\r\nmaster. I made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of\r\nthe innumerable Southern superstitions about money buried, and that\r\nhis fantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the\r\n_scarabæus_, or, perhaps, by Jupiter's obstinacy in maintaining it to\r\nbe \"a bug of real gold.\"  A mind disposed to lunacy would readily be\r\nled away by such suggestions, especially if chiming in with favorite\r\npreconceived ideas; and then I called to mind the poor fellow's speech\r\nabout the beetle's being \"the index of his fortune.\" Upon the whole, I\r\nwas sadly vexed and puzzled, but at length I concluded to make a\r\nvirtue of necessity--to dig with a good will, and thus the sooner to\r\nconvince the visionary, by ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the\r\nopinions he entertained.\r\n\r\nThe lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a\r\nmore rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our persons and\r\nimplements, I could not help thinking how picturesque a group we\r\ncomposed, and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared\r\nto any interloper who, by chance, might have stumbled upon our\r\nwhereabouts.\r\n\r\nWe dug very steadily for two hours. Little was said; and our chief\r\nembarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding\r\ninterest in our proceedings. He, at length, became so obstreperous\r\nthat we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the\r\nvicinity; or, rather, this was the apprehension of Legrand; for\r\nmyself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have\r\nenabled me to get the wanderer home. The noise was, at length, very\r\neffectually silenced by Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a\r\ndogged air of deliberation, tied the brute's mouth up with one of his\r\nsuspenders, and then returned, with a grave chuckle, to his task.\r\n\r\nWhen the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of five\r\nfeet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest. A general\r\npause ensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an end.\r\nLegrand, however, although evidently much disconcerted, wiped his brow\r\nthoughtfully and recommenced. We had excavated the entire circle of\r\nfour feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went\r\nto the farther depth of two feet. Still nothing appeared. The\r\ngold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied, at length clambered from the\r\npit, with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature,\r\nand proceeded, slowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he\r\nhad thrown off at the beginning of his labor. In the meantime I made\r\nno remark. Jupiter, at a signal from his master, began to gather up\r\nhis tools. This done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned in\r\nprofound silence towards home.\r\n\r\nWe had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when, with a\r\nloud oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar.\r\nThe astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent,\r\nlet fall the spades, and fell upon his knees.\r\n\r\n\"You scoundrel,\" said Legrand, hissing out the syllables from between\r\nhis clenched teeth--\"you infernal black villain!--speak, I tell\r\nyou!--answer me this instant, without prevarication!--which--which is\r\nyour left eye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?\"\r\nroared the terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his _right_ organ\r\nof vision, and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in\r\nimmediate dread of his master's attempt at a gouge.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so! I knew it! Hurrah!\" vociferated Legrand, letting the\r\nnegro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracoles, much to the\r\nastonishment of his valet, who, arising from his knees, looked mutely\r\nfrom his master to myself, and then from myself to his master.\r\n\r\n\"Come! we must go back,\" said the latter, \"the game's not up yet;\" and\r\nhe again led the way to the tulip tree.\r\n\r\n\"Jupiter,\" said he, when we reached its foot, \"come here!  Was the\r\nskull nailed to the limb with the face outward, or with the face to\r\nthe limb?\"\r\n\r\n\"De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes good,\r\nwidout any trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the\r\nbeetle?\" here Legrand touched each of Jupiter's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'Twas dis eye, massa--de lef eye--jis as you tell me,\" and here it\r\nwas his right eye that the negro indicated.\r\n\r\n\"That will do--we must try it again.\"\r\n\r\nHere my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I saw,\r\ncertain indications of method, removed the peg which marked the spot\r\nwhere the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the westward of\r\nits former position. Taking, now, the tape-measure from the nearest\r\npoint of the trunk to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension\r\nin a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was\r\nindicated, removed, by several yards, from the point at which we had\r\nbeen digging.\r\n\r\nAround the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former\r\ninstance, was now described, and we again set to work with the spades.\r\nI was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what had\r\noccasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great\r\naversion from the labor imposed. I had become most unaccountably\r\ninterested--nay, even excited. Perhaps there was something, amid all\r\nthe extravagant demeanor of Legrand--some air of forethought, or of\r\ndeliberation--which impressed me. I dug eagerly, and now and then\r\ncaught myself actually looking, with something that very much\r\nresembled expectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision of which\r\nhad demented my unfortunate companion. At a period when such vagaries\r\nof thought most fully possessed me, and when we had been at work\r\nperhaps an hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the violent\r\nhowlings of the dog. His uneasiness, in the first instance, had been\r\nevidently but the result of playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed\r\na bitter and serious tone. Upon Jupiter's again attempting to muzzle\r\nhim, he made furious resistance, and, leaping into the hole, tore up\r\nthe mould frantically with his claws. In a few seconds he had\r\nuncovered a mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons,\r\nintermingled with several buttons of metal, and what appeared to be\r\nthe dust of decayed woollen. One or two strokes of a spade upturned\r\nthe blade of a large Spanish knife, and, as he dug farther, three or\r\nfour loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light.\r\n\r\nAt sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but\r\nthe countenance of his master wore an air of extreme\r\ndisappointment. He urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and\r\nthe words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and fell forward, having\r\ncaught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried\r\nin the loose earth.\r\n\r\nWe now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more\r\nintense excitement. During this interval we had fairly unearthed an\r\noblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation and\r\nwonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing\r\nprocess--perhaps that of the bichloride of mercury. This box was three\r\nfeet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet\r\ndeep. It was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and\r\nforming a kind of trellis-work over the whole. On each side of the\r\nchest, near the top, were three rings of iron--six in all--by means of\r\nwhich a firm hold could be obtained by six persons.  Our utmost united\r\nendeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its\r\nbed. We at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight.\r\nLuckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding\r\nbolts. These we drew back--trembling and panting with anxiety. In an\r\ninstant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us. As\r\nthe rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards,\r\nfrom a confused heap of gold and of jewels, a glow and a glare that\r\nabsolutely dazzled our eyes.\r\n\r\nI shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I\r\ngazed. Amazement was, of course, predominant. Legrand appeared\r\nexhausted with excitement, and spoke very few words. Jupiter's\r\ncountenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is\r\npossible, in the nature of things, for any negro's visage to assume.\r\nHe seemed stupified--thunder-stricken. Presently he fell upon his\r\nknees in the pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the elbows in\r\ngold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath. At\r\nlength, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy:\r\n\r\n\"And dis all cum ob de goole-bug! de putty goole-bug!  de poor little\r\ngoole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style! Aint you shamed\r\nob yourself, nigger?--answer me dat!\"\r\n\r\nIt became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and\r\nvalet to the expediency of removing the treasure. It was growing late,\r\nand it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get everything\r\nhoused before daylight. It was difficult to say what should be done,\r\nand much time was spent in deliberation--so confused were the ideas of\r\nall. We finally lightened the box by removing two-thirds of its\r\ncontents, when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from\r\nthe hole. The articles taken out were deposited among the brambles,\r\nand the dog left to guard them, with strict orders from Jupiter\r\nneither, upon any pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his\r\nmouth until our return. We then hurriedly made for home with the\r\nchest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive toil, at one\r\no'clock in the morning. Worn out as we were, it was not in human\r\nnature to do more just now. We rested until two, and had supper;\r\nstarting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed with three stout\r\nsacks, which by good luck were upon the premises. A little before four\r\nwe arrived at the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as equally\r\nas might be, among us, and, leaving the holes unfilled, again set out\r\nfor the hut, at which, for the second time, we deposited our golden\r\nburdens, just as the first streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the\r\ntree-tops in the East.\r\n\r\nWe were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the\r\ntime denied us repose. After an unquiet slumber of some three or four\r\nhours' duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of\r\nour treasure.\r\n\r\nThe chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and\r\nthe greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents.\r\nThere had been nothing like order or arrangement.  Everything had been\r\nheaped in promiscuously. Having assorted all with care, we found\r\nourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first\r\nsupposed. In coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty\r\nthousand dollars: estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as\r\nwe could, by the tables of the period. There was not a particle of\r\nsilver. All was gold of antique date and of great variety: French,\r\nSpanish, and German money, with a few English guineas, and some\r\ncounters, of which we had never seen specimens before. There were\r\nseveral very large and heavy coins, so worn that we could make nothing\r\nof their inscriptions. There was no American money.  The value of the\r\njewels we found more difficulty in estimating.  There were\r\ndiamonds--some of them exceedingly large and fine--a hundred and ten\r\nin all, and not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable\r\nbrilliancy; three hundred and ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and\r\ntwenty-one sapphires, with an opal. These stones had all been broken\r\nfrom their settings and thrown loose in the chest. The settings\r\nthemselves, which we picked out from among the other gold, appeared to\r\nhave been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent identification.\r\nBesides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments:\r\nnearly two hundred massive finger and ear-rings; rich chains--thirty\r\nof these, if I remember; eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes;\r\nfive gold censers of great value; a prodigious golden punch-bowl,\r\nornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures;\r\nwith two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other smaller\r\narticles which I cannot recollect. The weight of these valuables\r\nexceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and in this\r\nestimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold\r\nwatches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars, if\r\none. Many of them were very old, and as time-keepers valueless, the\r\nworks having suffered more or less from corrosion; but all were richly\r\njewelled and in cases of great worth. We estimated the entire contents\r\nof the chest, that night, at a million and a half of dollars; and,\r\nupon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being\r\nretained for our own use), it was found that we had greatly\r\nundervalued the treasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense\r\nexcitement of the time had in some measure subsided, Legrand, who saw\r\nthat I was dying with impatience for a solution of this most\r\nextraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the\r\ncircumstances connected with it.\r\n\r\n\"You remember,\" said he, \"the night when I handed you the rough sketch\r\nI had made of the _scarabæus_. You recollect, also, that I became\r\nquite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a\r\ndeath's-head. When you first made this assertion I thought you were\r\njesting; but afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots on the\r\nback of the insect, and admitted to myself that your remark had some\r\nlittle foundation in fact. Still, the sneer at my graphic powers\r\nirritated me--for I am considered a good artist--and, therefore, when\r\nyou handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about to crumple it up and\r\nthrow it angrily into the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"The scrap of paper, you mean,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"No: it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed\r\nit to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at\r\nonce, to be a piece of very thin parchment.  It was quite dirty, you\r\nremember. Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance\r\nfell upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may\r\nimagine my astonishment when I perceived, in, fact, the figure of a\r\ndeath's-head just where, it seemed to me, I had made the drawing of\r\nthe beetle. For a moment I was too much amazed to think with accuracy.\r\nI knew that my design was very different in detail from this--although\r\nthere was a certain similarity in general outline.  Presently I took a\r\ncandle and, seating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to\r\nscrutinize the parchment more closely. Upon turning it over, I saw my\r\nown sketch upon the reverse, just as I had made it. My first idea,\r\nnow, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of\r\noutline--at the singular coincidence involved in the fact that,\r\nunknown to me, there should have been a skull upon the other side of\r\nthe parchment, immediately beneath my figure of the _scarabæus_, and\r\nthat this skull, not only in outline, but in size, should so closely\r\nresemble my drawing. I say the singularity of this coincidence\r\nabsolutely stupified me for a time. This is the usual effect of such\r\ncoincidences. The mind struggles to establish a connection--a sequence\r\nof cause and effect--and, being unable to do so, suffers a species of\r\ntemporary paralysis. But, when I recovered from this stupor, there\r\ndawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more\r\nthan the coincidence.  I began distinctly, positively, to remember\r\nthat there had been _no_ drawing on the parchment when I made my\r\nsketch of the _scarabæus_. I became perfectly certain of this; for I\r\nrecollected turning up first one side and then the other, in search of\r\nthe cleanest spot. Had the skull been then there, of course I could\r\nnot have failed to notice it. Here was indeed a mystery which I felt\r\nit impossible to explain; but, even at that early moment, there seemed\r\nto glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and secret chambers of my\r\nintellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that truth which last\r\nnight's adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration. I arose\r\nat once, and, putting the parchment securely away, dismissed all\r\nfarther reflection until I should be alone.\r\n\r\n\"When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself\r\nto a more methodical investigation of the affair. In the first place I\r\nconsidered the manner in which the parchment had come into my\r\npossession. The spot where we discovered the _scarabæus_ was on the\r\ncoast of the mainland, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a\r\nshort distance above high-water mark. Upon my taking hold of it, it\r\ngave me a sharp bite, which caused me to let it drop. Jupiter, with\r\nhis accustomed caution, before seizing the insect, which had flown\r\ntowards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something of that nature,\r\nby which to take hold of it. It was at this moment that his eyes, and\r\nmine also, fell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed to\r\nbe paper. It was lying half-buried in the sand, a corner sticking\r\nup. Near the spot where we found it, I observed the remnants of the\r\nhull of what appeared to have been a ship's long boat. The wreck\r\nseemed to have been there for a very great while; for the resemblance\r\nto boat timbers could scarcely be traced.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and\r\ngave it to me. Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way\r\nmet Lieutenant G----.  I showed him the insect, and he begged me to\r\nlet him take it to the fort. On my consenting, he thrust it forthwith\r\ninto his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been\r\nwrapped, and which I had continued to hold in my hand during his\r\ninspection.  Perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it\r\nbest to make sure of the prize at once--you know how enthusiastic he\r\nis on all subjects connected with Natural History. At the same time,\r\nwithout being conscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment in\r\nmy own pocket.\r\n\r\n\"You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making\r\na sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept. I\r\nlooked in the drawer, and found none there. I searched my pockets,\r\nhoping to find an old letter, and then my hand fell upon the\r\nparchment. I thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my\r\npossession; for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you will think me fanciful--but I had already established a\r\nkind of _connection_. I had put together two links of a great chain.\r\nThere was a boat lying on a seacoast, and not far from the boat was a\r\nparchment--_not a paper_--with a skull depicted on it. You will, of\r\ncourse, ask 'where is the connection?' I reply that the skull, or\r\ndeath's-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate. The flag of the\r\ndeath's-head is hoisted in all engagements.\r\n\r\n\"I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper.  Parchment\r\nis durable--almost imperishable. Matters of little moment are rarely\r\nconsigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of\r\ndrawing or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper. This\r\nreflection suggested some meaning--some relevancy--in the deaths-head.\r\nI did not fail to observe, also, the _form_ of the parchment. Although\r\none of its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be\r\nseen that the original form was oblong. It was just such a slip,\r\nindeed, as might have been chosen for a memorandum--for a record of\r\nsomething to be long remembered and carefully preserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I interposed, \"you say that the skull, was _not_ upon the\r\nparchment when you made the drawing of the beetle.  How then do you\r\ntrace any connection between the boat and the skull--since this\r\nlatter, according to your own admission, must have been designed (God\r\nonly knows how or by whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching\r\nthe _scarabæus_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this\r\npoint, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving. My steps were\r\nsure, and could afford but a single result. I reasoned, for example,\r\nthus: When I drew the _scarabæus,_ there was no skull apparent on the\r\nparchment. When I had completed the drawing I gave it to you, and\r\nobserved you narrowly until you returned it. _You_, therefore, did not\r\ndesign the skull, and no one else was present to do it. Then it was\r\nnot done by human agency. And nevertheless it was done.\r\n\r\n\"At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and _did_\r\nremember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred\r\nabout the period in question. The weather was chilly (O rare and happy\r\naccident!), and a fire was blazing on the hearth. I was heated with\r\nexercise and sat near the table. You, however, had drawn a chair close\r\nto the chimney.  Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as\r\nyou were in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered,\r\nand leaped upon your shoulders. With your left hand you caressed him\r\nand kept him off, while your right, holding the parchment, was\r\npermitted, to fall listlessly between your knees, and in close\r\nproximity to the fire. At one moment I thought the blaze had caught\r\nit, and was about to caution you, but, before I could speak, you had\r\nwithdrawn it, and were engaged in its examination. When I considered\r\nall these particulars, I doubted not for a moment that _heat_ had been\r\nthe agent in bringing to light, on the parchment, the skull which I\r\nsaw designed on it. You are well aware that chemical preparations\r\nexist, and have existed time out of mind, by means of which it is\r\npossible to write on either paper or vellum, so that the characters\r\nshall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire.\r\nZaffre, digested in _aqua regia_, and diluted with four times its\r\nweight of water, is sometimes employed; a green tint results. The\r\nregulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red. These\r\ncolors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material\r\nwritten upon cools, but again become apparent upon the re-application\r\nof heat.\r\n\r\n\"I now scrutinized the death's-head with care. Its outer edges--the\r\nedges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum--were far more\r\n_distinct_ than the others. It was clear that the action of the\r\ncaloric had been imperfect or unequal.  I immediately kindled a fire,\r\nand subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat. At\r\nfirst, the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the\r\nskull; but, on persevering in the experiment, there became visible at\r\nthe corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the\r\ndeath's-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to\r\nbe a goat. A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was\r\nintended for a kid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha!\" said I, \"to be sure I have no right to laugh at you--a\r\nmillion and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth--but you\r\nare not about to establish a third link in your chain: you will not\r\nfind any especial connection between your pirates and a goat; pirates,\r\nyou know, have nothing to do with goats; they appertain to the farming\r\ninterest.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have just said that the figure was _not_ that of a goat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a kid, then--pretty much the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty much, but not altogether,\" said Legrand. \"You may have heard\r\nof one _Captain_ Kidd. I at once looked on the figure of the animal as\r\na kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature. I say signature,\r\nbecause its position on the vellum suggested this idea. The\r\ndeath's-head at the corner diagonally opposite had, in the same\r\nmanner, the air of a stamp, or seal.  But I was sorely put out by the\r\nabsence of all else--of the body to my imagined instrument--of the\r\ntext for my context.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the\r\nsignature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something of that kind. The fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed\r\nwith a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending. I can\r\nscarcely say why. Perhaps, after all, it was rather a desire than an\r\nactual belief;--but do you know that Jupiter's silly words, about the\r\nbug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect on my fancy? And then\r\nthe series of accidents and coincidences--these were so _very_\r\nextraordinary.  Do you observe how mere an accident it was that these\r\nevents should have occurred on the _sole_ day of all the year in which\r\nit has been, or may be, sufficiently cool for fire, and that without\r\nthe fire, or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment\r\nin which he appeared, I should never have become aware of the\r\ndeath's-head, and so never the possessor of the treasure?\"\r\n\r\n\"But proceed--I am all impatience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current--the\r\nthousand vague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere on the\r\nAtlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates.  These rumors must have\r\nhad some foundation in fact. And that the rumors have existed so long\r\nand so continuously, could have resulted, it appeared to me, only from\r\nthe circumstance of the buried treasure still _remaining_ entombed.\r\nHad Kidd concealed his plunder for a time, and afterwards reclaimed\r\nit, the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present\r\nunvarying form. You will observe that the stories told are all about\r\nmoney-seekers, not about money-finders.  Had the pirate recovered his\r\nmoney, there the affair would have dropped. It seemed to me that some\r\naccident--say the loss of a memorandum indicating its locality--had\r\ndeprived him of the means of recovering it, and that this accident had\r\nbecome known to his followers, who otherwise might never have heard\r\nthat treasure had been concealed at all, and who, busying themselves\r\nin vain, because unguided, attempts to regain it, had given first\r\nbirth, and then universal currency, to the reports which are now so\r\ncommon. Have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed\r\nalong the coast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that Kidd's accumulations were immense is well known. I took it\r\nfor granted, therefore, that the earth still held them; and you will\r\nscarcely be surprised when I tell you that I felt a hope, nearly\r\namounting to certainty, that the parchment so strangely found involved\r\na lost record of the place of deposit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you proceed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I held the vellum again to the fire, after increasing the heat, but\r\nnothing appeared. I now thought it possible that the coating of dirt\r\nmight have something to do with the failure; so I carefully rinsed the\r\nparchment by pouring warm water over it, and, having done this, I\r\nplaced it in a tin pan, with the skull downwards, and put the pan upon\r\na furnace of lighted charcoal. In a few minutes, the pan having become\r\nthoroughly heated, I removed the slip, and, to my inexpressible joy,\r\nfound it spotted, in several places, with what appeared to be figures\r\narranged in lines. Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered it to\r\nremain another minute. Upon taking it off, the whole was just as you\r\nsee it now.\"\r\n\r\nHere Legrand, having reheated the parchment, submitted it to my\r\ninspection. The following characters were rudely traced, in a red\r\ntint, between the death's-head and the goat:--\r\n\r\n53‡‡†305))6*;4826)4‡.)4‡);806*;48†8¶60))85;;]8*;:‡*8†83(8\r\n8)5*†;46(;88*96*?;8)*‡(;485);5*†2:*‡(;4956*2(5*--4)8¶8*;4069\r\n285);)6†8)4‡‡;1(‡9;48081;8:8‡1;48†85;4)485†528806*81(‡9;48;(8\r\n8;4(‡?34;48)4‡;161;:188;‡?;\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said I, returning him the slip, \"I am as much in the dark as\r\never. Were all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me on my solution of\r\nthis enigma, I am quite sure, that I should be unable to earn them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said Legrand, \"the solution is by no means so difficult as\r\nyou might be led to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the\r\ncharacters. These characters, as any one might readily guess, form a\r\ncipher--that is to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what is\r\nknown of Kidd, I could not suppose, him capable of constructing any of\r\nthe more abstruse cryptographs. I made up my mind, at once, that this\r\nwas of a simple species--such, however, as would appear, to the crude\r\nintellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble without the key.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you really solved it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Readily; I have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times\r\ngreater. Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led me to\r\ntake interest in such riddles, and it may well be doubted whether\r\nhuman ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human\r\ningenuity may not, by proper application, resolve. In fact, having\r\nonce established connected and legible characters, I scarcely gave a\r\nthought to the mere difficulty of developing their import.\r\n\r\n\"In the present case--indeed in all cases of secret writing--the first\r\nquestion regards the _language_ of the cipher; for the principles of\r\nsolution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers are\r\nconcerned, depend on, and are varied by, the genius of the particular\r\nidiom. In general, there is no alternative but experiment (directed by\r\nprobabilities) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution,\r\nuntil the true one be attained. But, with the cipher now before us,\r\nall difficulty is removed by the signature. The pun upon the word\r\n'Kidd' is appreciable in no other language than the English. But for\r\nthis consideration I should have begun my attempts with the Spanish\r\nand French, as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most\r\nnaturally have been written by a pirate of the Spanish main. As it\r\nwas, I assumed the cryptograph to be English.\r\n\r\n\"You observe there are no divisions between the words.  Had there been\r\ndivisions, the task would have been comparatively easy.  In such case\r\nI should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter\r\nwords, and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as is most likely\r\n(_a_ or _I_, for example), I should have considered the solution as\r\nassured.  But, there being no division, my first step was to ascertain\r\nthe predominant letters, as well as the least frequent.  Counting all,\r\nI constructed a table, thus:\r\n\r\nOf the character  8 there are 33\r\n                  ;    \"     26\r\n                  4    \"     19\r\n                  ‡)   \"     16\r\n                  *    \"     13\r\n                  5    \"     12\r\n                  6    \"     11\r\n                 †1    \"      8\r\n                  0    \"      6\r\n                 92    \"      5\r\n                 :3    \"      4\r\n                  ?    \"      3\r\n                  ¶    \"      2\r\n                  ]    \"      1\r\n\r\n\"Now, in English, the letter which most frequently occurs is _e_.\r\nAfterwards the succession runs thus: _a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m\r\nw b k p q x z. E_ predominates, however, so remarkably that an\r\nindividual sentence of any length is rarely seen, in which it is not\r\nthe prevailing character.\r\n\r\n\"Here, then, we have, in the very beginning, the groundwork for\r\nsomething more than a mere guess. The general use which may be made of\r\nthe table is obvious--but, in this particular cipher, we shall only\r\nvery partially require its aid. As our predominant character is 8, we\r\nwill commence by assuming it as the _e_ of the natural alphabet. To\r\nverify the supposition, let us observe if the 8 be seen often in\r\ncouples--for _e_ is doubled with great frequency in English--in such\r\nwords, for example, as 'meet,' 'fleet,' 'speed,' 'seen,' 'been,'\r\n'agree,' etc. In the present instance we see it doubled no less than\r\nfive times, although the cryptograph is brief.\r\n\r\n\"Let us assume 8, then, as _e_. Now, of all _words_ in the language,\r\n'the' is most usual; let us see, therefore, whether there are not\r\nrepetitions of any three characters, in the same order of collocation,\r\nthe last of them being 8. If we discover repetitions of such letters,\r\nso arranged, they will most probably represent the word 'the.' On\r\ninspection, we find no less than seven such arrangements, the\r\ncharacters being ;48. We may, therefore, assume that the semicolon\r\nrepresents _t_, that 4 represents _h_, and that 8 represents _e_--the\r\nlast being now well confirmed. Thus a great step has been taken.\r\n\r\n\"But, having established a single word, we are enabled to establish a\r\nvastly important point; that is to say, several commencements and\r\nterminations of other words. Let us refer, for example, to the last\r\ninstance but one, in which combination ;48 occurs--not far from the\r\nend of the cipher.  We know that the semicolon immediately ensuing is\r\nthe commencement of a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this\r\n'the,' we are cognizant of no less than five. Let us set these\r\ncharacters down, thus, by the letters we know them to represent,\r\nleaving a space for the unknown--\r\n\r\n  t eeth\r\n\r\n\"Here we are enabled, at once, to discard the '_th_,' as forming no\r\nportion of the word commencing with the first _t_; since, by\r\nexperiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy,\r\nwe perceive that no word can be formed of which this _th_ can be a\r\npart. We are thus narrowed into\r\n\r\n  t ee,\r\n\r\nand, going through the alphabet, if necessary, as before, we arrive at\r\nthe word 'tree' as the sole possible reading. We thus gain another\r\nletter _r_, represented by (, with the words 'the tree' in\r\njuxtaposition.\r\n\r\n\"Looking beyond these words, for a short distance, we again see the\r\ncombination ;48, and employ it by way of _termination_ to what\r\nimmediately precedes. We have thus this arrangement:\r\n\r\n  the tree ;4(‡?34 the,\r\n\r\nor, substituting the natural letters, where known, it reads thus:\r\n\r\n  the tree thr‡?3h the.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if, in place of the unknown characters, we leave blank spaces,\r\nor substitute dots, we read thus:\r\n\r\n  the tree thr . . . h the,\r\n\r\nwhen the word '_through_' makes itself evident at once. But this\r\ndiscovery gives us three new letters, _o, u_, and _g_, represented by\r\n‡ ? and 3.\r\n\r\n\"Looking now, narrowly, through the cipher for combinations of known\r\ncharacters, we find, not very far from the beginning, this\r\narrangement,\r\n\r\n  83(88, or egree,\r\n\r\nwhich, plainly, is the conclusion of the word 'degree,' and gives us\r\nanother letter, _d_, represented by †.\r\n\r\n\"Four letters beyond the word 'degree,' we perceive the combination\r\n\r\n  ;46(;88*\r\n\r\n\"Translating the known characters, and representing the unknown by\r\ndots, as before, we read thus:\r\n\r\n  th . rtee,\r\n\r\nan arrangement immediately suggestive of the word 'thirteen,' and\r\nagain furnishing us with two new characters, _i_ and _n_, represented\r\nby 6 and *.\r\n\r\n\"Referring, now, to the beginning of the cryptograph, we find the\r\ncombination,\r\n\r\n  53‡‡†,\r\n\r\n\"Translating as before, we obtain\r\n\r\n  good,\r\n\r\nwhich assures us that the first letter is _A_, and that the first two\r\nwords are 'A good.'\r\n\r\n\"To avoid confusion, it is now time that we arrange our key, as far as\r\ndiscovered, in a tabular form. It will stand thus:\r\n\r\n5  represents a\r\n†      \"      d\r\n8      \"      e\r\n3      \"      g\r\n4      \"      h\r\n6      \"      i\r\n*      \"      n\r\n‡      \"      o\r\n(      \"      r\r\n;      \"      t\r\n\r\n\"We have, therefore, no less than ten of the most important letters\r\nrepresented, and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details of\r\nthe solution. I have said enough to convince you that ciphers of this\r\nnature are readily soluble, and to give you some insight into the\r\nrationale of their development. But be assured that the specimen\r\nbefore us appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph. It\r\nnow only remains to give you the full translation of the characters\r\nupon the parchment, 5 as unriddled. Here it is:\r\n\r\n\"'_A good glass in the bishop's hostel in the devil's seat twenty-one\r\ndegrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch\r\nseventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the death's-head a\r\nbee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said I, \"the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as\r\never. How is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon\r\nabout 'devil's seats,' 'death's-heads,' and 'bishop's hotels'?\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess,\" replied Legrand, \"that the matter still wears a serious\r\naspect, when regarded with a casual glance. My first endeavor was to\r\ndivide the sentence into the natural division intended by the\r\ncryptographist.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, to punctuate it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something of that kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how was it possible to effect this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I reflected that it had been a _point_ with the writer to run his\r\nwords together without division, so as to increase the difficulty of\r\nsolution.  Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing such an object,\r\nwould be nearly certain to overdo the matter.  When, in the course of\r\nhis composition, he arrived at a break in his subject which would\r\nnaturally require a pause, or a point, he would be exceedingly apt to\r\nrun his characters, at this place, more than usually close\r\ntogether. If you will observe the MS., in the present instance, you\r\nwill easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding. Acting on this\r\nhint, I made the division thus:\r\n\r\n\"'_A good glass in the bishop's hostel in the devil's seat--twenty-one\r\ndegrees and thirteen minutes--northeast and by north--main branch\r\nseventh limb east side--shoot from the left eye of the deaths-head--a\r\n\r\nbee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Even this division,\" said I, \"leaves me still in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"It left me also in the dark,\" replied Legrand, \"for a few days;\r\nduring which I made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of\r\nSullivan's Island, for any building which went by the name of the\r\n'Bishop's Hotel'; for, of course, I dropped the obsolete word\r\n'hostel.' Gaining no information on the subject, I was on the point of\r\nextending my sphere of search, and proceeding in a more systematic\r\nmanner, when one morning it entered into my head, quite suddenly, that\r\nthis 'Bishop's Hostel' might have some reference to an old family, of\r\nthe name of Bessop, which, time out of mind, had held possession of an\r\nancient manor-house, about four miles to the northward of the\r\nisland. I accordingly went over to the plantation, and reinstituted my\r\ninquiries among the older negroes of the place. At length one of the\r\nmost aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as\r\n_Bessop's Castle_, and thought that she could guide me to it, but that\r\nit was not a castle, nor a tavern, but a high rock.\r\n\r\n\"I offered to pay her well for her trouble, and, after some demur, she\r\nconsented to accompany me to the spot. We found it without much\r\ndifficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded to examine the place.\r\nThe 'castle' consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and\r\nrocks--one of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well\r\nas for its insulated and artificial appearance. I clambered to its\r\napex, and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done.\r\n\r\n\"While I was busied in reflection, my eyes fell on a narrow ledge in\r\nthe eastern face of the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit upon\r\nwhich I stood. This ledge projected about eighteen inches, and was not\r\nmore than a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just above it gave\r\nit a rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our\r\nancestors. I made no doubt that here was the 'devil's seat' alluded to\r\nin the MS., and now I seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle.\r\n\r\n\"The 'good glass,' I knew, could have reference to nothing but a\r\ntelescope; for the word 'glass' is rarely employed in any other sense\r\nby seamen. Now here, I at once saw, was a telescope to be used, and a\r\ndefinite point of view, _admitting no variation_, from which to use\r\nit. Nor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, 'twenty-one\r\ndegrees and thirteen minutes,' and 'northeast and by north,' were\r\nintended as directions for the levelling of the glass. Greatly excited\r\nby these discoveries, I hurried home, procured a telescope, and\r\nreturned to the rock.\r\n\r\n\"I let myself down to the ledge, and found that it was impossible to\r\nretain a seat on it unless in one particular position.  This fact\r\nconfirmed my preconceived idea. I proceeded to use the glass. Of\r\ncourse, the 'twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes' could allude to\r\nnothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal\r\ndirection was clearly indicated by the words, 'northeast and by\r\nnorth.' This latter direction I at once established by means of a\r\npocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of\r\ntwenty-one degrees of elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it\r\ncautiously up or down, until my attention was arrested by a circular\r\nrift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that over-topped its\r\nfellows in the distance. In the centre of this rift I perceived a\r\nwhite spot, but could not, at first, distinguish what it was.\r\nAdjusting the focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now made it\r\nout to be a human skull.\r\n\r\n\"On this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved;\r\nfor the phrase 'main branch, seventh limb, east side,' could refer\r\nonly to the position of the skull on the tree, while 'shoot from the\r\nleft eye of the death's-head' admitted, also, of but one\r\ninterpretation, in regard to a search for buried treasure. I perceived\r\nthat the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull,\r\nand that a bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line, drawn from\r\nthe nearest point of the trunk through 'the shot' (or the spot where\r\nthe bullet fell), and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet,\r\nwould indicate a definite point--and beneath this point I thought it\r\nat least _possible_ that a deposit of value lay concealed.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this,\" I said, \"is exceedingly clear, and, although ingenious,\r\nstill simple and explicit. When you left the Bishop's Hotel, what\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, having carefully taken the bearings of the tree, I turned\r\nhomewards. The instant that I left 'the devil's seat,' however, the\r\ncircular rift vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of it afterwards,\r\nturn as I would. What seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole\r\nbusiness, is the fact (for repeated experiment has convinced me it\r\n_is_ a fact) that the circular opening in question is visible from no\r\nother attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge\r\non the face of the rock.\r\n\r\n\"In this expedition to the 'Bishop's Hotel' I had been attended by\r\nJupiter, who had no doubt observed, for some weeks past, the\r\nabstraction of my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave me\r\nalone. But on the next day, getting up very early, I contrived to give\r\nhim the slip, and went into the hills in search of the tree. After\r\nmuch toil I found it.  When I came home at night my valet proposed to\r\ngive me a flogging. With the rest of the adventure I believe you are\r\nas well acquainted as myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said I, \"you missed the spot, in the first attempt at\r\ndigging, through Jupiter's stupidity in letting the bug fall through\r\nthe right instead of through the left eye of the skull.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. This mistake made a difference of about two inches and a\r\nhalf in the 'shot'--that is to say, in the position of the peg nearest\r\nthe tree; and had the treasure been _beneath_ the 'shot,' the error\r\nwould have been of little moment; but 'the shot,' together with the\r\nnearest point of the tree, were merely two points for the\r\nestablishment of a line of direction; of course the error, however\r\ntrivial in the beginning, increased as we proceeded with the line,\r\nand, by the time we had gone fifty feet, threw us quite off the\r\nscent. But for my deep-seated convictions that treasure was here\r\nsomewhere actually buried, we might have had all our labor in vain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume the fancy of _the skull_--of letting fall a bullet through\r\nthe skull's eye--was suggested to Kidd by the piratical flag. No doubt\r\nhe felt a kind of poetical consistency in recovering his money through\r\nthis ominous insignium.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so; still, I cannot help thinking that common sense had quite\r\nas much to do with the matter as poetical consistency. To be visible\r\nfrom the devil's seat, it was necessary that the object, if small,\r\nshould be _white_; and there is nothing like your human skull for\r\nretaining and even increasing its whiteness under exposure to all\r\nvicissitudes of weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the beetle--how\r\nexcessively odd! I was sure you were mad.  And why did you insist on\r\nletting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions\r\ntouching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own\r\nway, by a little bit of sober mystification.  For this reason I swung\r\nthe beetle, and for this reason I let it fall from the tree. An\r\nobservation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter\r\nidea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles\r\nme. What are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself.  There\r\nseems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for them--and yet\r\nit is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would\r\nimply. It is clear that Kidd--if Kidd indeed secreted this treasure,\r\nwhich I doubt not--it is clear 30 that he must have had assistance in\r\nthe labor. But, the worst of this labor concluded, he may have thought\r\nit expedient to remove all participants in his secret. Perhaps a\r\ncouple of blows with a mattock were sufficient, while his coadjutors\r\nwere busy in the pit; perhaps it required a dozen--who shall tell?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PURLOINED LETTER\r\n\r\n  Nil sapientiæ odiosius acumine nimio.\r\n                               SENECA\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18--, I\r\nwas enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in\r\ncompany with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library,\r\nor book closet, _au troisième_, No. 33, Rue Dunôt, Faubourg St.\r\nGermain. For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence;\r\nwhile each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and\r\nexclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed\r\nthe atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally\r\ndiscussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation\r\nbetween us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of\r\nthe Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogêt. I\r\nlooked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the\r\ndoor of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old\r\nacquaintance, Monsieur G----, the Prefect of the Parisian police.\r\n\r\nWe gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the\r\nentertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen\r\nhim for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now\r\narose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without\r\ndoing so, upon G----'s saying that he had called to consult us, or\r\nrather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business\r\nwhich had occasioned a great deal of trouble.\r\n\r\n\"If it is any point requiring reflection,\" observed Dupin, as he\r\nforebore to enkindle the wick, \"we shall examine it to better purpose\r\nin the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is another of your odd notions,\" said the Prefect, who had a\r\nfashion of calling everything \"odd\" that was beyond his comprehension,\r\nand thus lived amid an absolute legion of \"oddities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and\r\nrolled towards him a comfortable chair.\r\n\r\n\"And what is the difficulty now?\" I asked. \"Nothing more in the\r\nassassination way, I hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is _very_\r\nsimple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently\r\nwell ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the\r\ndetails of it, because it is so excessively _odd_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Simple and odd,\" said Dupin.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all been\r\na good deal puzzled because the affair _is_ so simple, and yet baffles\r\nus altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at\r\nfault,\" said my friend.\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense you _do_ talk!\" replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the mystery is a little _too_ plain,\" said Dupin.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, good Heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little _too_ self-evident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! ha!--ha! ha! ha!--ho! ho! ho!\" roared our visitor, profoundly\r\namused. \"O Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what, after all, _is_ the matter on hand?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I will tell you,\" replied the Prefect, as he gave a long,\r\nsteady, and contemplative puff, and settle'd himself in his chair.  \"I\r\nwill tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you\r\nthat this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I\r\nshould most probably lose the position I now hold were it known that I\r\nconfided it to any one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proceed,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Or not,\" said Dupin.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high\r\nquarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been\r\npurloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it\r\nis known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known,\r\nalso, that it still remains in his possession.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is this known?\" asked Dupin.\r\n\r\n\"It is clearly inferred,\" replied the Prefect, \"from the nature of the\r\ndocument, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would\r\nat once arise from its passing _out_ of the robber's possession; that\r\nis to say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to\r\nemploy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be a little more explicit,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder\r\na certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely\r\nvaluable.\"  The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.\r\n\r\n\"Still I do not quite understand,\" said Dupin.\r\n\r\n\"No?  well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who\r\nshall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of\r\nmost exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document\r\nan ascendency over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are\r\nso jeopardized.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this ascendency,\" I interposed, \"would depend upon the robber's\r\nknowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber.  Who would dare--\"\r\n\r\n\"The thief,\" said G-------, \"is the Minister D------, who dares all\r\nthings, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man.  The method\r\nof the theft was not less ingenious than bold.  The document in\r\nquestion--a letter, to be frank--had been received by the\r\npersonage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir.  During its perusal\r\nshe was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted\r\npersonage, from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.  After\r\na hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced\r\nto place it, open as it was, upon a table. The address, however, was\r\nuppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped\r\nnotice. At this juncture enters the Minister D----. His lynx eye\r\nimmediately perceives the paper, recognizes the handwriting of the\r\naddress, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and\r\nfathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through\r\nin his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the\r\none in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in\r\nclose juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses for some fifteen\r\nminutes upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes\r\nalso from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful\r\nowner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the\r\npresence of the third personage, who stood at her elbow. The Minister\r\ndecamped, leaving his own letter--one of no importance--upon the\r\ntable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, then,\" said Dupin to me, \"you have precisely what you demand to\r\nmake the ascendancy complete--the robber's knowledge of the loser's\r\nknowledge of the robber.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the Prefect; \"and the power thus attained has, for some\r\nmonths past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous\r\nextent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day,\r\nof the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot\r\nbe done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the\r\nmatter to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Than whom,\" said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, \"no more\r\nsagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.\"\r\n\r\n\"You flatter me,\" replied the Prefect; \"but it is possible that some\r\nsuch opinion may have been entertained.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is clear,\" said I, \"as you observe, that the letter is still in\r\npossession of the Minister; since it is this possession, and not any\r\nemployment of the letter, which bestows the power.  With the\r\nemployment the power departs.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said G----; \"and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first\r\ncare was to make thorough search of the Minister's Hotel; and here my\r\nchief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his\r\nknowledge. Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which\r\nwould result from giving him reason to suspect our design.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said I, \"you are quite _au fait_ in these investigations. The\r\nParisian police have done this thing often before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the\r\nMinister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from\r\nhome all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a\r\ndistance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly\r\nNeapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with\r\nwhich I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a\r\nnight has not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been\r\nengaged, personally, in ransacking the D---- Hotel. My honor is\r\ninterested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So\r\nI did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied the\r\nthief is a more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have\r\ninvestigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is\r\npossible that the paper can be concealed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is it not possible,\" I suggested, \"that although the letter may\r\nbe in possession of the Minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have\r\nconcealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is barely possible,\" said Dupin. \"The present peculiar condition\r\nof affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D----\r\nis known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the\r\ndocument--its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice--a\r\npoint of nearly equal importance with its possession.\"\r\n\r\n\"Its susceptibility of being produced?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"That is to say, of being _destroyed_,\" said Dupin.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" I observed; \"the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As\r\nfor its being upon the person of the Minister, we may consider that as\r\nout of the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Entirely,\" said the Prefect. \"He has been twice waylaid, as if by\r\nfootpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might have spared yourself this trouble,\" said Dupin.  \"D----, I\r\npresume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated\r\nthese waylayings, as a matter of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not _altogether_ a fool,\" said G----, \"but then he's a poet, which I\r\ntake to be only one remove from a fool.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his\r\nmeerschaum, \"although I have been guilty of certain doggerel myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you detail,\" said I, \"the particulars of your search.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the fact is, we took our time, and we searched _everywhere_. I\r\nhave had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building,\r\nroom by room, devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We\r\nexamined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every\r\npossible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained\r\npolice agent, such a thing as a _secret_ drawer is impossible. Any man\r\nis a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of\r\nthis kind. The thing is _so_ plain. There is a certain amount of\r\nbulk--of space--to be accounted for in every cabinet.  Then we have\r\naccurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After\r\nthe cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine\r\nlong needles you have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the\r\ntops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of\r\nfurniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article;\r\nthen the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity,\r\nand the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in\r\nthe same way.\"\r\n\r\n\"But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding\r\nof cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case we were obliged to\r\nproceed without noise.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you could not have removed--you could not have taken to pieces\r\n_all_ articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to\r\nmake a deposit in the manner you mention.  A letter may be compressed\r\ninto a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a\r\nlarge knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the\r\nrung of a chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the\r\nchairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not; but we did better--we examined the rungs of every\r\nchair in the Hotel, and indeed, the jointings of every description of\r\nfurniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been\r\nany traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect\r\nit instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have\r\nbeen as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the gluing--any unusual\r\ngaping in the joints--would have sufficed to insure detection.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the\r\nplates, and you probed the beds and the bedclothes, as well as the\r\ncurtains and carpets?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle\r\nof the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We\r\ndivided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so\r\nthat none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square\r\ninch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately\r\nadjoining, with the microscope, as before.\"\r\n\r\n\"The two houses adjoining!\" I exclaimed; \"you must have had a great\r\ndeal of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had; but the reward offered is prodigious.\"\r\n\r\n\"You include the _grounds_ about the houses?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the grounds are paved with bricks. They gave us comparatively\r\nlittle trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it\r\nundisturbed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You looked among D----'s papers, of course, and into the books of the\r\nlibrary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened\r\nevery book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not\r\ncontenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of\r\nsome of our police officers. We also measured the thickness of every\r\nbook-_cover_, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to\r\neach the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the\r\nbindings been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly\r\nimpossible that the fact should have escaped observation. Some five or\r\nsix volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed,\r\nlongitudinally, with the needles.\"\r\n\r\n\"You explored the floors beneath the carpets?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with\r\nthe microscope.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the paper on the walls?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You looked into the cellars?\"\r\n\r\n\"We did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" I said, \"you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter\r\nis _not_ upon the premises, as you suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear you are right there,\" said the Prefect. \"And now, Dupin, what\r\nwould you advise me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"To make a thorough re-search of the premises.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is absolutely needless,\" replied G----. \"I am not more sure that\r\nI breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no better advice to give you,\" said Dupin.\r\n\r\n\"You have, of course, an accurate description of the letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\"--And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book,\r\nproceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and\r\nespecially of the external appearance of the missing document. Soon\r\nafter finishing the perusal of this description, he took his\r\ndeparture, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known\r\nthe good gentleman before.\r\n\r\nIn about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us\r\noccupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered\r\ninto some ordinary conversation. At length I said,--\r\n\r\n\"Well, but, G----, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at\r\nlast made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the\r\nMinister?\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound him, say I--yes; I made the re-examination, however, as\r\nDupin suggested--but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much was the reward offered, did you say?\" asked Dupin.\r\n\r\n\"Why, a very great deal--a _very_ liberal reward--I don't like to say\r\nhow much, precisely; but one thing I _will_ say, that I wouldn't mind\r\ngiving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who\r\ncould obtain me that letter.  The fact is, it is becoming of more and\r\nmore importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If\r\nit were trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his\r\nmeerschaum, \"I really--think, G----, you have not exerted yourself--to\r\nthe utmost in this matter. You might--do a little more, I think, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"How?--in what way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--puff, puff--you might--puff, puff--employ counsel in the matter,\r\neh?--puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell of\r\nAbernethy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; hang Abernethy!\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain\r\nrich miser conceived the design of sponging upon this Abernethy for a\r\nmedical opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary\r\nconversation in a private company, he insinuated his case to the\r\nphysician, as that of an imaginary individual.\r\n\r\n\"'We will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such and\r\nsuch; now, doctor, what would _you_ have directed him to take?'\r\n\r\n\"'Take!' said Abernethy, 'why, take _advice_, to be sure.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the Prefect, a little discomposed, \"I am _perfectly_\r\nwilling to take advice, and to pay for it. I would _really_ give fifty\r\nthousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a\r\ncheck-book, \"you may as well fill me up a check for the amount\r\nmentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.\"\r\n\r\nI was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken. For\r\nsome minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking\r\nincredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed\r\nstarting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in\r\nsome measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant\r\nstares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand\r\nfrancs, and handed it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined\r\nit carefully and deposited it in his pocketbook; then, unlocking an\r\n_escritoire_, took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This\r\nfunctionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a\r\ntrembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then,\r\nscrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length\r\nunceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having\r\nuttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.\r\n\r\n\"The Parisian police,\" he said, \"are exceedingly able in their\r\nway. They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed\r\nin the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when\r\nG---- detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel\r\nD----, I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory\r\ninvestigation--so far as his labors extended.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far as his labors extended?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Dupin. \"The measures adopted were not only the best of\r\ntheir kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter\r\nbeen deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would,\r\nbeyond a question, have found it.\"\r\n\r\nI merely laughed--but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.\r\n\r\n\"The measures, then,\" he continued, \"were good in their kind, and well\r\nexecuted; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case,\r\nand to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with\r\nthe Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed to which he forcibly adapts his\r\ndesigns. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for\r\nthe matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than\r\nhe. I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in\r\nthe game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game\r\n_is_ simple, and is played with marbles.  One player holds in his hand\r\na number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is\r\neven or odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he\r\nloses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the\r\nschool. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in\r\nmere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his\r\nopponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and,\r\nholding up his closed hand asks, 'Are they even or odd?' Our schoolboy\r\nreplies, 'Odd' and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he\r\nthen says to himself, 'the simpleton had them even upon the first\r\ntrial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have\r\nthem odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd;' he guesses odd,\r\nand wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first he would have\r\nreasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed\r\nodd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first\r\nimpulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first\r\nsimpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too\r\nsimple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as\r\nbefore. I will therefore guess even;' he guesses even, and wins. Now\r\nthis mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows term\r\n'lucky,'--what, in its last analysis, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is merely,\" I said, \"an identification of the reasoner's intellect\r\nwith that of his opponent.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" said Dupin; \"and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he\r\neffected the _thorough_ identification in which his success consisted,\r\nI received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or\r\nhow stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his\r\nthoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as\r\naccurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and\r\nthen wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or\r\nheart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.' This\r\nresponse of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious\r\nprofundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucauld, to La Bruyère,\r\nto Machiavelli, and to Campanella.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the identification,\" I said, \"of the reasoner's intellect with\r\nthat of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the\r\naccuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured.\"\r\n\r\n\"For its practical value it depends upon this,\" replied Dupin, \"and\r\nthe Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of\r\nthis identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather\r\nthrough non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are\r\nengaged. They consider only their _own_ ideas of ingenuity; and, in\r\nsearching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which\r\n_they_ would have hidden it. They are right in this much--that their\r\nown ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of _the mass_: but\r\nwhen the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from\r\ntheir own, the felon foils them, of course. This always happens when\r\nit is above their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no\r\nvariation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by\r\nsome unusual emergency--by some extraordinary reward--they extend or\r\nexaggerate their old modes of _practice_, without touching their\r\nprinciples.  What, for example, in this case of D----, has been done\r\nto vary the principle of action? What is all this boring, and probing,\r\nand sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope, and dividing the\r\nsurface of the building into registered square inches--what is it all\r\nbut an exaggeration _of the application_ of the one principle or set\r\nof principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions\r\nregarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine\r\nof his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for\r\ngranted that _all_ men proceed to conceal a letter,--not exactly in a\r\ngimlet-hole bored in a chair leg--but, at least, in _some_\r\nout-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought\r\nwhich would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a\r\nchair-leg? And do you not see, also, that such _recherchés_ nooks for\r\nconcealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions and would be\r\nadopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment,\r\na disposal of the article concealed--a disposal of it in this\r\n_recherché_ manner--is, in the very first instance, presumable and\r\npresumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen,\r\nbut altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the\r\nseekers; and where the case is of importance--or, what amounts to the\r\nsame thing in policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude--the\r\nqualities in question have _never_ been known to fail. You will now\r\nunderstand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter\r\nbeen hidden anywhere within the limits of the Prefect's\r\nexamination--in other words, had the principle of its concealment been\r\ncomprehended within the principles of the Prefect--its discovery would\r\nhave been a matter altogether beyond question. This functionary,\r\nhowever, has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his\r\ndefeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he\r\nhas acquired renown as a poet.  All fools are poets; this the Prefect\r\n_feels_; and he is merely guilty of a _non distributio medii_ in\r\nthence inferring that all poets are fools.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is this really the poet?\" I asked. \"There are two brothers, I\r\nknow; and both have attained reputation in letters. The Minister, I\r\nbelieve, has written learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a\r\nmathematician, and no poet\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet _and_\r\nmathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could\r\nnot have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the\r\nPrefect.\"\r\n\r\n\"You surprise me,\" I said, \"by these opinions, which have been\r\ncontradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at\r\nnaught the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason\r\nhas long been regarded as _the_ reason _par excellence_.\"\r\n\r\n\"'_Il-y-a à parier_,'\" replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, \"'_que\r\ntoute idée publique, toute convention reçue, est une sottise, car elle\r\na convenue au plus grand nombre_.' The mathematicians, I grant you,\r\nhave done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you\r\nallude, and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as\r\ntruth. With an art worthy a better cause, for example, they have\r\ninsinuated the term 'analysis' into application to algebra. The French\r\nare the originators of this particular deception ; but if a term is of\r\nany importance--if words derive any value from applicability--then\r\n'analysis' conveys 'algebra,' about as much as, in Latin, '_ambitus_'\r\nimplies 'ambition,' '_religio_,' 'religion,' or '_homines honesti_,'a\r\nset of honorable men.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a quarrel on hand, I see,\" said I, \"with some of the\r\nalgebraists of Paris; but proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which\r\nis cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly\r\nlogical. I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical\r\nstudy. The mathematics are the science of form and quantity;\r\nmathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon\r\nform and quantity. The great error lies in supposing that even the\r\ntruths of what is called _pure_ algebra are abstract or general\r\ntruths. And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the\r\nuniversality with which it has been received. Mathematical axioms are\r\n_not_ axioms of general truth. What is true of _relation_--of form and\r\nquantity--is often grossly false in regard to morals, for example. In\r\nthis latter science it is very usually _un_true that the aggregated\r\nparts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In\r\nthe consideration of motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given\r\nvalue, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of\r\ntheir values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which\r\nare only truths within the limits of _relation_. But the mathematician\r\nargues, from his _finite truths_, through habit, as if they were of an\r\nabsolutely general applicability--as the world indeed imagines them to\r\nbe. Bryant, in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentions an analogous\r\nsource of error, when he says that 'although the Pagan fables are not\r\nbelieved, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences\r\nfrom them as existing realities.'  With the algebraists, however, who\r\nare Pagans themselves, the 'Pagan fables' _are_ believed, and the\r\ninferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through\r\nan unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I neyer yet\r\nencountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal\r\nroots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his\r\nfaith that _x²+px_ was absolutely and unconditionally equal to _q_.\r\nSay to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please,\r\nthat you believe occasions may occur where _x²+px_ is _not_\r\naltogether equal to _q_, and, having made him understand what you\r\nmean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond\r\ndoubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.\r\n\r\n\"I mean to say,\" continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his last\r\nobservations, \"that if the Minister had been no more than a\r\nmathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of\r\ngiving me this check. I knew him, however, as both mathematician and\r\npoet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to\r\nthe circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as courtier,\r\ntoo, and as a bold _intriguant_. Such a man, I considered, could not\r\nfail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could\r\nnot have failed to anticipate--and events have proved that he did not\r\nfail to anticipate--the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must\r\nhave foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his\r\npremises. His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed\r\nby the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as\r\nruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and\r\nthus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G----, in\r\nfact, did finally arrive--the conviction that the letter was not upon\r\nthe premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I\r\nwas at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the\r\ninvariable principle of policial action in searches for articles\r\nconcealed--I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily\r\npass through the mind of the Minister. It would imperatively lead him\r\nto despise all the ordinary _nooks_ of concealment.  _He_ could not, I\r\nreflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote\r\nrecess of his Hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the\r\neyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the\r\nPrefect. I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of\r\ncourse, to _simplicity_, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter\r\nof choice.  You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect\r\nlaughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just\r\npossible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so\r\n_very_ self-evident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"I remember his merriment well. I really thought he\r\nwould have fallen into convulsions.\"\r\n\r\n\"The material world,\" continued Dupin, \"abounds with very strict\r\nanalogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been\r\ngiven to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made\r\nto strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description. The\r\nprinciple of the _vis inertiæ_, for example, seems to be identical in\r\nphysics and metaphysics.  It is not more true in the former, that a\r\nlarge body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one,\r\nand that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty,\r\nthan it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity,\r\nwhile more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their\r\nmovements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily\r\nmoved, and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few\r\nsteps of their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the\r\nstreet signs, over the shop-doors, are the most attractive of\r\nattention?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never given the matter a thought,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"There is a game of puzzles,\" he resumed, \"which is played upon a\r\nmap. One party playing requires another to find a given word--the name\r\nof town, river, state, or empire--any word, in short, upon the motley\r\nand perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally\r\nseeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely\r\nlettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large\r\ncharacters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the\r\nover-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape\r\nobservation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the\r\nphysical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral\r\ninapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those\r\nconsiderations which are too obtrusively and too palpably\r\nself-evident.  But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or\r\nbeneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thought it\r\nprobable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter\r\nimmediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best\r\npreventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.\r\n\r\n\"But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating\r\ningenuity of D----; upon the fact that the document must always have\r\nbeen _at hand,_ if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the\r\ndecisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden\r\nwithin the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search--the more\r\nsatisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had\r\nresorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not\r\nattempting to conceal it at all.\r\n\r\n\"Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green\r\nspectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the\r\nMinisterial Hotel. I found D---- at home, yawning, lounging, and\r\ndawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of\r\nennui. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now\r\nalive--but that is only when nobody sees him.\r\n\r\n\"To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the\r\nnecessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and\r\nthoroughly surveyed the apartment, while seemingly intent only upon\r\nthe conversation of my host.\r\n\r\n\"I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat,\r\nand upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other\r\npapers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here,\r\nhowever, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to\r\nexcite particular suspicion.\r\n\r\n\"At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a\r\ntrumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a\r\ndirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of\r\nthe mantelpiece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments,\r\nwere five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last was\r\nmuch soiled and crumpled.  It was torn nearly in two, across the\r\nmiddle--as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up\r\nas worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a\r\nlarge black seal, bearing the D---- cipher _very_ conspicuously, and\r\nwas addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D----, the Minister\r\nhimself. It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed,\r\ncontemptuously, into one of the upper divisions of the rack.\r\n\r\n\"No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be\r\nthat of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance,\r\nradically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so\r\nminute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the\r\nD---- cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the\r\nS---- family.  Here, the address, to the Minister, was diminutive and\r\nfeminine; there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was\r\nmarkedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of\r\ncorrespondence. But then, the _radicalness_ of these differences,\r\nwhich was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the\r\npaper, so inconsistent with the _true_ methodical habits of D----, and\r\nso suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the\r\nworthlessness of the document; these things, together with the\r\nhyperobtrusive situation of this document, full in the view of every\r\nvisitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which\r\nI had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly\r\ncorroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to\r\nsuspect.\r\n\r\n\"I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a\r\nmost animated discussion with the Minister, upon a topic which I knew\r\nwell had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention\r\nreally riveted upon the letter.  In this examination, I committed to\r\nmemory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also\r\nfell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial\r\ndoubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the\r\npaper, I observed them to be more _chafed_ than seemed necessary. They\r\npresented the _broken_ appearance which is manifested when a stiff\r\npaper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded\r\nin a reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed\r\nthe original fold.  This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me\r\nthat the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed,\r\nand re-sealed. I bade the Minister good-morning, and took my departure\r\nat once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite\r\neagerly, the conversation of the preceding day.  While thus engaged,\r\nhowever, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately\r\nbeneath the windows of the Hotel, and was succeeded by a series of\r\nfearful screams, and the shoutings of a mob. D---- rushed to a\r\ncasement, threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to\r\nthe card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it\r\nby a facsimile (so far as regards externals), which I had carefully\r\nprepared at my lodgings--imitating the D---- cipher, very readily, by\r\nmeans of a seal formed of bread.\r\n\r\n\"The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic\r\nbehavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of\r\nwomen and children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and\r\nthe fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When\r\nhe had gone, D---- came from the window, whither I had followed him\r\nimmediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade\r\nhim farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what purpose had you,\" I asked, \"in replacing the letter by a\r\nfacsimile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have\r\nseized it openly, and departed?\"\r\n\r\n\"D----,\" replied Dupin, \"is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His\r\nHotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I\r\nmade the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the\r\nMinisterial presence alive. The good 30 people of Paris might have\r\nheard of me no more. But I had an object apart from these\r\nconsiderations. You know my political prepossessions. In this matter,\r\nI act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the\r\nMinister has had her in his power. She has now him in hers--since,\r\nbeing unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will\r\nproceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will he inevitably\r\ncommit himself, at once, to his political destruction. His downfall,\r\ntoo, will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very well to\r\ntalk about the _facilis descensus Averni_; but in all kinds of\r\nclimbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up\r\nthan to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy--at\r\nleast no pity--for him who descends. He is that _monstrum horrendum_,\r\nan unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I should like\r\nvery well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being\r\ndefied by her whom the Prefect terms 'a certain personage,' he is\r\nreduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How? Did you put anything particular in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior\r\nblank--that would have been insulting. D----, at Vienna once, did me\r\nan evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should\r\nremember. So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the\r\nidentity of the person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not\r\nto give him a clew. He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just\r\ncopied into the middle of the blank sheet the words--\r\n\r\n  '--Un dessein si funeste,\r\n  S'il n'est digne d'Atrée, est digne de Thyeste.'\r\n\r\nThey are to be found in Crébillon's _Atrée_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe text followed both for poems and tales is that of the\r\nStedman-Woodberry edition of Poe's Works, in which the editors\r\nfollowed, in most cases, the text of what is known as the \"Lorimer\r\nGraham\" copy of the edition of 1845, containing marginal corrections\r\nin Poe's own hand. Poe revised his work frequently and sometimes\r\nextensively. The following notes show, in most cases, the dates both\r\nof the first publication and of subsequent ones. Familiarity with the\r\nIntroduction to this book will, in some cases, be necessary to an\r\nunderstanding of the notes. Gayley's \"Classic Myths in English\r\nLiterature\" (Ginn & Company, $1.50) is the best reference work of\r\nsmall size for allusions to mythology, and should be available.\r\n\r\nBoth poems and tales are arranged in chronological order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG (Page 3)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1827, 1829, and 1845. The poem is believed to refer to\r\nMiss Royster, of Richmond, with whom Poe was in love as a boy of\r\nsixteen, shortly before he entered the University of Virginia. The\r\nyoung lady's father intercepted the correspondence, and Miss Royster\r\nsoon became Mrs. Shelton. The blush, mentioned in lines 2, 9, and 14,\r\nis doubtless intended to imply shame for her desertion. The poem is\r\ncommonplace, and shows little that is characteristic of the older Poe.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIRITS OF THE DEAD (Page 3)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1827 as \"Visit of the Dead,\" and in 1829 and 1839 under\r\nthe above title. It has been conjectured that this poem was inspired\r\nby the death of Mrs. Stannard (see Introduction, page xii).\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ---- (Page 4)\r\n\r\nThe original, longer and addressed \"To M----,\" appeared in the edition\r\nof 1829, and was republished in 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMANCE (Page 5)\r\n\r\nPrinted as a preface in 1829, and as an introduction in 1831;\r\nconsiderably revised and shortened, it appeared in 1843 and 1845 as\r\n\"Romance.\"\r\n\r\n11. condor years. The metaphor implies a likeness of time--the\r\nyears--to a bird of prey. Cf. \"condor wings\" in \"The Conqueror Worm.\"\r\n\r\n19. forbidden things: i.e. \"lyre and rhyme.\" What is the meaning?\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE RIVER-- (Page 5)\r\n\r\nPublished first in 1829, afterwards in several magazines and in the\r\nedition of 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SCIENCE (Page 6)\r\n\r\nPublished first in 1829, this poem appeared in editions of 1831 and\r\n1845, and in magazines. It is a sonnet, differing from the\r\nShakespearean form only in the repetition of the rhyme with \"eyes.\"\r\n\r\n9, 10, 12. In classical mythology, Diana is the moon goddess,\r\nHamadryad, a wood nymph, Naiad, a water nymph. Consult Gayley's\r\n\"Classic Myths.\" Explain the figures of speech.\r\n\r\n13. Elfin: elf, a fairy, from the Anglo-Saxon, refers especially to\r\ntiny sprites, fond of mischief and tricks. But there were various\r\nkinds of elves, according to the Norse mythology. Consult Gayley's\r\n\"Classic Myths.\" Explain the figure.\r\n\r\n14. tamarind-tree: a beautiful, spreading, Oriental tree, with pinnate\r\nleaves and showy racemes of yellow flowers variegated with red. What\r\ndoes the line mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HELEN (Page 7)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1831, 1836, 1841, 1843, and 1845. Read comment in the\r\nIntroduction, pages xii and xxiii.\r\n\r\n2. Nicæan barks. It is impossible to say exactly what this allusion\r\nmeans. Professor W.P. Trent aptly suggests that if \"wanderer\" in line\r\n4 refers to Ulysses, as seems likely, \"Phæacian\" would have been the\r\nright word, since the Phæacians did convey Ulysses to Ithaca. Poe may\r\nhave had that idea in mind and used the wrong word, or this may simply\r\nbe a characteristically vague suggestion of antiquity. Point out\r\nsimilar examples of indefinite suggestion in this poem.\r\n\r\n7. hyacinth hair: a favorite term with Poe. In \"The Assignation\" he\r\nsays of the Marchesa Aphrodite, \"Her hair ... clustered round and\r\nround her classical head, in curls like those of the young hyacinth.\"\r\nThe hair of Ligeia, in the story of that title, he calls \"the\r\nraven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling tresses,\r\nsetting forth the full force of the Homeric epithet, 'hyacinthine.'\"\r\n\r\n8. Naiad airs: suggestive of exquisite grace. The Naiads, in\r\nclassical mythology, are water nymphs,--lovely maidens presiding over\r\nbrooks and fountains.\r\n\r\n9, 10. Two of Poe's best and most frequently quoted lines. Explain the\r\nfitness of the epithets. Originally the lines read:\r\n\r\n  To the beauty of fair Greece\r\n  And the grandeur of old Rome.\r\n\r\nIs the change an improvement? Explain.\r\n\r\n14. Psyche: the Greek word for \"soul,\" and also the name of a\r\nbeautiful maiden whom Cupid himself loved and wedded. Read the story\r\nin Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nISRAFEL (Page 7)\r\n\r\nPublished in editions of 1831 and 1845, and several times in\r\nmagazines. See comment in the Introduction, page xxiii. Poe derived\r\nthe quotation through Moore's \"Lalla Rookh,\" altered it slightly, and\r\ninterpolated the clause, \"whose heart-strings are a lute\"; it is from\r\nSale's \"Preliminary Discourse\" to the Koran.\r\n\r\n12. levin, or leven: an archaic word for \"lightning.\"\r\n\r\n13. Pleiads, or Pleiades: a group of stars in the constellation\r\nTaurus; only six stars of the group are readily visible, but legend\r\ntells of a seventh, lost. Read the account of the ancient myth in\r\nGayley's \"Classic Myths.\"\r\n\r\n23. skies: the object of \"trod.\"\r\n\r\n26. Houri: derived from an Arabian word meaning \"to have\r\nbrilliant black eyes.\" It is the name in Mohammedan tradition for\r\nbeautiful nymphs of Paradise, who are to be companions of the pious.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CITY IN THE SEA (Page 9)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1831 as \"The Doomed City,\" in 1836 as \"The City of Sin,\"\r\nand several times in 1845 under the above title.\r\n\r\nPoint out examples of alliteration.\r\n\r\n18. Babylon-like walls. The walls of the ancient city of\r\nBabylon, on the Euphrates, were famous for massiveness and extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLEEPER (Page 11)\r\n\r\nPublished as \"Irene\" in 1831 and 1836, and as \"The Sleeper\" in 1843\r\nand 1845. The theme is Poe's favorite, the death of a beautiful young\r\nwoman, and the poem is remarkable, even among Poe's, for its melody.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENORE (Page 13)\r\n\r\nPublished as \"A Pæan\" in 1831 and 1836, and as \"Lenore\" in 1843 and\r\n1845. It was much altered in its numerous revisions.\r\n\r\n1. broken is the golden bowl. See Ecclesiastes xii. 6.\r\n\r\n2. Stygian river. The Styx was a river of Hades, across which\r\nthe souls of the dead had to be ferried.\r\n\r\n3. Guy De Vere: the mourning lover. It is he who speaks in the\r\nsecond and fourth stanzas.\r\n\r\n13. Peccavimus: literally, \"we have sinned.\" This stanza is the\r\nreply of the false friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF UNREST (Page 14)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1831 as \"The Valley Nis,\" with an obscure allusion to a\r\n\"Syriac Tale\":\r\n\r\n  Something about Satan's dart--\r\n  Something about angel wings--\r\n  Much about a broken heart--\r\n  All about unhappy things:\r\n  But \"the Valley Nis\" at best\r\n  Means \"the Valley of Unrest.\"\r\n\r\nLater it was published in magazines and in the 1845 edition, revised\r\nand improved, and transformed into a simple landscape picture,--one of\r\nthe strange, weird, unearthly landscapes so characteristic of Poe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLISEUM (Page 15)\r\n\r\nThis poem was submitted in the prize contest in Baltimore in 1833, and\r\nwould have been successful but for the fact that the author's story,\r\n\"The Manuscript Found in a Bottle,\" had taken the first prize in its\r\nclass. It was republished several times, but not much altered. The\r\nusual spelling is \"Colosseum.\" It is very unlikely that Poe ever saw\r\nthe Colosseum, though it is barely possible his foster parents may\r\nhave taken him to Rome during the English residence (see Introduction,\r\npage xii).\r\n\r\n13-14. Apparently a reference to Jesus, but characteristically vague.\r\n\r\n15-16. The ancient Chaldeans were famous students of the heavens and\r\npracticed fortune telling by the stars; during the Middle Ages\r\nastrologers were commonly called \"Chaldeans.\"\r\n\r\n17. hero fell. Explain the allusion. Read an account of the\r\nColosseum in a history or reference book.\r\n\r\n18. mimic eagle: the eagle on the Roman standard.\r\n\r\n20. gilded hair: adorned with golden ornaments.\r\n\r\n26-29. arcades, plinths, shafts, entablatures, frieze,\r\ncornices. Consult the dictionary and explain these architectural\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n36. Memnon: a gigantic statue of this Greek hero on the banks\r\nof the Nile was said to salute the rising sun with a musical note.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYMN (Page 16)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1835 in the tale \"Morella,\" and several times afterward\r\nin magazines and collections. As an expression of simple, religious\r\ntrust and hope, this poem stands quite apart from all others by Poe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ONE IN  PARADISE (Page 17)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1835 as part of the tale called \"The Visionary,\"\r\nafterward \"The Assignation\"; in 1839 in a magazine under the title \"To\r\nIanthe in Heaven\"; and several times afterward in magazines and in\r\ncollections. It fits admirably into the story \"The Assignation,\" where\r\nit contains this additional stanza, readily understood in its setting:\r\n\r\n  Alas! for that accursed time\r\n    They bore thee o'er the billow,\r\n  From Love to titled age and crime\r\n    And an unholy pillow--\r\n  From me, and from our misty clime\r\n    Where weeps the silver willow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO F---- (Page 18)\r\n\r\nAppeared in 1835 under the title \"To Mary,\" and in 1842 and 1843, \"To\r\nOne Departed.\" It is not known to whom these forms were addressed. In\r\n1845 it again appeared with the above title, which is believed to\r\nrefer to Mrs. Frances Sargent Osgood, a poet of the time, whom Poe\r\ngreatly admired.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO F----S S. O----D (Page 18)\r\n\r\nFirst appeared in the _Southern Literary Messenger_(1835) as \"Lines\r\nWritten in an Album,\" addressed to Eliza White, a young daughter of\r\nthe editor of the _Messenger_; in 1839 the same lines were addressed\r\n\"To ----,\" whose name is unknown; and in 1845 they were addressed\r\nunder the above title to Mrs. Osgood (see note on the preceding poem).\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ZANTE (Page 18)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1837, 1843, and 1845. In form this is a regular\r\nShakespearean sonnet. Zante is one of the principal Ionian islands, in\r\nancient times called Zacynthus. Again the poet writes of a fair isle\r\nin the sea; point out other instances. Note the fondness for \"no\r\nmore,\" and find examples in other poems. As usual with Poe, the thread\r\nof thought is slight and indefinite; apparently the beautiful island\r\nhas become \"accursed ground\" because of the death there of the \"maiden\r\nthat is no more.\"\r\n\r\n1. fairest of all flowers. There is a zantewood, or satinwood,\r\nbut it does not take its name from this island. Poe associated the\r\nname of the island with the hyacinth, but there is no etymological\r\nconnection.  He probably derived his fancy from a passage in\r\nChateaubriand's \"Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem,\" page 53.\r\n\r\n13. hyacinthine isle: a reference to the flowers of the island\r\n(see preceding note).\r\n\r\n14. \"Isola d'oro!  Fior di Levante!\" \"Golden Isle! Flower of\r\nthe Levant!\" These are Italian terms for Zante; they occur in the\r\npassage in Chateaubriand referred to in the note on line 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIDAL BALLAD (Page 19)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1837, 1841, 1845, and greatly improved in revision. The\r\nbride remembers her dead lover who died in battle, and wonders\r\nfearfully whether \"the dead who is forsaken\" knows and is unhappy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILENCE (Page 20)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1840, 1843, and 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEROR WORM (Page 21)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1843 and 1845. The repulsive imagery recurs in several of\r\nthe tales and poems, and shows one of the most morbid phases of Poe's\r\nimagination (see Introduction, page xxiv). It would hardly meet Poe's\r\nown test of beauty, but the grim power of this terrible picture is\r\npalpable enough.\r\n\r\n9. Mimes: actors, who in this case are men; mankind.\r\n\r\n13. vast formless things: doubtless the Fates (consult Gayley's\r\n\"Classic Myths\"); at any rate beings who exercise the same powers.\r\n\r\n15. condor wings. The condor is a great vulture of South\r\nAmerica; the word here suggests the Fates preying on human happiness,\r\nhealth, and life.\r\n\r\n18. Phantom: happiness, or perhaps any object of human desire\r\nor ambition.\r\n\r\n\r\nDREAM-LAND (Page 22)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1844 and 1845. The poem paints another of Poe's\r\nextraordinary landscapes.\r\n\r\n3. Eidolon: phantom, specter, shade.\r\n\r\n6. ultimate dim Thule. \"Thule\" was used by the ancients to\r\nindicate extreme northern regions; the Romans used the phrase \"Ultima\r\nThule\" to denote the most remote, unknown land. What does the allusion\r\nsignify here?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAVEN (Page 24)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1845 in various magazines, first in the New York _Evening\r\nMirror_ of January 29. This is the most famous if not the best of\r\nPoe's poems. There is a clear thread of narrative and greater dramatic\r\ninterest than in any other of the author's poems. If possible, read\r\n\"The Philosophy of Composition,\" in which Poe gives a remarkable\r\naccount of the composition of this poem, an account which is to be\r\naccepted, however, as explaining only the mechanical side of the\r\nwork. This essay is included in Cody's \"Best Poems and Essays\" (see\r\nBibliography, page xxxi). Read the comment in the Introduction, page\r\nxxiv. Note the numerous alliterations.\r\n\r\n34. thereat is. Was the idea phrased this way for any other\r\npurpose than to make a rhyme? Is it artistic?\r\n\r\n\r\n38. Raven. Read an account of the bird in a natural history or\r\nan encyclopedia; it is frequently mentioned in English literature as a\r\nbird of ill omen.\r\n\r\n41. Pallas: Minerva, goddess of wisdom. Consult Gayley's\r\n\"Classic Myths.\" Is a bust of Pallas appropriate for a library?\r\n\r\n47. Plutonian: from Pluto, god of the underworld.\r\n\r\n64, 65. burden: thought or theme.\r\n\r\n76-77. gloated ... gloating. It is impossible to say just what\r\nis suggested. It is characteristically vague. Find other examples in\r\nthis poem.\r\n\r\n80. tinkled on the tufted floor. Not very easy to imagine. In\r\n\"Ligeia,\" Poe speaks of \"carpets of tufted gold,\" apparently meaning\r\nfabrics of very thick and rich material. Perhaps we may think of the\r\ntinkling as proceeding from tiny bells.\r\n\r\n81. \"Wretch,\" etc. The lover addresses himself.\r\n\r\n82. nepenthe: a name given in Homer's \"Odyssey\" to a drug\r\noffered to Helen in Egypt, the effect of which was to banish all grief\r\nand pain.  Later the term was sometimes used for opium.\r\n\r\n89. balm in Gilead. Gilead is a district on the banks of the\r\nJordan and the \"balm\" an herb of reputed medicinal value. The allusion\r\nhere is to Jeremiah viii.22: \"Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no\r\nphysician there?\" The lover means to ask if there is any remedy for\r\nhis sorrow, any consolation. Perhaps he means, \"Is there any solace\r\nafter death?\" or \"Is there any solace either in this world or the\r\nnext?\"\r\n\r\n93. Aidenn: Eden, Paradise, from the Arabic form _Adn_; coined\r\nby Poe for the rhyme.\r\n\r\n101. This line, Poe said in \"The Philosophy of Composition,\" first\r\nbetrays clearly the allegorical nature of the poem.\r\n\r\n106. the lamp-light o'er him streaming. In answer to criticism\r\non this line, Poe explained, \"My conception was that of the bracket\r\ncandelabrum affixed against the wall, high up above the door and bust,\r\nas is often seen in the English palaces, and even in some of the\r\nbetter houses of New York.\"\r\n\r\n107, 108. In these last lines the allegory is fully revealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEULALIE (Page 29)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1845 with the subtitle, \"A Song.\"\r\n\r\n19. Astarte. See note on line 37 of \"Ulalume,\" page 189.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M.L. S----- (Page 30)\r\n\r\nPublished March 13, 1847, and addressed to Mrs. Marie Louise Shew, who\r\nhad been a veritable angel of mercy in the Poe home. She relieved the\r\npoverty and helped to care for Virginia (who died January 29), and\r\nafterward nursed Poe himself during his severe illness.  Mrs. Shew had\r\nhad some medical training and probably saved Poe's life. This brief\r\npoem is instinct with a gratitude and reverence easy to understand,\r\nand is, for Poe, unusually spontaneous.\r\n\r\n\r\nULALUME (Page 30)\r\n\r\nPublished in December, 1847, and in January, 1848. The earlier form\r\ncontained an additional stanza, afterward wisely omitted. Read the\r\ncomment on the poem in the Introduction, pages xxiv-xxv.\r\n\r\n5. Immemorial: properly means extending indefinitely into the\r\npast. Poe may mean that the year has seemed endless to him, but\r\napparently he uses the word in the sense of memorable.\r\n\r\n6, 7. Auber rhymes with October, Weir with year; the\r\nnames were coined by Poe for rhyme and tone color. Note the\r\nresemblance of \"Weir\" to \"weird.\"\r\n\r\n8. tarn: a small mountain lake. It is used provincially in\r\nEngland to mean a boggy or marshy tract. Poe used the word to signify\r\na dark, stagnant pool. Cf. \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" page 49.\r\n\r\n11. cypress.  What is its significance?\r\n\r\n12. Psyche: soul. Cf. note on line 14 of \"To Helen,\" page 183.\r\n\r\n14. scoriac: a very rare word, from _scoria_ (lava).\r\n\r\n16. Yaanek: another specially coined word.\r\n\r\n35. crescent: suggesting hope.\r\n\r\n37, 39. Astarte: a Phoenician goddess, as the deity of love\r\ncorresponding to Venus (Aphrodite), and as moon goddess to Dian, or\r\nDiana (Artemis). But Diana was chaste and cold to the advances of\r\nlovers, which explains \"she (Astarte) is warmer than Dian.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n43. where the worm never dies: implies the gnawing of unending\r\ngrief. Cf. Isaiah lxvi. 24, and Mark ix. 44, 46, 48.\r\n\r\n44.  The Lion: the constellation Leo.\r\n\r\n64. sibyllic: usually \"sibylline,\" prophetic; from \"sibyl.\"\r\nConsult Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\"\r\n\r\n179. legended tomb: having on it an inscription.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ---- ---- (Page 33)\r\n\r\nPublished in March, 1848, and is another tribute to Mrs. Shew. See\r\nnote on \"To M.L. S-----,\" page 188.\r\n\r\n9-10. The quotation is from George Peele's \"David and Bethsabe,\" an\r\nEnglish drama published in 1599:\r\n\r\n   Or let the dew be sweeter far than that\r\n   That hangs, like chains of pearl, on Hermon hill.\r\n\r\n14-15. Cf. the poem \"Israfel,\" and the notes on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ENIGMA (Page 34)\r\n\r\nPublished in March, 1848. To find the name, read the first letter of\r\nthe first line, the second letter of the second line, and so on. In\r\nform this is a sonnet irregular in rhyme scheme.\r\n\r\n1. Solomon Don Dunce: a fanciful name for a stupid person.\r\n\r\n6. Petrarchan stuff: of or by Petrarch (1304-1374), a famous\r\nItalian writer of sonnets.\r\n\r\n10. tuckermanities: a contemptuous allusion to the poetic\r\nefforts of Henry T. Tuckerman, a New England writer of the day.\r\n\r\n14. dear names: Sarah Anna Lewis, a verse writer of the day,\r\nwhom Poe admired.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HELEN (Page 35)\r\n\r\nPublished in November, 1848; addressed to Mrs. Sarah Helen Whitman\r\n(see Introduction, page xvii). Although her engagement to marry Poe\r\nwas broken off, she continued to admire him and was faithful to his\r\nmemory after his death. The poem was written before Poe met Mrs.\r\nWhitman, and is said to have been suggested by the poet's having\r\ncaught a glimpse of the lady walking in a garden by moonlight.\r\n\r\n48. Dian:  Diana, the moon goddess.\r\n\r\n66. Venuses: refers at once to the planet Venus and to Venus,\r\ngoddess of love.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VALENTINE (Page 37)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1849. The name is found as in \"An Enigma,\" by reading the\r\nfirst letter of the first line, the second of the second, and so on.\r\n\r\n2. twins of Leda: Castor and Pollux, two stars in the\r\nconstellation Gemini. For the myth consult Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\"\r\n\r\n3. her own sweet name: Frances Sargent Osgood. See note on the\r\nlines \"To F---- ,\" page 185.\r\n\r\n10. Gordian knot.   Explain this; consult an encyclopedia.\r\n\r\n14. perdus: lost, a French word introduced to rhyme with \"too.\"\r\n\r\n17. lying: used in a double sense.\r\n\r\n18. Mendez Ferdinando Pinto, a Portuguese traveler (1509-1583),\r\nwas said to have been the first white man to visit Japan. He wrote an\r\naccount of his travels, which at the time was considered mere\r\nromancing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR ANNIE (Page 37)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1849, and addressed to Mrs. Richmond of Lowell,\r\nMassachusetts.  This is the \"Annie\" so frequently referred to in\r\nbiographies of Poe, who also figures in his correspondence. Of all the\r\nwomen associated with Poe's later years (see Introduction, pages ),\r\n\"Annie\" was the object of his most sincere and ardent friendship, and\r\nwas his confidant in all his troubles,--including the courtship of\r\nMrs. Whitman. Poe and Mrs. Clemm were frequent visitors at her home,\r\nand the latter found shelter there for a time after her \"Eddie's\"\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThis poem is usually regarded as one of the author's poorest, though\r\nit has a distinctly individual character that must be recognized. Thus\r\nProfessor C.F. Richardson, in his \"American Literature,\" quoting\r\nseveral stanzas, remarks, \"This is doggerel, but it is Poe's special\r\ndoggerel.\"  Some of the lines really deserve this severe epithet, but\r\nhardly the entire poem. Its theme seems to be peace in death through\r\nthe affection of Annie, following a life of passion and sorrow, and so\r\nregarded, it has some strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BELLS (Page 41)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1849. Read the comment on this poem in the Introduction,\r\npage xxv. Though not especially characteristic of him, this is one of\r\nPoe's most remarkable poems, as well as one of the most popular. A\r\nvery interesting account of its composition may be found in\r\nWoodberry's biography, pages 302-304, or in Harrison's biography,\r\npages 286-288, or in the Stedman-Woodberry edition of Poe's Works,\r\nVol. X, pages 183-186.\r\n\r\n10. Runic. Runes are the characters of the alphabet of the\r\nearly Germanic peoples. The allusion is intended to suggest mystery\r\nand magic. Consult an unabridged dictionary or an encyclopedia.\r\n\r\n\r\n23. gloats. What does the word mean here? Cf. line 76 of \"The\r\nRaven,\" and corresponding notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNABEL LEE (Page 44)\r\n\r\nPublished in the _New York Tribune, _October 9, 1849, two days after\r\nthe poet's death. Read the comment in the Introduction, page xxv. Note\r\nthe mid-rhymes in line 26, \"chilling and killing,\" and in line 32,\r\n\"ever dissever\"; point out other examples in \"The Raven\" and other\r\npoems.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MY MOTHER (Page 46)\r\n\r\nPublished in 1849; in form, a regular Shakespearean sonnet. It is a\r\nsincere tribute addressed to Mrs. Clemm, mother of Poe's girl wife,\r\nVirginia, a woman who was more than worthy of it. The tenderest\r\naffection existed between the two, and Mrs. Clemm cared for him after\r\nVirginia's death and grieved profoundly at his own. She lived until\r\n1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nELDORADO (Page 46)\r\n\r\nThis first appeared in the Griswold edition of 1850; no earlier\r\npublication is known. It was probably Poe's last composition, and this\r\nstory of the knight's quest, its failure, and his gaze turned to \"the\r\nValley of the Shadow,\" is a fitting finale for the ill-starred poet\r\n(see comment in the Introduction, page xxv).\r\n\r\nEldorado: a fabled city or country abounding in gold and\r\nprecious stones, and afterward any place of great wealth. The word is\r\noften used figuratively. In a preface to an early volume of his\r\npoetry, Poe alludes quite incidentally to \"the poet's own kingdom--his\r\nEl Dorado,\" and in this sense the metaphor may be accepted here.\r\n\r\nNote the varying sense of the recurring rhyme, shadow. In the\r\nfirst stanza it is simply contrasted with the \"sunshine\" or happiness\r\nof life, in the second it implies the coming of discouragement and\r\ndespair, in the third it is the shadow of death cast before, in the\r\nfourth the Valley of the Shadow of Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAUNTED PALACE (Page 59)\r\n\r\nPublished in the _Baltimore Museum_ in April, 1839, and in September\r\nof the same year in _Burton's Gentleman's Magazine_ as part of the\r\ntale \"The Fall of the House of Usher\"; afterwards published in 1840,\r\n1843, and 1845. It was altered very slightly in revision. Lowell wrote\r\nthat he knew of no modern poet who might not justly be proud of it\r\n(see Introduction, pages xxiii-xxiv).\r\n\r\n59. 24. Porphyrogene: from Greek words meaning \"purple\"\r\nand \"begotten,\" hence, born in the purple, royal. This term, or\r\n\"porphyrogenitus,\" was applied in the Byzantine empire to children of\r\nthe monarch born after his accession to the throne. It is not clear\r\nwhether the word is used here as a descriptive adjective or as the\r\nname of the monarch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER (Page 49)\r\n\r\nPublished first in 1839, and several times reprinted with revisions.\r\nRead the comment in the Introduction, page xxvii. Lowell said of this\r\nstory: \"Had its author written nothing else, it would alone have been\r\nenough to stamp him as a man of genius, and a master of a classic\r\nstyle.\"\r\n\r\nThis tale is one of the best to study as an example of the application\r\nof Poe's critical theory of the short story (see Introduction, page\r\nxxvi).  What is the \"effect\" sought? Is the main incident of the tale\r\nwell adapted to produce this effect? Are the parts skillfully related\r\nto one another and to the whole? Is the setting suitable to the theme?\r\nWhat is the effect of the first sentence? Pick out a number of rather\r\nunusual words which Poe seems particularly to like; observe their\r\neffect. The adjectives are especially worth study; in the first\r\nsentence try the effect of substituting for \"soundless,\" \"quiet,\" or\r\n\"silent,\" or \"noiseless.\"\r\n\r\n49. Quotation: \"His heart is a suspended lute; as soon as it is\r\ntouched it resounds.\" P.J. Béranger (1780-1857), a popular French\r\nlyric poet.\r\n\r\n50. 12. black and lurid tarn: see note to line 8 of \"Ulalume,\"\r\npage 189. Tarn is one of several words Poe particularly liked.\r\n\r\n58. 10. low cunning. See if the reason for this encounter\r\nappears later.\r\n\r\n58 31. ennuyé: a French word meaning \"wearied,\" \"bored.\"\r\n\r\n54. 5-24. The description of Usher is in the main a remarkably good\r\nportrait of Poe himself.\r\n\r\n55. 20-30. Observe the extreme to which Poe goes in this study of\r\nterror; it is the fear of fear that oppresses Usher.\r\n\r\n56. 2. too shadowy here to be re-stated.  Note the effect of\r\nmaking this weird suggestion instead of a clear statement.\r\n\r\n57. 26. Von Weber (1786-1826), a famous German composer.\r\n\r\n58. 5. Henry Fuseli, or Fuesli (1742-1825), as he was known in\r\nEngland, was born in Zurich, Switzerland, and named Johann Heinrich\r\nFuessli. He was a professor in the Royal Academy and painted a series\r\nof highly imaginative pictures illustrating Shakespeare and Milton.\r\n\r\n59. The Haunted Palace. For notes see page 192.\r\n\r\n60. 30-31. Richard Watson (1737-1816), Bishop of Llandaff, was\r\nfor a time professor of chemistry at Cambridge University and wrote\r\npopular essays on that subject. James Gates Percival (1795-1856) was\r\nan American poet, musician, linguist, surgeon, and scientist; it is\r\npossible the reference is to Thomas Percival (1740-1804), an English\r\nphysician. Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729-1799) was an Italian\r\nnaturalist, distinguished in experimental physiology.\r\n\r\n61. 22-31. All of these titles have been traced, except the last,\r\nwhich Poe either invented, or, in quoting, altered.  Some of the works\r\nnamed he apparently had not read, since their character is not suited\r\nto his purpose. Jean Baptiste Louis Gresset (1709-1777) was a French\r\npoet and playwright; the two works mentioned are poems,--the first, a\r\ntale of an escaped parrot who stopped at a convent and shocked the\r\nnuns by his profanity. Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527) was a\r\nfamous Italian historian and statesman, who wrote a celebrated\r\ntreatise called \"The Prince\"; \"Belphegor\" is a satire on marriage.\r\nEmanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) was an eminent Swedish\r\ntheologian and religious mystic.  Ludvig Holberg (1684-1754)\r\nwas a great Danish poet and novelist; the work mentioned is one of his\r\nbest known poems and has been translated into the principal languages\r\nof Europe. Flud, Robert Fludd (1574-1637), was an English\r\nphysician, inventor, and mystic philosopher. Jean D'Indaginé\r\n(flourished in the first half of the sixteenth century) was a priest\r\nof Steinheim, Germany, who wrote on palmistry and similar subjects.\r\nMarin Cureau de la Chambre (1594-1675), physician to Louis XIV,\r\nwho was an adept in physiognomy, and wrote a work on \"The Art of\r\nJudging Men.\" Ludwig Tieck (1773-1853) was a German romantic\r\nnovelist. Tommaso Campanella (1568-1639) was an Italian monk\r\nand philosopher, who suffered persecution by the Inquisition.\r\nEymeric, Nicolas Eymericus (1320-1399), was a native of Gerona,\r\nSpain, who entered the Dominican order and rose to the rank of\r\nchaplain to the Pope and Grand Inquisitor; his famous \"Directorium\r\nInquisitorum\" is an elaborate account of the Inquisition. Pomponius\r\nMela was a Latin writer of the first century A.D., who wrote a\r\nfamous work on geography \"De Situ Orbis\" (Concerning the Plan of the\r\nEarth).\r\n\r\n61. 31. Satyrs and Ægipans: in classic mythology the satyrs and\r\nminor deities of wood and field, with the body of a man and the feet,\r\nhair, and horns of a goat; Ægipans is practically equivalent to, and\r\nis also an epithet of Pan, the satyr-like rural god.\r\n\r\n61. 33-34. curious book in quarto Gothic: printed in the\r\nblack-faced letters of mediæval times.\r\n\r\n61. 35. The Latin title, which has not been found, means \"Vigils for\r\nthe Dead according to the Choir of the Church of Mayence.\"\r\n\r\n66. 1-2. The \"Mad Trist\" of Sir Launcelot Canning has not been found;\r\nundoubtedly the title was coined and the quotations invented to fit\r\nthe text, as they do perfectly.\r\n\r\n69. 24-25. It was the work of the rushing gust. Note the fine\r\neffect of the momentary suspense, the instant's disappointment carried\r\nby this clause.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM  WILSON\r\n\r\nFirst published in a magazine in 1840 (see comment in the\r\nIntroduction, page xxvii).\r\n\r\n71. Quotation. William Chamberlayne, an English poet and\r\nphysician (1619-1689), who in 1659 published \"Pharronida, a Heroic\r\nPoem.\"\r\n\r\n71. 18. Elah-Gabalus: usually Elagabulus, emperor of Rome from\r\n218-222, who indulged in the wildest debaucheries.\r\n\r\n72. 26-73 2. The description here is based on fact, apparently\r\nbeing a true picture of the English school attended by Poe himself\r\n(see Introduction, page xii).\r\n\r\n73. 31. Draconian Laws: Draco was an Athenian legislator, who codified\r\nthe laws of his city in 621 B.C. The penalty for every offense was\r\ndeath, and the laws were, therefore, said to be written in blood, not\r\nink.\r\n\r\n75. 5. peine forte et dure: \"punishment severe and merciless\";\r\na penalty formerly imposed by Enlish law upon persons who refused to\r\nplead on being arraigned for felony. It consisted in laying the\r\naccused on his back on a bare floor and placing a great iron weight on\r\nhis chest until he consented to plead or died. There is one instance\r\nof the infliction of this punishment in American colonial history:\r\nGiles Cory, accused of witchcraft, was pressed to death in\r\nSalem, Massachusetts, in 1692.\r\n\r\n75. 33. exergues: the exergue is a term in numismatics to\r\nsignify the space under the principal figure on the reverse of a coin,\r\nusually containing the date or place of coining.\r\n\r\n76. 7. \"Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!\" \"Oh! the good\r\ntime, the age of iron.\"\r\n\r\n86. 11. Herodes Atticus: a Greek born about A.D. 101, who\r\ninherited from his father, of the same name, great wealth, to which he\r\nadded by marriage. He was a noted teacher of rhetoric and became a\r\nRoman consul.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTRÖM (Page 94)\r\n\r\nFirst published in a magazine in 1841 (see comment in the\r\nIntroduction, pages xxvii-xxviii).\r\n\r\n94. Quotation. Joseph Glanville, or Glanvill (1636-1680), an\r\nEnglish clergyman and author of several works on philosophy and\r\nreligion.  The quotation has been found in the writings of Glanvill by\r\nProfessor Woodberry, but Poe quoted rather carelessly, and his extract\r\nvaries slightly from the original. The Democritus referred to was a\r\nfamous Greek philosopher, born about 470 B.C., who taught the atomic\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n94. 1-3. Note the effect of the opening sentences in seizing attention\r\nand arousing interest at once.\r\n\r\n95. 21. Nubian geographer ... Mare Tenebrarum. The same\r\nallusion occurs in \"Eleonora,\" and in \"Eureka\" Poe speaks of \"the\r\n_Mare Tenebrarum_,--an ocean well described by the Nubian geographer,\r\nPtolemy Hephestion.\" Apparently he refers to Claudius Ptolemy, a\r\ncelebrated philosopher who flourished in Alexandria in the second\r\ncentury A.D.\r\n\r\nHis theory, known as the Ptolemaic System, remained the standard\r\nauthority in astronomy to the end of the Middle Ages, while his\r\ngeography was accepted until the era of the great discoveries opened\r\nin the fifteenth century. Ptolemy is thought to have been born in\r\nEgypt, and it is impossible to say what grounds Poe had for calling\r\nhim Nubian.  _Mare Tenebrarum_ means \"sea of darkness,\" the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n96. 10-15. This is a real description of the geography of the region\r\nof the Lofoden islands. Refer to a good map of Norway.\r\n\r\n97. 27. Maelström: from Norwegian words meaning \"grind\" and\r\n\"stream.\" The swift tidal currents and eddies of the Lofoden islands\r\nare very dangerous, but the early accounts are greatly exaggerated,\r\nand Poe's description is, aside from being based on these accounts,\r\npurely imaginative.\r\n\r\n97. 32. Jonas Ramus. Professor Woodberry, whose study of Poe's\r\ntext has been exhaustive, has an interesting note to this effect: Poe\r\nused an article in an early edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, in\r\nwhich a passage was taken from Pontoppidan's \"The Natural History of\r\nNorway\" without acknowledgment, this in turn having been taken (with\r\nproper acknowledgment) from Ramus. The Britannica, in the ninth\r\nedition, after giving Poe credit for \"erudition taken solely from a\r\nprevious edition of this very encyclopedia, which in its turn had\r\nstolen the learning from another, quotes the parts that Poe invented\r\nout of his own head.\" See \"Whirlpool\" in the Britannica.\r\n\r\n98. 26-27. Norway mile: a little over four and a half English\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n99. 19. Phlegethon: a river of Hades in which flowed flames\r\ninstead of water.\r\n\r\n100. 4. Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680) was a learned Roman Catholic\r\nwriter, a native of Germany. See \"Whirlpool\" in the Britannica.\r\n\r\n105. 2. what a scene it was to light up! Interest in the\r\nnarrative should not hurry the reader too much to appreciate this\r\nscene,--the magnificent setting of the adventure.\r\n\r\n109. 10. tottering bridge, etc.: Al Sirat, the bridge from\r\nearth over the abyss of hell to the Mohammedan paradise. It is as\r\nnarrow as a sword's edge, and while the good traverse it in safety,\r\nthe wicked plunge to torment.\r\n\r\n111. 35. Archimedes of Syracuse (i.e. 287--212) was the\r\ngreatest of ancient mathematicians; the work to which Poe refers deals\r\nwith floating bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH (Page 113)\r\n\r\nFirst published in _Graham's Magazine_ for May, 1842 (see comment in\r\nthe Introduction, page xxvii).\r\n\r\n113. The \"Red Death\" is a product of Poe's own imagination;\r\nthere is no record of such a disease in medical history.\r\n\r\n113. 3. avatar: a word from Hindoo mythology, in which it means\r\nan incarnation. The word is used here in its secondary sense,--a\r\nvisible manifestation.\r\n\r\n113. 11. This paragraph suggests the circumstances under which\r\nBoccaccio represents the stories of his famous \"Decameron.\" A\r\ncomparison will be interesting.\r\n\r\n116. 3. decora: possibly used as a plural of \"decorum,\"\r\npropriety; probably it is intended to suggest ornamentation.\r\n\r\n116. 14. Hernani: a well-known tragedy by the great French\r\nwriter, Victor Hugo (1802-1885).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOLD-BUG (Page 120)\r\n\r\nFirst published in the _Dollar Newspaper_ of Philadelphia in June,\r\n1843, as the $100 prize story (see comment in the Introduction, page\r\nxxviii).  This is the best and most widely read of the stories\r\nregarding Captain Kidd's treasure. Read an account of Captain Kidd in\r\nan encyclopedia or dictionary of biography.\r\n\r\nIs the main incident of the story the discovery of the treasure or the\r\nsolution of the cryptogram? Would the first satisfy you without the\r\nsecond? The plot is worthy of careful study. Consider the following\r\npoints, for example: the significance of the chilly day, how\r\nLieutenant G---- affects the course of events, the incident of the dog\r\nrushing in, the effect of introducing the gold-bug and making it the\r\ntitle of the story. If Poe's purpose was to make a story of\r\ncryptography, think of some of the innumerable plots he might have\r\nused, and see what you think of the effectiveness of the one chosen.\r\n\r\n120. Quotation. Arthur Murphy (1727-1805), an English actor and\r\nplaywright, wrote a comedy called \"All in the Wrong,\" but Professor\r\nW.P. Trent, who examined the play, failed to find Poe's quotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n120. 15. Poe, while serving in the army, was stationed at Fort\r\nMoultrie, and should have known the region well, but his description\r\nis said to be inaccurate.\r\n\r\n121. 11. Jan Swammerdamm (1637-1680), a Dutch naturalist, who\r\ndevoted most of his time to the study of insects.\r\n\r\n122. 7. scarabæus: Latin for \"beetle,\" and the scientific term in\r\nentomology. While there are various golden beetles, Poe's was a\r\ncreation of his own.\r\n\r\n122. 26. This is one of the early attempts to use negro dialect. Poe's\r\nefforts are rather clumsy, considering his long residence in the\r\nSouth.  The reader will notice a number of improbable expressions of\r\nJupiter's, introduced for humorous effect, but the general character\r\nof the old negro is portrayed, in the main, very well.\r\n\r\n124. 5. scarabæus caput bominis: man's-head beetle.\r\n\r\n127. 17. brusquerie: brusqueness, abruptness.\r\n\r\n127. 20. solus: Latin for \"alone.\"  The Latin word is\r\naltogether unnecessary.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S.

For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n","Paragraphs":["ns from Poe, by J.

After an engraving by Cole]\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nEdgar Allan Poe has been the subject of so much controversy that he is\nthe one American writer whom high-school pupils (not to mention\nteachers) are likely to approach with ready-made prejudices. It is\nimpossible to treat such a subject in quite the ordinary\nmatter-of-course way. Furthermore, his writings are so highly\nsubjective, and so intimately connected with his strongly held\ncritical theories, as to need somewhat careful and extended study.","These facts make it very difficult to treat either the man or his art\nas simply as is desirable in a secondary text-book.

His life, touched by the extremes of fortune, was\non the whole more unhappy than that of any other of our prominent men\nof letters. His character was strangely complex, and was the subject\nof misunderstanding during his life and of heated dispute after his\r\ndeath; his writings were long neglected or disparaged at home, while\naccepted abroad as our greatest literary achievement. Now, after more\nthan half a century has elapsed since his death, careful biographers\nhave furnished a tolerably full account of the real facts about his\nlife; a fairly accurate idea of his character is winning general\nacceptance; and the name of Edgar Allan Poe has been conceded a place\r\namong the two or three greatest in our literature.\n\n\nLIFE AND CHARACTER\n\nIn December, 1811, a well-known actress of the time died in Richmond,\nleaving destitute three little children, the eldest but four years of\nage. This mother, who was Elizabeth (Arnold) Poe, daughter of an\nEnglish actress, had suffered from ill health for several years and\nhad long found the struggle for existence difficult. Her husband,\r\nDavid Poe, probably died before her; he was a son of General David\nPoe, a Revolutionary veteran of Baltimore, and had left his home and\nlaw books for the stage several years before his marriage. The second\nof the three children, born January 19, 1809, in Boston, where his\nparents happened to be playing at the time, was Edgar Poe, the future\npoet and story-writer. The little Edgar was adopted by the wife of","Mr. John Allan, a well-to-do Scotch merchant of the city, who later\nbecame wealthy, and the boy was thereafter known as Edgar Allan\nPoe. He was a beautiful and precocious child, who at six years of age\ncould read, draw, dance, and declaim the best poetry with fine effect\nand appreciation; report says, also, that he had been taught to stand\non a chair and pledge Mr. Allan's guests in a glass of wine with\r\n\"roguish grace.\"\n\nIn 1815 Mr. Allan went to England, where he remained five years. Edgar\nwas placed in an old English school in the suburbs of London, among\nhistoric, literary, and antiquarian associations, and possibly was\ntaken to the Continent by his foster parents at vacation seasons. The\nEnglish residence and the sea voyages left deep impressions on the\nboy's sensitive nature. Returning to Richmond, he was prepared in good\r\nschools for the University of Virginia, which he entered at the age of\nseventeen, pursuing studies in ancient and modern languages and\nliteratures. During this youthful period he was already developing a\nstriking and peculiar personality. He was brilliant, if not\nindustrious, as a student, leaving the University with highest honors\nin Latin and French; he was quick and nervous in his movements and\r\ngreatly excelled in athletics, especially in swimming; in character,\nhe was reserved, solitary, sensitive, and given to lonely reverie.\nSome of his aristocratic playmates remembered to his discredit that he\nwas the child of strolling players, and their attitude helped to add a\nstrain of defiance to an already intensely proud nature. Though kindly\ntreated by his foster parents, this strange boy longed for an\r\nunderstanding sympathy that was not his. Once he thought he had found\nit in Mrs. Jane Stannard, mother of a schoolmate; but the new friend\nsoon died, and for months the grief-stricken boy, it is said, haunted\nthe lonely grave at night and brooded over his loss and the mystery of\ndeath--a not very wholesome experience for a lonely and melancholy lad\nof fifteen years.\n\nAt the University he drank wine, though not intemperately, and played","cards a great deal, the end of the term finding him with gambling\ndebts of twenty-five hundred dollars. These habits were common at the\ntime, and Edgar did not incur any censure from the faculty; but\nMr. Allan declined to honor the gambling debt, removed Edgar, and\nplaced him in his own counting room. Such a life was too dull for the\nhigh-spirited, poetic youth, and he promptly left his home.\n\nGoing to Boston, he published a thin volume of boyish verse,\n\"Tamerlane, and Other Poems,\" but realizing nothing financially,[1] he\nenlisted in the United States Army as Edgar A. Perry. After two years\nof faithful and efficient service, he procured through Mr. Allan (who\nwas temporarily reconciled to him) an appointment to the West Point\nMilitary Academy, entering in July, 1830. In the meantime, he had\r\npublished in Baltimore a second small volume of poems. Fellow-students\nhave described him as having a \"worn, weary, discontented look\";\nusually kindly and courteous, but shy, reserved, and exceedingly\nsensitive; an extraordinary reader, but noted for carping criticism.\nAlthough a good student, he seemed galled beyond endurance by the\nmonotonous routine of military duties, which he deliberately neglected\nand thus procured his dismissal from the Academy. He left, alone and\npenniless, in March, 1831.\n\n[Footnote 1: In November, 1900, a single copy of this little volume\nsold in New York for $2550.]\n\nGoing to New York, Poe brought out another little volume of poems\nshowing great improvement; then he went to Baltimore, and after a\nprecarious struggle of a year or two, turned to prose, and, while in\r\ngreat poverty, won a prize of one hundred dollars from the Baltimore\n_Saturday Visitor_ for his story, \"The Manuscript Found in a\nBottle.\" Through John P. Kennedy[1], one of the judges whose\nfriendship the poverty-stricken author gained, he procured a good deal\nof hack work, and finally an editorial position on the _Southern\nLiterary Messenger_, of Richmond. The salary was fair, and better","was in sight; yet Poe was melancholy, dissatisfied, and miserable. He\nwrote a pitiable letter to Mr. Kennedy, asking to be convinced \"that\nit is at all necessary to live.\"\n\n[Footnote 1: A well-known Marylander, author of \"Horse-Shoe Robinson,\"\n\"Swallow Barn,\" \"Rob of the Bowl,\" and other popular novels of the\nday, and later Secretary of the Navy.]\n\nFor several years he had been making his home with an aunt, Mrs.\r\nClemm, and her daughter, Virginia, a girl beautiful in character and\nperson, but penniless and probably already a victim of the consumption\nthat was eventually to cause her death. In 1836, when she was only\nfourteen years old, Poe married his cousin, to whom he was\npassionately attached. His devotion to her lasted through life, and\nthe tenderest affection existed between him and Mrs. Clemm, who was\nall a mother could have been to him; so that the home life was always\nbeautiful in spirit, however poor in material comfort.\n\nIn January, 1837, his connection with the _Messenger_ was\nsevered, probably because of his occasional lapses from sobriety; but\nhis unfortunate temperament and his restless ambition were doubtless\nfactors. With some reputation as poet, story-writer, critic, and\r\neditor, Poe removed to New York, and a year later to Philadelphia,\nwhere he remained until 1844.  Here he found miscellaneous literary,\neditorial, and hack work, finally becoming editor of _Graham's\nMagazine_, which prospered greatly under his management, increasing\nits circulation from eight thousand to forty thousand within a\nyear. But Poe's restless spirit was dissatisfied. He was intensely\nanxious to own a magazine for himself, and had already made several\nunsuccessful efforts to obtain one,--efforts which were to be repeated\nat intervals, and with as little success, until the day his death. He\nvainly sought a government position, that a livelihood might be\nassured while he carried out his literary plans. Finally he left\n_Graham's_, doubtless because of personal peculiarities, since","his occasional inebriety did not interfere with his work; and there\nfollowed a period of wretched poverty, broken once by the winning of a\nprize of one hundred dollars for \"The Gold Bug.\"\n\nHe continued to be known as a \"reserved, isolated, dreamy man, of\nhigh-strung nerves, proud spirit, and fantastic moods,\" with a\nhaunting sense of impending evil.  His home was poor and simple, but\nimpressed every visitor by its neatness and quiet refinement;\r\nVirginia, accomplished in music and languages, was as devoted to her\nhusband as he was to her. Both were fond of flowers and plants, and of\nhousehold pets. Mrs.  Clemm gave herself completely to her \"children\"\nand was the business manager of the family.\n\nIn the spring of 1844 Poe went with Virginia to New York, practically\npenniless, and to Mrs. Clemm, who did not come at once, he wrote with\r\npathetic enthusiasm of the generous meals served at their boarding\nhouse. He obtained a position on the _Evening Mirror_ at small\npay, but did his dull work faithfully and efficiently; later, he\nbecame editor of the _Broadway Journal_, in which he printed\nrevisions of his best tales and poems. In 1845 appeared \"The Raven,\"\nwhich created a profound sensation at home and abroad, and immediately\nwon, and has since retained, an immense popularity. He was at the\nheight of his fame, but poor, as always. In 1846 he published \"The\nLiterati,\" critical comments on the writers of the day, in which the\nliterary small fry were mercilessly condemned and ridiculed. This\nnaturally made Poe a host of enemies. One of these, Thomas Dunn\nEnglish, published an abusive article attacking the author's","character, whereupon Poe sued him for libel and obtained two hundred\nand twenty-five dollars damages.\n\nThe family now moved to a little three-room cottage at Fordham, a\nquiet country place with flowers and trees and pleasant vistas; but\nillness and poverty were soon there, too.  In 1841 Virginia had burst\na blood vessel while singing, and her life was despaired of; this had\nhappened again and again, leaving her weaker each time. As the summer\nand fall of this year wore away, she grew worse and needed the\ntenderest care and attention. But winter drew on, and with it came\ncold and hunger; the sick girl lay in an unheated room on a straw bed,\nwrapped in her husband's coat, the husband and mother trying to chafe\na little warmth into her hands and feet. Some kind-hearted women\r\nrelieved the distress in a measure, but on January 30, 1847, Virginia\ndied. The effect on Poe was terrible. It is easy to see how a very\nartist of death, who could study the dreadful stages of its slow\napproach and seek to penetrate the mystery of its ultimate nature with\nsuch intense interest and deep reflection as did Poe, must have\nbrooded and suffered during the years of his wife's illness.  His own\r\nhealth had long been poor; his brain was diseased and insanity seemed\nimminent. After intense grief came a period of settled gloom and\nhaunting fear. The less than three years of life left for him was a\nperiod of decline in every respect. But he remained in the little\ncottage, finding some comfort in caring for his flowers and pets, and\ntaking long solitary rambles. During this time he thought out and\r\nwrote \"Eureka,\" a treatise on the structure, laws, and destiny of the\nuniverse, which he desired to have regarded as a poem.\n\nPoe had always felt a need for the companionship of sympathetic and\naffectionate women, for whom he entertained a chivalric regard\namounting to reverence. After the shock of his wife's death had\nsomewhat worn away, he began to depend for sympathy upon various women\nwith whom he maintained romantic friendships. Judged by ordinary\nstandards, his conduct became at times little short of maudlin; his\ncorrespondence showed a sort of gasping, frantic dependence upon the\nsympathy and consolation of these women friends, and exhibited a\npainful picture of a broken man. Mrs. Shew, one of the kind women who\nhad relieved the family at the time of Virginia's last illness,","strongly advised him to marry, and he did propose marriage to\nMrs. Sara Helen Whitman, a verse writer of some note in her day. After\na wild and exhausting wooing, begun in an extravagantly romantic\nmanner, the match was broken off through the influence of the lady's\nfriends. When it was all over Poe seemed very little disturbed. The\ntruth is, he was a wreck, and feeling utterly dependent, clutched\r\nfrantically at every hope of sympathy and consolation. His only real\nlove was for his dead wife, which he recorded shortly before his death\nin the exquisite lyric, \"Annabel Lee.\"\n\nIn July, 1849, full of the darkest forebodings, and predicting that he\nshould never return, Poe went to Richmond. Here he spent a few quiet\nmonths, part of the time fairly cheerful, but twice yielding to the\ntemptation to drink, and each time suffering, in consequence, a\r\ndangerous illness. On September 30 he left Richmond for New York with\nfifteen hundred dollars, the product of a recent lecture arranged by\nkind Richmond friends. What happened during the next three days is an\nimpenetrable mystery, but on October 3 (Wednesday) he was found in an\nelection booth in Baltimore, desperately ill, his money and baggage\ngone. The most probable story is that he had been drugged by political\r\nworkers, imprisoned in a \"coop\" with similar victims, and used as a\nrepeater [1], this procedure being a common one at the time. Whether\nhe was also intoxicated is a matter of doubt. There could be but one\neffect on his delicate and already diseased brain. He was taken to a\nhospital unconscious, lingered several days in the delirium of a\nviolent brain fever, and in the early dawn of Sunday, October 7,\r\nbreathed his last.\n\n[Footnote 1: Repeater, a person who illegally votes more than once]\n\nThe dead author's character immediately became the subject of violent\ncontroversy. His severe critical strictures had made him many enemies\namong the minor writers of the day and their friends. One of the men\nwho had suffered from Poe's too caustic pen was Rufus W. Griswold, but\nfriendly relations had been nominally established and Poe had","authorized Griswold to edit his works. This Griswold did, including a\nbiography which Poe's friends declared a masterpiece of malicious\ndistortion and misrepresentation; it certainly was grossly unfair and\ninaccurate. Poe's friends retorted, and a long war of words followed,\nin which hatred or prejudice on the one side and wholesale,\nundiscriminating laudation on the other, alike tended to obscure the\r\ntruth. It is now almost impossible to see the real Poe, just as he\nappeared to an ordinary, unprejudiced observer of his own time. Only\nby the most careful, thoughtful, and sympathetic study can we hope to\napproximate such an acquaintance.\n\nThe fundamental fact about Poe is a very peculiar and unhappy\ntemperament, certain characteristic qualities of which began to\ndisclose themselves in early boyhood and, fostered by the vicissitudes\r\nof his career, developed throughout his life.\n\nIn youth he was nervous, sensitive, morbid, proud, solitary, and\nwayward; and as the years went by, bringing poverty, illness, and the\nbitterness of failure, often through his own faults, the man became\nirritable, impatient, often morose. He had always suffered from fits\nof depression,--\"blue devils,\" Mr.  Kennedy called them,--and though\r\nhe was extravagantly sanguine at times, melancholy was his usual mood,\noften manifesting itself in a haunting fear of evil to come. The\npeculiar character of his wonderful imagination made actual life less\nreal to him than his own land of dreams: the \"distant Aidenn,\" the\n\"dim lake of Auber,\" the \"kingdom by the sea,\" seemed more genuine\nthan the landscapes of earth; the lurid \"city in the sea\" more\nsubstantial than the streets he daily walked.\n\nBecause of this intensely subjective and self-absorbed character of\nmind, he had no understanding of human nature, no insight into\ncharacter with its marvelous complexities and contradictions. With\nthese limitations Poe, as might be expected, had a very defective\nsense of humor, lacked true sympathy, was tactless, possessed little","business ability, and was excessively annoyed by the dull routine and\nrude frictions of ordinary life. He was always touched by kindness,\nbut was quick to resent an injury, and even as a boy could not endure\na jest at his expense. He had many warm and devoted friends whom he\nloved in return, but the limitations of his own nature probably made a\nreally frank, unreserved friendship impossible; and when a break\r\noccurred, he was apt to assume that his former friend was an utter\nvillain. These personal characteristics, in conjunction with a goading\nambition which took form in the idea of an independent journal of his\nown in which he might find untrammeled expression, added uneasiness\nand restlessness to a constantly discontented nature. To some extent,\nat least, Poe realized the curse of such a temperament, but he strove\r\nvainly against its impulses.\n\nThe one genuine human happiness of this sad life was found in a\nsingularly beautiful home atmosphere. Husband and wife were\npassionately devoted to each other, and Mrs. Clemm was more than a\nmother to both. She says of her son-in-law: \"At home, he was simple\nand affectionate as a child, and during all the years he lived with\nme, I do not remember a single night that he failed to come and kiss\r\nhis 'mother,' as he called me, before going to bed.\" This faithful\nwoman remained devoted to him after Virginia's death, and to his\nmemory, when calumny assailed it, after his own.\n\nThe capital charge against Poe's character has been intemperance, and\nalthough the matter has been grossly exaggerated and misrepresented,\nthe charge is true. Except for short periods, he was never what is\r\nknown as dissipated, and he struggled desperately against his\nweakness,--an unequal struggle, since the craving was inherited, and\nfostered by environment, circumstances, and temperament. One of his\nbiographers tells of bread soaked in gin being fed to the little Poe\nchildren by an old nurse during the illness of their mother; and there\nis another story, already mentioned, of the little Edgar, in his","adoptive home, taught to pledge the guests as a social grace.\nDrinking was common at the time, wine was offered in every home and at\nevery social function, and in the South, where Poe spent his youth and\nearly manhood, the spirit of hospitality and conviviality held out\nconstant temptation. To his delicate organization strong drink early\nbecame a veritable poison, and indulgence that would have been a small\r\nmatter to another man was ruinous to him; indeed, a single glass of\nwine drove him practically insane, and a debauch was sure to\nfollow. Indulgence was stimulated, also, by the nervous strain and\nworry induced by uncertain livelihood and privation, the frequent fits\nof depression, and by constant brooding. Sometimes he fought his\nweakness successfully for several years, but always it conquered in\nthe end.\r\nMoreover, he speaks of a very special cause in the latter part of his\nlife, which in fairness should be heard in his own written words to a\nfriend: \"Six years ago a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved\nbefore, ruptured a blood vessel in singing. Her life was despaired\nof. I took leave of her forever and underwent all the agonies of her\ndeath. She recovered partially and I again hoped. At the end of a year\r\nthe vessel broke again. I went through precisely the same scene....\nThen again--again--and even once again, at varying intervals. Each\ntime I felt all the agonies of her death--and at each accession of her\ndisorder I loved her more dearly and clung to her life with more\ndesperate pertinacity. But I am constitutionally sensitive--nervous in\na very unusual degree.  I became insane, with long intervals of\r\nhorrible sanity. During these fits of absolute unconsciousness, I\ndrank--God only knows how often or how much. As a matter of course, my\nenemies referred the insanity to the drink, rather than the drink to\nthe insanity.... It was the horrible never-ending oscillation between\nhope and despair, which I could _not_ longer have endured without\ntotal loss of reason. In the death of what was my life, then, I","received a new, but--O God!--how melancholy an existence!\"\n\nThis statement, and the other facts mentioned, are not offered as\nwholly excusing Poe. Doubtless a stronger man would have resisted,\ndoubtless a less self-absorbed man would have thought of his wife's\nhappiness as well as of his own relief from torture. Yet the\nfair-minded person, familiar with Poe's unhappy life, and keeping in\r\nmind the influences of heredity, temperament, and environment, will\nhesitate to pronounce a severe judgment.\n\nPoe was also accused of untruthfulness, and this accusation likewise\nhas a basis of fact. He repeatedly furnished or approved statements\nregarding his life and work that were incorrect, he often made a\ndisingenuous show of pretended learning, and he sometimes misstated\nfacts to avoid wounding his own vanity. This ugly fault seems to have\r\nresulted from a fondness for romantic posing, and is doubtless related\nto the peculiar character of imagination already mentioned. Perhaps,\ntoo, he inherited from his actor parents a love of applause, and if\nso, the trait was certainly encouraged in early childhood.  There is\nno evidence that he was ever guilty of malicious or mercenary\nfalsehood.\n\nAnother of his bad habits was borrowing, but it must be remembered\r\nthat his life was one long struggle with grinding poverty, that he and\nthose dear to him sometimes suffered actual hunger and cold. Many who\nknew him testified to his anxiety to pay all his debts, Mr. Graham\nreferring to him in this particular as \"the soul of honor.\"\n\nIn a letter to Lowell, Poe has well described himself in a sentence:\n\"My life has been whim--impulse--passion--a longing for solitude--a","scorn of all things present in an earnest desire for the future.\"\nInterpreted, this means that in a sense he never really reached\nmaturity, that he remained a slave to his impulses and emotions, that\nhe detested the ordinary business of life and could not adapt himself\nto it, that his mind was full of dreams of ideal beauty and\nperfection, that his whole soul yearned to attain the highest\npleasures of artistic creation. His was perpetually a deeply agitated\nsoul; as such, it was natural he should outwardly seem irritable,\nimpatient, restless, discontented, and solitary. It is impossible to\nbelieve that there was any strain of real evil in Poe. A man who could\ninspire such devotion as he had from such a woman as Mrs. Clemm, a man\nwho loved flowers and children and animal pets, who could be so\r\ndevoted a husband, who could so consecrate himself to art, was not a\nbad man. Yet his acts were often, as we have seen, most\nreprehensible. Frequently the subject of slander, he was not a victim\nof conspiracy to defame. Although circumstances were many times\nagainst him, he was his own worst enemy. He was cursed with a\ntemperament. His mind was analytical and imaginative, and gave no\r\nthought to the ethical. He remained wayward as a child. The man, like\nhis art, was not immoral, but simply unmoral. Whatever his faults, he\nsuffered frightfully for them, and his fame suffered after him.\n\n\nLITERARY WORK\n\nPoe's first literary ventures were in verse. The early volumes,\nshowing strongly the influence of Byron and Moore, were productions of\nsmall merit but large promise. Their author was soon to become one of\r\nthe most original of poets, his later work being unique, with a\nstrangely individual, \"Poe\" atmosphere that no other writer has ever\nbeen able successfully to imitate. His verse is individual in theme,\ntreatment, and structure, all of which harmonize with his conscious\ntheory of poetic art. His theory is briefly this: It is not the\nfunction of poetry to teach either truth or morals, but to gratify","through novel forms \"the thirst for supernal beauty\"; its proper\neffect is to \"excite, by elevating, the soul.\" The highest beauty has\nalways some admixture of sadness, the most poetical of all themes\nbeing the death of a beautiful woman. Moreover, the pleasure derived\nfrom the contemplation of this higher beauty should be indefinite;\nthat is, true poetic feeling is not the result of coherent narrative\r\nor clear pictures or fine moral sentiment, but consists in vague,\nexalted emotion. Music, of all the arts, produces the vaguest and most\n\"indefinite\" pleasure; consequently verse forms should be chosen with\nthe greatest possible attention to musical effect. Poetry must be\npurely a matter of feeling. \"Its sole arbiter is Taste. With the\nIntellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral relations.\"\r\nThis explanation is necessary, because the stock criticism of Poe's\npoetry condemns it as vague, indefinite, and devoid of thought or\nethical content. These are precisely its limitations, but hardly its\nfaults, since the poet attained with marvelous art the very effects he\ndesired. The themes of nearly all the poems are death, ruin, regret,\nor failure; the verse is original in form, and among the most musical\r\nin the language, full of a haunting, almost magical melody. Mystery,\nsymbolism, shadowy suggestion, fugitive thought, elusive beauty,\nbeings that are mere insubstantial abstractions--these are the\ncharacteristics, but designedly so, of Poe's poetry. A poem to him was\nsimply a crystallized mood, and it is futile for his readers to apply\nany other test. Yet the influence of this verse has been wide and\r\nimportant, extending to most lyric poets of the last half-century,\nincluding such masters as Rossetti and Swinburne.\n\n\"To Helen,\" a poem of three brief stanzas, is Poe's first really\nnotable production; it is an exquisite tribute of his reverent\ndevotion to his boyhood friend, Mrs. Stannard, portraying her as a\nclassic embodiment of beauty. \"Israfel\" is a lyric of aspiration of\nrare power and rapture, worthy of Shelley, and is withal the most","spontaneous, simple, and genuinely human poem Poe ever wrote. \"The\nHaunted Palace,\" one of the finest of his poems, is an unequaled\nallegory of the wreck and ruin of sovereign reason, which to be fully\nappreciated should be read in its somber setting, \"The Fall of the\nHouse of Usher.\" Less attractive is \"The Conqueror Worm,\" with its\nrepulsive imagery, but this \"tragedy 'Man,'\" with the universe as a\r\ntheater, moving to the \"music of the spheres,\" and \"horror the soul of\nthe plot,\" is undeniably powerful and intensely terrible.\n\n\"The Raven,\" published in 1845, attained immediately a world-wide\ncelebrity, and rivals in fame and popularity any lyric ever written.\nIt is the most elaborate treatment of Poe's favorite theme, the death\nof a beautiful woman. The reveries of a bereaved lover, alone in his\r\nlibrary at midnight in \"the bleak December,\" vainly seeking to forget\nhis sorrow for the \"lost Lenore,\" are interrupted by a tapping, as of\nsome one desirous to enter. After a time, he admits a \"stately raven\"\nand seeks to beguile his sad fancy by putting questions to the bird,\nwhose one reply is \"Nevermore,\" and this constitutes the refrain of\nthe poem. Impelled by an instinct of self-torture, the lover asks\r\nwhether he shall have \"respite\" from the painful memories of \"Lenore,\"\nhere or hereafter, and finally whether in the \"distant Aidenn\" he and\nhis love shall be reunited; to all of which the raven returns his one\nanswer. Driven to frenzy, the lover implores the bird, \"Take thy beak\nfrom out my heart, and take thy form from off my door,\" only to learn\nthat the shadow will be lifted \"nevermore.\" The raven is, in the\r\npoet's own words, \"emblematical of Mournful and Never-Ending\nRemembrance.\"\n\n\"Ulalume\" has been commonly (though not always) regarded as a mere\nexperiment in verbal ingenuity, meaningless melody, or \"the insanity\nof versification,\" as a distinguished American critic has called\nit. Such a judgment is a mark of inability to understand Poe's most\ncharacteristic work, for in truth \"Ulalume\" is the extreme expression","at once of his critical theory and of his peculiar genius as a\npoet. It was published in December of the same year in which Virginia\ndied in January. The poet's condition has already been described;\n\"Ulalume\" is a marvelous expression of his mood at this time.  It\ndepicts a soul worn out by long suffering, groping for courage and\nhope, only to return again to \"the door of a legended tomb.\" It is\r\ntrue the movement is slow, impeded by the frequent repetitions, but so\nthe wearied mind, after nervous exhaustion, is \"palsied and sere.\"\nThere is no appeal to the intellect, but this is characteristic of Poe\nand appropriate to a mind numbed by protracted suffering. It is this\nmood of wearied, benumbed, discouraged, hopeless hope, feebly seeking\nfor the \"Lethean peace of the skies\" only to find the mind inevitably\r\nreverting to the \"lost Ulalume,\" that finds expression. There is no\ndefinite thought, because only the communication of feeling is\nintended; there is no distinct setting, because the whole action is\nspiritual; \"the dim lake\" and \"dark tarn of Auber,\" \"the ghoul-haunted\nwoodland of Weir,\" \"the alley Titanic of cypress,\" are the\ngrief-stricken and fear-haunted places of the poet's own darkened\r\nmind, while the ashen skies of \"the lonesome October\" are significant\nenough of this \"most immemorial year.\" The poem is a monody of\nnerveless, exhausted grief. As such it must be read to be appreciated,\nas such it must be judged, and so appreciated and so judged it is\nabsolutely unique and incomparable.\n\nAbout a year later came \"The Bells,\" wonderful for the music of its\r\nverse, and the finest onomatopoetic poem in the language. Two days\nafter Poe's death appeared \"Annabel Lee,\" a simple, sincere, and\nbeautiful ballad, a tribute to his dead wife. Last of all was printed\nthe brief \"Eldorado,\" a fitting death-song for Poe, in which a gallant\nknight sets out, \"singing a song,\" \"in search of Eldorado,\" only to\nlearn when youth and strength are gone that he must seek his goal\n\"down the Valley of the Shadow.\"","The tales, like the poems, are a real contribution to the world's\nliterature, but more strikingly so, since the type itself is\noriginal. Poe, Hawthorne, and Irving are distinctly the pioneers in\nthe production of the modern short story, and neither has been\nsurpassed on his own ground; but Poe has been vastly the greater\ninfluence in foreign countries, especially in France. Poe formed a new\r\nconception of the short story, one which Professor Brander Matthews[1]\nhas treated formally and explicitly as a distinct literary form,\ndifferent from the story that is merely short. Without calling it a\ndistinct form, Poe implied the idea in a review of Hawthorne's\n\"Twice-Told Tales\":\n\n[Footnote 1: \"The Philosophy of the Short-Story,\" Chapter IV of \"Pen\nand Ink.\"]\n\nThe ordinary novel is objectionable from its length.... As it cannot\r\nbe read at one sitting, it deprives itself, of course, of the immense\nforce derivable from _totality_.... In the brief tale, however,\nthe author is enabled to carry out the fulness of his intention, be it\nwhat it may. During the hour of perusal, the soul of the reader is at\nthe writer's control....\n\nA skillful literary artist has constructed a tale. If wise, he has not\nfashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents; but having\r\nconceived with deliberate care a certain unique or single\n_effect_ to be wrought out, he then invents such incidents--he\nthen combines such events as may best aid him in establishing this\npreconceived effect. If his very initial sentence tend not to the\nout-bringing of this effect, then he has failed in his first step. In\nthe whole composition there should be no word written, of which the","tendency, direct or indirect, is not to the one preëstablished design.\n\nThis idea of a short story should be kept in mind in reading Poe's\nworks, for he applied his theory perfectly.\n\nThe stories are of greater variety than the poems. There are romances\nof death whose themes are fear, horror, madness, catalepsy, premature\nburial, torture, mesmerism, and revengeful cruelty; tales of weird\nbeauty; allegories of conscience; narratives of pseudo-science;\nstories of analytical reasoning; descriptions of beautiful landscapes;\nand what are usually termed \"prose poems.\" He also wrote tales\ngrotesque, humorous, and satirical, most of which are failures. The\nearlier tales are predominantly imaginative and emotional; most of the\nlater ones are predominantly intellectual. None of the tales touches\r\nordinary, healthy life; there is scarcely a suggestion of local color;\nthe humor is nearly always mechanical; there is little conversation\nand the characters are never normal human beings. Although the stories\nare strongly romantic in subject, plot, and setting, there is an\nextraordinary realism in treatment, a minuteness and accuracy of\ndetail equaling the work of Defoe.  This is one secret of the magical\r\nart that not only transports us to the world of dream and vision where\nthe author's own soul roamed, but for the time makes it all real to\nus.\n\nPoe's finest tale, as a work of art, is \"The Fall of the House of\nUsher,\" which is as nearly perfect in its craftsmanship as human work\nmay be. It is a romance of death with a setting of profound gloom, and\nis wrought out as a highly imaginative study in fear--a symphony in\r\nwhich every touch blends into a perfect unity of effect. \"Ligeia,\"\nperhaps standing next, incorporating \"The Conqueror Worm\" as its\nkeynote, portrays the terrific struggle of a woman's will against\ndeath.  \"The Masque of the Red Death,\" a tale of the Spirit of\nPestilence and of Death victorious over human selfishness and power,\nis a splendid study in somber color. \"The Assignation,\" a romance of","Venice, is also splendid in coloring and rich in decorative effects,\npresenting a luxury of sorrow culminating in romantic suicide.\n\"William Wilson\" is an allegory of conscience personified in a double,\nthe forerunner of Stevenson's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\" Other\nconscience stories are \"The Man of the Crowd\"; \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\"\nalso depicting insanity; and \"The Black Cat,\" of which the atmosphere\r\nis horror. \"The Adventures of One Hans Pfaal\" and \"The Balloon Hoax\"\nare examples of the pseudo-scientific tales, which attain their\nverisimilitude by diverting attention from the improbability or\nimpossibility of the general incidents to the accuracy and naturalness\nof details. In \"The Descent into the Maëlstrom,\" scientific reasoning\nis skillfully blended with imaginative strength, poetic description,\r\nand stirring adventure. This type of story is clearly enough the\noriginal of those of Jules Verne and similar writers. \"The Murders in\nthe Rue Morgue\" and \"The Purloined Letter\" are the pioneer detective\nstories, Dupin the original Sherlock Holmes, and they remain the best\nof their kind, unsurpassed in originality, ingenuity, and\nplausibility. Another type of the story of analytical reasoning is\r\n\"The Gold-Bug,\" built around the solution of a cryptogram, but also\nintroducing an element of adventure. Poe's analytical power was real,\nnot a trick. If he made Legrand solve the cryptogram and boast his\nability to solve others more difficult, Poe himself solved scores sent\nhim in response to a public magazine challenge; if Dupin solved\nmysteries that Poe invented for him, Poe himself wrote in \"Marie\nRoget,\" from newspaper accounts, the solution of a real murder\nmystery, and astounded Dickens by outlining the entire plot of\n\"Barnaby Rudge\" when only a few of the first chapters had been\npublished; if he wrote imaginatively of science, he in fact\ndemonstrated in \"Maelzel's Chess Player\" that a pretended automaton\nwas operated by a man. \"Hop Frog\" and \"The Cask of Amontillado\" are","old-world stories of revenge. \"The Island of the Fay\" and \"The Domain\nof Arnheim\" are landscape studies, the one of calm loveliness, the\nother of Oriental profusion and coloring. \"Shadow\" and \"Silence\" are\ncommonly classed as \"prose poems,\" the former being one of Poe's most\neffective productions. \"Eleonora,\" besides having a story to tell, is\nboth a prose poem and a landscape study, and withal one of Poe's most\nexquisite writings.\n\nAlthough Poe was not a great critic, his critical work is by no means\nvalueless. He applied for the first time in America a thoroughgoing\nscrutiny and able, fearless criticism to contemporary literature,\nundoubtedly with good effect. His attacks on didacticism were\nespecially valuable. His strength as a critic lay in his artistic\r\ntemperament and in the incisive intellect that enabled him to analyze\nthe effects produced in his own creations and in those of others. His\nweaknesses were extravagance; a mania for harping on plagiarism; lack\nof spiritual insight, broad sympathies, and profound scholarship; and,\nin general, the narrow range of his genius, which has already been\nmade sufficiently clear. His severity has been exaggerated, as he\r\noften praised highly, probably erring more frequently by undue\nlaudation than by extreme severity. Though personal prejudice\nsometimes crept into his work, especially in favor of women, yet on\nthe whole he was as fair and fearless as he claimed to be. Much of the\nhasty, journalistic hack work is valueless, as might be expected, but\nhe wrote very suggestively of his art, and nearly all his judgments\r\nhave been sustained. Moreover, he met one supreme test of a critic in\nrecognizing unknown genius: Dickens he was among the first to appraise\nas a great novelist; Tennyson and Elizabeth Barrett (Browning) he\nranked among the great poets without hesitation; and at home he early\nexpressed a due appreciation of Hawthorne, Lowell, Longfellow, and\nBryant.\n\nPoe's place, both in prose and poetry, is assured. His recognition","abroad has been clear and emphatic from the first, especially in\nFrance, and to-day foreigners generally regard him as the greatest\nwriter we have produced, an opinion in which a number of our own\ncritics and readers concur. One's judgment in the matter will depend\nupon the point of view and the standards adopted; it is too large a\nsubject to consider here, but if artistic craftsmanship be the\r\nstandard, certainly Hawthorne would be his only rival, and Hawthorne\nwas not also a poet.  The question of exact relative rank, however, it\nis neither possible nor important to settle. It is sufficient to say,\nin the words of Professor Woodberry, \"On the roll of our literature\nPoe's name is inscribed among the few foremost, and in the world at\nlarge his genius is established as valid among all men.\"\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nThe year after Poe's death there appeared \"The Works of the Late Edgar\nAllan Poe,\" with a Memoir, in two volumes, edited by R. W. Griswold\nand published by J. S. Redfield, New York. The same editor and\npublisher brought out a four-volume edition in 1856. Griswold had\nsuffered from Poe's sharp criticisms and had quarreled with him,\nthough later there was a reconciliation, and Poe himself selected\r\nGriswold to edit his works. The biographer painted the dead author\nvery black indeed, and his account is now generally considered unfair.\n\nIn 1874-1875 \"The Works of Edgar Allan Poe,\" with Memoir, edited by\nJohn H. Ingram, were published in four volumes, in Edinburgh, and in\n1876 in New York. Ingram represents the other extreme from Griswold,\nattempting to defend practically everything that Poe was and did.\r\nIn 1884 A. C. Armstrong & Son, New York, brought out \"The Works of\nEdgar Allan Poe\" in six volumes, with an Introduction and Memoir by\nRichard Henry Stoddard. Stoddard is far from doing justice to Poe\neither as man or as author.\n\nAlthough Griswold's editing was poor, subsequent editions followed his\nuntil 1895, when Professor George E. Woodberry and Mr. Edmund Clarence\nStedman published a new edition in ten volumes through Stone &","Kimball, Chicago (now published by Duffield & Company, New York). This\nedition is incomparably superior to all its predecessors, going to the\noriginal sources, and establishing an authentic text, corrected\nslightly in quotations and punctuation. Professor Woodberry\ncontributed a Memoir, and Mr. Stedman admirable critical articles on\nthe poems and the tales. Scholarly notes, an extensive bibliography, a\r\nnumber of portraits, and variorum readings of the poems, are included.\n\nIn 1902 T.Y. Crowell & Company, New York, issued \"The Complete Works\nof Edgar Allan Poe\" in seventeen volumes, edited by Professor James\nA. Harrison, including a biography and a volume of letters. This\nedition contains much of Poe's criticism not published in previous\neditions, and follows Poe's latest text exactly; complete variorum\r\nreadings are included.\n\nIn 1902 there also appeared \"The Booklover's Arnheim\" edition in ten\nvolumes, edited by Professor Charles F. Richardson and published by\nG.P. Putnam's Sons, New York. This is mechanically the finest edition\nof Poe's works.\n\nThe one-volume collections of poems and of tales are almost\ninnumerable, but nearly all are devoid of merit and poorly edited in\nselection, text, and notes. (This does not refer to the small\ncollections for study in schools.) The best are the following: \"Tales\nof Mystery,\" Unit Book Publishing Company, New York (72 cents); \"The\nBest Tales of Edgar Allan Poe,\" edited with critical studies by\nSherwin Cody, A.C. McClurg & Company, Chicago ($1.00); \"The Best Poems\nand Essays of E. A. Poe,\" edited with biographical and critical\r\nintroduction by Sherwin Cody, McClurg ($1.00); \"Poems of E. A. Poe,\"\ncomplete, edited and annotated by Charles W. Kent, The Macmillan\nCompany, New York (25 cents).\n\nProfessor George E. Woodberry contributed in 1885 a volume on Poe to\nthe American Men of Letters Series (Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Boston),\nwhich is the ablest yet written. In scholarship and critical\nappreciation it is all that could be desired, but unfortunately it is","unsympathetic. Mr.  Woodberry assumed a coldly judicial attitude, in\nwhich mood he is occasionally a little less than just to Poe's\ncharacter.  Professor Harrison's biography, written for the Virginia\nedition, is published separately by T.Y. Crowell & Company. It is very\nfull, and valuable for the mass of material supplied, but is not\ndiscriminating in criticism or estimate of Poe's character.\r\nNumerous magazine articles may be found by consulting the periodical\nindexes. A number of suggestive short studies are to be found in the\ntext-books of American literature, such as those of Messrs. Trent,\nAbernethy, Newcomer, and Wendell; and in the larger books of\nProfessors Richardson, Trent, and Wendell. One may also find acute and\nvaluable comment in such works as Professor Bliss Perry's \"A Study of\nProse Fiction,\" and Professor Brander Matthews's \"Philosophy of the\nShort-Story\" (published separately, and in \"Pen and Ink\").\n\nMany of Poe's tales and poems have been translated into practically\nall the important languages of modern Europe, including Greek. An\nimportant French study of Poe, recently published, is mentioned in the\nPreface.\n\n\n\n\nPOEMS\n\n\n\nSONG\n\n\nI saw thee on thy bridal day,\r\nWhen a burning blush came o'er thee,\nThough happiness around thee lay,\n  The world all love before thee;\n\nAnd in thine eye a kindling light                           5\n  (Whatever it might be)\nWas all on Earth my aching sight\n  Of loveliness could see.\n\nThat blush, perhaps, was maiden shame:\n  As such it well may pass,                                10\nThough its glow hath raised a fiercer flame\n  In the breast of him, alas!\r\nWho saw thee on that bridal day,\n  When that deep blush _would_ come o'er thee,\nThough happiness around thee lay,                          15\n  The world all love before thee.\n\n\n\nSPIRITS OF THE DEAD\n\n\nThy soul shall find itself alone\n'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone;\nNot one, of all the crowd, to pry\nInto thine hour of secrecy.\n\nBe silent in that solitude,                                 5","Which is not loneliness--for then\nThe spirits of the dead, who stood\n  In life before thee, are again\nIn death around thee, and their will\nShall overshadow thee; be still.                           10\n\nThe night, though clear, shall frown,\nAnd the stars shall look not down\nFrom their high thrones in the Heaven\nWith light like hope to mortals given,\nBut their red orbs, without beam,                          15\r\nTo thy weariness shall seem\nAs a burning and a fever\nWhich would cling to thee forever.\n\nNow are thoughts thou shalt not banish,\nNow are visions ne'er to vanish;                           20\nFrom thy spirit shall they pass\nNo more, like dewdrops from the grass.\n\nThe breeze, the breath of God, is still,\nAnd the mist upon the hill\nShadowy, shadowy, yet unbroken,                            25\nIs a symbol and a token.\r\nHow it hangs upon the trees,\nA mystery of mysteries!\n\n\n\nTO ----\n\n\nI heed not that my earthly lot\n  Hath little of Earth in it,\nThat years of love have been forgot\n  In the hatred of a minute:\n\nI mourn not that the desolate                               5\n  Are happier, sweet, than I,\nBut that you sorrow for my fate\n  Who am a passer-by.\n\n\n\nROMANCE\n\n\nRomance, who loves to nod and sing\r\nWith drowsy head and folded wing\nAmong the green leaves as they shake\nFar down within some shadowy lake,\nTo me a painted paroquet                                    5\nHath been--a most familiar bird--\nTaught me my alphabet to say,\nTo lisp my very earliest word\nWhile in the wild-wood I did lie,\nA child--with a most knowing eye.                          10\n\nOf late, eternal condor years\nSo shake the very heaven on high\r\nWith tumult as they thunder by,\nI have no time for idle cares\nThrough gazing on the unquiet sky;                         15\nAnd when an hour with calmer wings\nIts down upon my spirit flings,\nThat little time with lyre and rhyme\nTo while away--forbidden things--\nMy heart would feel to be a crime                          20\nUnless it trembled with the strings.\n\n\n\nTO THE RIVER\n\n\nFair river! in thy bright, clear flow","Of crystal, wandering water,\nThou art an emblem of the glow\n    Of beauty--the unhidden heart,\n    The playful maziness of art                             5\n  In old Alberto's daughter;\n\nBut when within thy wave she looks,\n  Which glistens then, and trembles,\nWhy, then, the prettiest of brooks\n  Her worshipper resembles;                                10\nFor in his heart, as in thy stream,\r\nHer image deeply lies--\nHis heart which trembles at the beam\n  Of her soul-searching eyes.\n\n\n\nTO SCIENCE\n\nA PROLOGUE TO \"AL AARAAF\"\n\n\nScience! true daughter of Old Time thou art,\n  Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.\nWhy preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,\n  Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?\nHow should he love thee?

that was the reason (as all men know,\n  In this kingdom by the sea)\nThat the wind came out of the cloud by night,              25\n  Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.\n\nBut our love it was stronger by far than the love\n  Of those who were older than we,\n  Of many far wiser than we;\nAnd neither the angels in heaven above,                    30\n  Nor the demons down under the sea,\nCan ever dissever my soul from the soul\n  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:\n\nFor the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams\n  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;                            35\nAnd the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes\n  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\r\nAnd so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\nOf my darling--my darling--my life and my bride,\n  In her sepulchre there by the sea,                       40\n  In her tomb by the sounding sea.\n\n\n\nTO MY MOTHER\n\n\nBecause I feel that, in the Heavens above,\n  The angels, whispering to one another,\nCan find among their burning terms of love--\n  None so devotional as that of \"Mother,\"","Therefore by that dear name I long have called you--        5\n  You who are more than mother unto me,\nAnd fill my heart of hearts where Death installed you\n  In setting my Virginia's spirit free.\nMy mother, my own mother, who died early,\n  Was but the mother of myself; but you                    10\nAre mother to the one I loved so dearly,\n  And thus are dearer than the mother I knew\nBy that infinity with which my wife\r\nWas dearer to my soul than its soul-life.\n\n\n\nELDORADO\n\n\nGayly bedight,\nA gallant knight,\nIn sunshine and in shadow,\nHad journeyed long,\nSinging a song,                                             5\nIn search of Eldorado.\n\nBut he grew old,\nThis knight so bold,\nAnd o'er his heart a shadow\nFell as he found                                           10\nNo spot of ground\nThat looked like Eldorado.\n\nAnd, as his strength\r\nFailed him at length,\nHe met a pilgrim shadow:                                   15\n\"Shadow,\" said he,\n\"Where can it be,\nThis land of Eldorado?\"\n\n\"Over the Mountains\nOf the Moon,                                               20\nDown the Valley of the Shadow,\nRide, boldly ride,\"\nThe shade replied,\n\"If you seek for Eldorado!\"\n\n\n\n\nTALES\n\n\n\nTHE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER\n\n  Son coeur est un luth suspendu;\r\nSitôt qu'on le touche il résonne.\n                           Béranger\n\n\nDuring the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of\nthe year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had\nbeen passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of\ncountry; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew\non, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it\r\nwas--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of\ninsufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the\nfeeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because\npoetic, sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the\nsternest natural images of the desolate or terrible.  I looked upon\nthe scene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape","features of the domain, upon the bleak walls, upon the vacant eye-like\nwindows, upon a few rank sedges, and upon a few white trunks of\ndecayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to\nno earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the\nreveller upon opium: the bitter lapse into everyday life, the hideous\ndropping off of the veil.  There was an iciness, a sinking, a\nsickening of the heart, an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no\ngoading of the imagination could torture into aught of the\nsublime. What was it--I paused to think--what was it that so unnerved\nme in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all\ninsoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded\nupon me as I pondered.  I was forced to fall back upon the\r\nunsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there _are_\ncombinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of\nthus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among\nconsiderations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a\nmere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the\ndetails of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to\r\nannihilate, its capacity for sorrowful impression; and acting upon\nthis idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and\nlurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed\ndown--but with a shudder even more thrilling than before--upon the\nremodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly\ntree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.\n\nNevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a\r\nsojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of\nmy boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our\nlast meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant\npart of the country--a letter from him--which in its wildly\ninportunate nature had admitted of no other than a personal reply.\nThe MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute","bodily illness, of a mental disorder which oppressed him, and of an\nearnest desire to see me, as his best and indeed his only personal\nfriend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society,\nsome alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this,\nand much more, was said--it was the apparent _heart_ that went\nwith his request--which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I\r\naccordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular\nsummons.\n\nAlthough as boys we had been even intimate associates, yet I really\nknew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and\nhabitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been\nnoted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament,\ndisplaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art,\r\nand manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive\ncharity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies,\nperhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable\nbeauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable\nfact that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had\nput forth at no period any enduring branch; in other words, that the\r\nentire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with\nvery trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this\ndeficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect\nkeeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character\nof the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which\nthe one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the\r\nother--it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the\nconsequent undeviating transmission from sire to son of the patrimony\nwith the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge\nthe original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal\nappellation of the \"House of Usher\"--an appellation which seemed to\ninclude, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family","and the family mansion.\n\nI have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment,\nthat of looking down within the tarn, had been to deepen the first\nsingular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of\nthe rapid increase of my superstition--for why should I not so term\nit?--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have\nlong known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as\r\na basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I\nagain uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the\npool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous,\nindeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the\nsensations which oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as\nreally to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung\r\nan atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity: an\natmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had\nreeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent\ntarn: a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly\ndiscernible, and leaden-hued.\n\nShaking off from my spirit what _must_ have been a dream, I\nscanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal\r\nfeature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.  The\ndiscoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread the\nwhole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet\nall this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of\nthe masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency\nbetween its still perfect adaptation of parts and the crumbling","condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that\nreminded one of the specious totality of old wood-work which has\nrotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance\nfrom the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of\nextensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of\ninstability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have\ndiscovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the\nroof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag\ndirection, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.\n\nNoticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A\nservant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of\nthe hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence,\r\nthrough many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio\nof his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know\nnot how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already\nspoken. While the objects around me--while the carvings of the\nceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of\nthe floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as\r\nI strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been\naccustomed from my infancy--while I hesitated not to acknowledge how\nfamiliar was all this--I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were\nthe fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the\nstaircases, I met the physician of the family. His countenance, I\nthought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity.  He","accosted me with trepidation and passed on.  The valet now threw open\na door and ushered me into the presence of his master.\n\nThe room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.  The\nwindows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from\nthe black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from\nwithin. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the\ntrellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more\nprominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach\nthe remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and\nfretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general\nfurniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books\nand musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any\r\nvitality to the scene. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of\nsorrow. An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and\npervaded all.\n\nUpon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying\nat full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much\nin it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality--of the\nconstrained effort of the _ennuyé_ man of the world. A glance,\r\nhowever, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We\nsat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him\nwith a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely man had never before\nso terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It\nwas with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of\nthe wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet","the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A\ncadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous\nbeyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a\nsurpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but\nwith a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely\nmoulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral\nenergy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these\nfeatures, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the\ntemple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten.\n\nAnd now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these\nfeatures, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much\nof change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of\r\nthe skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things\nstartled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to\ngrow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated\nrather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort,\nconnect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\n\nIn the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence,\r\nan inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of\nfeeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy, an\nexcessive nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed\nbeen prepared, no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain\nboyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical\nconformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and\r\nsullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the\nanimal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of\nenergetic concision--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and\nhollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly\nmodulated guttural utterance--which may be observed in the lost\ndrunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of\nhis most intense excitement.","It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest\ndesire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He\nentered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of\nhis malady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and\none for which he despaired to find a remedy--a mere nervous affection,\nhe immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It\r\ndisplayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as\nhe detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the\nterms and the general manner of the narration had their weight. He\nsuffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid\nfood was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain\ntexture; the odors of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were\r\ntortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds,\nand these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with\nhorror.\n\nTo an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. \"I\nshall perish,\" said he, \"I _must_ perish in this deplorable\nfolly. Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the\nevents of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I\r\nshudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which\nmay operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed,\nno abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect--in terror. In\nthis unnerved--in this pitiable condition, I feel that the period will\nsooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together,\nin some struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR.\"\n\nI learned moreover at intervals, and through broken and equivocal\nhints, another singular feature of his mental condition.  He was\nenchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the\ndwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never\nventured forth--in regard to an influence whose supposititious force\nwas conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated--an influence","which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family\nmansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his\nspirit--an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets,\nand of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length,\nbrought about upon the morale of his existence.\n\nHe admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the\npeculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more\nnatural and far more palpable origin--to the severe and long-continued\nillness, indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution, of a\ntenderly beloved sister--his sole companion for long years, his last\nand only relative on earth. \"Her decease,\" he said, with a bitterness\nwhich I can never forget, \"would leave him (him the hopeless and the\r\nfrail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers.\" While he spoke,\nthe lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a\nremote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my\npresence, disappeared. I regarded her with an utter astonishment not\nunmingled with dread, and yet I found it impossible to account for\nsuch feelings. A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed\nher retreating steps.  When a door, at length, closed upon her, my\nglance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the\nbrother; but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only\nperceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the\nemaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.\n\nThe disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her\r\nphysicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person,\nand frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical\ncharacter, were the unusual diagnosis.  Hitherto she had steadily\nborne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken\nherself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my\narrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night\nwith inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the\ndestroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person\nwould thus probably be the last I should obtain--that the lady, at\nleast while living, would be seen by me no more.\n\nFor several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or\nmyself; and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to","alleviate the melancholy of my friend.  We painted and read together;\nor I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his\nspeaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy\nadmitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the\nmore bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a\nmind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured\r\nforth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one\nunceasing radiation of gloom.\n\nI shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus\nspent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail\nin any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the\nstudies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the\nway. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous\r\nlustre over all.  His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my\nears.  Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular\nperversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von\nWeber. From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and\nwhich grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the\nmore thrillingly because I shuddered knowing not why;--from these\r\npaintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain\nendeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within\nthe compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity, by the\nnakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention.  If ever\nmortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at\nleast, in the circumstances then surrounding me, there arose, out of\r\nthe pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon\nhis canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I\never yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too\nconcrete reveries of Fuseli.\n\nOne of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so\nrigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although\nfeebly, in words.  A small picture presented the interior of an","immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls,\nsmooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain accessory\npoints of the design served well to convey the idea that this\nexcavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the\nearth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and\nno torch or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a\r\nflood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a\nghastly and inappropriate splendor.\n\nI have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve\nwhich rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the\nexception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps,\nthe narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar,\nwhich gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his\nperformances. But the fervid _facility_ of his impromptus could\nnot be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes,\nas well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently\naccompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of\nthat intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have\r\npreviously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the\nhighest artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I\nhave easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed\nwith it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its\nmeaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full\nconsciousness, on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty\r\nreason upon her throne.  The verses, which were entitled \"The Haunted\nPalace,\" ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:--\n\n\nI\n\nIn the greenest of our valleys\n  By good angels tenanted,\nOnce a fair and stately palace--\n  Radiant palace--reared its head.\nIn the monarch Thought's dominion,\n  It stood there;\nNever seraph spread a pinion\n  Over fabric half so fair.\n\nII\n\nBanners yellow, glorious, golden,","On its roof did float and flow,\n(This--all this--was in the olden\n  Time long ago)\nAnd every gentle air that dallied,\n  In that sweet day,\nAlong the ramparts plumed and pallid,\n  A wingéd odor went away.\n\nIII\n\nWanderers in that happy valley\n  Through two luminous windows saw\nSpirits moving musically\n  To a lute's well-tunéd law,\nRound about a throne where, sitting,\n  Porphyrogene,\nIn state his glory well befitting,\n  The ruler of the realm was seen.\n\nIV\n\nAnd all with pearl and ruby glowing\n  Was the fair palace door,\nThrough which came flowing, flowing, flowing,\n  And sparkling evermore,\nA troop of Echoes whose sweet duty\n  Was but to sing,\nIn voices of surpassing beauty,\n  The wit and wisdom of their king.\n\nV\n\nBut evil things, in robes of sorrow,\n  Assailed the monarch's high estate;\r\n(Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow\n  Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)\nAnd round about his home the glory\n  That blushed and bloomed\nIs but a dim-remembered story\n  Of the old time entombed.\n\nVI\n\nAnd travellers now within that valley\n  Through the red-litten windows see\nVast forms that move fantastically\n  To a discordant melody;\nWhile, like a ghastly rapid river,\n  Through the pale door\nA hideous throng rush out forever,\n  And laugh--but smile no more.\n\n\nI well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into\na train of thought, wherein there became manifest an opinion of\nUsher's which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for\nother men[1] haye thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with\nwhich he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of\r\nthe sentience of all vegetable things. But in his disordered fancy the\nidea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under\ncertain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words\nto express the full extent, or the earnest _abandon_ of his\npersuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously\nhinted) with the gray stones of the home of his fore-fathers. The\nconditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in\nthe method of collocation of these stones--in the order of their\narrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread\nthem, and of the decayed trees which stood around--above all, in the\nlong undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its\nreduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence--the","evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he said (and I here started\nas he spoke), in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere\nof their own about the waters and the walls. The result was\ndiscoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible\ninfluence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family,\nand which made _him_ what I now saw him--what he was. Such\r\nopinions need no comment, and I will make none.\n\n[Footnote 1: Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the\nBishop of Landaff.--See \"Chemical Essays,\" Vol. V.]\n\nOur books--the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of\nthe mental existence of the invalid--were, as might be supposed, in\nstrict keeping with this character of phantasm. We pored together over\nsuch works as the Ververt and Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of\r\nMachiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean\nVoyage of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of\nJean D'Indaginé, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue\nDistance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite\nvolume was a small octavo edition of the _Directorium\nInquisitorum_, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were\npassages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and Ægipans,\nover which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight,\nhowever, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious\nbook in quarto Gothic--the manual of a forgotten church--the\n_Vigilice Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiæ Maguntinæ_.\n\nI could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its","probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when one evening, having\ninformed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his\nintention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its\nfinal interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls\nof the building.  The worldly reason, however, assigned for this\nsingular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to\ndispute.  The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me)\nby consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the\ndeceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her\nmedical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the\nburial-ground of the family. I will not deny that when I called to\nmind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the\r\nstaircase, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to\noppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an\nunnatural, precaution.\n\nAt the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements\nfor the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two\nalone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which\nhad been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its\r\noppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation)\nwas small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light;\nlying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the\nbuilding in which was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used,\napparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a\ndonjon-keep, and in later days as a place of deposit for powder, or\r\nsome other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor,\nand the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it,\nwere carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had\nbeen, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an\nunusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.\n\nHaving deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region","of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the\ncoffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude\nbetween the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and\nUsher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words\nfrom which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and\nthat sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed\r\nbetween them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for\nwe could not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed\nthe lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies\nof a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush\nupon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile\nupon the lip which is so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed\r\ndown the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with\ntoil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of\nthe house.\n\nAnd now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable\nchange came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His\nordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected\nor forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal,\r\nand objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if\npossible, a more ghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had\nutterly gone out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard\nno more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually\ncharacterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought\nhis unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive\r\nsecret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. At\ntimes, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable\nvagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long\nhours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to\nsome imaginary sound. It was no wonder that his condition\nterrified--that it infected me. I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet","certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet\nimpressive superstitions.\n\nIt was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the\nseventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within\nthe donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep\ncame not near my couch, while the hours waned and waned away. I\nstruggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I\r\nendeavored to believe that much, if not all, of what I felt was due to\nthe bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room--of the\ndark and tattered draperies which, tortured into motion by the breath\nof a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and\nrustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were\nfruitless. An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and at\r\nlength there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless\nalarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself\nupon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness\nof the chamber, hearkened--I know not why, except that an instinctive\nspirit prompted me--to certain low and indefinite sounds which came,\nthrough the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not\nwhence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable\nyet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste, (for I felt that I\nshould sleep no more during the night,) and endeavored to arouse\nmyself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing\nrapidly to and fro through the apartment.\n\nI had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an\r\nadjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognized it\nas that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped with a gentle\ntouch at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as\nusual, cadaverously wan--but, moreover, there was a species of mad\nhilarity in his eyes--an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole\ndemeanor. His air appalled me--but anything was preferable to the","solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence\nas a relief.\n\n\"And you have not seen it?\" he said abruptly, after having stared\nabout him for some moments in silence--\"you have not then seen\nit?--but, stay! you shall.\" Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded\nhis lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open\nto the storm.\n\nThe impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our\r\nfeet. It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and\none wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had\napparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were\nfrequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the\nexceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon\nthe turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like\r\nvelocity with which they flew careering from all points against each\nother, without passing away into the distance. I say that even their\nexceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this; yet we had no\nglimpse of the moon or stars, nor was there any flashing forth of the\nlightning. But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated\nvapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were\r\nglowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly\nvisible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the\nmansion.\n\n\"You must not--you shall not behold this!\" said I, shudderingly, to\nUsher, as I led him with a gentle violence from the window to a\nseat. \"These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical\nphenomena not uncommon--or it may be that they have their ghastly\norigin in the rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement; the\nair is chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your\nfavorite romances. I will read, and you shall listen;--and so we will\npass away this terrible night together.\"\n\nThe antique volume which I had taken up was the \"Mad Trist\" of Sir\nLauncelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher's more in","sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its\nuncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for\nthe lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the\nonly book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the\nexcitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief (for\nthe history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in\r\nthe extremeness of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged,\nindeed, by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he\nhearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might\nwell have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.\n\nI had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred,\nthe hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission\r\ninto the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by\nforce. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run\nthus:--\n\n\"And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now\nmighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had\ndrunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in\nsooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain\r\nupon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted\nhis mace outright, and with blows made quickly room in the plankings\nof the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith\nsturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the\nnoise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated\nthroughout the forest.\"\n\nAt the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment","paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my\nexcited fancy had deceived me)--it appeared to me that from some very\nremote portion of the mansion there came, indistinctly, to my ears,\nwhat might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo\n(but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and\nripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It\nwas, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my\nattention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and\nthe ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the\nsound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or\ndisturbed me. I continued the story:--\n\n\"But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was\r\nsore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit;\nbut, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious\ndemeanor, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace\nof gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield\nof shining brass with this legend enwritten--\n\n  Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;\n  Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win.\n\nAnd Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the\ndragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a\nshriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had\nfain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of\nit, the like whereof was never before heard.\"\n\nHere again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild\r\namazement; for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this\ninstance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it\nproceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant,\nbut harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating\nsound--the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up\nfor the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.\r\nOppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and\nmost extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations,\nin which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained\nsufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the\nsensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that\nhe had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange","alteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his\ndemeanor. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought\nround his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the\nchamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features,\nalthough I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring\ninaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast--yet I knew that he\nwas not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught\na glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at\nvariance with this idea--for he rocked from side to side with a gentle\nyet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all\nthis, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus\nproceeded:--\n\n\"And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the\r\ndragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking\nup of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out\nof the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver\npavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in\nsooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon\nthe silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.\"\r\nNo sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if a shield of\nbrass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of\nsilver--I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic and clangorous,\nyet apparently muffled reverberation.  Completely unnerved, I leaped\nto my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was\nundisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent\r\nfixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned\na stony rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there\ncame a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered\nabout his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and\ngibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence.  Bending closely\nover him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words.","\"Not hear it?--yes, I hear it, and _have_ heard it.\nLong--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard\nit--yet I dared not--oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!--I dared\nnot--I _dared_ not speak! _We have put her living in the\ntomb!_ Said I not that my senses were acute?  I _now_ tell you\nthat I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard\nthem--many, many days ago--yet I dared not--_I dared not speak!_\r\nAnd now--to-night--Ethelred--ha! ha!--the breaking of the hermit's\ndoor, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of the\nshield!--say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of\nthe iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered\narchway of the vault! Oh, whither shall I fly? Will she not be here\nanon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard\r\nher footstep on the stair? Do I not distinguish that heavy and\nhorrible beating of her heart?  Madman!\"--here he sprang furiously to\nhis feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were\ngiving up his soul--\"_Madman! I tell you that she now stands without\nthe door!_\"\n\nAs if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found\nthe potency of a spell, the huge antique panels to hich the speaker\r\npointed threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony\njaws. It was the work of the rushing gust--but then without those\ndoors there _did_ stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the\nlady Madeline of Usher.  There was blood upon her white robes, and the\nevidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated\nframe. For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon\r\nthe threshold--then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon\nthe person of her brother, and, in her violent and now final\ndeath-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the\nterrors he had anticipated.\n\nFrom that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast.  The storm\nwas still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old\ncauseway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I","turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the\nvast house and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that\nof the full, setting, and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly\nthrough that once barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before\nspoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag\ndirection, to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly\nwidened--there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind--the entire orb\nof the satellite burst at once upon my sight--my brain reeled as I saw\nthe mighty walls rushing asunder--there was a long tumultuous shouting\nsound like the voice of a thousand waters--and the deep and dank tarn\nat my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the\n\"_House of Usher_.\"\n\n\n\nWILLIAM WILSON\r\nWhat say of it? what say of CONSCIENCE grim,\n  That spectre in my path?\n               CHAMBERLAYNE: _Pharronida_\n\n\nLet me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair page now\nlying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation. This has\nbeen already too much an object for the scorn--for the horror--for the\ndetestation of my race. To the uttermost regions of the globe have not\r\nthe indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of\nall outcasts most abandoned!--to the earth art thou not forever dead?\nto its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?--and a\ncloud, dense, dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally\nbetween thy hopes and heaven?\n\nI would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later\nyears of unspeakable misery and unpardonable crime.  This epoch, these\r\nlater years, took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude,\nwhose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually\ngrow base by degrees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped\nbodily as a mantle. From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed,\nwith the stride of a giant, into more than the enormities of an\nElah-Gabalus.  What chance--what one event brought this evil thing to","pass, bear with me while I relate. Death approaches; and the shadow\nwhich foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit. I\nlong, in passing through the dim valley, for the sympathy--I had\nnearly said for the pity--of my fellow-men. I would fain have them\nbelieve that I have been, in some measure, the slave of circumstances\nbeyond human control.  I would wish them to seek out for me, in the\r\ndetails I am about to give, some little oasis of _fatality_ amid a\nwilderness of error. I would have them allow--what they cannot refrain\nfrom allowing--that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as\ngreat, man was never _thus_, at least, tempted before--certainly,\nnever _thus_ fell. And is it therefore that he has never thus\nsuffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream? And am I not now\r\ndying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all\nsublunary visions?\n\nI am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable\ntemperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my\nearliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family\ncharacter. As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed;\nbecoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my\r\nfriends, and of positive injury to myself. I grew self-willed,\naddicted to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable\npassions.  Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin\nto my own, my parents could do but little to check the evil\npropensities which distinguished me. Some feeble and ill-directed\nefforts resulted in complete failure on their part, and, of course, in\ntotal triumph on mine. Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and\nat an age when few children have abandoned their leading-strings I was\nleft to the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the\nmaster of my own actions.\n\nMy earliest recollections of a school-life are connected with a large,\nrambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England,","where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all\nthe houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-like and\nspirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, in\nfancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed\navenues, inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill\nanew with undefinable delight at the deep hollow note of the\r\nchurch-bell, breaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon\nthe stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic\nsteeple lay imbedded and asleep.\n\nIt gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner\nexperience to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its\nconcerns. Steeped in misery as I am--misery, alas! only too real--I\nshall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in\r\nthe weakness of a few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly\ntrivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume to my fancy\nadventitious importance, as connected with a period and a locality\nwhen and where I recognize the first ambiguous monitions of the\ndestiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me. Let me then\nremember.\n\nThe house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were\nextensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of\nmortar and broken glass, encompassed the whole.  This prison-like\nrampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a\nweek--once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we\nwere permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the\nneighboring fields--and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in\r\nthe same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one\nchurch of the village. Of this church the principal of our school was\npastor. With how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to\nregard him from our remote pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn\nand slow, he ascended the pulpit! This reverend man, with countenance\nso demurely benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing,","with wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast,--could this be he\nwho, of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments,\nadministered, ferule in hand, the Draconian Laws of the academy? Oh,\ngigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!\n\nAt an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It\nwas riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged\r\niron spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! It was never\nopened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions\nalready mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found\na plenitude of mystery--a world of matter for solemn remark, or for\nmore solemn meditation.\n\nThe extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious\nrecesses. Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the\r\nplay-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well\nremember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within\nit. Of course it was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small\nparterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred\ndivision we passed only upon rare occasions indeed--such as a first\nadvent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps when, a parent\r\nor friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the\nChristmas or Midsummer holidays.\n\nBut the house--how quaint an old building was this!--to me how\nveritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its\nwindings--to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult, at\nany given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories\none happened to be. From each room to every other there were sure to\nbe found three or four steps either in ascent or descent. Then the\nlateral branches were innumerable, inconceivable, and so returning in\nupon themselves that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole\nmansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered\nupon infinity. During the five years of my residence here I was never","able to ascertain, with precision, in what remote locality lay the\nlittle sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or\ntwenty other scholars.\n\nThe school-room was the largest in the house--I could not help\nthinking, in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low,\nwith pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and\nterror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet,\r\ncomprising the _sanctum_, \"during hours,\" of our principal, the\nReverend Dr. Bransby. It was a solid structure, with massy door,\nsooner than open which in the absence of the \"Dominie\" we would all\nhave willingly perished by the _peine forte et dure._ In other angles\nwere two other similar boxes, far less reverenced, indeed, but still\ngreatly matters of awe. One of these was the pulpit of the \"classical\"\r\nusher; one, of the \"English and mathematical.\"  Interspersed about the\nroom, crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity, were\ninnumerable benches and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled\ndesperately with much-be-thumbed books, and so beseamed with initial\nletters, names at full length, grotesque figures, and other multiplied\nefforts of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little of original\nform might have been their portion in days long departed. A huge\nbucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and a clock of\nstupendous dimensions at the other.\n\nEncompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed,\nyet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my\nlife. The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of\r\nincident to occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of\na school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth\nhas derived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must\nbelieve that my first mental development had in it much of the\nuncommon--even much of the _outré_. Upon mankind at large the events\nof very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite","impression. All is gray shadow--a weak and irregular remembrance--an\nindistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric\npains. With me this is not so. In childhood I must have felt, with the\nenergy of a man, what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as\nvivid, as deep, and as durable as the _exergues_ of the Carthaginian\nmedals.\n\nYet in fact--in the fact of the world's view--how little was there to\r\nremember! The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to bed; the\nconnings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and\nperambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its\nintrigues;--these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to\ninvolve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an\nuniverse of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and\nspirit-stirring.  \"_Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!_\"\r\nIn truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my\ndisposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates,\nand by slow but natural gradations gave me an ascendancy over all not\ngreatly older than myself: over all with a single exception. This\nexception was found in the person of a scholar who, although no\nrelation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself,--a\r\ncircumstance, in fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a noble\ndescent, mine was one of those every-day appellations which seem by\nprescriptive right to have been, time out of mind, the common property\nof the mob. In this narrative I have therefore designated myself as\nWilliam Wilson,--a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the\nreal. My namesake alone, of those who in school-phraseology\r\nconstituted \"our set,\" presumed to compete with me in the studies of\nthe class--in the sports and broils of the play-ground--to refuse\nimplicit belief in my assertions, and submission to my will--indeed,\nto interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever.\nIf there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the\ndespotism of a master-mind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits","of its companions.\n\nWilson's rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment;\nthe more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in public I made a\npoint of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly felt that I\nfeared him, and could not help thinking the equality, which he\nmaintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority;\nsince not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle. Yet this\r\nsuperiority, even this equality, was in truth acknowledged by no one\nbut myself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed\nnot even to suspect it. Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and\nespecially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes,\nwere not more pointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike\nof the ambition which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind\r\nwhich enabled, me to excel. In his rivalry he might have been supposed\nactuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify\nmyself; although there were times when I could not help observing,\nwith a feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique, that he\nmingled with his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a\ncertain most inappropriate, and assuredly most unwelcome,\n_affectionateness_ of manner. I could only conceive this singular\nbehavior to arise from a consummate self-conceit assuming the vulgar\nairs of patronage and protection.\n\nPerhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson's conduct, conjoined with\nour identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the\nschool upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were\r\nbrothers, among the senior classes in the academy. These do not\nusually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their\njuniors. I have before said, or should have said, that Wilson was not\nin the most remote degree connected with my family. But assuredly if\nwe _had_ been brothers we must have been twins; for, after leaving\nDr. Bransby's, I cassually learned that my namesake was born on the","nineteenth of January, 1813; and this is a somewhat remarkable\ncoincidence; for the day is precisely that of my own nativity.\n\nIt may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned\nme by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of\ncontradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We\nhad, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me\npublicly the palm of victory, he, in some manner, contrieved to make\r\nme feel that it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my\npart, and a veritable dignity on his own, kept us always upon what are\ncalled \"speaking terms,\" while there were many points of strong\ncongeniality in our tempers, operating to awake in me a sentiment\nwhich our position alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into\nfriendship. It is difficult, indeed, to define, or even to describe,\nmy real feelings towards him. They formed a motley and heterogeneous\nadmixture: some petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred, some\nesteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity. To\nthe moralist it will be unnecessary to say, in addition, that Wilson\nand myself were the most inseparable of companions.\n\nIt was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us\r\nwhich turned all my attacks upon him (and they were many, either open\nor covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain\nwhile assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious\nand determined hostility. But my endeavors on this head were by no\nmeans uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily\nconcocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that\r\nunassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of\nits own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely\nrefuses to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable\npoint, and that lying in a personal peculiarity arising, perhaps, from\nconstitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less\nat his wit's end than myself:--my rival had a weakness in the faucial","or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any\ntime _above a very low whisper_. Of this defect I did not fail to take\nwhat poor advantage lay in my power.\n\nWilson's retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of his\npractical wit that disturbed me beyond measure.  How his sagacity\nfirst discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a\nquestion I never could solve; but having discovered, he habitually\npractised the annoyance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly\npatronymic, and its very common, if not plebeian praenomen. The words\nwere venom in my ears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second\nWilliam Wilson came also to the academy, I felt angry with him for\nbearing the name, and doubly disgusted with the name because a\r\nstranger bore it, who would be the cause of its twofold repetition,\nwho would be constantly in my presence, and whose concerns, in the\nordinary routine of the school business, must inevitably, on account\nof the detestable coincidence, be often confounded with my own.\n\nThe feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every\ncircumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between\r\nmy rival and myself. I had not then discovered the remarkable fact\nthat we were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same\nheight, and I perceived that we were even singularly alike in general\ncontour of person and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the\nrumor touching a relationship which had grown current in the upper\nforms.  In a word, nothing could more seriously disturb me (although I\r\nscrupulously concealed such disturbance) than any allusion to a\nsimilarity of mind, person, or condition existing between us. But, in\ntruth, I had no reason to believe that (with the exception of the\nmatter of relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself) this\nsimilarity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even observed\nat all by our schoolfellows. That _he_ observed it in all its","bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he could\ndiscover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance can\nonly be attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary\npenetration.\n\nHis cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in\nwords and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My\ndress it was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner were,\r\nwithout difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional\ndefect, even my voice did not escape him.  My louder tones were, of\ncourse, unattempted, but then the key,--it was identical; _and his\nsingular whisper,--it grew the very echo of my own._\n\nHow greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me (for it could\nnot justly be termed a caricature) I will not now venture to describe.\nI had but one consolation--in the fact that the imitation, apparently,\r\nwas noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing\nand strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied with\nhaving produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle\nin secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was\nuncharacteristically disregardful of the public applause which the\nsuccess of his witty endeavours might have so easily elicited.  That\r\nthe school, indeed, did not feel his design, perceive its\naccomplishment, and participate in his sneer, was, for many anxious\nmonths, a riddle I could not resolve. Perhaps the _gradation_ of his\ncopy rendered it not so readily perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed\nmy security to the masterly air of the copyist, who, disdaining the\nletter (which in a painting is all the obtuse can see) gave but the\r\nfull spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and\nchagrin.\n\nI have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of\npatronage which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious\ninterference with my will. This interference often took the ungracious\ncharacter of advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or\ninsinuated. I received it with a repugnance which gained strength as I","grew in years. Yet, at this distant day, let me do him the simple\njustice to acknowledge that I can recall no occasion when the\nsuggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so\nusual to his immature age and seeming inexperience; that his moral\nsense, at least, if not his general talents and worldly wisdom, was\nfar keener than my own; and that I might, to-day, have been a better,\r\nand thus a happier man, had I less frequently rejected the counsels\nembodied in those meaning whispers which I then but too cordially\nhated and too bitterly despised.\n\nAs it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his\ndistasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what\nI considered his intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in the first\nyears of our connection as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him\r\nmight have been easily ripened into friendship; but, in the latter\nmonths of my residence at the academy, although the intrusion of his\nordinary manner had, beyond doubt, in some measure abated, my\nsentiments, in nearly similar proportion, partook very much of\npositive hatred. Upon one occasion he saw this, I think, and\nafterwards avoided or made a show of avoiding me.\n\nIt was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an\naltercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually\nthrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor\nrather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered,\nin his accent, his air and general appearance, a something which first\nstartled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim\r\nvisions of my earliest infancy--wild, confused and thronging memories\nof a time when memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe\nthe sensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with\ndifficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the\nbeing who stood before me, at some epoch very long ago--some point of\nthe past even infinitely remote. The delusion, however, faded rapidly","as it came; and I mention it at all but to define the day of the last\nconversation I there held with my singular namesake.\n\nThe huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several large\nchambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number\nof the students. There were, however (as must necessarily happen in a\nbuilding so awkwardly planned) many little nooks or recesses, the odds\r\nand ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr.\nBransby had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest\nclosets, they were capable of accommodating but a single\nindividual. One of these small apartments was occupied by Wilson.\n\nOne night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and\nimmediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one\nwrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a\nwilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my\nrival. I had long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of\npractical wit at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly\nunsuccessful. It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation,\nand I resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with\r\nwhich I was imbued. Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered,\nleaving the lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a\nstep, and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of\nhis being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again\napproached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which, in the\nprosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright\r\nrays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes at the same moment\nupon his countenance. I looked,--and a numbness, an iciness of\nfeeling, instantly pervaded my frame. My breast heaved, my knees\ntottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet\nintolerable horror. Gasping for breath, I lowered the lamp in still\nnearer proximity to the face. Were these,--_these_ the lineaments of","William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that they were his, but I shook as if\nwith a fit of the ague, in fancying they were not. What _was_ there\nabout them to confound me in this manner? I gazed,--while my brain\nreeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts. Not thus he\nappeared--assuredly not _thus_--in the vivacity of his waking\nhours. The same name! the same contour of person! the same day of\r\narrival at the academy! And then his dogged and meaningless imitation\nof my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! Was it, in truth,\nwithin the bounds of human possibility, that _what I now saw_ was the\nresult, merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation?\nAwe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp,\npassed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that\r\nold academy, never to enter them again.\n\nAfter a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found\nmyself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been sufficient to\nenfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby's, or at least to\neffect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which I\nremembered them. The truth--the tragedy--of the drama was no more. I\ncould now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldom\ncalled up the subject at all but with wonder at the extent of human\ncredulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I\nhereditarily possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely\nto be diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The\nvortex of thoughtless folly, into which I there so immediately and so\r\nrecklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours,\nengulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory\nonly the veriest levities of a former existence.\n\nI do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy\nhere--a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded the\nvigilance, of the institution. Three years of folly, passed without","profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a\nsomewhat unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of\nsoulless dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute\nstudents to a secret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour of\nthe night; for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until\nmorning. The wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and\r\nperhaps more dangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already\nfaintly appeared in the east while our delirious extravagance was at\nits height.  Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the\nact of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity, when my\nattention was suddenly diverted by the violent, although partial,\nunclosing of the door of the apartment, and by the eager voice of a\r\nservant from without. He said that some person, apparently in great\nhaste, demanded to speak with me in the hall.\n\nWildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delighted\nthan surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few steps\nbrought me to the vestibule of the building. In this low and small\nroom there hung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save\nthat of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the\r\nsemicircular window. As I put my foot over the threshold, I became\naware of the figure of a youth about my own height, and habited in a\nwhite kerseymere morning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I\nmyself wore at the moment. This the faint light enabled me to\nperceive; but the features of his face I could not distinguish. Upon\nmy entering, he strode hurriedly up to me, and, seizing me by the arm\r\nwith a gesture of petulant impatience, whispered the words \"William\nWilson!\" in my ear.\n\nI grew perfectly sober in an instant.\n\nThere was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the tremulous\nshake of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my eyes and the\nlight, which filled me with unqualified amazement; but it was not this\nwhich had so violently moved me. It was the pregnancy of solemn","admonition in the singular, low, hissing utterance; and, above all, it\nwas the character, the tone, _the key_, of those few, simple, and\nfamiliar, yet _whispered_ syllables, which came with a thousand\nthronging memories of by-gone days, and struck upon my soul with the\nshock of a galvanic battery. Ere I could recover the use of my senses\nhe was gone.\n\nAlthough this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered\nimagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, I\nbusied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid\nspeculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the\nidentity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered\nwith my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. But who\r\nand what was this Wilson?--and whence came he?--and what were his\npurposes? Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied--merely\nascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family\nhad caused his removal from Dr. Bransby's academy on the afternoon of\nthe day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief period I ceased\nto think upon the subject, my attention being all absorbed in a\r\ncontemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon went, the\nuncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and\nannual establishment which would enable me to indulge at will in the\nluxury already so dear to my hear--to vie in profuseness of\nexpenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in\nGreat Britain.\n\nExcited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament\r\nbroke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common\nrestraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it were\nabsurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that\namong spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a\nmultitude of novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long\ncatalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of","Europe.\n\nIt could hardly be credited, however, that I had even here, so utterly\nfallen from the gentlemanly estate as to seek acquaintance with the\nvilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept\nin his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of\nincreasing my already enormous income at the expense of the\nweak-minded among my fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the\r\nfact. And the very enormity of this offence against all manly and\nhonorable sentiment proved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole\nreason of the impunity with which it was committed.  Who, indeed,\namong my most abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the\nclearest evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such courses\nthe gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson--the noblest and most\r\nliberal commoner at Oxford: him whose follies (said his parasites)\nwere but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy--whose errors but\ninimitable whim--whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing\nextravagance?\n\nI had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there\ncame to the university a young _parvenu_ nobleman, Glendinning--rich,\nsaid report, as Herodes Atticus--his riches, too, as easily\r\nacquired. I soon found him of weak intellect, and of course marked him\nas a fitting subject for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play,\nand contrived, with the gambler's usual art, to let him win\nconsiderable sums, the more effectually to entangle him in my\nsnares. At length, my schemes being ripe, I met him (with the full\nintention that this meeting should be final and decisive) at the\nchambers of a fellow-commoner (Mr. Preston) equally intimate with\nboth, but who, to do him justice, entertained not even a remote\nsuspicion of my design. To give to this a better coloring, I had\ncontrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten, and was\nsolicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear\naccidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe","himself. To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was\nomitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter\nfor wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.\n\nWe had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length\neffected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole\nantagonist. The game, too, was my favorite _écarté_. The rest of the\r\ncompany, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned their own\ncards, and were standing around us as spectators. The _parvenu_, who\nhad been induced, by my artifices in the early part of the evening, to\ndrink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness\nof manner for which his intoxication, I thought, might partially but\ncould not altogether account. In a very short period he had become my\r\ndebtor to a large amount, when, having taken a long draught of port,\nhe did precisely what I had been coolly anticipating--he proposed to\ndouble our already extravagant stakes.  With a well-feigned show of\nreluctance, and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him\ninto some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance,\ndid I finally comply.  The result, of course, did but prove how\r\nentirely the prey was in my toils; in less than an hour he had\nquadrupled his debt.  For some time his countenance had been losing\nthe florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I\nperceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful. I say, to my\nastonishment. Glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries\nas immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as yet lost,\r\nalthough in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very seriously\nannoy, much less so violently affect him. That he was overcome by the\nwine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented itself;\nand, rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the\neyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, I was\nabout to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when","some expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an\nejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave me\nto understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances\nwhich, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have\nprotected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.\n\nWhat now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say.  The\npitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom\r\nover all; and for some moments a profound silence was maintained,\nduring which I could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many\nburning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less\nabandoned of the party. I will even own that an intolerable weight of\nanxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and\nextraordinary interruption which ensued. The wide, heavy folding-doors\r\nof the apartment were all at once thrown open, to their full extent,\nwith a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by\nmagic, every candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us\njust to perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and\nclosely muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now total; and\nwe could only _feel_ that he was standing in our midst. Before any one\r\nof us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this\nrudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten\n_whisper_ which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, \"gentlmen, I\nmake no apology for this behavior, because, in thus behaving, I am but\nfulfilling a duty. You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true\r\ncharacter of the person who has to-night won at _écarté_ a large sum\nof money from Lord Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an\nexpeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary\ninformation. Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of\nthe cuff of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may\nbe found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning","wrapper.\"\n\nWhile he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have\nheard a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once, and\nas abruptly as he had entered. Can I--shall I describe my sensations?\nMust I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned? Most assuredly I\nhad little time for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the\nspot, and lights were immediately re-procured. A search ensued. In the\r\nlining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in\n_écarté_, and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs,\nfacsimiles of those used at our sittings, with the single exception\nthat mine were of the species called, technically, _arrondis_; the\nhonors being slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly\nconvex at the sides. In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as\r\ncustomary, at the length of the pack, will invariably find that he\ncuts his antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the\nbreadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may\ncount in the records of the game.\n\nAny burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me\nless than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which\nit was received.\n\n\"Mr. Wilson,\" said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet\nan exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, \"Mr. Wilson, this is your\nproperty.\"  (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I\nhad thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon\nreaching the scene of play.) \"I presume it is supererogatory to seek\nhere\" (eying the folds of the garment with a bitter smile) \"for any\r\nfarther evidence of your skill. Indeed, we have had enough. You will\nsee the necessity, I hope, of quitting Oxford--at all events, of\nquitting instantly my chambers.\"\n\nAbased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I\nshould have resented this galling language by immediate personal\nviolence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a\nfact of the most startling character. The cloak which I had worn was","of a rare description of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I\nshall not venture to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic\ninvention; for I was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in\nmatters of this frivolous nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached\nme that which he had picked up upon the floor, and near the\nfolding-doors of the apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly\r\nbordering upon terror, that I perceived my own already hanging on my\narm, (where I had no doubt unwittingly placed it) and that the one\npresented me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even the\nminutest possible particular. The singular being who had so\ndisastrously exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak;\nand none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party, with\nthe exception of myself. Retaining some presence of mind, I took the\none offered me by Preston; placed it, unnoticed, over my own; left the\napartment with a resolute scowl of defiance; and, next morning ere\ndawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Oxford to the continent,\nin a perfect agony of horror and of shame.\n\n\n_I fled in vain._ My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and\r\nproved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as\nyet only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris, ere I had fresh\nevidence of the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my\nconcerns. Years flew, while I experienced no relief. Villain!--at\nRome, with how untimely, yet with how spectral an officiousness,\nstepped he in between me and my ambition! At Vienna, too--at\r\nBerlin--and at Moscow!  Where, in truth, had I _not_ bitter cause to\ncurse him within my heart? From his inscrutable tyranny did I at\nlength flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence; and to the very\nends of the earth _I fled in vain._\n\nAnd again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would I\ndemand the questions, \"Who is he?--whence came he?--and what are his\nobjects?\" But no answer was there found. And now I scrutinized, with a","minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of\nhis impertinent supervision. But even here there was very little upon\nwhich to base a conjecture. It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one\nof the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path,\nhad he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb\nthose actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in\nbitter mischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority\nso imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of\nself-agency so pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!\n\nI had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long\nperiod of time (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity\nmaintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself) had so\r\ncontrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my\nwill, that I saw not, at any moment, the features of his face. Be\nWilson what he might, _this_, at least, was but the veriest of\naffectation, or of folly. Could he, for an instant, have supposed\nthat, in my admonisher at Eton--in the destroyer of my honor at\nOxford,--in him who thwarted my ambition at Rome, my revenge at Paris,\r\nmy passionate love at Naples, or what he falsely termed my avarice in\nEgypt,--that in this, my arch-enemy and evil genius, I could fail to\nrecognize the William Wilson of my schoolboy days: the namesake, the\ncompanion, the rival, the hated and dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby's?\nImpossible!--but let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the\ndrama.\n\nThus far I had succumbed suginely to this imperious domination. The\r\nsentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated\ncharacter, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and\nomnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which\ncertain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had\noperated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter\nweakness and helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although\nbitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will.  But, of late","days, I had given myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening\ninfluence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more\nimpatient of control. I began to murmur, to hesitate, to resist.  And\nwas it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the increase\nof my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional\ndiminution? Be this as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of\r\na burning hope, and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern\nand desperate resolution that I would submit no longer to be enslaved.\n\nIt was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18--, that I attended a\nmasquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I had\nindulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and\nnow the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me\r\nbeyond endurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the\nmazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my\ntemper; for I was anxiously seeking (let me not say with what unworthy\nmotive) the young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting\nDi Broglio. With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously\ncommunicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be\r\nhabited, and now, having caught a glimpse of her person, I was\nhurrying to make my way into her presence. At this moment I felt a\nlight hand placed upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low,\ndamnable _whisper_ within my ear.\n\nIn an absolute frenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus\ninterrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar. He was\nattired, as I had expected, in a costume altogether similar to my own;\nwearing a Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a\ncrimson belt sustaining a rapier. A mask of black silk entirely\ncovered his face.\n\n\"Scoundrel!\" I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable\nI uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury; \"scoundrel! impostor!\naccursed villain! you shall not--you _shall not_ dog me unto death!","Follow me, or I stab you where you stand!\"--and I broke my way from\nthe ball-room into a small ante-chamber adjoining, dragging him\nunresistingly with me as I went.\n\nUpon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against\nthe wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to\ndraw. He hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew\nin silence, and put himself upon his defence.\r\nThe contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wild\nexcitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a\nmultitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the\nwainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with\nbrute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.\n\nAt that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastened to\r\nprevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying\nantagonist. But what human language can adequately portray _that_\nastonishment, _that_ horror which possessed me at the spectacle then\npresented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had\nbeen sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the\narrangements at the upper or farther end of the room. A large\nmirror--so at first it seemed to me in my confusion--now stood where\nnone had been perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in\nextremity of terror, mine own image, but with features all pale and\ndabbled in blood, advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering\ngait.\n\nThus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist--it was\nWilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution.\r\nHis mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon the floor. Not\na thread in all his raiment--not a line in all the marked and singular\nlineaments of his face which was not, even in the most absolute\nidentity, _mine own_!\n\nIt was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could have\nfancied that I myself was speaking while he said:--\n\n_\"You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also","dead--dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst thou\nexist--and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how\nutterly thou hast murdered thyself.\"_\n\n\n\nA DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTRÖM\n\n  The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as _our_ ways;\n  nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the\n  vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, _which have\r\na depth in them greater than the well of Democritus_.\n                                          JOSEPH GLANVILLE\n\n\nWe had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes\nthe old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.\n\n\"Not long ago,\" said he at length, \"and I could have guided you on\nthis route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years\npast, there happened to me an event such as never happened before to\nmortal man--or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of--and\nthe six hours of deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up\nbody and soul. You suppose me a _very_ old man--but I am not. It took\nless than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to\nwhite, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I\r\ntremble at the least exertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you\nknow I can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting\ngiddy?\"\n\nThe \"little cliff,\" upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown\nhimself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over\nit, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on\nits extreme and slippery edge--this \"little cliff\" arose, a sheer\r\nunobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen\nhundred feet from the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would have\ntempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so\ndeeply was I excited by the perilous position of my companion, that I\nfell at full length upon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me,\nand dared not even glance upward at the sky--while I struggled in vain","to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain\nwere in danger from the fury of the winds. It was long before I could\nreason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the\ndistance.\n\n\"You must get over these fancies,\" said the guide, \"for I have brought\nyou here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of\nthat event I mentioned--and to tell you the whole story with the spot\r\njust under your eye.\n\n\"We are now,\" he continued, in that particularizing manner which\ndistinguished him--\"we are now close upon the Norwegian coast--in the\nsixty-eighth degree of latitude--in the great province of\nNordland--and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon\nwhose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a\nlittle higher--hold on to the grass if you feel giddy--so--and look\r\nout, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea.\"\n\nI looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters\nwore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian\ngeographer's account of the _Mare Tenebrarum_. A panorama more\ndeplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive. To the right\nand left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay outstretched, like\nramparts of the world, lines of horridly black and beetling cliff,\nwhose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the\nsurf which reared high up against it its white and ghastly crest,\nhowling and shrieking forever. Just opposite the promontory upon whose\napex we were placed, and at a distance of some five or six miles out\nat sea, there was visible a small, bleak-looking island; or, more\r\nproperly, its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge\nin which it was enveloped. About two miles nearer the land arose\nanother of smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed\nat various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.\n\nThe appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant\nisland and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although,","at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the\nremote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly\nplunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like\na regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water\nin every direction--as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of\nfoam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.\r\n\"The island in the distance,\" resumed the old man, \"is called by the\nNorwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe.  That a mile to the\nnorthward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Iflesen, Hoeyholm, Kieldholm,\nSuarven, and Buckholm.  Farther off--between Moskoe and Vurrgh--are\nOtterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Skarholm. These are the true names\nof the places--but why it has been thought necessary to name them at\nall is more than either you or I can understand. Do you hear anything?\nDo you see any change in the water?\"\n\nWe had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which\nwe had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no\nglimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit. As the\nold man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing\r\nsound, like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American\nprairie; and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the\n_chopping_ character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing\ninto a current which set to the eastward.  Even while I gazed, this\ncurrent acquired a monstrous velocity.  Each moment added to its\nspeed--to its headlong impetuosity.  In five minutes the whole sea, as\r\nfar as Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between\nMoskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway. Here the vast\nbed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting\nchannels, burst suddenly into frenzied convulsion--heaving, boiling,\nhissing--gyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices, and all\nwhirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water","never elsewhere assumes, except in precipitous descents.\n\nIn a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical\nalteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the\nwhirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam\nbecame apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks, at\nlength, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into\ncombination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided\r\nvortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more\nvast. Suddenly--very suddenly--this assumed a distinct and definite\nexistence, in a circle of more than a mile in diameter. The edge of\nthe whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no\nparticle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose\ninterior, as far as the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining,\r\nand jet-black wall of water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of\nsome forty-five degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with a\nswaying and sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an\nappalling voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty\ncataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.\n\nThe mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw\nmyself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of\nnervous agitation.\n\n\"This,\" said I at length, to the old man--\"this _can_ be nothing else\nthan the great whirlpool of the Maelström.\"\n\n\"So it is sometimes termed,\" said he. \"We Norwegians call it the\nMoskoe-ström, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.\"  The ordinary\naccounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what I\r\nsaw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most circumstantial of\nany, cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence\nor of the horror of the scene--or of the wild bewildering sense of\n_the novel_ which confounds the beholder. I am not sure from what\npoint of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at what time;\nbut it could neither have been from the summit of Helseggen, nor","during a storm. There are some passages of his description,\nnevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although their\neffect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the\nspectacle.\n\n\"Between Lofoden and Moskoe,\" he says, \"the depth of the water is\nbetween thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward\nVer (Vurrgh), this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient\r\npassage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks,\nwhich happens even in the calmest weather. When it is flood, the\nstream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a\nboisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is\nscarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts, the noise\nbeing heard several leagues Off; and the vortices or pits are of such\r\nan extent and depth, that if a ship comes within its attraction, it is\ninevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom, and there beat to\npieces against the rocks; and when the water relaxes, the fragments\nthereof are thrown up again. But these intervals of tranquillity are\nonly at the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last\nbut a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually returning. When the\r\nstream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is\ndangerous to come within a Norway mile of it. Boats, yachts, and ships\nhave been carried away by not guarding against it before they were\nwithin its reach.  It likewise happens frequently that whales come too\nnear the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; and then it is\nimpossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their\r\nfruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once, attempting\nto swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne\ndown, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large\nstocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the current,\nrise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon\nthem. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among","which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by the\nflux and reflux of the sea--it being constantly high and low water\nevery six hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima\nSunday, it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones\nof the houses on the coast fell to the ground.\"\n\nIn regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could\nhave been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the\nvortex. The \"forty fathoms\" must have reference only to portions of\nthe channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden.  The\ndepth in the centre of the Moskoe-ström must be immeasurably greater;\nand no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained\nfrom even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be\r\nhad from the highest crag of Helseggen. Looking down from this\npinnacle upon the howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling\nat the simplicity with which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a\nmatter difficult of belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears;\nfor it appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing that the largest\nships of the line in existence, coming within the influence of that\ndeadly attraction, could resist it as little as a feather the\nhurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.\n\nThe attempts to account for the phenomenon--some of which, I remember,\nseemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal--now wore a very\ndifferent and unsatisfactory aspect.  The idea generally received is\nthat this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Feroe Islands,\r\n\"have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling,\nat flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which\nconfines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and\nthus the higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the\nnatural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction\nof which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.\"--These are the","words of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica.\" Kircher and others imagine\nthat in the centre of the channel of the Maelström is an abyss\npenetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote part--the Gulf\nof Bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance.  This\nopinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed, my\nimagination most readily assented; and, mentioning it to the guide, I\r\nwas rather surprised to hear him say that, although it was the view\nalmost universally entertained of the subject by the Norwegians, it\nnevertheless was not his own. As to the former notion he confessed his\ninability to comprehend it; and here I agreed with him--for, however\nconclusive on paper, it becomes altogether unintelligible, and even\nabsurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.\r\n\"You have had a good look at the whirl now,\" said the old man, \"and if\nyou will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden\nthe roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you\nI ought to know something of the Moskoe-ström.\"\n\nI placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.\n\n\"Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of\nabout seventy tons burden, with which we were in the habit of fishing\r\namong the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent\neddies at sea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one\nhas only the courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden\ncoastmen we three were the only ones who made a regular business of\ngoing out to the islands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great\nway lower down to the southward. There fish can be got at all hours,\r\nwithout much risk, and therefore these places are preferred. The\nchoice spots over here among the rocks, however, not only yield the\nfinest variety, but in far greater abundance; so that we often got in\na single day what the more timid of the craft could not scrape\ntogether in a week.  In fact, we made it a matter of desperate\nspeculation--the risk of life standing instead of labor, and courage\nanswering for capital.","\"We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than\nthis; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of\nthe fifteen minutes' slack to push across the main channel of the\nMoskoe-ström, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage\nsomewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so\nviolent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time for\r\nslack-water again, when we weighed and made for home. We never set out\nupon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and\ncoming--one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return--and\nwe seldom made a miscalculation upon this point. Twice, during six\nyears, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead\ncalm, which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to\r\nremain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a\ngale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too\nboisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should have been\ndriven out to sea in spite of everything (for the whirlpools threw us\nround and round so violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchor\nand dragged it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the\r\ninnumerable cross currents--here to-day and gone to-morrow--which\ndrove us under the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.\n\n\"I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we\nencountered 'on the ground'--it is a bad spot to be in, even in good\nweather--but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the\nMoskoe-ström itself without accident; although at times my heart has","been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or\nbefore the slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought\nit at starting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish,\nwhile the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother\nhad a son eighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my\nown. These would have been of great assistance at such times, in using\nthe sweeps, as well as afterward in fishing--but, somehow, although we\nran the risk ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young ones get\ninto the danger--for, after all said and done, it _was_ a horrible\ndanger, and that is the truth.\n\n\"It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to\ntell you occurred. It was on the tenth of July, 18--, a day which the\r\npeople of this part of the world will never forget--for it was one in\nwhich blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the\nheavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the\nafternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west,\nwhile the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seamen among us could\nnot have forseen what was to follow.\n\n\"The three of us--my two brothers and myself--had crossed over to the\r\nislands about two o'clock P.M., and soon nearly loaded the smack with\nfine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day than we\nhad ever known them. It was just seven, _by my watch,_ when we weighed\nand started for home, so as to make the worst of the Ström at slack\nwater, which we knew would be at eight.\n\n\"We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some\r\ntime spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for\nindeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once we\nwere taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was most\nunusual--something that had never happened to us before--and I began\nto feel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat\non the wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I","was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when,\nlooking astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular\ncopper-colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.\n\n\"In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we\nwere dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state of\nthings, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think\r\nabout it. In less than a minute the storm was upon us--in less than\ntwo the sky was entirely overcast--and what with this and the driving\nspray, it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in\nthe smack.\n\n\"Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. The\noldest seaman in Norway never experienced anything like it. We had let\nour sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the first\r\npuff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed\noff--the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed\nhimself to it for safety.\n\n\"Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon\nwater. It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the\nbow, and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when\nabout to cross the Ström, by way of precaution against the chopping\r\nseas. But for this circumstance we should have foundered at once--for\nwe lay entirely buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped\ndestruction I cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of\nascertaining. For my part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I\nthrew myself flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of\nthe bow, and with my hands grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the\r\nforemast. It was mere instinct that prompted me to do this--which was\nundoubtedly the very best thing I could have done--for I was too much\nflurried to think.\n\n\"For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this\ntime I held my breath, and clung to the bolt.  When I could stand it\nno longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my\nhands, and thus got my head clear. Presently our little boat gave","herself a shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and\nthus rid herself, in some measure, of the seas. I was now trying to\nget the better of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my\nsenses so as to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my\narm. It was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had\nmade sure that he was overboard--but the next moment all this joy was\nturned into horror--for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed\nout the word '_Moskoe-ström_!'\n\n\"No one-will ever know what my feelings were at that moment. I shook\nfrom head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. I\nknew what he meant by that one word well enough--I knew what he wished\nto make me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were\r\nbound for the whirl of the Ström, and nothing could save us!\n\n\"You perceive that in crossing the Ström _channel_, we always went a\nlong way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had\nto wait and watch carefully for the slack--but now we were driving\nright upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this! 'To be\nsure,' I thought, 'we shall get there just about the slack--there is\r\nsome little hope in that--but in the next moment I cursed myself for\nbeing so great a fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well\nthat we were doomed, had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.\n\n\"By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or\nperhaps we did not feel it so much as we scudded before it; but at all\nevents the seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and\r\nlay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular\nchange, too, had come over the heavens. Around in every direction it\nwas still as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all\nat once, a circular rift of clear sky--as clear as I ever saw--and of\na deep bright blue--and through it there blazed forth the full moon\nwith a lustre that I never before knew her to wear. She lit up","everything about us with the greatest distinctness--but, oh God, what\na scene it was to light up!\n\n\"I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother--but, in some\nmanner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I\ncould not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top\nof my voice in his ear.  Presently he shook his head, looking as pale\nas death, and held up one of his fingers, as if to say _listen_!\r\n\"At first I could not make out what he meant--but soon a hideous\nthought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not\ngoing. I glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into\ntears as I flung it far away into the ocean. _It had run down at seven\no'clock! We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the\nStröm was in full fury!_\n\n\"When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the\r\nwaves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip\nfrom beneath her--which appears very strange to a landsman--and this\nis what is called _riding_ in sea phrase.\n\n\"Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but presently a\ngigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter, and bore us\nwith it as it rose--up--up--as if into the sky. I would not have\r\nbelieved that any wave could rise so high. And then down we came with\na sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as\nif I was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream. But while we\nwere up I had thrown a quick glance around--and that one glance was\nall sufficient. I saw our exact position in an instant. The\nMoskoe-ström whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead--but\nno more like the every-day Moskoe-ström, than the whirl as you now see\nit is like a mill-race. If I had not known where we were, and what we\nhad to expect, I should not have recognized the place at all. As it\nwas, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror. The lids clenched\nthemselves together as if in a spasm.\n\n\"It could not have been more than two minutes afterwards until we","suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The boat\nmade a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new\ndirection like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring noise of\nthe water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek--such a\nsound as you might imagine given out by the water-pipes of many\nthousand steam-vessels, letting off their steam all together. We were\r\nnow in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I\nthought, of course, that another moment would plunge us into the\nabyss--down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the\namazing velocity with which we were borne along. The boat did not seem\nto sink into the water at all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the\nsurface of the surge. Her starboard side was next the whirl, and on\r\nthe larboard arose the world of ocean we had left. It stood like a\nhuge writhing wall between us and the horizon.\n\n\"It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the\ngulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching\nit. Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal\nof that terror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was despair\nthat strung my nerves.\r\n\"It may look like boasting--but what I tell you is truth--I began to\nreflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and\nhow foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my\nown individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God's\npower. I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed\nmy mind. After a little while I became possessed with the keenest","curiosity about the whirl itself. I positively felt a _wish_ to\nexplore its depths, even at the sacrifice I was going to make; and my\nprincipal grief was that I should never be able to tell my old\ncompanions on shore about the mysteries I should see. These, no doubt,\nwere singular fancies to occupy a man's mind in such extremity--and I\nhave often thought, since, that the revolutions of the boat around the\npool might have rendered me a little light-headed.\n\n\"There was another circumstance which tended to restore my\nself-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could\nnot reach us in our present situation--for, as you saw yourself, the\nbelt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean,\nand this latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous\r\nridge. If you have never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no\nidea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray\ntogether. They blind, deafen, and strangle you, and take away all\npower of action or reflection.  But we were now, in a great measure,\nrid of these annoyances--just as death-condemned felons in prison are\nallowed petty indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet\nuncertain.\r\n\"How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say. We\ncareered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than\nfloating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the\nsurge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this\ntime I had never let go of the ring-bolt. My brother was at stern,\nholding on to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed\r\nunder the coop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had\nnot been swept overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached\nthe brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the\nring, from which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force\nmy hands, as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure\ngrasp. I never felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this","act--although I new he was a madman when he did it--a raving maniac\nthrough sheer fright. I did not care, however, to contest the point\nwith him. I knew it could make no diference whether either of us held\non at all; so I let him have the bolt, and went astern to the\ncask. This there was no great difficulty in doing; for the smack flew\nround steadily enough, and upon an even keel--only swaying to and fro,\r\nwith the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl.  Scarcely had I\nsecured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to\nstarboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I muttered a hurried\nprayer to God, and thought all was over.\n\n\"As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively\ntightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. For some\nseconds I dared not open them--while I expected instant destruction,\nand wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the\nwater. But moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of\nfalling had ceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had\nbeen before, while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she\nnow lay more along. I took courage and looked once again upon the\nscene.\r\n\"Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration\nwith which I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by\nmagic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in\ncircumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides\nmight have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity\nwith which they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance\r\nthey shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift\namid the clouds, which I have already described, streamed in a flood\nof golden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the\ninmost recesses of the abyss.\n\n\"At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately. The\ngeneral burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld. When I\nrecovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively","downward. In this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view,\nfrom the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the\npool. She was quite upon an even keel--that is to say, her deck lay in\na plane parallel with that of the water--but this latter sloped at an\nangle of more than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying\nupon our beam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I\r\nhad scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in\nthis situation, than if we had been upon a dead level; and this, I\nsuppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved.\n\n\"The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound\ngulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a\nthick mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which\r\nthere hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering\nbridge which Mussulmans say is the only pathway between Time and\nEternity. This mist, or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing\nof the great walls of the funnel, as they all met together at the\nbottom--but the yell that went up to the heavens from out of that\nmist, I dare not attempt to describe.\n\n\"Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above,\r\nhad carried us to a great distance down the slope; but our farther\ndescent was by no means proportionate. Round and round we swept--not\nwith any uniform movement but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent\nus sometimes only a few hundred yards--sometimes nearly the complete\ncircuit of the whirl. Our progress downward, at each revolution, was\nslow, but very perceptible.\r\n\"Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were\nthus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the\nembrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were visible fragments\nof vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with\nmany smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken\nboxes, barrels, and staves. I have already described the unnatural","curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors. It\nappeared to grow upon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful\ndoom. I now began to watch, with a strange interest, the numerous\nthings that floated in our company. I _must_ have been delirious--for\nI even sought _amusement_ in speculating upon the relative velocities\nof their several descents toward the foam below. 'This fir tree,' I\r\nfound myself at one time saying, 'will certainly be the next thing\nthat takes the awful plunge and disappears,'--and then I was\ndisappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship overtook\nit and went down before. At length, after making several guesses of\nthis nature, and being deceived in all--this fact--the fact of my\ninvariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of reflection that made\r\nmy limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily once more.\n\n\"It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a more\nexciting _hope_. This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from\npresent observation. I called to mind the great variety of buoyant\nmatter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and\nthen thrown forth by the Moskoe-ström. By far the greater number of\r\nthe articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way--so chafed\nand roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of\nsplinters--but then I distinctly recollected that there were _some_ of\nthem which were not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for\nthis difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were\nthe only ones which had been _completely absorbed_--that the others\r\nhad entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, from some\nreason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not\nreach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as\nthe case might be. I conceived it possible, in either instance, that\nthey might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without\nundergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early or","absorbed more rapidly. I made, also, three important observations. The\nfirst was, that as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the\nmore rapid their descent; the second, that, between two masses of\nequal extent, the one spherical, and the other _of any other shape,_\nthe superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere; the third,\nthat, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the\r\nother of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly.\nSince my escape, I have had several conversations on this subject with\nan old schoolmaster of the district; and it was from him that I\nlearned the use of the words 'cylinder' and 'sphere.' He explained to\nme--although I have forgotten the explanation--how what I observed\nwas, in fact, the natural consequence of the forms of the floating\r\nfragments, and showed me how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in\na vortex, offered more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in\nwith greater difficulty, than an equally bulky body, of any form\nwhatever.[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: See Archimedes, _De iis Ques in Humido Vehuntur_, lib\nii.]\n\n\"There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in\nenforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to\r\naccount, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed something\nlike a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of\nthese things, which had been on our level when I first opened my eyes\nupon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up above us, and\nseemed to have moved but little from their original station.\n\n\"I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself securely\r\nto the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the\ncounter, and to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my\nbrother's attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that\ncame near us, and did everything in my power to make him understand\nwhat I was about to do. I thought at length that he comprehended my\ndesign--but, whether this was the case or not, he shook his head","despairingly, and refused to move from his station by the ring-bolt.\nIt was impossible to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay;\nand so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened\nmyself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the\ncounter, and precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another\nmoment's hesitation.\n\n\"The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be.  As it is\r\nmyself who now tell you this tale--as you see that I _did_ escape--and\nas you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was\neffected, and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to\nsay--I will bring my story quickly to conclusion. It might have been\nan hour, or thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having\ndescended to a vast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild\r\ngyrations in rapid succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it,\nplunged headlong, at once and forever, into the chaos of foam\nbelow. The barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther\nthan half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at\nwhich I leaped overboard, before a great change took place in the\ncharacter of the whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the vast funnel\r\nbecame momently less and less steep.  The gyrations of the whirl grew,\ngradually, less and less violent.  By degrees, the froth and the\nrainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to\nuprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone down, and the full moon\nwas setting radiantly in the west, when I found myself on the surface\nof the ocean, in full view of the shores of Lofoden, and above the\r\nspot where the pool of the Moskoe-ström _had been._ It was the 20 hour\nof the slack, but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the\neffects of the hurricane. I was borne violently into the channel of\nthe Ström, and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the\n'grounds' of the fishermen. A boat picked me up--exhausted from\nfatigue--and (now that the danger was removed) speechless from the","memory of its horror.  Those who drew me on board were my old mates\nand daily companions, but they knew me no more than they would have\nknown a traveller from the spirit-land. My hair, which had been\nraven-black the day before, was as white as you see it now.  They say\ntoo that the whole expression of my countenance had changed. I told\nthem my story--they did not believe it. I now tell it to you--and I\r\ncan scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry\nfishermen of Lofoden.\"\n\n\n\nTHE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH\n\n\n(NORTHERN ITALY)\n\nThe \"Red Death\" had long devastated the country. No pestilence had\never been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its avatar and its\nseal--the redness and the horror of blood.  There were sharp pains,\nand sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with\r\ndissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body, and especially upon the\nface, of the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid\nand from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure,\nprogress, and termination of the disease were the incidents of half an\nhour.\n\nBut the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When\nhis dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a\r\nthousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and\ndames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of\none of his castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent\nstructure, the creation of the Prince's own eccentric yet august\ntaste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of\niron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy\r\nhammers, and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of\ningress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from\nwithin. The abbey was amply provisioned.  With such precautions the\ncourtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could\ntake care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to\nthink. The Prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There","were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers,\nthere were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and\nsecurity were within. Without was the \"Red Death.\"\n\nIt was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion,\nand while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince\nProspero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most\r\nunusual magnificence.\n\nIt was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of\nthe rooms in which it was held. There were seven--an imperial\nsuite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight\nvista, while the folding-doors slide back nearly to the walls on\neither hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely\nimpeded. Here the case was very different, as might have been expected\r\nfrom the Prince's love of the bizarre. The apartments were so\nirregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one\nat a time.  There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards,\nand at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle\nof each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed\ncorridor which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were\r\nof stained glass, whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing\nhue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at\nthe eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue--and vividly blue\nwere its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and\ntapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was green\nthroughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and\r\nlighted with orange, the fifth with white, the sixth with violet. The\nseventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that\nhung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds\nupon a carpet of the same material and hue. But, in this chamber only,\nthe color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations.\nThe panes here were scarlet--a deep blood-color. Now in no one of the","seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion\nof golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the\nroof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle\nwithin the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the\nsuite there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a\nbrazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and\r\nso glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of\ngaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber\nthe effect of the firelight that streamed upon the dark hangings\nthrough the blood-tinted panes was ghastly in the extreme, and\nproduced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered\nthat there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its\r\nprecincts at all.\n\nIt was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western\nwall a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a\ndull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the\ncircuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from\nthe brazen lungs of the clock a sounct which was clear and loud and\ndeep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiars note and emphasis\nthat, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were\nconstrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to\nthe sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and\nthere was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the\nchimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew\r\npale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows\nas if in confused revery or meditation. But when the echoes had fully\nceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians\nlooked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and\nfolly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next\nchiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and\nthen, after the lapse of sixty minutes (which embrace three thousand\nand six hundred seconds of the Time that flies) there came yet another\nchiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and\ntremulousness and meditation as before.\n\nBut, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The\ntastes of the Prince were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors and","effects. He disregarded the _decora_ of mere fashion. His plans were\nbold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There\nare some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he\nwas not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be _sure_\nthat he was not.\n\nHe had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the\nseven chambers, upon occasion of this great _fête_; and it was his own\r\nguiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure\nthey were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy\nand phantasm--much of what has been since seen in _Hernani_. There\nwere arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There\nwere delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There was much of\nthe beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of\r\nthe terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited\ndisgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a\nmultitude of dreams. And these--the dreams--writhed in and about,\ntaking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra\nto seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony\nclock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment,\r\nall is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The\ndreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die\naway--they have endured but an instant--and a light, half-subdued\nlaughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music\nswells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than\never, taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the","rays from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly\nof the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the\nnight is waning away, and there flows a ruddier light through the\nblood-colored panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appalls;\nand to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from\nthe near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any\nwhich reaches _their_ ears who indulge in the more remote gayeties of\nthe other apartments.\n\nBut these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat\nfeverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until\nat length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And\nthen the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the\r\nwaltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things\nas before. But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell\nof the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought\ncrept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among\nthose who revelled. And thus too it happened, perhaps, that before the\nlast echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there\r\nwere many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become\naware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the\nattention of no single individual before. And the rumor of this new\npresence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at\nlength from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of\ndisapprobation and surprise--then, finally, of terror, of horror, and\r\nof disgust.\n\nIn an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be\nsupposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such\nsensation. In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly\nunlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone\nbeyond the bounds of even the Prince's indefinite decorum. There are\nchords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched","without emotion.  Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death\nare equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made. The\nwhole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume\nand bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The\nfigure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the\nhabiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made\r\nso nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the\nclosest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And\nyet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad\nrevellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type\nof the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in _blood_--and his broad\nbrow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the\r\nscarlet horror.\n\nWhen the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which\nwith a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its\n_role_, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be\nconvulsed, in the first moment, with a strong shudder either of terror\nor distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.\n\n\"Who dares?\" he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near\r\nhim--\"who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and\nunmask him--that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the\nbattlements!\"\n\nIt was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince\nProspero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven\nrooms loudly and clearly--for the Prince was a bold and robust man,\nand the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.\r\nIt was in the blue room where stood the Prince, with a group of pale\ncourtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight\nrushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who\nat the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and\nstately step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain\nnameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired","the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize\nhim; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the Prince's\nperson; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank\nfrom the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way\nuninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had\ndistinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the\npurple--through the purple to the green--through the green to the\norange--through this again to the white--and even thence to the\nviolet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was\nthen, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the\nshame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six\nchambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that\r\nhad seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached,\nin rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating\nfigure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet\napartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a\nsharp cry--and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet,\nupon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince\r\nProspero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the\nrevellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and,\nseizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless\nwithin the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at\nfinding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled\nwith so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.\r\nAnd now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death.  He had come\nlike a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the\nblood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing\nposture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with\nthat of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired.\nAnd Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion\nover all.","THE GOLD BUG\n\n  What ho! what ho! this fellow is dancing mad!\n  He hath been bitten by the Tarantula.\n                               _All in the Wrong_\n\n\nMany years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr.  William Legrand.\nHe was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a\nseries of misfortunes had reduced him to want.  To avoid the\nmortification consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the\r\ncity of his fore-fathers, and took up his residence at Sullivan's\nIsland, near Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nThis island is a very singular one.  It consists of little else than\nthe sea sand, and is about three miles long.  Its breadth at no point\nexceeds a quarter of a mile. It is separated from the mainland by a\nscarcely perceptible creek, oozing its way through a wilderness of\nreeds and slime, a favorite resort of the marsh-hen. The vegetation,\nas might be supposed, is scant, or at least dwarfish. No trees of any\nmagnitude are to be seen. Near the western extremity, where Fort\nMoultrie stands, and where are some miserable frame buildings,\ntenanted during summer by the fugitives from Charleston dust and\nfever, may be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto; but the whole\r\nisland, with the exception of this western point, and a line of hard\nwhite beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense undergrowth of\nthe sweet myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists of England.\nThe shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and\nforms an almost impenetrable coppice, burdening the air with its\nfragrance.\n\nIn the utmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern or\r\nmore remote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a small hut,\nwhich he occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his\nacquaintance. This soon ripened into, friendship--for there was much\nin the recluse to excite interest and esteem. I found him well\neducated, with unusual powers of mind, but infected with misanthropy,\nand subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy.","He had with him many books, but rarely employed them.  His chief\namusements were gunning and fishing, or sauntering along the beach and\nthrough the myrtles in quest of shells or entomological\nspecimens;--his collection of the latter might have been envied by a\nSwammerdamm. In these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old\nnegro, called Jupiter, who had been manumitted before the reverses of\nthe family, but who could be induced, neither by threats nor by\npromises, to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon\nthe footsteps of his young \"Massa Will.\" It is not improbable that the\nrelatives of Legrand, conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in\nintellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a\nview to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.\r\nThe winters in the latitude of Sullivan's Island are seldom very\nsevere, and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a\nfire is considered necessary. About the middle of October, 18--, there\noccurred, however, a day of remarkable chilliness. Just before sunset\nI scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend,\nwhom I had not visited for several weeks--my residence being at that\r\ntime in Charleston, a distance of nine miles from the island, while\nthe facilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of\nthe present day. Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom,\nand, getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was\nsecreted, unlocked the door and went in. A fine fire was blazing upon\nthe hearth. It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one. I","threw off an overcoat, took an armchair by the crackling logs, and\nawaited patiently the arrival of my hosts.\n\nSoon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial\nwelcome. Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare\nsome marsh-hens for supper. Legrand was in one of his fits--how else\nshall I term them?--of enthusiasm. He had found an unknown bivalve,\nforming a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and\nsecured, with Jupiter's assistance, a _scarabæus_ which he believed to\nbe totally new, but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion\non the morrow.\n\n\"And why not to-night?\" I asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and\nwishing the whole tribe of _scarabæi_ at the devil.\n\n\"Ah, if I had only known you were here!\" said Legrand, \"but it's so\r\nlong since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would pay me a\nvisit this very night of all others?  As I was coming home I met\nLieutenant G----, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the\nbug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until the\nmorning. Stay here to-night, and I will send Jup down for it at\nsunrise. It is the loveliest thing in creation!\"\n\n\"What?--sunrise?\"\r\n\"Nonsense! no!--the bug. It is of a brilliant gold color--about the\nsize of a large hickory-nut--with two jet black spots near one\nextremity of the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other. The\n_antennæ_ are--\"\n\n\"Dey aint _no_ tin in him, Massa Will, I keep a tellin on you,\" here\ninterrupted Jupiter; \"de bug is a goole-bug, solid, ebery bit of him,\ninside and all, sep him wing--neber-feel half so hebby a bug in my\r\nlife.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose it is, Jup,\" replied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly,\nit seemed to me, than the case demanded, \"is that any reason for your\nletting the birds burn? The color\"--here he turned to me--\"is really\nalmost enough to warrant Jupiter's idea. You never saw a more\nbrilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit--but of this you cannot\njudge till to-morrow. In the meantime I can give you some idea of the\nshape.\" Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were\na pen and ink, but no paper. He looked for some in a drawer, but found\nnone.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said he at length, \"this will answer;\" and he drew from\nhis waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty foolscap,\nand made upon it a rough drawing with the pen.  While he did this, I","retained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly.  When the design\nwas complete, he handed it to me without rising.  As I received it, a\nlow growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door. Jupiter\nopened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in,\nleaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown\nhim much attention during previous visits.  When his gambols were\r\nover, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not\na little puzzled at what my friend had depicted.\n\n\"Well!\" I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, \"this _is_ a\nstrange _scarabæus_, I must confess; new to me: never saw anything\nlike it before--unless it was a skull, or a death's-head, which it\nmore nearly resembles than anything else that has come under _my_\nobservation.\"\r\n\"A death's-head!\"  echoed Legrand--\"oh--yes--well, it has something of\nthat appearance upon paper, no doubt.  The two upper black spots look\nlike eyes, eh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth--and then\nthe shape of the whole is oval.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" said I; \"but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. I must\nwait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its\npersonal appearance.\"\r\n\"We'll, I don't know,\" said he, a little nettled, \"I draw\ntolerably--_should_ do it at least--have had good masters, and flatter\nmyself that I am not quite a blockhead.\"\n\n\"But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,\" said I; \"this is a very\npassable _skull_,--indeed, I may say that it is a very _excellent_\nskull, according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of\nphysiology--and your _scarabæus_ must be the queerest _scarabæus_\r\nin the world if it resembles it. Why, we may get up a very thrilling\nbit of superstition upon this hint.  I presume you will call the bug\n_scarabæus caput hominis_, or something of that kind--there are\nmany similar titles in the Natural Histories.  But where are the\n_antennae_ you spoke of?\"  \"The _antennae_!\" said Legrand, who seemed\nto be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject; \"I am sure you must","see the _antennae_. I made them as distinct as they are in the\noriginal insect, and I presume that is sufficient.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" I said, \"perhaps you have--still I don't see them;\" and\nI handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing to\nruffle his temper, but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had\ntaken; his ill humor puzzled me--and as for the drawing of the\nbeetle, there were positively _no antennae_ visible, and the whole\r\n_did_ bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a\ndeath's-head.\n\nHe received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it,\napparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design\nseemed suddenly to rivet his attention.  In an instant his face grew\nviolently red--in another as excessively pale.  For some minutes he\ncontinued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat.  At length\r\nhe arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself\nupon a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room. Here again he\nmade an anxious examination of the paper; turning it in all\ndirections. He said nothing, however, and his conduct greatly\nastonished me; yet I thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing\nmoodiness of his temper by any comment. Presently he took from his\r\ncoat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully in it, and deposited\nboth in a writing-desk, which he locked. He now grew more composed in\nhis demeanor; but his original air of enthusiasm had quite\ndisappeared. Yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted.  As the\nevening wore away he became more and more absorbed in revery, from\nwhich no sallies of mine could arouse him. It had been my intention to\npass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before, but,\nseeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave. He did\nnot press me to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with even\nmore than his usual cordiality.\n\nIt was about a month after this (and during the interval I had seen\nnothing of Legrand) when I received a visit, at Charleston, from his","man, Jupiter. I had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited,\nand I feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend.\n\n\"Well, Jup,\" said I, \"what is the matter now?--how is your master?\"\n\n\"Why, to speak de troof, massa, him not so berry well as mought be.\"\n\n\"Not well! I am truly sorry to hear it. What does he complain of?\"\n\n\"Dar! dat's it!--him neber plain of notin--but him berry sick for all\ndat.\"\r\n\"_Very_ sick, Jupiter!--why didn't you say so at once? Is he confined\nto bed?\"\n\n\"No, dat he aint!--he aint find nowhar--dat's just whar de shoe\npinch--my mind is got to be berry hebby bout poor Massa Will.\"\n\n\"Jupiter, I should like to understand what it is you are talking\nabout.  You say your master is sick.  Hasn't he told you what ails\nhim?\"\n\n\"Why, massa, taint worf while for to git mad bout de matter--Massa\r\nWill say noffin at all aint de matter wid him--but den what make him\ngo about looking dis here way, wid he head down and he soldiers up,\nand as white as a gose?  And den he keep a syphon all de time--\"\n\n\"Keeps a what, Jupiter?\"\n\n\"Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de slate--de queerest figgurs I\nebber did see. Ise gittin to be skeered, I tell you.  Hab for to keep\nmighty tight eye pon him noovers. Todder day he gib me slip fore de\r\nsun up and was gone de whole ob de blessed day. I had a big stick\nready cut for to gib him d------d good beating when he did come--but\nIse sich a fool dat I hadn't de heart arter all--he look so berry\npoorly.\"\n\n\"Eh?--what?--ah yes!--upon the whole I think you had better not be too\nsevere with the poor fellow--don't flog him, Jupiter--he can't very\nwell stand it--but can you form no idea of what has occasioned this","illness, or rather this change of conduct? Has anything unpleasant\nhappened since I saw you?\"\n\n\"No, massa, dey aint bin noffin onpleasant _since_ den--it 'twas\n_fore_ den I'm feared--'twas de berry day you was dare.\"\n\n\"How? what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, massa, I mean de bug--dare now.\"\n\n\"The what?\"\n\n\"De bug--I'm berry sartin dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere bout de\nhead by dat goole-bug.\"\n\n\"And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such a supposition?\"\n\n\"Claws enuff, massa, and mouff too.  I nebber did see sich a d------d\nbug--he kick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him.  Massa Will\ncotch him fuss, but had for to let him go gin mighty quick, I tell\nyou--den was de time he must ha got de bite. I didn't like de look ob\nde bug mouff, myself, no how, so I wouldn't take hold ob him wid my\r\nfinger, but I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found. I rap him up\nin de paper and stuff piece of it in he mouff--dat was de way.\"\n\n\"And you think, then, that your master was really bitten by the\nbeetle, and that the bite made him sick?\"\n\n\"I don't tink noffin about it--I nose it. What make him dream bout de\ngoole so much, if taint cause he bit by de goole-bug? Ise heerd bout\ndem goole-bugs fore dis.\"\n\n\"But how do you know he dreams about gold?\"\n\n\"How I know? why, cause he talk about it in he sleep--dat's how I\nnose.\"\n\n\"Well, Jup, perhaps you are right; but to what fortunate circumstance\nam I to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?\"\n\n\"What de matter, massa?\"\n\n\"Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand?\"\n\n\"No, massa, I bring dis here pissel;\" and here Jupiter handed me a\r\nnote which ran thus:\n\n\n\"MY DEAR ----, Why have I not seen you for so long a time?  I hope you\nhave not been so foolish as to take offence at any little _brusquerie_\nof mine; but no, that is improbable.\n\n\"Since I saw you I have had great cause for anxiety. I have something\nto tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell it, or whether I should\ntell it at all.\n\n\"I have not been quite well for some days past, and poor old Jup\nannoys me, almost beyond endurance, by his well-meant attentions.\nWould you believe it?--he had prepared a huge stick, the other day,\nwith which to chastise me for giving him the slip, and spending the\nday, _solus_, among the hills on the mainland. I verily believe that\nmy ill looks alone saved me a flogging.\n\n\"I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.","\"If you can, in any way, make it convenient, come over with Jupiter.\n_Do_ come. I wish to see you _to-night_, upon business of importance.\nI assure you that it is of the _highest_ importance.\n\n\"Ever yours,\n\"WILLIAM LEGRAND.\"\n\n\nThere was something in the tone of this note which gave me great\nuneasiness. Its whole style differed materially from that of Legrand.\nWhat could he be dreaming of? What new crotchet possessed his\r\nexcitable brain? What \"business of the highest importance\" could _he_\npossibly have to transact?  Jupiter's account of him boded no good. I\ndreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had, at length,\nfairly unsettled the reason of my friend. Without a moment's\nhesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the negro.\n\nUpon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all\r\napparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to\nembark.\n\n\"What is the meaning of all this, Jup?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Him syfe, massa, and spade.\"\n\n\"Very true; but what are they doing here?\n\n\"Him de syfe and de spade what Massa Will sis pon my buying for him in\nde town, and de debbil's own lot of money I had to gib for em.\"\n\n\"But what, in the name of all that is mysterious, is your 'Massa Will'\r\ngoing to do with scythes and spades?\"\n\n\"Dat's more dan _I_ know, and debbil take me if I don't blieve 'tis\nmore dan he know, too. But it's all cum ob de bug.\"\n\nFinding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of Jupiter, whose\nwhole intellect seemed to be absorbed by \"de bug,\" I now stepped into\nthe boat and made sail. With a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into\nthe little cove to the northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some\r\ntwo miles brought us to the hut. It was about three in the afternoon\nwhen we arrived.  Legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation.\nHe grasped my hand with a nervous _empressement_, which alarmed me and\nstrengthened the suspicions already entertained. His countenance was\npale even to ghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural\nlustre. After some inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not","knowing what better to say, if he had yet obtained the _scarabæus_\nfrom Lieutenant G----.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he replied, coloring violently, \"I got it from him the next\nmorning.  Nothing should tempt me to part with that _scarabæus_. Do\nyou know that Jupiter is quite right about it?\"\n\n\"In what way?\" I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart.\n\n\"In supposing it to be a bug of _real gold_.\" He said this with an air\r\nof profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked.\n\n\"This bug is to make my fortune,\" he continued, with a triumphant\nsmile, \"to reinstate me in my family possessions.  Is it any wonder,\nthen, that I prize it? Since Fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon\nme, I have only to use it properly and I shall arrive at the gold of\nwhich it is the index. Jupiter, bring me that _scarabæus_!\"\r\n\"What! de bug, massa? I'd rudder not go fer trubble dat bug--you mus\ngit him for your own self.\" Hereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and\nstately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it\nwas enclosed. It was a beautiful _scarabæus_, and, at that time,\nunknown to naturalists--of course a great prize in a scientific point\nof view. There were two round, black spots near one extremity of the\r\nback, and a long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard\nand glossy, with all the appearance of burnished gold. The weight of\nthe insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things into\nconsideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting\nit; but what to make of Legrand's agreement with that opinion, I could\nnot, for the life of me, tell.\n\n\"I sent for you,\" said he, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had\r\ncompleted my examination of the beetle, \"I sent for you that I might\nhave your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of Fate and\nof the bug--\"\n\n\"My dear Legrand,\" I cried, interrupting him, \"you are certainly\nunwell, and had better use some little precautions.  You shall go to\nbed, and I will remain with you a few days, until you get over\nthis. You are feverish and--\"","\"Feel my pulse,\" said he.\n\nI felt it, and, to say the truth, found not the slightest indication\nof fever.\n\n\"But you may be ill, and yet have no fever. Allow me this once to\nprescribe for you. In the first place, go to bed. In the next--\"\n\n\"You are mistaken,\" he interposed, \"I am as well as I can expect to be\nunder the excitement which I suffer. If you really wish me well, you\nwill relieve this excitement.\"\r\n\"And how is this to be done?\"\n\n\"Very easily. Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the\nhills, upon the mainland, and, in this expedition, we shall need the\naid of some person in whom we can confide. You are the only one we can\ntrust. Whether we succeed or fail, the excitement which you now\nperceive in me will be equally allayed.\"\n\n\"I am anxious to oblige you in any way,\" I replied; \"but do you mean\r\nto say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your\nexpedition into the hills?\"\n\n\"It has.\"\n\n\"Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such absurd proceeding.\"\n\n\"I am sorry--very sorry--for we shall have to try it by ourselves.\"\n\n\"Try it by yourselves! The man is surely mad!--but stay--how long do\nyou propose to be absent?\"\n\n\"Probably all night. We shall start immediately, and be back, at all\nevents, by sunrise.\"\n\n\"And will you promise me, upon your honor, that when this freak of\nyours is over, and the bug business (good God!)  settled to your\nsatisfaction, you will then return home and follow my advice\nimplicitly, as that of your physician?\"\n\n\"Yes; I promise; and now let us be off, for we have no time to lose.\"\n\nWith a heavy heart I accompanied my friend. We started about four\r\no'clock--Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, and myself.  Jupiter had with him\nthe scythe and spades--the whole of which he insisted upon carrying,\nmore through fear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the\nimplements within reach of his master, than from any excess of\nindustry or complaisance His demeanor was dogged in the extreme, and\n\"dat d----d bug\" were the sole words which escaped his lips during the","journey. For my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns,\nwhile Legrand contented himself with the _scarabæus,_ which he\ncarried attached to the end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and\nfro, with the air of a conjurer, as he went. When I observed this\nlast, plain evidence of my friend's aberation of mind, I could\nscarcely refrain from tears. I thought it best, however, to humor his\r\nfancy, at least for the present, or until I could adopt some more\nenergetic measures with a chance of success. In the meantime I\nendeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in regard to the object of\nthe expedition.  Having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him, he\nseemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor\nimportance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than \"we\r\nshall see!\"\n\nWe crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff,\nand, ascending the high grounds on the shore of the mainland,\nproceeded in a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country\nexcessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a human footstep was\nto be seen. Legrand led the way with decision; pausing only for an\ninstant, here and there, to consult what appeared to be certain\r\nlandmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion.\n\nIn this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun was just\nsetting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet\nseen. It was a species of tableland, near the summit of an almost\ninaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, and\ninterspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the\r\nsoil, and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves\ninto the valleys below merely by the support of the trees against\nwhich they reclined.  Deep ravines, in various directions, gave an air\nof still sterner solemnity to the scene.\n\nThe natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown\nwith brambles, through which we soon discovered that it would have\nbeen impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by","direction of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot\nof an enormously tall tulip tree, which stood, with some eight or ten\noaks, upon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees\nwhich I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in\nthe wide spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its\nappearance. When we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and\r\nasked him if he thought he could climb it. The old man seemed a little\nstaggered by the question, and for some moments made no reply. At\nlength he approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and\nexamined it with minute attention. When he had completed his scrutiny,\nhe merely said:\n\n\"Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life.\"\n\n\"Then up with you as soon as possible, for it will soon be too dark to\r\nsee what we are about.\"\n\n\"How far mus go up, massa?\" inquired Jupiter.\n\n\"Get up the main trunk first, and then I will tell you which way to\ngo--and here--stop! take this beetle with you.\"\n\n\"De bug, Massa Will!--de goole-bug!\" cried the negro, drawing back in\ndismay--\"what for mus tote de bug way up de tree?--d--n if I do!\"\n\n\"If you are afraid, Jup, a great big negro like you, to take hold of a\nharmless little dead beetle, why, you can carry it up by this\nstring--but, if you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall be\nunder the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel.\"\n\n\"What de matter now, massa?\" said Jup, evidently shamed into\ncompliance; \"always want fur to raise fuss wid old nigger.  Was only\nfunnin anyhow. _Me_ feered de bug! what I keer for de bug?\" Here he","took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string, and,\nmaintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would\npermit, prepared to ascend the tree.\n\nIn youth, the tulip tree, or _Liriodendron Tulipifera_, the most\nmagnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and\noften rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its\nriper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs\nmake their appearance on the stem. Thus the difficulty of ascension,\nin the present case, lay more in semblance than in reality. Embracing\nthe huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms and knees,\nseizing with his hands some projections, and resting his naked toes\nupon others, Jupiter, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at\r\nlength wriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to\nconsider the whole business as virtually accomplished. The _risk_ of\nthe achievement was, in fact, now over, although the climber was some\nsixty or seventy feet from the ground.\n\n\"Which way mus go now, Massa Will?\" he asked.\n\n\"Keep up the largest branch,--the one on this side,\" said Legrand. The\nnegro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little trouble,\r\nascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his squat figure\ncould be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it.\nPresently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo.\n\n\"How much fudder is got for go?\"\n\n\"How high up are you?\" asked Legrand.\n\n\"Ebber so fur,\" replied the negro; \"can see de sky fru de top ob de\ntree.\"\n\n\"Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say. Look down the trunk and\r\ncount the limbs below you on this side. How many limbs have you\npassed?\"\n\n\"One, two, tree, four, fibe--I done pass fibe big limb, massa, pon dis\nside.\"\n\n\"Then go one limb higher.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the\nseventh limb was attained.\n\n\"Now, Jup,\" cried Legrand, evidently much excited, \"I want you to work\nyour way out upon that limb as far as you can. If you see anything","strange, let me know.\"\n\nBy this time what little doubt I might have entertained of my poor\nfriend's insanity was put finally at rest. I had no alternative but to\nconclude him stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious\nabout getting him home. While I was pondering upon what was best to be\ndone, Jupiter's voice was again heard.\n\n\"Mos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry far--'tis dead limb putty\r\nmuch all de way.\"\n\n\"Did you say it was a _dead_ limb, Jupiter?\" cried Legrand in a\nquavering voice.\n\n\"Yes, massa, him dead as de door-nail--done up for sartain--done\ndeparted dis here life.\"\n\n\"What in the name of heaven shall I do?\" asked Legrand, seemingly in\nthe greatest distress.\n\n\"Do!\" said I, glad of an opportunity to interpose a word, \"why come\nhome and go to bed. Come now!--that's a fine fellow. It's getting\r\nlate, and, besides, you remember your promise.\"\n\n\"Jupiter,\" cried he, without heeding me in the least, \"do you hear\nme?\"\n\n\"Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.\"\n\n\"Try the wood well, then, with your knife, and see if you think it\n_very_ rotten.\"\n\n\"Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,\" replied the negro in a few moments,\n\"but not so berry rotten as mought be. Mought ventur out leetle way\r\npon de limb by myself, dat's true.\"\n\n\"By yourself?--what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, I mean de bug. 'Tis _berry_ hebby bug. Spose I drop him down\nfuss, and den de limb won't break wid just de weight ob one nigger.\"\n\n\"You infernal scoundrel!\" cried Legrand, apparently much relieved,\n\"what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that? As sure as you\nlet that beetle fall, I'll break your neck.  Look here, Jupiter! do\r\nyou hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes, massa, needn't hollo at poor nigger dat style.\"\n\n\"Well! now listen!--if you will venture out on the limb as far as you\nthink safe, and not let go the beetle, I'll make you a present of a\nsilver dollar as soon as you get down.\"\n\n\"I'm gwine, Massa Will--deed I is,\" replied the negro very\npromptly--\"mos out to the eend now.\"\n\n\"_Out to the end!_\" here fairly screamed Legrand, \"do you say you are","out to the end of that limb?\"\n\n\"Soon be to de eend, massa,--o-o-o-o-oh! Lor-gol-a-marcy!  what _is_\ndis here pon de tree?\"\n\n\"Well!\" cried Legrand, highly delighted, \"what is it?\"\n\n\"Why taint noffin but a skull--somebody bin lef him head up de tree,\nand de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off.\"\n\n\"A skull, you say!--very well!--how is it fastened to the limb?--what\nholds it on?\"\n\n\"Sure nuff, massa; mus look. Why, dis berry curous sarcumstance, pon\nmy word--dare's a great big nail in de skull, what fastens ob it on to\nde tree.\"\n\n\"Well now, Jupiter, do exactly as I tell you--do you hear?\"\n\n\"Yes, massa.\"\n\n\"Pay attention, then!--find the left eye of the skull.\"\n\n\"Hum! hoo! dat 's good! why, dar ain't no eye lef at all.\"\n\n\"Curse your stupidity! do you know your right hand from your left?\"\r\nYes, I nose dat--nose all bout dat--'tis my lef hand what I chops de\nwood wid.\"\n\n\"To be sure! you are left-handed; and your left eye is on the same\nside as your left hand. Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye of\nthe skull, or the place where the left eye has been. Have you found\nit?\"\n\nHere was a long pause. At length the negro asked, \"Is de lef eye of de\nskull pon de same side as de lef hand of de skull, too?--cause de\r\nskull ain't got not a bit ob a hand at all--nebber mind! I got de lef\neye now--here de lef eye! what mus do wid it?\"\n\n\"Let the beetle drop through it, as far as the string will reach--but\nbe careful and not let go your hold of the string.\"\n\n\"All dat done, Massa Will; mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de\nhole--look out for him dar below!\"\n\nDuring this colloquy no portion of Jupiter's person could be seen; but","the beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now visible at the\nend of the string, and glistened like a globe of burnished gold in the\nlast rays of the setting sun, some of which still faintly illumined\nthe eminence upon which we stood. The _scarabæus_ hung quite clear of\nany branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fallen at our\nfeet. Legrand immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a\ncircular space, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the\ninsect, and, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the\nstring and come down from the tree.\n\nDriving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground at the precise spot\nwhere the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his pocket a\ntape-measure. Fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk of\r\nthe tree which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it till it reached the\npeg, and thence farther unrolled it, in the direction already\nestablished by the two points of the tree and the peg, for the\ndistance of fifty feet--Jupiter clearing away the brambles with the\nscythe. At the spot thus attained a second peg was driven, and about\nthis, as a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter,\r\ndescribed. Taking now a spade himself, and giving one to Jupiter and\none to me, Legrand begged us to set about digging as quickly as\npossible.\n\nTo speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement at any\ntime, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly have\ndeclined it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued\nwith the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of escape, and was\r\nfearful of disturbing my poor friend's equanimity by a refusal. Could\nI have depended, indeed, upon Jupiter's aid, I would have had no\nhesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force; but I was\ntoo well assured of the old negro's disposition to hope that he would\nassist me, under any circumstances, in a personal contest with his\nmaster. I made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of","the innumerable Southern superstitions about money buried, and that\nhis fantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the\n_scarabæus_, or, perhaps, by Jupiter's obstinacy in maintaining it to\nbe \"a bug of real gold.\"  A mind disposed to lunacy would readily be\nled away by such suggestions, especially if chiming in with favorite\npreconceived ideas; and then I called to mind the poor fellow's speech\r\nabout the beetle's being \"the index of his fortune.\" Upon the whole, I\nwas sadly vexed and puzzled, but at length I concluded to make a\nvirtue of necessity--to dig with a good will, and thus the sooner to\nconvince the visionary, by ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the\nopinions he entertained.\n\nThe lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a\nmore rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our persons and\nimplements, I could not help thinking how picturesque a group we\ncomposed, and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared\nto any interloper who, by chance, might have stumbled upon our\nwhereabouts.\n\nWe dug very steadily for two hours. Little was said; and our chief\nembarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding\r\ninterest in our proceedings. He, at length, became so obstreperous\nthat we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the\nvicinity; or, rather, this was the apprehension of Legrand; for\nmyself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have\nenabled me to get the wanderer home. The noise was, at length, very\neffectually silenced by Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a\r\ndogged air of deliberation, tied the brute's mouth up with one of his\nsuspenders, and then returned, with a grave chuckle, to his task.\n\nWhen the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of five\nfeet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest. A general\npause ensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an end.\nLegrand, however, although evidently much disconcerted, wiped his brow","thoughtfully and recommenced. We had excavated the entire circle of\nfour feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went\nto the farther depth of two feet. Still nothing appeared. The\ngold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied, at length clambered from the\npit, with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature,\nand proceeded, slowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he\r\nhad thrown off at the beginning of his labor. In the meantime I made\nno remark. Jupiter, at a signal from his master, began to gather up\nhis tools. This done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned in\nprofound silence towards home.\n\nWe had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when, with a\nloud oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar.\nThe astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent,\r\nlet fall the spades, and fell upon his knees.\n\n\"You scoundrel,\" said Legrand, hissing out the syllables from between\nhis clenched teeth--\"you infernal black villain!--speak, I tell\nyou!--answer me this instant, without prevarication!--which--which is\nyour left eye?\"\n\n\"Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?\"\nroared the terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his _right_ organ\nof vision, and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in\nimmediate dread of his master's attempt at a gouge.\n\n\"I thought so! I knew it! Hurrah!\" vociferated Legrand, letting the\nnegro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracoles, much to the\nastonishment of his valet, who, arising from his knees, looked mutely\nfrom his master to myself, and then from myself to his master.\r\n\"Come! we must go back,\" said the latter, \"the game's not up yet;\" and\nhe again led the way to the tulip tree.\n\n\"Jupiter,\" said he, when we reached its foot, \"come here!  Was the\nskull nailed to the limb with the face outward, or with the face to\nthe limb?\"\n\n\"De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes good,\nwidout any trouble.\"\n\n\"Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the","beetle?\" here Legrand touched each of Jupiter's eyes.\n\n\"'Twas dis eye, massa--de lef eye--jis as you tell me,\" and here it\nwas his right eye that the negro indicated.\n\n\"That will do--we must try it again.\"\n\nHere my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I saw,\ncertain indications of method, removed the peg which marked the spot\nwhere the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the westward of\r\nits former position. Taking, now, the tape-measure from the nearest\npoint of the trunk to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension\nin a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was\nindicated, removed, by several yards, from the point at which we had\nbeen digging.\n\nAround the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former\ninstance, was now described, and we again set to work with the spades.\r\nI was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what had\noccasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great\naversion from the labor imposed. I had become most unaccountably\ninterested--nay, even excited. Perhaps there was something, amid all\nthe extravagant demeanor of Legrand--some air of forethought, or of\ndeliberation--which impressed me. I dug eagerly, and now and then\r\ncaught myself actually looking, with something that very much\nresembled expectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision of which\nhad demented my unfortunate companion. At a period when such vagaries\nof thought most fully possessed me, and when we had been at work\nperhaps an hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the violent\nhowlings of the dog. His uneasiness, in the first instance, had been\r\nevidently but the result of playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed\na bitter and serious tone. Upon Jupiter's again attempting to muzzle\nhim, he made furious resistance, and, leaping into the hole, tore up\nthe mould frantically with his claws. In a few seconds he had\nuncovered a mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons,\nintermingled with several buttons of metal, and what appeared to be","the dust of decayed woollen. One or two strokes of a spade upturned\nthe blade of a large Spanish knife, and, as he dug farther, three or\nfour loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light.\n\nAt sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but\nthe countenance of his master wore an air of extreme\ndisappointment. He urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and\r\nthe words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and fell forward, having\ncaught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried\nin the loose earth.\n\nWe now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more\nintense excitement. During this interval we had fairly unearthed an\noblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation and\nwonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing\r\nprocess--perhaps that of the bichloride of mercury. This box was three\nfeet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet\ndeep. It was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and\nforming a kind of trellis-work over the whole. On each side of the\nchest, near the top, were three rings of iron--six in all--by means of\nwhich a firm hold could be obtained by six persons.  Our utmost united\r\nendeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its\nbed. We at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight.\nLuckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding\nbolts. These we drew back--trembling and panting with anxiety. In an\ninstant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us. As\nthe rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards,\r\nfrom a confused heap of gold and of jewels, a glow and a glare that\nabsolutely dazzled our eyes.\n\nI shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I\ngazed. Amazement was, of course, predominant. Legrand appeared\nexhausted with excitement, and spoke very few words. Jupiter's\ncountenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is\npossible, in the nature of things, for any negro's visage to assume.","He seemed stupified--thunder-stricken. Presently he fell upon his\nknees in the pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the elbows in\ngold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath. At\nlength, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy:\n\n\"And dis all cum ob de goole-bug! de putty goole-bug!  de poor little\ngoole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style! Aint you shamed\r\nob yourself, nigger?--answer me dat!\"\n\nIt became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and\nvalet to the expediency of removing the treasure. It was growing late,\nand it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get everything\nhoused before daylight. It was difficult to say what should be done,\nand much time was spent in deliberation--so confused were the ideas of\nall. We finally lightened the box by removing two-thirds of its\r\ncontents, when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from\nthe hole. The articles taken out were deposited among the brambles,\nand the dog left to guard them, with strict orders from Jupiter\nneither, upon any pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his\nmouth until our return. We then hurriedly made for home with the\nchest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive toil, at one\r\no'clock in the morning. Worn out as we were, it was not in human\nnature to do more just now. We rested until two, and had supper;\nstarting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed with three stout\nsacks, which by good luck were upon the premises. A little before four\nwe arrived at the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as equally\nas might be, among us, and, leaving the holes unfilled, again set out\nfor the hut, at which, for the second time, we deposited our golden\nburdens, just as the first streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the\ntree-tops in the East.\n\nWe were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the\ntime denied us repose. After an unquiet slumber of some three or four\nhours' duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of","our treasure.\n\nThe chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and\nthe greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents.\nThere had been nothing like order or arrangement.  Everything had been\nheaped in promiscuously. Having assorted all with care, we found\nourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first\nsupposed. In coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty\r\nthousand dollars: estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as\nwe could, by the tables of the period. There was not a particle of\nsilver. All was gold of antique date and of great variety: French,\nSpanish, and German money, with a few English guineas, and some\ncounters, of which we had never seen specimens before. There were\nseveral very large and heavy coins, so worn that we could make nothing\r\nof their inscriptions. There was no American money.  The value of the\njewels we found more difficulty in estimating.  There were\ndiamonds--some of them exceedingly large and fine--a hundred and ten\nin all, and not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable\nbrilliancy; three hundred and ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and\ntwenty-one sapphires, with an opal. These stones had all been broken\r\nfrom their settings and thrown loose in the chest. The settings\nthemselves, which we picked out from among the other gold, appeared to\nhave been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent identification.\nBesides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments:\nnearly two hundred massive finger and ear-rings; rich chains--thirty\nof these, if I remember; eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes;\r\nfive gold censers of great value; a prodigious golden punch-bowl,\nornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures;\nwith two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other smaller\narticles which I cannot recollect. The weight of these valuables\nexceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and in this\nestimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold","watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars, if\none. Many of them were very old, and as time-keepers valueless, the\nworks having suffered more or less from corrosion; but all were richly\njewelled and in cases of great worth. We estimated the entire contents\nof the chest, that night, at a million and a half of dollars; and,\nupon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being\r\nretained for our own use), it was found that we had greatly\nundervalued the treasure.\n\n\nWhen, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense\nexcitement of the time had in some measure subsided, Legrand, who saw\nthat I was dying with impatience for a solution of this most\nextraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the\ncircumstances connected with it.\n\n\"You remember,\" said he, \"the night when I handed you the rough sketch\nI had made of the _scarabæus_. You recollect, also, that I became\nquite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a\ndeath's-head. When you first made this assertion I thought you were\njesting; but afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots on the\nback of the insect, and admitted to myself that your remark had some\r\nlittle foundation in fact. Still, the sneer at my graphic powers\nirritated me--for I am considered a good artist--and, therefore, when\nyou handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about to crumple it up and\nthrow it angrily into the fire.\"\n\n\"The scrap of paper, you mean,\" said I.\n\n\"No: it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed\nit to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at\r\nonce, to be a piece of very thin parchment.  It was quite dirty, you\nremember. Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance\nfell upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may\nimagine my astonishment when I perceived, in, fact, the figure of a\ndeath's-head just where, it seemed to me, I had made the drawing of\nthe beetle. For a moment I was too much amazed to think with accuracy.","I knew that my design was very different in detail from this--although\nthere was a certain similarity in general outline.  Presently I took a\ncandle and, seating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to\nscrutinize the parchment more closely. Upon turning it over, I saw my\nown sketch upon the reverse, just as I had made it. My first idea,\nnow, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of\r\noutline--at the singular coincidence involved in the fact that,\nunknown to me, there should have been a skull upon the other side of\nthe parchment, immediately beneath my figure of the _scarabæus_, and\nthat this skull, not only in outline, but in size, should so closely\nresemble my drawing. I say the singularity of this coincidence\nabsolutely stupified me for a time. This is the usual effect of such\r\ncoincidences. The mind struggles to establish a connection--a sequence\nof cause and effect--and, being unable to do so, suffers a species of\ntemporary paralysis. But, when I recovered from this stupor, there\ndawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more\nthan the coincidence.  I began distinctly, positively, to remember\nthat there had been _no_ drawing on the parchment when I made my\r\nsketch of the _scarabæus_. I became perfectly certain of this; for I\nrecollected turning up first one side and then the other, in search of\nthe cleanest spot. Had the skull been then there, of course I could\nnot have failed to notice it. Here was indeed a mystery which I felt\nit impossible to explain; but, even at that early moment, there seemed\nto glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and secret chambers of my","intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that truth which last\nnight's adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration. I arose\nat once, and, putting the parchment securely away, dismissed all\nfarther reflection until I should be alone.\n\n\"When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself\nto a more methodical investigation of the affair. In the first place I\nconsidered the manner in which the parchment had come into my\npossession. The spot where we discovered the _scarabæus_ was on the\ncoast of the mainland, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a\nshort distance above high-water mark. Upon my taking hold of it, it\ngave me a sharp bite, which caused me to let it drop. Jupiter, with\nhis accustomed caution, before seizing the insect, which had flown\r\ntowards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something of that nature,\nby which to take hold of it. It was at this moment that his eyes, and\nmine also, fell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed to\nbe paper. It was lying half-buried in the sand, a corner sticking\nup. Near the spot where we found it, I observed the remnants of the\nhull of what appeared to have been a ship's long boat. The wreck\nseemed to have been there for a very great while; for the resemblance\nto boat timbers could scarcely be traced.\n\n\"Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and\ngave it to me. Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way\nmet Lieutenant G----.  I showed him the insect, and he begged me to\nlet him take it to the fort. On my consenting, he thrust it forthwith\r\ninto his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been\nwrapped, and which I had continued to hold in my hand during his\ninspection.  Perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it\nbest to make sure of the prize at once--you know how enthusiastic he\nis on all subjects connected with Natural History. At the same time,\nwithout being conscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment in","my own pocket.\n\n\"You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making\na sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept. I\nlooked in the drawer, and found none there. I searched my pockets,\nhoping to find an old letter, and then my hand fell upon the\nparchment. I thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my\npossession; for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.\r\n\"No doubt you will think me fanciful--but I had already established a\nkind of _connection_. I had put together two links of a great chain.\nThere was a boat lying on a seacoast, and not far from the boat was a\nparchment--_not a paper_--with a skull depicted on it. You will, of\ncourse, ask 'where is the connection?' I reply that the skull, or\ndeath's-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate. The flag of the\ndeath's-head is hoisted in all engagements.\n\n\"I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper.  Parchment\nis durable--almost imperishable. Matters of little moment are rarely\nconsigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of\ndrawing or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper. This\nreflection suggested some meaning--some relevancy--in the deaths-head.\r\nI did not fail to observe, also, the _form_ of the parchment. Although\none of its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be\nseen that the original form was oblong. It was just such a slip,\nindeed, as might have been chosen for a memorandum--for a record of\nsomething to be long remembered and carefully preserved.\"\n\n\"But,\" I interposed, \"you say that the skull, was _not_ upon the\r\nparchment when you made the drawing of the beetle.  How then do you\ntrace any connection between the boat and the skull--since this\nlatter, according to your own admission, must have been designed (God\nonly knows how or by whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching\nthe _scarabæus_?\"\n\n\"Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this\npoint, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving. My steps were","sure, and could afford but a single result. I reasoned, for example,\nthus: When I drew the _scarabæus,_ there was no skull apparent on the\nparchment. When I had completed the drawing I gave it to you, and\nobserved you narrowly until you returned it. _You_, therefore, did not\ndesign the skull, and no one else was present to do it. Then it was\nnot done by human agency. And nevertheless it was done.\r\n\"At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and _did_\nremember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred\nabout the period in question. The weather was chilly (O rare and happy\naccident!), and a fire was blazing on the hearth. I was heated with\nexercise and sat near the table. You, however, had drawn a chair close\nto the chimney.  Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as\r\nyou were in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered,\nand leaped upon your shoulders. With your left hand you caressed him\nand kept him off, while your right, holding the parchment, was\npermitted, to fall listlessly between your knees, and in close\nproximity to the fire. At one moment I thought the blaze had caught\nit, and was about to caution you, but, before I could speak, you had\r\nwithdrawn it, and were engaged in its examination. When I considered\nall these particulars, I doubted not for a moment that _heat_ had been\nthe agent in bringing to light, on the parchment, the skull which I\nsaw designed on it. You are well aware that chemical preparations\nexist, and have existed time out of mind, by means of which it is\npossible to write on either paper or vellum, so that the characters\r\nshall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire.\nZaffre, digested in _aqua regia_, and diluted with four times its\nweight of water, is sometimes employed; a green tint results. The\nregulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red. These\ncolors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material\nwritten upon cools, but again become apparent upon the re-application\nof heat.","\"I now scrutinized the death's-head with care. Its outer edges--the\nedges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum--were far more\n_distinct_ than the others. It was clear that the action of the\ncaloric had been imperfect or unequal.  I immediately kindled a fire,\nand subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat. At\nfirst, the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the\r\nskull; but, on persevering in the experiment, there became visible at\nthe corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the\ndeath's-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to\nbe a goat. A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was\nintended for a kid.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" said I, \"to be sure I have no right to laugh at you--a\nmillion and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth--but you\r\nare not about to establish a third link in your chain: you will not\nfind any especial connection between your pirates and a goat; pirates,\nyou know, have nothing to do with goats; they appertain to the farming\ninterest.\"\n\n\"But I have just said that the figure was _not_ that of a goat.\"\n\n\"Well, a kid, then--pretty much the same thing.\"\n\n\"Pretty much, but not altogether,\" said Legrand. \"You may have heard\r\nof one _Captain_ Kidd. I at once looked on the figure of the animal as\na kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature. I say signature,\nbecause its position on the vellum suggested this idea. The\ndeath's-head at the corner diagonally opposite had, in the same\nmanner, the air of a stamp, or seal.  But I was sorely put out by the\nabsence of all else--of the body to my imagined instrument--of the\ntext for my context.\"\r\n\"I presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the\nsignature.\"\n\n\"Something of that kind. The fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed\nwith a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending. I can\nscarcely say why. Perhaps, after all, it was rather a desire than an\nactual belief;--but do you know that Jupiter's silly words, about the\nbug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect on my fancy? And then","the series of accidents and coincidences--these were so _very_\nextraordinary.  Do you observe how mere an accident it was that these\nevents should have occurred on the _sole_ day of all the year in which\nit has been, or may be, sufficiently cool for fire, and that without\nthe fire, or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment\nin which he appeared, I should never have become aware of the\ndeath's-head, and so never the possessor of the treasure?\"\n\n\"But proceed--I am all impatience.\"\n\n\"Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current--the\nthousand vague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere on the\nAtlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates.  These rumors must have\nhad some foundation in fact. And that the rumors have existed so long\r\nand so continuously, could have resulted, it appeared to me, only from\nthe circumstance of the buried treasure still _remaining_ entombed.\nHad Kidd concealed his plunder for a time, and afterwards reclaimed\nit, the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present\nunvarying form. You will observe that the stories told are all about\nmoney-seekers, not about money-finders.  Had the pirate recovered his\r\nmoney, there the affair would have dropped. It seemed to me that some\naccident--say the loss of a memorandum indicating its locality--had\ndeprived him of the means of recovering it, and that this accident had\nbecome known to his followers, who otherwise might never have heard\nthat treasure had been concealed at all, and who, busying themselves\nin vain, because unguided, attempts to regain it, had given first\r\nbirth, and then universal currency, to the reports which are now so\ncommon. Have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed\nalong the coast?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"But that Kidd's accumulations were immense is well known. I took it\nfor granted, therefore, that the earth still held them; and you will\nscarcely be surprised when I tell you that I felt a hope, nearly\namounting to certainty, that the parchment so strangely found involved\na lost record of the place of deposit.\"\n\n\"But how did you proceed?\"\n\n\"I held the vellum again to the fire, after increasing the heat, but\nnothing appeared. I now thought it possible that the coating of dirt\nmight have something to do with the failure; so I carefully rinsed the\nparchment by pouring warm water over it, and, having done this, I","placed it in a tin pan, with the skull downwards, and put the pan upon\na furnace of lighted charcoal. In a few minutes, the pan having become\nthoroughly heated, I removed the slip, and, to my inexpressible joy,\nfound it spotted, in several places, with what appeared to be figures\narranged in lines. Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered it to\nremain another minute. Upon taking it off, the whole was just as you\r\nsee it now.\"\n\nHere Legrand, having reheated the parchment, submitted it to my\ninspection. The following characters were rudely traced, in a red\ntint, between the death's-head and the goat:--\n\n53‡‡†305))6*;4826)4‡.)4‡);806*;48†8¶60))85;;]8*;:‡*8†83(8\n8)5*†;46(;88*96*?;8)*‡(;485);5*†2:*‡(;4956*2(5*--4)8¶8*;4069\n285);)6†8)4‡‡;1(‡9;48081;8:8‡1;48†85;4)485†528806*81(‡9;48;(8\n8;4(‡?34;48)4‡;161;:188;‡?;\r\n\"But,\" said I, returning him the slip, \"I am as much in the dark as\never. Were all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me on my solution of\nthis enigma, I am quite sure, that I should be unable to earn them.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Legrand, \"the solution is by no means so difficult as\nyou might be led to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the\ncharacters. These characters, as any one might readily guess, form a\r\ncipher--that is to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what is\nknown of Kidd, I could not suppose, him capable of constructing any of\nthe more abstruse cryptographs. I made up my mind, at once, that this\nwas of a simple species--such, however, as would appear, to the crude\nintellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble without the key.\"\n\n\"And you really solved it?\"\n\n\"Readily; I have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times\r\ngreater. Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led me to\ntake interest in such riddles, and it may well be doubted whether\nhuman ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human\ningenuity may not, by proper application, resolve. In fact, having\nonce established connected and legible characters, I scarcely gave a\nthought to the mere difficulty of developing their import.","\"In the present case--indeed in all cases of secret writing--the first\nquestion regards the _language_ of the cipher; for the principles of\nsolution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers are\nconcerned, depend on, and are varied by, the genius of the particular\nidiom. In general, there is no alternative but experiment (directed by\nprobabilities) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution,\r\nuntil the true one be attained. But, with the cipher now before us,\nall difficulty is removed by the signature. The pun upon the word\n'Kidd' is appreciable in no other language than the English. But for\nthis consideration I should have begun my attempts with the Spanish\nand French, as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most\nnaturally have been written by a pirate of the Spanish main. As it\nwas, I assumed the cryptograph to be English.\n\n\"You observe there are no divisions between the words.  Had there been\ndivisions, the task would have been comparatively easy.  In such case\nI should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter\nwords, and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as is most likely\n(_a_ or _I_, for example), I should have considered the solution as\r\nassured.  But, there being no division, my first step was to ascertain\nthe predominant letters, as well as the least frequent.  Counting all,\nI constructed a table, thus:\n\nOf the character  8 there are 33\n                  ;    \"     26\n                  4    \"     19\n                  ‡)   \"     16\n                  *    \"     13\n                  5    \"     12\n                  6    \"     11\r\n†1    \"      8\n                  0    \"      6\n                 92    \"      5\n                 :3    \"      4\n                  ?    \"      3\n                  ¶    \"      2\n                  ]    \"      1\n\n\"Now, in English, the letter which most frequently occurs is _e_.\nAfterwards the succession runs thus: _a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m\nw b k p q x z. E_ predominates, however, so remarkably that an","individual sentence of any length is rarely seen, in which it is not\nthe prevailing character.\n\n\"Here, then, we have, in the very beginning, the groundwork for\nsomething more than a mere guess. The general use which may be made of\nthe table is obvious--but, in this particular cipher, we shall only\nvery partially require its aid. As our predominant character is 8, we\nwill commence by assuming it as the _e_ of the natural alphabet. To\r\nverify the supposition, let us observe if the 8 be seen often in\ncouples--for _e_ is doubled with great frequency in English--in such\nwords, for example, as 'meet,' 'fleet,' 'speed,' 'seen,' 'been,'\n'agree,' etc. In the present instance we see it doubled no less than\nfive times, although the cryptograph is brief.\n\n\"Let us assume 8, then, as _e_. Now, of all _words_ in the language,\r\n'the' is most usual; let us see, therefore, whether there are not\nrepetitions of any three characters, in the same order of collocation,\nthe last of them being 8. If we discover repetitions of such letters,\nso arranged, they will most probably represent the word 'the.' On\ninspection, we find no less than seven such arrangements, the\ncharacters being ;48. We may, therefore, assume that the semicolon\r\nrepresents _t_, that 4 represents _h_, and that 8 represents _e_--the\nlast being now well confirmed. Thus a great step has been taken.\n\n\"But, having established a single word, we are enabled to establish a\nvastly important point; that is to say, several commencements and\nterminations of other words. Let us refer, for example, to the last\ninstance but one, in which combination ;48 occurs--not far from the\r\nend of the cipher.  We know that the semicolon immediately ensuing is\nthe commencement of a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this\n'the,' we are cognizant of no less than five. Let us set these\ncharacters down, thus, by the letters we know them to represent,\nleaving a space for the unknown--\n\n  t eeth\n\n\"Here we are enabled, at once, to discard the '_th_,' as forming no","portion of the word commencing with the first _t_; since, by\nexperiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy,\nwe perceive that no word can be formed of which this _th_ can be a\npart. We are thus narrowed into\n\n  t ee,\n\nand, going through the alphabet, if necessary, as before, we arrive at\nthe word 'tree' as the sole possible reading. We thus gain another\nletter _r_, represented by (, with the words 'the tree' in\r\njuxtaposition.\n\n\"Looking beyond these words, for a short distance, we again see the\ncombination ;48, and employ it by way of _termination_ to what\nimmediately precedes. We have thus this arrangement:\n\n  the tree ;4(‡?34 the,\n\nor, substituting the natural letters, where known, it reads thus:\n\n  the tree thr‡?3h the.\n\n\"Now, if, in place of the unknown characters, we leave blank spaces,\nor substitute dots, we read thus:\r\nthe tree thr . . . h the,\n\nwhen the word '_through_' makes itself evident at once. But this\ndiscovery gives us three new letters, _o, u_, and _g_, represented by\n‡ ? and 3.\n\n\"Looking now, narrowly, through the cipher for combinations of known\ncharacters, we find, not very far from the beginning, this\narrangement,\n\n  83(88, or egree,\n\nwhich, plainly, is the conclusion of the word 'degree,' and gives us\r\nanother letter, _d_, represented by †.\n\n\"Four letters beyond the word 'degree,' we perceive the combination\n\n  ;46(;88*\n\n\"Translating the known characters, and representing the unknown by\ndots, as before, we read thus:\n\n  th . rtee,\n\nan arrangement immediately suggestive of the word 'thirteen,' and\nagain furnishing us with two new characters, _i_ and _n_, represented\nby 6 and *.\r\n\"Referring, now, to the beginning of the cryptograph, we find the\ncombination,\n\n  53‡‡†,\n\n\"Translating as before, we obtain\n\n  good,\n\nwhich assures us that the first letter is _A_, and that the first two\nwords are 'A good.'\n\n\"To avoid confusion, it is now time that we arrange our key, as far as\ndiscovered, in a tabular form. It will stand thus:\n\n5  represents a\n†      \"      d\n8      \"      e\n3      \"      g\n4      \"      h","6      \"      i\n*      \"      n\n‡      \"      o\n(      \"      r\n;      \"      t\n\n\"We have, therefore, no less than ten of the most important letters\nrepresented, and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details of\nthe solution. I have said enough to convince you that ciphers of this\nnature are readily soluble, and to give you some insight into the\nrationale of their development. But be assured that the specimen\r\nbefore us appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph. It\nnow only remains to give you the full translation of the characters\nupon the parchment, 5 as unriddled. Here it is:\n\n\"'_A good glass in the bishop's hostel in the devil's seat twenty-one\ndegrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch\nseventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the death's-head a\r\nbee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out_.'\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as\never. How is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon\nabout 'devil's seats,' 'death's-heads,' and 'bishop's hotels'?\"\n\n\"I confess,\" replied Legrand, \"that the matter still wears a serious\naspect, when regarded with a casual glance. My first endeavor was to\ndivide the sentence into the natural division intended by the\ncryptographist.\"\n\n\"You mean, to punctuate it?\"\n\n\"Something of that kind.\"\n\n\"But how was it possible to effect this?\"\n\n\"I reflected that it had been a _point_ with the writer to run his\nwords together without division, so as to increase the difficulty of\nsolution.  Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing such an object,\r\nwould be nearly certain to overdo the matter.  When, in the course of\nhis composition, he arrived at a break in his subject which would\nnaturally require a pause, or a point, he would be exceedingly apt to\nrun his characters, at this place, more than usually close\ntogether. If you will observe the MS., in the present instance, you\nwill easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding. Acting on this","hint, I made the division thus:\n\n\"'_A good glass in the bishop's hostel in the devil's seat--twenty-one\ndegrees and thirteen minutes--northeast and by north--main branch\nseventh limb east side--shoot from the left eye of the deaths-head--a\n\nbee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out_.'\"\n\n\"Even this division,\" said I, \"leaves me still in the dark.\"\n\n\"It left me also in the dark,\" replied Legrand, \"for a few days;\r\nduring which I made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of\nSullivan's Island, for any building which went by the name of the\n'Bishop's Hotel'; for, of course, I dropped the obsolete word\n'hostel.' Gaining no information on the subject, I was on the point of\nextending my sphere of search, and proceeding in a more systematic\nmanner, when one morning it entered into my head, quite suddenly, that\r\nthis 'Bishop's Hostel' might have some reference to an old family, of\nthe name of Bessop, which, time out of mind, had held possession of an\nancient manor-house, about four miles to the northward of the\nisland. I accordingly went over to the plantation, and reinstituted my\ninquiries among the older negroes of the place. At length one of the\nmost aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as\r\n_Bessop's Castle_, and thought that she could guide me to it, but that\nit was not a castle, nor a tavern, but a high rock.\n\n\"I offered to pay her well for her trouble, and, after some demur, she\nconsented to accompany me to the spot. We found it without much\ndifficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded to examine the place.\nThe 'castle' consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and\nrocks--one of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well\nas for its insulated and artificial appearance. I clambered to its\napex, and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done.\n\n\"While I was busied in reflection, my eyes fell on a narrow ledge in\nthe eastern face of the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit upon\nwhich I stood. This ledge projected about eighteen inches, and was not","more than a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just above it gave\nit a rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our\nancestors. I made no doubt that here was the 'devil's seat' alluded to\nin the MS., and now I seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle.\n\n\"The 'good glass,' I knew, could have reference to nothing but a\ntelescope; for the word 'glass' is rarely employed in any other sense\r\nby seamen. Now here, I at once saw, was a telescope to be used, and a\ndefinite point of view, _admitting no variation_, from which to use\nit. Nor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, 'twenty-one\ndegrees and thirteen minutes,' and 'northeast and by north,' were\nintended as directions for the levelling of the glass. Greatly excited\nby these discoveries, I hurried home, procured a telescope, and\nreturned to the rock.\r\n\"I let myself down to the ledge, and found that it was impossible to\nretain a seat on it unless in one particular position.  This fact\nconfirmed my preconceived idea. I proceeded to use the glass. Of\ncourse, the 'twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes' could allude to\nnothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal\ndirection was clearly indicated by the words, 'northeast and by\r\nnorth.' This latter direction I at once established by means of a\npocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of\ntwenty-one degrees of elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it\ncautiously up or down, until my attention was arrested by a circular\nrift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that over-topped its\nfellows in the distance. In the centre of this rift I perceived a\r\nwhite spot, but could not, at first, distinguish what it was.\nAdjusting the focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now made it\nout to be a human skull.\n\n\"On this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved;\nfor the phrase 'main branch, seventh limb, east side,' could refer\nonly to the position of the skull on the tree, while 'shoot from the\nleft eye of the death's-head' admitted, also, of but one","interpretation, in regard to a search for buried treasure. I perceived\nthat the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull,\nand that a bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line, drawn from\nthe nearest point of the trunk through 'the shot' (or the spot where\nthe bullet fell), and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet,\nwould indicate a definite point--and beneath this point I thought it\r\nat least _possible_ that a deposit of value lay concealed.\"\n\n\"All this,\" I said, \"is exceedingly clear, and, although ingenious,\nstill simple and explicit. When you left the Bishop's Hotel, what\nthen?\"\n\n\"Why, having carefully taken the bearings of the tree, I turned\nhomewards. The instant that I left 'the devil's seat,' however, the\ncircular rift vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of it afterwards,\r\nturn as I would. What seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole\nbusiness, is the fact (for repeated experiment has convinced me it\n_is_ a fact) that the circular opening in question is visible from no\nother attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge\non the face of the rock.\n\n\"In this expedition to the 'Bishop's Hotel' I had been attended by\nJupiter, who had no doubt observed, for some weeks past, the\r\nabstraction of my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave me\nalone. But on the next day, getting up very early, I contrived to give\nhim the slip, and went into the hills in search of the tree. After\nmuch toil I found it.  When I came home at night my valet proposed to\ngive me a flogging. With the rest of the adventure I believe you are\nas well acquainted as myself.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said I, \"you missed the spot, in the first attempt at\ndigging, through Jupiter's stupidity in letting the bug fall through\nthe right instead of through the left eye of the skull.\"\n\n\"Precisely. This mistake made a difference of about two inches and a\nhalf in the 'shot'--that is to say, in the position of the peg nearest\nthe tree; and had the treasure been _beneath_ the 'shot,' the error","would have been of little moment; but 'the shot,' together with the\nnearest point of the tree, were merely two points for the\nestablishment of a line of direction; of course the error, however\ntrivial in the beginning, increased as we proceeded with the line,\nand, by the time we had gone fifty feet, threw us quite off the\nscent. But for my deep-seated convictions that treasure was here\r\nsomewhere actually buried, we might have had all our labor in vain.\"\n\n\"I presume the fancy of _the skull_--of letting fall a bullet through\nthe skull's eye--was suggested to Kidd by the piratical flag. No doubt\nhe felt a kind of poetical consistency in recovering his money through\nthis ominous insignium.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so; still, I cannot help thinking that common sense had quite\nas much to do with the matter as poetical consistency. To be visible\r\nfrom the devil's seat, it was necessary that the object, if small,\nshould be _white_; and there is nothing like your human skull for\nretaining and even increasing its whiteness under exposure to all\nvicissitudes of weather.\"\n\n\"But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the beetle--how\nexcessively odd! I was sure you were mad.  And why did you insist on\nletting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull?\"\r\n\"Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions\ntouching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own\nway, by a little bit of sober mystification.  For this reason I swung\nthe beetle, and for this reason I let it fall from the tree. An\nobservation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter\nidea.\"\n\n\"Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles","me. What are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole?\"\n\n\"That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself.  There\nseems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for them--and yet\nit is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would\nimply. It is clear that Kidd--if Kidd indeed secreted this treasure,\nwhich I doubt not--it is clear 30 that he must have had assistance in\nthe labor. But, the worst of this labor concluded, he may have thought\nit expedient to remove all participants in his secret. Perhaps a\ncouple of blows with a mattock were sufficient, while his coadjutors\nwere busy in the pit; perhaps it required a dozen--who shall tell?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PURLOINED LETTER\n\n  Nil sapientiæ odiosius acumine nimio.\n                               SENECA\r\nAt Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18--, I\nwas enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in\ncompany with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library,\nor book closet, _au troisième_, No. 33, Rue Dunôt, Faubourg St.\nGermain. For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence;\nwhile each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and\r\nexclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed\nthe atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally\ndiscussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation\nbetween us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of\nthe Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogêt. I\nlooked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the\r\ndoor of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old\nacquaintance, Monsieur G----, the Prefect of the Parisian police.\n\nWe gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the\nentertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen\nhim for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now\narose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without","doing so, upon G----'s saying that he had called to consult us, or\nrather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business\nwhich had occasioned a great deal of trouble.\n\n\"If it is any point requiring reflection,\" observed Dupin, as he\nforebore to enkindle the wick, \"we shall examine it to better purpose\nin the dark.\"\n\n\"That is another of your odd notions,\" said the Prefect, who had a\r\nfashion of calling everything \"odd\" that was beyond his comprehension,\nand thus lived amid an absolute legion of \"oddities.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and\nrolled towards him a comfortable chair.\n\n\"And what is the difficulty now?\" I asked. \"Nothing more in the\nassassination way, I hope?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is _very_\r\nsimple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently\nwell ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the\ndetails of it, because it is so excessively _odd_.\"\n\n\"Simple and odd,\" said Dupin.\n\n\"Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all been\na good deal puzzled because the affair _is_ so simple, and yet baffles\nus altogether.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at\r\nfault,\" said my friend.\n\n\"What nonsense you _do_ talk!\" replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.\n\n\"Perhaps the mystery is a little _too_ plain,\" said Dupin.\n\n\"Oh, good Heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?\"\n\n\"A little _too_ self-evident.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!--ha! ha! ha!--ho! ho! ho!\" roared our visitor, profoundly\namused. \"O Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!\"\n\n\"And what, after all, _is_ the matter on hand?\" I asked.\r\n\"Why, I will tell you,\" replied the Prefect, as he gave a long,\nsteady, and contemplative puff, and settle'd himself in his chair.  \"I\nwill tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you\nthat this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I\nshould most probably lose the position I now hold were it known that I\nconfided it to any one.\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said I.\n\n\"Or not,\" said Dupin.","\"Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high\nquarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been\npurloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it\nis known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known,\nalso, that it still remains in his possession.\"\n\n\"How is this known?\" asked Dupin.\n\n\"It is clearly inferred,\" replied the Prefect, \"from the nature of the\r\ndocument, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would\nat once arise from its passing _out_ of the robber's possession; that\nis to say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to\nemploy it.\"\n\n\"Be a little more explicit,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder\na certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely\r\nvaluable.\"  The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.\n\n\"Still I do not quite understand,\" said Dupin.\n\n\"No?  well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who\nshall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of\nmost exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document\nan ascendency over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are\nso jeopardized.\"\n\n\"But this ascendency,\" I interposed, \"would depend upon the robber's\nknowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber.  Who would dare--\"\n\n\"The thief,\" said G-------, \"is the Minister D------, who dares all\nthings, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man.  The method\nof the theft was not less ingenious than bold.  The document in\nquestion--a letter, to be frank--had been received by the\r\npersonage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir.  During its perusal\nshe was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted\npersonage, from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.  After\na hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced\nto place it, open as it was, upon a table. The address, however, was\nuppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped","notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D----. His lynx eye\nimmediately perceives the paper, recognizes the handwriting of the\naddress, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and\nfathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through\nin his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the\none in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in\r\nclose juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses for some fifteen\nminutes upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes\nalso from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful\nowner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the\npresence of the third personage, who stood at her elbow. The Minister\ndecamped, leaving his own letter--one of no importance--upon the\ntable.\"\n\n\"Here, then,\" said Dupin to me, \"you have precisely what you demand to\nmake the ascendancy complete--the robber's knowledge of the loser's\nknowledge of the robber.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Prefect; \"and the power thus attained has, for some\nmonths past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous\nextent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day,\r\nof the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot\nbe done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the\nmatter to me.\"\n\n\"Than whom,\" said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, \"no more\nsagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.\"\n\n\"You flatter me,\" replied the Prefect; \"but it is possible that some\nsuch opinion may have been entertained.\"\r\n\"It is clear,\" said I, \"as you observe, that the letter is still in\npossession of the Minister; since it is this possession, and not any\nemployment of the letter, which bestows the power.  With the\nemployment the power departs.\"\n\n\"True,\" said G----; \"and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first\ncare was to make thorough search of the Minister's Hotel; and here my\nchief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his","knowledge. Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which\nwould result from giving him reason to suspect our design.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"you are quite _au fait_ in these investigations. The\nParisian police have done this thing often before.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the\nMinister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from\nhome all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a\ndistance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly\nNeapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with\nwhich I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a\nnight has not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been\nengaged, personally, in ransacking the D---- Hotel. My honor is\r\ninterested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So\nI did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied the\nthief is a more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have\ninvestigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is\npossible that the paper can be concealed.\"\n\n\"But is it not possible,\" I suggested, \"that although the letter may\nbe in possession of the Minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have\r\nconcealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?\"\n\n\"This is barely possible,\" said Dupin. \"The present peculiar condition\nof affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D----\nis known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the\ndocument--its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice--a\npoint of nearly equal importance with its possession.\"\r\n\"Its susceptibility of being produced?\" said I.\n\n\"That is to say, of being _destroyed_,\" said Dupin.\n\n\"True,\" I observed; \"the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As\nfor its being upon the person of the Minister, we may consider that as\nout of the question.\"\n\n\"Entirely,\" said the Prefect. \"He has been twice waylaid, as if by\nfootpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.\"","\"You might have spared yourself this trouble,\" said Dupin.  \"D----, I\npresume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated\nthese waylayings, as a matter of course.\"\n\n\"Not _altogether_ a fool,\" said G----, \"but then he's a poet, which I\ntake to be only one remove from a fool.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his\nmeerschaum, \"although I have been guilty of certain doggerel myself.\"\r\n\"Suppose you detail,\" said I, \"the particulars of your search.\"\n\n\"Why, the fact is, we took our time, and we searched _everywhere_. I\nhave had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building,\nroom by room, devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We\nexamined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every\npossible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained\r\npolice agent, such a thing as a _secret_ drawer is impossible. Any man\nis a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of\nthis kind. The thing is _so_ plain. There is a certain amount of\nbulk--of space--to be accounted for in every cabinet.  Then we have\naccurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After\nthe cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine\r\nlong needles you have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the\ntops.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of\nfurniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article;\nthen the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity,\nand the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in\nthe same way.\"\r\n\"But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?\" I asked.\n\n\"By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding\nof cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case we were obliged to\nproceed without noise.\"\n\n\"But you could not have removed--you could not have taken to pieces\n_all_ articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to\nmake a deposit in the manner you mention.  A letter may be compressed","into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a\nlarge knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the\nrung of a chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the\nchairs?\"\n\n\"Certainly not; but we did better--we examined the rungs of every\nchair in the Hotel, and indeed, the jointings of every description of\nfurniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been\r\nany traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect\nit instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have\nbeen as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the gluing--any unusual\ngaping in the joints--would have sufficed to insure detection.\"\n\n\"I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the\nplates, and you probed the beds and the bedclothes, as well as the\r\ncurtains and carpets?\"\n\n\"That, of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle\nof the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We\ndivided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so\nthat none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square\ninch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately\nadjoining, with the microscope, as before.\"\r\n\"The two houses adjoining!\" I exclaimed; \"you must have had a great\ndeal of trouble.\"\n\n\"We had; but the reward offered is prodigious.\"\n\n\"You include the _grounds_ about the houses?\"\n\n\"All the grounds are paved with bricks. They gave us comparatively\nlittle trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it\nundisturbed.\"\n\n\"You looked among D----'s papers, of course, and into the books of the","library?\"\n\n\"Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened\nevery book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not\ncontenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of\nsome of our police officers. We also measured the thickness of every\nbook-_cover_, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to\neach the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the\nbindings been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly\nimpossible that the fact should have escaped observation. Some five or\nsix volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed,\nlongitudinally, with the needles.\"\n\n\"You explored the floors beneath the carpets?\"\n\n\"Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with\nthe microscope.\"\r\n\"And the paper on the walls?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You looked into the cellars?\"\n\n\"We did.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I said, \"you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter\nis _not_ upon the premises, as you suppose.\"\n\n\"I fear you are right there,\" said the Prefect. \"And now, Dupin, what\nwould you advise me to do?\"\n\n\"To make a thorough re-search of the premises.\"\n\n\"That is absolutely needless,\" replied G----. \"I am not more sure that\nI breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.\"\n\n\"I have no better advice to give you,\" said Dupin.\n\n\"You have, of course, an accurate description of the letter?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\"--And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book,\nproceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and\nespecially of the external appearance of the missing document. Soon\r\nafter finishing the perusal of this description, he took his\ndeparture, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known\nthe good gentleman before.\n\nIn about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us\noccupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered\ninto some ordinary conversation. At length I said,--\n\n\"Well, but, G----, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at","last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the\nMinister?\"\n\n\"Confound him, say I--yes; I made the re-examination, however, as\nDupin suggested--but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.\"\n\n\"How much was the reward offered, did you say?\" asked Dupin.\n\n\"Why, a very great deal--a _very_ liberal reward--I don't like to say\nhow much, precisely; but one thing I _will_ say, that I wouldn't mind\r\ngiving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who\ncould obtain me that letter.  The fact is, it is becoming of more and\nmore importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If\nit were trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his\nmeerschaum, \"I really--think, G----, you have not exerted yourself--to\r\nthe utmost in this matter. You might--do a little more, I think, eh?\"\n\n\"How?--in what way?\"\n\n\"Why--puff, puff--you might--puff, puff--employ counsel in the matter,\neh?--puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell of\nAbernethy?\"\n\n\"No; hang Abernethy!\"\n\n\"To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain\nrich miser conceived the design of sponging upon this Abernethy for a\r\nmedical opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary\nconversation in a private company, he insinuated his case to the\nphysician, as that of an imaginary individual.\n\n\"'We will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such and\nsuch; now, doctor, what would _you_ have directed him to take?'\n\n\"'Take!' said Abernethy, 'why, take _advice_, to be sure.'\"\n\n\"But,\" said the Prefect, a little discomposed, \"I am _perfectly_\r\nwilling to take advice, and to pay for it. I would _really_ give fifty\nthousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a\ncheck-book, \"you may as well fill me up a check for the amount\nmentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.\"\n\nI was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken. For","some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking\nincredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed\nstarting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in\nsome measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant\nstares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand\nfrancs, and handed it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined\r\nit carefully and deposited it in his pocketbook; then, unlocking an\n_escritoire_, took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This\nfunctionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a\ntrembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then,\nscrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length\nunceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having\nuttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.\r\nWhen he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.\n\n\"The Parisian police,\" he said, \"are exceedingly able in their\nway. They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed\nin the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when\nG---- detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel\nD----, I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory\ninvestigation--so far as his labors extended.\"\n\n\"So far as his labors extended?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dupin. \"The measures adopted were not only the best of\ntheir kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter\nbeen deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would,\nbeyond a question, have found it.\"\n\nI merely laughed--but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.\r\n\"The measures, then,\" he continued, \"were good in their kind, and well\nexecuted; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case,\nand to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with\nthe Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed to which he forcibly adapts his\ndesigns. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for\nthe matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than","he. I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in\nthe game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game\n_is_ simple, and is played with marbles.  One player holds in his hand\na number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is\neven or odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he\nloses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the\r\nschool. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in\nmere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his\nopponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and,\nholding up his closed hand asks, 'Are they even or odd?' Our schoolboy\nreplies, 'Odd' and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he\nthen says to himself, 'the simpleton had them even upon the first\r\ntrial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have\nthem odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd;' he guesses odd,\nand wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first he would have\nreasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed\nodd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first\nimpulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first\r\nsimpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too\nsimple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as\nbefore. I will therefore guess even;' he guesses even, and wins. Now\nthis mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows term\n'lucky,'--what, in its last analysis, is it?\"\n\n\"It is merely,\" I said, \"an identification of the reasoner's intellect\nwith that of his opponent.\"\r\n\"It is,\" said Dupin; \"and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he\neffected the _thorough_ identification in which his success consisted,\nI received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or\nhow stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his\nthoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as\naccurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and","then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or\nheart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.' This\nresponse of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious\nprofundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucauld, to La Bruyère,\nto Machiavelli, and to Campanella.\"\n\n\"And the identification,\" I said, \"of the reasoner's intellect with\nthat of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the\naccuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured.\"\n\n\"For its practical value it depends upon this,\" replied Dupin, \"and\nthe Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of\nthis identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather\nthrough non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are\r\nengaged. They consider only their _own_ ideas of ingenuity; and, in\nsearching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which\n_they_ would have hidden it. They are right in this much--that their\nown ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of _the mass_: but\nwhen the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from\ntheir own, the felon foils them, of course. This always happens when\r\nit is above their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no\nvariation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by\nsome unusual emergency--by some extraordinary reward--they extend or\nexaggerate their old modes of _practice_, without touching their\nprinciples.  What, for example, in this case of D----, has been done\nto vary the principle of action? What is all this boring, and probing,\r\nand sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope, and dividing the\nsurface of the building into registered square inches--what is it all\nbut an exaggeration _of the application_ of the one principle or set\nof principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions\nregarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine\nof his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for","granted that _all_ men proceed to conceal a letter,--not exactly in a\ngimlet-hole bored in a chair leg--but, at least, in _some_\nout-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought\nwhich would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a\nchair-leg? And do you not see, also, that such _recherchés_ nooks for\nconcealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions and would be\r\nadopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment,\na disposal of the article concealed--a disposal of it in this\n_recherché_ manner--is, in the very first instance, presumable and\npresumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen,\nbut altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the\nseekers; and where the case is of importance--or, what amounts to the\r\nsame thing in policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude--the\nqualities in question have _never_ been known to fail. You will now\nunderstand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter\nbeen hidden anywhere within the limits of the Prefect's\nexamination--in other words, had the principle of its concealment been\ncomprehended within the principles of the Prefect--its discovery would\r\nhave been a matter altogether beyond question. This functionary,\nhowever, has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his\ndefeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he\nhas acquired renown as a poet.  All fools are poets; this the Prefect\n_feels_; and he is merely guilty of a _non distributio medii_ in\nthence inferring that all poets are fools.\"\r\n\"But is this really the poet?\" I asked. \"There are two brothers, I\nknow; and both have attained reputation in letters. The Minister, I\nbelieve, has written learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a\nmathematician, and no poet\"\n\n\"You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet _and_\nmathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could\nnot have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the","Prefect.\"\n\n\"You surprise me,\" I said, \"by these opinions, which have been\ncontradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at\nnaught the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason\nhas long been regarded as _the_ reason _par excellence_.\"\n\n\"'_Il-y-a à parier_,'\" replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, \"'_que\ntoute idée publique, toute convention reçue, est une sottise, car elle\r\na convenue au plus grand nombre_.' The mathematicians, I grant you,\nhave done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you\nallude, and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as\ntruth. With an art worthy a better cause, for example, they have\ninsinuated the term 'analysis' into application to algebra. The French\nare the originators of this particular deception ; but if a term is of\r\nany importance--if words derive any value from applicability--then\n'analysis' conveys 'algebra,' about as much as, in Latin, '_ambitus_'\nimplies 'ambition,' '_religio_,' 'religion,' or '_homines honesti_,'a\nset of honorable men.\"\n\n\"You have a quarrel on hand, I see,\" said I, \"with some of the\nalgebraists of Paris; but proceed.\"\n\n\"I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which\nis cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly\nlogical. I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical\nstudy. The mathematics are the science of form and quantity;\nmathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon\nform and quantity. The great error lies in supposing that even the\ntruths of what is called _pure_ algebra are abstract or general\r\ntruths. And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the\nuniversality with which it has been received. Mathematical axioms are\n_not_ axioms of general truth. What is true of _relation_--of form and\nquantity--is often grossly false in regard to morals, for example. In\nthis latter science it is very usually _un_true that the aggregated\nparts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In","the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given\nvalue, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of\ntheir values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which\nare only truths within the limits of _relation_. But the mathematician\nargues, from his _finite truths_, through habit, as if they were of an\nabsolutely general applicability--as the world indeed imagines them to\r\nbe. Bryant, in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentions an analogous\nsource of error, when he says that 'although the Pagan fables are not\nbelieved, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences\nfrom them as existing realities.'  With the algebraists, however, who\nare Pagans themselves, the 'Pagan fables' _are_ believed, and the\ninferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through\nan unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I neyer yet\nencountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal\nroots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his\nfaith that _x²+px_ was absolutely and unconditionally equal to _q_.\nSay to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please,\nthat you believe occasions may occur where _x²+px_ is _not_\r\naltogether equal to _q_, and, having made him understand what you\nmean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond\ndoubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.\n\n\"I mean to say,\" continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his last\nobservations, \"that if the Minister had been no more than a\nmathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of\ngiving me this check. I knew him, however, as both mathematician and\npoet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to\nthe circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as courtier,\ntoo, and as a bold _intriguant_. Such a man, I considered, could not\nfail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could\nnot have failed to anticipate--and events have proved that he did not","fail to anticipate--the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must\nhave foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his\npremises. His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed\nby the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as\nruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and\nthus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G----, in\r\nfact, did finally arrive--the conviction that the letter was not upon\nthe premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I\nwas at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the\ninvariable principle of policial action in searches for articles\nconcealed--I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily\npass through the mind of the Minister. It would imperatively lead him\r\nto despise all the ordinary _nooks_ of concealment.  _He_ could not, I\nreflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote\nrecess of his Hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the\neyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the\nPrefect. I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of\ncourse, to _simplicity_, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter\r\nof choice.  You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect\nlaughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just\npossible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so\n_very_ self-evident.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"I remember his merriment well. I really thought he\nwould have fallen into convulsions.\"\n\n\"The material world,\" continued Dupin, \"abounds with very strict\r\nanalogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been\ngiven to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made\nto strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description. The\nprinciple of the _vis inertiæ_, for example, seems to be identical in\nphysics and metaphysics.  It is not more true in the former, that a\nlarge body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one,","and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty,\nthan it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity,\nwhile more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their\nmovements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily\nmoved, and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few\nsteps of their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the\r\nstreet signs, over the shop-doors, are the most attractive of\nattention?\"\n\n\"I have never given the matter a thought,\" I said.\n\n\"There is a game of puzzles,\" he resumed, \"which is played upon a\nmap. One party playing requires another to find a given word--the name\nof town, river, state, or empire--any word, in short, upon the motley\nand perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally\nseeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely\nlettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large\ncharacters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the\nover-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape\nobservation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the\nphysical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral\r\ninapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those\nconsiderations which are too obtrusively and too palpably\nself-evident.  But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or\nbeneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thought it\nprobable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter\nimmediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best\npreventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.\r\n\"But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating\ningenuity of D----; upon the fact that the document must always have\nbeen _at hand,_ if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the\ndecisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden\nwithin the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search--the more\nsatisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had","resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not\nattempting to conceal it at all.\n\n\"Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green\nspectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the\nMinisterial Hotel. I found D---- at home, yawning, lounging, and\ndawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of\nennui. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now\r\nalive--but that is only when nobody sees him.\n\n\"To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the\nnecessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and\nthoroughly surveyed the apartment, while seemingly intent only upon\nthe conversation of my host.\n\n\"I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat,\nand upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other\r\npapers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here,\nhowever, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to\nexcite particular suspicion.\n\n\"At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a\ntrumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a\ndirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of\nthe mantelpiece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments,\nwere five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last was\nmuch soiled and crumpled.  It was torn nearly in two, across the\nmiddle--as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up\nas worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a\nlarge black seal, bearing the D---- cipher _very_ conspicuously, and","was addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D----, the Minister\nhimself. It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed,\ncontemptuously, into one of the upper divisions of the rack.\n\n\"No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be\nthat of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance,\nradically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so\nminute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the\nD---- cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the\nS---- family.  Here, the address, to the Minister, was diminutive and\nfeminine; there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was\nmarkedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of\ncorrespondence. But then, the _radicalness_ of these differences,\r\nwhich was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the\npaper, so inconsistent with the _true_ methodical habits of D----, and\nso suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the\nworthlessness of the document; these things, together with the\nhyperobtrusive situation of this document, full in the view of every\nvisitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which\r\nI had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly\ncorroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to\nsuspect.\n\n\"I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a\nmost animated discussion with the Minister, upon a topic which I knew\nwell had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention\nreally riveted upon the letter.  In this examination, I committed to\r\nmemory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also\nfell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial\ndoubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the\npaper, I observed them to be more _chafed_ than seemed necessary. They\npresented the _broken_ appearance which is manifested when a stiff\npaper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded","in a reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed\nthe original fold.  This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me\nthat the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed,\nand re-sealed. I bade the Minister good-morning, and took my departure\nat once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table.\n\n\"The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite\r\neagerly, the conversation of the preceding day.  While thus engaged,\nhowever, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately\nbeneath the windows of the Hotel, and was succeeded by a series of\nfearful screams, and the shoutings of a mob. D---- rushed to a\ncasement, threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to\nthe card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it\r\nby a facsimile (so far as regards externals), which I had carefully\nprepared at my lodgings--imitating the D---- cipher, very readily, by\nmeans of a seal formed of bread.\n\n\"The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic\nbehavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of\nwomen and children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and\nthe fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When\r\nhe had gone, D---- came from the window, whither I had followed him\nimmediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade\nhim farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.\"\n\n\"But what purpose had you,\" I asked, \"in replacing the letter by a\nfacsimile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have\nseized it openly, and departed?\"\n\n\"D----,\" replied Dupin, \"is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His\r\nHotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I\nmade the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the\nMinisterial presence alive. The good 30 people of Paris might have\nheard of me no more. But I had an object apart from these\nconsiderations. You know my political prepossessions. In this matter,\nI act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the","Minister has had her in his power. She has now him in hers--since,\nbeing unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will\nproceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will he inevitably\ncommit himself, at once, to his political destruction. His downfall,\ntoo, will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very well to\ntalk about the _facilis descensus Averni_; but in all kinds of\r\nclimbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up\nthan to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy--at\nleast no pity--for him who descends. He is that _monstrum horrendum_,\nan unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I should like\nvery well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being\ndefied by her whom the Prefect terms 'a certain personage,' he is\r\nreduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.\"\n\n\n\"How? Did you put anything particular in it?\"\n\n\"Why--it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior\nblank--that would have been insulting. D----, at Vienna once, did me\nan evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should\nremember. So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the\nidentity of the person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not\nto give him a clew. He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just\ncopied into the middle of the blank sheet the words--\n\n  '--Un dessein si funeste,\n  S'il n'est digne d'Atrée, est digne de Thyeste.'\n\nThey are to be found in Crébillon's _Atrée_.\"\n\n\n\n\nNOTES\n\n\nThe text followed both for poems and tales is that of the\r\nStedman-Woodberry edition of Poe's Works, in which the editors\nfollowed, in most cases, the text of what is known as the \"Lorimer\nGraham\" copy of the edition of 1845, containing marginal corrections\nin Poe's own hand. Poe revised his work frequently and sometimes\nextensively. The following notes show, in most cases, the dates both\nof the first publication and of subsequent ones. Familiarity with the","Introduction to this book will, in some cases, be necessary to an\nunderstanding of the notes. Gayley's \"Classic Myths in English\nLiterature\" (Ginn & Company, $1.50) is the best reference work of\nsmall size for allusions to mythology, and should be available.\n\nBoth poems and tales are arranged in chronological order.\n\n\n\nPOEMS\n\n\nSONG (Page 3)\n\nPublished in 1827, 1829, and 1845. The poem is believed to refer to\r\nMiss Royster, of Richmond, with whom Poe was in love as a boy of\nsixteen, shortly before he entered the University of Virginia. The\nyoung lady's father intercepted the correspondence, and Miss Royster\nsoon became Mrs. Shelton. The blush, mentioned in lines 2, 9, and 14,\nis doubtless intended to imply shame for her desertion. The poem is\ncommonplace, and shows little that is characteristic of the older Poe.\n\n\nSPIRITS OF THE DEAD (Page 3)\n\nPublished in 1827 as \"Visit of the Dead,\" and in 1829 and 1839 under\nthe above title. It has been conjectured that this poem was inspired\nby the death of Mrs. Stannard (see Introduction, page xii).\n\n\nTO ---- (Page 4)\n\nThe original, longer and addressed \"To M----,\" appeared in the edition\nof 1829, and was republished in 1845.\n\n\nROMANCE (Page 5)\r\nPrinted as a preface in 1829, and as an introduction in 1831;\nconsiderably revised and shortened, it appeared in 1843 and 1845 as\n\"Romance.\"\n\n11. condor years. The metaphor implies a likeness of time--the\nyears--to a bird of prey. Cf. \"condor wings\" in \"The Conqueror Worm.\"\n\n19. forbidden things: i.e. \"lyre and rhyme.\" What is the meaning?\n\n\nTO THE RIVER-- (Page 5)\n\nPublished first in 1829, afterwards in several magazines and in the\r\nedition of 1845.\n\n\nTO SCIENCE (Page 6)\n\nPublished first in 1829, this poem appeared in editions of 1831 and\n1845, and in magazines. It is a sonnet, differing from the\nShakespearean form only in the repetition of the rhyme with \"eyes.\"\n\n9, 10, 12. In classical mythology, Diana is the moon goddess,\nHamadryad, a wood nymph, Naiad, a water nymph. Consult Gayley's\n\"Classic Myths.\" Explain the figures of speech.","13. Elfin: elf, a fairy, from the Anglo-Saxon, refers especially to\ntiny sprites, fond of mischief and tricks. But there were various\nkinds of elves, according to the Norse mythology. Consult Gayley's\n\"Classic Myths.\" Explain the figure.\n\n14. tamarind-tree: a beautiful, spreading, Oriental tree, with pinnate\nleaves and showy racemes of yellow flowers variegated with red. What\ndoes the line mean?\n\n\nTO HELEN (Page 7)\n\nPublished in 1831, 1836, 1841, 1843, and 1845. Read comment in the\nIntroduction, pages xii and xxiii.\n\n2. Nicæan barks. It is impossible to say exactly what this allusion\nmeans. Professor W.P. Trent aptly suggests that if \"wanderer\" in line\n4 refers to Ulysses, as seems likely, \"Phæacian\" would have been the\nright word, since the Phæacians did convey Ulysses to Ithaca. Poe may\r\nhave had that idea in mind and used the wrong word, or this may simply\nbe a characteristically vague suggestion of antiquity. Point out\nsimilar examples of indefinite suggestion in this poem.\n\n7. hyacinth hair: a favorite term with Poe. In \"The Assignation\" he\nsays of the Marchesa Aphrodite, \"Her hair ... clustered round and\nround her classical head, in curls like those of the young hyacinth.\"\r\nThe hair of Ligeia, in the story of that title, he calls \"the\nraven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling tresses,\nsetting forth the full force of the Homeric epithet, 'hyacinthine.'\"\n\n8. Naiad airs: suggestive of exquisite grace. The Naiads, in\nclassical mythology, are water nymphs,--lovely maidens presiding over\nbrooks and fountains.\n\n9, 10. Two of Poe's best and most frequently quoted lines. Explain the\r\nfitness of the epithets. Originally the lines read:\n\n  To the beauty of fair Greece\n  And the grandeur of old Rome.\n\nIs the change an improvement? Explain.\n\n14. Psyche: the Greek word for \"soul,\" and also the name of a\nbeautiful maiden whom Cupid himself loved and wedded. Read the story\nin Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\"\n\n\nISRAFEL (Page 7)\n\nPublished in editions of 1831 and 1845, and several times in","magazines. See comment in the Introduction, page xxiii. Poe derived\nthe quotation through Moore's \"Lalla Rookh,\" altered it slightly, and\ninterpolated the clause, \"whose heart-strings are a lute\"; it is from\nSale's \"Preliminary Discourse\" to the Koran.\n\n12. levin, or leven: an archaic word for \"lightning.\"\n\n13. Pleiads, or Pleiades: a group of stars in the constellation\nTaurus; only six stars of the group are readily visible, but legend\r\ntells of a seventh, lost. Read the account of the ancient myth in\nGayley's \"Classic Myths.\"\n\n23. skies: the object of \"trod.\"\n\n26. Houri: derived from an Arabian word meaning \"to have\nbrilliant black eyes.\" It is the name in Mohammedan tradition for\nbeautiful nymphs of Paradise, who are to be companions of the pious.\n\n\nTHE CITY IN THE SEA (Page 9)\n\nPublished in 1831 as \"The Doomed City,\" in 1836 as \"The City of Sin,\"\nand several times in 1845 under the above title.\n\nPoint out examples of alliteration.\n\n18. Babylon-like walls. The walls of the ancient city of\nBabylon, on the Euphrates, were famous for massiveness and extent.\n\n\nTHE SLEEPER (Page 11)\n\nPublished as \"Irene\" in 1831 and 1836, and as \"The Sleeper\" in 1843\nand 1845. The theme is Poe's favorite, the death of a beautiful young\r\nwoman, and the poem is remarkable, even among Poe's, for its melody.\n\n\nLENORE (Page 13)\n\nPublished as \"A Pæan\" in 1831 and 1836, and as \"Lenore\" in 1843 and\n1845. It was much altered in its numerous revisions.\n\n1. broken is the golden bowl. See Ecclesiastes xii. 6.\n\n2. Stygian river. The Styx was a river of Hades, across which\nthe souls of the dead had to be ferried.\n\n3. Guy De Vere: the mourning lover. It is he who speaks in the\r\nsecond and fourth stanzas.\n\n13. Peccavimus: literally, \"we have sinned.\" This stanza is the\nreply of the false friends.\n\n\nTHE VALLEY OF UNREST (Page 14)\n\nPublished in 1831 as \"The Valley Nis,\" with an obscure allusion to a\n\"Syriac Tale\":\n\n  Something about Satan's dart--\n  Something about angel wings--\n  Much about a broken heart--\n  All about unhappy things:\n  But \"the Valley Nis\" at best","Means \"the Valley of Unrest.\"\n\nLater it was published in magazines and in the 1845 edition, revised\nand improved, and transformed into a simple landscape picture,--one of\nthe strange, weird, unearthly landscapes so characteristic of Poe.\n\n\nTHE COLISEUM (Page 15)\n\nThis poem was submitted in the prize contest in Baltimore in 1833, and\nwould have been successful but for the fact that the author's story,\r\n\"The Manuscript Found in a Bottle,\" had taken the first prize in its\nclass. It was republished several times, but not much altered. The\nusual spelling is \"Colosseum.\" It is very unlikely that Poe ever saw\nthe Colosseum, though it is barely possible his foster parents may\nhave taken him to Rome during the English residence (see Introduction,\npage xii).\n\n13-14. Apparently a reference to Jesus, but characteristically vague.\r\n15-16. The ancient Chaldeans were famous students of the heavens and\npracticed fortune telling by the stars; during the Middle Ages\nastrologers were commonly called \"Chaldeans.\"\n\n17. hero fell. Explain the allusion. Read an account of the\nColosseum in a history or reference book.\n\n18. mimic eagle: the eagle on the Roman standard.\n\n20. gilded hair: adorned with golden ornaments.\n\n26-29. arcades, plinths, shafts, entablatures, frieze,\ncornices. Consult the dictionary and explain these architectural\nterms.\n\n36. Memnon: a gigantic statue of this Greek hero on the banks\nof the Nile was said to salute the rising sun with a musical note.\n\n\nHYMN (Page 16)\n\nPublished in 1835 in the tale \"Morella,\" and several times afterward\nin magazines and collections. As an expression of simple, religious\r\ntrust and hope, this poem stands quite apart from all others by Poe.\n\n\nTO ONE IN  PARADISE (Page 17)\n\nPublished in 1835 as part of the tale called \"The Visionary,\"\nafterward \"The Assignation\"; in 1839 in a magazine under the title \"To\nIanthe in Heaven\"; and several times afterward in magazines and in\ncollections. It fits admirably into the story \"The Assignation,\" where","it contains this additional stanza, readily understood in its setting:\n\n  Alas! for that accursed time\n    They bore thee o'er the billow,\n  From Love to titled age and crime\n    And an unholy pillow--\n  From me, and from our misty clime\n    Where weeps the silver willow.\n\n\nTO F---- (Page 18)\n\nAppeared in 1835 under the title \"To Mary,\" and in 1842 and 1843, \"To\nOne Departed.\" It is not known to whom these forms were addressed. In\r\n1845 it again appeared with the above title, which is believed to\nrefer to Mrs. Frances Sargent Osgood, a poet of the time, whom Poe\ngreatly admired.\n\n\nTO F----S S. O----D (Page 18)\n\nFirst appeared in the _Southern Literary Messenger_(1835) as \"Lines\nWritten in an Album,\" addressed to Eliza White, a young daughter of\nthe editor of the _Messenger_; in 1839 the same lines were addressed\r\n\"To ----,\" whose name is unknown; and in 1845 they were addressed\nunder the above title to Mrs. Osgood (see note on the preceding poem).\n\n\nTO ZANTE (Page 18)\n\nPublished in 1837, 1843, and 1845. In form this is a regular\nShakespearean sonnet. Zante is one of the principal Ionian islands, in\nancient times called Zacynthus. Again the poet writes of a fair isle\nin the sea; point out other instances. Note the fondness for \"no\r\nmore,\" and find examples in other poems. As usual with Poe, the thread\nof thought is slight and indefinite; apparently the beautiful island\nhas become \"accursed ground\" because of the death there of the \"maiden\nthat is no more.\"\n\n1. fairest of all flowers. There is a zantewood, or satinwood,\nbut it does not take its name from this island. Poe associated the\nname of the island with the hyacinth, but there is no etymological\r\nconnection.  He probably derived his fancy from a passage in\nChateaubriand's \"Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem,\" page 53.\n\n13. hyacinthine isle: a reference to the flowers of the island\n(see preceding note).\n\n14. \"Isola d'oro!  Fior di Levante!\" \"Golden Isle! Flower of\nthe Levant!\" These are Italian terms for Zante; they occur in the\npassage in Chateaubriand referred to in the note on line 1.\n\n\nBRIDAL BALLAD (Page 19)","Published in 1837, 1841, 1845, and greatly improved in revision. The\nbride remembers her dead lover who died in battle, and wonders\nfearfully whether \"the dead who is forsaken\" knows and is unhappy.\n\n\nSILENCE (Page 20)\n\nPublished in 1840, 1843, and 1845.\n\n\nTHE CONQUEROR WORM (Page 21)\n\nPublished in 1843 and 1845. The repulsive imagery recurs in several of\nthe tales and poems, and shows one of the most morbid phases of Poe's\r\nimagination (see Introduction, page xxiv). It would hardly meet Poe's\nown test of beauty, but the grim power of this terrible picture is\npalpable enough.\n\n9. Mimes: actors, who in this case are men; mankind.\n\n13. vast formless things: doubtless the Fates (consult Gayley's\n\"Classic Myths\"); at any rate beings who exercise the same powers.\n\n15. condor wings. The condor is a great vulture of South\r\nAmerica; the word here suggests the Fates preying on human happiness,\nhealth, and life.\n\n18. Phantom: happiness, or perhaps any object of human desire\nor ambition.\n\n\nDREAM-LAND (Page 22)\n\nPublished in 1844 and 1845. The poem paints another of Poe's\nextraordinary landscapes.\n\n3. Eidolon: phantom, specter, shade.\n\n6. ultimate dim Thule. \"Thule\" was used by the ancients to\nindicate extreme northern regions; the Romans used the phrase \"Ultima\r\nThule\" to denote the most remote, unknown land. What does the allusion\nsignify here?\n\n\nTHE RAVEN (Page 24)\n\nPublished in 1845 in various magazines, first in the New York _Evening\nMirror_ of January 29. This is the most famous if not the best of\nPoe's poems. There is a clear thread of narrative and greater dramatic\ninterest than in any other of the author's poems. If possible, read\r\n\"The Philosophy of Composition,\" in which Poe gives a remarkable\naccount of the composition of this poem, an account which is to be\naccepted, however, as explaining only the mechanical side of the\nwork. This essay is included in Cody's \"Best Poems and Essays\" (see\nBibliography, page xxxi). Read the comment in the Introduction, page\nxxiv. Note the numerous alliterations.","34. thereat is. Was the idea phrased this way for any other\npurpose than to make a rhyme? Is it artistic?\n\n\n38. Raven. Read an account of the bird in a natural history or\nan encyclopedia; it is frequently mentioned in English literature as a\nbird of ill omen.\n\n41. Pallas: Minerva, goddess of wisdom. Consult Gayley's\n\"Classic Myths.\" Is a bust of Pallas appropriate for a library?\n\n47. Plutonian: from Pluto, god of the underworld.\r\n64, 65. burden: thought or theme.\n\n76-77. gloated ... gloating. It is impossible to say just what\nis suggested. It is characteristically vague. Find other examples in\nthis poem.\n\n80. tinkled on the tufted floor. Not very easy to imagine. In\n\"Ligeia,\" Poe speaks of \"carpets of tufted gold,\" apparently meaning\nfabrics of very thick and rich material. Perhaps we may think of the\ntinkling as proceeding from tiny bells.\n\n81. \"Wretch,\" etc. The lover addresses himself.\n\n82. nepenthe: a name given in Homer's \"Odyssey\" to a drug\noffered to Helen in Egypt, the effect of which was to banish all grief\nand pain.  Later the term was sometimes used for opium.\n\n89. balm in Gilead. Gilead is a district on the banks of the\nJordan and the \"balm\" an herb of reputed medicinal value. The allusion\r\nhere is to Jeremiah viii.22: \"Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no\nphysician there?\" The lover means to ask if there is any remedy for\nhis sorrow, any consolation. Perhaps he means, \"Is there any solace\nafter death?\" or \"Is there any solace either in this world or the\nnext?\"\n\n93. Aidenn: Eden, Paradise, from the Arabic form _Adn_; coined\nby Poe for the rhyme.\n\n101. This line, Poe said in \"The Philosophy of Composition,\" first\nbetrays clearly the allegorical nature of the poem.\n\n106. the lamp-light o'er him streaming. In answer to criticism\non this line, Poe explained, \"My conception was that of the bracket\ncandelabrum affixed against the wall, high up above the door and bust,\nas is often seen in the English palaces, and even in some of the\nbetter houses of New York.\"","107, 108. In these last lines the allegory is fully revealed.\n\n\nEULALIE (Page 29)\n\nPublished in 1845 with the subtitle, \"A Song.\"\n\n19. Astarte. See note on line 37 of \"Ulalume,\" page 189.\n\n\nTO M.L. S----- (Page 30)\n\nPublished March 13, 1847, and addressed to Mrs. Marie Louise Shew, who\nhad been a veritable angel of mercy in the Poe home. She relieved the\npoverty and helped to care for Virginia (who died January 29), and\r\nafterward nursed Poe himself during his severe illness.  Mrs. Shew had\nhad some medical training and probably saved Poe's life. This brief\npoem is instinct with a gratitude and reverence easy to understand,\nand is, for Poe, unusually spontaneous.\n\n\nULALUME (Page 30)\n\nPublished in December, 1847, and in January, 1848. The earlier form\ncontained an additional stanza, afterward wisely omitted. Read the\r\ncomment on the poem in the Introduction, pages xxiv-xxv.\n\n5. Immemorial: properly means extending indefinitely into the\npast. Poe may mean that the year has seemed endless to him, but\napparently he uses the word in the sense of memorable.\n\n6, 7. Auber rhymes with October, Weir with year; the\nnames were coined by Poe for rhyme and tone color. Note the\nresemblance of \"Weir\" to \"weird.\"\r\n8. tarn: a small mountain lake. It is used provincially in\nEngland to mean a boggy or marshy tract. Poe used the word to signify\na dark, stagnant pool. Cf. \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" page 49.\n\n11. cypress.  What is its significance?\n\n12. Psyche: soul. Cf. note on line 14 of \"To Helen,\" page 183.\n\n14. scoriac: a very rare word, from _scoria_ (lava).\n\n16. Yaanek: another specially coined word.\n\n35. crescent: suggesting hope.\r\n37, 39. Astarte: a Phoenician goddess, as the deity of love\ncorresponding to Venus (Aphrodite), and as moon goddess to Dian, or\nDiana (Artemis). But Diana was chaste and cold to the advances of\nlovers, which explains \"she (Astarte) is warmer than Dian.\"\n\n\n43. where the worm never dies: implies the gnawing of unending\ngrief. Cf. Isaiah lxvi. 24, and Mark ix. 44, 46, 48.\n\n44.  The Lion: the constellation Leo.","64. sibyllic: usually \"sibylline,\" prophetic; from \"sibyl.\"\nConsult Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\"\n\n179. legended tomb: having on it an inscription.\n\n\nTO ---- ---- (Page 33)\n\nPublished in March, 1848, and is another tribute to Mrs. Shew. See\nnote on \"To M.L. S-----,\" page 188.\n\n9-10. The quotation is from George Peele's \"David and Bethsabe,\" an\nEnglish drama published in 1599:\n\n   Or let the dew be sweeter far than that\r\nThat hangs, like chains of pearl, on Hermon hill.\n\n14-15. Cf. the poem \"Israfel,\" and the notes on it.\n\n\nAN ENIGMA (Page 34)\n\nPublished in March, 1848. To find the name, read the first letter of\nthe first line, the second letter of the second line, and so on. In\nform this is a sonnet irregular in rhyme scheme.\n\n1. Solomon Don Dunce: a fanciful name for a stupid person.\n\n6. Petrarchan stuff: of or by Petrarch (1304-1374), a famous\r\nItalian writer of sonnets.\n\n10. tuckermanities: a contemptuous allusion to the poetic\nefforts of Henry T. Tuckerman, a New England writer of the day.\n\n14. dear names: Sarah Anna Lewis, a verse writer of the day,\nwhom Poe admired.\n\n\nTO HELEN (Page 35)\n\nPublished in November, 1848; addressed to Mrs. Sarah Helen Whitman\n(see Introduction, page xvii). Although her engagement to marry Poe\r\nwas broken off, she continued to admire him and was faithful to his\nmemory after his death. The poem was written before Poe met Mrs.\nWhitman, and is said to have been suggested by the poet's having\ncaught a glimpse of the lady walking in a garden by moonlight.\n\n48. Dian:  Diana, the moon goddess.\n\n66. Venuses: refers at once to the planet Venus and to Venus,\ngoddess of love.\n\n\nA VALENTINE (Page 37)\r\nPublished in 1849. The name is found as in \"An Enigma,\" by reading the\nfirst letter of the first line, the second of the second, and so on.\n\n2. twins of Leda: Castor and Pollux, two stars in the\nconstellation Gemini. For the myth consult Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\"\n\n3. her own sweet name: Frances Sargent Osgood. See note on the\nlines \"To F---- ,\" page 185.\n\n10. Gordian knot.   Explain this; consult an encyclopedia.","14. perdus: lost, a French word introduced to rhyme with \"too.\"\n\n17. lying: used in a double sense.\n\n18. Mendez Ferdinando Pinto, a Portuguese traveler (1509-1583),\nwas said to have been the first white man to visit Japan. He wrote an\naccount of his travels, which at the time was considered mere\nromancing.\n\n\nFOR ANNIE (Page 37)\n\nPublished in 1849, and addressed to Mrs. Richmond of Lowell,\nMassachusetts.  This is the \"Annie\" so frequently referred to in\nbiographies of Poe, who also figures in his correspondence. Of all the\nwomen associated with Poe's later years (see Introduction, pages ),\n\"Annie\" was the object of his most sincere and ardent friendship, and\nwas his confidant in all his troubles,--including the courtship of\nMrs. Whitman. Poe and Mrs. Clemm were frequent visitors at her home,\r\nand the latter found shelter there for a time after her \"Eddie's\"\ndeath.\n\nThis poem is usually regarded as one of the author's poorest, though\nit has a distinctly individual character that must be recognized. Thus\nProfessor C.F. Richardson, in his \"American Literature,\" quoting\nseveral stanzas, remarks, \"This is doggerel, but it is Poe's special\ndoggerel.\"  Some of the lines really deserve this severe epithet, but\r\nhardly the entire poem. Its theme seems to be peace in death through\nthe affection of Annie, following a life of passion and sorrow, and so\nregarded, it has some strength.\n\n\nTHE BELLS (Page 41)\n\nPublished in 1849. Read the comment on this poem in the Introduction,\npage xxv. Though not especially characteristic of him, this is one of\nPoe's most remarkable poems, as well as one of the most popular. A\r\nvery interesting account of its composition may be found in\nWoodberry's biography, pages 302-304, or in Harrison's biography,\npages 286-288, or in the Stedman-Woodberry edition of Poe's Works,\nVol. X, pages 183-186.\n\n10. Runic. Runes are the characters of the alphabet of the\nearly Germanic peoples. The allusion is intended to suggest mystery\nand magic. Consult an unabridged dictionary or an encyclopedia.","23. gloats. What does the word mean here? Cf. line 76 of \"The\nRaven,\" and corresponding notes.\n\n\nANNABEL LEE (Page 44)\n\nPublished in the _New York Tribune, _October 9, 1849, two days after\nthe poet's death. Read the comment in the Introduction, page xxv. Note\nthe mid-rhymes in line 26, \"chilling and killing,\" and in line 32,\n\"ever dissever\"; point out other examples in \"The Raven\" and other\npoems.\r\nTO MY MOTHER (Page 46)\n\nPublished in 1849; in form, a regular Shakespearean sonnet. It is a\nsincere tribute addressed to Mrs. Clemm, mother of Poe's girl wife,\nVirginia, a woman who was more than worthy of it. The tenderest\naffection existed between the two, and Mrs. Clemm cared for him after\nVirginia's death and grieved profoundly at his own. She lived until\n1871.\n\n\nELDORADO (Page 46)\r\nThis first appeared in the Griswold edition of 1850; no earlier\npublication is known. It was probably Poe's last composition, and this\nstory of the knight's quest, its failure, and his gaze turned to \"the\nValley of the Shadow,\" is a fitting finale for the ill-starred poet\n(see comment in the Introduction, page xxv).\n\nEldorado: a fabled city or country abounding in gold and\nprecious stones, and afterward any place of great wealth. The word is\r\noften used figuratively. In a preface to an early volume of his\npoetry, Poe alludes quite incidentally to \"the poet's own kingdom--his\nEl Dorado,\" and in this sense the metaphor may be accepted here.\n\nNote the varying sense of the recurring rhyme, shadow. In the\nfirst stanza it is simply contrasted with the \"sunshine\" or happiness\nof life, in the second it implies the coming of discouragement and\r\ndespair, in the third it is the shadow of death cast before, in the\nfourth the Valley of the Shadow of Death.\n\n\nTHE HAUNTED PALACE (Page 59)\n\nPublished in the _Baltimore Museum_ in April, 1839, and in September\nof the same year in _Burton's Gentleman's Magazine_ as part of the\ntale \"The Fall of the House of Usher\"; afterwards published in 1840,\n1843, and 1845. It was altered very slightly in revision. Lowell wrote","that he knew of no modern poet who might not justly be proud of it\n(see Introduction, pages xxiii-xxiv).\n\n59. 24. Porphyrogene: from Greek words meaning \"purple\"\nand \"begotten,\" hence, born in the purple, royal. This term, or\n\"porphyrogenitus,\" was applied in the Byzantine empire to children of\nthe monarch born after his accession to the throne. It is not clear\nwhether the word is used here as a descriptive adjective or as the\nname of the monarch.\n\n\n\nTALES\n\n\nTHE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER (Page 49)\n\nPublished first in 1839, and several times reprinted with revisions.\nRead the comment in the Introduction, page xxvii. Lowell said of this\nstory: \"Had its author written nothing else, it would alone have been\nenough to stamp him as a man of genius, and a master of a classic\nstyle.\"\r\nThis tale is one of the best to study as an example of the application\nof Poe's critical theory of the short story (see Introduction, page\nxxvi).  What is the \"effect\" sought? Is the main incident of the tale\nwell adapted to produce this effect? Are the parts skillfully related\nto one another and to the whole? Is the setting suitable to the theme?\nWhat is the effect of the first sentence? Pick out a number of rather\r\nunusual words which Poe seems particularly to like; observe their\neffect. The adjectives are especially worth study; in the first\nsentence try the effect of substituting for \"soundless,\" \"quiet,\" or\n\"silent,\" or \"noiseless.\"\n\n49. Quotation: \"His heart is a suspended lute; as soon as it is\ntouched it resounds.\" P.J. Béranger (1780-1857), a popular French\nlyric poet.\n\n50. 12. black and lurid tarn: see note to line 8 of \"Ulalume,\"","page 189. Tarn is one of several words Poe particularly liked.\n\n58. 10. low cunning. See if the reason for this encounter\nappears later.\n\n58 31. ennuyé: a French word meaning \"wearied,\" \"bored.\"\n\n54. 5-24. The description of Usher is in the main a remarkably good\nportrait of Poe himself.\n\n55. 20-30. Observe the extreme to which Poe goes in this study of\nterror; it is the fear of fear that oppresses Usher.\n\n56. 2. too shadowy here to be re-stated.  Note the effect of\nmaking this weird suggestion instead of a clear statement.\n\n57. 26. Von Weber (1786-1826), a famous German composer.\n\n58. 5. Henry Fuseli, or Fuesli (1742-1825), as he was known in\nEngland, was born in Zurich, Switzerland, and named Johann Heinrich\nFuessli. He was a professor in the Royal Academy and painted a series\r\nof highly imaginative pictures illustrating Shakespeare and Milton.\n\n59. The Haunted Palace. For notes see page 192.\n\n60. 30-31. Richard Watson (1737-1816), Bishop of Llandaff, was\nfor a time professor of chemistry at Cambridge University and wrote\npopular essays on that subject. James Gates Percival (1795-1856) was\nan American poet, musician, linguist, surgeon, and scientist; it is\npossible the reference is to Thomas Percival (1740-1804), an English\nphysician. Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729-1799) was an Italian\nnaturalist, distinguished in experimental physiology.\n\n61. 22-31. All of these titles have been traced, except the last,\nwhich Poe either invented, or, in quoting, altered.  Some of the works\nnamed he apparently had not read, since their character is not suited\r\nto his purpose. Jean Baptiste Louis Gresset (1709-1777) was a French\npoet and playwright; the two works mentioned are poems,--the first, a\ntale of an escaped parrot who stopped at a convent and shocked the\nnuns by his profanity. Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527) was a\nfamous Italian historian and statesman, who wrote a celebrated\ntreatise called \"The Prince\"; \"Belphegor\" is a satire on marriage.","Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) was an eminent Swedish\ntheologian and religious mystic.  Ludvig Holberg (1684-1754)\nwas a great Danish poet and novelist; the work mentioned is one of his\nbest known poems and has been translated into the principal languages\nof Europe. Flud, Robert Fludd (1574-1637), was an English\nphysician, inventor, and mystic philosopher. Jean D'Indaginé\n(flourished in the first half of the sixteenth century) was a priest\r\nof Steinheim, Germany, who wrote on palmistry and similar subjects.\nMarin Cureau de la Chambre (1594-1675), physician to Louis XIV,\nwho was an adept in physiognomy, and wrote a work on \"The Art of\nJudging Men.\" Ludwig Tieck (1773-1853) was a German romantic\nnovelist. Tommaso Campanella (1568-1639) was an Italian monk\nand philosopher, who suffered persecution by the Inquisition.\nEymeric, Nicolas Eymericus (1320-1399), was a native of Gerona,\r\nSpain, who entered the Dominican order and rose to the rank of\nchaplain to the Pope and Grand Inquisitor; his famous \"Directorium\nInquisitorum\" is an elaborate account of the Inquisition. Pomponius\nMela was a Latin writer of the first century A.D., who wrote a\nfamous work on geography \"De Situ Orbis\" (Concerning the Plan of the\nEarth).\n\n61. 31. Satyrs and Ægipans: in classic mythology the satyrs and\r\nminor deities of wood and field, with the body of a man and the feet,\nhair, and horns of a goat; Ægipans is practically equivalent to, and\nis also an epithet of Pan, the satyr-like rural god.\n\n61. 33-34. curious book in quarto Gothic: printed in the\nblack-faced letters of mediæval times.\n\n61. 35. The Latin title, which has not been found, means \"Vigils for\nthe Dead according to the Choir of the Church of Mayence.\"\r\n66. 1-2. The \"Mad Trist\" of Sir Launcelot Canning has not been found;\nundoubtedly the title was coined and the quotations invented to fit\nthe text, as they do perfectly.\n\n69. 24-25. It was the work of the rushing gust. Note the fine\neffect of the momentary suspense, the instant's disappointment carried\nby this clause.\n\n\nWILLIAM  WILSON\n\nFirst published in a magazine in 1840 (see comment in the","Introduction, page xxvii).\n\n71. Quotation. William Chamberlayne, an English poet and\nphysician (1619-1689), who in 1659 published \"Pharronida, a Heroic\nPoem.\"\n\n71. 18. Elah-Gabalus: usually Elagabulus, emperor of Rome from\n218-222, who indulged in the wildest debaucheries.\n\n72. 26-73 2. The description here is based on fact, apparently\nbeing a true picture of the English school attended by Poe himself\n(see Introduction, page xii).\n\n73. 31. Draconian Laws: Draco was an Athenian legislator, who codified\nthe laws of his city in 621 B.C. The penalty for every offense was\ndeath, and the laws were, therefore, said to be written in blood, not\nink.\n\n75. 5. peine forte et dure: \"punishment severe and merciless\";\na penalty formerly imposed by Enlish law upon persons who refused to\r\nplead on being arraigned for felony. It consisted in laying the\naccused on his back on a bare floor and placing a great iron weight on\nhis chest until he consented to plead or died. There is one instance\nof the infliction of this punishment in American colonial history:\nGiles Cory, accused of witchcraft, was pressed to death in\nSalem, Massachusetts, in 1692.\n\n75. 33. exergues: the exergue is a term in numismatics to\r\nsignify the space under the principal figure on the reverse of a coin,\nusually containing the date or place of coining.\n\n76. 7. \"Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!\" \"Oh! the good\ntime, the age of iron.\"\n\n86. 11. Herodes Atticus: a Greek born about A.D. 101, who\ninherited from his father, of the same name, great wealth, to which he\nadded by marriage. He was a noted teacher of rhetoric and became a\nRoman consul.\r\nA DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTRÖM (Page 94)\n\nFirst published in a magazine in 1841 (see comment in the\nIntroduction, pages xxvii-xxviii).\n\n94. Quotation. Joseph Glanville, or Glanvill (1636-1680), an\nEnglish clergyman and author of several works on philosophy and\nreligion.  The quotation has been found in the writings of Glanvill by\nProfessor Woodberry, but Poe quoted rather carelessly, and his extract","varies slightly from the original. The Democritus referred to was a\nfamous Greek philosopher, born about 470 B.C., who taught the atomic\ntheory.\n\n94. 1-3. Note the effect of the opening sentences in seizing attention\nand arousing interest at once.\n\n95. 21. Nubian geographer ... Mare Tenebrarum. The same\nallusion occurs in \"Eleonora,\" and in \"Eureka\" Poe speaks of \"the\n_Mare Tenebrarum_,--an ocean well described by the Nubian geographer,\r\nPtolemy Hephestion.\" Apparently he refers to Claudius Ptolemy, a\ncelebrated philosopher who flourished in Alexandria in the second\ncentury A.D.\n\nHis theory, known as the Ptolemaic System, remained the standard\nauthority in astronomy to the end of the Middle Ages, while his\ngeography was accepted until the era of the great discoveries opened\nin the fifteenth century. Ptolemy is thought to have been born in\nEgypt, and it is impossible to say what grounds Poe had for calling\nhim Nubian.  _Mare Tenebrarum_ means \"sea of darkness,\" the Atlantic.\n\n96. 10-15. This is a real description of the geography of the region\nof the Lofoden islands. Refer to a good map of Norway.\n\n97. 27. Maelström: from Norwegian words meaning \"grind\" and\n\"stream.\" The swift tidal currents and eddies of the Lofoden islands\r\nare very dangerous, but the early accounts are greatly exaggerated,\nand Poe's description is, aside from being based on these accounts,\npurely imaginative.\n\n97. 32. Jonas Ramus. Professor Woodberry, whose study of Poe's\ntext has been exhaustive, has an interesting note to this effect: Poe\nused an article in an early edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, in\nwhich a passage was taken from Pontoppidan's \"The Natural History of\r\nNorway\" without acknowledgment, this in turn having been taken (with\nproper acknowledgment) from Ramus. The Britannica, in the ninth\nedition, after giving Poe credit for \"erudition taken solely from a\nprevious edition of this very encyclopedia, which in its turn had\nstolen the learning from another, quotes the parts that Poe invented\nout of his own head.\" See \"Whirlpool\" in the Britannica.","98. 26-27. Norway mile: a little over four and a half English\nmiles.\n\n99. 19. Phlegethon: a river of Hades in which flowed flames\ninstead of water.\n\n100. 4. Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680) was a learned Roman Catholic\nwriter, a native of Germany. See \"Whirlpool\" in the Britannica.\n\n105. 2. what a scene it was to light up! Interest in the\nnarrative should not hurry the reader too much to appreciate this\r\nscene,--the magnificent setting of the adventure.\n\n109. 10. tottering bridge, etc.: Al Sirat, the bridge from\nearth over the abyss of hell to the Mohammedan paradise. It is as\nnarrow as a sword's edge, and while the good traverse it in safety,\nthe wicked plunge to torment.\n\n111. 35. Archimedes of Syracuse (i.e. 287--212) was the\ngreatest of ancient mathematicians; the work to which Poe refers deals\r\nwith floating bodies.\n\n\nTHE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH (Page 113)\n\nFirst published in _Graham's Magazine_ for May, 1842 (see comment in\nthe Introduction, page xxvii).\n\n113. The \"Red Death\" is a product of Poe's own imagination;\nthere is no record of such a disease in medical history.\n\n113. 3. avatar: a word from Hindoo mythology, in which it means\nan incarnation. The word is used here in its secondary sense,--a\nvisible manifestation.\n\n113. 11. This paragraph suggests the circumstances under which\nBoccaccio represents the stories of his famous \"Decameron.\" A\ncomparison will be interesting.\n\n116. 3. decora: possibly used as a plural of \"decorum,\"\npropriety; probably it is intended to suggest ornamentation.\n\n116. 14. Hernani: a well-known tragedy by the great French\nwriter, Victor Hugo (1802-1885).\r\nTHE GOLD-BUG (Page 120)\n\nFirst published in the _Dollar Newspaper_ of Philadelphia in June,\n1843, as the $100 prize story (see comment in the Introduction, page\nxxviii).  This is the best and most widely read of the stories\nregarding Captain Kidd's treasure. Read an account of Captain Kidd in\nan encyclopedia or dictionary of biography.\n\nIs the main incident of the story the discovery of the treasure or the","solution of the cryptogram? Would the first satisfy you without the\nsecond? The plot is worthy of careful study. Consider the following\npoints, for example: the significance of the chilly day, how\nLieutenant G---- affects the course of events, the incident of the dog\nrushing in, the effect of introducing the gold-bug and making it the\ntitle of the story. If Poe's purpose was to make a story of\r\ncryptography, think of some of the innumerable plots he might have\nused, and see what you think of the effectiveness of the one chosen.\n\n120. Quotation. Arthur Murphy (1727-1805), an English actor and\nplaywright, wrote a comedy called \"All in the Wrong,\" but Professor\nW.P. Trent, who examined the play, failed to find Poe's quotation.\n\n\n120. 15. Poe, while serving in the army, was stationed at Fort\r\nMoultrie, and should have known the region well, but his description\nis said to be inaccurate.\n\n121. 11. Jan Swammerdamm (1637-1680), a Dutch naturalist, who\ndevoted most of his time to the study of insects.\n\n122. 7. scarabæus: Latin for \"beetle,\" and the scientific term in\nentomology. While there are various golden beetles, Poe's was a\ncreation of his own.\n\n122. 26. This is one of the early attempts to use negro dialect. Poe's\r\nefforts are rather clumsy, considering his long residence in the\nSouth.  The reader will notice a number of improbable expressions of\nJupiter's, introduced for humorous effect, but the general character\nof the old negro is portrayed, in the main, very well.\n\n124. 5. scarabæus caput bominis: man's-head beetle.\n\n127. 17. brusquerie: brusqueness, abruptness.\n\n127. 20. solus: Latin for \"alone.\"  The Latin word is\r\naltogether unnecessary. Poe was often rather affected in the use of\nforeign words and phrases.\n\n128. 22. empressement:  French for \"eagerness,\" cordiality.\n\n132. 31. Liriodendron Tulipifera: the scientific name for the\ntulip tree, which sometimes attains a height of 140 feet and a\ndiameter of 9 feet.\n\n138. 25-26. curvets and caracoles: rare terms belonging to\nhorsemanship; the first is a low leap, the second a sudden wheel.","142. 13. counters: pieces of money, coins; or the meaning may\nbe imitation coins for reckoning or for counting in games.\n\n142. 16. No American money.  Why?\n\n142. 31. Bacchanalian figures: figures dancing and drinking\nwine at a celebration of the worship of Bacchus, god of wine.\n\n143. 29. parchment. What is the difference?\n\n\n147. 20. aqua regia: \"royal water,\" so called because it\r\ndissolves gold, is a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids.\n\n150. 15. Golconda: a ruined city of India, once famous as a\nplace for the cutting and polishing of diamonds; used figuratively in\nthe sense of a mine of wealth.\n\n150. 30. Read Poe's article on \"Cryptography,\" included in his\ncollected works.\n\n151. 13. Spanish main: that part of the Caribbean Sea adjacent\nto the coast of South America. It was part of the route of Spanish\r\nmerchant vessels between Spain and her new-world possessions, and was\ninfested with pirates.\n\n\nTHE PURLOINED LETTER (Page 160)\n\nFirst published in 1845 (see comment on the detective stories in the\nIntroduction, page xxviii). This story is peculiarly original in its\nincidents and subtle in its reasoning. \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\"\nshould certainly be read also, and perhaps it will prove of more\nsustained interest to the majority of readers.\n\n160. Quotation. Lucius Annæus Seneca (B.C. 4-A.D. 65) was a\ncelebrated Roman philosopher and tutor of the Emperor Nero. The\nquotation means: \"Nothing is more hateful to wisdom than excessive\nacumen.\"\n\n160. 3. Dupin: introduced in \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue.\"\n\n160. 4-5. Au troisième: French, literally, \"on the third,\" but\r\nthe meaning is the fourth floor, because the count is begun above the\nground floor; Faubourg St. Germain: an aristocratic section of\nParis.\n\n160. 15-16. Monsieur G----: introduced in \"The Murders in the\nRue Morgue.\"\n\n164. 3. Hotel: in French usage, a dwelling of some\npretension,--a mansion.\n\n164. 7. au fait: French for familiar, expert.\n\n168. 26. John Abernethy (1764-1831), an eminent English\nsurgeon, was noted for his brusque manners and his eccentricities.\n\n171. 15-16.  François, Due de la Rochefoucauld (1613-1680) was\na French moralist, author of the famous \"Maxims\"; Jean de la\nBruyère (1645-1696) was a French essayist; see notes on\nMachiavelli and Campanella under \"The Fall of the House\nof Usher,\" page 194.\n\n172. 19. recherché: French for \"sought after,\" selected with\ncare.","173. 1. non distributio medii: \"undistributed middle,\" a term\nin logic for a form of fallacious reasoning. Consult an encyclopedia,\narticles on \"Logic,\" \"Syllogism,\" and \"Fallacy,\" or the Century\nDictionary under \"Fallacy.\"\n\n173. 16. Nicholas Chamfort (1741-1794), a Frenchman, was said\nto be the best conversationalist of his day, and wrote famous maxims\nand epigrams. The quotation means, \"It is safe to wager that every\r\npopular idea, every received convention, is a piece of foolishness,\nbecause it has suited the majority.\"\n\n173. 27-28. ambitus: a going round, illegal striving for\noffice; religio: scrupulousness, conscientiousness; homines\nhonesti: men of distinction.\n\n174. 17. Jacob Bryant (1715-1804), an Englishman; his work on\nmythology is of no value.\n\n175. 5. intriguant: an intriguer.\n\n176. 3. vis inertiæ: force of inertia.\r\n180. 5. facilis descensus Averni: \"the descent to Avernus is\neasy.\"  Virgil's \"Aeneid,\" VI, 126; Cranch's translation, VI,\n161-162. Lake Avernus was, in classical mythology, the entrance to\nHades. Consult Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\"\n\n180. 6. Angelica Catalani (1780-1849), a famous Italian singer.\n\n180. 9. monstrum horrendum: a dreadful monster.\n\n180. 23-24. \"A design so baneful, if not worthy of Atreus, is worthy\nof Thyestes.\" Atreus and Thyestes were brothers to whom, in classic\nstory, the most terrible crimes were attributed.\n\n180. 25. Prosper J. de Crébillon (1674-1762), a noted French\ntragic poet. The quotation is from \"Atrée et Thyeste.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Selections from Poe, by J.

subject of so much controversy that he is\r\nthe one american writer whom highschool pupils not to mention\r\nteachers are likely to approach with readymade prejudices it is\r\nimpossible to treat such a subject in quite the ordinary\r\nmatterofcourse way furthermore his writings are so highly\r\nsubjective and so intimately connected with his strongly held\r\ncritical theories as to need somewhat careful and extended study\r\nthese facts make it very difficult to treat either the man or his art\r\nas simply as is desirable in a secondary textbook  consequently the\r\nintroduction is longer and less simple than the editor would desire\r\nfor the usual text it is believed however that the teacher can take\r\nup this introduction with the pupil in such a way as to make it\r\nhelpful

the most fascinating figure in\r\namerican literature his life touched by the extremes of fortune was\r\non the whole more unhappy than that of any other of our prominent men\r\nof letters his character was strangely complex and was the subject\r\nof misunderstanding during his life and of heated dispute after his\r\ndeath his writings were long neglected or disparaged at home while\r\naccepted abroad as our greatest literary achievement now after more\r\nthan half a century has elapsed since his death careful biographers\r\nhave furnished a tolerably full account of the real facts about his\r\nlife a fairly accurate idea of his character is winning general\r\nacceptance and the name of edgar allan poe has been conceded a place\r\namong the two or three greatest in our literature\r\n\r\n\r\nlife and character\r\n\r\nin december  a wellknown actress of the time died in richmond\r\nleaving destitute three little children the eldest but four years of\r\nage this mother who was elizabeth arnold poe daughter of an\r\nenglish actress had suffered from ill health for several years and\r\nhad long found the struggle for existence difficult her husband\r\ndavid poe probably died before her he was a son of general david\r\npoe a revolutionary veteran of baltimore and had left his home and\r\nlaw books for the stage several years before his marriage the second\r\nof the three children born january   in boston where his\r\nparents happened to be playing at the time was edgar poe the future\r\npoet and storywriter the little edgar was adopted by the wife of\r\nmr john allan a welltodo scotch merchant of the city who later\r\nbecame wealthy and the boy was thereafter known as edgar allan\r\npoe he was a beautiful and precocious child who at six years of age\r\ncould read draw dance and declaim the best poetry with fine effect\r\nand appreciation report says also that he had been taught to stand\r\non a chair and pledge mr allans guests in a glass of wine with\r\nroguish grace\r\n\r\nin  mr allan went to england where he remained five years edgar\r\nwas placed in an old english school in the suburbs of london among\r\nhistoric literary and antiquarian associations and possibly was\r\ntaken to the continent by his foster parents at vacation seasons the\r\nenglish residence and the sea voyages left deep impressions on the\r\nboys sensitive nature returning to richmond he was prepared in good\r\nschools for the university of virginia which he entered at the age of\r\nseventeen pursuing studies in ancient and modern languages and\r\nliteratures during this youthful period he was already developing a\r\nstriking and peculiar personality he was brilliant if not\r\nindustrious as a student leaving the university with highest honors\r\nin latin and french he was quick and nervous in his movements and\r\ngreatly excelled in athletics especially in swimming in character\r\nhe was reserved solitary sensitive and given to lonely reverie\r\nsome of his aristocratic playmates remembered to his discredit that he\r\nwas the child of strolling players and their attitude helped to add a\r\nstrain of defiance to an already intensely proud nature though kindly\r\ntreated by his foster parents this strange boy longed for an\r\nunderstanding sympathy that was not his once he thought he had found\r\nit in mrs jane stannard mother of a schoolmate but the new friend\r\nsoon died and for months the griefstricken boy it is said haunted\r\nthe lonely grave at night and brooded over his loss and the mystery of\r\ndeatha not very wholesome experience for a lonely and melancholy lad\r\nof fifteen years\r\n\r\nat the university he drank wine though not intemperately and played\r\ncards a great deal the end of the term finding him with gambling\r\ndebts of twentyfive hundred dollars these habits were common at the\r\ntime and edgar did not incur any censure from the faculty but\r\nmr allan declined to honor the gambling debt removed edgar and\r\nplaced him in his own counting room such a life was too dull for the\r\nhighspirited poetic youth and he promptly left his home\r\n\r\ngoing to boston he published a thin volume of boyish verse\r\ntamerlane and other poems but realizing nothing financially he\r\nenlisted in the united states army as edgar a perry after two years\r\nof faithful and efficient service he procured through mr allan who\r\nwas temporarily reconciled to him an appointment to the west point\r\nmilitary academy entering in july  in the meantime he had\r\npublished in baltimore a second small volume of poems fellowstudents\r\nhave described him as having a worn weary discontented look\r\nusually kindly and courteous but shy reserved and exceedingly\r\nsensitive an extraordinary reader but noted for carping criticism\r\nalthough a good student he seemed galled beyond endurance by the\r\nmonotonous routine of military duties which he deliberately neglected\r\nand thus procured his dismissal from the academy he left alone and\r\npenniless in march \r\n\r\nfootnote  in november  a single copy of this little volume\r\nsold in new york for $\r\n\r\ngoing to new york poe brought out another little volume of poems\r\nshowing great improvement then he went to baltimore and after a\r\nprecarious struggle of a year or two turned to prose and while in\r\ngreat poverty won a prize of one hundred dollars from the baltimore\r\nsaturday visitor for his story the manuscript found in a\r\nbottle through john p kennedy one of the judges whose\r\nfriendship the povertystricken author gained he procured a good deal\r\nof hack work and finally an editorial position on the southern\r\nliterary messenger of richmond the salary was fair and better\r\nwas in sight yet poe was melancholy dissatisfied and miserable he\r\nwrote a pitiable letter to mr kennedy asking to be convinced that\r\nit is at all necessary to live\r\n\r\nfootnote  a wellknown marylander author of horseshoe robinson\r\nswallow barn rob of the bowl and other popular novels of the\r\nday and later secretary of the navy\r\n\r\nfor several years he had been making his home with an aunt mrs\r\nclemm and her daughter virginia a girl beautiful in character and\r\nperson but penniless and probably already a victim of the consumption\r\nthat was eventually to cause her death in  when she was only\r\nfourteen years old poe married his cousin to whom he was\r\npassionately attached his devotion to her lasted through life and\r\nthe tenderest affection existed between him and mrs clemm who was\r\nall a mother could have been to him so that the home life was always\r\nbeautiful in spirit however poor in material comfort\r\n\r\nin january  his connection with the messenger was\r\nsevered probably because of his occasional lapses from sobriety but\r\nhis unfortunate temperament and his restless ambition were doubtless\r\nfactors with some reputation as poet storywriter critic and\r\neditor poe removed to new york and a year later to philadelphia\r\nwhere he remained until   here he found miscellaneous literary\r\neditorial and hack work finally becoming editor of grahams\r\nmagazine which prospered greatly under his management increasing\r\nits circulation from eight thousand to forty thousand within a\r\nyear but poes restless spirit was dissatisfied he was intensely\r\nanxious to own a magazine for himself and had already made several\r\nunsuccessful efforts to obtain oneefforts which were to be repeated\r\nat intervals and with as little success until the day his death he\r\nvainly sought a government position that a livelihood might be\r\nassured while he carried out his literary plans finally he left\r\ngrahams doubtless because of personal peculiarities since\r\nhis occasional inebriety did not interfere with his work and there\r\nfollowed a period of wretched poverty broken once by the winning of a\r\nprize of one hundred dollars for the gold bug\r\n\r\nhe continued to be known as a reserved isolated dreamy man of\r\nhighstrung nerves proud spirit and fantastic moods with a\r\nhaunting sense of impending evil  his home was poor and simple but\r\nimpressed every visitor by its neatness and quiet refinement\r\nvirginia accomplished in music and languages was as devoted to her\r\nhusband as he was to her both were fond of flowers and plants and of\r\nhousehold pets mrs  clemm gave herself completely to her children\r\nand was the business manager of the family\r\n\r\nin the spring of  poe went with virginia to new york practically\r\npenniless and to mrs clemm who did not come at once he wrote with\r\npathetic enthusiasm of the generous meals served at their boarding\r\nhouse he obtained a position on the evening mirror at small\r\npay but did his dull work faithfully and efficiently later he\r\nbecame editor of the broadway journal in which he printed\r\nrevisions of his best tales and poems in  appeared the raven\r\nwhich created a profound sensation at home and abroad and immediately\r\nwon and has since retained an immense popularity he was at the\r\nheight of his fame but poor as always in  he published the\r\nliterati critical comments on the writers of the day in which the\r\nliterary small fry were mercilessly condemned and ridiculed this\r\nnaturally made poe a host of enemies one of these thomas dunn\r\nenglish published an abusive article attacking the authors\r\ncharacter whereupon poe sued him for libel and obtained two hundred\r\nand twentyfive dollars damages\r\n\r\nthe family now moved to a little threeroom cottage at fordham a\r\nquiet country place with flowers and trees and pleasant vistas but\r\nillness and poverty were soon there too  in  virginia had burst\r\na blood vessel while singing and her life was despaired of this had\r\nhappened again and again leaving her weaker each time as the summer\r\nand fall of this year wore away she grew worse and needed the\r\ntenderest care and attention but winter drew on and with it came\r\ncold and hunger the sick girl lay in an unheated room on a straw bed\r\nwrapped in her husbands coat the husband and mother trying to chafe\r\na little warmth into her hands and feet some kindhearted women\r\nrelieved the distress in a measure but on january   virginia\r\ndied the effect on poe was terrible it is easy to see how a very\r\nartist of death who could study the dreadful stages of its slow\r\napproach and seek to penetrate the mystery of its ultimate nature with\r\nsuch intense interest and deep reflection as did poe must have\r\nbrooded and suffered during the years of his wifes illness  his own\r\nhealth had long been poor his brain was diseased and insanity seemed\r\nimminent after intense grief came a period of settled gloom and\r\nhaunting fear the less than three years of life left for him was a\r\nperiod of decline in every respect but he remained in the little\r\ncottage finding some comfort in caring for his flowers and pets and\r\ntaking long solitary rambles during this time he thought out and\r\nwrote eureka a treatise on the structure laws and destiny of the\r\nuniverse which he desired to have regarded as a poem\r\n\r\npoe had always felt a need for the companionship of sympathetic and\r\naffectionate women for whom he entertained a chivalric regard\r\namounting to reverence after the shock of his wifes death had\r\nsomewhat worn away he began to depend for sympathy upon various women\r\nwith whom he maintained romantic friendships judged by ordinary\r\nstandards his conduct became at times little short of maudlin his\r\ncorrespondence showed a sort of gasping frantic dependence upon the\r\nsympathy and consolation of these women friends and exhibited a\r\npainful picture of a broken man mrs shew one of the kind women who\r\nhad relieved the family at the time of virginias last illness\r\nstrongly advised him to marry and he did propose marriage to\r\nmrs sara helen whitman a verse writer of some note in her day after\r\na wild and exhausting wooing begun in an extravagantly romantic\r\nmanner the match was broken off through the influence of the ladys\r\nfriends when it was all over poe seemed very little disturbed the\r\ntruth is he was a wreck and feeling utterly dependent clutched\r\nfrantically at every hope of sympathy and consolation his only real\r\nlove was for his dead wife which he recorded shortly before his death\r\nin the exquisite lyric annabel lee\r\n\r\nin july  full of the darkest forebodings and predicting that he\r\nshould never return poe went to richmond here he spent a few quiet\r\nmonths part of the time fairly cheerful but twice yielding to the\r\ntemptation to drink and each time suffering in consequence a\r\ndangerous illness on september  he left richmond for new york with\r\nfifteen hundred dollars the product of a recent lecture arranged by\r\nkind richmond friends what happened during the next three days is an\r\nimpenetrable mystery but on october  wednesday he was found in an\r\nelection booth in baltimore desperately ill his money and baggage\r\ngone the most probable story is that he had been drugged by political\r\nworkers imprisoned in a coop with similar victims and used as a\r\nrepeater  this procedure being a common one at the time whether\r\nhe was also intoxicated is a matter of doubt there could be but one\r\neffect on his delicate and already diseased brain he was taken to a\r\nhospital unconscious lingered several days in the delirium of a\r\nviolent brain fever and in the early dawn of sunday october \r\nbreathed his last\r\n\r\nfootnote  repeater a person who illegally votes more than once\r\n\r\nthe dead authors character immediately became the subject of violent\r\ncontroversy his severe critical strictures had made him many enemies\r\namong the minor writers of the day and their friends one of the men\r\nwho had suffered from poes too caustic pen was rufus w griswold but\r\nfriendly relations had been nominally established and poe had\r\nauthorized griswold to edit his works this griswold did including a\r\nbiography which poes friends declared a masterpiece of malicious\r\ndistortion and misrepresentation it certainly was grossly unfair and\r\ninaccurate poes friends retorted and a long war of words followed\r\nin which hatred or prejudice on the one side and wholesale\r\nundiscriminating laudation on the other alike tended to obscure the\r\ntruth it is now almost impossible to see the real poe just as he\r\nappeared to an ordinary unprejudiced observer of his own time only\r\nby the most careful thoughtful and sympathetic study can we hope to\r\napproximate such an acquaintance\r\n\r\nthe fundamental fact about poe is a very peculiar and unhappy\r\ntemperament certain characteristic qualities of which began to\r\ndisclose themselves in early boyhood and fostered by the vicissitudes\r\nof his career developed throughout his life\r\n\r\nin youth he was nervous sensitive morbid proud solitary and\r\nwayward and as the years went by bringing poverty illness and the\r\nbitterness of failure often through his own faults the man became\r\nirritable impatient often morose he had always suffered from fits\r\nof depressionblue devils mr  kennedy called themand though\r\nhe was extravagantly sanguine at times melancholy was his usual mood\r\noften manifesting itself in a haunting fear of evil to come the\r\npeculiar character of his wonderful imagination made actual life less\r\nreal to him than his own land of dreams the distant aidenn the\r\ndim lake of auber the kingdom by the sea seemed more genuine\r\nthan the landscapes of earth the lurid city in the sea more\r\nsubstantial than the streets he daily walked\r\n\r\nbecause of this intensely subjective and selfabsorbed character of\r\nmind he had no understanding of human nature no insight into\r\ncharacter with its marvelous complexities and contradictions with\r\nthese limitations poe as might be expected had a very defective\r\nsense of humor lacked true sympathy was tactless possessed little\r\nbusiness ability and was excessively annoyed by the dull routine and\r\nrude frictions of ordinary life he was always touched by kindness\r\nbut was quick to resent an injury and even as a boy could not endure\r\na jest at his expense he had many warm and devoted friends whom he\r\nloved in return but the limitations of his own nature probably made a\r\nreally frank unreserved friendship impossible and when a break\r\noccurred he was apt to assume that his former friend was an utter\r\nvillain these personal characteristics in conjunction with a goading\r\nambition which took form in the idea of an independent journal of his\r\nown in which he might find untrammeled expression added uneasiness\r\nand restlessness to a constantly discontented nature to some extent\r\nat least poe realized the curse of such a temperament but he strove\r\nvainly against its impulses\r\n\r\nthe one genuine human happiness of this sad life was found in a\r\nsingularly beautiful home atmosphere husband and wife were\r\npassionately devoted to each other and mrs clemm was more than a\r\nmother to both she says of her soninlaw at home he was simple\r\nand affectionate as a child and during all the years he lived with\r\nme i do not remember a single night that he failed to come and kiss\r\nhis mother as he called me before going to bed this faithful\r\nwoman remained devoted to him after virginias death and to his\r\nmemory when calumny assailed it after his own\r\n\r\nthe capital charge against poes character has been intemperance and\r\nalthough the matter has been grossly exaggerated and misrepresented\r\nthe charge is true except for short periods he was never what is\r\nknown as dissipated and he struggled desperately against his\r\nweaknessan unequal struggle since the craving was inherited and\r\nfostered by environment circumstances and temperament one of his\r\nbiographers tells of bread soaked in gin being fed to the little poe\r\nchildren by an old nurse during the illness of their mother and there\r\nis another story already mentioned of the little edgar in his\r\nadoptive home taught to pledge the guests as a social grace\r\ndrinking was common at the time wine was offered in every home and at\r\nevery social function and in the south where poe spent his youth and\r\nearly manhood the spirit of hospitality and conviviality held out\r\nconstant temptation to his delicate organization strong drink early\r\nbecame a veritable poison and indulgence that would have been a small\r\nmatter to another man was ruinous to him indeed a single glass of\r\nwine drove him practically insane and a debauch was sure to\r\nfollow indulgence was stimulated also by the nervous strain and\r\nworry induced by uncertain livelihood and privation the frequent fits\r\nof depression and by constant brooding sometimes he fought his\r\nweakness successfully for several years but always it conquered in\r\nthe end\r\n\r\nmoreover he speaks of a very special cause in the latter part of his\r\nlife which in fairness should be heard in his own written words to a\r\nfriend six years ago a wife whom i loved as no man ever loved\r\nbefore ruptured a blood vessel in singing her life was despaired\r\nof i took leave of her forever and underwent all the agonies of her\r\ndeath she recovered partially and i again hoped at the end of a year\r\nthe vessel broke again i went through precisely the same scene\r\nthen againagainand even once again at varying intervals each\r\ntime i felt all the agonies of her deathand at each accession of her\r\ndisorder i loved her more dearly and clung to her life with more\r\ndesperate pertinacity but i am constitutionally sensitivenervous in\r\na very unusual degree  i became insane with long intervals of\r\nhorrible sanity during these fits of absolute unconsciousness i\r\ndrankgod only knows how often or how much as a matter of course my\r\nenemies referred the insanity to the drink rather than the drink to\r\nthe insanity it was the horrible neverending oscillation between\r\nhope and despair which i could not longer have endured without\r\ntotal loss of reason in the death of what was my life then i\r\nreceived a new buto godhow melancholy an existence\r\n\r\nthis statement and the other facts mentioned are not offered as\r\nwholly excusing poe doubtless a stronger man would have resisted\r\ndoubtless a less selfabsorbed man would have thought of his wifes\r\nhappiness as well as of his own relief from torture yet the\r\nfairminded person familiar with poes unhappy life and keeping in\r\nmind the influences of heredity temperament and environment will\r\nhesitate to pronounce a severe judgment\r\n\r\npoe was also accused of untruthfulness and this accusation likewise\r\nhas a basis of fact he repeatedly furnished or approved statements\r\nregarding his life and work that were incorrect he often made a\r\ndisingenuous show of pretended learning and he sometimes misstated\r\nfacts to avoid wounding his own vanity this ugly fault seems to have\r\nresulted from a fondness for romantic posing and is doubtless related\r\nto the peculiar character of imagination already mentioned perhaps\r\ntoo he inherited from his actor parents a love of applause and if\r\nso the trait was certainly encouraged in early childhood  there is\r\nno evidence that he was ever guilty of malicious or mercenary\r\nfalsehood\r\n\r\nanother of his bad habits was borrowing but it must be remembered\r\nthat his life was one long struggle with grinding poverty that he and\r\nthose dear to him sometimes suffered actual hunger and cold many who\r\nknew him testified to his anxiety to pay all his debts mr graham\r\nreferring to him in this particular as the soul of honor\r\n\r\nin a letter to lowell poe has well described himself in a sentence\r\nmy life has been whimimpulsepassiona longing for solitudea\r\nscorn of all things present in an earnest desire for the future\r\ninterpreted this means that in a sense he never really reached\r\nmaturity that he remained a slave to his impulses and emotions that\r\nhe detested the ordinary business of life and could not adapt himself\r\nto it that his mind was full of dreams of ideal beauty and\r\nperfection that his whole soul yearned to attain the highest\r\npleasures of artistic creation his was perpetually a deeply agitated\r\nsoul as such it was natural he should outwardly seem irritable\r\nimpatient restless discontented and solitary it is impossible to\r\nbelieve that there was any strain of real evil in poe a man who could\r\ninspire such devotion as he had from such a woman as mrs clemm a man\r\nwho loved flowers and children and animal pets who could be so\r\ndevoted a husband who could so consecrate himself to art was not a\r\nbad man yet his acts were often as we have seen most\r\nreprehensible frequently the subject of slander he was not a victim\r\nof conspiracy to defame although circumstances were many times\r\nagainst him he was his own worst enemy he was cursed with a\r\ntemperament his mind was analytical and imaginative and gave no\r\nthought to the ethical he remained wayward as a child the man like\r\nhis art was not immoral but simply unmoral whatever his faults he\r\nsuffered frightfully for them and his fame suffered after him\r\n\r\n\r\nliterary work\r\n\r\npoes first literary ventures were in verse the early volumes\r\nshowing strongly the influence of byron and moore were productions of\r\nsmall merit but large promise their author was soon to become one of\r\nthe most original of poets his later work being unique with a\r\nstrangely individual poe atmosphere that no other writer has ever\r\nbeen able successfully to imitate his verse is individual in theme\r\ntreatment and structure all of which harmonize with his conscious\r\ntheory of poetic art his theory is briefly this it is not the\r\nfunction of poetry to teach either truth or morals but to gratify\r\nthrough novel forms the thirst for supernal beauty its proper\r\neffect is to excite by elevating the soul the highest beauty has\r\nalways some admixture of sadness the most poetical of all themes\r\nbeing the death of a beautiful woman moreover the pleasure derived\r\nfrom the contemplation of this higher beauty should be indefinite\r\nthat is true poetic feeling is not the result of coherent narrative\r\nor clear pictures or fine moral sentiment but consists in vague\r\nexalted emotion music of all the arts produces the vaguest and most\r\nindefinite pleasure consequently verse forms should be chosen with\r\nthe greatest possible attention to musical effect poetry must be\r\npurely a matter of feeling its sole arbiter is taste with the\r\nintellect or with the conscience it has only collateral relations\r\n\r\nthis explanation is necessary because the stock criticism of poes\r\npoetry condemns it as vague indefinite and devoid of thought or\r\nethical content these are precisely its limitations but hardly its\r\nfaults since the poet attained with marvelous art the very effects he\r\ndesired the themes of nearly all the poems are death ruin regret\r\nor failure the verse is original in form and among the most musical\r\nin the language full of a haunting almost magical melody mystery\r\nsymbolism shadowy suggestion fugitive thought elusive beauty\r\nbeings that are mere insubstantial abstractionsthese are the\r\ncharacteristics but designedly so of poes poetry a poem to him was\r\nsimply a crystallized mood and it is futile for his readers to apply\r\nany other test yet the influence of this verse has been wide and\r\nimportant extending to most lyric poets of the last halfcentury\r\nincluding such masters as rossetti and swinburne\r\n\r\nto helen a poem of three brief stanzas is poes first really\r\nnotable production it is an exquisite tribute of his reverent\r\ndevotion to his boyhood friend mrs stannard portraying her as a\r\nclassic embodiment of beauty israfel is a lyric of aspiration of\r\nrare power and rapture worthy of shelley and is withal the most\r\nspontaneous simple and genuinely human poem poe ever wrote the\r\nhaunted palace one of the finest of his poems is an unequaled\r\nallegory of the wreck and ruin of sovereign reason which to be fully\r\nappreciated should be read in its somber setting the fall of the\r\nhouse of usher less attractive is the conqueror worm with its\r\nrepulsive imagery but this tragedy man with the universe as a\r\ntheater moving to the music of the spheres and horror the soul of\r\nthe plot is undeniably powerful and intensely terrible\r\n\r\nthe raven published in  attained immediately a worldwide\r\ncelebrity and rivals in fame and popularity any lyric ever written\r\nit is the most elaborate treatment of poes favorite theme the death\r\nof a beautiful woman the reveries of a bereaved lover alone in his\r\nlibrary at midnight in the bleak december vainly seeking to forget\r\nhis sorrow for the lost lenore are interrupted by a tapping as of\r\nsome one desirous to enter after a time he admits a stately raven\r\nand seeks to beguile his sad fancy by putting questions to the bird\r\nwhose one reply is nevermore and this constitutes the refrain of\r\nthe poem impelled by an instinct of selftorture the lover asks\r\nwhether he shall have respite from the painful memories of lenore\r\nhere or hereafter and finally whether in the distant aidenn he and\r\nhis love shall be reunited to all of which the raven returns his one\r\nanswer driven to frenzy the lover implores the bird take thy beak\r\nfrom out my heart and take thy form from off my door only to learn\r\nthat the shadow will be lifted nevermore the raven is in the\r\npoets own words emblematical of mournful and neverending\r\nremembrance\r\n\r\nulalume has been commonly though not always regarded as a mere\r\nexperiment in verbal ingenuity meaningless melody or the insanity\r\nof versification as a distinguished american critic has called\r\nit such a judgment is a mark of inability to understand poes most\r\ncharacteristic work for in truth ulalume is the extreme expression\r\nat once of his critical theory and of his peculiar genius as a\r\npoet it was published in december of the same year in which virginia\r\ndied in january the poets condition has already been described\r\nulalume is a marvelous expression of his mood at this time  it\r\ndepicts a soul worn out by long suffering groping for courage and\r\nhope only to return again to the door of a legended tomb it is\r\ntrue the movement is slow impeded by the frequent repetitions but so\r\nthe wearied mind after nervous exhaustion is palsied and sere\r\nthere is no appeal to the intellect but this is characteristic of poe\r\nand appropriate to a mind numbed by protracted suffering it is this\r\nmood of wearied benumbed discouraged hopeless hope feebly seeking\r\nfor the lethean peace of the skies only to find the mind inevitably\r\nreverting to the lost ulalume that finds expression there is no\r\ndefinite thought because only the communication of feeling is\r\nintended there is no distinct setting because the whole action is\r\nspiritual the dim lake and dark tarn of auber the ghoulhaunted\r\nwoodland of weir the alley titanic of cypress are the\r\ngriefstricken and fearhaunted places of the poets own darkened\r\nmind while the ashen skies of the lonesome october are significant\r\nenough of this most immemorial year the poem is a monody of\r\nnerveless exhausted grief as such it must be read to be appreciated\r\nas such it must be judged and so appreciated and so judged it is\r\nabsolutely unique and incomparable\r\n\r\nabout a year later came the bells wonderful for the music of its\r\nverse and the finest onomatopoetic poem in the language two days\r\nafter poes death appeared annabel lee a simple sincere and\r\nbeautiful ballad a tribute to his dead wife last of all was printed\r\nthe brief eldorado a fitting deathsong for poe in which a gallant\r\nknight sets out singing a song in search of eldorado only to\r\nlearn when youth and strength are gone that he must seek his goal\r\ndown the valley of the shadow\r\n\r\nthe tales like the poems are a real contribution to the worlds\r\nliterature but more strikingly so since the type itself is\r\noriginal poe hawthorne and irving are distinctly the pioneers in\r\nthe production of the modern short story and neither has been\r\nsurpassed on his own ground but poe has been vastly the greater\r\ninfluence in foreign countries especially in france poe formed a new\r\nconception of the short story one which professor brander matthews\r\nhas treated formally and explicitly as a distinct literary form\r\ndifferent from the story that is merely short without calling it a\r\ndistinct form poe implied the idea in a review of hawthornes\r\ntwicetold tales\r\n\r\nfootnote  the philosophy of the shortstory chapter iv of pen\r\nand ink\r\n\r\nthe ordinary novel is objectionable from its length as it cannot\r\nbe read at one sitting it deprives itself of course of the immense\r\nforce derivable from totality in the brief tale however\r\nthe author is enabled to carry out the fulness of his intention be it\r\nwhat it may during the hour of perusal the soul of the reader is at\r\nthe writers control\r\n\r\na skillful literary artist has constructed a tale if wise he has not\r\nfashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents but having\r\nconceived with deliberate care a certain unique or single\r\neffect to be wrought out he then invents such incidentshe\r\nthen combines such events as may best aid him in establishing this\r\npreconceived effect if his very initial sentence tend not to the\r\noutbringing of this effect then he has failed in his first step in\r\nthe whole composition there should be no word written of which the\r\ntendency direct or indirect is not to the one preëstablished design\r\n\r\nthis idea of a short story should be kept in mind in reading poes\r\nworks for he applied his theory perfectly\r\n\r\nthe stories are of greater variety than the poems there are romances\r\nof death whose themes are fear horror madness catalepsy premature\r\nburial torture mesmerism and revengeful cruelty tales of weird\r\nbeauty allegories of conscience narratives of pseudoscience\r\nstories of analytical reasoning descriptions of beautiful landscapes\r\nand what are usually termed prose poems he also wrote tales\r\ngrotesque humorous and satirical most of which are failures the\r\nearlier tales are predominantly imaginative and emotional most of the\r\nlater ones are predominantly intellectual none of the tales touches\r\nordinary healthy life there is scarcely a suggestion of local color\r\nthe humor is nearly always mechanical there is little conversation\r\nand the characters are never normal human beings although the stories\r\nare strongly romantic in subject plot and setting there is an\r\nextraordinary realism in treatment a minuteness and accuracy of\r\ndetail equaling the work of defoe  this is one secret of the magical\r\nart that not only transports us to the world of dream and vision where\r\nthe authors own soul roamed but for the time makes it all real to\r\nus\r\n\r\npoes finest tale as a work of art is the fall of the house of\r\nusher which is as nearly perfect in its craftsmanship as human work\r\nmay be it is a romance of death with a setting of profound gloom and\r\nis wrought out as a highly imaginative study in feara symphony in\r\nwhich every touch blends into a perfect unity of effect ligeia\r\nperhaps standing next incorporating the conqueror worm as its\r\nkeynote portrays the terrific struggle of a womans will against\r\ndeath  the masque of the red death a tale of the spirit of\r\npestilence and of death victorious over human selfishness and power\r\nis a splendid study in somber color the assignation a romance of\r\nvenice is also splendid in coloring and rich in decorative effects\r\npresenting a luxury of sorrow culminating in romantic suicide\r\nwilliam wilson is an allegory of conscience personified in a double\r\nthe forerunner of stevensons dr jekyll and mr hyde other\r\nconscience stories are the man of the crowd the telltale heart\r\nalso depicting insanity and the black cat of which the atmosphere\r\nis horror the adventures of one hans pfaal and the balloon hoax\r\nare examples of the pseudoscientific tales which attain their\r\nverisimilitude by diverting attention from the improbability or\r\nimpossibility of the general incidents to the accuracy and naturalness\r\nof details in the descent into the maëlstrom scientific reasoning\r\nis skillfully blended with imaginative strength poetic description\r\nand stirring adventure this type of story is clearly enough the\r\noriginal of those of jules verne and similar writers the murders in\r\nthe rue morgue and the purloined letter are the pioneer detective\r\nstories dupin the original sherlock holmes and they remain the best\r\nof their kind unsurpassed in originality ingenuity and\r\nplausibility another type of the story of analytical reasoning is\r\nthe goldbug built around the solution of a cryptogram but also\r\nintroducing an element of adventure poes analytical power was real\r\nnot a trick if he made legrand solve the cryptogram and boast his\r\nability to solve others more difficult poe himself solved scores sent\r\nhim in response to a public magazine challenge if dupin solved\r\nmysteries that poe invented for him poe himself wrote in marie\r\nroget from newspaper accounts the solution of a real murder\r\nmystery and astounded dickens by outlining the entire plot of\r\nbarnaby rudge when only a few of the first chapters had been\r\npublished if he wrote imaginatively of science he in fact\r\ndemonstrated in maelzels chess player that a pretended automaton\r\nwas operated by a man hop frog and the cask of amontillado are\r\noldworld stories of revenge the island of the fay and the domain\r\nof arnheim are landscape studies the one of calm loveliness the\r\nother of oriental profusion and coloring shadow and silence are\r\ncommonly classed as prose poems the former being one of poes most\r\neffective productions eleonora besides having a story to tell is\r\nboth a prose poem and a landscape study and withal one of poes most\r\nexquisite writings\r\n\r\nalthough poe was not a great critic his critical work is by no means\r\nvalueless he applied for the first time in america a thoroughgoing\r\nscrutiny and able fearless criticism to contemporary literature\r\nundoubtedly with good effect his attacks on didacticism were\r\nespecially valuable his strength as a critic lay in his artistic\r\ntemperament and in the incisive intellect that enabled him to analyze\r\nthe effects produced in his own creations and in those of others his\r\nweaknesses were extravagance a mania for harping on plagiarism lack\r\nof spiritual insight broad sympathies and profound scholarship and\r\nin general the narrow range of his genius which has already been\r\nmade sufficiently clear his severity has been exaggerated as he\r\noften praised highly probably erring more frequently by undue\r\nlaudation than by extreme severity though personal prejudice\r\nsometimes crept into his work especially in favor of women yet on\r\nthe whole he was as fair and fearless as he claimed to be much of the\r\nhasty journalistic hack work is valueless as might be expected but\r\nhe wrote very suggestively of his art and nearly all his judgments\r\nhave been sustained moreover he met one supreme test of a critic in\r\nrecognizing unknown genius dickens he was among the first to appraise\r\nas a great novelist tennyson and elizabeth barrett browning he\r\nranked among the great poets without hesitation and at home he early\r\nexpressed a due appreciation of hawthorne lowell longfellow and\r\nbryant\r\n\r\npoes place both in prose and poetry is assured his recognition\r\nabroad has been clear and emphatic from the first especially in\r\nfrance and today foreigners generally regard him as the greatest\r\nwriter we have produced an opinion in which a number of our own\r\ncritics and readers concur ones judgment in the matter will depend\r\nupon the point of view and the standards adopted it is too large a\r\nsubject to consider here but if artistic craftsmanship be the\r\nstandard certainly hawthorne would be his only rival and hawthorne\r\nwas not also a poet  the question of exact relative rank however it\r\nis neither possible nor important to settle it is sufficient to say\r\nin the words of professor woodberry on the roll of our literature\r\npoes name is inscribed among the few foremost and in the world at\r\nlarge his genius is established as valid among all men\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbibliography\r\n\r\nthe year after poes death there appeared the works of the late edgar\r\nallan poe with a memoir in two volumes edited by r w griswold\r\nand published by j s redfield new york the same editor and\r\npublisher brought out a fourvolume edition in  griswold had\r\nsuffered from poes sharp criticisms and had quarreled with him\r\nthough later there was a reconciliation and poe himself selected\r\ngriswold to edit his works the biographer painted the dead author\r\nvery black indeed and his account is now generally considered unfair\r\n\r\nin  the works of edgar allan poe with memoir edited by\r\njohn h ingram were published in four volumes in edinburgh and in\r\n in new york ingram represents the other extreme from griswold\r\nattempting to defend practically everything that poe was and did\r\n\r\nin  a c armstrong  son new york brought

griswolds editing was poor subsequent editions followed his\r\nuntil  when professor george e woodberry and mr edmund clarence\r\nstedman published a new edition in ten volumes through stone

harrisons biography written for the virginia\r\nedition is published separately by ty crowell  company it is very\r\nfull and valuable for the mass of material supplied but is not\r\ndiscriminating in criticism or estimate of poes character\r\n\r\nnumerous magazine articles may be found by consulting the periodical\r\nindexes a number of suggestive short studies are to be found in the\r\ntextbooks of american literature such as those of messrs trent\r\nabernethy newcomer and wendell and in the larger books of\r\nprofessors richardson trent and wendell one may also find acute and\r\nvaluable

                   \r\nfrom this ultimate dim thule\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe raven\r\n\r\n\r\nonce upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary\r\nover many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore\r\nwhile i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping\r\nas of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door\r\ntis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door                  \r\n          only this and nothing more\r\n\r\nah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december\r\nand each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor\r\neagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow\r\nfrom my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore                 \r\nfor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore\r\n          nameless here forevermore\r\n\r\nand the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\r\nthrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before\r\nso that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating              \r\nt is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door\r\nsome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door\r\n          this it is and nothing more\r\n\r\npresently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer\r\nsir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore                   \r\nbut the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping\r\nand so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door\r\nthat i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door\r\n          darkness there and nothing more\r\n\r\ndeep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing       \r\ndoubting dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before\r\nbut the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token\r\nand the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore\r\nthis i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore\r\n          merely this and nothing more                                       \r\n\r\nback into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning\r\nsoon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before\r\nsurely said i surely that is something at my window lattice\r\nlet me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore\r\nlet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore                      \r\n          t is the wind and nothing more\r\n\r\nopen here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter\r\nin there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore\r\nnot the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he\r\nbut with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door                \r\nperched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door\r\n          perched and sat and nothing more\r\n\r\nthen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling\r\nby the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore\r\nthough thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven    \r\nghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore\r\ntell me what thy lordly name is on the  nights plutonian shore\r\n          quoth the raven nevermore\r\n\r\nmuch i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly\r\nthough its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore                      \r\nfor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\never yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door\r\nbird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door\r\n          with such name as nevermore\r\n\r\nbut the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only                  \r\nthat one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour\r\nnothing further then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered\r\ntill i scarcely more than mutteredother friends have flown before\r\non the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before\r\n          then the bird said nevermore                                    \r\n\r\nstartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken\r\ndoubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store\r\ncaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster\r\nfollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore\r\ntill the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore                       \r\n          of nevernevermore\r\n\r\nbut the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling\r\nstraight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door\r\nthen upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking\r\nfancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore                    \r\nwhat this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore\r\n          meant in croaking nevermore\r\n\r\nthis i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing\r\nto the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core\r\nthis and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining                  \r\non the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer\r\nbut whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer\r\n          she shall press ah nevermore\r\n\r\nthen methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer\r\nswung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor               \r\nwretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent thee\r\nrespiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore\r\nquaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore\r\n          quoth the raven nevermore\r\n\r\nprophet said i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil           \r\nwhether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore\r\ndesolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted\r\non this home by horror hauntedtell me truly i implore\r\nis thereis there balm in gileadtell metell me i implore\r\n          quoth the raven nevermore                                       \r\n\r\nprophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil\r\nby that heaven that bends above us by that god we both adore\r\ntell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn\r\nit shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore\r\nclasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore                 \r\n          quoth the raven nevermore\r\n\r\nbe that word our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting\r\nget thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore\r\nleave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken\r\nleave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my door                   \r\ntake thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door\r\n          quoth the raven nevermore\r\n\r\nand the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting\r\non the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door\r\nand his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming             \r\nand the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor\r\nand my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n          shall be liftednevermore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neulalie\r\n\r\n\r\ni dwelt alone\r\nin a world of moan\r\nand my soul was a stagnant tide\r\ntill the

     \r\nit was hard by the dim lake of auber\r\n  in the misty mid region of weir\r\nit was down by the dank tarn of auber\r\n  in the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir\r\n\r\nhere once through an alley

the boreal pole\r\n\r\nour talk had been serious and sober                       \r\n  but our thoughts they were palsied and sere\r\n  our memories were treacherous and sere\r\nfor we knew not the month was october\r\n  and we marked not the night of the year\r\n  ah night of all nights in the year                   \r\nwe noted not the dim lake of auber\r\n  though once we had journeyed down here\r\nremembered not the dank tarn of auber\r\n  nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir\r\n\r\nand now as the night was senescent                        \r\n  and stardials pointed to morn\r\n  as the stardials hinted of morn\r\nat the end of our path a liquescent\r\n  and nebulous lustre was born\r\nout of which a miraculous crescent                         \r\n  arose with a duplicate

region of sighs\r\nshe has seen that the tears are not dry on\r\n  these cheeks where the worm never dies\r\nand has come past the stars of the lion\r\n  to point us the path to the skies                       \r\n  to the lethean peace of the skies\r\ncome up in despite of the lion\r\n  to shine on us with her bright eyes\r\ncome up through the lair of the lion\r\n  with love in her luminous eyes

sorrowfully trailed in the dust               \r\n\r\ni repliedthis is nothing but dreaming\r\n  let us on by this tremulous light\r\n  let us bathe in this crystalline light\r\nits sibyllic splendor

her\r\n  and tempted her out of her gloom\r\n  and conquered her scruples and gloom\r\nand we passed to the end of the vista                     \r\n  but were stopped by the door of a tomb\r\n  by the door of a legended tomb\r\nand i saidwhat is written sweet sister\r\n  on the door of this legended tomb\r\n  she repliedulalumeulalume                         \r\n  t is the vault of thy lost

know\r\n  by the name of annabel lee\r\nand this maiden she lived with no other thought             \r\n  than to love and be loved by me\r\n\r\ni was a child and she was a child\r\n  in this kingdom by the sea\r\nbut we loved with a love that was more than love\r\n  i and my annabel lee                                    \r\nwith a love that the winged seraphs of heaven\r\n  coveted her and me\r\n\r\nand this was the reason that long ago\r\n  in this kingdom by the sea\r\na wind blew out of a cloud chilling                       \r\n  my beautiful annabel lee\r\nso that her highborn kinsmen came\r\n  and bore her away from me\r\nto shut her up in a sepulchre\r\n  in this kingdom by the sea                              \r\n\r\nthe angels not half so happy in heaven\r\n  went envying her and me\r\nyes that was the reason as all men know\r\n  in this kingdom by the sea\r\nthat the wind came out of the cloud by night              \r\n  chilling and killing my annabel lee\r\n\r\nbut our love it was stronger by far than the love\r\n  of those who were older than we\r\n  of many far wiser than we\r\nand neither the angels in heaven above                    \r\n  nor the demons down under the sea\r\ncan ever dissever my soul from the soul\r\n  of the beautiful annabel lee\r\n\r\nfor the moon never beams without bringing me dreams\r\n  of the beautiful annabel lee                            \r\nand the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes\r\n  of the beautiful annabel lee\r\nand so all the nighttide i lie down by the side\r\nof my darlingmy darlingmy life and my bride\r\n  in her sepulchre there by the sea                       \r\n  in her tomb by the sounding sea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto my mother\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause i feel that in the heavens above\r\n  the angels whispering to one another\r\ncan find among their burning terms of love\r\n  none so devotional as that of mother\r\ntherefore by that dear name i long have called you        \r\n  you who are more than mother unto me\r\nand fill my heart of hearts where death installed you\r\n  in setting my virginias spirit free\r\nmy mother my own mother who died early\r\n  was but the mother of myself but you                    \r\nare mother to the one i loved so dearly\r\n  and thus are dearer than the mother i knew\r\nby that infinity with which my wife\r\nwas dearer to my soul than its

béranger\r\n\r\n\r\nduring the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn of\r\nthe year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens i had\r\nbeen passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract of\r\ncountry and at length found myself as the shades of the evening drew\r\non within view of the melancholy house of usher i know not how it\r\nwasbut with the first glimpse of the building a sense of\r\ninsufferable gloom pervaded my spirit i say insufferable for the\r\nfeeling was unrelieved by any of that halfpleasurable because\r\npoetic sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the\r\nsternest natural images of the desolate or terrible  i looked upon\r\nthe scene before meupon the mere house and the simple landscape\r\nfeatures of the domain upon the bleak walls upon the vacant eyelike\r\nwindows upon a few rank sedges and upon a few white trunks of\r\ndecayed treeswith an utter depression of soul which i can compare to\r\nno earthly sensation more properly than to the afterdream of the\r\nreveller upon opium the bitter lapse into everyday life the hideous\r\ndropping off of the veil  there was an iciness a sinking a\r\nsickening of the heart an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no\r\ngoading of the imagination could torture into aught of the\r\nsublime what was iti paused to thinkwhat was it that so unnerved\r\nme in the contemplation of the house of usher it was a mystery all\r\ninsoluble nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded\r\nupon me as i pondered  i was forced to fall back upon the\r\nunsatisfactory conclusion that while beyond doubt there are\r\ncombinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of\r\nthus affecting us still the analysis of this power lies among\r\nconsiderations beyond our depth it was possible i reflected that a\r\nmere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene of the\r\ndetails of the picture would be sufficient to modify or perhaps to\r\nannihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression and acting upon\r\nthis idea i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and\r\nlurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling and gazed\r\ndownbut with a shudder even more thrilling than beforeupon the\r\nremodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge and the ghastly\r\ntreestems and the vacant and eyelike windows\r\n\r\nnevertheless in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a\r\nsojourn of some weeks its proprietor roderick usher had been one of\r\nmy boon companions in boyhood but many years had elapsed since our\r\nlast meeting a letter however had lately reached me in a distant\r\npart of the countrya letter from himwhich in its wildly\r\ninportunate nature had admitted of no other than a personal reply\r\nthe ms gave evidence of nervous agitation the writer spoke of acute\r\nbodily illness of a mental disorder which oppressed him and of an\r\nearnest desire to see me as his best and indeed his only personal\r\nfriend with a view of attempting by the cheerfulness of my society\r\nsome alleviation of his malady it was the manner in which all this\r\nand much more was saidit was the apparent heart that went\r\nwith his requestwhich allowed me no room for hesitation and i\r\naccordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular\r\nsummons\r\n\r\nalthough as boys we had been even intimate associates yet i really\r\nknew little of my friend his reserve had been always excessive and\r\nhabitual i was aware however that his very ancient family had been\r\nnoted time out of mind for a peculiar sensibility of temperament\r\ndisplaying itself through long ages in many works of exalted art\r\nand manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive\r\ncharity as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies\r\nperhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable\r\nbeauties of musical science i had learned too the very remarkable\r\nfact that the stem of the usher race all timehonored as it was had\r\nput forth at no period any enduring branch in other words that the\r\nentire family lay in the direct line of descent and had always with\r\nvery trifling and very temporary variation so lain it was this\r\ndeficiency i considered while running over in thought the perfect\r\nkeeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character\r\nof the people and while speculating upon the possible influence which\r\nthe one in the long lapse of centuries might have exercised upon the\r\notherit was this deficiency perhaps of collateral issue and the\r\nconsequent undeviating transmission from sire to son of the patrimony\r\nwith the name which had at length so identified the two as to merge\r\nthe original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal\r\nappellation of the house of usheran appellation which seemed to\r\ninclude in the minds of the peasantry who used it both the family\r\nand the family mansion\r\n\r\ni have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment\r\nthat of looking down within the tarn had been to deepen the first\r\nsingular impression there can be no doubt that the consciousness of\r\nthe rapid increase of my superstitionfor why should i not so term\r\nitserved mainly to accelerate the increase itself such i have\r\nlong known is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as\r\na basis and it might have been for this reason only that when i\r\nagain uplifted my eyes to the house itself from its image in the\r\npool there grew in my mind a strange fancya fancy so ridiculous\r\nindeed that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the\r\nsensations which oppressed me i had so worked upon my imagination as\r\nreally to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung\r\nan atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity an\r\natmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven but which had\r\nreeked up from the decayed trees and the gray wall and the silent\r\ntarn a pestilent and mystic vapor dull sluggish faintly\r\ndiscernible and leadenhued\r\n\r\nshaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream i\r\nscanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building its principal\r\nfeature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity  the\r\ndiscoloration of ages had been great minute fungi overspread the\r\nwhole exterior hanging in a fine tangled webwork from the eaves yet\r\nall this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation no portion of\r\nthe masonry had fallen and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency\r\nbetween its still perfect adaptation of parts and the crumbling\r\ncondition of the individual stones in this there was much that\r\nreminded one of the specious totality of old woodwork which has\r\nrotted for long years in some neglected vault with no disturbance\r\nfrom the breath of the external air beyond this indication of\r\nextensive decay however the fabric gave little token of\r\ninstability perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have\r\ndiscovered a barely perceptible fissure which extending from the\r\nroof of the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzag\r\ndirection until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn\r\n\r\nnoticing these things i rode over a short causeway to the house a\r\nservant in waiting took my horse and i entered the gothic archway of\r\nthe hall a valet of stealthy step thence conducted me in silence\r\nthrough many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio\r\nof his master much that i encountered on the way contributed i know\r\nnot how to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already\r\nspoken while the objects around mewhile the carvings of the\r\nceilings the sombre tapestries of the walls the ebon blackness of\r\nthe floors and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as\r\ni strode were but matters to which or to such as which i had been\r\naccustomed from my infancywhile i hesitated not to acknowledge how\r\nfamiliar was all thisi still wondered to find how unfamiliar were\r\nthe fancies which ordinary images were stirring up on one of the\r\nstaircases i met the physician of the family his countenance i\r\nthought wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity  he\r\naccosted me with trepidation and passed on  the valet now threw open\r\na door and ushered me into the presence of his master\r\n\r\nthe room in which i found myself was very large and lofty  the\r\nwindows were long narrow and pointed and at so vast a distance from\r\nthe black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from\r\nwithin feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the\r\ntrellised panes and served to render sufficiently distinct the more\r\nprominent objects around the eye however struggled in vain to reach\r\nthe remoter angles of the chamber or the recesses of the vaulted and\r\nfretted ceiling dark draperies hung upon the walls the general\r\nfurniture was profuse comfortless antique and tattered many books\r\nand musical instruments lay scattered about but failed to give any\r\nvitality to the scene i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of\r\nsorrow an air of stern deep and irredeemable gloom hung over and\r\npervaded all\r\n\r\nupon my entrance usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying\r\nat full length and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much\r\nin it i at first thought of an overdone cordialityof the\r\nconstrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world a glance\r\nhowever at his countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity we\r\nsat down and for some moments while he spoke not i gazed upon him\r\nwith a feeling half of pity half of awe surely man had never before\r\nso terribly altered in so brief a period as had roderick usher it\r\nwas with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of\r\nthe wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood yet\r\nthe character of his face had been at all times remarkable a\r\ncadaverousness of complexion an eye large liquid and luminous\r\nbeyond comparison lips somewhat thin and very pallid but of a\r\nsurpassingly beautiful curve a nose of a delicate hebrew model but\r\nwith a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations a finely\r\nmoulded chin speaking in its want of prominence of a want of moral\r\nenergy hair of a more than weblike softness and tenuity these\r\nfeatures with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the\r\ntemple made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten\r\n\r\nand now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these\r\nfeatures and of the expression they were wont to convey lay so much\r\nof change that i doubted to whom i spoke the now ghastly pallor of\r\nthe skin and the now miraculous lustre of the eye above all things\r\nstartled and even awed me the silken hair too had been suffered to\r\ngrow all unheeded and as in its wild gossamer texture it floated\r\nrather than fell about the face i could not even with effort\r\nconnect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity\r\n\r\nin the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherence\r\nan inconsistency and i soon found this to arise from a series of\r\nfeeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy an\r\nexcessive nervous agitation for something of this nature i had indeed\r\nbeen prepared no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain\r\nboyish traits and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical\r\nconformation and temperament his action was alternately vivacious and\r\nsullen his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision when the\r\nanimal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance to that species of\r\nenergetic concisionthat abrupt weighty unhurried and\r\nhollowsounding enunciationthat leaden selfbalanced and perfectly\r\nmodulated guttural utterancewhich may be observed in the lost\r\ndrunkard or the irreclaimable eater of opium during the periods of\r\nhis most intense excitement\r\n\r\nit was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit of his earnest\r\ndesire to see me and of the solace he expected me to afford him he\r\nentered at some length into what he conceived to be the nature of\r\nhis malady it was he said a constitutional and a family evil and\r\none for which he despaired to find a remedya mere nervous affection\r\nhe immediately added which would undoubtedly soon pass off it\r\ndisplayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations some of these as\r\nhe detailed them interested and bewildered me although perhaps the\r\nterms and the general manner of the narration had their weight he\r\nsuffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses the most insipid\r\nfood was alone endurable he could wear only garments of certain\r\ntexture the odors of all flowers were oppressive his eyes were\r\ntortured by even a faint light and there were but peculiar sounds\r\nand these from stringed instruments which did not inspire him with\r\nhorror\r\n\r\nto an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave i\r\nshall perish said he i must perish in this deplorable\r\nfolly thus thus and not otherwise shall i be lost i dread the\r\nevents of the future not in themselves but in their results i\r\nshudder at the thought of any even the most trivial incident which\r\nmay operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul i have indeed\r\nno abhorrence of danger except in its absolute effectin terror in\r\nthis unnervedin this pitiable condition i feel that the period will\r\nsooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together\r\nin some struggle with the grim phantasm fear\r\n\r\ni learned moreover at intervals and through broken and equivocal\r\nhints another singular feature of his mental condition  he was\r\nenchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the\r\ndwelling which he tenanted and whence for many years he had never\r\nventured forthin regard to an influence whose supposititious force\r\nwas conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be restatedan influence\r\nwhich some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family\r\nmansion had by dint of long sufferance he said obtained over his\r\nspiritan effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets\r\nand of the dim tarn into which they all looked down had at length\r\nbrought about upon the morale of his existence\r\n\r\nhe admitted however although with hesitation that much of the\r\npeculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more\r\nnatural and far more palpable originto the severe and longcontinued\r\nillness indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution of a\r\ntenderly beloved sisterhis sole companion for long years his last\r\nand only relative on earth her decease he said with a bitterness\r\nwhich i can never forget would leave him him the hopeless and the\r\nfrail the last of the ancient race of the ushers while he spoke\r\nthe lady madeline for so was she called passed slowly through a\r\nremote portion of the apartment and without having noticed my\r\npresence disappeared i regarded her with an utter astonishment not\r\nunmingled with dread and yet i found it impossible to account for\r\nsuch feelings a sensation of stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed\r\nher retreating steps  when a door at length closed upon her my\r\nglance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the\r\nbrother but he had buried his face in his hands and i could only\r\nperceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the\r\nemaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears\r\n\r\nthe disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of her\r\nphysicians a settled apathy a gradual wasting away of the person\r\nand frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical\r\ncharacter were the unusual diagnosis  hitherto she had steadily\r\nborne up against the pressure of her malady and had not betaken\r\nherself finally to bed but on the closing in of the evening of my\r\narrival at the house she succumbed as her brother told me at night\r\nwith inexpressible agitation to the prostrating power of the\r\ndestroyer and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person\r\nwould thus probably be the last i should obtainthat the lady at\r\nleast while living would be seen by me no more\r\n\r\nfor several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either usher or\r\nmyself and during this period i was busied in earnest endeavors to\r\nalleviate the melancholy of my friend  we painted and read together\r\nor i listened as if in a dream to the wild improvisations of his\r\nspeaking guitar and thus as a closer and still closer intimacy\r\nadmitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit the\r\nmore bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a\r\nmind from which darkness as if an inherent positive quality poured\r\nforth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one\r\nunceasing radiation of gloom\r\n\r\ni shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus\r\nspent alone with the master of the house of usher yet i should fail\r\nin any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the\r\nstudies or of the occupations in which he involved me or led me the\r\nway an excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous\r\nlustre over all  his long improvised dirges will ring forever in my\r\nears  among other things i hold painfully in mind a certain singular\r\nperversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von\r\nweber from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded and\r\nwhich grew touch by touch into vaguenesses at which i shuddered the\r\nmore thrillingly because i shuddered knowing not whyfrom these\r\npaintings vivid as their images now are before me i would in vain\r\nendeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within\r\nthe compass of merely written words by the utter simplicity by the\r\nnakedness of his designs he arrested and overawed attention  if ever\r\nmortal painted an idea that mortal was roderick usher for me at\r\nleast in the circumstances then surrounding me there arose out of\r\nthe pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon\r\nhis canvas an intensity of intolerable awe no shadow of which felt i\r\never yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too\r\nconcrete reveries of fuseli\r\n\r\none of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend partaking not so\r\nrigidly of the spirit of abstraction may be shadowed forth although\r\nfeebly in words  a small picture presented the interior of an\r\nimmensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel with low walls\r\nsmooth white and without interruption or device certain accessory\r\npoints of the design served well to convey the idea that this\r\nexcavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the\r\nearth no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent and\r\nno torch or other artificial source of light was discernible yet a\r\nflood of intense rays rolled throughout and bathed the whole in a\r\nghastly and inappropriate splendor\r\n\r\ni have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve\r\nwhich rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer with the\r\nexception of certain effects of stringed instruments it was perhaps\r\nthe narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar\r\nwhich gave birth in great measure to the fantastic character of his\r\nperformances but the fervid facility of his impromptus could\r\nnot be so accounted for they must have been and were in the notes\r\nas well as in the words of his wild fantasias for he not unfrequently\r\naccompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations the result of\r\nthat intense mental collectedness and concentration to which i have\r\npreviously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the\r\nhighest artificial excitement the words of one of these rhapsodies i\r\nhave easily remembered i was perhaps the more forcibly impressed\r\nwith it as he gave it because in the under or mystic current of its\r\nmeaning i fancied that i perceived and for the first time a full\r\nconsciousness on the part of usher of the tottering of his lofty\r\nreason upon her throne  the verses which were entitled the haunted\r\npalace ran very nearly if not accurately thus\r\n\r\n\r\ni\r\n\r\nin the greenest of our valleys\r\n  by

which i mention not so much on account of its novelty for\r\nother men haye thought thus as on account of the pertinacity with\r\nwhich he maintained it this opinion in its general form was that of\r\nthe sentience of all vegetable things but in his disordered fancy the\r\nidea had assumed a more daring character and trespassed under\r\ncertain conditions upon the kingdom of inorganization i lack words\r\nto express the full extent or the earnest abandon of his\r\npersuasion the belief however was connected as i have previously\r\nhinted with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers the\r\nconditions of the sentience had been here he imagined fulfilled in\r\nthe method of collocation of these stonesin the order of their\r\narrangement as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread\r\nthem and of the decayed trees which stood aroundabove all in the\r\nlong undisturbed endurance of this arrangement and in its\r\nreduplication in the still waters of the tarn its evidencethe\r\nevidence of the sentiencewas to be seen he said and i here started\r\nas he spoke in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere\r\nof their own about the waters and the walls the result was\r\ndiscoverable he added in that silent yet importunate and terrible\r\ninfluence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family\r\nand which made him what i now saw

his chief delight\r\nhowever was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious\r\nbook in quarto gothicthe manual of a forgotten churchthe\r\nvigilice mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiæ maguntinæ\r\n\r\ni could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work and of its\r\nprobable influence upon the hypochondriac when one evening having\r\ninformed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more he stated his\r\nintention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight previously to its\r\nfinal interment in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls\r\nof the building  the worldly reason however assigned for this\r\nsingular proceeding was one which i did not feel at liberty to\r\ndispute  the brother had been led to his resolution so he told me\r\nby consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the\r\ndeceased of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her\r\nmedical men and of the remote and exposed situation of the\r\nburialground of the family i will not deny that when i called to\r\nmind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the\r\nstaircase on the day of my arrival at the house i had no desire to\r\noppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless and by no means an\r\nunnatural precaution\r\n\r\nat the request of usher i personally aided him in the arrangements\r\nfor the temporary entombment the body having been encoffined we two\r\nalone bore it to its rest the vault in which we placed it and which\r\nhad been so long unopened that our torches half smothered in its\r\noppressive atmosphere gave us little opportunity for investigation\r\nwas small damp and entirely without means of admission for light\r\nlying at great depth immediately beneath that portion of the\r\nbuilding in which was my own sleeping apartment it had been used\r\napparently in remote feudal times for the worst purposes of a\r\ndonjonkeep and in later days as a place of deposit for powder or\r\nsome other highly combustible substance as a portion of its floor\r\nand the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it\r\nwere carefully sheathed with copper the door of massive iron had\r\nbeen also similarly protected its immense weight caused an\r\nunusually sharp grating sound as it moved upon its hinges\r\n\r\nhaving deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region\r\nof horror we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the\r\ncoffin and looked upon the face of the tenant a striking similitude\r\nbetween the brother and sister now first arrested my attention and\r\nusher divining perhaps my thoughts murmured out some few words\r\nfrom which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins and\r\nthat sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed\r\nbetween them our glances however rested not long upon the deadfor\r\nwe could not regard her unawed the disease which had thus entombed\r\nthe lady in the maturity of youth had left as usual in all maladies\r\nof a strictly cataleptical character the mockery of a faint blush\r\nupon the bosom and the face and that suspiciously lingering smile\r\nupon the lip which is so terrible in death we replaced and screwed\r\ndown the lid and having secured the door of iron made our way with\r\ntoil into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of\r\nthe house\r\n\r\nand now some days of bitter grief having elapsed an observable\r\nchange came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend his\r\nordinary manner had vanished his ordinary occupations were neglected\r\nor forgotten he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried unequal\r\nand objectless step the pallor of his countenance had assumed if\r\npossible a more ghastly huebut the luminousness of his eye had\r\nutterly gone out the once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard\r\nno more and a tremulous quaver as if of extreme terror habitually\r\ncharacterized his utterance there were times indeed when i thought\r\nhis unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive\r\nsecret to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage at\r\ntimes again i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable\r\nvagaries of madness for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long\r\nhours in an attitude of the profoundest attention as if listening to\r\nsome imaginary sound it was no wonder that his condition\r\nterrifiedthat it infected me i felt creeping upon me by slow yet\r\ncertain degrees the wild influences of his own fantastic yet\r\nimpressive superstitions\r\n\r\nit was especially upon retiring to bed late in the night of the\r\nseventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline within\r\nthe donjon that i experienced the full power of such feelings sleep\r\ncame not near my couch while the hours waned and waned away i\r\nstruggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me i\r\nendeavored to believe that much if not all of what i felt was due to\r\nthe bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the roomof the\r\ndark and tattered draperies which tortured into motion by the breath\r\nof a rising tempest swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls and\r\nrustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed but my efforts were\r\nfruitless an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame and at\r\nlength there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless\r\nalarm shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle i uplifted myself\r\nupon the pillows and peering earnestly within the intense darkness\r\nof the chamber hearkenedi know not why except that an instinctive\r\nspirit prompted meto certain low and indefinite sounds which came\r\nthrough the pauses of the storm at long intervals i knew not\r\nwhence overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror unaccountable\r\nyet unendurable i threw on my clothes with haste for i felt that i\r\nshould sleep no more during the night and endeavored to arouse\r\nmyself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen by pacing\r\nrapidly to and fro through the apartment\r\n\r\ni had taken but few turns in this manner when a light step on an\r\nadjoining staircase arrested my attention i presently recognized it\r\nas that of usher in an instant afterward he rapped with a gentle\r\ntouch at my door and entered bearing a lamp his countenance was as\r\nusual cadaverously wanbut moreover there was a species of mad\r\nhilarity in his eyesan evidently restrained hysteria in his whole\r\ndemeanor his air appalled mebut anything was preferable to the\r\nsolitude which i had so long endured and i even welcomed his presence\r\nas a relief\r\n\r\nand you have not seen it he said abruptly after having stared\r\nabout him for some moments in silenceyou have not then seen\r\nitbut stay you shall thus speaking and having carefully shaded\r\nhis lamp he hurried to one of the casements and threw it freely open\r\nto the storm\r\n\r\nthe impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our\r\nfeet it was indeed a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night and\r\none wildly singular in its terror and its beauty a whirlwind had\r\napparently collected its force in our vicinity for there were\r\nfrequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind and the\r\nexceeding density of the clouds which hung so low as to press upon\r\nthe turrets of the house did not prevent our perceiving the lifelike\r\nvelocity with which they flew careering from all points against each\r\nother without passing away into the distance i say that even their\r\nexceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this yet we had no\r\nglimpse of the moon or stars nor was there any flashing forth of the\r\nlightning but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated\r\nvapor as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us were\r\nglowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly\r\nvisible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the\r\nmansion\r\n\r\nyou must notyou shall not behold this said i shudderingly to\r\nusher as i led him with a gentle violence from the window to a\r\nseat these appearances which bewilder you are merely electrical\r\nphenomena not uncommonor it may be that they have their ghastly\r\norigin in the rank miasma of the tarn let us close this casement the\r\nair is chilling and dangerous to your frame here is one of your\r\nfavorite romances i will read and you shall listenand so we will\r\npass away this terrible night together\r\n\r\nthe antique volume which i had taken up was the mad trist of sir\r\nlauncelot canning but i had called it a favorite of ushers more in\r\nsad jest than in earnest for in truth there is little in its\r\nuncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for\r\nthe lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend it was however the\r\nonly book immediately at hand and i indulged a vague hope that the\r\nexcitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief for\r\nthe history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies even in\r\nthe extremeness of the folly which i should read could i have judged\r\nindeed by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he\r\nhearkened or apparently hearkened to the words of the tale i might\r\nwell have congratulated myself upon the success of my design\r\n\r\ni had arrived at that wellknown portion of the story where ethelred\r\nthe hero of the trist having sought in vain for peaceable admission\r\ninto the dwelling of the hermit proceeds to make good an entrance by\r\nforce here it will be remembered the words of the narrative run\r\nthus\r\n\r\nand ethelred who was by nature of a doughty heart and who was now\r\nmighty withal on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had\r\ndrunken waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit who in\r\nsooth was of an obstinate and maliceful turn but feeling the rain\r\nupon his shoulders and fearing the rising of the tempest uplifted\r\nhis mace outright and with blows made quickly room in the plankings\r\nof the door for his gauntleted hand and now pulling therewith\r\nsturdily he so cracked and ripped and tore all asunder that the\r\nnoise of the dry and hollowsounding wood alarumed and reverberated\r\nthroughout the forest\r\n\r\nat the termination of this sentence i started and for a moment\r\npaused for it appeared to me although i at once concluded that my\r\nexcited fancy had deceived meit appeared to me that from some very\r\nremote portion of the mansion there came indistinctly to my ears\r\nwhat might have been in its exact similarity of character the echo\r\nbut a stifled and dull one certainly of the very cracking and\r\nripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described it\r\nwas beyond doubt the coincidence alone which had arrested my\r\nattention for amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements and\r\nthe ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm the\r\nsound in itself had nothing surely which should have interested or\r\ndisturbed me i continued the story\r\n\r\nbut the good champion ethelred now entering within the door was\r\nsore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit\r\nbut in the stead thereof a dragon of a scaly and prodigious\r\ndemeanor and of a fiery tongue which sate in guard before a palace\r\nof gold with a floor of silver and upon the wall there hung a shield\r\nof shining brass with this legend enwritten\r\n\r\n  who entereth herein a conqueror hath bin\r\n  who slayeth the dragon the shield he shall win\r\n\r\nand ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head of the\r\ndragon which fell before him and gave up his pesty breath with a\r\nshriek so horrid and harsh and withal so piercing that ethelred had\r\nfain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of\r\nit the like whereof was never before heard\r\n\r\nhere again i paused abruptly and now with a feeling of wild\r\namazement for there could be no doubt whatever that in this\r\ninstance i did actually hear although from what direction it\r\nproceeded i found it impossible to say a low and apparently distant\r\nbut harsh protracted and most unusual screaming or grating\r\nsoundthe exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up\r\nfor the dragons unnatural shriek as described by the romancer\r\n\r\noppressed as i certainly was upon the occurrence of this second and\r\nmost extraordinary coincidence by a thousand conflicting sensations\r\nin which wonder and extreme terror were predominant i still retained\r\nsufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting by any observation the\r\nsensitive nervousness of my companion i was by no means certain that\r\nhe had noticed the sounds in question although assuredly a strange\r\nalteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his\r\ndemeanor from a position fronting my own he had gradually brought\r\nround his chair so as to sit with his face to the door of the\r\nchamber and thus i could but partially perceive his features\r\nalthough i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring\r\ninaudibly his head had dropped upon his breastyet i knew that he\r\nwas not asleep from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught\r\na glance of it in profile the motion of his body too was at\r\nvariance with this ideafor he rocked from side to side with a gentle\r\nyet constant and uniform sway having rapidly taken notice of all\r\nthis i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot which thus\r\nproceeded\r\n\r\nand now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury of the\r\ndragon bethinking himself of the brazen shield and of the breaking\r\nup of the enchantment which was upon it removed the carcass from out\r\nof the way before him and approached valorously over the silver\r\npavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall which in\r\nsooth tarried not for his full coming but fell down at his feet upon\r\nthe silver floor with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound\r\n\r\nno sooner had these syllables passed my lips thanas if a shield of\r\nbrass had indeed at the moment fallen heavily upon a floor of\r\nsilveri became aware of a distinct hollow metallic and clangorous\r\nyet apparently muffled reverberation  completely unnerved i leaped\r\nto my feet but the measured rocking movement of usher was\r\nundisturbed i rushed to the chair in which he sat his eyes were bent\r\nfixedly before him and throughout his whole countenance there reigned\r\na stony rigidity but as i placed my hand upon his shoulder there\r\ncame a strong shudder over his whole person a sickly smile quivered\r\nabout his lips and i saw that he spoke in a low hurried and\r\ngibbering murmur as if unconscious of my presence  bending closely\r\nover him i at length drank in the hideous import of his words\r\n\r\nnot hear ityes i hear it and have heard it\r\nlonglonglongmany minutes many hours many days have i heard\r\nityet i dared notoh pity me miserable

furiously to\r\nhis feet and shrieked out his syllables as if in the effort he were\r\ngiving up his soulmadman i tell you that she now stands without\r\nthe door\r\n\r\nas if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found\r\nthe potency of a spell the huge antique panels to hich the speaker\r\npointed threw slowly back upon the instant their ponderous and ebony\r\njaws it was the work of the rushing gustbut then without those\r\ndoors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the\r\nlady madeline of usher  there was blood upon her white robes and the\r\nevidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated\r\nframe for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon\r\nthe thresholdthen with a low moaning cry fell heavily inward upon\r\nthe person of her brother and in her violent and now final\r\ndeathagonies bore him to the floor a corpse and a victim to the\r\nterrors he had anticipated\r\n\r\nfrom that chamber and from that mansion i fled aghast  the storm\r\nwas still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old\r\ncauseway suddenly there shot along the path a wild light and i\r\nturned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued for the\r\nvast house and its shadows were alone behind me the radiance was that\r\nof the full setting and bloodred moon which now shone vividly\r\nthrough that once barelydiscernible fissure of which i have before\r\nspoken as extending from the roof of the building in a zigzag\r\ndirection to the base while i gazed this fissure rapidly\r\nwidenedthere came a fierce breath of the whirlwindthe entire orb\r\nof the satellite burst at once upon my sightmy brain reeled as i saw\r\nthe mighty walls rushing asunderthere was a long tumultuous shouting\r\nsound

unspeakable misery and unpardonable crime  this epoch these\r\nlater years took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude\r\nwhose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign men usually\r\ngrow base by degrees from me in an instant all virtue dropped\r\nbodily as a mantle from comparatively trivial wickedness i passed\r\nwith the stride of a giant into more than the enormities of an\r\nelahgabalus  what chancewhat one event brought this evil thing to\r\npass bear with me while i relate death approaches and the shadow\r\nwhich foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit i\r\nlong in passing through the dim valley for the sympathyi had\r\nnearly said for the pityof my fellowmen i would fain have them\r\nbelieve that i have been in some measure the slave of circumstances\r\nbeyond human control  i would wish them to seek out for me in the\r\ndetails i am about to give some little oasis of fatality amid a\r\nwilderness of error i would have them allowwhat they cannot refrain\r\nfrom allowingthat although temptation may have erewhile existed as\r\ngreat man was never thus at least tempted beforecertainly\r\nnever thus fell and is it therefore that he has never thus\r\nsuffered have i not indeed been living in a dream and am i not now\r\ndying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all\r\nsublunary visions\r\n\r\ni am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable\r\ntemperament has at all times rendered them remarkable and in my\r\nearliest infancy i gave evidence of having fully inherited the family\r\ncharacter as i advanced in years it was more strongly developed\r\nbecoming for many reasons a cause of serious disquietude to my\r\nfriends and of positive injury to myself i grew selfwilled\r\naddicted to the wildest caprices and a prey to the most ungovernable\r\npassions  weakminded and beset with constitutional infirmities akin\r\nto my own my parents could do but little to check the evil\r\npropensities which distinguished me some feeble and illdirected\r\nefforts resulted in complete failure on their part and of course in\r\ntotal triumph on mine thenceforward my voice was a household law and\r\nat an age when few children have abandoned their leadingstrings i was\r\nleft to the guidance of my own will and became in all but name the\r\nmaster of my own actions\r\n\r\nmy earliest recollections of a schoollife are connected with a large\r\nrambling elizabethan house in a mistylooking village of england\r\nwhere were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees and where all\r\nthe houses were excessively ancient in truth it was a dreamlike and\r\nspiritsoothing place that venerable old town at this moment in\r\nfancy i feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeplyshadowed\r\navenues inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies and thrill\r\nanew with undefinable delight at the deep hollow note of the\r\nchurchbell breaking each hour with sullen and sudden roar upon\r\nthe stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted gothic\r\nsteeple lay imbedded and asleep\r\n\r\nit gives me perhaps as much of pleasure as i can now in any manner\r\nexperience to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its\r\nconcerns steeped in misery as i ammisery alas only too reali\r\nshall be pardoned for seeking relief however slight and temporary in\r\nthe weakness of a few rambling details these moreover utterly\r\ntrivial and even ridiculous in themselves assume to my fancy\r\nadventitious importance as connected with a period and a locality\r\nwhen and where i recognize the first ambiguous monitions of the\r\ndestiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me let me then\r\nremember\r\n\r\nthe house i have said was old and irregular the grounds were\r\nextensive and a high and solid brick wall topped with a bed of\r\nmortar and broken glass encompassed the whole  this prisonlike\r\nrampart formed the limit of our domain beyond it we saw but thrice a\r\nweekonce every saturday afternoon when attended by two ushers we\r\nwere permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the\r\nneighboring fieldsand twice during sunday when we were paraded in\r\nthe same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one\r\nchurch of the village of this church the principal of our school was\r\npastor with how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was i wont to\r\nregard him from our remote pew in the gallery as with step solemn\r\nand slow he ascended the pulpit this reverend man with countenance\r\nso demurely benign with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing\r\nwith wig so minutely powdered so rigid and so vastcould this be he\r\nwho of late with sour visage and in snuffy habiliments\r\nadministered ferule in hand the draconian laws of the academy oh\r\ngigantic paradox too utterly monstrous for solution\r\n\r\nat an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate it\r\nwas riveted and studded with iron bolts and surmounted with jagged\r\niron spikes what impressions of deep awe did it inspire it was never\r\nopened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions\r\nalready mentioned then in every creak of its mighty hinges we found\r\na plenitude of mysterya world of matter for solemn remark or for\r\nmore solemn meditation\r\n\r\nthe extensive enclosure was irregular in form having many capacious\r\nrecesses of these three or four of the largest constituted the\r\nplayground it was level and covered with fine hard gravel i well\r\nremember it had no trees nor benches nor anything similar within\r\nit of course it was in the rear of the house in front lay a small\r\nparterre planted with box and other shrubs but through this sacred\r\ndivision we passed only upon rare occasions indeedsuch as a first\r\nadvent to school or final departure thence or perhaps when a parent\r\nor friend having called for us we joyfully took our way home for the\r\nchristmas or midsummer holidays\r\n\r\nbut the househow quaint an old building was thisto me how\r\nveritably a palace of enchantment there was really no end to its\r\nwindingsto its incomprehensible subdivisions it was difficult at\r\nany given time to say with certainty upon which of its two stories\r\none happened to be from each room to every other there were sure to\r\nbe found three or four steps either in ascent or descent then the\r\nlateral branches were innumerable inconceivable and so returning in\r\nupon themselves that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole\r\nmansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered\r\nupon infinity during the five years of my residence here i was never\r\nable to ascertain with precision in what remote locality lay the\r\nlittle sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or\r\ntwenty other scholars\r\n\r\nthe schoolroom was the largest in the housei could not help\r\nthinking in the world it was very long narrow and dismally low\r\nwith pointed gothic windows and a ceiling of oak in a remote and\r\nterrorinspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet\r\ncomprising the sanctum during hours of our principal the\r\nreverend dr bransby it was a solid structure with massy door\r\nsooner than open which in the absence of the dominie we would all\r\nhave willingly perished by the peine forte et dure in other angles\r\nwere two other similar boxes far less reverenced indeed but still\r\ngreatly matters of awe one of these was the pulpit of the classical\r\nusher one of the english and mathematical  interspersed about the\r\nroom crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity were\r\ninnumerable benches and desks black ancient and timeworn piled\r\ndesperately with muchbethumbed books and so beseamed with initial\r\nletters names at full length grotesque figures and other multiplied\r\nefforts of the knife as to have entirely lost what little of original\r\nform might have been their portion in days long departed a huge\r\nbucket with water stood at one extremity of the room and a clock of\r\nstupendous dimensions at the other\r\n\r\nencompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy i passed\r\nyet not in tedium or disgust the years of the third lustrum of my\r\nlife the teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of\r\nincident to occupy or amuse it and the apparently dismal monotony of\r\na school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth\r\nhas derived from luxury or my full manhood from crime yet i must\r\nbelieve that my first mental development had in it much of the\r\nuncommoneven much of the outré upon mankind at large the events\r\nof very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite\r\nimpression all is gray shadowa weak and irregular remembrancean\r\nindistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric\r\npains with me this is not so in childhood i must have felt with the\r\nenergy of a man what i now find stamped upon memory in lines as\r\nvivid as deep and as durable as the exergues of the carthaginian\r\nmedals\r\n\r\nyet in factin the fact of the worlds viewhow little was there to\r\nremember the mornings awakening the nightly summons to bed the\r\nconnings the recitations the periodical halfholidays and\r\nperambulations the playground with its broils its pastimes its\r\nintriguesthese by a mental sorcery long forgotten were made to\r\ninvolve a wilderness of sensation a world of rich incident an\r\nuniverse of varied emotion of excitement the most passionate and\r\nspiritstirring  oh le bon temps que ce siècle de fer\r\n\r\nin truth the ardor the enthusiasm and the imperiousness of my\r\ndisposition soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates\r\nand by slow but natural gradations gave me an ascendancy over all not\r\ngreatly older than myself over all with a single exception this\r\nexception was found in the person of a scholar who although no\r\nrelation bore the same christian and surname as myselfa\r\ncircumstance in fact little remarkable for notwithstanding a noble\r\ndescent mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem by\r\nprescriptive right to have been time out of mind the common property\r\nof the mob in this narrative i have therefore designated myself as\r\nwilliam wilsona fictitious title not very dissimilar to the\r\nreal my namesake alone of those who in schoolphraseology\r\nconstituted our set presumed to compete with me in the studies of\r\nthe classin the sports and broils of the playgroundto refuse\r\nimplicit belief in my assertions and submission to my willindeed\r\nto interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever\r\nif there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism it is the\r\ndespotism of a mastermind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits\r\nof its companions\r\n\r\nwilsons rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment\r\nthe more so as in spite of the bravado with which in public i made a\r\npoint of treating him and his pretensions i secretly felt that i\r\nfeared him and could not help thinking the equality which he\r\nmaintained so easily with myself a proof of his true superiority\r\nsince not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle yet this\r\nsuperiority even this equality was in truth acknowledged by no one\r\nbut myself our associates by some unaccountable blindness seemed\r\nnot even to suspect it indeed his competition his resistance and\r\nespecially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes\r\nwere not more pointed than private he appeared to be destitute alike\r\nof the ambition which urged and of the passionate energy of mind\r\nwhich enabled me to excel in his rivalry he might have been supposed\r\nactuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart astonish or mortify\r\nmyself although there were times when i could not help observing\r\nwith a feeling made up of wonder abasement and pique that he\r\nmingled with his injuries his insults or his contradictions a\r\ncertain most inappropriate and assuredly most unwelcome\r\naffectionateness of manner i could only conceive this singular\r\nbehavior to arise from a consummate selfconceit assuming the vulgar\r\nairs of patronage and protection\r\n\r\nperhaps it was this latter trait in wilsons conduct conjoined with\r\nour identity of name and the mere accident of our having entered the\r\nschool upon the same day which set afloat the notion that we were\r\nbrothers among the senior classes in the academy these do not\r\nusually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their\r\njuniors i have before said or should have said that wilson was not\r\nin the most remote degree connected with my family but assuredly if\r\nwe had been brothers we must have been twins for after leaving\r\ndr bransbys i cassually learned that my namesake was born on the\r\nnineteenth of january  and this is a somewhat remarkable\r\ncoincidence for the day is precisely that of my own nativity\r\n\r\nit may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned\r\nme by the rivalry of wilson and his intolerable spirit of\r\ncontradiction i could not bring myself to hate him altogether we\r\nhad to be sure nearly every day a quarrel in which yielding me\r\npublicly the palm of victory he in some manner contrieved to make\r\nme feel that it was he who had deserved it yet a sense of pride on my\r\npart and a veritable dignity on his own kept us always upon what are\r\ncalled speaking terms while there were many points of strong\r\ncongeniality in our tempers operating to awake in me a sentiment\r\nwhich our position alone perhaps prevented from ripening into\r\nfriendship it is difficult indeed to define or even to describe\r\nmy real feelings towards him they formed a motley and heterogeneous\r\nadmixture some petulant animosity which was not yet hatred some\r\nesteem more respect much fear with a world of uneasy curiosity to\r\nthe moralist it will be unnecessary to say in addition that wilson\r\nand myself were the most inseparable of companions\r\n\r\nit was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us\r\nwhich turned all my attacks upon him and they were many either open\r\nor covert into the channel of banter or practical joke giving pain\r\nwhile assuming the aspect of mere fun rather than into a more serious\r\nand determined hostility but my endeavors on this head were by no\r\nmeans uniformly successful even when my plans were the most wittily\r\nconcocted for my namesake had much about him in character of that\r\nunassuming and quiet austerity which while enjoying the poignancy of\r\nits own jokes has no heel of achilles in itself and absolutely\r\nrefuses to be laughed at i could find indeed but one vulnerable\r\npoint and that lying in a personal peculiarity arising perhaps from\r\nconstitutional disease would have been spared by any antagonist less\r\nat his wits end than myselfmy rival had a weakness in the faucial\r\nor guttural organs which precluded him from raising his voice at any\r\ntime above a very low whisper of this defect i did not fail to take\r\nwhat poor advantage lay in my power\r\n\r\nwilsons retaliations in kind were many and there was one form of his\r\npractical wit that disturbed me beyond measure  how his sagacity\r\nfirst discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me is a\r\nquestion i never could solve but having discovered he habitually\r\npractised the annoyance i had always felt aversion to my uncourtly\r\npatronymic and its very common if not plebeian praenomen the words\r\nwere venom in my ears and when upon the day of my arrival a second\r\nwilliam wilson came also to the academy i felt angry with him for\r\nbearing the name and doubly disgusted with the name because a\r\nstranger bore it who would be the cause of its twofold repetition\r\nwho would be constantly in my presence and whose concerns in the\r\nordinary routine of the school business must inevitably on account\r\nof the detestable coincidence be often confounded with my own\r\n\r\nthe feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every\r\ncircumstance tending to show resemblance moral or physical between\r\nmy rival and myself i had not then discovered the remarkable fact\r\nthat we were of the same age but i saw that we were of the same\r\nheight and i perceived that we were even singularly alike in general\r\ncontour of person and outline of feature i was galled too by the\r\nrumor touching a relationship which had grown current in the upper\r\nforms  in a word nothing could more seriously disturb me although i\r\nscrupulously concealed such disturbance than any allusion to a\r\nsimilarity of mind person or condition existing between us but in\r\ntruth i had no reason to believe that with the exception of the\r\nmatter of relationship and in the case of wilson himself this\r\nsimilarity had ever been made a subject of comment or even observed\r\nat all by our schoolfellows that he observed it in all its\r\nbearings and as fixedly as i was apparent but that he could\r\ndiscover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance can\r\nonly be attributed as i said before to his more than ordinary\r\npenetration\r\n\r\nhis cue which was to perfect an imitation of myself lay both in\r\nwords and in actions and most admirably did he play his part my\r\ndress it was an easy matter to copy my gait and general manner were\r\nwithout difficulty appropriated in spite of his constitutional\r\ndefect even my voice did not escape him  my louder tones were of\r\ncourse unattempted but then the keyit was identical and his\r\nsingular whisperit grew the very echo of my own\r\n\r\nhow greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me for it could\r\nnot justly be termed a caricature i will not now venture to describe\r\ni had but one consolationin the fact that the imitation apparently\r\nwas noticed by myself alone and that i had to endure only the knowing\r\nand strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself satisfied with\r\nhaving produced in my bosom the intended effect he seemed to chuckle\r\nin secret over the sting he had inflicted and was\r\nuncharacteristically disregardful of the public applause which the\r\nsuccess of his witty endeavours might have so easily elicited  that\r\nthe school indeed did not feel his design perceive its\r\naccomplishment and participate in his sneer was for many anxious\r\nmonths a riddle i could not resolve perhaps the gradation of his\r\ncopy rendered it not so readily perceptible or more possibly i owed\r\nmy security to the masterly air of the copyist who disdaining the\r\nletter which in a painting is all the obtuse can see gave but the\r\nfull spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and\r\nchagrin\r\n\r\ni have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of\r\npatronage which he assumed toward me and of his frequent officious\r\ninterference with my will this interference often took the ungracious\r\ncharacter of advice advice not openly given but hinted or\r\ninsinuated i received it with a repugnance which gained strength as i\r\ngrew in years yet at this distant day let me do him the simple\r\njustice to acknowledge that i can recall no occasion when the\r\nsuggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so\r\nusual to his immature age and seeming inexperience that his moral\r\nsense at least if not his general talents and worldly wisdom was\r\nfar keener than my own and that i might today have been a better\r\nand thus a happier man had i less frequently rejected the counsels\r\nembodied in those meaning whispers which i then but too cordially\r\nhated and too bitterly despised\r\n\r\nas it was i at length grew restive in the extreme under his\r\ndistasteful supervision and daily resented more and more openly what\r\ni considered his intolerable arrogance i have said that in the first\r\nyears of our connection as schoolmates my feelings in regard to him\r\nmight have been easily ripened into friendship but in the latter\r\nmonths of my residence at the academy although the intrusion of his\r\nordinary manner had beyond doubt in some measure abated my\r\nsentiments in nearly similar proportion partook very much of\r\npositive hatred upon one occasion he saw this i think and\r\nafterwards avoided or made a show of avoiding me\r\n\r\nit was about the same period if i remember aright that in an\r\naltercation of violence with him in which he was more than usually\r\nthrown off his guard and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor\r\nrather foreign to his nature i discovered or fancied i discovered\r\nin his accent his air and general appearance a something which first\r\nstartled and then deeply interested me by bringing to mind dim\r\nvisions of my earliest infancywild confused and thronging memories\r\nof a time when memory herself was yet unborn i cannot better describe\r\nthe sensation which oppressed me than by saying that i could with\r\ndifficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the\r\nbeing who stood before me at some epoch very long agosome point of\r\nthe past even infinitely remote the delusion however faded rapidly\r\nas it came and i mention it at all but to define the day of the last\r\nconversation i there held with my singular namesake\r\n\r\nthe huge old house with its countless subdivisions had several large\r\nchambers communicating with each other where slept the greater number\r\nof the students there were however as must necessarily happen in a\r\nbuilding so awkwardly planned many little nooks or recesses the odds\r\nand ends of the structure and these the economic ingenuity of dr\r\nbransby had also fitted up as dormitories although being the merest\r\nclosets they were capable of accommodating but a single\r\nindividual one of these small apartments was occupied by wilson\r\n\r\none night about the close of my fifth year at the school and\r\nimmediately after the altercation just mentioned finding every one\r\nwrapped in sleep i arose from bed and lamp in hand stole through a\r\nwilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my\r\nrival i had long been plotting one of those illnatured pieces of\r\npractical wit at his expense in which i had hitherto been so uniformly\r\nunsuccessful it was my intention now to put my scheme in operation\r\nand i resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with\r\nwhich i was imbued having reached his closet i noiselessly entered\r\nleaving the lamp with a shade over it on the outside i advanced a\r\nstep and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing assured of\r\nhis being asleep i returned took the light and with it again\r\napproached the bed close curtains were around it which in the\r\nprosecution of my plan i slowly and quietly withdrew when the bright\r\nrays fell vividly upon the sleeper and my eyes at the same moment\r\nupon his countenance i lookedand a numbness an iciness of\r\nfeeling instantly pervaded my frame my breast heaved my knees\r\ntottered my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet\r\nintolerable horror gasping for breath i lowered the lamp in still\r\nnearer proximity to the face were thesethese the lineaments of\r\nwilliam wilson i saw indeed that they were his but i shook as if\r\nwith a fit of the ague in fancying they were not what was there\r\nabout them to confound me in this manner i gazedwhile my brain\r\nreeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts not thus he\r\nappearedassuredly not thusin the vivacity of his waking\r\nhours the same name the same contour of person the same day of\r\narrival at the academy and then his dogged and meaningless imitation\r\nof my gait my voice my habits and my manner was it in truth\r\nwithin the bounds of human possibility that what i now saw was the\r\nresult merely of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation\r\nawestricken and with a creeping shudder i extinguished the lamp\r\npassed silently from the chamber and left at once the halls of that\r\nold academy never to enter them again\r\n\r\nafter a lapse of some months spent at home in mere idleness i found\r\nmyself a student at eton the brief interval had been sufficient to\r\nenfeeble my remembrance of the events at dr bransbys or at least to\r\neffect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which i\r\nremembered them the truththe tragedyof the drama was no more i\r\ncould now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses and seldom\r\ncalled up the subject at all but with wonder at the extent of human\r\ncredulity and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which i\r\nhereditarily possessed neither was this species of scepticism likely\r\nto be diminished by the character of the life i led at eton the\r\nvortex of thoughtless folly into which i there so immediately and so\r\nrecklessly plunged washed away all but the froth of my past hours\r\nengulfed at once every solid or serious impression and left to memory\r\nonly the veriest levities of a former existence\r\n\r\ni do not wish however to trace the course of my miserable profligacy\r\nherea profligacy which set at defiance the laws while it eluded the\r\nvigilance of the institution three years of folly passed without\r\nprofit had but given me rooted habits of vice and added in a\r\nsomewhat unusual degree to my bodily stature when after a week of\r\nsoulless dissipation i invited a small party of the most dissolute\r\nstudents to a secret carousal in my chambers we met at a late hour of\r\nthe night for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until\r\nmorning the wine flowed freely and there were not wanting other and\r\nperhaps more dangerous seductions so that the gray dawn had already\r\nfaintly appeared in the east while our delirious extravagance was at\r\nits height  madly flushed with cards and intoxication i was in the\r\nact of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity when my\r\nattention was suddenly diverted by the violent although partial\r\nunclosing of the door of the apartment and by the eager voice of a\r\nservant from without he said that some person apparently in great\r\nhaste demanded to speak with me in the hall\r\n\r\nwildly excited with wine the unexpected interruption rather delighted\r\nthan surprised me i staggered forward at once and a few steps\r\nbrought me to the vestibule of the building in this low and small\r\nroom there hung no lamp and now no light at all was admitted save\r\nthat of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the\r\nsemicircular window as i put my foot over the threshold i became\r\naware of the figure of a youth about my own height and habited in a\r\nwhite kerseymere morning frock cut in the novel fashion of the one i\r\nmyself wore at the moment this the faint light enabled me to\r\nperceive but the features of his face i could not distinguish upon\r\nmy entering he strode hurriedly up to me and seizing me by the arm\r\nwith a gesture of petulant impatience whispered the words william\r\nwilson in my ear\r\n\r\ni grew perfectly sober in an instant\r\n\r\nthere was that in the manner of the stranger and in the tremulous\r\nshake of his uplifted finger as he held it between my eyes and the\r\nlight which filled me with unqualified amazement but it was not this\r\nwhich had so violently moved me it was the pregnancy of solemn\r\nadmonition in the singular low hissing utterance and above all it\r\nwas the character the tone the key of those few simple and\r\nfamiliar yet whispered syllables which came with a thousand\r\nthronging memories of bygone days and struck upon my soul with the\r\nshock of a galvanic battery ere i could recover the use of my senses\r\nhe was gone\r\n\r\nalthough this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered\r\nimagination yet was it evanescent as vivid for some weeks indeed i\r\nbusied myself in earnest inquiry or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid\r\nspeculation i did not pretend to disguise from my perception the\r\nidentity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered\r\nwith my affairs and harassed me with his insinuated counsel but who\r\nand what was this wilsonand whence came heand what were his\r\npurposes upon neither of these points could i be satisfiedmerely\r\nascertaining in regard to him that a sudden accident in his family\r\nhad caused his removal from dr bransbys academy on the afternoon of\r\nthe day in which i myself had eloped but in a brief period i ceased\r\nto think upon the subject my attention being all absorbed in a\r\ncontemplated departure for oxford thither i soon went the\r\nuncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and\r\nannual establishment which would enable me to indulge at will in the\r\nluxury already so dear to my hearto vie in profuseness of\r\nexpenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in\r\ngreat britain\r\n\r\nexcited by such appliances to vice my constitutional temperament\r\nbroke forth with redoubled ardor and i spurned even the common\r\nrestraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels but it were\r\nabsurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance let it suffice that\r\namong spendthrifts i outheroded herod and that giving name to a\r\nmultitude of novel follies i added no brief appendix to the long\r\ncatalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of\r\neurope\r\n\r\nit could hardly be credited however that i had even here so utterly\r\nfallen from the gentlemanly estate as to seek acquaintance with the\r\nvilest arts of the gambler by profession and having become an adept\r\nin his despicable science to practise it habitually as a means of\r\nincreasing my already enormous income at the expense of the\r\nweakminded among my fellowcollegians such nevertheless was the\r\nfact and the very enormity of this offence against all manly and\r\nhonorable sentiment proved beyond doubt the main if not the sole\r\nreason of the impunity with which it was committed  who indeed\r\namong my most abandoned associates would not rather have disputed the\r\nclearest evidence of his senses than have suspected of such courses\r\nthe gay the frank the generous william wilsonthe noblest and most\r\nliberal commoner at oxford him whose follies said his parasites\r\nwere but the follies of youth and unbridled fancywhose errors but\r\ninimitable whimwhose darkest vice but a careless and dashing\r\nextravagance\r\n\r\ni had been now two years successfully busied in this way when there\r\ncame to the university a young parvenu nobleman glendinningrich\r\nsaid report as herodes atticushis riches too as easily\r\nacquired i soon found him of weak intellect and of course marked him\r\nas a fitting subject for my skill i frequently engaged him in play\r\nand contrived with the gamblers usual art to let him win\r\nconsiderable sums the more effectually to entangle him in my\r\nsnares at length my schemes being ripe i met him with the full\r\nintention that this meeting should be final and decisive at the\r\nchambers of a fellowcommoner mr preston equally intimate with\r\nboth but who to do him justice entertained not even a remote\r\nsuspicion of my design to give to this a better coloring i had\r\ncontrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten and was\r\nsolicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear\r\naccidental and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe\r\nhimself to be brief upon a vile topic none of the low finesse was\r\nomitted so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter\r\nfor wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim\r\n\r\nwe had protracted our sitting far into the night and i had at length\r\neffected the manoeuvre of getting glendinning as my sole\r\nantagonist the game too was my favorite écarté the rest of the\r\ncompany interested in the extent of our play had abandoned their own\r\ncards and were standing around us as spectators the parvenu who\r\nhad been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening to\r\ndrink deeply now shuffled dealt or played with a wild nervousness\r\nof manner for which his intoxication i thought might partially but\r\ncould not altogether account in a very short period he had become my\r\ndebtor to a large amount when having taken a long draught of port\r\nhe did precisely what i had been coolly anticipatinghe proposed to\r\ndouble our already extravagant stakes  with a wellfeigned show of\r\nreluctance and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him\r\ninto some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance\r\ndid i finally comply  the result of course did but prove how\r\nentirely the prey was in my toils in less than an hour he had\r\nquadrupled his debt  for some time his countenance had been losing\r\nthe florid tinge lent it by the wine but now to my astonishment i\r\nperceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful i say to my\r\nastonishment glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries\r\nas immeasurably wealthy and the sums which he had as yet lost\r\nalthough in themselves vast could not i supposed very seriously\r\nannoy much less so violently affect him that he was overcome by the\r\nwine just swallowed was the idea which most readily presented itself\r\nand rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the\r\neyes of my associates than from any less interested motive i was\r\nabout to insist peremptorily upon a discontinuance of the play when\r\nsome expressions at my elbow from among the company and an\r\nejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of glendinning gave me\r\nto understand that i had effected his total ruin under circumstances\r\nwhich rendering him an object for the pity of all should have\r\nprotected him from the ill offices even of a fiend\r\n\r\nwhat now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say  the\r\npitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom\r\nover all and for some moments a profound silence was maintained\r\nduring which i could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many\r\nburning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less\r\nabandoned of the party i will even own that an intolerable weight of\r\nanxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and\r\nextraordinary interruption which ensued the wide heavy foldingdoors\r\nof the apartment were all at once thrown open to their full extent\r\nwith a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished as if by\r\nmagic every candle in the room their light in dying enabled us\r\njust to perceive that a stranger had entered about my own height and\r\nclosely muffled in a cloak the darkness however was now total and\r\nwe could only feel that he was standing in our midst before any one\r\nof us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this\r\nrudeness had thrown all we heard the voice of the intruder\r\n\r\ngentlemen he said in a low distinct and nevertobeforgotten\r\nwhisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones gentlmen i\r\nmake no apology for this behavior because in thus behaving i am but\r\nfulfilling a duty you are beyond doubt uninformed of the true\r\ncharacter of the person who has tonight won at écarté a large sum\r\nof money from lord glendinning i will therefore put you upon an\r\nexpeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary\r\ninformation please to examine at your leisure the inner linings of\r\nthe cuff of his left sleeve and the several little packages which may\r\nbe found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning\r\nwrapper\r\n\r\nwhile he spoke so profound was the stillness that one might have\r\nheard a pin drop upon the floor in ceasing he departed at once and\r\nas abruptly as he had entered can ishall i describe my sensations\r\nmust i say that i felt all the horrors of the damned most assuredly i\r\nhad little time for reflection many hands roughly seized me upon the\r\nspot and lights were immediately reprocured a search ensued in the\r\nlining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in\r\nécarté and in the pockets of my wrapper a number of packs\r\nfacsimiles of those used at our sittings with the single exception\r\nthat mine were of the species called technically arrondis the\r\nhonors being slightly convex at the ends the lower cards slightly\r\nconvex at the sides in this disposition the dupe who cuts as\r\ncustomary at the length of the pack will invariably find that he\r\ncuts his antagonist an honor while the gambler cutting at the\r\nbreadth will as certainly cut nothing for his victim which may\r\ncount in the records of the game\r\n\r\nany burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me\r\nless than the silent contempt or the sarcastic composure with which\r\nit was received\r\n\r\nmr wilson said our host stooping to remove from beneath his feet\r\nan exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs mr wilson this is your\r\nproperty  the weather was cold and upon quitting my own room i\r\nhad thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper putting it off upon\r\nreaching the scene of play i presume it is supererogatory to seek\r\nhere eying the folds of the garment with a bitter smile for any\r\nfarther evidence of your skill indeed we have had enough you will\r\nsee the necessity i hope of quitting oxfordat all events of\r\nquitting instantly my chambers\r\n\r\nabased humbled to the dust as i then was it is probable that i\r\nshould have resented this galling language by immediate personal\r\nviolence had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a\r\nfact of the most startling character the cloak which i had worn was\r\nof a rare description of fur how rare how extravagantly costly i\r\nshall not venture to say its fashion too was of my own fantastic\r\ninvention for i was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry in\r\nmatters of this frivolous nature when therefore mr preston reached\r\nme that which he had picked up upon the floor and near the\r\nfoldingdoors of the apartment it was with an astonishment nearly\r\nbordering upon terror that i perceived my own already hanging on my\r\narm where i had no doubt unwittingly placed it and that the one\r\npresented me was but its exact counterpart in every in even the\r\nminutest possible particular the singular being who had so\r\ndisastrously exposed me had been muffled i remembered in a cloak\r\nand none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with\r\nthe exception of myself retaining some presence of mind i took the\r\none offered me by preston placed it unnoticed over my own left the\r\napartment with a resolute scowl of defiance and next morning ere\r\ndawn of day commenced a hurried journey from oxford to the continent\r\nin a perfect agony of horror and of shame\r\n\r\n\r\ni fled in vain my evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation and\r\nproved indeed that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as\r\nyet only begun scarcely had i set foot in paris ere i had fresh\r\nevidence of the detestable interest taken by this wilson in my\r\nconcerns years flew while i experienced no relief villainat\r\nrome with how untimely yet with how spectral an officiousness\r\nstepped he in between me and my ambition at vienna tooat\r\nberlinand at moscow  where in truth had i not bitter cause to\r\ncurse him within my heart from his inscrutable tyranny did i at\r\nlength flee panicstricken as from a pestilence and to the very\r\nends of the earth i fled in vain\r\n\r\nand again and again in secret communion with my own spirit would i\r\ndemand the questions who is hewhence came heand what are his\r\nobjects but no answer was there found and now i scrutinized with a\r\nminute scrutiny the forms and the methods and the leading traits of\r\nhis impertinent supervision but even here there was very little upon\r\nwhich to base a conjecture it was noticeable indeed that in no one\r\nof the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path\r\nhad he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes or to disturb\r\nthose actions which if fully carried out might have resulted in\r\nbitter mischief poor justification this in truth for an authority\r\nso imperiously assumed poor indemnity for natural rights of\r\nselfagency so pertinaciously so insultingly denied\r\n\r\ni had also been forced to notice that my tormentor for a very long\r\nperiod of time while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity\r\nmaintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself had so\r\ncontrived it in the execution of his varied interference with my\r\nwill that i saw not at any moment the features of his face be\r\nwilson what he might this at least was but the veriest of\r\naffectation or of folly could he for an instant have supposed\r\nthat in my admonisher at etonin the destroyer of my honor at\r\noxfordin him who thwarted my ambition at rome my revenge at paris\r\nmy passionate love at naples or what he falsely termed my avarice in\r\negyptthat in this my archenemy and evil genius i could fail to\r\nrecognize the william wilson of my schoolboy days the namesake the\r\ncompanion the rival the hated and dreaded rival at dr bransbys\r\nimpossiblebut let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the\r\ndrama\r\n\r\nthus far i had succumbed suginely to this imperious domination the\r\nsentiment of deep awe with which i habitually regarded the elevated\r\ncharacter the majestic wisdom the apparent omnipresence and\r\nomnipotence of wilson added to a feeling of even terror with which\r\ncertain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me had\r\noperated hitherto to impress me with an idea of my own utter\r\nweakness and helplessness and to suggest an implicit although\r\nbitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will  but of late\r\ndays i had given myself up entirely to wine and its maddening\r\ninfluence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more\r\nimpatient of control i began to murmur to hesitate to resist  and\r\nwas it only fancy which induced me to believe that with the increase\r\nof my own firmness that of my tormentor underwent a proportional\r\ndiminution be this as it may i now began to feel the inspiration of\r\na burning hope and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern\r\nand desperate resolution that i would submit no longer to be enslaved\r\n\r\nit was at rome during the carnival of  that i attended a\r\nmasquerade in the palazzo of the neapolitan duke di broglio i had\r\nindulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the winetable and\r\nnow the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me\r\nbeyond endurance the difficulty too of forcing my way through the\r\nmazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my\r\ntemper for i was anxiously seeking let me not say with what unworthy\r\nmotive the young the gay the beautiful wife of the aged and doting\r\ndi broglio with a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously\r\ncommunicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be\r\nhabited and now having caught a glimpse of her person i was\r\nhurrying to make my way into her presence at this moment i felt a\r\nlight hand placed upon my shoulder and that everremembered low\r\ndamnable whisper within my ear\r\n\r\nin an absolute frenzy of wrath i turned at once upon him who had thus\r\ninterrupted me and seized him violently by the collar he was\r\nattired as i had expected in a costume altogether similar to my own\r\nwearing a spanish cloak of blue velvet begirt about the waist with a\r\ncrimson belt sustaining a rapier a mask of black silk entirely\r\ncovered his face\r\n\r\nscoundrel i said in a voice husky with rage while every syllable\r\ni uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury scoundrel impostor\r\naccursed villain you shall notyou shall not dog me unto death\r\nfollow me or i stab you where you standand i broke my way from\r\nthe ballroom into a small antechamber adjoining dragging him\r\nunresistingly with me as i went\r\n\r\nupon entering i thrust him furiously from me he staggered against\r\nthe wall while i closed the door with an oath and commanded him to\r\ndraw he hesitated but for an instant then with a slight sigh drew\r\nin silence and put himself upon his defence\r\n\r\nthe contest was brief indeed i was frantic with every species of wild\r\nexcitement and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a\r\nmultitude in a few seconds i forced him by sheer strength against the\r\nwainscoting and thus getting him at mercy plunged my sword with\r\nbrute ferocity repeatedly through and through his bosom\r\n\r\nat that instant some person tried the latch of the door i hastened to\r\nprevent an intrusion and then immediately returned to my dying\r\nantagonist but what human language can adequately portray that\r\nastonishment that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then\r\npresented to view the brief moment in which i averted my eyes had\r\nbeen sufficient to produce apparently a material change in the\r\narrangements at the upper or farther end of the room a large\r\nmirrorso at first it seemed to me in my confusionnow stood where\r\nnone had been perceptible before and as i stepped up to it in\r\nextremity of terror mine own image but with features all pale and\r\ndabbled in blood advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering\r\ngait\r\n\r\nthus it appeared i say but was not it was my antagonistit was\r\nwilson who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution\r\nhis mask and cloak lay where he had thrown them upon the floor not\r\na thread in all his raimentnot a line in all the marked and singular\r\nlineaments of his face which was not even in the most absolute\r\nidentity mine own\r\n\r\nit was wilson but he spoke no longer in a whisper and i could have\r\nfancied that i myself was speaking while he said\r\n\r\nyou have conquered and i yield yet henceforward art thou also\r\ndeaddead to the world to heaven and to hope in me didst thou\r\nexistand in my death see by this image which is thine own how\r\nutterly thou hast murdered thyself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na descent into the maelström\r\n\r\n  the ways of god in nature as in

exhausted to speak\r\n\r\nnot long ago said he at length and i could have guided you on\r\nthis route as well as the youngest of my sons but about three years\r\npast there happened to me an event such as never happened before to\r\nmortal manor at least such as no man ever survived to tell ofand\r\nthe six hours of deadly terror which i then endured have broken me up\r\nbody and soul you suppose me a very old manbut i am not it took\r\nless than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to\r\nwhite to weaken my limbs and to unstring my nerves so that i\r\ntremble at the

thrown\r\nhimself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over\r\nit while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on\r\nits extreme and slippery edgethis little cliff arose a sheer\r\nunobstructed precipice of black shining rock some fifteen or sixteen\r\nhundred feet from the world of crags beneath us nothing would have\r\ntempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink in truth so\r\ndeeply was i excited by the perilous position of my companion that i\r\nfell at full length upon the ground clung to the shrubs around me\r\nand dared not even glance upward at the skywhile i struggled in vain\r\nto divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain\r\nwere in danger from the fury of the winds it was long before i could\r\nreason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the\r\ndistance\r\n\r\nyou must get over these fancies said the guide for i have brought\r\nyou here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of\r\nthat event i mentionedand to tell you the whole story with the spot\r\njust under your eye\r\n\r\nwe are now he continued in that particularizing manner which\r\ndistinguished himwe are now close upon the norwegian coastin the\r\nsixtyeighth degree of latitudein the great province of\r\nnordlandand in the dreary district of lofoden the mountain upon\r\nwhose top we sit is helseggen the cloudy now raise yourself up a\r\nlittle higherhold on to the grass if you feel giddysoand look\r\nout beyond the belt of vapor beneath us into the sea\r\n\r\ni looked dizzily and beheld a wide expanse of ocean whose waters\r\nwore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the nubian\r\ngeographers account of the mare tenebrarum a panorama more\r\ndeplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive to the right\r\nand left as far as the eye could reach there lay outstretched like\r\nramparts of the world lines of horridly black and beetling cliff\r\nwhose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the\r\nsurf which reared high up against it its white and ghastly crest\r\nhowling and shrieking forever just opposite the promontory upon whose\r\napex we were placed and at a distance of some five or six miles out\r\nat sea there was visible a small bleaklooking island or more\r\nproperly its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge\r\nin which it was enveloped about two miles nearer the land arose\r\nanother of smaller size hideously craggy and barren and encompassed\r\nat various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks\r\n\r\nthe appearance of the ocean in the space between the more distant\r\nisland and the shore had something very unusual about it although\r\nat the time so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the\r\nremote offing lay to under a doublereefed trysail and constantly\r\nplunged her whole hull out of sight still there was here nothing like\r\na regular swell but only a short quick angry cross dashing of water\r\nin every directionas well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise of\r\nfoam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks\r\n\r\nthe island in the distance resumed the old man is called by the\r\nnorwegians vurrgh the one midway is moskoe  that a mile to the\r\nnorthward is ambaaren yonder are iflesen hoeyholm kieldholm\r\nsuarven and buckholm  farther offbetween moskoe and vurrghare\r\notterholm flimen sandflesen and skarholm these are the true names\r\nof the placesbut why it has been thought necessary to name them at\r\nall is more than either you or i can understand do you hear anything\r\ndo you see any change in the water\r\n\r\nwe had now been about ten minutes upon the top of helseggen to which\r\nwe had ascended from the interior of lofoden so that we had caught no\r\nglimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit as the\r\nold man spoke i became aware of a loud and gradually increasing\r\nsound like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an american\r\nprairie and at the same moment i perceived that what seamen term the\r\nchopping character of the ocean beneath us was rapidly changing\r\ninto a current which set to the eastward  even while i gazed this\r\ncurrent acquired a monstrous velocity  each moment added to its\r\nspeedto its headlong impetuosity  in five minutes the whole sea as\r\nfar as vurrgh was lashed into ungovernable fury but it was between\r\nmoskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway here the vast\r\nbed of the waters seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting\r\nchannels burst suddenly into frenzied convulsionheaving boiling\r\nhissinggyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices and all\r\nwhirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water\r\nnever elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents\r\n\r\nin a few minutes more there came over the scene another radical\r\nalteration the general surface grew somewhat more smooth and the\r\nwhirlpools one by one disappeared while prodigious streaks of foam\r\nbecame apparent where none had been seen before these streaks at\r\nlength spreading out to a great distance and entering into\r\ncombination took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided\r\nvortices and seemed to form the germ of another more\r\nvast suddenlyvery suddenlythis assumed a distinct and definite\r\nexistence in a circle of more than a mile in diameter the edge of\r\nthe whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray but no\r\nparticle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel whose\r\ninterior as far as the eye could fathom it was a smooth shining\r\nand jetblack wall of water inclined to the horizon at an angle of\r\nsome fortyfive degrees speeding dizzily round and round with a\r\nswaying and sweltering motion and sending forth to the winds an\r\nappalling voice half shriek half roar such as not even the mighty\r\ncataract of niagara ever lifts up in its agony to heaven\r\n\r\nthe mountain trembled to its very base and the rock rocked i threw\r\nmyself upon my face and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of\r\nnervous agitation\r\n\r\nthis said i at length to the old manthis can be nothing else\r\nthan the great whirlpool of the maelström\r\n\r\nso it is sometimes termed said he we norwegians call it the\r\nmoskoeström from the island of moskoe in the midway  the ordinary\r\naccounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what i\r\nsaw that of jonas ramus which is perhaps the most circumstantial of\r\nany cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence\r\nor of the horror of the sceneor of the wild bewildering sense of\r\nthe novel which confounds the beholder i am not sure from what\r\npoint of view the writer in question surveyed it nor at what time\r\nbut it could neither have been from the summit of helseggen nor\r\nduring a storm there are some passages of his description\r\nnevertheless which may be quoted for their details although their\r\neffect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the\r\nspectacle\r\n\r\nbetween lofoden and moskoe he says the depth of the water is\r\nbetween thirtysix and forty fathoms but on the other side toward\r\nver vurrgh this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient\r\npassage for a vessel without the risk of splitting on the rocks\r\nwhich happens even in the calmest weather when it is flood the\r\nstream runs up the country between lofoden and moskoe with a\r\nboisterous rapidity but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is\r\nscarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts the noise\r\nbeing heard several leagues off and the vortices or pits are of such\r\nan extent and depth that if a ship comes within its attraction it is\r\ninevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom and there beat to\r\npieces against the rocks and when the water relaxes the fragments\r\nthereof are thrown up again but these intervals of tranquillity are\r\nonly at the turn of the ebb and flood and in calm weather and last\r\nbut a quarter of an hour its violence gradually returning when the\r\nstream is most boisterous and its fury heightened by a storm it is\r\ndangerous to come within a norway mile of it boats yachts and ships\r\nhave been carried away by not guarding against it before they were\r\nwithin its reach  it likewise happens frequently that whales come too\r\nnear the stream and are overpowered by its violence and then it is\r\nimpossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their\r\nfruitless struggles to disengage themselves a bear once attempting\r\nto swim from lofoden to moskoe was caught by the stream and borne\r\ndown while he roared terribly so as to be heard on shore large\r\nstocks of firs and pine trees after being absorbed by the current\r\nrise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon\r\nthem this plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks among\r\nwhich they are whirled to and fro this stream is regulated by the\r\nflux and reflux of the seait being constantly high and low water\r\nevery six hours in the year  early in the morning of sexagesima\r\nsunday it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones\r\nof the houses on the coast fell to the ground\r\n\r\nin regard to the depth of the water i could not see how this could\r\nhave been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nvortex the forty fathoms must have reference only to portions of\r\nthe channel close upon the shore either of moskoe or lofoden  the\r\ndepth in the centre of the moskoeström must be immeasurably greater\r\nand no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained\r\nfrom even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be\r\nhad from the highest crag of helseggen looking down from this\r\npinnacle upon the howling phlegethon below i could not help smiling\r\nat the simplicity with which the honest jonas ramus records as a\r\nmatter difficult of belief the anecdotes of the whales and the bears\r\nfor it appeared to me in fact a selfevident thing that the largest\r\nships of the line in existence coming within the influence of that\r\ndeadly attraction could resist it as little as a feather the\r\nhurricane and must disappear bodily and at once\r\n\r\nthe attempts to account for the phenomenonsome of which i remember\r\nseemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusalnow wore a very\r\ndifferent and unsatisfactory aspect  the idea generally received is\r\nthat this as well as three smaller vortices among the feroe islands\r\nhave no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling\r\nat flux and reflux against a ridge of rocks and shelves which\r\nconfines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract and\r\nthus the higher the flood rises the deeper must the fall be and the\r\nnatural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex the prodigious suction\r\nof which is sufficiently known by lesser experimentsthese are the\r\nwords of the encyclopædia britannica kircher and others imagine\r\nthat in the centre of the channel of the maelström is an abyss\r\npenetrating the globe and issuing in some very remote partthe gulf\r\nof bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance  this\r\nopinion idle in itself was the one to which as i gazed my\r\nimagination most readily assented and mentioning it to the guide i\r\nwas rather surprised to hear him say that although it was the view\r\nalmost universally entertained of the subject by the norwegians it\r\nnevertheless was not his own as to the former notion he confessed his\r\ninability to comprehend it and here i agreed with himfor however\r\nconclusive on paper it becomes altogether unintelligible and even\r\nabsurd amid the thunder of the abyss\r\n\r\nyou have had a good look at the whirl now said the old man and if\r\nyou will creep round this crag so as to get in its lee and deaden\r\nthe roar of the water i will tell you a story that will convince you\r\ni ought to know something of the moskoeström\r\n\r\ni placed myself as desired and he proceeded\r\n\r\nmyself and my two brothers once owned a schoonerrigged smack of\r\nabout seventy tons burden with which we were in the habit of fishing\r\namong the islands beyond moskoe nearly to vurrgh in all violent\r\neddies at sea there is good fishing at proper opportunities if one\r\nhas only the courage to attempt it but among the whole of the lofoden\r\ncoastmen we three were the only ones who made a regular business of\r\ngoing out to the islands as i tell you the usual grounds are a great\r\nway lower down to the southward there fish can be got at all hours\r\nwithout much risk and therefore these places are preferred the\r\nchoice spots over here among the rocks however not only yield the\r\nfinest variety but in far greater abundance so that we often got in\r\na single day what the more timid of the craft could not scrape\r\ntogether in a week  in fact we made it a matter of desperate\r\nspeculationthe risk of life standing instead of labor and courage\r\nanswering for capital\r\n\r\nwe kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than\r\nthis and it was our practice in fine weather to take advantage of\r\nthe fifteen minutes slack to push across the main channel of the\r\nmoskoeström far above the pool and then drop down upon anchorage\r\nsomewhere near otterholm or sandflesen where the eddies are not so\r\nviolent as elsewhere here we used to remain until nearly time for\r\nslackwater again when we weighed and made for home we never set out\r\nupon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and\r\ncomingone that we felt sure would not fail us before our returnand\r\nwe seldom made a miscalculation upon this point twice during six\r\nyears we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead\r\ncalm which is a rare thing indeed just about here and once we had to\r\nremain on the grounds nearly a week starving to death owing to a\r\ngale which blew up shortly after our arrival and made the channel too\r\nboisterous to be thought of upon this occasion we should have been\r\ndriven out to sea in spite of everything for the whirlpools threw us\r\nround and round so violently that at length we fouled our anchor\r\nand dragged it if it had not been that we drifted into one of the\r\ninnumerable cross currentshere today and gone tomorrowwhich\r\ndrove us under the lee of flimen where by good luck we brought up\r\n\r\ni could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we\r\nencountered on the groundit is a bad spot to be in even in good\r\nweatherbut we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the\r\nmoskoeström itself without accident although at times my heart has\r\nbeen in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or\r\nbefore the slack the wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought\r\nit at starting and then we made rather less way than we could wish\r\nwhile the current rendered the smack unmanageable my eldest brother\r\nhad a son eighteen years old and i had two stout boys of my\r\nown these would have been of great assistance at such times in using\r\nthe sweeps as well as afterward in fishingbut somehow although we\r\nran the risk ourselves we had not the heart to let the young ones get\r\ninto the dangerfor after all said and done it was a horrible\r\ndanger and that is the truth\r\n\r\nit is now within a few days of three years since what i am going to\r\ntell you occurred it was on the tenth of july  a day which the\r\npeople of this part of the world will never forgetfor it was one in\r\nwhich blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the\r\nheavens and yet all the morning and indeed until late in the\r\nafternoon there was a gentle and steady breeze from the southwest\r\nwhile the sun shone brightly so that the oldest seamen among us could\r\nnot have forseen what was to follow\r\n\r\nthe three of usmy two brothers and myselfhad crossed over to the\r\nislands about two oclock pm and soon nearly loaded the smack with\r\nfine fish which we all remarked were more plenty that day than we\r\nhad ever known them it was just seven by my watch when we weighed\r\nand started for home so as to make the worst of the ström at slack\r\nwater which we knew would be at eight\r\n\r\nwe set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter and for some\r\ntime spanked along at a great rate never dreaming of danger for\r\nindeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it all at once we\r\nwere taken aback by a breeze from over helseggen this was most\r\nunusualsomething that had never happened to us beforeand i began\r\nto feel a little uneasy without exactly knowing why we put the boat\r\non the wind but could make no headway at all for the eddies and i\r\nwas upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage when\r\nlooking astern we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular\r\ncoppercolored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity\r\n\r\nin the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away and we\r\nwere dead becalmed drifting about in every direction this state of\r\nthings however did not last long enough to give us time to think\r\nabout it in less than a minute the storm was upon usin less than\r\ntwo the sky was entirely overcastand what with this and the driving\r\nspray it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in\r\nthe smack\r\n\r\nsuch a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing the\r\noldest seaman in norway never experienced anything like it we had let\r\nour sails go by the run before it cleverly took us but at the first\r\npuff both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed\r\noffthe mainmast taking with it my youngest brother who had lashed\r\nhimself to it for safety\r\n\r\nour boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon\r\nwater it had a complete flush deck with only a small hatch near the\r\nbow and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when\r\nabout to cross the ström by way of precaution against the chopping\r\nseas but for this circumstance we should have foundered at oncefor\r\nwe lay entirely buried for some moments how my elder brother escaped\r\ndestruction i cannot say for i never had an opportunity of\r\nascertaining for my part as soon as i had let the foresail run i\r\nthrew myself flat on deck with my feet against the narrow gunwale of\r\nthe bow and with my hands grasping a ringbolt near the foot of the\r\nforemast it was mere instinct that prompted me to do thiswhich was\r\nundoubtedly the very best thing i could have donefor i was too much\r\nflurried to think\r\n\r\nfor some moments we were completely deluged as i say and all this\r\ntime i held my breath and clung to the bolt  when i could stand it\r\nno longer i raised myself upon my knees still keeping hold with my\r\nhands and thus got my head clear presently our little boat gave\r\nherself a shake just as a dog does in coming out of the water and\r\nthus rid herself in some measure of the seas i was now trying to\r\nget the better of the stupor that had come over me and to collect my\r\nsenses so as to see what was to be done when i felt somebody grasp my\r\narm it was my elder brother and my heart leaped for joy for i had\r\nmade sure that he was overboardbut the next moment all this joy was\r\nturned into horrorfor he put his mouth close to my ear and screamed\r\nout the word moskoeström\r\n\r\nno onewill ever know what my feelings were at that moment i shook\r\nfrom head to foot as if i had had the most violent fit of the ague i\r\nknew what he meant by that one word well enoughi knew what he wished\r\nto make me understand with the wind that now drove us on we were\r\nbound for the whirl of the ström and nothing could save us\r\n\r\nyou perceive that in crossing the ström channel we always went a\r\nlong way up above the whirl even in the calmest weather and then had\r\nto wait and watch carefully for the slackbut now we were driving\r\nright upon the pool itself and in such a hurricane as this to be\r\nsure i thought we shall get there just about the slackthere is\r\nsome little hope in thatbut in the next moment i cursed myself for\r\nbeing so great a fool as to dream of hope at all i knew very well\r\nthat we were doomed had we been ten times a ninetygun ship\r\n\r\nby this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself or\r\nperhaps we did not feel it so much as we scudded before it but at all\r\nevents the seas which at first had been kept down by the wind and\r\nlay flat and frothing now got up into absolute mountains a singular\r\nchange too had come over the heavens around in every direction it\r\nwas still as black as pitch but nearly overhead there burst out all\r\nat once a circular rift of clear skyas clear as i ever sawand of\r\na deep bright blueand through it there blazed forth the full moon\r\nwith a lustre that i never before knew her to wear she lit up\r\neverything about us with the greatest distinctnessbut oh god what\r\na scene it was to light up\r\n\r\ni now made one or two attempts to speak to my brotherbut in some\r\nmanner which i could not understand the din had so increased that i\r\ncould not make him hear a single word although i screamed at the top\r\nof my voice in his ear  presently he shook his head looking as pale\r\nas death and held up one of his fingers as if to say listen\r\n\r\nat first i could not make out what he meantbut soon a hideous\r\nthought flashed upon me i dragged my watch from its fob it was not\r\ngoing i glanced at its face by the moonlight and then burst into\r\ntears as i flung it far away into the ocean it had run down at seven\r\noclock we were behind the time of the slack and the whirl of the\r\nström was in full fury\r\n\r\nwhen a boat is well built properly trimmed and not deep laden the\r\nwaves in a strong gale when she is going large seem always to slip\r\nfrom beneath herwhich appears very strange to a landsmanand this\r\nis what is called riding in sea phrase\r\n\r\nwell so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly but presently a\r\ngigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter and bore us\r\nwith it as it roseupupas if into the sky i would not have\r\nbelieved that any wave could rise so high and then down we came with\r\na sweep a slide and a plunge that made me feel sick and dizzy as\r\nif i was falling from some lofty mountaintop in a dream but while we\r\nwere up i had thrown a quick glance aroundand that one glance was\r\nall sufficient i saw our exact position in an instant the\r\nmoskoeström whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead aheadbut\r\nno more like the everyday moskoeström than the whirl as you now see\r\nit is like a millrace if i had not known where we were and what we\r\nhad to expect i should not have recognized the place at all as it\r\nwas i involuntarily closed my eyes in horror the lids clenched\r\nthemselves together as if in a spasm\r\n\r\nit could not have been more than two minutes afterwards until we\r\nsuddenly felt the waves subside and were enveloped in foam the boat\r\nmade a sharp half turn to larboard and then shot off in its new\r\ndirection like a thunderbolt at the same moment the roaring noise of\r\nthe water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shrieksuch a\r\nsound as you might imagine given out by the waterpipes of many\r\nthousand steamvessels letting off their steam all together we were\r\nnow in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl and i\r\nthought of course that another moment would plunge us into the\r\nabyssdown which we could only see indistinctly on account of the\r\namazing velocity with which we were borne along the boat did not seem\r\nto sink into the water at all but to skim like an airbubble upon the\r\nsurface of the surge her starboard side was next the whirl and on\r\nthe larboard arose the world of ocean we had left it stood like a\r\nhuge writhing wall between us and the horizon\r\n\r\nit may appear strange but now when we were in the very jaws of the\r\ngulf i felt more composed than when we were only approaching\r\nit having made up my mind to hope no more i got rid of a great deal\r\nof that terror which unmanned me at first i suppose it was despair\r\nthat strung my nerves\r\n\r\nit may look like boastingbut what i tell you is truthi began to\r\nreflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner and\r\nhow foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my\r\nown individual life in view of so wonderful a manifestation of gods\r\npower i do believe that i blushed with shame when this idea crossed\r\nmy mind after a little while i became possessed with the keenest\r\ncuriosity about the whirl itself i positively felt a wish to\r\nexplore its depths even at the sacrifice i was going to make and my\r\nprincipal grief was that i should never be able to tell my old\r\ncompanions on shore about the mysteries i should see these no doubt\r\nwere singular fancies to occupy a mans mind in such extremityand i\r\nhave often thought since that the revolutions of the boat around the\r\npool might have rendered me a little lightheaded\r\n\r\nthere was another circumstance which tended to restore my\r\nselfpossession and this was the cessation of the wind which could\r\nnot reach us in our present situationfor as you saw yourself the\r\nbelt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean\r\nand this latter now towered above us a high black mountainous\r\nridge if you have never been at sea in a heavy gale you can form no\r\nidea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray\r\ntogether they blind deafen and strangle you and take away all\r\npower of action or reflection  but we were now in a great measure\r\nrid of these annoyancesjust as deathcondemned felons in prison are\r\nallowed petty indulgences forbidden them while their doom is yet\r\nuncertain\r\n\r\nhow often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say we\r\ncareered round and round for perhaps an hour flying rather than\r\nfloating getting gradually more and more into the middle of the\r\nsurge and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge all this\r\ntime i had never let go of the ringbolt my brother was at stern\r\nholding on to a small empty watercask which had been securely lashed\r\nunder the coop of the counter and was the only thing on deck that had\r\nnot been swept overboard when the gale first took us as we approached\r\nthe brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this and made for the\r\nring from which in the agony of his terror he endeavored to force\r\nmy hands as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure\r\ngrasp i never felt deeper grief than when i saw him attempt this\r\nactalthough i new he was a madman when he did ita raving maniac\r\nthrough sheer fright i did not care however to contest the point\r\nwith him i knew it could make no diference whether either of us held\r\non at all so i let him have the bolt and went astern to the\r\ncask this there was no great difficulty in doing for the smack flew\r\nround steadily enough and upon an even keelonly swaying to and fro\r\nwith the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl  scarcely had i\r\nsecured myself in my new position when we gave a wild lurch to\r\nstarboard and rushed headlong into the abyss i muttered a hurried\r\nprayer to god and thought all was over\r\n\r\nas i felt the sickening sweep of the descent i had instinctively\r\ntightened my hold upon the barrel and closed my eyes for some\r\nseconds i dared not open themwhile i expected instant destruction\r\nand wondered that i was not already in my deathstruggles with the\r\nwater but moment after moment elapsed i still lived the sense of\r\nfalling had ceased and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had\r\nbeen before while in the belt of foam with the exception that she\r\nnow lay more along i took courage and looked once again upon the\r\nscene\r\n\r\nnever shall i forget the sensations of awe horror and admiration\r\nwith which i gazed about me the boat appeared to be hanging as if by\r\nmagic midway down upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in\r\ncircumference prodigious in depth and whose perfectly smooth sides\r\nmight have been mistaken for ebony but for the bewildering rapidity\r\nwith which they spun around and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance\r\nthey shot forth as the rays of the full moon from that circular rift\r\namid the clouds which i have already described streamed in a flood\r\nof golden glory along the black walls and far away down into the\r\ninmost recesses of the abyss\r\n\r\nat first i was too much confused to observe anything accurately the\r\ngeneral burst of terrific grandeur was all that i beheld when i\r\nrecovered myself a little however my gaze fell instinctively\r\ndownward in this direction i was able to obtain an unobstructed view\r\nfrom the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the\r\npool she was quite upon an even keelthat is to say her deck lay in\r\na plane parallel with that of the waterbut this latter sloped at an\r\nangle of more than fortyfive degrees so that we seemed to be lying\r\nupon our beamends i could not help observing nevertheless that i\r\nhad scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in\r\nthis situation than if we had been upon a dead level and this i\r\nsuppose was owing to the speed at which we revolved\r\n\r\nthe rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound\r\ngulf but still i could make out nothing distinctly on account of a\r\nthick mist in which everything there was enveloped and over which\r\nthere hung a magnificent rainbow like that narrow and tottering\r\nbridge which mussulmans say is the only pathway between time and\r\neternity this mist or spray was no doubt occasioned by the clashing\r\nof the great walls of the funnel as they all met together at the\r\nbottombut the yell that went up to the heavens from out of that\r\nmist i dare not attempt to describe\r\n\r\nour first slide into the abyss itself from the belt of foam above\r\nhad carried us to a great distance down the slope but our farther\r\ndescent was by no means proportionate round and round we sweptnot\r\nwith any uniform movement but in dizzying swings and jerks that sent\r\nus sometimes only a few hundred yardssometimes nearly the complete\r\ncircuit of the whirl our progress downward at each revolution was\r\nslow but very perceptible\r\n\r\nlooking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were\r\nthus borne i perceived that our boat was not the only object in the\r\nembrace of the whirl both above and below us were visible fragments\r\nof vessels large masses of building timber and trunks of trees with\r\nmany smaller articles such as pieces of house furniture broken\r\nboxes barrels and staves i have already described the unnatural\r\ncuriosity which had taken the place of my original terrors it\r\nappeared to grow upon me as i drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful\r\ndoom i now began to watch with a strange interest the numerous\r\nthings that floated in our company i must have been deliriousfor\r\ni even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities\r\nof their several descents toward the foam below this fir tree i\r\nfound myself at one time saying will certainly be the next thing\r\nthat takes the awful plunge and disappearsand then i was\r\ndisappointed to find that the wreck of a dutch merchant ship overtook\r\nit and went down before at length after making several guesses of\r\nthis nature and being deceived in allthis factthe fact of my\r\ninvariable miscalculation set me upon a train of reflection that made\r\nmy limbs again tremble and my heart beat heavily once more\r\n\r\nit was not a new terror that thus affected me but the dawn of a more\r\nexciting hope this hope arose partly from memory and partly from\r\npresent observation i called to mind the great variety of buoyant\r\nmatter that strewed the coast of lofoden having been absorbed and\r\nthen thrown forth by the moskoeström by far the greater number of\r\nthe articles were shattered in the most extraordinary wayso chafed\r\nand roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of\r\nsplintersbut then i distinctly recollected that there were some of\r\nthem which were not disfigured at all now i could not account for\r\nthis difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were\r\nthe only ones which had been completely absorbedthat the others\r\nhad entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide or from some\r\nreason had descended so slowly after entering that they did not\r\nreach the bottom before the turn of the flood came or of the ebb as\r\nthe case might be i conceived it possible in either instance that\r\nthey might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean without\r\nundergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early or\r\nabsorbed more rapidly i made also three important observations the\r\nfirst was that as a general rule the larger the bodies were the\r\nmore rapid their descent the second that between two masses of\r\nequal extent the one spherical and the other of any other shape\r\nthe superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere the third\r\nthat between two masses of equal size the one cylindrical and the\r\nother of any other shape the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly\r\nsince my escape i have had several conversations on this subject with\r\nan old schoolmaster of the district and it was from him that i\r\nlearned the use of the words cylinder and sphere he explained to\r\nmealthough i have forgotten the explanationhow what i observed\r\nwas in fact the natural consequence of the forms of the floating\r\nfragments and showed me how it happened that a cylinder swimming in\r\na vortex offered more resistance to its suction and was drawn in\r\nwith greater difficulty than an equally bulky body of any form\r\nwhatever\r\n\r\nfootnote  see archimedes de iis ques in humido vehuntur lib\r\nii\r\n\r\nthere was one startling circumstance which went a great way in\r\nenforcing these observations and rendering me anxious to turn them to\r\naccount and this was that at every revolution we passed something\r\nlike a barrel or else the yard or the mast of a vessel while many of\r\nthese things which had been on our level when i first opened my eyes\r\nupon the wonders of the whirlpool were now high up above us and\r\nseemed to have moved but little from their original station\r\n\r\ni no longer hesitated what to do i resolved to lash myself securely\r\nto the water cask upon which i now held to cut it loose from the\r\ncounter and to throw myself with it into the water i attracted my\r\nbrothers attention by signs pointed to the floating barrels that\r\ncame near us and did everything in my power to make him understand\r\nwhat i was about to do i thought at length that he comprehended my\r\ndesignbut whether this was the case or not he shook his head\r\ndespairingly and refused to move from his station by the ringbolt\r\nit was impossible to reach him the emergency admitted of no delay\r\nand so with a bitter struggle i resigned him to his fate fastened\r\nmyself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the\r\ncounter and precipitated myself with it into the sea without another\r\nmoments hesitation\r\n\r\nthe result was precisely what i had hoped it might be  as it is\r\nmyself who now tell you this taleas you see that i did escapeand\r\nas you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was\r\neffected and must therefore anticipate all that i have farther to\r\nsayi will bring my story quickly to conclusion it might have been\r\nan hour or thereabout after my quitting the smack when having\r\ndescended to a vast distance beneath me it made three or four wild\r\ngyrations in rapid succession and bearing my loved brother with it\r\nplunged headlong at once and forever into the chaos of foam\r\nbelow the barrel to which i was attached sunk very little farther\r\nthan half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at\r\nwhich i leaped overboard before a great change took place in the\r\ncharacter of the whirlpool the slope of the sides of the vast funnel\r\nbecame momently less and less steep  the gyrations of the whirl grew\r\ngradually less and less violent  by degrees the froth and the\r\nrainbow disappeared and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to\r\nuprise the sky was clear the winds had gone down and the full moon\r\nwas setting radiantly in the west when i found myself on the surface\r\nof the ocean in full view of the shores of lofoden and above the\r\nspot where the pool of the moskoeström had been it was the  hour\r\nof the slack but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the\r\neffects of the hurricane i was borne violently into the channel of\r\nthe ström and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the\r\ngrounds of the fishermen a boat picked me upexhausted from\r\nfatigueand now that the danger was removed speechless from the\r\nmemory of its horror  those who drew me on board were my old mates\r\nand daily companions but they knew me no more than they would have\r\nknown a traveller from the spiritland my hair which had been\r\nravenblack the day before was as white as you see it now  they say\r\ntoo that the whole expression of my countenance had changed i told\r\nthem my storythey did not believe it i now tell it to youand i\r\ncan scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry\r\nfishermen of lofoden\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe masque of the red death\r\n\r\n\r\nnorthern italy\r\n\r\nthe red death had long devastated the country no pestilence had\r\never been so fatal or so hideous blood was its avatar and its\r\nsealthe redness and the horror of blood  there were sharp pains\r\nand sudden dizziness and then profuse bleeding at the pores with\r\ndissolution the scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the\r\nface of the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid\r\nand from the sympathy of his fellowmen and the whole seizure\r\nprogress and termination of the disease were the incidents of half an\r\nhour\r\n\r\nbut the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious when\r\nhis dominions were half depopulated he summoned to his presence a\r\nthousand hale and lighthearted friends from among the knights and\r\ndames of his court and with these retired to the deep seclusion of\r\none of his castellated abbeys this was an extensive and magnificent\r\nstructure the creation of the princes own eccentric yet august\r\ntaste a strong and lofty wall girdled it in this wall had gates of\r\niron the courtiers having entered brought furnaces and massy\r\nhammers and welded the bolts they resolved to leave means neither of\r\ningress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from\r\nwithin the abbey was amply provisioned  with such precautions the\r\ncourtiers might bid defiance to contagion the external world could\r\ntake care of itself in the meantime it was folly to grieve or to\r\nthink the prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure there\r\nwere buffoons there were improvisatori there were balletdancers\r\nthere were musicians there was beauty there was wine all these and\r\nsecurity were within without was the red death\r\n\r\nit was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion\r\nand while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad that the prince\r\nprospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most\r\nunusual magnificence\r\n\r\nit was a voluptuous scene that masquerade but first let me tell of\r\nthe rooms in which it was held there were sevenan imperial\r\nsuite in many palaces however such suites form a long and straight\r\nvista while the foldingdoors slide back nearly to the walls on\r\neither hand so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely\r\nimpeded here the case was very different as might have been expected\r\nfrom the princes love of the bizarre the apartments were so\r\nirregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one\r\nat a time  there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards\r\nand at each turn a novel effect to the right and left in the middle\r\nof each wall a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed\r\ncorridor which pursued the windings of the suite these windows were\r\nof stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing\r\nhue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened that at\r\nthe eastern extremity was hung for example in blueand vividly blue\r\nwere its windows the second chamber was purple in its ornaments and\r\ntapestries and here the panes were purple the third was green\r\nthroughout and so were the casements the fourth was furnished and\r\nlighted with orange the fifth with white the sixth with violet the\r\nseventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that\r\nhung all over the ceiling and down the walls falling in heavy folds\r\nupon a carpet of the same material and hue but in this chamber only\r\nthe color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations\r\nthe panes here were scarleta deep bloodcolor now in no one of the\r\nseven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum amid the profusion\r\nof golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the\r\nroof there was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle\r\nwithin the suite of chambers but in the corridors that followed the\r\nsuite there stood opposite to each window a heavy tripod bearing a\r\nbrazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and\r\nso glaringly illumined the room and thus were produced a multitude of\r\ngaudy and fantastic appearances but in the western or black chamber\r\nthe effect of the firelight that streamed upon the dark hangings\r\nthrough the bloodtinted panes was ghastly in the extreme and\r\nproduced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered\r\nthat there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its\r\nprecincts at all\r\n\r\nit was in this apartment also that there stood against the western\r\nwall a gigantic clock of ebony its pendulum swung to and fro with a\r\ndull heavy monotonous clang and when the minutehand made the\r\ncircuit of the face and the hour was to be stricken there came from\r\nthe brazen lungs of the clock a sounct which was clear and loud and\r\ndeep and exceedingly musical but of so peculiars note and emphasis\r\nthat at each lapse of an hour the musicians of the orchestra were\r\nconstrained to pause momentarily in their performance to hearken to\r\nthe sound and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions and\r\nthere was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company and while the\r\nchimes of the clock yet rang it was observed that the giddiest grew\r\npale and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows\r\nas if in confused revery or meditation but when the echoes had fully\r\nceased a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly the musicians\r\nlooked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and\r\nfolly and made whispering vows each to the other that the next\r\nchiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion and\r\nthen after the lapse of sixty minutes which embrace three thousand\r\nand six hundred seconds of the time that flies there came yet another\r\nchiming of the clock and then were the same disconcert and\r\ntremulousness and meditation as before\r\n\r\nbut in spite of these things it was a gay and magnificent revel the\r\ntastes of the prince were peculiar he had a fine eye for colors and\r\neffects he disregarded the decora of mere fashion his plans were\r\nbold and fiery and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre there\r\nare some who would have thought him mad his followers felt that he\r\nwas not it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure\r\nthat he was not\r\n\r\nhe had directed in great part the movable embellishments of the\r\nseven chambers upon occasion of this great fête and it was his own\r\nguiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders be sure\r\nthey were grotesque there were much glare and glitter and piquancy\r\nand phantasmmuch of what has been since seen in hernani there\r\nwere arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments there\r\nwere delirious fancies such as the madman fashions there was much of\r\nthe beautiful much of the wanton much of the bizarre something of\r\nthe terrible and not a little of that which might have excited\r\ndisgust to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked in fact a\r\nmultitude of dreams and thesethe dreamswrithed in and about\r\ntaking hue from the rooms and causing the wild music of the orchestra\r\nto seem as the echo of their steps and anon there strikes the ebony\r\nclock which stands in the hall of the velvet and then for a moment\r\nall is still and all is silent save the voice of the clock the\r\ndreams are stifffrozen as they stand but the echoes of the chime die\r\nawaythey have endured but an instantand a light halfsubdued\r\nlaughter floats after them as they depart and now again the music\r\nswells and the dreams live and writhe to and fro more merrily than\r\never taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the\r\nrays from the tripods but to the chamber which lies most westwardly\r\nof the seven there are now none of the maskers who venture for the\r\nnight is waning away and there flows a ruddier light through the\r\nbloodcolored panes and the blackness of the sable drapery appalls\r\nand to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet there comes from\r\nthe near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any\r\nwhich reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gayeties of\r\nthe other apartments\r\n\r\nbut these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beat\r\nfeverishly the heart of life and the revel went whirlingly on until\r\nat length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock and\r\nthen the music ceased as i have told and the evolutions of the\r\nwaltzers were quieted and there was an uneasy cessation of all things\r\nas before but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell\r\nof the clock and thus it happened perhaps that more of thought\r\ncrept with more of time into the meditations of the thoughtful among\r\nthose who revelled and thus too it happened perhaps that before the\r\nlast echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there\r\nwere many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become\r\naware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the\r\nattention of no single individual before and the rumor of this new\r\npresence having spread itself whisperingly around there arose at\r\nlength from the whole company a buzz or murmur expressive of\r\ndisapprobation and surprisethen finally of terror of horror and\r\nof disgust\r\n\r\nin an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted it may well be\r\nsupposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such\r\nsensation in truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly\r\nunlimited but the figure in question had outheroded herod and gone\r\nbeyond the bounds of even the princes indefinite decorum there are\r\nchords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched\r\nwithout emotion  even with the utterly lost to whom life and death\r\nare equally jests there are matters of which no jest can be made the\r\nwhole company indeed seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume\r\nand bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed the\r\nfigure was tall and gaunt and shrouded from head to foot in the\r\nhabiliments of the grave the mask which concealed the visage was made\r\nso nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the\r\nclosest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat and\r\nyet all this might have been endured if not approved by the mad\r\nrevellers around but the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type\r\nof the red death his vesture was dabbled in bloodand his broad\r\nbrow with all the features of the face was besprinkled with the\r\nscarlet horror\r\n\r\nwhen the eyes of prince prospero fell upon this spectral image which\r\nwith a slow and solemn movement as if more fully to sustain its\r\nrole stalked to and fro among the waltzers he was seen to be\r\nconvulsed in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror\r\nor distaste but in the next his brow reddened with rage\r\n\r\nwho dares he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near\r\nhimwho dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery seize him and\r\nunmask himthat we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise from the\r\nbattlements\r\n\r\nit was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince\r\nprospero as he uttered these words they rang throughout the seven\r\nrooms loudly and clearlyfor the prince was a bold and robust man\r\nand the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand\r\n\r\nit was in the blue room where stood the prince with a group of pale\r\ncourtiers by his side at first as he spoke there was a slight\r\nrushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder who\r\nat the moment was also near at hand and now with deliberate and\r\nstately step made closer approach to the speaker but from a certain\r\nnameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired\r\nthe whole party there were found none who put forth hand to seize\r\nhim so that unimpeded he passed within a yard of the princes\r\nperson and while the vast assembly as if with one impulse shrank\r\nfrom the centres of the rooms to the walls he made his way\r\nuninterruptedly but with the same solemn and measured step which had\r\ndistinguished him from the first through the blue chamber to the\r\npurplethrough the purple to the greenthrough the green to the\r\norangethrough this again to the whiteand even thence to the\r\nviolet ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him it was\r\nthen however that the prince prospero maddening with rage and the\r\nshame of his own momentary cowardice rushed hurriedly through the six\r\nchambers while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that\r\nhad seized upon all he bore aloft a drawn dagger and had approached\r\nin rapid impetuosity to within three or four feet of the retreating\r\nfigure when the latter having attained the extremity of the velvet\r\napartment turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer there was a\r\nsharp cryand the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet\r\nupon which instantly afterwards fell prostrate in death the prince\r\nprospero then summoning the wild courage of despair a throng of the\r\nrevellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment and\r\nseizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect and motionless\r\nwithin the shadow of the ebony clock gasped in unutterable horror at\r\nfinding the grave cerements and corpselike mask which they handled\r\nwith so violent a rudeness untenanted by any tangible form\r\n\r\nand now was acknowledged the presence of the red death  he had come\r\nlike a thief in the night and one by one dropped the revellers in the\r\nbloodbedewed halls of their revel and died each in the despairing\r\nposture of his fall and the life of the ebony clock went out with\r\nthat of the last of the gay and the flames of the tripods expired\r\nand darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion\r\nover all\r\n\r\n\r\nthe gold bug\r\n\r\n  what ho what ho this fellow is dancing mad\r\n  he hath been bitten by the tarantula\r\n                               all in the wrong\r\n\r\n\r\nmany years ago i contracted an intimacy with a mr  william legrand\r\nhe was of an ancient huguenot family and had once been wealthy but a\r\nseries of misfortunes had reduced him to want  to avoid the\r\nmortification consequent upon his disasters he left new orleans the\r\ncity of his forefathers and took up his residence at sullivans\r\nisland near charleston south carolina\r\n\r\nthis island is a very singular one  it consists of little else than\r\nthe sea sand and is about three miles long  its breadth at no point\r\nexceeds a quarter of a mile it is separated from the mainland by a\r\nscarcely perceptible creek oozing its way through a wilderness of\r\nreeds and slime a favorite resort of the marshhen the vegetation\r\nas might be supposed is scant or at least dwarfish no trees of any\r\nmagnitude are to be seen near the western extremity where fort\r\nmoultrie stands and where are some miserable frame buildings\r\ntenanted during summer by the fugitives from charleston dust and\r\nfever may be found indeed the bristly palmetto but the whole\r\nisland with the exception of this western point and a line of hard\r\nwhite beach on the seacoast is covered with a dense undergrowth of\r\nthe sweet myrtle so much prized by the horticulturists of england\r\nthe shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet and\r\nforms an almost impenetrable coppice burdening the air with its\r\nfragrance\r\n\r\nin the utmost recesses of this coppice not far from the eastern or\r\nmore remote end of the island legrand had built himself a small hut\r\nwhich he occupied when i first by mere accident made his\r\nacquaintance this soon ripened into friendshipfor there was much\r\nin the recluse to excite interest and esteem i found him well\r\neducated with unusual powers of mind but infected with misanthropy\r\nand subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy\r\nhe had with him many books but rarely employed them  his chief\r\namusements were gunning and fishing or sauntering along the beach and\r\nthrough the myrtles in quest of shells or entomological\r\nspecimenshis collection of the latter might have been envied by a\r\nswammerdamm in these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old\r\nnegro called jupiter who had been manumitted before the reverses of\r\nthe family but who could be induced neither by threats nor by\r\npromises to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon\r\nthe footsteps of his young massa will it is not improbable that the\r\nrelatives of legrand conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in\r\nintellect had contrived to instil this obstinacy into jupiter with a\r\nview to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer\r\n\r\nthe winters in the latitude of sullivans island are seldom very\r\nsevere and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a\r\nfire is considered necessary about the middle of october  there\r\noccurred however a day of remarkable chilliness just before sunset\r\ni scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend\r\nwhom i had not visited for several weeksmy residence being at that\r\ntime in charleston a distance of nine miles from the island while\r\nthe facilities of passage and repassage were very far behind those of\r\nthe present day upon reaching the hut i rapped as was my custom\r\nand getting no reply sought for the key where i knew it was\r\nsecreted unlocked the door and went in a fine fire was blazing upon\r\nthe hearth it was a novelty and by no means an ungrateful one i\r\nthrew off an overcoat took an armchair by the crackling logs and\r\nawaited patiently the arrival of my hosts\r\n\r\nsoon after dark they arrived and gave me a most cordial\r\nwelcome jupiter grinning from ear to ear bustled about to prepare\r\nsome marshhens for supper legrand was in one of his fitshow else\r\nshall i term themof enthusiasm he had found an unknown bivalve\r\nforming a new genus and more than this he had hunted down and\r\nsecured with jupiters assistance a scarabæus which he believed to\r\nbe totally new but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion\r\non the morrow\r\n\r\nand why not tonight i asked rubbing my hands over the blaze and\r\nwishing the whole tribe of scarabæi at the devil\r\n\r\nah if i had only known you were here said legrand but its so\r\nlong since i saw you and how could i foresee that you would pay me a\r\nvisit this very night of all others  as i was coming home i met\r\nlieutenant g from the fort and very foolishly i lent him the\r\nbug so it will be impossible for you to see it until the\r\nmorning stay here tonight and i will send jup down for it at\r\nsunrise it is the loveliest thing in creation\r\n\r\nwhatsunrise\r\n\r\nnonsense nothe bug it is of a brilliant gold colorabout the\r\nsize of a large hickorynutwith two jet black spots near one\r\nextremity of the back and another somewhat longer at the other the\r\nantennæ are\r\n\r\ndey aint no tin in him massa will i keep a tellin on you here\r\ninterrupted jupiter de bug is a goolebug solid ebery bit of him\r\ninside and all sep him wingneberfeel half so hebby a bug in my\r\nlife\r\n\r\nwell suppose it is jup replied legrand somewhat more earnestly\r\nit seemed to me than the case demanded is that any reason for your\r\nletting the birds burn the colorhere he turned to meis really\r\nalmost enough to warrant jupiters idea you never saw a more\r\nbrilliant metallic lustre than the scales emitbut of this you cannot\r\njudge till tomorrow in the meantime i can give you some idea of the\r\nshape saying this he seated himself at a small table on which were\r\na pen and ink but no paper he looked for some in a drawer but found\r\nnone\r\n\r\nnever mind said he at length this will answer and he drew from\r\nhis waistcoat pocket a scrap of what i took to be very dirty foolscap\r\nand made upon it a rough drawing with the pen  while he did this i\r\nretained my seat by the fire for i was still chilly  when the design\r\nwas complete he handed it to me without rising  as i received it a\r\nlow growl was heard succeeded by a scratching at the door jupiter\r\nopened it and a large newfoundland belonging to legrand rushed in\r\nleaped upon my shoulders and loaded me with caresses for i had shown\r\nhim much attention during previous visits  when his gambols were\r\nover i looked at the paper and to speak the truth found myself not\r\na little puzzled at what my friend had depicted\r\n\r\nwell i said after contemplating it for some minutes this is a\r\nstrange scarabæus i must confess new to me never saw anything\r\nlike it beforeunless it was a skull or a deathshead which it\r\nmore nearly resembles than anything else that has come under my\r\nobservation\r\n\r\na deathshead  echoed legrandohyeswell it has something of\r\nthat appearance upon paper no doubt  the two upper black spots look\r\nlike eyes eh and the longer one at the bottom like a mouthand then\r\nthe shape of the whole is oval\r\n\r\nperhaps so said i but legrand i fear you are no artist i must\r\nwait until i see the beetle itself if i am to form any idea of its\r\npersonal appearance\r\n\r\nwell i dont know said he a little nettled i draw\r\ntolerablyshould do it at leasthave had good masters and flatter\r\nmyself that i am not quite a blockhead\r\n\r\nbut my dear fellow you are joking then said i this is a very\r\npassable skullindeed i may say that it is a very excellent\r\nskull according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of\r\nphysiologyand your scarabæus must be the queerest scarabæus\r\nin the world if it resembles it why we may get up a very thrilling\r\nbit of superstition upon this hint  i presume you will call the bug\r\nscarabæus caput hominis or something of that kindthere are\r\nmany similar titles in the natural histories  but where are the\r\nantennae you spoke of  the antennae said legrand who seemed\r\nto be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject i am sure you must\r\nsee the antennae i made them as distinct as they are in the\r\noriginal insect and i presume that is sufficient\r\n\r\nwell well i said perhaps you havestill i dont see them and\r\ni handed him the paper without additional remark not wishing to\r\nruffle his temper but i was much surprised at the turn affairs had\r\ntaken his ill humor puzzled meand as for the drawing of the\r\nbeetle there were positively no antennae visible and the whole\r\ndid bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a\r\ndeathshead\r\n\r\nhe received the paper very peevishly and was about to crumple it\r\napparently to throw it in the fire when a casual glance at the design\r\nseemed suddenly to rivet his attention  in an instant his face grew\r\nviolently redin another as excessively pale  for some minutes he\r\ncontinued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat  at length\r\nhe arose took a candle from the table and proceeded to seat himself\r\nupon a seachest in the farthest corner of the room here again he\r\nmade an anxious examination of the paper turning it in all\r\ndirections he said nothing however and his conduct greatly\r\nastonished me yet i thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing\r\nmoodiness of his temper by any comment presently he took from his\r\ncoat pocket a wallet placed the paper carefully in it and deposited\r\nboth in a writingdesk which he locked he now grew more composed in\r\nhis demeanor but his original air of enthusiasm had quite\r\ndisappeared yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted  as the\r\nevening wore away he became more and more absorbed in revery from\r\nwhich no sallies of mine could arouse him it had been my intention to\r\npass the night at the hut as i had frequently done before but\r\nseeing my host in this mood i deemed it proper to take leave he did\r\nnot press me to remain but as i departed he shook my hand with even\r\nmore than his usual cordiality\r\n\r\nit was about a month after this and during the interval i had seen\r\nnothing of legrand when i received a visit at charleston from his\r\nman jupiter i had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited\r\nand i feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend\r\n\r\nwell jup said i what is the matter nowhow is your master\r\n\r\nwhy to speak de troof massa him not so berry well as mought be\r\n\r\nnot well i am truly sorry to hear it what does he

of a visit from you today\r\n\r\nwhat de matter massa\r\n\r\ndid you bring any message from mr legrand\r\n\r\nno massa i bring dis here pissel and here jupiter handed me a\r\nnote which ran thus\r\n\r\n\r\nmy dear  why have i not seen you for so long a time  i hope you\r\nhave not been so foolish as to take offence at any little brusquerie\r\nof mine but no that is improbable\r\n\r\nsince i saw you i have had great cause for anxiety i have something\r\nto tell you yet scarcely know how to tell it or whether i should\r\ntell it at all\r\n\r\ni have not been quite well for some days past and poor old jup\r\nannoys me almost beyond endurance by his wellmeant attentions\r\nwould you believe ithe had prepared a huge stick the other day\r\nwith which to chastise me for giving him the slip and spending the\r\nday solus among the hills on the mainland i verily believe that\r\nmy ill looks alone saved me a flogging\r\n\r\ni have made no addition to my cabinet since we met\r\n\r\nif you can in any way make it convenient come over with jupiter\r\ndo come i wish to see you tonight upon business of importance\r\ni assure you that it is of the highest importance\r\n\r\never yours\r\nwilliam legrand\r\n\r\n\r\nthere was something in the tone of this note which gave me great\r\nuneasiness its whole style differed materially from that of legrand\r\nwhat could he be dreaming of what new crotchet possessed his\r\nexcitable brain what business of the highest importance could he\r\npossibly have to transact  jupiters account of him boded no good i\r\ndreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had at length\r\nfairly unsettled the reason of my friend without a moments\r\nhesitation therefore i prepared to accompany the negro\r\n\r\nupon reaching the wharf i noticed a scythe and three spades all\r\napparently new lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to\r\nembark\r\n\r\nwhat is the meaning of all this jup i inquired\r\n\r\nhim syfe massa and spade\r\n\r\nvery true but what are they doing here\r\n\r\nhim de syfe and de spade what massa will sis pon my buying for him in\r\nde town and de debbils own lot of money i had to gib for em\r\n\r\nbut what in the name of all that is mysterious is your massa will\r\ngoing to do with scythes and spades\r\n\r\ndats more dan i know and debbil take me if i dont blieve tis\r\nmore dan he know too but its all cum ob de bug\r\n\r\nfinding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of jupiter whose\r\nwhole intellect seemed to be absorbed by de bug i now stepped into\r\nthe boat and made sail with a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into\r\nthe little cove to the northward of fort moultrie and a walk of some\r\ntwo miles brought us to the hut it was about three in the afternoon\r\nwhen we arrived  legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation\r\nhe grasped my hand with a nervous empressement which alarmed me and\r\nstrengthened the suspicions already entertained his countenance was\r\npale even to ghastliness and his deepset eyes glared with unnatural\r\nlustre after some inquiries respecting his health i asked him not\r\nknowing what better to say if he had yet obtained the scarabæus\r\nfrom lieutenant g\r\n\r\noh yes he replied coloring violently i got it from him the next\r\nmorning  nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabæus do\r\nyou know that jupiter is quite right about it\r\n\r\nin what way i asked with a sad foreboding at heart\r\n\r\nin supposing it to be a bug of real gold he said this with an air\r\nof profound seriousness and i felt inexpressibly shocked\r\n\r\nthis bug is to make my fortune he continued with a triumphant\r\nsmile to reinstate me in my family possessions  is it any wonder\r\nthen that i prize it since fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon\r\nme i have only to use it properly and i shall arrive at the gold of\r\nwhich it is the index jupiter bring me that scarabæus\r\n\r\nwhat de bug massa id rudder not go fer trubble dat bugyou mus\r\ngit him for your own self hereupon legrand arose with a grave and\r\nstately air and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it\r\nwas enclosed it was a beautiful scarabæus and at that time\r\nunknown to naturalistsof course a great prize in a scientific point\r\nof view there were two round black spots near one extremity of the\r\nback and a long one near the other the scales were exceedingly hard\r\nand glossy with all the appearance of burnished gold the weight of\r\nthe insect was very remarkable and taking all things into\r\nconsideration i could hardly blame jupiter for his opinion respecting\r\nit but what to make of legrands agreement with that opinion i could\r\nnot for the life of me tell\r\n\r\ni sent for you said he in a grandiloquent tone when i had\r\ncompleted my examination of the beetle i sent for you that i might\r\nhave your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of fate and\r\nof the bug\r\n\r\nmy dear legrand i cried interrupting him you are certainly\r\nunwell and had better use some little precautions  you shall go to\r\nbed and i will remain with you a few days until you get over\r\nthis you are feverish and\r\n\r\nfeel my pulse said he\r\n\r\ni felt it and to say the truth found not the slightest indication\r\nof fever\r\n\r\nbut you may be ill and yet have no fever allow me this once to\r\nprescribe for you in the first place go to bed in the next\r\n\r\nyou are mistaken he interposed i am as well as i can expect to be\r\nunder the excitement which i suffer if you really wish me well you\r\nwill relieve this excitement\r\n\r\nand how is this to be done\r\n\r\nvery easily jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the\r\nhills upon the mainland and in this expedition we shall need the\r\naid of some person in whom we can confide you are the only one we can\r\ntrust whether we succeed or fail the excitement which you now\r\nperceive in me will be equally allayed\r\n\r\ni am anxious to oblige you in any way i replied but do you mean\r\nto say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your\r\nexpedition into the hills\r\n\r\nit has\r\n\r\nthen legrand i can become a party to no such absurd proceeding\r\n\r\ni am sorryvery sorryfor we shall have to try it by ourselves\r\n\r\ntry it by yourselves the man is surely madbut stayhow long do\r\nyou propose to be absent\r\n\r\nprobably all night we shall start immediately and be back at all\r\nevents by sunrise\r\n\r\nand will you promise me upon your honor that when this freak of\r\nyours is over and the bug business good god  settled to your\r\nsatisfaction you will then return home and follow my advice\r\nimplicitly as that of your physician\r\n\r\nyes i promise and now let us be off for we have no time to lose\r\n\r\nwith a heavy heart i accompanied my friend we started about four\r\noclocklegrand jupiter the dog and myself  jupiter had with him\r\nthe scythe and spadesthe whole of which he insisted upon carrying\r\nmore through fear it seemed to me of trusting either of the\r\nimplements within reach of his master than from any excess of\r\nindustry or complaisance his demeanor was dogged in the extreme and\r\ndat dd bug were the sole words which escaped his lips during the\r\njourney for my own part i had charge of a couple of dark lanterns\r\nwhile legrand contented himself with the scarabæus which he\r\ncarried attached to the end of a bit of whipcord twirling it to and\r\nfro with the air of a conjurer as he went when i observed this\r\nlast plain evidence of my friends aberation of mind i could\r\nscarcely refrain from tears i thought it best however to humor his\r\nfancy at least for the present or until i could adopt some more\r\nenergetic measures with a chance of success in the meantime i\r\nendeavored but all in vain to sound him in regard to the object of\r\nthe expedition  having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him he\r\nseemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor\r\nimportance and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than we\r\nshall see\r\n\r\nwe crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff\r\nand ascending the high grounds on the shore of the mainland\r\nproceeded in a northwesterly direction through a tract of country\r\nexcessively wild and desolate where no trace of a human footstep was\r\nto be seen legrand led the way with decision pausing only for an\r\ninstant here and there to consult what appeared to be certain\r\nlandmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion\r\n\r\nin this manner we journeyed for about two hours and the sun was just\r\nsetting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet\r\nseen it was a species of tableland near the summit of an almost\r\ninaccessible hill densely wooded from base to pinnacle and\r\ninterspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the\r\nsoil and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves\r\ninto the valleys below merely by the support of the trees against\r\nwhich they reclined  deep ravines in various directions gave an air\r\nof still sterner solemnity to the scene\r\n\r\nthe natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown\r\nwith brambles through which we soon discovered that it would have\r\nbeen impossible to force our way but for the scythe and jupiter by\r\ndirection of his master proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot\r\nof an enormously tall tulip tree which stood with some eight or ten\r\noaks upon the level and far surpassed them all and all other trees\r\nwhich i had then ever seen in the beauty of its foliage and form in\r\nthe wide spread of its branches and in the general majesty of its\r\nappearance when we reached this tree legrand turned to jupiter and\r\nasked him if he thought he could climb it the old man seemed a little\r\nstaggered by the question and for some moments made no reply at\r\nlength he approached the huge trunk walked slowly around it and\r\nexamined it with minute attention when he had completed his scrutiny\r\nhe merely said\r\n\r\nyes massa jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life\r\n\r\nthen up with you as soon as possible for it will soon be too dark to\r\nsee what we are about\r\n\r\nhow far mus go up massa inquired jupiter\r\n\r\nget up the main trunk first and then i will tell you which way to\r\ngoand herestop take this beetle with you\r\n\r\nde bug massa willde goolebug cried the negro drawing back in\r\ndismaywhat for mus tote de bug way up de treedn if i do\r\n\r\nif you are afraid jup a great big negro like you to take hold of a\r\nharmless little dead beetle why you can carry it up by this\r\nstringbut if you do not take it up with you in some way i shall be\r\nunder the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel\r\n\r\nwhat de matter now massa said jup evidently shamed into\r\ncompliance always want fur to raise fuss wid old nigger  was only\r\nfunnin anyhow me feered de bug what i keer for de bug here he\r\ntook cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string and\r\nmaintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would\r\npermit prepared to ascend the tree\r\n\r\nin youth the tulip tree or liriodendron tulipifera the most\r\nmagnificent of american foresters has a trunk peculiarly smooth and\r\noften rises to a great height without lateral branches but in its\r\nriper age the bark becomes gnarled and uneven while many short limbs\r\nmake their appearance on the stem thus the difficulty of ascension\r\nin the present case lay more in semblance than in reality embracing\r\nthe huge cylinder as closely as possible with his arms and knees\r\nseizing with his hands some projections and resting his naked toes\r\nupon others jupiter after one or two narrow escapes from falling at\r\nlength wriggled himself into the first great fork and seemed to\r\nconsider the whole business as virtually accomplished the risk of\r\nthe achievement was in fact now over although the climber was some\r\nsixty or seventy feet from the ground\r\n\r\nwhich way mus go now massa will he asked\r\n\r\nkeep up the largest branchthe one on this side said legrand the\r\nnegro obeyed him promptly and apparently with but little trouble\r\nascending higher and higher until no glimpse of his squat figure\r\ncould be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it\r\npresently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo\r\n\r\nhow much fudder is got for go\r\n\r\nhow high up are you asked legrand\r\n\r\nebber so fur replied the negro can see de sky fru de top ob de\r\ntree\r\n\r\nnever mind

dis\r\nside\r\n\r\nthen go one limb higher\r\n\r\nin a few minutes the voice was heard again announcing that the\r\nseventh limb was attained\r\n\r\nnow jup cried legrand evidently much excited i want you to work\r\nyour way out upon that limb as far as you can if you see anything\r\nstrange let me know\r\n\r\nby this time what little doubt i might have entertained of my poor\r\nfriends insanity was put finally at rest i had no alternative but to\r\nconclude him stricken with lunacy and i became seriously anxious\r\nabout getting him home while i was pondering upon what was best to be\r\ndone jupiters voice was again heard\r\n\r\nmos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry fartis dead limb putty\r\nmuch all de way\r\n\r\ndid you say it was a dead limb jupiter cried legrand in a\r\nquavering voice\r\n\r\nyes massa him dead as de doornaildone up for sartaindone\r\ndeparted dis here life\r\n\r\nwhat in the name of heaven shall i do asked legrand seemingly in\r\nthe greatest

of\r\nthe skull or the place where the left eye has been have you found\r\nit\r\n\r\nhere was a long pause at length the negro asked is de lef eye of de\r\nskull pon de same side as de lef hand of de

reachbut\r\nbe careful and not let go your hold of the string\r\n\r\nall dat done massa will mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de\r\nholelook out for him dar below\r\n\r\nduring this colloquy no portion of jupiters person could be seen but\r\nthe beetle which he had suffered to descend was now visible at the\r\nend of the string and glistened like a globe of burnished gold in the\r\nlast rays of the setting sun some of which still faintly illumined\r\nthe eminence upon which we stood the scarabæus hung quite clear of\r\nany branches and if allowed to fall would have fallen at our\r\nfeet legrand immediately took the scythe and cleared with it a\r\ncircular space three or four yards in diameter just beneath the\r\ninsect and having accomplished this ordered jupiter to let go the\r\nstring and come down from the tree\r\n\r\ndriving a peg with great nicety into the ground at the precise spot\r\nwhere the beetle fell my friend now produced from his pocket a\r\ntapemeasure fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk of\r\nthe tree which was nearest the peg he unrolled it till it reached the\r\npeg and thence farther unrolled it in the direction already\r\nestablished by the two points of the tree and the peg for the\r\ndistance of fifty feetjupiter clearing away the brambles with the\r\nscythe at the spot thus attained a second peg was driven and about\r\nthis as a centre a rude circle about four feet in diameter\r\ndescribed taking now a spade himself and giving one to jupiter and\r\none to me legrand begged us to set about digging as quickly as\r\npossible\r\n\r\nto speak the truth i had no especial relish for such amusement at any\r\ntime and at that particular moment would most willingly have\r\ndeclined it for the night was coming on and i felt much fatigued\r\nwith the exercise already taken but i saw no mode of escape and was\r\nfearful of disturbing my poor friends equanimity by a refusal could\r\ni have depended indeed upon jupiters aid i would have had no\r\nhesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force but i was\r\ntoo well assured of the old negros disposition to hope that he would\r\nassist me under any circumstances in a personal contest with his\r\nmaster i made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of\r\nthe innumerable southern superstitions about money buried and that\r\nhis fantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the\r\nscarabæus or perhaps by jupiters obstinacy in maintaining it to\r\nbe a bug of real gold  a mind disposed to lunacy would readily be\r\nled away by such suggestions especially if chiming in with favorite\r\npreconceived ideas and then i called to mind the poor fellows speech\r\nabout the beetles being the index of his fortune upon the whole i\r\nwas sadly vexed and puzzled but at length i concluded to make a\r\nvirtue of necessityto dig with a good will and thus the sooner to\r\nconvince the visionary by ocular demonstration of the fallacy of the\r\nopinions he entertained\r\n\r\nthe lanterns having been lit we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a\r\nmore rational cause and as the glare fell upon our persons and\r\nimplements i could not help thinking how picturesque a group we\r\ncomposed and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared\r\nto any interloper who by chance might have stumbled upon our\r\nwhereabouts\r\n\r\nwe dug very steadily for two hours little was said and our chief\r\nembarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog who took exceeding\r\ninterest in our proceedings he at length became so obstreperous\r\nthat we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the\r\nvicinity or rather this was the apprehension of legrand for\r\nmyself i should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have\r\nenabled me to get the wanderer home the noise was at length very\r\neffectually silenced by jupiter who getting out of the hole with a\r\ndogged air of deliberation tied the brutes mouth up with one of his\r\nsuspenders and then returned with a grave chuckle to his task\r\n\r\nwhen the time mentioned had expired we had reached a depth of five\r\nfeet and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest a general\r\npause ensued and i began to hope that the farce was at an end\r\nlegrand however although evidently much disconcerted wiped his brow\r\nthoughtfully and recommenced we had excavated the entire circle of\r\nfour feet diameter and now we slightly enlarged the limit and went\r\nto the farther depth of two feet still nothing appeared the\r\ngoldseeker whom i sincerely pitied at length clambered from the\r\npit with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature\r\nand proceeded slowly and reluctantly to put on his coat which he\r\nhad thrown off at the beginning of his labor in the meantime i made\r\nno remark jupiter at a signal from his master began to gather up\r\nhis tools this done and the dog having been unmuzzled we turned in\r\nprofound silence towards home\r\n\r\nwe had taken perhaps a dozen steps in this direction when with a\r\nloud oath legrand strode up to jupiter and seized him by the collar\r\nthe astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent\r\nlet fall the spades and fell upon his knees\r\n\r\nyou scoundrel said legrand hissing out the syllables from between\r\nhis clenched teethyou infernal black villainspeak i tell\r\nyouanswer me this instant without prevaricationwhichwhich is\r\nyour left eye\r\n\r\noh my golly massa will aint dis here my lef eye for sartain\r\nroared the terrified jupiter placing his hand upon his right organ\r\nof vision and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity as if in\r\nimmediate dread of his masters attempt at a gouge\r\n\r\ni thought so i knew it hurrah vociferated legrand letting the\r\nnegro go and executing a series of curvets and caracoles much to the\r\nastonishment of his valet who arising from his knees looked mutely\r\nfrom his master to myself and then from myself to his master\r\n\r\ncome we must go back said the latter the games not up yet and\r\nhe again led the way to the tulip tree\r\n\r\njupiter said he when we reached its foot come here  was the\r\nskull nailed to the limb with the face outward or with the face to\r\nthe limb\r\n\r\nde face was out massa so dat de crows could get at de eyes good\r\nwidout any trouble\r\n\r\nwell then was it this eye or that through which you dropped the\r\nbeetle here legrand touched each of jupiters eyes\r\n\r\ntwas dis eye massade lef eyejis as you tell me and here it\r\nwas his right eye that the negro indicated\r\n\r\nthat will dowe must try it again\r\n\r\nhere my friend about whose madness i now saw or fancied that i saw\r\ncertain indications of method removed the peg which marked the spot\r\nwhere the beetle fell to a spot about three inches to the westward of\r\nits former position taking now the tapemeasure from the nearest\r\npoint of the trunk to the peg as before and continuing the extension\r\nin a straight line to the distance of fifty feet a spot was\r\nindicated removed by several yards from the point at which we had\r\nbeen digging\r\n\r\naround the new position a circle somewhat larger than in the former\r\ninstance was now described and we again set to work with the spades\r\ni was dreadfully weary but scarcely understanding what had\r\noccasioned the change in my thoughts i felt no longer any great\r\naversion from the labor imposed i had become most unaccountably\r\ninterestednay even excited perhaps there was something amid all\r\nthe extravagant demeanor of legrandsome air of forethought or of\r\ndeliberationwhich impressed me i dug eagerly and now and then\r\ncaught myself actually looking with something that very much\r\nresembled expectation for the fancied treasure the vision of which\r\nhad demented my unfortunate companion at a period when such vagaries\r\nof thought most fully possessed me and when we had been at work\r\nperhaps an hour and a half we were again interrupted by the violent\r\nhowlings of the dog his uneasiness in the first instance had been\r\nevidently but the result of playfulness or caprice but he now assumed\r\na bitter and serious tone upon jupiters again attempting to muzzle\r\nhim he made furious resistance and leaping into the hole tore up\r\nthe mould frantically with his claws in a few seconds he had\r\nuncovered a mass of human bones forming two complete skeletons\r\nintermingled with several buttons of metal and what appeared to be\r\nthe dust of decayed woollen one or two strokes of a spade upturned\r\nthe blade of a large spanish knife and as he dug farther three or\r\nfour loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light\r\n\r\nat sight of these the joy of jupiter could scarcely be restrained but\r\nthe countenance of his master wore an air of extreme\r\ndisappointment he urged us however to continue our exertions and\r\nthe words were hardly uttered when i stumbled and fell forward having\r\ncaught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried\r\nin the loose earth\r\n\r\nwe now worked in earnest and never did i pass ten minutes of more\r\nintense excitement during this interval we had fairly unearthed an\r\noblong chest of wood which from its perfect preservation and\r\nwonderful hardness had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing\r\nprocessperhaps that of the bichloride of mercury this box was three\r\nfeet and a half long three feet broad and two and a half feet\r\ndeep it was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron riveted and\r\nforming a kind of trelliswork over the whole on each side of the\r\nchest near the top were three rings of ironsix in allby means of\r\nwhich a firm hold could be obtained by six persons  our utmost united\r\nendeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its\r\nbed we at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight\r\nluckily the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding\r\nbolts these we drew backtrembling and panting with anxiety in an\r\ninstant a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us as\r\nthe rays of the lanterns fell within the pit there flashed upwards\r\nfrom a confused heap of gold and of jewels a glow and a glare that\r\nabsolutely dazzled our eyes\r\n\r\ni shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which i\r\ngazed amazement was of course predominant legrand appeared\r\nexhausted with excitement and spoke very few words jupiters\r\ncountenance wore for some minutes as deadly a pallor as it is\r\npossible in the nature of things for any negros visage to assume\r\nhe seemed stupifiedthunderstricken presently he fell upon his\r\nknees in the pit and burying his naked arms up to the elbows in\r\ngold let them there remain as if enjoying the luxury of a bath at\r\nlength with a deep sigh he exclaimed as if in a soliloquy\r\n\r\nand dis all cum ob de goolebug de putty goolebug  de poor little\r\ngoolebug what i boosed in dat sabage kind ob style aint you shamed\r\nob yourself niggeranswer me dat\r\n\r\nit became necessary at last that i should arouse both master and\r\nvalet to the expediency of removing the treasure it was growing late\r\nand it behooved us to make exertion that we might get everything\r\nhoused before daylight it was difficult to say what should be done\r\nand much time was spent in deliberationso confused were the ideas of\r\nall we finally lightened the box by removing twothirds of its\r\ncontents when we were enabled with some trouble to raise it from\r\nthe hole the articles taken out were deposited among the brambles\r\nand the dog left to guard them with strict orders from jupiter\r\nneither upon any pretence to stir from the spot nor to open his\r\nmouth until our return we then hurriedly made for home with the\r\nchest reaching the hut in safety but after excessive toil at one\r\noclock in the morning worn out as we were it was not in human\r\nnature to do more just now we rested until two and had supper\r\nstarting for the hills immediately afterwards armed with three stout\r\nsacks which by good luck were upon the premises a little before four\r\nwe arrived at the pit divided the remainder of the booty as equally\r\nas might be among us and leaving the holes unfilled again set out\r\nfor the hut at which for the second time we deposited our golden\r\nburdens just as the first streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the\r\ntreetops in the east\r\n\r\nwe were now thoroughly broken down but the intense excitement of the\r\ntime denied us repose after an unquiet slumber of some three or four\r\nhours duration we arose as if by preconcert to make examination of\r\nour treasure\r\n\r\nthe chest had been full to the brim and we spent the whole day and\r\nthe greater part of the next night in a scrutiny of its contents\r\nthere had been nothing like order or arrangement  everything had been\r\nheaped in promiscuously having assorted all with care we found\r\nourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first\r\nsupposed in coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty\r\nthousand dollars estimating the value of the pieces as accurately as\r\nwe could by the tables of the period there was not a particle of\r\nsilver all was gold of antique date and of great variety french\r\nspanish and german money with a few english guineas and some\r\ncounters of which we had never seen specimens before there were\r\nseveral very large and heavy coins so worn that we could make nothing\r\nof their inscriptions there was no american money  the value of the\r\njewels we found more difficulty in estimating  there were\r\ndiamondssome of them exceedingly large and finea hundred and ten\r\nin all and not one of them small eighteen rubies of remarkable\r\nbrilliancy three hundred and ten emeralds all very beautiful and\r\ntwentyone sapphires with an opal these stones had all been broken\r\nfrom their settings and thrown loose in the chest the settings\r\nthemselves which we picked out from among the other gold appeared to\r\nhave been beaten up with hammers as if to prevent identification\r\nbesides all this there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments\r\nnearly two hundred massive finger and earrings rich chainsthirty\r\nof these if i remember eightythree very large and heavy crucifixes\r\nfive gold censers of great value a prodigious golden punchbowl\r\nornamented with richly chased vineleaves and bacchanalian figures\r\nwith two swordhandles exquisitely embossed and many other smaller\r\narticles which i cannot recollect the weight of these valuables\r\nexceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois and in this\r\nestimate i have not included one hundred and ninetyseven superb gold\r\nwatches three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars if\r\none many of them were very old and as timekeepers valueless the\r\nworks having suffered more or less from corrosion but all were richly\r\njewelled and in cases of great worth we estimated the entire contents\r\nof the chest that night at a million and a half of dollars and\r\nupon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels a few being\r\nretained for our own use it was found that we had greatly\r\nundervalued the treasure\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen at length we had concluded our examination and the intense\r\nexcitement of the time had in some measure subsided legrand who saw\r\nthat i was dying with impatience for a solution of this most\r\nextraordinary riddle entered into a full detail of all the\r\ncircumstances connected with it\r\n\r\nyou remember said he the night when i handed you the rough sketch\r\ni had made of the scarabæus you recollect also that i became\r\nquite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a\r\ndeathshead when you first made this assertion i thought you were\r\njesting but afterwards i called to mind the peculiar spots on the\r\nback of the insect and admitted to myself that your remark had some\r\nlittle foundation in fact still the sneer at my graphic powers\r\nirritated mefor i am considered a good artistand therefore when\r\nyou handed me the scrap of parchment i was about to crumple it up and\r\nthrow it angrily into the fire\r\n\r\nthe scrap of paper you mean said i\r\n\r\nno it had much of the appearance of paper and at first i supposed\r\nit to be such but when i came to draw upon it i discovered it at\r\nonce to be a piece of very thin parchment  it was quite dirty you\r\nremember well as i was in the very act of crumpling it up my glance\r\nfell upon the sketch at which you had been looking and you may\r\nimagine my astonishment when i perceived in fact the figure of a\r\ndeathshead just where it seemed to me i had made the drawing of\r\nthe beetle for a moment i was too much amazed to think with accuracy\r\ni knew that my design was very different in detail from thisalthough\r\nthere was a certain similarity in general outline  presently i took a\r\ncandle and seating myself at the other end of the room proceeded to\r\nscrutinize the parchment more closely upon turning it over i saw my\r\nown sketch upon the reverse just as i had made it my first idea\r\nnow was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of\r\noutlineat the singular coincidence involved in the fact that\r\nunknown to me there should have been a skull upon the other side of\r\nthe parchment immediately beneath my figure of the scarabæus and\r\nthat this skull not only in outline but in size should so closely\r\nresemble my drawing i say the singularity of this coincidence\r\nabsolutely stupified me for a time this is the usual effect of such\r\ncoincidences the mind struggles to establish a connectiona sequence\r\nof cause and effectand being unable to do so suffers a species of\r\ntemporary paralysis but when i recovered from this stupor there\r\ndawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more\r\nthan the coincidence  i began distinctly positively to remember\r\nthat there had been no drawing on the parchment when i made my\r\nsketch of the scarabæus i became perfectly certain of this for i\r\nrecollected turning up first one side and then the other in search of\r\nthe cleanest spot had the skull been then there of course i could\r\nnot have failed to notice it here was indeed a mystery which i felt\r\nit impossible to explain but even at that early moment there seemed\r\nto glimmer faintly within the most remote and secret chambers of my\r\nintellect a glowwormlike conception of that truth which last\r\nnights adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration i arose\r\nat once and putting the parchment securely away dismissed all\r\nfarther reflection until i should be alone\r\n\r\nwhen you had gone and when jupiter was fast asleep i betook myself\r\nto a more methodical investigation of the affair in the first place i\r\nconsidered the manner in which the parchment had come into my\r\npossession the spot where we discovered the scarabæus was on the\r\ncoast of the mainland about a mile eastward of the island and but a\r\nshort distance above highwater mark upon my taking hold of it it\r\ngave me a sharp bite which caused me to let it drop jupiter with\r\nhis accustomed caution before seizing the insect which had flown\r\ntowards him looked about him for a leaf or something of that nature\r\nby which to take hold of it it was at this moment that his eyes and\r\nmine also fell upon the scrap of parchment which i then supposed to\r\nbe paper it was lying halfburied in the sand a corner sticking\r\nup near the spot where we found it i observed the remnants of the\r\nhull of what appeared to have been a ships long boat the wreck\r\nseemed to have been there for a very great while for the resemblance\r\nto boat timbers could scarcely be traced\r\n\r\nwell jupiter picked up the parchment wrapped the beetle in it and\r\ngave it to me soon afterwards we turned to go home and on the way\r\nmet lieutenant g  i showed him the insect and he begged me to\r\nlet him take it to the fort on my consenting he thrust it forthwith\r\ninto his waistcoat pocket without the parchment in which it had been\r\nwrapped and which i had continued to hold in my hand during his\r\ninspection  perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind and thought it\r\nbest to make sure of the prize at onceyou know how enthusiastic he\r\nis on all subjects connected with natural history at the same time\r\nwithout being conscious of it i must have deposited the parchment in\r\nmy own pocket\r\n\r\nyou remember that when i went to the table for the purpose of making\r\na sketch of the beetle i found no paper where it was usually kept i\r\nlooked in the drawer and found none there i searched my pockets\r\nhoping to find an old letter and then my hand fell upon the\r\nparchment i thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my\r\npossession for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force\r\n\r\nno doubt you will think me fancifulbut i had already established a\r\nkind of connection i had put together two links of a great chain\r\nthere was a boat lying on a seacoast and not far from the boat was a\r\nparchmentnot a paperwith a skull depicted on it you will of\r\ncourse ask where is the connection i reply that the skull or\r\ndeathshead is the wellknown emblem of the pirate the flag of the\r\ndeathshead is hoisted in all engagements\r\n\r\ni have said that the scrap was parchment and not paper  parchment\r\nis durablealmost imperishable matters of little moment are rarely\r\nconsigned to parchment since for the mere ordinary purposes of\r\ndrawing or writing it is not nearly so well adapted as paper this\r\nreflection suggested some meaningsome relevancyin the deathshead\r\ni did not fail to observe also the form of the parchment although\r\none of its corners had been by some accident destroyed it could be\r\nseen that the original form was oblong it was just such a slip\r\nindeed as might have been chosen for a memorandumfor a record of\r\nsomething to be long remembered and carefully preserved\r\n\r\nbut i interposed you say that the skull was not upon the\r\nparchment when you made the drawing of the beetle  how then do you\r\ntrace any connection between the boat and the skullsince this\r\nlatter according to your own admission must have been designed god\r\nonly knows how or by whom at some period subsequent to your sketching\r\nthe scarabæus\r\n\r\nah hereupon turns the whole mystery although the secret at this\r\npoint i had comparatively little difficulty in solving my steps were\r\nsure and could afford but a single result i reasoned for example\r\nthus when i drew the scarabæus there was no skull apparent on the\r\nparchment when i had completed the drawing i gave it to you and\r\nobserved you narrowly until you returned it you therefore did not\r\ndesign the skull and no one else was present to do it then it was\r\nnot done by human agency and nevertheless it was done\r\n\r\nat this stage of my reflections i endeavored to remember and did\r\nremember with entire distinctness every incident which occurred\r\nabout the period in question the weather was chilly o rare and happy\r\naccident and a fire was blazing on the hearth i was heated with\r\nexercise and sat near the table you however had drawn a chair close\r\nto the chimney  just as i placed the parchment in your hand and as\r\nyou were in the act of inspecting it wolf the newfoundland entered\r\nand leaped upon your shoulders with your left hand you caressed him\r\nand kept him off while your right holding the parchment was\r\npermitted to fall listlessly between your knees and in close\r\nproximity to the fire at one moment i thought the blaze had caught\r\nit and was about to caution you but before i could speak you had\r\nwithdrawn it and were engaged in its examination when i considered\r\nall these particulars i doubted not for a moment that heat had been\r\nthe agent in bringing to light on the parchment the skull which i\r\nsaw designed on it you are well aware that chemical preparations\r\nexist and have existed time out of mind by means of which it is\r\npossible to write on either paper or vellum so that the characters\r\nshall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire\r\nzaffre digested in aqua regia and diluted with four times its\r\nweight of water is sometimes employed a green tint results the\r\nregulus of cobalt dissolved in spirit of nitre gives a red these\r\ncolors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material\r\nwritten upon cools but again become apparent upon the reapplication\r\nof heat\r\n\r\ni now scrutinized the deathshead with care its outer edgesthe\r\nedges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellumwere far more\r\ndistinct than the others it was clear that the action of the\r\ncaloric had been imperfect or unequal  i immediately kindled a fire\r\nand subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat at\r\nfirst the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the\r\nskull but on persevering in the experiment there became visible at\r\nthe corner of the slip diagonally opposite to the spot in which the\r\ndeathshead was delineated the figure of what i at first supposed to\r\nbe a goat a closer scrutiny however satisfied me that it was\r\nintended for a kid\r\n\r\nha ha said i to be sure i have no right to laugh at youa\r\nmillion and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirthbut you\r\nare not about to establish a third link in your chain you will not\r\nfind any especial connection between your pirates and a goat pirates\r\nyou know have nothing to do with goats they appertain to the farming\r\ninterest\r\n\r\nbut i have just said that the figure was not that of a goat\r\n\r\nwell a kid thenpretty much the same thing\r\n\r\npretty much but not altogether said legrand you may have heard\r\nof one captain kidd i at once looked on the figure of the animal as\r\na kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature i say signature\r\nbecause its position on the vellum suggested this idea the\r\ndeathshead at the corner diagonally opposite had in the same\r\nmanner the air of a stamp or seal  but i was sorely put out by the\r\nabsence of all elseof the body to my imagined instrumentof the\r\ntext for my context\r\n\r\ni presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the\r\nsignature\r\n\r\nsomething of that kind the fact is i felt irresistibly impressed\r\nwith a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending i can\r\nscarcely say why perhaps after all it was rather a desire than an\r\nactual beliefbut do you know that jupiters silly words about the\r\nbug being of solid gold had a remarkable effect on my fancy and then\r\nthe series of accidents and coincidencesthese were so very\r\nextraordinary  do you observe how mere an accident it was that these\r\nevents should have occurred on the sole day of all the year in which\r\nit has been or may be sufficiently cool for fire and that without\r\nthe fire or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment\r\nin which he appeared i should never have become aware of the\r\ndeathshead and so never the possessor of the treasure\r\n\r\nbut proceedi am all impatience\r\n\r\nwell you have heard of course the many stories currentthe\r\nthousand vague rumors afloat about money buried somewhere on the\r\natlantic coast by kidd and his associates  these rumors must have\r\nhad some foundation in fact and that the rumors have existed so long\r\nand so continuously could have resulted it appeared to me only from\r\nthe circumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed\r\nhad kidd concealed his plunder for a time and afterwards reclaimed\r\nit the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present\r\nunvarying form you will observe that the stories told are all about\r\nmoneyseekers not about moneyfinders  had the pirate recovered his\r\nmoney there the affair would have dropped it seemed to me that some\r\naccidentsay the loss of a memorandum indicating its localityhad\r\ndeprived him of the means of recovering it and that this accident had\r\nbecome known to his followers who otherwise might never have heard\r\nthat treasure had been concealed at all and who busying themselves\r\nin vain because unguided attempts to regain it had given first\r\nbirth and then universal currency to the reports which are now so\r\ncommon have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed\r\nalong the coast\r\n\r\nnever\r\n\r\nbut that kidds accumulations were immense is well known i took it\r\nfor granted therefore that the earth still held them and you will\r\nscarcely be surprised when i tell you that i felt a hope nearly\r\namounting to certainty that the parchment so strangely found involved\r\na lost record of the place of deposit\r\n\r\nbut how did you proceed\r\n\r\ni held the vellum again to the fire after increasing the heat but\r\nnothing appeared i now thought it possible that the coating of dirt\r\nmight have something to do with the failure so i carefully rinsed the\r\nparchment by pouring warm water over it and having done this i\r\nplaced it in a tin pan with the skull downwards and put the pan upon\r\na furnace of lighted charcoal in a few minutes the pan having become\r\nthoroughly heated i removed the slip and to my inexpressible joy\r\nfound it spotted in several places with what appeared to be figures\r\narranged in lines again i placed it in the pan and suffered it to\r\nremain another minute upon taking it off the whole was just as you\r\nsee it now\r\n\r\nhere legrand having reheated the parchment submitted it to my\r\ninspection the following characters were rudely traced in a red\r\ntint between the deathshead and the goat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut said i returning him the slip i am as much in the dark as\r\never were all the jewels of golconda awaiting me on my solution of\r\nthis enigma i am quite sure that i should be unable to earn them\r\n\r\nand yet said legrand the solution is by no means so difficult as\r\nyou might be led to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the\r\ncharacters these characters as any one might readily guess form a\r\ncipherthat is to say they convey a meaning but then from what is\r\nknown of kidd i could not suppose him capable of constructing any of\r\nthe more abstruse cryptographs i made up my mind at once that this\r\nwas of a simple speciessuch however as would appear to the crude\r\nintellect of the sailor absolutely insoluble without the key\r\n\r\nand you really solved it\r\n\r\nreadily i have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times\r\ngreater circumstances and a certain bias of mind have led me to\r\ntake interest in such riddles and it may well be doubted whether\r\nhuman ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human\r\ningenuity may not by proper application resolve in fact having\r\nonce established connected and legible characters i scarcely gave a\r\nthought to the mere difficulty of developing their import\r\n\r\nin the present caseindeed in all cases of secret writingthe first\r\nquestion regards the language of the cipher for the principles of\r\nsolution so far especially as the more simple ciphers are\r\nconcerned depend on and are varied by the genius of the particular\r\nidiom in general there is no alternative but experiment directed by\r\nprobabilities of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution\r\nuntil the true one be attained but with the cipher now before us\r\nall difficulty is removed by the signature the pun upon the word\r\nkidd is appreciable in no other language than the english but for\r\nthis consideration i should have begun my attempts with the spanish\r\nand french as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most\r\nnaturally have been written by a pirate of the spanish main as it\r\nwas i assumed the cryptograph to be english\r\n\r\nyou observe there are no divisions between the words  had there been\r\ndivisions the task would have been comparatively easy  in such case\r\ni should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter\r\nwords and had a word of a single letter occurred as is most likely\r\na or i for example i should have considered the solution as\r\nassured  but there being no division my first step was to ascertain\r\nthe predominant letters as well as the least frequent  counting all\r\ni constructed a table thus\r\n\r\nof the character   there are \r\n                           \r\n                           \r\n                          \r\n                           \r\n                           \r\n                           \r\n                           \r\n                            \r\n                           \r\n                           \r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n\r\nnow in english the letter which most frequently occurs is e\r\nafterwards the succession runs thus a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m\r\nw b k p q x z e predominates however so remarkably that an\r\nindividual sentence of any length is rarely seen in which it is not\r\nthe prevailing character\r\n\r\nhere then we have in the very beginning the groundwork for\r\nsomething more than a mere guess the general use which may be made of\r\nthe table is obviousbut in this particular cipher we shall only\r\nvery partially require its aid as our predominant character is  we\r\nwill commence by assuming it as the e of the natural alphabet to\r\nverify the supposition let us observe if the  be seen often in\r\ncouplesfor e is doubled with great frequency in englishin such\r\nwords for example as meet fleet speed seen been\r\nagree etc in the present instance we see it doubled no less than\r\nfive times although the cryptograph is brief\r\n\r\nlet us assume  then as e now of all words in the language\r\nthe is most usual let us see therefore whether there are not\r\nrepetitions of any three characters in the same order of collocation\r\nthe last of them being  if we discover repetitions of such letters\r\nso arranged they will most probably represent the word the on\r\ninspection we find no less than seven such arrangements the\r\ncharacters being  we may therefore assume that the semicolon\r\nrepresents t that  represents h and that  represents ethe\r\nlast being now well confirmed thus a great step has been taken\r\n\r\nbut having established a single word we are enabled to establish a\r\nvastly important point that is to say several commencements and\r\nterminations of other words let us refer for example to the last\r\ninstance but one in which combination  occursnot far from the\r\nend of the cipher  we know that the semicolon immediately ensuing is\r\nthe commencement of a word and of the six characters succeeding this\r\nthe we are cognizant of no less than five let us set these\r\ncharacters down thus by the letters we know them to represent\r\nleaving a space for the unknown\r\n\r\n  t eeth\r\n\r\nhere we are enabled at once to discard the th as forming no\r\nportion of the word commencing with the first t since by\r\nexperiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy\r\nwe perceive that no word can be formed of which this th can be a\r\npart we are thus narrowed into\r\n\r\n  t ee\r\n\r\nand going through the alphabet if necessary as before we arrive at\r\nthe word tree as the sole possible reading we thus gain another\r\nletter r represented by  with the words the tree in\r\njuxtaposition\r\n\r\nlooking beyond these words for a short distance we again see the\r\ncombination  and employ it by way of termination to what\r\nimmediately precedes we have thus this arrangement\r\n\r\n  the tree  the\r\n\r\nor substituting the natural letters where known it reads thus\r\n\r\n  the tree thrh the\r\n\r\nnow if in place of the unknown characters we leave blank spaces\r\nor substitute dots we read thus\r\n\r\n  the tree thr    h the\r\n\r\nwhen the word through makes itself evident at once but this\r\ndiscovery gives us three new letters o u and g represented by\r\n  and \r\n\r\nlooking now narrowly through the cipher for combinations of known\r\ncharacters we find not very far from the beginning this\r\narrangement\r\n\r\n   or egree\r\n\r\nwhich plainly is the conclusion of the word degree and gives us\r\nanother letter d represented by \r\n\r\nfour letters beyond the word degree we perceive the combination\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\ntranslating the known characters and representing the unknown by\r\ndots as before we read thus\r\n\r\n  th  rtee\r\n\r\nan arrangement immediately suggestive of the word thirteen and\r\nagain furnishing us with two new characters i and n represented\r\nby  and \r\n\r\nreferring now to the beginning of the cryptograph we find the\r\ncombination\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\ntranslating as before we obtain\r\n\r\n  good\r\n\r\nwhich assures us that the first letter is a and that the first two\r\nwords are a good\r\n\r\nto avoid confusion it is now time that we arrange our key as far as\r\ndiscovered in a tabular form it will stand thus\r\n\r\n  represents a\r\n            d\r\n            e\r\n            g\r\n            h\r\n            i\r\n            n\r\n            o\r\n            r\r\n            t\r\n\r\nwe have therefore no less than ten of the most important letters\r\nrepresented and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details of\r\nthe solution i have said enough to convince you that ciphers of this\r\nnature are readily soluble and to give you some insight into the\r\nrationale of their development but be assured that the specimen\r\nbefore us appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph it\r\nnow only remains to give you the full translation of the characters\r\nupon the parchment  as unriddled here it is\r\n\r\na good glass in the bishops hostel in the devils seat twentyone\r\ndegrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch\r\nseventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the deathshead a\r\nbee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out\r\n\r\nbut said i the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as\r\never how is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon\r\nabout devils seats deathsheads and bishops hotels\r\n\r\ni confess replied legrand that the matter still wears a serious\r\naspect when regarded with a casual glance my first endeavor was to\r\ndivide the sentence into the natural division intended by the\r\ncryptographist\r\n\r\nyou mean to punctuate it\r\n\r\nsomething of that kind\r\n\r\nbut how was it possible to effect this\r\n\r\ni reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his\r\nwords together without division so as to increase the difficulty of\r\nsolution  now a not overacute man in pursuing such an object\r\nwould be nearly certain to overdo the matter  when in the course of\r\nhis composition he arrived at a break in his subject which would\r\nnaturally require a pause or a point he would be exceedingly apt to\r\nrun his characters at this place more than usually close\r\ntogether if you will observe the ms in the present instance you\r\nwill easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding acting on this\r\nhint i made the division thus\r\n\r\na good glass in the bishops hostel in the devils seattwentyone\r\ndegrees and thirteen minutesnortheast and by northmain branch\r\nseventh limb east sideshoot from the left eye of the deathsheada\r\n\r\nbee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out\r\n\r\neven this division said i leaves me still in the dark\r\n\r\nit left me also in the dark replied legrand for a few days\r\nduring which i made diligent inquiry in the neighborhood of\r\nsullivans island for any building which went by the name of the\r\nbishops hotel for of course i dropped the obsolete word\r\nhostel gaining no information on the subject i was on the point of\r\nextending my sphere of search and proceeding in a more systematic\r\nmanner when one morning it entered into my head quite suddenly that\r\nthis bishops hostel might have some reference to an old family of\r\nthe name of bessop which time out of mind had held possession of an\r\nancient manorhouse about four miles to the northward of the\r\nisland i accordingly went over to the plantation and reinstituted my\r\ninquiries among the older negroes of the place at length one of the\r\nmost aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as\r\nbessops castle and thought that she could guide me to it but that\r\nit was not a castle nor a tavern but a high rock\r\n\r\ni offered to pay her well for her trouble and after some demur she\r\nconsented to accompany me to the spot we found it without much\r\ndifficulty when dismissing her i proceeded to examine the place\r\nthe castle consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and\r\nrocksone of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well\r\nas for its insulated and artificial appearance i clambered to its\r\napex and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done\r\n\r\nwhile i was busied in reflection my eyes fell on a narrow ledge in\r\nthe eastern face of the rock perhaps a yard below the summit upon\r\nwhich i stood this ledge projected about eighteen inches and was not\r\nmore than a foot wide while a niche in the cliff just above it gave\r\nit a rude resemblance to one of the hollowbacked chairs used by our\r\nancestors i made no doubt that here was the devils seat alluded to\r\nin the ms and now i seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle\r\n\r\nthe good glass i knew could have reference to nothing but a\r\ntelescope for the word glass is rarely employed in any other sense\r\nby seamen now here i at once saw was a telescope to be used and a\r\ndefinite point of view admitting no variation from which to use\r\nit nor did i hesitate to believe that the phrases twentyone\r\ndegrees and thirteen minutes and northeast and by north were\r\nintended as directions for the levelling of the glass greatly excited\r\nby these discoveries i hurried home procured a telescope and\r\nreturned to the rock\r\n\r\ni let myself down to the ledge and found that it was impossible to\r\nretain a seat on it unless in one particular position  this fact\r\nconfirmed my preconceived idea i proceeded to use the glass of\r\ncourse the twentyone degrees and thirteen minutes could allude to\r\nnothing but elevation above the visible horizon since the horizontal\r\ndirection was clearly indicated by the words northeast and by\r\nnorth this latter direction i at once established by means of a\r\npocketcompass then pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of\r\ntwentyone degrees of elevation as i could do it by guess i moved it\r\ncautiously up or down until my attention was arrested by a circular\r\nrift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its\r\nfellows in the distance in the centre of this rift i perceived a\r\nwhite spot but could not at first distinguish what it was\r\nadjusting the focus of the telescope i again looked and now made it\r\nout to be a human skull\r\n\r\non this discovery i was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved\r\nfor the phrase main branch seventh limb east side could refer\r\nonly to the position of the skull on the tree while shoot from the\r\nleft eye of the deathshead admitted also of but one\r\ninterpretation in regard to a search for buried treasure i perceived\r\nthat the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull\r\nand that a beeline or in other words a straight line drawn from\r\nthe nearest point of the trunk through the shot or the spot where\r\nthe bullet fell and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet\r\nwould indicate a definite pointand beneath this point i thought it\r\nat least possible that a deposit of value lay concealed\r\n\r\nall this i said is exceedingly clear and although ingenious\r\nstill simple and explicit when you left the bishops hotel what\r\nthen\r\n\r\nwhy having carefully taken the bearings of the tree i turned\r\nhomewards the instant that i left the devils seat however the\r\ncircular rift vanished nor could i get a glimpse of it afterwards\r\nturn as i would what seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole\r\nbusiness is the fact for repeated experiment has convinced me it\r\nis a fact that the circular opening in question is visible from no\r\nother attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge\r\non the face of the rock\r\n\r\nin this expedition to the bishops hotel i had been attended by\r\njupiter who had no doubt observed for some weeks past the\r\nabstraction of my demeanor and took especial care not to leave me\r\nalone but on the next day getting up very early i contrived to give\r\nhim the slip and went into the hills in search of the tree after\r\nmuch toil i found it  when i came home at night my valet proposed to\r\ngive me a flogging with the rest of the adventure i believe you are\r\nas well acquainted as myself\r\n\r\ni suppose said i you missed the spot in the first attempt at\r\ndigging through jupiters stupidity in letting the bug fall through\r\nthe right instead of through the left eye of the skull\r\n\r\nprecisely this mistake made a difference of about two inches and a\r\nhalf in the shotthat is to say in the position of the peg nearest\r\nthe tree and had the treasure been beneath the shot the error\r\nwould have been of little moment but the shot together with the\r\nnearest point of the tree were merely two points for the\r\nestablishment of a line of direction of course the error however\r\ntrivial in the beginning increased as we proceeded with the line\r\nand by the time we had gone fifty feet threw us quite off the\r\nscent but for my deepseated convictions that treasure was here\r\nsomewhere actually buried we might have had all our labor in vain\r\n\r\ni presume the fancy of the skullof letting fall a bullet through\r\nthe skulls eyewas suggested to kidd by the piratical flag no doubt\r\nhe felt a kind of poetical consistency in recovering his money through\r\nthis ominous insignium\r\n\r\nperhaps so still i cannot help thinking that common sense had quite\r\nas much to do with the matter as poetical consistency to be visible\r\nfrom the devils seat it was necessary that the object if small\r\nshould be white and there is nothing like your human skull for\r\nretaining and even increasing its whiteness under exposure to all\r\nvicissitudes of weather\r\n\r\nbut your grandiloquence and your conduct in swinging the beetlehow\r\nexcessively odd i was sure you were mad  and why did you insist on\r\nletting fall the bug instead of a bullet from the skull\r\n\r\nwhy to be frank i felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions\r\ntouching my sanity and so resolved to punish you quietly in my own\r\nway by a little bit of sober mystification  for this reason i swung\r\nthe beetle and for this reason i let it fall from the tree an\r\nobservation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter\r\nidea\r\n\r\nyes i perceive and now there is only one point which puzzles\r\nme what are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole\r\n\r\nthat is a question i am no more able to answer than yourself  there\r\nseems however only one plausible way of accounting for themand yet\r\nit is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would\r\nimply it is clear that kiddif kidd indeed secreted this treasure\r\nwhich i doubt notit is clear  that he must have had assistance in\r\nthe labor but the worst of this labor concluded he may have thought\r\nit expedient to remove all participants in his secret perhaps a\r\ncouple of blows with a mattock were sufficient while his coadjutors\r\nwere busy in the pit perhaps it required a dozenwho shall tell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe purloined letter\r\n\r\n  nil sapientiæ odiosius acumine nimio\r\n                               seneca\r\n\r\n\r\nat paris just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of  i\r\nwas enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum in\r\ncompany with my friend c auguste dupin in his little back library\r\nor book closet au troisième no  rue dunôt faubourg st\r\ngermain for one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence\r\nwhile each to any casual observer might have seemed intently and\r\nexclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed\r\nthe atmosphere of the chamber for myself however i was mentally\r\ndiscussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation\r\nbetween us at an earlier period of the evening i mean the affair of\r\nthe rue morgue and the mystery attending the murder of marie rogêt i\r\nlooked upon it therefore as something of a coincidence when the\r\ndoor of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old\r\nacquaintance monsieur g the prefect of the parisian police\r\n\r\nwe gave him a hearty welcome for there was nearly half as much of the\r\nentertaining as of the contemptible about the man and we had not seen\r\nhim for several years we had been sitting in the dark and dupin now\r\narose for the purpose of lighting a lamp but sat down again without\r\ndoing so upon gs saying that he had called to consult us or\r\nrather to ask the opinion of my friend about some official business\r\nwhich had occasioned a great deal of trouble\r\n\r\nif it is any point requiring reflection observed dupin as he\r\nforebore to enkindle the wick we shall examine it to better purpose\r\nin the dark\r\n\r\nthat is another of your odd notions said the prefect who had a\r\nfashion of calling everything odd that was beyond his comprehension\r\nand thus lived amid an absolute legion of oddities\r\n\r\nvery true said dupin as he supplied his visitor with a pipe and\r\nrolled towards him a comfortable chair\r\n\r\nand what is the difficulty now i asked nothing more in the\r\nassassination way i hope\r\n\r\noh no nothing of that nature the fact is the business is very\r\nsimple indeed and i make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently\r\nwell ourselves but then i thought dupin would like to hear the\r\ndetails of it because it is so excessively odd\r\n\r\nsimple and odd said dupin\r\n\r\nwhy yes and not exactly that either the fact is we have all been\r\na good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple and yet baffles\r\nus altogether\r\n\r\nperhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at\r\nfault said my friend\r\n\r\nwhat nonsense you do talk replied the prefect laughing heartily\r\n\r\nperhaps the mystery is a little too plain said dupin\r\n\r\noh good heavens who ever heard of such an idea\r\n\r\na little too selfevident\r\n\r\nha ha haha ha haho ho ho roared our visitor profoundly\r\namused o dupin you will be the death of me yet\r\n\r\nand what after all is the matter on hand i asked\r\n\r\nwhy i will tell you replied the prefect as he gave a long\r\nsteady and contemplative puff and settled himself in his chair  i\r\nwill tell you in a few words but before i begin let me caution you\r\nthat this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy and that i\r\nshould most probably lose the position i now hold were it known that i\r\nconfided it to any one\r\n\r\nproceed said i\r\n\r\nor not said dupin\r\n\r\nwell then i have received personal information from a very high\r\nquarter that a certain document of the last importance has been\r\npurloined from the royal apartments the individual who purloined it\r\nis known this beyond a doubt he was seen to take it it is known\r\nalso that it still remains in his possession\r\n\r\nhow is this known asked dupin\r\n\r\nit is clearly inferred replied the prefect from the nature of the\r\ndocument and from the nonappearance of certain results which would\r\nat once arise from its passing out of the robbers possession that\r\nis to say from his employing it as he must design in the end to\r\nemploy it\r\n\r\nbe a little more explicit i said\r\n\r\nwell i may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder\r\na certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely\r\nvaluable  the prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy\r\n\r\nstill i do not quite understand said dupin\r\n\r\nno  well the disclosure of the document to a third person who\r\nshall be nameless would bring in question the honor of a personage of\r\nmost exalted station and this fact gives the holder of the document\r\nan ascendency over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are\r\nso jeopardized\r\n\r\nbut this ascendency i interposed would depend upon the robbers\r\nknowledge of the losers knowledge of the robber  who would dare\r\n\r\nthe thief said g is the minister d who dares all\r\nthings those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man  the method\r\nof the theft was not less ingenious than bold  the document in\r\nquestiona letter to be frankhad been received by the\r\npersonage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir  during its perusal\r\nshe was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted\r\npersonage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it  after\r\na hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer she was forced\r\nto place it open as it was upon a table the address however was\r\nuppermost and the contents thus unexposed the letter escaped\r\nnotice at this juncture enters the minister d his lynx eye\r\nimmediately perceives the paper recognizes the handwriting of the\r\naddress observes the confusion of the personage addressed and\r\nfathoms her secret after some business transactions hurried through\r\nin his ordinary manner he produces a letter somewhat similar to the\r\none in question opens it pretends to read it and then places it in\r\nclose juxtaposition to the other again he converses for some fifteen\r\nminutes upon the public affairs at length in taking leave he takes\r\nalso from the table the letter to which he had no claim its rightful\r\nowner saw but of course dared not call attention to the act in the\r\npresence of the third personage who stood at her elbow the minister\r\ndecamped leaving his own letterone of no importanceupon the\r\ntable\r\n\r\nhere then said dupin to me you have precisely what you demand to\r\nmake the ascendancy completethe robbers knowledge of the losers\r\nknowledge of the robber\r\n\r\nyes replied the prefect and the power thus attained has for some\r\nmonths past been wielded for political purposes to a very dangerous\r\nextent the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced every day\r\nof the necessity of reclaiming her letter but this of course cannot\r\nbe done openly in fine driven to despair she has committed the\r\nmatter to me\r\n\r\nthan whom said dupin amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke no more\r\nsagacious agent could i suppose be desired or even imagined\r\n\r\nyou flatter me replied the prefect but it is possible that some\r\nsuch opinion may have been entertained\r\n\r\nit is clear said i as you observe that the letter is still in\r\npossession of the minister since it is this possession and not any\r\nemployment of the letter which bestows the power  with the\r\nemployment the power departs\r\n\r\ntrue said g and upon this conviction i proceeded my first\r\ncare was to make thorough search of the ministers hotel and here my\r\nchief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his\r\nknowledge beyond all things i have been warned of the danger which\r\nwould result from giving him reason to suspect our design\r\n\r\nbut said i you are quite au fait in these investigations the\r\nparisian police have done this thing often before\r\n\r\noh yes and for this reason i did not despair the habits of the\r\nminister gave me too a great advantage he is frequently absent from\r\nhome all night his servants are by no means numerous they sleep at a\r\ndistance from their masters apartment and being chiefly\r\nneapolitans are readily made drunk i have keys as you know with\r\nwhich i can open any chamber or cabinet in paris for three months a\r\nnight has not passed during the greater part of which i have not been\r\nengaged personally in ransacking the d hotel my honor is\r\ninterested and to mention a great secret the reward is enormous so\r\ni did not abandon the search until i had become fully satisfied the\r\nthief is a more astute man than myself i fancy that i have\r\ninvestigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is\r\npossible that the paper can be concealed\r\n\r\nbut is it not possible i suggested that although the letter may\r\nbe in possession of the minister as it unquestionably is he may have\r\nconcealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises\r\n\r\nthis is barely possible said dupin the present peculiar condition\r\nof affairs at court and especially of those intrigues in which d\r\nis known to be involved would render the instant availability of the\r\ndocumentits susceptibility of being produced at a moments noticea\r\npoint of nearly equal importance with its possession\r\n\r\nits susceptibility of being produced said i\r\n\r\nthat is to say of being destroyed said dupin\r\n\r\ntrue i observed the paper is clearly then upon the premises as\r\nfor its being upon the person of the minister we may consider that as\r\nout of the question\r\n\r\nentirely said the prefect he has been twice waylaid as if by\r\nfootpads and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection\r\n\r\nyou might have spared yourself this trouble said dupin  d i\r\npresume is not altogether a fool and if not must have anticipated\r\nthese waylayings as a matter of course\r\n\r\nnot altogether a fool said g but then hes a poet which i\r\ntake to be only one remove from a fool\r\n\r\ntrue said dupin after a long and thoughtful whiff from his\r\nmeerschaum although i have been guilty of certain doggerel myself\r\n\r\nsuppose you detail said i the particulars of your search\r\n\r\nwhy the fact is we took our time and we searched everywhere i\r\nhave had long experience in these affairs i took the entire building\r\nroom by room devoting the nights of a whole week to each we\r\nexamined first the furniture of each apartment we opened every\r\npossible drawer and i presume you know that to a properly trained\r\npolice agent such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible any man\r\nis a dolt who permits a secret drawer to escape him in a search of\r\nthis kind the thing is so plain there is a certain amount of\r\nbulkof spaceto be accounted for in every cabinet  then we have\r\naccurate rules the fiftieth part of a line could not escape us after\r\nthe cabinets we took the chairs the cushions we probed with the fine\r\nlong needles you have seen me employ from the tables we removed the\r\ntops\r\n\r\nwhy so\r\n\r\nsometimes the top of a table or other similarly arranged piece of\r\nfurniture is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article\r\nthen the leg is excavated the article deposited within the cavity\r\nand the top replaced the bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in\r\nthe same way\r\n\r\nbut could not the cavity be detected by sounding i asked\r\n\r\nby no means if when the article is deposited a sufficient wadding\r\nof cotton be placed around it besides in our case we were obliged to\r\nproceed without noise\r\n\r\nbut you could not have removedyou could not have taken to pieces\r\nall articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to\r\nmake a deposit in the manner you mention  a letter may be compressed\r\ninto a thin spiral roll not differing much in shape or bulk from a\r\nlarge knittingneedle and in this form it might be inserted into the\r\nrung of a chair for example you did not take to pieces all the\r\nchairs\r\n\r\ncertainly not but we did betterwe examined the rungs of every\r\nchair in the hotel and indeed the jointings of every description of\r\nfurniture by the aid of a most powerful microscope had there been\r\nany traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect\r\nit instantly a single grain of gimletdust for example would have\r\nbeen as obvious as an apple any disorder in the gluingany unusual\r\ngaping in the jointswould have sufficed to insure detection\r\n\r\ni presume you looked to the mirrors between the boards and the\r\nplates and you probed the beds and the bedclothes as well as the\r\ncurtains and carpets\r\n\r\nthat of course and when we had absolutely completed every particle\r\nof the furniture in this way then we examined the house itself we\r\ndivided its entire surface into compartments which we numbered so\r\nthat none might be missed then we scrutinized each individual square\r\ninch throughout the premises including the two houses immediately\r\nadjoining with the microscope as before\r\n\r\nthe two houses adjoining i exclaimed you must have had a great\r\ndeal of trouble\r\n\r\nwe had but the reward offered is prodigious\r\n\r\nyou include the grounds about the houses\r\n\r\nall the grounds are paved with bricks they gave us comparatively\r\nlittle trouble we examined the moss between the bricks and found it\r\nundisturbed\r\n\r\nyou looked among ds papers of course and into the books of the\r\nlibrary\r\n\r\ncertainly we opened every package and parcel we not only opened\r\nevery book but we turned over every leaf in each volume not\r\ncontenting ourselves with a mere shake according to the fashion of\r\nsome of our police officers we also measured the thickness of every\r\nbookcover with the most accurate admeasurement and applied to\r\neach the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope had any of the\r\nbindings been recently meddled with it would have been utterly\r\nimpossible that the fact should have escaped observation some five or\r\nsix volumes just from the hands of the binder we carefully probed\r\nlongitudinally with the needles\r\n\r\nyou explored the floors beneath the carpets\r\n\r\nbeyond doubt we removed every carpet and examined the boards with\r\nthe microscope\r\n\r\nand the paper on the walls\r\n\r\nyes\r\n\r\nyou looked into the cellars\r\n\r\nwe did\r\n\r\nthen i said you have been making a miscalculation and the letter\r\nis not upon the premises as you suppose\r\n\r\ni fear you are right there said the prefect and now dupin what\r\nwould you advise me to do\r\n\r\nto make a thorough research of the premises\r\n\r\nthat is absolutely needless replied g i am not more sure that\r\ni breathe than i am that the letter is not at the hotel\r\n\r\ni have no better advice to give you said dupin\r\n\r\nyou have of course an accurate description of the letter\r\n\r\noh yesand here the prefect producing a memorandumbook\r\nproceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal and\r\nespecially of the external appearance of the missing document soon\r\nafter finishing the perusal of this description he took his\r\ndeparture more entirely depressed in spirits than i had ever known\r\nthe good gentleman before\r\n\r\nin about a month afterwards he paid us another visit and found us\r\noccupied very nearly as before he took a pipe and a chair and entered\r\ninto some ordinary conversation at length i said\r\n\r\nwell but g what of the purloined letter i presume you have at\r\nlast made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the\r\nminister\r\n\r\nconfound him say iyes i made the reexamination however as\r\ndupin suggestedbut it was all labor lost as i knew it would be\r\n\r\nhow much was the reward offered did you say asked dupin\r\n\r\nwhy a very great deala very liberal rewardi dont like to say\r\nhow much precisely but one thing i will say that i wouldnt mind\r\ngiving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who\r\ncould obtain me that letter  the fact is it is becoming of more and\r\nmore importance every day and the reward has been lately doubled if\r\nit were trebled however i could do no more than i have done\r\n\r\nwhy yes said dupin drawlingly between the whiffs of his\r\nmeerschaum i reallythink g you have not exerted yourselfto\r\nthe utmost in this matter you mightdo a little more i think eh\r\n\r\nhowin what way\r\n\r\nwhypuff puffyou mightpuff puffemploy counsel in the matter\r\nehpuff puff puff do you remember the story they tell of\r\nabernethy\r\n\r\nno hang abernethy\r\n\r\nto be sure hang him and welcome but once upon a time a certain\r\nrich miser conceived the design of sponging upon this abernethy for a\r\nmedical opinion getting up for this purpose an ordinary\r\nconversation in a private company he insinuated his case to the\r\nphysician as that of an imaginary individual\r\n\r\nwe will suppose said the miser that his symptoms are such and\r\nsuch now doctor what would you have directed him to take\r\n\r\ntake said abernethy why take advice to be sure\r\n\r\nbut said the prefect a little discomposed i am perfectly\r\nwilling to take advice and to pay for it i would really give fifty\r\nthousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter\r\n\r\nin that case replied dupin opening a drawer and producing a\r\ncheckbook you may as well fill me up a check for the amount\r\nmentioned when you have signed it i will hand you the letter\r\n\r\ni was astounded the prefect appeared absolutely thunderstricken for\r\nsome minutes he remained speechless and motionless looking\r\nincredulously at my friend with open mouth and eyes that seemed\r\nstarting from their sockets then apparently recovering himself in\r\nsome measure he seized a pen and after several pauses and vacant\r\nstares finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand\r\nfrancs and handed it across the table to dupin the latter examined\r\nit carefully and deposited it in his pocketbook then unlocking an\r\nescritoire took thence a letter and gave it to the prefect this\r\nfunctionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy opened it with a\r\ntrembling hand cast a rapid glance at its contents and then\r\nscrambling and struggling to the door rushed at length\r\nunceremoniously from the room and from the house without having\r\nuttered a syllable since dupin had requested him to fill up the check\r\n\r\nwhen he had gone my friend entered into some explanations\r\n\r\nthe parisian police he said are exceedingly able in their\r\nway they are persevering ingenious cunning and thoroughly versed\r\nin the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand thus when\r\ng detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the hotel\r\nd i felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory\r\ninvestigationso far as his labors extended\r\n\r\nso far as his labors extended said i\r\n\r\nyes said dupin the measures adopted were not only the best of\r\ntheir kind but carried out to absolute perfection had the letter\r\nbeen deposited within the range of their search these fellows would\r\nbeyond a question have found it\r\n\r\ni merely laughedbut he seemed quite serious in all that he said\r\n\r\nthe measures then he continued were good in their kind and well\r\nexecuted their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case\r\nand to the man a certain set of highly ingenious resources are with\r\nthe prefect a sort of procrustean bed to which he forcibly adapts his\r\ndesigns but he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for\r\nthe matter in hand and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than\r\nhe i knew one about eight years of age whose success at guessing in\r\nthe game of even and odd attracted universal admiration this game\r\nis simple and is played with marbles  one player holds in his hand\r\na number of these toys and demands of another whether that number is\r\neven or odd if the guess is right the guesser wins one if wrong he\r\nloses one the boy to whom i allude won all the marbles of the\r\nschool of course he had some principle of guessing and this lay in\r\nmere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his\r\nopponents for example an arrant simpleton is his opponent and\r\nholding up his closed hand asks are they even or odd our schoolboy\r\nreplies odd and loses but upon the second trial he wins for he\r\nthen says to himself the simpleton had them even upon the first\r\ntrial and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have\r\nthem odd upon the second i will therefore guess odd he guesses odd\r\nand wins now with a simpleton a degree above the first he would have\r\nreasoned thus this fellow finds that in the first instance i guessed\r\nodd and in the second he will propose to himself upon the first\r\nimpulse a simple variation from even to odd as did the first\r\nsimpleton but then a second thought will suggest that this is too\r\nsimple a variation and finally he will decide upon putting it even as\r\nbefore i will therefore guess even he guesses even and wins now\r\nthis mode of reasoning in the schoolboy whom his fellows term\r\nluckywhat in its last analysis is it\r\n\r\nit is merely i said an identification of the reasoners intellect\r\nwith that of his opponent\r\n\r\nit is said dupin and upon inquiring of the boy by what means he\r\neffected the thorough identification in which his success consisted\r\ni received answer as follows when i wish to find out how wise or\r\nhow stupid or how good or how wicked is any one or what are his\r\nthoughts at the moment i fashion the expression of my face as\r\naccurately as possible in accordance with the expression of his and\r\nthen wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or\r\nheart as if to match or correspond with the expression this\r\nresponse of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious\r\nprofundity which has been attributed to rochefoucauld to la bruyère\r\nto machiavelli and to campanella\r\n\r\nand the identification i said of the reasoners intellect with\r\nthat of his opponent depends if i understand you aright upon the\r\naccuracy with which the opponents intellect is admeasured\r\n\r\nfor its practical value it depends upon this replied dupin and\r\nthe prefect and his cohort fail so frequently first by default of\r\nthis identification and secondly by illadmeasurement or rather\r\nthrough nonadmeasurement of the intellect with which they are\r\nengaged they consider only their own ideas of ingenuity and in\r\nsearching for anything hidden advert only to the modes in which\r\nthey would have hidden it they are right in this muchthat their\r\nown ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass but\r\nwhen the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from\r\ntheir own the felon foils them of course this always happens when\r\nit is above their own and very usually when it is below they have no\r\nvariation of principle in their investigations at best when urged by\r\nsome unusual emergencyby some extraordinary rewardthey extend or\r\nexaggerate their old modes of practice without touching their\r\nprinciples  what for example in this case of d has been done\r\nto vary the principle of action what is all this boring and probing\r\nand sounding and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the\r\nsurface of the building into registered square incheswhat is it all\r\nbut an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set\r\nof principles of search which are based upon the one set of notions\r\nregarding human ingenuity to which the prefect in the long routine\r\nof his duty has been accustomed do you not see he has taken it for\r\ngranted that all men proceed to conceal a letternot exactly in a\r\ngimlethole bored in a chair legbut at least in some\r\noutoftheway hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought\r\nwhich would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlethole bored in a\r\nchairleg and do you not see also that such recherchés nooks for\r\nconcealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions and would be\r\nadopted only by ordinary intellects for in all cases of concealment\r\na disposal of the article concealeda disposal of it in this\r\nrecherché manneris in the very first instance presumable and\r\npresumed and thus its discovery depends not at all upon the acumen\r\nbut altogether upon the mere care patience and determination of the\r\nseekers and where the case is of importanceor what amounts to the\r\nsame thing in policial eyes when the reward is of magnitudethe\r\nqualities in question have never been known to fail you will now\r\nunderstand what i meant in suggesting that had the purloined letter\r\nbeen hidden anywhere within the limits of the prefects\r\nexaminationin other words had the principle of its concealment been\r\ncomprehended within the principles of the prefectits discovery would\r\nhave been a matter altogether beyond question this functionary\r\nhowever has been thoroughly mystified and the remote source of his\r\ndefeat lies in the supposition that the minister is a fool because he\r\nhas acquired renown as a poet  all fools are poets this the prefect\r\nfeels and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in\r\nthence inferring that all poets are fools\r\n\r\nbut is this really the poet i asked there are two brothers i\r\nknow and both have attained reputation in letters the minister i\r\nbelieve has written learnedly on the differential calculus he is a\r\nmathematician and no poet\r\n\r\nyou are mistaken i know him well he is both as poet and\r\nmathematician he would reason well as mere mathematician he could\r\nnot have reasoned at all and thus would have been at the mercy of the\r\nprefect\r\n\r\nyou surprise me i said by these opinions which have been\r\ncontradicted by the voice of the world you do not mean to set at\r\nnaught the welldigested idea of centuries the mathematical reason\r\nhas long been regarded as the reason par excellence\r\n\r\nilya à parier replied dupin quoting from chamfort que\r\ntoute idée publique toute convention reçue est une sottise car elle\r\na convenue au plus grand nombre the mathematicians i grant you\r\nhave done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you\r\nallude and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as\r\ntruth with an art worthy a better cause for example they have\r\ninsinuated the term analysis into application to algebra the french\r\nare the originators of this particular deception  but if a term is of\r\nany importanceif words derive any value from applicabilitythen\r\nanalysis conveys algebra about as much as in latin ambitus\r\nimplies ambition religio religion or homines honestia\r\nset of honorable men\r\n\r\nyou have a quarrel on hand i see said i with some of the\r\nalgebraists of paris but proceed\r\n\r\ni dispute the availability and thus the value of that reason which\r\nis cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly\r\nlogical i dispute in particular the reason educed by mathematical\r\nstudy the mathematics are the science of form and quantity\r\nmathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon\r\nform and quantity the great error lies in supposing that even the\r\ntruths of what is called pure algebra are abstract or general\r\ntruths and this error is so egregious that i am confounded at the\r\nuniversality with which it has been received mathematical axioms are\r\nnot axioms of general truth what is true of relationof form and\r\nquantityis often grossly false in regard to morals for example in\r\nthis latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated\r\nparts are equal to the whole in chemistry also the axiom fails in\r\nthe consideration of motive it fails for two motives each of a given\r\nvalue have not necessarily a value when united equal to the sum of\r\ntheir values apart there are numerous other mathematical truths which\r\nare only truths within the limits of relation but the mathematician\r\nargues from his finite truths through habit as if they were of an\r\nabsolutely general applicabilityas the world indeed imagines them to\r\nbe bryant in his very learned mythology mentions an analogous\r\nsource of error when he says that although the pagan fables are not\r\nbelieved yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences\r\nfrom them as existing realities  with the algebraists however who\r\nare pagans themselves the pagan fables are believed and the\r\ninferences are made not so much through lapse of memory as through\r\nan unaccountable addling of the brains in short i neyer yet\r\nencountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal\r\nroots or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his\r\nfaith that x+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q\r\nsay to one of these gentlemen by way of experiment if you please\r\nthat you believe occasions may occur where x+px is not\r\naltogether equal to q and having made him understand what you\r\nmean get out of his reach as speedily as convenient for beyond\r\ndoubt he will endeavor to knock you down\r\n\r\ni mean to say continued dupin while i merely laughed at his last\r\nobservations that if the minister had been no more than a\r\nmathematician the prefect would have been under no necessity of\r\ngiving me this check i knew him however as both mathematician and\r\npoet and my measures were adapted to his capacity with reference to\r\nthe circumstances by which he was surrounded i knew him as courtier\r\ntoo and as a bold intriguant such a man i considered could not\r\nfail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action he could\r\nnot have failed to anticipateand events have proved that he did not\r\nfail to anticipatethe waylayings to which he was subjected he must\r\nhave foreseen i reflected the secret investigations of his\r\npremises his frequent absences from home at night which were hailed\r\nby the prefect as certain aids to his success i regarded only as\r\nruses to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police and\r\nthus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which g in\r\nfact did finally arrivethe conviction that the letter was not upon\r\nthe premises i felt also that the whole train of thought which i\r\nwas at some pains in detailing to you just now concerning the\r\ninvariable principle of policial action in searches for articles\r\nconcealedi felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily\r\npass through the mind of the minister it would imperatively lead him\r\nto despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment  he could not i\r\nreflected be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote\r\nrecess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the\r\neyes to the probes to the gimlets and to the microscopes of the\r\nprefect i saw in fine that he would be driven as a matter of\r\ncourse to simplicity if not deliberately induced to it as a matter\r\nof choice  you will remember perhaps how desperately the prefect\r\nlaughed when i suggested upon our first interview that it was just\r\npossible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so\r\nvery selfevident\r\n\r\nyes said i i remember his merriment well i really thought he\r\nwould have fallen into convulsions\r\n\r\nthe material world continued dupin abounds with very strict\r\nanalogies to the immaterial and thus some color of truth has been\r\ngiven to the rhetorical dogma that metaphor or simile may be made\r\nto strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a description the\r\nprinciple of the vis inertiæ for example seems to be identical in\r\nphysics and metaphysics  it is not more true in the former that a\r\nlarge body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one\r\nand that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty\r\nthan it is in the latter that intellects of the vaster capacity\r\nwhile more forcible more constant and more eventful in their\r\nmovements than those of inferior grade are yet the less readily\r\nmoved and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few\r\nsteps of their progress again have you ever noticed which of the\r\nstreet signs over the shopdoors are the most attractive of\r\nattention\r\n\r\ni have never given the matter a thought i said\r\n\r\nthere is a game of puzzles he resumed which is played upon a\r\nmap one party playing requires another to find a given wordthe name\r\nof town river state or empireany word in short upon the motley\r\nand perplexed surface of the chart a novice in the game generally\r\nseeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely\r\nlettered names but the adept selects such words as stretch in large\r\ncharacters from one end of the chart to the other these like the\r\noverlargely lettered signs and placards of the street escape\r\nobservation by dint of being excessively obvious and here the\r\nphysical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral\r\ninapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those\r\nconsiderations which are too obtrusively and too palpably\r\nselfevident  but this is a point it appears somewhat above or\r\nbeneath the understanding of the prefect he never once thought it\r\nprobable or possible that the minister had deposited the letter\r\nimmediately beneath the nose of the whole world by way of best\r\npreventing any portion of that world from perceiving it\r\n\r\nbut the more i reflected upon the daring dashing and discriminating\r\ningenuity of d upon the fact that the document must always have\r\nbeen at hand if he intended to use it to good purpose and upon the\r\ndecisive evidence obtained by the prefect that it was not hidden\r\nwithin the limits of that dignitarys ordinary searchthe more\r\nsatisfied i became that to conceal this letter the minister had\r\nresorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not\r\nattempting to conceal it at all\r\n\r\nfull of these ideas i prepared myself with a pair of green\r\nspectacles and called one fine morning quite by accident at the\r\nministerial hotel i found d at home yawning lounging and\r\ndawdling as usual and pretending to be in the last extremity of\r\nennui he is perhaps the most really energetic human being now\r\nalivebut that is only when nobody sees him\r\n\r\nto be even with him i complained of my weak eyes and lamented the\r\nnecessity of the spectacles under cover of which i cautiously and\r\nthoroughly surveyed the apartment while seemingly intent only upon\r\nthe conversation of my host\r\n\r\ni paid especial attention to a large writingtable near which he sat\r\nand upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other\r\npapers with one or two musical instruments and a few books here\r\nhowever after a long and very deliberate scrutiny i saw nothing to\r\nexcite particular suspicion\r\n\r\nat length my eyes in going the circuit of the room fell upon a\r\ntrumpery filigree cardrack of pasteboard that hung dangling by a\r\ndirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of\r\nthe mantelpiece in this rack which had three or four compartments\r\nwere five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter this last was\r\nmuch soiled and crumpled  it was torn nearly in two across the\r\nmiddleas if a design in the first instance to tear it entirely up\r\nas worthless had been altered or stayed in the second it had a\r\nlarge black seal bearing the d cipher very conspicuously and\r\nwas addressed in a diminutive female hand to d the minister\r\nhimself it was thrust carelessly and even as it seemed\r\ncontemptuously into one of the upper divisions of the rack\r\n\r\nno sooner had i glanced at this letter than i concluded it to be\r\nthat of which i was in search to be sure it was to all appearance\r\nradically different from the one of which the prefect had read us so\r\nminute a description here the seal was large and black with the\r\nd cipher there it was small and red with the ducal arms of the\r\ns family  here the address to the minister was diminutive and\r\nfeminine there the superscription to a certain royal personage was\r\nmarkedly bold and decided the size alone formed a point of\r\ncorrespondence but then the radicalness of these differences\r\nwhich was excessive the dirt the soiled and torn condition of the\r\npaper so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of d and\r\nso suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the\r\nworthlessness of the document these things together with the\r\nhyperobtrusive situation of this document full in the view of every\r\nvisitor and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which\r\ni had previously arrived these things i say were strongly\r\ncorroborative of suspicion in one who came with the intention to\r\nsuspect\r\n\r\ni protracted my visit as long as possible and while i maintained a\r\nmost animated discussion with the minister upon a topic which i knew\r\nwell had never failed to interest and excite him i kept my attention\r\nreally riveted upon the letter  in this examination i committed to\r\nmemory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack and also\r\nfell at length upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial\r\ndoubt i might have entertained in scrutinizing the edges of the\r\npaper i observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary they\r\npresented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff\r\npaper having been once folded and pressed with a folder is refolded\r\nin a reversed direction in the same creases or edges which had formed\r\nthe original fold  this discovery was sufficient it was clear to me\r\nthat the letter had been turned as a glove inside out redirected\r\nand resealed i bade the minister goodmorning and took my departure\r\nat once leaving a gold snuffbox upon the table\r\n\r\nthe next morning i called for the snuffbox when we resumed quite\r\neagerly the conversation of the preceding day  while thus engaged\r\nhowever a loud report as if of a pistol was heard immediately\r\nbeneath the windows of the hotel and was succeeded by a series of\r\nfearful screams and the shoutings of a mob d rushed to a\r\ncasement threw it open and looked out in the meantime i stepped to\r\nthe cardrack took the letter put it in my pocket and replaced it\r\nby a facsimile so far as regards externals which i had carefully\r\nprepared at my lodgingsimitating the d cipher very readily by\r\nmeans of a seal formed of bread\r\n\r\nthe disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic\r\nbehavior of a man with a musket he had fired it among a crowd of\r\nwomen and children it proved however to have been without ball and\r\nthe fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard when\r\nhe had gone d came from the window whither i had followed him\r\nimmediately upon securing the object in view soon afterwards i bade\r\nhim farewell the pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay\r\n\r\nbut what purpose had you i asked in replacing the letter by a\r\nfacsimile would it not have been better at the first visit to have\r\nseized it openly and departed\r\n\r\nd replied dupin is a desperate man and a man of nerve his\r\nhotel too is not without attendants devoted to his interests had i\r\nmade the wild attempt you suggest i might never have left the\r\nministerial presence alive the good  people of paris might have\r\nheard of me no more but i had an object apart from these\r\nconsiderations you know my political prepossessions in this matter\r\ni act as a partisan of the lady concerned for eighteen months the\r\nminister has had her in his power she has now him in herssince\r\nbeing unaware that the letter is not in his possession he will\r\nproceed with his exactions as if it was thus will he inevitably\r\ncommit himself at once to his political destruction his downfall\r\ntoo will not be more precipitate than awkward it is all very well to\r\ntalk about the facilis descensus averni but in all kinds of\r\nclimbing as catalani said of singing it is far more easy to get up\r\nthan to come down in the present instance i have no sympathyat\r\nleast no pityfor him who descends he is that monstrum horrendum\r\nan unprincipled man of genius i confess however that i should like\r\nvery well to know the precise character of his thoughts when being\r\ndefied by her whom the prefect terms a certain personage he is\r\nreduced to opening the letter which i left for him in the cardrack\r\n\r\n\r\nhow did you put anything particular in it\r\n\r\nwhyit did not seem altogether right to leave
