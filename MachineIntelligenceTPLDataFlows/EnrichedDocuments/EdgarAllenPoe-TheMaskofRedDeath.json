Blood was its Avatar and its seal—the\nredness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness,\nand then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains\nupon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban\nwhich shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And\nthe whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents\nof half an hour.\n\nBut the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his\ndominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale\nand light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and\nwith these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This\nwas an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince’s\nown eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This\nwall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and\nmassy hammers and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of\ningress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within.\nThe abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid\ndefiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the\nmeantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the\nappliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there\nwere ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine.\nAll these and security were within. Without was the “Red Death”.\n\nIt was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and\nwhile the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero\nentertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual\nmagnificence.\n\nIt was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the rooms\nin which it was held. These were seven—an imperial suite. In many\npalaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding\ndoors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the\nwhole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different, as might\nhave been expected from the duke’s love of the _bizarre_. The\napartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little\nmore than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty\nyards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle of\neach wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor\nwhich pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass\nwhose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of\nthe chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for\nexample in blue—and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was\npurple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The\nthird was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished\nand lighted with orange—the fifth with white—the sixth with violet.\nThe seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung\nall over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet\nof the same material and hue. But in this chamber only, the colour of the\nwindows failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were\nscarlet—a deep blood colour. Now in no one of the seven apartments was\nthere any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay\nscattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind\nemanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the\ncorridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a\nheavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the\ntinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a\nmultitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black\nchamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings\nthrough the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so\nwild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of\nthe company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.\n\nIt was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a\ngigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy,\nmonotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and\nthe hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a\nsound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so\npeculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of\nthe orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to\nharken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions;\nand there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the\nchimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and\nthe more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused\nreverie or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter\nat once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as\nif at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the\nother, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar\nemotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three\nthousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet\nanother chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and\ntremulousness and meditation as before.\n\nBut, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The tastes\nof the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colours and effects. He\ndisregarded the _decora_ of mere fashion. His plans were bold and fiery,\nand his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have\nthought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear\nand see and touch him to be _sure_ that he was not.\n\nHe had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the seven\nchambers, upon occasion of this great _fête_; and it was his own guiding\ntaste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were\ngrotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and\nphantasm—much of what has been since seen in “Hernani”. There\nwere arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were\ndelirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There were much of the\nbeautiful, much of the wanton, much of the _bizarre_, something of the\nterrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro\nin the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And\nthese—the dreams—writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms,\nand causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps.\nAnd, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the\nvelvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice\nof the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the\nchime die away—they have endured but an instant—and a light,\nhalf-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music\nswells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever,\ntaking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the\ntripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are\nnow none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there\nflows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes; and the blackness of\nthe sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet,\nthere comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic\nthan any which reaches _their_ ears who indulged in the more remote\ngaieties of the other apartments.\n\nBut these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly\nthe heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there\ncommenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then the music ceased,\nas I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was\nan uneasy cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve strokes\nto be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that\nmore of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the\nthoughtful among those who revelled. And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that\nbefore the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there\nwere many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the\npresence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single\nindividual before. And the rumour of this new presence having spread itself\nwhisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or\nmurmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise—then, finally, of\nterror, of horror, and of disgust.\n\nIn an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed\nthat no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In truth the\nmasquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in\nquestion had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the\nprince’s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most\nreckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly lost,\nto whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest\ncan be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the\ncostume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The\nfigure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of\nthe grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble\nthe countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had\ndifficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if\nnot approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to\nassume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in\n_blood_—and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was\nbesprinkled with the scarlet horror.\n\nWhen the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which, with\na slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to\nand fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment\nwith a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow\nreddened with rage.\n\n“Who dares,”—he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood\nnear him—“who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize\nhim and unmask him—that we may know whom we have to hang, at sunrise,\nfrom the battlements!”\n\nIt was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he\nuttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly,\nfor the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at\nthe waving of his hand.\n\nIt was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers\nby his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this\ngroup in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at\nhand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the\nspeaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the\nmummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand\nto seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince’s\nperson; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the\ncentres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with\nthe same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first,\nthrough the blue chamber to the purple—through the purple to the\ngreen—through the green to the orange—through this again to the\nwhite—and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made\nto arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with\nrage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the\nsix chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had\nseized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid\nimpetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the\nlatter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly\nand confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry—and the dagger dropped\ngleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell\nprostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of\ndespair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black\napartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and\nmotionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror\nat finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled with so\nviolent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.\n\nAnd now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come like a\nthief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed\nhalls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall.

death \n\n\n\n\nproduced by levent kurnaz  html version by al haines\n\n\n\n\nthe masque of the red death\n\nby edgar allan poe\n\n\nthe red death had long devastated the country no pestilence had\never been so fatal or so hideous blood was its avatar and its sealthe\nredness and the horror of blood there were sharp pains and sudden dizziness\nand then profuse bleeding at the pores with dissolution the scarlet stains\nupon the body and especially upon the face of the victim were the pest ban\nwhich shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellowmen and\nthe whole seizure progress and termination of the disease were the incidents\nof half an hour\n\nbut the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious when his\ndominions were half depopulated he summoned to his presence a thousand hale\nand lighthearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court and\nwith these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys this\nwas an extensive and magnificent structure the creation of the princes\nown eccentric yet august taste a strong and lofty wall girdled it in this\nwall had gates of iron the courtiers having entered brought furnaces and\nmassy hammers and welded the bolts they resolved to leave means neither of\ningress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within\nthe abbey was amply provisioned with such precautions the courtiers might bid\ndefiance to contagion the external world could take care of itself in the\nmeantime it was folly to grieve or to think the prince had provided all the\nappliances of pleasure there were buffoons there were improvisatori there\nwere balletdancers there were musicians there was beauty there was wine\nall these and security were within without was the red death\n\nit was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion and\nwhile the pestilence raged most furiously abroad that the prince prospero\nentertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual\nmagnificence\n\nit was a voluptuous scene that masquerade but first let me tell of the rooms\nin which it was held these were sevenan imperial suite in many\npalaces however such suites form a long and straight vista while the folding\ndoors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand so that the view of the\nwhole extent is scarcely impeded here the case was very different as might\nhave been expected from the dukes love of the bizarre the\napartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little\nmore than one at a time there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty\nyards and at each turn a novel effect to the right and left in the middle of\neach wall a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor\nwhich pursued the windings of the suite these windows were of stained glass\nwhose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of\nthe chamber into which it opened that at the eastern extremity was hung for\nexample in blueand vividly blue were its windows the second chamber was\npurple in its ornaments and tapestries and here the panes were purple the\nthird was green throughout and so were the casements the fourth was furnished\nand lighted with orangethe fifth with whitethe sixth with violet\nthe seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung\nall over the ceiling and down the walls falling in heavy folds upon a carpet\nof the same material and hue but in this chamber only the colour of the\nwindows failed to correspond with the decorations the panes here were\nscarleta deep blood colour now in no one of the seven apartments was\nthere any lamp or candelabrum amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay\nscattered to and fro or depended from the roof there was no light of any kind\nemanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers but in the\ncorridors that followed the suite there stood opposite to each window a\nheavy tripod bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the\ntinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room and thus were produced a\nmultitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances but in the western or black\nchamber the effect of the firelight that streamed upon the dark hangings\nthrough the bloodtinted panes was ghastly in the extreme and produced so\nwild a look upon the countenances of those who entered that there were few of\nthe company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all\n\nit was in this apartment also that there stood against the western wall a\ngigantic clock of ebony its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull heavy\nmonotonous clang and when the minutehand made the circuit of the face and\nthe hour was to be stricken there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a\nsound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical but of so\npeculiar a note and emphasis that at each lapse of an hour the musicians of\nthe orchestra were constrained to pause momentarily in their performance to\nharken to the sound and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions\nand there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company and while the\nchimes of the clock yet rang it was observed that the giddiest grew pale and\nthe more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused\nreverie or meditation but when the echoes had fully ceased a light laughter\nat once pervaded the assembly the musicians looked at each other and smiled as\nif at their own nervousness and folly and made whispering vows each to the\nother that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar\nemotion and then after the lapse of sixty minutes which embrace three\nthousand and six hundred seconds of the time that flies there came yet\nanother chiming of the clock and then were the same disconcert and\ntremulousness and meditation as before\n\nbut in spite of these things it was a gay and magnificent revel the tastes\nof the duke were peculiar he had a fine eye for colours and effects he\ndisregarded the decora of mere fashion his plans were bold and fiery\nand his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre there are some who would have\nthought him mad his followers felt that he was not it was necessary to hear\nand see and touch him to be sure that he was not\n\nhe had directed in great part the movable embellishments of the seven\nchambers upon occasion of this great fête and it was his own guiding\ntaste which had given character to the masqueraders be sure they were\ngrotesque there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and\nphantasmmuch of what has been since seen in hernani there\nwere arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments there were\ndelirious fancies such as the madman fashions there were much of the\nbeautiful much of the wanton much of the bizarre something of the\nterrible and not a little of that which might have excited disgust to and fro\nin the seven chambers there stalked in fact a multitude of dreams and\nthesethe dreamswrithed in and about taking hue from the rooms\nand causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps\nand anon there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the\nvelvet and then for a moment all is still and all is silent save the voice\nof the clock the dreams are stifffrozen as they stand but the echoes of the\nchime die awaythey have endured but an instantand a light\nhalfsubdued laughter floats after them as they depart and now again the music\nswells and the dreams live and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever\ntaking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the\ntripods but to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are\nnow none of the maskers who venture for the night is waning away and there\nflows a ruddier light through the bloodcoloured panes and the blackness of\nthe sable drapery appals and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet\nthere comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic\nthan any which reaches their ears who indulged in the more remote\ngaieties of the other apartments\n\nbut these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beat feverishly\nthe heart of life and the revel went whirlingly on until at length there\ncommenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock and then the music ceased\nas i have told and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted and there was\nan uneasy cessation of all things as before but now there were twelve strokes\nto be sounded by the bell of the clock and thus it happened perhaps that\nmore of thought crept with more of time into the meditations of the\nthoughtful among those who revelled and thus too it happened perhaps that\nbefore the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there\nwere many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the\npresence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single\nindividual before and the rumour of this new presence having spread itself\nwhisperingly around there arose at length from the whole company a buzz or\nmurmur expressive of disapprobation and surprisethen finally of\nterror of horror and of disgust\n\nin an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted it may well be supposed\nthat no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation in truth the\nmasquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited but the figure in\nquestion had outheroded herod and gone beyond the bounds of even the\nprinces indefinite decorum there are chords in the hearts of the most\nreckless which cannot be touched without emotion even with the utterly lost\nto whom life and death are equally jests there are matters of which no jest\ncan be made the whole company indeed seemed now deeply to feel that in the\ncostume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed the\nfigure was tall and gaunt and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of\nthe grave the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble\nthe countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had\ndifficulty in detecting the cheat and yet all this might have been endured if\nnot approved by the mad revellers around but the mummer had gone so far as to\nassume the type of the red death his vesture was dabbled in\nbloodand his broad brow with all the features of the face was\nbesprinkled with the scarlet horror\n\nwhen the eyes of the prince prospero fell upon this spectral image which with\na slow and solemn movement as if more fully to sustain its role stalked to\nand fro among the waltzers he was seen to be convulsed in the first moment\nwith a strong shudder either of terror or distaste but in the next his brow\nreddened with rage\n\nwho dareshe demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood\nnear himwho dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery seize\nhim and unmask himthat we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise\nfrom the battlements\n\nit was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince prospero as he\nuttered these words they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly\nfor the prince was a bold and robust man and the music had become hushed at\nthe waving of his hand\n\nit was in the blue room where stood the prince with a group of pale courtiers\nby his side at first as he spoke there was a slight rushing movement of this\ngroup in the direction of the intruder who at the moment was also near at\nhand and now with deliberate and stately step made closer approach to the\nspeaker but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the\nmummer had inspired the whole party there were found none who put forth hand\nto seize him so that unimpeded he passed within a yard of the princes\nperson and while the vast assembly as if with one impulse shrank from the\ncentres of the rooms to the walls he made his way uninterruptedly but with\nthe same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first\nthrough the blue chamber to the purplethrough the purple to the\ngreenthrough the green to the orangethrough this again to the\nwhiteand even thence to the violet ere a decided movement had been made\nto arrest him it was then however that the prince prospero maddening with\nrage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice rushed hurriedly through the\nsix chambers while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had\nseized upon all he bore aloft a drawn dagger and had approached in rapid\nimpetuosity to within three or four feet of the retreating figure when the\nlatter having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment turned suddenly\nand confronted his pursuer there was a sharp cryand the dagger dropped\ngleaming upon the sable carpet upon which instantly afterwards fell\nprostrate in death the prince prospero then summoning the wild courage of\ndespair a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black\napartment and seizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect and\nmotionless within the shadow of the ebony clock gasped in unutterable horror\nat finding the grave cerements and corpselike mask which they handled with so\nviolent a rudeness untenanted by any tangible form\n\nand now was acknowledged the presence of the red death he had come like a\nthief in the night and one by one dropped the revellers in the bloodbedewed\nhalls of their revel and died each in the despairing posture of his fall and\nthe life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay and the\nflames of the tripods expired and darkness and decay and the red death held\nillimitable dominion over all\n\n\n\n\nend of the project gutenberg ebook of the masque of the red death by edgar allan
