The\r\nyoung man and the young girl who sat together on the low tombstone looked\r\nat each other.  They had heard the voices of the two children talking,\r\nbut had not noticed what they said; it was the sentiment, not the sound,\r\nwhich roused their attention.\r\n\r\nThe girl put her finger to her lips to impress silence, and the man\r\nnodded; they sat as still as mice whilst the two children went on\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe scene would have gladdened a painter's heart.  An old churchyard.  The\r\nchurch low and square-towered, with long mullioned windows, the yellow-\r\ngrey stone roughened by age and tender-hued with lichens.  Round it\r\nclustered many tombstones tilted in all directions.  Behind the church a\r\nline of gnarled and twisted yews.\r\n\r\nThe churchyard was full of fine trees.  On one side a magnificent cedar;\r\non the other a great copper beech.  Here and there among the tombs and\r\nheadstones many beautiful blossoming trees rose from the long green\r\ngrass.  The laburnum glowed in the June afternoon sunlight; the lilac,\r\nthe hawthorn and the clustering meadowsweet which fringed the edge of the\r\nlazy stream mingled their heavy sweetness in sleepy fragrance.  The\r\nyellow-grey crumbling walls were green in places with wrinkled\r\nharts-tongues, and were topped with sweet-williams and spreading house-\r\nleek and stone-crop and wild-flowers whose delicious sweetness made for\r\nthe drowsy repose of perfect summer.\r\n\r\nBut amid all that mass of glowing colour the two young figures seated on\r\nthe grey old tomb stood out conspicuously.  The man was in conventional\r\nhunting-dress: red coat, white stock, black hat, white breeches, and top-\r\nboots.  The girl was one of the richest, most glowing, and yet withal\r\ndaintiest figures the eye of man could linger on.  She was in\r\nriding-habit of hunting scarlet cloth; her black hat was tipped forward\r\nby piled-up masses red-golden hair.  Round her neck was a white lawn\r\nscarf in the fashion of a man's hunting-stock, close fitting, and sinking\r\ninto a gold-buttoned waistcoat of snowy twill.  As she sat with the long\r\nskirt across her left arm her tiny black top-boots appeared underneath.\r\nHer gauntleted gloves were of white buckskin; her riding-whip was plaited\r\nof white leather, topped with ivory and banded with gold.\r\n\r\nEven in her fourteenth year Miss Stephen Norman gave promise of striking\r\nbeauty; beauty of a rarely composite character.  In her the various\r\nelements of her race seemed to have cropped out.  The firm-set jaw, with\r\nchin broader and more square than is usual in a woman, and the wide fine\r\nforehead and aquiline nose marked the high descent from Saxon through\r\nNorman.  The glorious mass of red hair, of the true flame colour, showed\r\nthe blood of another ancient ancestor of Northern race, and suited well\r\nwith the voluptuous curves of the full, crimson lips.  The purple-black\r\neyes, the raven eyebrows and eyelashes, and the fine curve of the\r\nnostrils spoke of the Eastern blood of the far-back wife of the Crusader.\r\nAlready she was tall for her age, with something of that lankiness which\r\nmarks the early development of a really fine figure.  Long-legged, long-\r\nnecked, as straight as a lance, with head poised on the proud neck like a\r\nlily on its stem.\r\n\r\nStephen Norman certainly gave promise of a splendid womanhood.  Pride,\r\nself-reliance and dominance were marked in every feature; in her bearing\r\nand in her lightest movement.\r\n\r\nHer companion, Harold An Wolf, was some five years her senior, and by\r\nmeans of those five years and certain qualities had long stood in the\r\nposition of her mentor.  He was more than six feet two in height, deep-\r\nchested, broad-shouldered, lean-flanked, long-armed and big-handed.  He\r\nhad that appearance strength, with well-poised neck and forward set of\r\nthe head, which marks the successful athlete.\r\n\r\nThe two sat quiet, listening.  Through the quiet hum of afternoon came\r\nthe voices of the two children.  Outside the lich-gate, under the shade\r\nof the spreading cedar, the horses stamped occasionally as the flies\r\ntroubled them.  The grooms were mounted; one held the delicate-limbed\r\nwhite Arab, the other the great black horse.\r\n\r\n'I would rather be an angel than God!'\r\n\r\nThe little girl who made the remark was an ideal specimen of the village\r\nSunday-school child.  Blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked, thick-legged, with her\r\nstraight brown hair tied into a hard bunch with a much-creased, cherry-\r\ncoloured ribbon.  A glance at the girl would have satisfied the most\r\nsceptical as to her goodness.  Without being in any way smug she was\r\nradiant with self-satisfaction and well-doing.  A child of the people; an\r\nearly riser; a help to her mother; a good angel to her father; a little\r\nmother to her brothers and sisters; cleanly in mind and body;\r\nself-reliant, full of faith, cheerful.\r\n\r\nThe other little girl was prettier, but of a more stubborn type; more\r\npassionate, less organised, and infinitely more assertive.  Black-haired,\r\nblack-eyed, swarthy, large-mouthed, snub-nosed; the very type and essence\r\nof unrestrained, impulsive, emotional, sensual nature.  A seeing eye\r\nwould have noted inevitable danger for the early years of her womanhood.\r\nShe seemed amazed by the self-abnegation implied by her companion's\r\nstatement; after a pause she replied:\r\n\r\n'I wouldn't!  I'd rather be up at the top of everything and give orders\r\nto the angels if I chose.  I can't think, Marjorie, why you'd rather take\r\norders than give them.'\r\n\r\n'That's just it, Susan.  I don't want to give orders; I'd rather obey\r\nthem.  It must be very terrible to have to think of things so much, that\r\nyou want everything done your own way.  And besides, I shouldn't like to\r\nhave to be just!'\r\n\r\n'Why not?' the voice was truculent, though there was wistfulness in it\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n'Oh Susan.  Just fancy having to punish; for of course justice needs\r\npunishing as well as praising.  Now an angel has such a nice time,\r\nhelping people and comforting them, and bringing sunshine into dark\r\nplaces.  Putting down fresh dew every morning; making the flowers grow,\r\nand bringing babies and taking care of them till their mothers find them.\r\nOf course God is very good and very sweet and very merciful, but oh, He\r\nmust be very terrible.'\r\n\r\n'All the same I would rather be God and able to do things!'\r\n\r\nThen the children moved off out of earshot.  The two seated on the\r\ntombstone looked after them.  The first to speak was the girl, who said:\r\n\r\n'That's very sweet and good of Marjorie; but do you know, Harold, I like\r\nSusie's idea better.'\r\n\r\n'Which idea was that, Stephen?'\r\n\r\n'Why, didn't you notice what she said: \"I'd like to be God and be able to\r\ndo things\"?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he said after a moment's reflection.  'That's a fine idea in the\r\nabstract; but I doubt of its happiness in the long-run.'\r\n\r\n'Doubt of its happiness?  Come now? what could there be better, after\r\nall?  Isn't it good enough to be God?  What more do you want?'\r\n\r\nThe girl's tone was quizzical, but her great black eyes blazed with some\r\nthought of sincerity which lay behind the fun.  The young man shook his\r\nhead with a smile of kindly tolerance as he answered:\r\n\r\n'It isn't that--surely you must know it.  I'm ambitious enough, goodness\r\nknows; but there are bounds to satisfy even me.  But I'm not sure that\r\nthe good little thing isn't right.  She seemed, somehow, to hit a bigger\r\ntruth than she knew: \"fancy having to be just.\"'\r\n\r\n'I don't see much difficulty in that.  Anyone can be just!'\r\n\r\n'Pardon me,' he answered, 'there is perhaps nothing so difficult in the\r\nwhole range of a man's work.'  There was distinct defiance in the girl's\r\neyes as she asked:\r\n\r\n'A man's work!  Why a man's work?  Isn't it a woman's work also?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I suppose it ought to be, theoretically; practically it isn't.'\r\n\r\n'And why not, pray?'  The mere suggestion of any disability of woman as\r\nsuch aroused immediate antagonism.  Her companion suppressed a smile as\r\nhe answered deliberately:\r\n\r\n'Because, my dear Stephen, the Almighty has ordained that justice is not\r\na virtue women can practise.  Mind, I do not say women are unjust.  Far\r\nfrom it, where there are no interests of those dear to them they can be\r\nof a sincerity of justice that can make a man's blood run cold.  But\r\njustice in the abstract is not an ordinary virtue: it has to be\r\nconsiderate as well as stern, and above all interest of all kinds and of\r\nevery one--'  The girl interrupted hotly:\r\n\r\n'I don't agree with you at all.  You can't give an instance where women\r\nare unjust.  I don't mean of course individual instances, but classes of\r\ncases where injustice is habitual.'  The suppressed smile cropped out now\r\nunconsciously round the man's lips in a way which was intensely\r\naggravating to the girl.\r\n\r\n'I'll give you a few,' he said.  'Did you ever know a mother just to a\r\nboy who beat her own boy at school?'  The girl replied quietly:\r\n\r\n'Ill-treatment and bullying are subjects for punishment, not justice.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't mean that kind of beating.  I mean getting the prizes their\r\nown boys contended for; getting above them in class; showing superior\r\npowers in running or cricket or swimming, or in any of the forms of\r\neffort in which boys vie with each other.'  The girl reflected, then she\r\nspoke:\r\n\r\n'Well, you may be right.  I don't altogether admit it, but I accept it as\r\nnot on my side.  But this is only one case.'\r\n\r\n'A pretty common one.  Do you think that Sheriff of Galway, who in\r\ndefault of a hangman hanged his son with his own hands, would have done\r\nso if he had been a woman?'  The girl answered at once:\r\n\r\n'Frankly, no.  I don't suppose the mother was ever born who would do such\r\na thing.  But that is not a common case, is it?  Have you any other?'  The\r\nyoung man paused before he spoke:\r\n\r\n'There is another, but I don't think I can go into it fairly with you.'\r\n\r\n'Why not?'\r\n\r\n'Well, because after all you know, Stephen, you are only a girl and you\r\ncan't be expected to know.'  The girl laughed:\r\n\r\n'Well, if it's anything about women surely a girl, even of my tender age,\r\nmust know something more of it, or be able to guess at, than any young\r\nman can.  However, say what you think and I'll tell you frankly if I\r\nagree--that is if a woman can be just, in such a matter.'\r\n\r\n'Shortly the point is this: Can a woman be just to another woman, or to a\r\nman for the matter of that, where either her own affection or a fault of\r\nthe other is concerned?'\r\n\r\n'I don't see any reason to the contrary.  Surely pride alone should\r\nensure justice in the former case, and the consciousness of superiority\r\nin the other.'  The young man shook his head:\r\n\r\n'Pride and the consciousness of superiority!  Are they not much the same\r\nthing.  But whether or no, if either of them has to be relied on, I'm\r\nafraid the scales of Justice would want regulating, and her sword should\r\nbe blunted in case its edge should be turned back on herself.  I have an\r\nidea that although pride might be a guiding principle with you\r\nindividually, it would be a failure with the average.  However, as it\r\nwould be in any case a rule subject to many exceptions I must let it go.'\r\n\r\nHarold looked at his watch and rose.  Stephen followed him; transferring\r\nher whip into the hand which held up the skirt, she took his arm with her\r\nright hand in the pretty way in which a young girl clings to her elders.\r\nTogether they went out at the lich-gate.  The groom drew over with the\r\nhorses.  Stephen patted hers and gave her a lump of sugar.  Then putting\r\nher foot into Harold's ready hand she sprang lightly into the saddle.\r\nHarold swung himself into his saddle with the dexterity of an\r\naccomplished rider.\r\n\r\nAs the two rode up the road, keeping on the shady side under the trees,\r\nStephen said quietly, half to herself, as if the sentence had impressed\r\nitself on her mind:\r\n\r\n'To be God and able to do things!'\r\n\r\nHarold rode on in silence.  The chill of some vague fear was upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I--STEPHEN\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen Norman of Normanstand had remained a bachelor until close on\r\nmiddle age, when the fact took hold of him that there was no immediate\r\nheir to his great estate.  Whereupon, with his wonted decision, he set\r\nabout looking for a wife.\r\n\r\nHe had been a close friend of his next neighbour, Squire Rowly, ever\r\nsince their college days.  They had, of course, been often in each\r\nother's houses, and Rowly's young sister--almost a generation younger\r\nthan himself, and the sole fruit of his father's second marriage--had\r\nbeen like a little sister to him too.  She had, in the twenty years which\r\nhad elapsed, grown to be a sweet and beautiful young woman.  In all the\r\npast years, with the constant opportunity which friendship gave of close\r\ncompanionship, the feeling never altered.  Squire Norman would have been\r\nsurprised had he been asked to describe Margaret Rowly and found himself\r\ncompelled to present the picture of a woman, not a child.\r\n\r\nNow, however, when his thoughts went womanward and wifeward, he awoke to\r\nthe fact that Margaret came within the category of those he sought.  His\r\nusual decision ran its course.  Semi-brotherly feeling gave place to a\r\nstronger and perhaps more selfish feeling.  Before he even knew it, he\r\nwas head over ears in love with his pretty neighbour.\r\n\r\nNorman was a fine man, stalwart and handsome; his forty years sat so\r\nlightly on him that his age never seemed to come into question in a\r\nwoman's mind.  Margaret had always liked him and trusted him; he was the\r\nbig brother who had no duty in the way of scolding to do.  His presence\r\nhad always been a gladness; and the sex of the girl, first unconsciously\r\nthen consciously, answered to the man's overtures, and her consent was\r\nsoon obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen in the fulness of time it was known that an heir was expected,\r\nSquire Norman took for granted that the child would be a boy, and held\r\nthe idea so tenaciously that his wife, who loved him deeply, gave up\r\nwarning and remonstrance after she had once tried to caution him against\r\ntoo fond a hope.  She saw how bitterly he would be disappointed in case\r\nit should prove to be a girl.  He was, however, so fixed on the point\r\nthat she determined to say no more.  After all, it might be a boy; the\r\nchances were equal.  The Squire would not listen to any one else at all;\r\nso as the time went on his idea was more firmly fixed than ever.  His\r\narrangements were made on the base that he would have a son.  The name\r\nwas of course decided.  Stephen had been the name of all the Squires of\r\nNormanstand for ages--as far back as the records went; and Stephen the\r\nnew heir of course would be.\r\n\r\nLike all middle-aged men with young wives he was supremely anxious as the\r\ntime drew near.  In his anxiety for his wife his belief in the son became\r\npassive rather than active.  Indeed, the idea of a son was so deeply\r\nfixed in his mind that it was not disturbed even by his anxiety for the\r\nyoung wife he idolised.\r\n\r\nWhen instead of a son a daughter was born, the Doctor and the nurse, who\r\nknew his views on the subject, held back from the mother for a little the\r\nknowledge of the sex.  Dame Norman was so weak that the Doctor feared\r\nlest anxiety as to how her husband would bear the disappointment, might\r\nmilitate against her.  Therefore the Doctor sought the Squire in his\r\nstudy, and went resolutely at his task.\r\n\r\n'Well, Squire, I congratulate you on the birth of your child!'  Norman\r\nwas of course struck with the use of the word 'child'; but the cause of\r\nhis anxiety was manifested by his first question:\r\n\r\n'How is she, Doctor?  Is she safe?'  The child was after all of secondary\r\nimportance!  The Doctor breathed more freely; the question had lightened\r\nhis task.  There was, therefore, more assurance in his voice as he\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n'She is safely through the worst of her trouble, but I am greatly anxious\r\nyet.  She is very weak.  I fear anything that might upset her.'\r\n\r\nThe Squire's voice came quick and strong:\r\n\r\n'There must be no upset!  And now tell me about my son?'  He spoke the\r\nlast word half with pride, half bashfully.\r\n\r\n'Your son is a daughter!'  There was silence for so long that the Doctor\r\nbegan to be anxious.  Squire Norman sat quite still; his right hand\r\nresting on the writing-table before him became clenched so hard that the\r\nknuckles looked white and the veins red.  After a long slow breath he\r\nspoke:\r\n\r\n'She, my daughter, is well?'  The Doctor answered with cheerful alacrity:\r\n\r\n'Splendid!--I never saw a finer child in my life.  She will be a comfort\r\nand an honour to you!'  The Squire spoke again:\r\n\r\n'What does her mother think?  I suppose she's very proud of her?'\r\n\r\n'She does not know yet that it is a girl.  I thought it better not to let\r\nher know till I had told you.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'Because--because--Norman, old friend, you know why!  Because you had set\r\nyour heart on a son; and I know how it would grieve that sweet young wife\r\nand mother to feel your disappointment.  I want your lips to be the first\r\nto tell her; so that on may assure her of your happiness in that a\r\ndaughter has been born to you.'\r\n\r\nThe Squire put out his great hand and laid it on the other's shoulder.\r\nThere was almost a break in his voice as he said:\r\n\r\n'Thank you, my old friend, my true friend, for your thought.  When may I\r\nsee her?'\r\n\r\n'By right, not yet.  But, as knowing your views, she may fret herself\r\ntill she knows, I think you had better come at once.'\r\n\r\nAll Norman's love and strength combined for his task.  As he leant over\r\nand kissed his young wife there was real fervour in his voice as he said:\r\n\r\n'Where is my dear daughter that you may place her in my arms?'  For an\r\ninstant there came a chill to the mother's heart that her hopes had been\r\nso far disappointed; but then came the reaction of her joy that her\r\nhusband, her baby's father, was pleased.  There was a heavenly dawn of\r\nred on her pale face as she drew her husband's head down and kissed him.\r\n\r\n'Oh, my dear,' she said, 'I am so happy that you are pleased!'  The nurse\r\ntook the mother's hand gently and held it to the baby as she laid it in\r\nthe father's arms.\r\n\r\nHe held the mother's hand as he kissed the baby's brow.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor touched him gently on the arm and beckoned him away.  He went\r\nwith careful footsteps, looking behind as he went.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he talked with the Doctor on various matters; but presently\r\nhe asked:\r\n\r\n'I suppose, Doctor, it is no sort of rule that the first child regulates\r\nthe sex of a family?'\r\n\r\n'No, of course not.  Otherwise how should we see boys and girls mixed in\r\none family, as is nearly always the case.  But, my friend,' he went on,\r\n'you must not build hopes so far away.  I have to tell you that your wife\r\nis far from strong.  Even now she is not so well as I could wish, and\r\nthere yet may be change.'  The Squire leaped impetuously to his feet as\r\nhe spoke quickly:\r\n\r\n'Then why are we waiting here?  Can nothing be done?  Let us have the\r\nbest help, the best advice in the world.'  The Doctor raised his hand.\r\n\r\n'Nothing can be done as yet.  I have only fear.'\r\n\r\n'Then let us be ready in case your fears should be justified!  Who are\r\nthe best men in London to help in such a case?'  The Doctor mentioned two\r\nnames; and within a few minutes a mounted messenger was galloping to\r\nNorcester, the nearest telegraph centre.  The messenger was to arrange\r\nfor a special train if necessary.  Shortly afterwards the Doctor went\r\nagain to see his patient.  After a long absence he came back, pale and\r\nagitated.  Norman felt his heart sink when he saw him; a groan broke from\r\nhim as the Doctor spoke:\r\n\r\n'She is much worse!  I am in great fear that she may pass away before the\r\nmorning!'  The Squire's strong voice was clouded, with a hoarse veil as\r\nhe asked:\r\n\r\n'May I see her?'\r\n\r\n'Not yet; at present she is sleeping.  She may wake strengthened; in\r\nwhich case you may see her.  But if not--'\r\n\r\n'If not?'--the voice was not like his own.\r\n\r\n'Then I shall send for you at once!'  The Doctor returned to his vigil.\r\nThe Squire, left alone, sank on his knees, his face in his hands; his\r\ngreat shoulders shook with the intensity of his grief.\r\n\r\nAn hour or more passed before he heard hurried steps.  He sprang to the\r\ndoor:\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'You had better come now.'\r\n\r\n'Is she better?'\r\n\r\n'Alas! no.  I fear her minutes are numbered.  School yourself, my dear\r\nold friend!  God will help you in this bitter hour.  All you can do now\r\nis to make her last moments happy.'\r\n\r\n'I know!  I know!' he answered in a voice so calm that his companion\r\nwondered.\r\n\r\nWhen they came into the room Margaret was dozing.  When her eyes opened\r\nand she found her husband beside her bed there spread over her face a\r\nglad look; which, alas! soon changed to one of pain.  She motioned to him\r\nto bend down.  He knelt and put his head beside her on the pillow; his\r\narms went tenderly round her as though by his iron devotion and strength\r\nhe would shield her from all harm.  Her voice came very low and in broken\r\ngasps; she was summoning all her strength that she might speak:\r\n\r\n'My dear, dear husband, I am so sad at leaving you!  You have made me so\r\nhappy, and I love you so!  Forgive me, dear, for the pain I know you will\r\nsuffer when I am gone!  And oh, Stephen, I know you will cherish our\r\nlittle one--yours and mine--when I am gone.  She will have no mother; you\r\nwill have to be father and mother too.'\r\n\r\n'I will hold her in my very heart's core, my darling, as I hold you!'  He\r\ncould hardly speak from emotion.  She went on:\r\n\r\n'And oh, my dear, you will not grieve that she is not a son to carry on\r\nyour name?'  And then a sudden light came into her eyes; and there was\r\nexultation in her weak voice as she said:\r\n\r\n'She is to be our only one; let her be indeed our son!  Call her the name\r\nwe both love!'  For answer he rose and laid his hand very, very tenderly\r\non the babe as he said:\r\n\r\n'This dear one, my sweet wife, who will carry your soul in her breast,\r\nwill be my son; the only son I shall ever have.  All my life long I\r\nshall, please Almighty God, so love her--our little Stephen--as you and I\r\nlove each other!'\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand on his so that it touched at once her husband and her\r\nchild.  Then she raised the other weak arm, and placed it round his neck,\r\nand their lips met.  Her soul went out in this last kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II--THE HEART OF A CHILD\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some weeks after his wife's death Squire Norman was overwhelmed with\r\ngrief.  He made a brave effort, however, to go through the routine of his\r\nlife; and succeeded so far that he preserved an external appearance of\r\nbearing his loss with resignation.  But within, all was desolation.\r\n\r\nLittle Stephen had winning ways which sent deep roots into her father's\r\nheart.  The little bundle of nerves which the father took into his arms\r\nmust have realised with all its senses that, in all that it saw and heard\r\nand touched, there was nothing but love and help and protection.\r\nGradually the trust was followed by expectation.  If by some chance the\r\nfather was late in coming to the nursery the child would grow impatient\r\nand cast persistent, longing glances at the door.  When he came all was\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nTime went quickly by, and Norman was only recalled to its passing by the\r\ngrowth of his child.  Seedtime and harvest, the many comings of nature's\r\ngrowth were such commonplaces to him, and had been for so many years,\r\nthat they made on him no impressions of comparison.  But his baby was one\r\nand one only.  Any change in it was not only in itself a new experience,\r\nbut brought into juxtaposition what is with what was.  The changes that\r\nbegan to mark the divergence of sex were positive shocks to him, for they\r\nwere unexpected.  In the very dawn of babyhood dress had no special\r\nimport; to his masculine eyes sex was lost in youth.  But, little by\r\nlittle, came the tiny changes which convention has established.  And with\r\neach change came to Squire Norman the growing realisation that his child\r\nwas a woman.  A tiny woman, it is true, and requiring more care and\r\nprotection and devotion than a bigger one; but still a woman.  The pretty\r\nlittle ways, the eager caresses, the graspings and holdings of the\r\nchildish hands, the little roguish smiles and pantings and flirtings were\r\nall but repetitions in little of the dalliance of long ago.  The father,\r\nafter all, reads in the same book in which the lover found his knowledge.\r\n\r\nAt first there was through all his love for his child a certain\r\nresentment of her sex.  His old hope of a son had been rooted too deeply\r\nto give way easily.  But when the conviction came, and with it the habit\r\nof its acknowledgment, there came also a certain resignation, which is\r\nthe halting-place for satisfaction.  But he never, not then nor\r\nafterwards, quite lost the old belief that Stephen was indeed a son.\r\nCould there ever have been a doubt, the remembrance of his wife's eyes\r\nand of her faint voice, of her hope and her faith, as she placed her baby\r\nin his arms would have refused it a resting-place.  This belief tinged\r\nall his after-life and moulded his policy with regard to his girl's\r\nupbringing.  If she was to be indeed his son as well as his daughter, she\r\nmust from the first be accustomed to boyish as well as to girlish ways.\r\nThis, in that she was an only child, was not a difficult matter to\r\naccomplish.  Had she had brothers and sisters, matters of her sex would\r\nsoon have found their own level.\r\n\r\nThere was one person who objected strongly to any deviation from the\r\nconventional rule of a girl's education.  This was Miss Laetitia Rowly,\r\nwho took after a time, in so far as such a place could be taken, that of\r\nthe child's mother.  Laetitia Rowly was a young aunt of Squire Rowly of\r\nNorwood; the younger sister of his father and some sixteen years his own\r\nsenior.  When the old Squire's second wife had died, Laetitia, then a\r\nconceded spinster of thirty-six, had taken possession of the young\r\nMargaret.  When Margaret had married Squire Norman, Miss Rowly was well\r\nsatisfied; for she had known Stephen Norman all her life.  Though she\r\ncould have wished a younger bridegroom for her darling, she knew it would\r\nbe hard to get a better man or one of more suitable station in life.  Also\r\nshe knew that Margaret loved him, and the woman who had never found the\r\nhappiness of mutual love in her own life found a pleasure in the romance\r\nof true love, even when the wooer was middle-aged.  She had been\r\ntravelling in the Far East when the belated news of Margaret's death came\r\nto her.  When she had arrived home she announced her intention of taking\r\ncare of Margaret's child, just as she had taken care of Margaret.  For\r\nseveral reasons this could not be done in the same way.  She was not old\r\nenough to go and live at Normanstand without exciting comment; and the\r\nSquire absolutely refused to allow that his daughter should live anywhere\r\nexcept in his own house.  Educational supervision, exercised at such\r\ndistance and so intermittently, could neither be complete nor exact.\r\n\r\nThough Stephen was a sweet child she was a wilful one, and very early in\r\nlife manifested a dominant nature.  This was a secret pleasure to her\r\nfather, who, never losing sight of his old idea that she was both son and\r\ndaughter, took pleasure as well as pride out of each manifestation of her\r\nimperial will.  The keen instinct of childhood, which reasons in feminine\r\nfashion, and is therefore doubly effective in a woman-child, early\r\ngrasped the possibilities of her own will.  She learned the measure of\r\nher nurse's foot and then of her father's; and so, knowing where lay the\r\nbounds of possibility of the achievement of her wishes, she at once\r\navoided trouble and learned how to make the most of the space within the\r\nlimit of her tether.\r\n\r\nIt is not those who 'cry for the Moon' who go furthest or get most in\r\nthis limited world of ours.  Stephen's pretty ways and unfailing good\r\ntemper were a perpetual joy to her father; and when he found that as a\r\nrule her desires were reasonable, his wish to yield to them became a\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nMiss Rowly seldom saw any individual thing to disapprove of.  She it was\r\nwho selected the governesses and who interviewed them from time to time\r\nas to the child's progress.  Not often was there any complaint, for the\r\nlittle thing had such a pretty way of showing affection, and such a\r\nmanifest sense of justified trust in all whom she encountered, that it\r\nwould have been hard to name a specific fault.\r\n\r\nBut though all went in tears of affectionate regret, and with eminently\r\nsatisfactory emoluments and references, there came an irregularly timed\r\nsuccession of governesses.\r\n\r\nStephen's affection for her 'Auntie' was never affected by any of the\r\nchanges.  Others might come and go, but there no change came.  The\r\nchild's little hand would steal into one of the old lady's strong ones,\r\nor would clasp a finger and hold it tight.  And then the woman who had\r\nnever had a child of her own would feel, afresh each time, as though the\r\nchild's hand was gripping her heart.\r\n\r\nWith her father she was sweetest of all.  And as he seemed to be pleased\r\nwhen she did anything like a little boy, the habit of being like one\r\ninsensibly grew on her.\r\n\r\nAn only child has certain educational difficulties.  The true learning is\r\nnot that which we are taught, but that which we take in for ourselves\r\nfrom experience and observation, and children's experiences and\r\nobservation, especially of things other than repressive, are mainly of\r\nchildren.  The little ones teach each other.  Brothers and sisters are\r\nmore with each other than are ordinary playmates, and in the familiarity\r\nof their constant intercourse some of the great lessons, so useful in\r\nafter-life, are learned.  Little Stephen had no means of learning the\r\nwisdom of give-and-take.  To her everything was given, given bountifully\r\nand gracefully.  Graceful acceptance of good things came to her\r\nnaturally, as it does to one who is born to be a great lady.  The\r\nchildren of the farmers in the neighbourhood, with whom at times she\r\nplayed, were in such habitual awe of the great house, that they were\r\nseldom sufficiently at ease to play naturally.  Children cannot be on\r\nequal terms on special occasions with a person to whom they have been\r\ntaught to bow or courtesy as a public habit.  The children of\r\nneighbouring landowners, who were few and far between, and of the\r\nprofessional people in Norcester, were at such times as Stephen met them,\r\ngenerally so much on their good behaviour, that the spontaneity of play,\r\nthrough which it is that sharp corners of individuality are knocked off\r\nor worn down, did not exist.\r\n\r\nAnd so Stephen learned to read in the Book of Life; though only on one\r\nside of it.  At the age of six she had, though surrounded with loving\r\ncare and instructed by skilled teachers, learned only the accepting side\r\nof life.  Giving of course there was in plenty, for the traditions of\r\nNormanstand were royally benevolent; many a blessing followed the little\r\nmaid's footsteps as she accompanied some timely aid to the sick and needy\r\nsent from the Squire's house.  Moreover, her Aunt tried to inculcate\r\ncertain maxims founded on that noble one that it is more blessed to give\r\nthan to receive.  But of giving in its true sense: the giving that which\r\nwe want for ourselves, the giving that is as a temple built on the rock\r\nof self-sacrifice, she knew nothing.  Her sweet and spontaneous nature,\r\nwhich gave its love and sympathy so readily, was almost a bar to\r\neducation: it blinded the eyes that would have otherwise seen any defect\r\nthat wanted altering, any evil trait that needed repression, any lagging\r\nvirtue that required encouragement--or the spur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III--HAROLD\r\n\r\n\r\nSquire Norman had a clerical friend whose rectory of Carstone lay some\r\nthirty miles from Normanstand.  Thirty miles is not a great distance for\r\nrailway travel; but it is a long drive.  The days had not come, nor were\r\nthey ever likely to come, for the making of a railway between the two\r\nplaces.  For a good many years the two men had met in renewal of their\r\nold University days.  Squire Norman and Dr. An Wolf had been chums at\r\nTrinity, Cambridge, and the boyish friendship had ripened and lasted.\r\nWhen Harold An Wolf had put in his novitiate in a teeming Midland\r\nmanufacturing town, it was Norman's influence which obtained the\r\nrectorship for his friend.  It was not often that they could meet, for An\r\nWolf's work, which, though not very exacting, had to be done\r\nsingle-handed, kept him to his post.  Besides, he was a good scholar and\r\neked out a small income by preparing a few pupils for public school.  An\r\noccasional mid-week visit to Normanstand in the slack time of school work\r\non the Doctor's part, and now and again a drive by Norman over to the\r\nrectory, returning the next day, had been for a good many years the\r\nmeasure of their meeting.  Then An Wolf's marriage and the birth of a son\r\nhad kept him closer to home.  Mrs. An Wolf had been killed in a railway\r\naccident a couple of years after her only child had been born; and at the\r\ntime Norman had gone over to render any assistance in his power to the\r\nafflicted man, and to give him what was under the circumstances his best\r\ngift, sympathy.  After an interval of a few years the Squire's courtship\r\nand marriage, at which his old friend had assisted, had confined his\r\nactivities to a narrower circle.  The last time they had met was when An\r\nWolf had come over to Norcester to aid in the burial of his friend's\r\nwife.  In the process of years, however, the shadow over Norman's life\r\nhad begun to soften; when his baby had grown to be something of a\r\ncompanion, they met again.  Norman, 'who had never since his wife's death\r\nbeen able to tear himself, even for a night, away from Normanstand and\r\nStephen, wrote to his old friend asking him to come to him.  An Wolf\r\ngladly promised, and for a week of growing expectation the Squire looked\r\nforward to their meeting.  Each found the other somewhat changed, in all\r\nbut their old affection.\r\n\r\nAn Wolf was delighted with the little Stephen.  Her dainty beauty seemed\r\nto charm him; and the child, seeming to realise what pleasure she was\r\ngiving, exercised all her little winning ways.  The rector, who knew more\r\nof children than did his, friend, told her as she sat on his knee of a\r\nvery interesting person: his own son.  The child listened, interested at\r\nfirst, then enraptured.  She asked all kinds of questions; and the\r\nfather's eyes brightened as he gladly answered the pretty sympathetic\r\nchild, already deep in his heart for her father's sake.  He told her\r\nabout the boy who was so big and strong, and who could run and leap and\r\nswim and play cricket and football better than any other boy with whom he\r\nplayed.  When, warmed himself by the keen interest of the little girl,\r\nand seeing her beautiful black eyes beginning to glow, he too woke to the\r\nglory of the time; and all the treasured moments of the father's lonely\r\nheart gave out their store.  And the other father, thrilled with delight\r\nbecause of his baby's joy with, underlying all, an added pleasure that\r\nthe little Stephen's interest was in sports that were for boys, looked on\r\napprovingly, now and again asking questions himself in furtherance of the\r\nchild's wishes.\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon they sat in the garden, close to the stream that came\r\nout of the rock, and An Wolf told father's tales of his only son.  Of the\r\ngreat cricket match with Castra Puerorum when he had made a hundred not\r\nout.  Of the school races when he had won so many prizes.  Of the\r\nswimming match in the Islam River when, after he had won the race and had\r\ndressed himself, he went into the water in his clothes to help some\r\nchildren who had upset a boat.  How when Widow Norton's only son could\r\nnot be found, he dived into the deep hole of the intake of the milldam of\r\nthe great Carstone mills where Wingate the farrier had been drowned.  And\r\nhow, after diving twice without success, he had insisted on going down\r\nthe third time though people had tried to hold him back; and how he had\r\nbrought up in his arms the child all white and so near death that they\r\nhad to put him in the ashes of the baker's oven before he could be\r\nbrought back to life.\r\n\r\nWhen her nurse came to take her to bed, she slid down from her father's\r\nknee and coming over to Dr. An Wolf, gravely held out her hand and said:\r\n'Good-bye!'  Then she kissed him and said:\r\n\r\n'Thank you so much, Mr. Harold's daddy.  Won't you come soon again, and\r\ntell us more?'  Then she jumped again upon her father's knee and hugged\r\nhim round the neck and kissed him, and whispered in his ear:\r\n\r\n'Daddy, please make Mr. Harold's daddy when he comes again, bring Harold\r\nwith him!'\r\n\r\nAfter all it is natural for women to put the essence of the letter in the\r\npostscript!\r\n\r\nTwo weeks afterwards Dr. An Wolf came again and brought Harold with him.\r\nThe time had gone heavily with little Stephen when she knew that Harold\r\nwas coming with his father.  Stephen had been all afire to see the big\r\nboy whose feats had so much interested her, and for a whole week had\r\nflooded Mrs. Jarrold with questions which she was unable to answer.  At\r\nlast the time came and she went out to the hall door with her father to\r\nwelcome the guests.  At the top of the great granite steps, down which in\r\ntime of bad weather the white awning ran, she stood holding her father's\r\nhand and waving a welcome.\r\n\r\n'Good morning, Harold!  Good morning, Mr. Harold's daddy!'\r\n\r\nThe meeting was a great pleasure to both the children, and resulted in an\r\nimmediate friendship.  The small girl at once conceived a great\r\nadmiration for the big, strong boy nearly twice her age and more than\r\ntwice her size.  At her time of life the convenances are not, and love is\r\na thing to be spoken out at once and in the open.  Mrs. Jarrold, from the\r\nmoment she set eyes on him, liked the big kindly-faced boy who treated\r\nher like a lady, and who stood awkwardly blushing and silent in the\r\nmiddle of the nursery listening to the tiny child's proffers of\r\naffection.  For whatever kind of love it is that boys are capable of,\r\nHarold had fallen into it.  'Calf-love' is a thing habitually treated\r\nwith contempt.  It may be ridiculous; but all the same it is a serious\r\nreality--to the calf.\r\n\r\nHarold's new-found affection was as deep as his nature.  An only child\r\nwho had in his memory nothing of a mother's love, his naturally\r\naffectionate nature had in his childish days found no means of\r\nexpression.  A man child can hardly pour out his full heart to a man,\r\neven a father or a comrade; and this child had not, in a way, the\r\nconsolations of other children.  His father's secondary occupation of\r\nteaching brought other boys to the house and necessitated a domestic\r\nroutine which had to be exact.  There was no place for little girls in a\r\nboys' school; and though many of Dr. An Wolf's friends who were mothers\r\nmade much of the pretty, quiet boy, and took him to play with their\r\nchildren, he never seemed to get really intimate with them.  The equality\r\nof companionship was wanting.  Boys he knew, and with them he could hold\r\nhis own and yet be on affectionate terms.  But girls were strange to him,\r\nand in their presence he was shy.  With this lack of understanding of the\r\nother sex, grew up a sort of awe of it.  His opportunities of this kind\r\nof study were so few that the view never could become rectified.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that from his boyhood up to his twelfth year, Harold's\r\nknowledge of girlhood never increased nor did his awe diminish.  When his\r\nfather had told him all about his visit to Normanstand and of the\r\ninvitation which had been extended to him there came first awe, then\r\ndoubt, then expectation.  Between Harold and his father there was love\r\nand trust and sympathy.   The father's married love so soon cut short\r\nfound expression towards his child; and between them there had never been\r\neven the shadow of a cloud.  When his father told him how pretty the\r\nlittle Stephen was, how dainty, how sweet, he began to picture her in his\r\nmind's eye and to be bashfully excited over meeting her.\r\n\r\nHis first glimpse of Stephen was, he felt, one that he never could\r\nforget.  She had made up her mind that she would let Harold see what she\r\ncould do.  Harold could fly kites and swim and play cricket; she could\r\nnot do any of these, but she could ride.  Harold should see her pony, and\r\nsee her riding him all by herself.  And there would be another pony for\r\nHarold, a big, big, big one--she had spoken about its size herself to\r\nTopham, the stud-groom.  She had coaxed her daddy into promising that\r\nafter lunch she should take Harold riding.  To this end she had made\r\nready early.  She had insisted on putting on the red riding habit which\r\nDaddy had given her for her birthday, and now she stood on the top of the\r\nsteps all glorious in hunting pink, with the habit held over her arms,\r\nwith the tiny hunting-hoots all shiny underneath.  She had no hat on, and\r\nher beautiful hair of golden red shone in its glory.  But even it was\r\nalmost outshone by the joyous flush on her cheeks as she stood waving the\r\nlittle hand that did not hold Daddy's.  She was certainly a picture to\r\ndream of!  Her father's eyes lost nothing of her dainty beauty.  He was\r\nso proud of her that he almost forgot to wish that she had been a boy.\r\nThe pleasure he felt in her appearance was increased by the fact that her\r\ndress was his own idea.\r\n\r\nDuring luncheon Stephen was fairly silent; she usually chattered all\r\nthrough as freely as a bird sings.  Stephen was silent because the\r\noccasion was important.  Besides, Daddy wasn't all alone, and therefore\r\nhad not to be cheered up.  Also--this in postscript form--Harold was\r\nsilent!  In her present frame of mind Harold could do no wrong, and what\r\nHarold did was right.  She was unconsciously learning already a lesson\r\nfrom his presence.\r\n\r\nThat evening when going to bed she came to say good-night to Daddy.  After\r\nshe had kissed him she also kissed 'old Mr. Harold,' as she now called\r\nhim, and as a matter of course kissed Harold also.  He coloured up at\r\nonce.  It was the first time a girl had ever kissed him.\r\n\r\nThe next day from early morning until bed-time was one long joy to\r\nStephen, and there were few things of interest that Harold had not been\r\nshown; there were few of the little secrets which had not been shared\r\nwith him as they went about hand in hand.  Like all manly boys Harold was\r\ngood to little children and patient with them.  He was content to follow\r\nStephen about and obey all her behests.  He had fallen in love with her\r\nto the very bottom of his boyish heart.\r\n\r\nWhen the guests were going, Stephen stood with her father on the steps to\r\nsee them off.  When the carriage had swept behind the farthest point in\r\nthe long avenue, and when Harold's cap waving from the window could no\r\nlonger be seen, Squire Norman turned to go in, but paused in obedience to\r\nthe unconscious restraint of Stephen's hand.  He waited patiently till\r\nwith a long sigh she turned to him and they went in together.\r\n\r\nThat night before she went to bed Stephen came and sat on her father's\r\nknee, and after sundry pattings and kissings whispered in his ear:\r\n\r\n'Daddy, wouldn't it be nice if Harold could come here altogether?\r\nCouldn't you ask him to?  And old Mr. Harold could come too.  Oh, I wish\r\nhe was here!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV--HAROLD AT NORMANSTAND\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years afterwards a great blow fell upon Harold.  His father, who had\r\nbeen suffering from repeated attacks of influenza, was, when in the low\r\ncondition following this, seized with pneumonia, to which in a few days\r\nhe succumbed.  Harold was heart-broken.  The affection which had been\r\nbetween him and his father had been so consistent that he had never known\r\na time when it was not.\r\n\r\nWhen Squire Norman had returned to the house with him after the funeral,\r\nhe sat in silence holding the boy's hand till he had wept his heart out.\r\nBy this time the two were old friends, and the boy was not afraid or too\r\nshy to break down before him.  There was sufficient of the love of the\r\nold generation to begin with trust in the new.\r\n\r\nPresently, when the storm was past and Harold had become his own man\r\nagain, Norman said:\r\n\r\n'And now, Harold, I want you to listen to me.  You know, my dear boy,\r\nthat I am your father's oldest friend, and right sure I am that he would\r\napprove of what I say.  You must come home with me to live.  I know that\r\nin his last hours the great concern of your dear father's heart would\r\nhave been for the future of his boy.  And I know, too, that it was a\r\ncomfort to him to feel that you and I are such friends, and that the son\r\nof my dearest old friend would be as a son to me.  We have been friends,\r\nyou and I, a long time, Harold; and we have learned to trust, and I hope\r\nto love, one another.  And you and my little Stephen are such friends\r\nalready that your coming into the house will be a joy to us all.  Why,\r\nlong ago, when first you came, she said to me the night you went away:\r\n\"Daddy, wouldn't it be nice if Harold could come here altogether?\"'\r\n\r\nAnd so Harold An Wolf came back with the Squire to Normanstand, and from\r\nthat day on became a member of his house, and as a son to him.  Stephen's\r\ndelight at his coming was of course largely qualified by her sympathy\r\nwith his grief; but it would have been hard to give him more comfort than\r\nshe did in her own pretty way.  Putting her lips to his she kissed him,\r\nand holding his big hand in both of her little ones, she whispered\r\nsoftly:\r\n\r\n'Poor Harold!  You and I should love each other, for we have both lost\r\nour mother.  And now you have lost your father.  But you must let my dear\r\ndaddy be yours too!'\r\n\r\nAt this time Harold was between fourteen and fifteen years old.  He was\r\nwell educated in so far as private teaching went.  His father had devoted\r\nmuch care to him, so that he was well grounded in all the Academic\r\nbranches of learning.  He was also, for his years, an expert in most\r\nmanly exercises.  He could ride anything, shoot straight, fence, run,\r\njump or swim with any boy more than his age and size.\r\n\r\nIn Normanstand his education was continued by the rector.  The Squire\r\nused often to take him with him when he went to ride, or fish, or shoot;\r\nfrankly telling him that as his daughter was, as yet, too young to be his\r\ncompanion in these matters, he would act as her locum tenens.  His living\r\nin the house and his helping as he did in Stephen's studies made\r\nfamiliarity perpetual.  He was just enough her senior to command her\r\nchildish obedience; and there were certain qualities in his nature which\r\nwere eminently calculated to win and keep the respect of women as well as\r\nof men.  He was the very incarnation of sincerity, and had now and again,\r\nin certain ways, a sublime self-negation which, at times, seemed in\r\nstartling contrast to a manifestly militant nature.  When at school he\r\nhad often been involved in fights which were nearly always on matters of\r\nprinciple, and by a sort of unconscious chivalry he was generally found\r\nfighting on the weaker side.  Harold's father had been very proud of his\r\nancestry, which was Gothic through the Dutch, as the manifestly corrupted\r\nprefix of the original name implied, and he had gathered from a constant\r\nstudy of the Sagas something of the philosophy which lay behind the ideas\r\nof the Vikings.\r\n\r\nThis new stage of Harold's life made for quicker development than any\r\nwhich had gone before.  Hitherto he had not the same sense of\r\nresponsibility.  To obey is in itself a relief; and as it is an actual\r\nconsolation to weak natures, so it is only a retarding of the strong.  Now\r\nhe had another individuality to think of.  There was in his own nature a\r\nvein of anxiety of which the subconsciousness of his own strength threw\r\nup the outcrop.\r\n\r\nLittle Stephen with the instinct of her sex discovered before long this\r\nweakness.  For it is a weakness when any quality can be assailed or used.\r\nThe using of a man's weakness is not always coquetry; but it is something\r\nvery like it.  Many a time the little girl, who looked up to and admired\r\nthe big boy who could compel her to anything when he was so minded,\r\nwould, for her own ends, work on his sense of responsibility, taking an\r\nelfin delight in his discomfiture.\r\n\r\nThe result of Stephen's harmless little coquetries was that Harold had\r\noccasionally either to thwart some little plan of daring, or else cover\r\nup its results.  In either case her confidence in him grew, so that\r\nbefore long he became an established fact in her life, a being in whose\r\npower and discretion and loyalty she had absolute, blind faith.  And this\r\nfeeling seemed to grow with her own growth.  Indeed at one time it came\r\nto be more than an ordinary faith.  It happened thus:\r\n\r\nThe old Church of St. Stephen, which was the parish church of\r\nNormanstand, had a peculiar interest for the Norman family.  There,\r\neither within the existing walls or those which had preceded them when\r\nthe church was rebuilt by that Sir Stephen who was standard-bearer to\r\nHenry VI., were buried all the direct members of the line.  It was an\r\nunbroken record of the inheritors since the first Sir Stephen, who had\r\nhis place in the Domesday Book.  Without, in the churchyard close to the\r\nchurch, were buried all such of the collaterals as had died within hail\r\nof Norcester.  Some there were of course who, having achieved distinction\r\nin various walks of life, were further honoured by a resting-place within\r\nthe chancel.  The whole interior was full of records of the family.\r\nSquire Norman was fond of coming to the place; and often from the very\r\nbeginning had taken Stephen with him.  One of her earliest recollections\r\nwas kneeling down with her father, who held her hand in his, whilst with\r\nthe other he wiped the tears from his eyes, before a tomb sculptured\r\nbeautifully in snowy marble.  She never forgot the words he had said to\r\nher:\r\n\r\n'You will always remember, darling, that your dear mother rests in this\r\nsacred place.  When I am gone, if you are ever in any trouble come here.\r\nCome alone and open out your heart.  You need never fear to ask God for\r\nhelp at the grave of your mother!'  The child had been impressed, as had\r\nbeen many and many another of her race.  For seven hundred years each\r\nchild of the house of Norman had been brought alone by either parent and\r\nhad heard some such words.  The custom had come to be almost a family\r\nritual, and it never failed to leave its impress in greater or lesser\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nWhenever Harold had in the early days paid a visit to Normanstand, the\r\nchurch had generally been an objective of their excursions.  He was\r\nalways delighted to go.  His love for his own ancestry made him admire\r\nand respect that of others; so that Stephen's enthusiasm in the matter\r\nwas but another cord to bind him to her.\r\n\r\nIn one of their excursions they found the door into the crypt open; and\r\nnothing would do Stephen but that they should enter it.  To-day, however,\r\nthey had no light; but they arranged that on the morrow they would bring\r\ncandles with them and explore the place thoroughly.  The afternoon of the\r\nnext day saw them at the door of the crypt with a candle, which Harold\r\nproceeded to light.  Stephen looked on admiringly, and said in a half-\r\nconscious way, the half-consciousness being shown in the implication:\r\n\r\n'You are not afraid of the crypt?'\r\n\r\n'Not a bit!  In my father's church there was a crypt, and I was in it\r\nseveral times.'  As he spoke the memory of the last time he had been\r\nthere swept over him.  He seemed to see again the many lights, held in\r\nhands that were never still, making a grim gloom where the black shadows\r\nwere not; to hear again the stamp and hurried shuffle of the many feet,\r\nas the great oak coffin was borne by the struggling mass of men down the\r\nsteep stairway and in through the narrow door . . . And then the hush\r\nwhen voices faded away; and the silence seemed a real thing, as for a\r\nwhile he stood alone close to the dead father who had been all in all to\r\nhim.  And once again he seemed to feel the recall to the living world of\r\nsorrow and of light, when his inert hand was taken in the strong loving\r\none of Squire Norman.\r\n\r\nHe paused and drew back.\r\n\r\n'Why don't you go on?' she asked, surprised.\r\n\r\nHe did not like to tell her then.  Somehow, it seemed out of place.  He\r\nhad often spoken to her of his father, and she had always been a\r\nsympathetic listener; but here, at the entrance of the grim vault, he did\r\nnot wish to pain her with his own thoughts of sorrow and all the terrible\r\nmemories which the similarity of the place evoked.  And even whilst he\r\nhesitated there came to him a thought so laden with pain and fear that he\r\nrejoiced at the pause which gave it to him in time.  It was in that very\r\ncrypt that Stephen's mother had been buried, and had they two gone in, as\r\nthey had intended, the girl might have seen her mother's coffin as he had\r\nseen his father's, but under circumstances which made him shiver.  He had\r\nbeen, as he said, often in the crypt at Carstone; and well he knew the\r\nsordidness of the chamber of death.  His imagination was alive as well as\r\nhis memory; he shuddered, not for himself, but for Stephen.  How could he\r\nallow the girl to suffer in such a way as she might, as she infallibly\r\nwould, if it were made apparent to her in such a brutal way?  How\r\npitiful, how meanly pitiful, is the aftermath of death.  Well he\r\nremembered how many a night he woke in an agony, thinking of how his\r\nfather lay in that cold, silent, dust-strewn vault, in the silence and\r\nthe dark, with never a ray of light or hope or love!  Gone, abandoned,\r\nforgotten by all, save perhaps one heart which bled . . . He would save\r\nlittle Stephen, if he could, from such a memory.  He would not give any\r\nreason for refusing to go in.\r\n\r\nHe blew out the candle, and turned the key in the lock, took it out, and\r\nput it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n'Come, Stephen!' he said, 'let us go somewhere else.  We will not go into\r\nthe crypt to-day!'\r\n\r\n'Why not?'  The lips that spoke were pouted mutinously and the face was\r\nflushed.  The imperious little lady was not at all satisfied to give up\r\nthe cherished project.  For a whole day and night she had, whilst waking,\r\nthought of the coming adventure; the thrill of it was not now to be\r\nturned to cold disappointment without even an explanation.  She did not\r\nthink that Harold was afraid; that would be ridiculous.  But she\r\nwondered; and mysteries always annoyed her.  She did not like to be at\r\nfault, more especially when other people knew.  All the pride in her\r\nrevolted.\r\n\r\n'Why not?' she repeated more imperiously still.\r\n\r\nHarold said kindly:\r\n\r\n'Because, Stephen, there is really a good reason.  Don't ask me, for I\r\ncan't tell you.  You must take it from me that I am right.  You know,\r\ndear, that I wouldn't willingly disappoint you; and I know that you had\r\nset your heart on this.  But indeed, indeed I have a good reason.'\r\n\r\nStephen was really angry now.  She was amenable to reason, though she did\r\nnot consciously know what reason was; but to accept some one else's\r\nreason blindfold was repugnant to her nature, even at her then age.  She\r\nwas about to speak angrily, but looking up she saw that Harold's mouth\r\nwas set with marble firmness.  So, after her manner, she acquiesced in\r\nthe inevitable and said:\r\n\r\n'All right!  Harold.'\r\n\r\nBut in the inner recesses of her firm-set mind was a distinct intention\r\nto visit the vault when more favourable circumstances would permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V--THE CRYPT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was some weeks before Stephen got the chance she wanted.  She knew it\r\nwould be difficult to evade Harold's observation, for the big boy's\r\nacuteness as to facts had impressed itself on her.  It was strange that\r\nout of her very trust in Harold came a form of distrust in others.  In\r\nthe little matter of evading him she inclined to any one in whom there\r\nwas his opposite, in whose reliability she instinctively mistrusted.\r\n'There is nothing bad or good but thinking makes it so!'  To enter that\r\ncrypt, which had seemed so small a matter at first, had now in process of\r\nthinking and wishing and scheming become a thing to be much desired.\r\nHarold saw, or rather felt, that something was in the girl's mind, and\r\ntook for granted that it had something to do with the crypt.  But he\r\nthought it better not to say anything lest he should keep awake a desire\r\nwhich he hoped would die naturally.\r\n\r\nOne day it was arranged that Harold should go over to Carstone to see the\r\nsolicitor who had wound up his father's business.  He was to stay the\r\nnight and ride back next day.  Stephen, on hearing of the arrangement, so\r\ncontrived matters that Master Everard, the son of a banker who had\r\nrecently purchased an estate in the neighbourhood, was asked to come to\r\nplay with her on the day when Harold left.  It was holiday time at Eton,\r\nand he was at home.  Stephen did not mention to Harold the fact of his\r\ncoming; it was only from a chance allusion of Mrs. Jarrold before he went\r\nthat he inferred it.  He did not think the matter of sufficient\r\nimportance to wonder why Stephen, who generally told him everything, had\r\nnot mentioned this.\r\n\r\nDuring their play, Stephen, after pledging him to secrecy, told Leonard\r\nof her intention of visiting the crypt, and asked him to help her in it.\r\nThis was an adventure, and as such commended itself to the schoolboy\r\nheart.  He entered at once into the scheme con amore; and the two\r\ndiscussed ways and means.  Leonard's only regret was that he was\r\nassociated with a little girl in such a project.  It was something of a\r\nblow to his personal vanity, which was a large item in his moral\r\nequipment, that such a project should have been initiated by the girl and\r\nnot by himself.  He was to get possession of the key and in the forenoon\r\nof the next day he was to be waiting in the churchyard, when Stephen\r\nwould join him as soon as she could evade her nurse.  She was now more\r\nthan eleven, and had less need of being watched than in her earlier\r\nyears.  It was possible, with strategy, to get away undiscovered for an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAt Carstone Harold got though what he had to do that same afternoon and\r\narranged to start early in the morning for Normanstand.  After an early\r\nbreakfast he set out on his thirty-mile journey at eight o'clock.\r\nLittlejohn, his horse, was in excellent form, notwithstanding his long\r\njourney of the day before, and with his nose pointed for home, put his\r\nbest foot foremost.  Harold felt in great spirits.  The long ride the day\r\nbefore had braced him physically, though there were on his journey times\r\nof great sadness when the thought of his father came back to him and the\r\nsense of loss was renewed with each thought of his old home.  But youth\r\nis naturally buoyant.  His visit to the church, the first thing on his\r\narrival at Carstone, and his kneeling before the stone made sacred to his\r\nfather's memory, though it entailed a silent gush of tears, did him good,\r\nand even seemed to place his sorrow farther away.  When he came again in\r\nthe morning before leaving Carstone there were no tears.  There was only\r\na holy memory which seemed to sanctify loss; and his father seemed nearer\r\nto him than ever.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near Normanstand he looked forward eagerly to seeing Stephen,\r\nand the sight of the old church lying far below him as he came down the\r\nsteep road over Alt Hill, which was the short-cut from Norcester, set his\r\nmind working.  His visit to the tomb of his own father made him think of\r\nthe day when he kept Stephen from entering the crypt.\r\n\r\nThe keenest thought is not always conscious.  It was without definite\r\nintention that when he came to the bridle-path Harold turned his horse's\r\nhead and rode down to the churchyard.  As he pushed open the door of the\r\nchurch he half expected to see Stephen; and there was a vague possibility\r\nthat Leonard Everard might be with her.\r\n\r\nThe church was cool and dim.  Coming from the hot glare the August\r\nsunshine it seemed, at the first glance, dark.  He looked around, and a\r\nsense of relief came over him.  The place was empty.\r\n\r\nBut even as he stood, there came a sound which made his heart grow cold.\r\nA cry, muffled, far away and full of anguish; a sobbing cry, which\r\nsuddenly ceased.\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of Stephen.  He instinctively knew where it came from;\r\nthe crypt.  Only for the experience he had had of her desire to enter the\r\nplace, he would never have suspected that it was so close to him.  He ran\r\ntowards the corner where commenced the steps leading downward.  As he\r\nreached the spot a figure came rushing up the steps.  A boy in Eton\r\njacket and wide collar, careless, pale, and agitated.  It was Leonard\r\nEverard.  Harold seized him as he came.\r\n\r\n'Where is Stephen?' he cried in a quick, low voice.\r\n\r\n'In the vault below there.  She dropped her light and then took mine, and\r\nshe dropped it too.  Let me go!  Let me go!'  He struggled to get away;\r\nbut Harold held him tight.\r\n\r\n'Where are the matches?'\r\n\r\n'In my pocket.  Let me go!  Let me go!'\r\n\r\n'Give me them--this instant!'  He was examining the frightened boy's\r\nwaistcoat pockets as he spoke.  When he had got the matches he let the\r\nboy go, and ran down the steps and through the open door into the crypt,\r\ncalling out as he came:\r\n\r\n'Stephen!  Stephen dear, where are you?  It is I--Harold!'  There was no\r\nresponse; his heart seemed to grow cold and his knees to weaken.  The\r\nmatch spluttered and flashed, and in the momentary glare he saw across\r\nthe vault, which was not a large place, a white mass on the ground.  He\r\nhad to go carefully, lest the match should be blown out by the wind of\r\nhis passage; but on coming close he saw that it was Stephen lying\r\nsenseless in front of a great coffin which rested on a built-out pile of\r\nmasonry.  Then the match went out.  In the flare of the next one he lit\r\nhe saw a piece of candle lying on top of the coffin.  He seized and lit\r\nit.  He was able to think coolly despite his agitation, and knew that\r\nlight was the first necessity.  The bruised wick was slow to catch; he\r\nhad to light another match, his last one, before it flamed.  The couple\r\nof seconds that the light went down till the grease melted and the flame\r\nleaped again seemed of considerable length.  When the lit candle was\r\nplaced steadily on top of the coffin, and a light, dim, though strong\r\nenough to see with, spread around, he stooped and lifted Stephen in his\r\narms.  She was quite senseless, and so limp that a great fear came upon\r\nhim that she might be dead.  He did not waste time, but carried her\r\nacross the vault where the door to the church steps stood out sharp\r\nagainst the darkness, and bore her up into the church.  Holding her in\r\none arm, with the other hand he dragged some long cushions from one of\r\nthe pews and spread them on the floor; on these he laid her.  His heart\r\nwas smitten with love and pity as he looked.  She was so helpless; so\r\npitifully helpless!  Her arms and legs were doubled up as though broken,\r\ndisjointed; the white frock was smeared with patches of thick dust.\r\nInstinctively he stooped and pulled the frock down and straightened out\r\nthe arms and feet.  He knelt beside her, and felt if her heart was still\r\nbeating, a great fear over him, a sick apprehension.  A gush of thankful\r\nprayer came from his heart.  Thank God! she was alive; he could feel her\r\nheart beat, though faintly underneath his hand.  He started to his feet\r\nand ran towards the door, seizing his hat, which lay on a seat.  He\r\nwanted it to bring back some water.  As he passed out of the door he saw\r\nLeonard a little distance off, but took no notice of him.  He ran to the\r\nstream, filled his hat with water, and brought it back.  When he came\r\ninto the church he saw Stephen, already partially restored, sitting up on\r\nthe cushions with Leonard supporting her.\r\n\r\nHe was rejoiced; but somehow disappointed.  He would rather Leonard had\r\nnot been there.  He remembered--he could not forget--the white face of\r\nthe boy who fled out of the crypt leaving Stephen in a faint within, and\r\nwho had lingered outside the church door whilst he ran for water.  Harold\r\ncame forward quickly and raised Stephen, intending to bring her into the\r\nfresh air.  He had a shrewd idea that the sight of the sky and God's\r\ngreenery would be the best medicine for her after her fright.  He lifted\r\nher in his strong arms as he used to do when she was a very little child\r\nand had got tired in their walks together; and carried her to the door.\r\nShe lent herself unconsciously to the movement, holding fast with her arm\r\nround his neck as she used to do.  In her clinging was the expression of\r\nher trust in him.  The little sigh with which she laid her head on his\r\nshoulder was the tribute to his masculine power, and her belief in it.\r\nEvery instant her senses were coming back to her more and more.  The veil\r\nof oblivion was passing from her half-closed eyes, as the tide of full\r\nremembrance swept in upon her.  Her inner nature was expressed in the\r\nsequence of her emotions.  Her first feeling was one of her own fault.\r\nThe sight of Harold and his proximity recalled to her vividly how he had\r\nrefused to go into the crypt, and how she had intentionally deceived him,\r\nnegatively, as to her intention of doing that of which he disapproved.\r\nHer second feeling was one of justice; and was perhaps partially evoked\r\nby the sight of Leonard, who followed close as Harold brought her to the\r\ndoor.  She did not wish to speak of herself or Harold before him; but she\r\ndid not hesitate to speak of him to Harold:\r\n\r\n'You must not blame Leonard.  It was all my fault.  I made him come!'  Her\r\ngenerosity appealed to Harold.  He was angry with the boy for being there\r\nat all; but more for his desertion of the girl in her trouble.\r\n\r\n'I'm not blaming him for being with you!' he said simply.  Leonard spoke\r\nat once.  He had been waiting to defend himself, for that was what first\r\nconcerned that young gentleman; next to his pleasure, his safety most\r\nappealed to him.\r\n\r\n'I went to get help.  You had let the candle drop; and how could I see in\r\nthe dark?  You would insist on looking at the plate on the coffin!'\r\n\r\nA low moan broke from Stephen, a long, low, trembling moan which went to\r\nHarold's heart.  Her head drooped over again on his shoulder; and she\r\nclung close to him as the memory of her shock came back to her.  Harold\r\nspoke to Leonard over his shoulder in a low, fierce whisper, which\r\nStephen did not seem to hear:\r\n\r\n'There! that will do.  Go away!  You have done enough already.  Go!  Go!'\r\nhe added more sternly, as the boy seemed disposed to argue.  Leonard ran\r\na few steps, then walked to the lich-gate, where he waited.\r\n\r\nStephen clung close to Harold in a state of agitation which was almost\r\nhysterical.  She buried her face in his shoulder, sobbing brokenly:\r\n\r\n'Oh, Harold!  It was too awful.  I never thought, never for a moment,\r\nthat my poor dear mother was buried in the crypt.  And when I went to\r\nlook at the name on the coffin that was nearest to where I was, I knocked\r\naway the dust, and then I saw her name: \"Margaret Norman, aetat 22.\"  I\r\ncouldn't bear it.  She was only a girl herself, only just twice my\r\nage--lying there in that terrible dark place with all the thick dust and\r\nthe spiders' webs.  Oh, Harold, Harold!  How shall I ever bear to think\r\nof her lying there, and that I shall never see her dear face?  Never!\r\nNever!'\r\n\r\nHe tried to soothe her by patting and holding her hands.  For a good\r\nwhile the resolution of the girl faltered, and she was but as a little\r\nchild.  Then her habitual strength of mind asserted itself.  She did not\r\nask Harold how she came to be out in the church instead of in the crypt\r\nwhen she recovered her senses.  She seemed to take it for granted that\r\nLeonard had carried her out; and when she said how brave it had been of\r\nhim, Harold, with his customary generosity, allowed her to preserve the\r\nbelief.  When they had made their way to the gate Leonard came up to\r\nthem; but before he could speak Stephen had begun to thank him.  He\r\nallowed her to do so, though the sight of Harold's mouth set in scorn,\r\nand his commanding eyes firmly fixed on him, made him grow hot and cold\r\nalternately.  He withdrew without speaking; and took his way home with a\r\nheart full of bitterness and revengeful feelings.\r\n\r\nIn the park Stephen tried to dust herself, and then Harold tried to\r\nassist her.  But her white dress was incurably soiled, the fine dust of\r\nthe vault seemed to have got ingrained in the muslin.  When she got to\r\nthe house she stole upstairs, so that no one might notice her till she\r\nhad made herself tidy.\r\n\r\nThe next day but one she took Harold for a walk in the afternoon.  When\r\nthey were quite alone and out of earshot she said:\r\n\r\n'I have been thinking all night about poor mother.  Of course I know she\r\ncannot be moved from the crypt.  She must remain there.  But there\r\nneedn't be all that dust.  I want you to come there with me some time\r\nsoon.  I fear I am afraid to go alone.  I want to bring some flowers and\r\nto tidy up the place.  Won't you come with me this time?  I know now,\r\nHarold, why you didn't let me go in before.  But now it is different.\r\nThis is not curiosity.  It is Duty and Love.  Won't you come with me,\r\nHarold?'\r\n\r\nHarold leaped from the edge of the ha-ha where he had been sitting and\r\nheld up his hand.  She took it and leaped down lightly beside him.\r\n\r\n'Come,' he said, 'let us go there now!'  She took his arm when they got\r\non the path again, and clinging to him in her pretty girlish way they\r\nwent together to the piece of garden which she called her own; there they\r\npicked a great bunch of beautiful white flowers.  Then they walked to the\r\nold church.  The door was open and they passed in.  Harold took from his\r\npocket a tiny key.  This surprised her, and heightened the agitation\r\nwhich she naturally suffered from revisiting the place.  She said nothing\r\nwhilst he opened the door to the crypt.  Within, on a bracket, stood some\r\ncandles in glass shades and boxes of matches.  Harold lit three candles,\r\nand leaving one of them on the shelf, and placing his cap beside it, took\r\nthe other two in his hands.  Stephen, holding her flowers tightly to her\r\nbreast with her right hand, took Harold's arm with the left, and with\r\nbeating heart entered the crypt.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes Harold kept her engaged, telling her about the crypt\r\nin his father's church, and how he went down at his last visit to see the\r\ncoffin of his dear father, and how he knelt before it.  Stephen was much\r\nmoved, and held tight to his arm, her heart beating.  But in the time she\r\nwas getting accustomed to the place.  Her eyes, useless at first on\r\ncoming out of the bright sunlight, and not able to distinguish anything,\r\nbegan to take in the shape of the place and to see the rows of great\r\ncoffins that stood out along the far wall.  She also saw with surprise\r\nthat the newest coffin, on which for several reasons her eyes rested, was\r\nno longer dusty but was scrupulously clean.  Following with her eyes as\r\nwell as she could see into the further corners she saw that there the\r\nsame reform had been effected.  Even the walls and ceiling had been swept\r\nof the hanging cobwebs, and the floor was clean with the cleanliness of\r\nablution.  Still holding Harold's arm, she moved over towards her\r\nmother's coffin and knelt before it.  Harold knelt with her; for a little\r\nwhile she remained still and silent, praying inwardly.  Then she rose,\r\nand taking her great bunch of flowers placed them lovingly on the lid of\r\nthe coffin above where she thought her mother's heart would be.  Then she\r\nturned to Harold, her eyes flowing and her cheeks wet with tears, and\r\nlaid her head against his breast.  Her arms could not go round his neck\r\ntill he had bent his head, for with his great height he simply towered\r\nabove her.  Presently she was quiet; the paroxysm of her grief had\r\npassed.  She took Harold's hand in both hers, and together they went to\r\nthe door.  With his disengaged hand, for he would not have disturbed the\r\nother for worlds, Harold put out the lights and locked the door behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the church she held him away from her, and looked him fairly in the\r\nface.  She said slowly:\r\n\r\n'Harold, was it you who had the crypt cleaned?'  He answered in a low\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n'I knew you would want to go again!'\r\n\r\nShe took the great hand which she held between hers, and before he knew\r\nwhat she was doing and could prevent her, raised it to her lips and\r\nkissed it, saying lovingly:\r\n\r\n'Oh, Harold!  No brother in all the wide world could be kinder.  And--and--'\r\nthis with a sob, 'we both thank you; mother and I!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI--A VISIT TO OXFORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next important move in the household was Harold's going to Cambridge.\r\nHis father had always intended this, and Squire Norman had borne his\r\nwishes in mind.  Harold joined Trinity, the college which had been his\r\nfather's, and took up his residence in due course.\r\n\r\nStephen was now nearly twelve.  Her range of friendships, naturally\r\nlimited by her circumstances in life, was enlarged to the full; and if\r\nshe had not many close friends there were at least of them all that was\r\nnumerically possible.  She still kept up to certain degree the little\r\ngatherings which in her childhood were got together for her amusement,\r\nand in the various games then instituted she still took a part.  She\r\nnever lost sight of the fact that her father took a certain pleasure in\r\nher bodily vigour.  And though with her growing years and the conscious\r\nacceptance of her womanhood, she lost sight of the old childish fancy of\r\nbeing a boy instead of a girl, she could not lose sight of the fact that\r\nstrength and alertness are sources of feminine as well as of masculine\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAmongst the young friends who came from time to time during his holidays\r\nwas Leonard Everard, now a tall, handsome boy.  He was one of those boys\r\nwho develop young, and who seem never to have any of that gawky stage so\r\nnoticeable in the youth of men made in a large pattern.  He was always\r\nwell-poised, trim-set, alert; fleet of foot, and springy all over.  In\r\ngames he was _facile princeps_, seeming to make his effort always in the\r\nright way and without exertion, as if by an instinct of physical\r\nmasterdom.  His universal success in such matters helped to give him an\r\neasy debonair manner which was in itself winning.  So physically complete\r\na youth has always a charm.  In its very presence there is a sort of\r\nsympathetic expression, such as comes with the sunshine.\r\n\r\nStephen always in Leonard's presence showed something of the common\r\nattitude.  His youth and beauty and sex all had their influence on her.\r\nThe influence of sex, as it is understood with regard to a later period\r\nof life, did not in her case exist; Cupid's darts are barbed and winged\r\nfor more adult victims.  But in her case Leonard's masculine superiority,\r\nemphasised by the few years between their age, his sublime self-belief,\r\nand, above all, his absolute disregard for herself or her wishes or her\r\nfeelings, put him on a level at which she had to look up to him.  The\r\nfirst step in the ladder of pre-eminence had been achieved when she\r\nrealised that he was not on her level; the second when she experienced\r\nrather than thought that he had more influence on her than she had on\r\nhim.  Here again was a little morsel of hero worship, which, though based\r\non a misconception of fact, was still of influence.  In that episode of\r\nthe crypt she had always believed that it was Leonard who had carried her\r\nout and laid her on the church floor in light and safety.  He had been\r\nstrong enough and resolute enough to do this, whilst she had fainted!\r\nHarold's generous forbearance had really worked to a false end.\r\n\r\nIt was not strange, therefore, that she found occasional companionship\r\nwith the handsome, wilful, domineering boy somewhat of luxury.  She did\r\nnot see him often enough to get tired of him; to find out the weakness of\r\nhis character; to realise his deep-seated, remorseless selfishness.  But\r\nafter all he was only an episode in a young life which was full of\r\ninterests.  Term after term came and went; the holidays had their\r\nseasonable pleasures, occasionally shared in common.  That was all.\r\n\r\nHarold's attitude was the same as ever.  He was of a constant nature; and\r\nnow that manhood was within hail the love of his boyhood was ripening to\r\na man's love.  That was all.  He was with regard to Stephen the same\r\ndevoted, worshipping protector, without thought of self; without hope of\r\nreward.  Whatever Stephen wished Harold did; and Stephen, knowing their\r\nold wishes and their old pleasures, was content with their renewal.  Each\r\nholiday between the terms became mainly a repetition of the days of the\r\nold life.  They lived in the past.\r\n\r\nAmongst the things that did not change was Stephen's riding dress.  The\r\nscarlet habit had never been a thing for everyday wear, but had from the\r\nfirst been kept for special occasions.  Stephen herself knew that it was\r\nnot a conventional costume; but she rather preferred it, if on that\r\naccount alone.  In a certain way she felt justified in using it; for a\r\nred habit was a sort of tradition in the family.\r\n\r\nIt was on one of these occasions that she had gone with Harold into the\r\nchurchyard where they had heard the discussion regarding God and the\r\nAngels.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nWhen Stephen was about sixteen she went for a short visit to Oxford.  She\r\nstayed at Somerville with Mrs. Egerton, an old friend of her mother's,\r\nwho was a professor at the college.  She sent back her maid who had\r\ntravelled with her, as she knew that the college girls did not have\r\nservants of their own.  The visit was prolonged by mutual consent into a\r\nduration of some weeks.  Stephen fell in love with the place and the\r\nlife, and had serious thoughts of joining the college herself.  Indeed\r\nshe had made up her mind to ask her father to allow her, knowing well\r\nthat he would consent to that or to any other wholesome wish of hers.  But\r\nthen came the thought that he would be all alone at home; and following\r\nthat came another thought, and one of more poignant feeling.  He was\r\nalone now!  Already, for many days, she had left him, for the first time\r\nin her life!  Stephen was quick to act; well she knew that at home there\r\nwould be no fault found with her for a speedy return.  Within a few hours\r\nshe had brought her visit to an end, and was by herself, despite Mrs.\r\nEgerton's protest, in the train on the way back to Norcester.\r\n\r\nIn the train she began to review, for the first time, her visit to the\r\nuniversity.  All had been so strange and new and delightful to her that\r\nshe had never stopped for retrospect.  Life in the new and enchanting\r\nplace had been in the moving present.  The mind had been receptive only,\r\ngathering data for later thought.  During her visit she had had no one to\r\ndirect her thought, and so it had been all personal, with the freedom of\r\nindividuality at large.  Of course her mother's friend, skilled in the\r\nmind-workings of average girls, and able to pick her way through\r\nintellectual and moral quagmires, had taken good care to point out to her\r\ncertain intellectual movements and certain moral lessons; just as she had\r\nin their various walks and drives pointed out matters of\r\ninterest--architectural beauties and spots of historic import.  And she\r\nhad taken in, loyally accepted, and thoroughly assimilated all that she\r\nhad been told.  But there were other lessons which were for her young\r\neyes; facts which the older eyes had ceased to notice, if they had ever\r\nnoticed them at all.  The self-content, the sex-content in the endless\r\ntide of young men that thronged the streets and quads and parks; the all-\r\nsufficing nature of sport or study, to whichever their inclinations\r\ntended.  The small part which womankind seemed to have in their lives.\r\nStephen had had, as we know, a peculiar training; whatever her instincts\r\nwere, her habits were largely boy habits.  Here she was amongst boys, a\r\nglorious tide of them; it made now and again her heart beat to look at\r\nthem.  And yet amongst them all she was only an outsider.  She could not\r\ndo anything better than any of them.  Of course, each time she went out,\r\nshe became conscious of admiring glances; she could not be woman without\r\nsuch consciousness.  But it was as a girl that men looked at her, not as\r\nan equal.  As well as personal experience and the lessons of eyes and\r\nears and intelligence, there were other things to classify and adjust;\r\nthings which were entirely from the outside of her own life.  The\r\nfragments of common-room gossip, which it had been her fortune to hear\r\naccidentally now and again.  The half confidences of scandals, borne on\r\nwhispered breaths.  The whole confidences of dormitory and study which\r\nshe had been privileged to share.  All were parts of the new and strange\r\nworld, the great world which had swum into her ken.\r\n\r\nAs she sat now in the train, with some formulation of memory already\r\naccomplished in the two hours of solitude, her first comment, spoken half\r\naudibly, would have surprised her teachers as much as it would have\r\nsurprised herself, if she had been conscious of it; for as yet her\r\nthinking was not self-conscious:\r\n\r\n'Surely, I am not like that!'\r\n\r\nIt was of the women she had been thinking, not of the men.  The glimpse\r\nwhich she had had of her own sex had been an awakening to her; and the\r\nawakening had not been to a pleasant world.  All at once she seemed to\r\nrealise that her sex had defects--littlenesses, meannesses, cowardices,\r\nfalsenesses.  That their occupations were apt to be trivial or narrow or\r\nselfish; that their desires were earthly, and their tastes coarse; that\r\nwhat she held to be goodness was apt to be realised only as fear.  That\r\ninnocence was but ignorance, or at least baffled curiosity.  That . . .\r\n\r\nA flood of shame swept over her, and instinctively she put her hands\r\nbefore her burning face.  As usual, she was running all at once into\r\nextremes.\r\n\r\nAnd above all these was borne upon her, and for the first time in her\r\nlife, that she was herself a woman!\r\n\r\nFor a long time she sat quite still.  The train thrilled and roared on\r\nits way.  Crowded stations took and gave their quantum of living freight;\r\nbut the young girl sat abstracted, unmoved, seemingly unconscious.  All\r\nthe dominance and energy of her nature were at work.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, she was a woman, and had to abide by the exigencies of her\r\nown sex, she would at least not be ruled and limited by woman's weakness.\r\nShe would plan and act and manage things for herself, in her own way.\r\n\r\nWhatever her thoughts might be, she could at least control her acts.  And\r\nthose acts should be based not on woman's weakness, but on man's\r\nstrength!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII--THE NEED OF KNOWING\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Stephen announced her intention of going with her father to the\r\nPetty Sessions Court, there was consternation amongst the female\r\npopulation of Normanstand and Norwood.  Such a thing had not been heard\r\nof in the experiences of any of them.  Courts of Justice were places for\r\nmen; and the lower courts dealt with a class of cases . . . It was quite\r\nimpossible to imagine where any young lady could get such an idea . . .\r\n\r\nMiss Laetitia Rowly recognised that she had a difficult task before her,\r\nfor she was by now accustomed to Stephen's quiet method of having her own\r\nway.\r\n\r\nShe made a careful toilet before driving over to Normanstand.  Her\r\nwearing her best bonnet was a circumstance not unattended with dread for\r\nsome one.  Behold her then, sailing into the great drawing-room at\r\nNormanstand with her mind so firmly fixed on the task before her as to be\r\noblivious of minor considerations.  She was so fond of Stephen, and\r\nadmired so truly her many beauties and fine qualities, that she was\r\nsecure and without flaw in her purpose.  Stephen was in danger, and\r\nthough she doubted if she would be able to effect any change, she was\r\ndetermined that at least she should not go into danger with her eyes\r\nunopened.\r\n\r\nStephen entered hastily and ran to her.  She loved her great-aunt; really\r\nand truly loved her.  And indeed it would have been strange if she had\r\nnot, for from the earliest hour which she could recollect she had\r\nreceived from her nothing but the truest, fondest affection.  Moreover\r\nshe deeply respected the old lady, her truth, her resolution, her\r\nkindliness, her genuine common-sense ability.  Stephen always felt safe\r\nwith her aunt.  In the presence of others she might now and again have a\r\nqualm or a doubt; but not with her.  There was an abiding calm in her\r\nlove, answering love realised and respected.  Her long and intimate\r\nknowledge of Laetitia made her aware of her moods.  She could read the\r\nsigns of them.  She knew well the meaning of the bonnet which actually\r\nseemed to quiver as though it had a sentience of its own.  She knew well\r\nthe cause of her aunt's perturbation; the pain which must be caused to\r\nher was perhaps the point of most resistance in herself--she having made\r\nup her mind to her new experience.  All she could do would be to try to\r\nreconcile her by the assurance of good intention; by reason, and by\r\nsweetness of manner.  When she had kissed her and sat beside her, holding\r\nher hand after her pretty way, she, seeing the elder woman somewhat at a\r\nloss, opened the subject herself:\r\n\r\n'You look troubled, auntie!  I hope it is nothing serious?'\r\n\r\n'It is, my dear!  Very serious!  Everything is serious to me which\r\ntouches you.'\r\n\r\n'Me, Auntie!'  Hypocrisy is a fine art.\r\n\r\n'Yes! yes, Stephen.  Oh! my dear child, what is this I hear about your\r\ngoing to Petty Sessions with your father?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, that!  Why, Auntie dear, you must not let that trouble you.  It is\r\nall right.  That is necessary!'\r\n\r\n'Necessary!' the old lady's figure grew rigid and her voice was loud and\r\nhigh.  'Necessary for a young lady to go to a court house.  To hear low\r\npeople speaking of low crimes.  To listen to cases of the most shocking\r\nkind; cases of low immorality; cases of a kind, of a nature of a--a--class\r\nthat you are not supposed to know anything about.  Really, Stephen! . . .\r\n'  She was drawing away her hand in indignation.  But Stephen held it\r\ntight, as she said very sweetly:\r\n\r\n'That is just it, Auntie.  I am so ignorant that I feel I should know\r\nmore of the lives of those very people!'  Miss Laetitia interrupted:\r\n\r\n'Ignorant!  Of course you are ignorant.  That is what you ought to be.\r\nIsn't it what we have all been devoting ourselves to effect ever since\r\nyou were born?  Read your third chapter of Genesis and remember what came\r\nof eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.'\r\n\r\n'I think the Tree of Knowledge must have been an orange tree.'  The old\r\nlady looked up, her interest aroused:\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'Because ever since Eden other brides have worn its blossom!'  Her tone\r\nwas demure.  Miss Rowly looked sharply at her, but her sharpness softened\r\noff into a smile.\r\n\r\n'H'm!' she said, and was silent.  Stephen seized the opportunity to put\r\nher own case:\r\n\r\n'Auntie dear, you must forgive me!  You really must, for my heart is set\r\non this.  I assure you I am not doing it merely to please myself.  I have\r\nthought over the whole matter.  Father has always wished me to be in a\r\nposition--a position of knowledge and experience--to manage Normanstand\r\nif I should ever succeed him.  From the earliest time I can remember he\r\nhas always kept this before me, and though of course I did not at first\r\nunderstand what it meant, I have seemed in the last few years to know\r\nbetter.  Accordingly I learned all sorts of things under his care, and\r\nsometimes even without his help.  I have studied the estate map, and I\r\nhave been over the estate books and read some of the leases and all such\r\nmatters which they deal with in the estate office.  This only told me the\r\nbones of the thing.  I wanted to know more of our people; and so I made a\r\npoint of going now and again to each house that we own.  Of seeing the\r\npeople and talking with them familiarly; as familiarly as they would let\r\nme, and indeed so far as was possible considering my position.  For,\r\nAuntie dear, I soon began to learn--to learn in a way there was no\r\nmistaking--what my position is.  And so I want to get to know more of\r\ntheir ordinary lives; the darker as well as the lighter side.  I would\r\nlike to do them good.  I can see how my dear daddy has always been a sort\r\nof power to help them, and I would like to carry on his work; to carry it\r\nfurther if I may.  But I must know.'\r\n\r\nHer aunt had been listening with growing interest, and with growing\r\nrespect too, for she realised the intense earnestness which lay behind\r\nthe girl's words and her immediate purpose.  Her voice and manner were\r\nboth softened:\r\n\r\n'But, my dear, surely it is not necessary to go into the Court to know\r\nthese things.  The results of each case become known.'\r\n\r\n'That is just it, Auntie,' she answered quickly.  'The magistrates have\r\nto hear the two sides of the case before even they can make up their\r\nminds.  I want to hear both sides, too!  If people are guilty, I want to\r\nknow the cause of their guilt.  If they are innocent, I want to know what\r\nthe circumstances can be which make innocence look like guilt.  In my own\r\ndaily life I may be in the way of just such judgments; and surely it is\r\nonly right that judgment should be just!'\r\n\r\nAgain she paused; there rose before her mind that conversation in the\r\nchurchyard when Harold had said that it was difficult for women to be\r\njust.\r\n\r\nMiss Rowly reflected too.  She was becoming convinced that in principle\r\nthe girl was right.  But the details were repugnant as ever to her;\r\nconcentrating her mind on the point where she felt the ground firm under\r\nher, she made her objection:\r\n\r\n'But, Stephen dear, there are so many cases that are sordid and painful!'\r\n\r\n'The more need to know of sordid things; if sordidness plays so important\r\na part in the tragedy of their lives!'\r\n\r\n'But there are cases which are not within a woman's province.  Cases that\r\ntouch sin . . . '\r\n\r\n'What kind of sin do you mean?  Surely all wrong-doing is sin!'  The old\r\nlady was embarrassed.  Not by the fact, for she had been for too many\r\nyears the mistress of a great household not to know something of the\r\nsubject on which she spoke, but that she had to speak of such a matter to\r\nthe young girl whom she so loved.\r\n\r\n'The sin, my dear, of . . . of woman's wrong-doing . . . as woman . . .\r\nof motherhood, without marriage!'  All Stephen's nature seemed to rise in\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\n'Why, Auntie,' she spoke out at once, 'you yourself show the want of the\r\nvery experience I look for!'\r\n\r\n'How? what?' asked the old lady amazed and bristling.  Stephen took her\r\nhand and held it affectionately as she spoke:\r\n\r\n'You speak of a woman's wrong-doing, when surely it is a man's as well.\r\nThere does not seem to be blame for him who is the more guilty.  Only for\r\npoor women! . . . And, Auntie dear, it is such poor women that I should\r\nlike to help . . . Not when it is too late, but before!  But how can I\r\nhelp unless I know?  Good girls cannot tell me, and good women won't!  You\r\nyourself, Auntie, didn't want to speak on the subject; even to me!'\r\n\r\n'But, my dear child, these are not things for unmarried women.  I never\r\nspeak of them myself except with matrons.'  Stephen's answer flashed out\r\nlike a sword; and cut like one:\r\n\r\n'And yet you are unmarried!  Oh, Auntie dear, I did not and I do not mean\r\nto be offensive, or to hurt you in any way.  I know, dear, your goodness\r\nand your kindness to all.  But you limit yourself to one side!'  The\r\nelder lady interrupted:\r\n\r\n'How do you mean? one side! which side?'\r\n\r\n'The punishment side.  I want to know the cause of that which brings the\r\npunishment.  There surely is some cross road in a girl's life where the\r\nways part.  I want to stand there if I can, with warning in one hand and\r\nhelp in the other.  Oh! Auntie, Auntie, can't you see that my heart is in\r\nthis . . . These are our people; Daddy says they are to be my people; and\r\nI want to know their lives right through; to understand their wants, and\r\ntheir temptations, and their weakness.  Bad and good, whatever it be, I\r\nmust know it all; or I shall be working in the dark, and may injure or\r\ncrush where I had looked to help and raise.'\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she looked glorified.  The afternoon autumn sun shone full\r\nthrough the great window and lighted her up till she looked like a\r\nspirit.  Lighted her white diaphanous dress till it seemed to take shape\r\nas an ethereal robe; lighted her red hair till it looked like a celestial\r\ncrown; lighted her great dark eyes till their black beauty became swept\r\nin the tide of glory.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the old woman who loved her best heaved, and her bosom\r\nswelled with pride.  Instinctively she spoke:\r\n\r\n'Oh, you noble, beautiful creature!  Of course you are right, and your\r\nway is God's way!'  With tears that rained down her furrowed cheeks, she\r\nput her arms round the girl and kissed her fondly.  Still holding her in\r\nher arms she gave her the gentle counsel which was the aftermath of her\r\nmoment of inspiration.\r\n\r\n'But Stephen dear, do be careful!  Knowledge is a two-edged sword, and it\r\nis apt to side with pride.  Remember what was the last temptation of the\r\nserpent to Eve: \"Your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods,\r\nknowing good and evil.\"'\r\n\r\n'I shall be very careful,' she said gravely; and then added as if by an\r\nafterthought, 'of course you understand that my motive is the acquisition\r\nof knowledge?'\r\n\r\n'Yes?' the answer was given interrogatively.\r\n\r\n'Don't you think, dear, that Eve's object was not so much the acquisition\r\nof knowledge as the gratification of curiosity.'\r\n\r\n'That may be,' said the elder lady in a doubtful tone; 'but my dear, who\r\nis to enlighten us as to which is which?  We are apt in such matters to\r\ndeceive ourselves.  The more we know, the better are we able to deceive\r\nothers; and the better we are able to deceive others the better we are\r\nable to deceive ourselves.  As I tell you, dear, knowledge is two-edged\r\nand needs extra carefulness in its use!'\r\n\r\n'True!' said Stephen reflectively.  Long after her aunt had gone she sat\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nOnce again did Miss Rowly try to restrain Stephen from a project.  This\r\nwas when a little later she wished to go for a few days to the University\r\nMission House in the East end of London.  Ever since her visit to Oxford\r\nshe had kept up a correspondence with her mother's old friend.  It was\r\nthis lady's habit to spend a part of vacation in the Mission; and Stephen\r\nhad had much correspondence with her regarding the work.  At last she\r\nwrote that if she might, she would like to come and see for herself.  The\r\nanswer was a cordial invitation, armed with which she asked her father to\r\nallow her to go.  He at once assented.  He had been watching keenly the\r\ndevelopment of her character, and had seen with pride and satisfaction\r\nthat as time went on she seemed to acquire greater resolution, larger\r\nself-dependence.  She was becoming more and more of his ideal.  Without\r\nlosing any of her womanhood, she was beginning to look at things more\r\nfrom a man's point of view than is usually done by, or possible to,\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned at the end of a week she was full of new gravity.  After\r\na while this so far changed that her old lighter moods began to have\r\ntheir place, but it seemed that she never lost, and that she never would\r\nlose, the effect of that week of bitter experience amongst the 'submerged\r\ntenth.'\r\n\r\nThe effect of the mental working was shown by a remark made by Harold\r\nwhen home on his next college vacation.  He had been entering with her on\r\na discussion of an episode on the estate:\r\n\r\n'Stephen, you are learning to be just!'\r\n\r\nAt the moment she was chagrined by the remark, though she accepted it in\r\nsilence; but later, when she had thought the matter over, she took from\r\nit infinite pleasure.  This was indeed to share man's ideas and to think\r\nwith the workings of man's mind.  It encouraged her to further and larger\r\nideas, and to a greater toleration than she had hitherto dreamed of.\r\n\r\nOf all those who loved her, none seemed to understand so fully as\r\nLaetitia Rowly the change in her mental attitude, or rather the\r\ndevelopment of it.  Now and again she tried to deflect or modify certain\r\ncoming forces, so that the educational process in which she had always\r\nhad a part would continue in the right direction.  But she generally\r\nfound that the girl had been over the ground so thoroughly that she was\r\nable to defend her position.  Once, when she had ventured to remonstrate\r\nwith her regarding her attitude of woman's equality with man, she felt as\r\nif Stephen's barque was indeed entering on dangerous seas.  The occasion\r\nhad arisen thus: Stephen had been what her aunt had stigmatised as\r\n'laying down the law' with regard to the position a married woman, and\r\nMiss Rowly, seeing a good argumentative opening, remarked:\r\n\r\n'But what if a woman does not get the opportunity of being married?'\r\nStephen looked at her a moment before saying with conviction:\r\n\r\n'It is a woman's fault if she does not get the opportunity!'  The old\r\nlady smiled as she answered:\r\n\r\n'Her fault?  My dear, what if no man asks her?'  This seemed to her own\r\nmind a poser.\r\n\r\n'Still her own fault!  Why doesn't she ask him?'  Her aunt's lorgnon was\r\ndropped in horrified amazement.\r\n\r\nStephen went on impassively.\r\n\r\n'Certainly!  Why shouldn't she?  Marriage is a union.  As it is in the\r\neye of the law a civil contract, either party to it should be at liberty\r\nto originate the matter.  If a woman is not free to think of a man in all\r\nways, how is she to judge of the suitability of their union?  And if she\r\nis free in theory, why not free to undertake if necessary the initiative\r\nin a matter so momentous to herself?'  The old lady actually groaned and\r\nwrung her hands; she was horrified at such sentiments.  They were daring\r\nenough to think; but to put them in words! . . .\r\n\r\n'Oh, my dear, my dear!' she moaned, 'be careful what you say.  Some one\r\nmight hear you who would not understand, as I do, that you are talking\r\ntheory.'  Stephen's habit of thought stood to her here.  She saw that her\r\naunt was distressed, and as she did not wish to pain her unduly, was\r\nwilling to divert the immediate channel of her fear.  She took the hand\r\nwhich lay in her lap and held it firmly whilst she smiled in the loving\r\nold eyes.\r\n\r\n'Of course, Auntie dear, it is theory.  But still it is a theory which I\r\nhold very strongly!' . . . Here a thought struck her and she said\r\nsuddenly:\r\n\r\n'Did you ever . . . How many proposals did you have, Auntie?'  The old\r\nlady smiled; her thoughts were already diverted.\r\n\r\n'Several, my dear!  It is so long ago that I don't remember!'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes, you do, Auntie!  No woman ever forgets that, no matter what else\r\nshe may or may not remember!  Tell me, won't you?'  The old lady blushed\r\nslightly as she answered:\r\n\r\n'There is no need to specify, my dear.  Let it be at this, that there\r\nwere more than you could count on your right hand!'\r\n\r\n'And why did you refuse them?'  The tone was wheedling, and the elder\r\nwoman loved to hear it.  Wheedling is the courtship, by the young of the\r\nold.\r\n\r\n'Because, my dear, I didn't love them.'\r\n\r\n'But tell me, Auntie, was there never any one that you did love?'\r\n\r\n'Ah! my dear, that is a different matter.  That is the real tragedy of a\r\nwoman's life.'  In flooding reminiscent thought she forgot her\r\nremonstrating; her voice became full of natural pathos:\r\n\r\n'To love; and be helpless!  To wait, and wait, and wait; with your heart\r\nall aflame!  To hope, and hope; till time seems to have passed away, and\r\nall the world to stand still on your hopeless misery!  To know that a\r\nword might open up Heaven; and yet to have to remain mute!  To keep back\r\nthe glances that could enlighten; to modulate the tones that might\r\nbetray!  To see all you hoped for passing away . . . to another! . . . '\r\n\r\nStephen bent over and kissed her, then standing up said:\r\n\r\n'I understand!  Isn't it wrong, Auntie, that there should be such\r\ntragedies?  Should not that glance be given?  Why should that tone be\r\nchecked?  Why should one be mute when a single word might, would, avert\r\nthe tragedy?  Is it not possible, Auntie, that there is something wrong\r\nin our social system when such things can happen; and can happen so\r\noften?'\r\n\r\nShe looked remorseless as well as irresistible in the pride of her\r\nyouthful strength as with eyes that blazed, not flashing as in passion\r\nbut with a steady light that seemed to burn, she continued:\r\n\r\n'Some day women must learn their own strength, as well as they have\r\nlearned their own weakness.  They are taught this latter from their\r\ncradles up; but no one ever seems to teach them wherein their power lies.\r\nThey have to learn this for themselves; and the process and the result of\r\nthe self-teaching are not good.  In the University Settlement I learned\r\nmuch that made my heart ache; but out of it there seemed some lesson for\r\ngood.'  She paused; and her aunt, wishing to keep the subject towards\r\nhigher things, asked:\r\n\r\n'And that lesson, Stephen dear?'  The blazing eyes turned to her so that\r\nshe was stirred by them as the answer came:\r\n\r\n'It is bad women who seem to know men best, and to be able to influence\r\nthem most.  They can make men come and go at will.  They can turn and\r\ntwist and mould them as they choose.  And _they_ never hesitate to speak\r\ntheir own wishes; to ask for what they want.  There are no tragedies, of\r\nthe negative kind, in _their_ lives.  Their tragedies have come and gone\r\nalready; and their power remains.  Why should good women leave power to\r\nsuch as they?  Why should good women's lives be wrecked for a convention?\r\nWhy in the blind following of some society fetish should life lose its\r\ncharm, its possibilities?  Why should love eat its heart out, in vain?\r\nThe time will come when women will not be afraid to speak to men, as they\r\nshould speak, as free and equal.  Surely if a woman is to be the equal\r\nand lifelong companion of a man, the closest to him--nay, the only one\r\nreally close to him: the mother of his children--she should be free at\r\nthe very outset to show her inclination to him just as he would to her.\r\nDon't be frightened, Auntie dear; your eyes are paining me! . . . There!\r\nperhaps I said too much.  But after all it is only theory.  Take for your\r\ncomfort, Auntie dear, that I am free an heart-whole.  You need not fear\r\nfor me; I can see what your dear eyes tell me.  Yes!  I am very young;\r\nperhaps too young to think such things.  But I have thought of them.\r\nThought them all over in every way and phase I can imagine.'\r\n\r\nShe stopped suddenly; bending over, she took the old lady in her arms and\r\nkissed her fondly several times, holding her tight.  Then, as suddenly\r\nreleasing her, she ran away before she could say a word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII--THE T-CART\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Harold took his degree, Stephen's father took her to Cambridge.  She\r\nenjoyed the trip very much; indeed, it seemed under conditions that were\r\nabsolutely happy.\r\n\r\nWhen they had returned to Normanstand, the Squire took an early\r\nopportunity of bringing Harold alone into his study.  He spoke to him\r\nwith what in a very young man would have seemed diffidence:\r\n\r\n'I have been thinking, Harold, that the time has come when you should be\r\naltogether your own master.  I am more than pleased, my boy, with the way\r\nyou have gone through college; it is, I am sure, just as your dear father\r\nwould have wished it, and as it would have pleased him best.'  He paused,\r\nand Harold said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n'I tried hard, sir, to do what I thought he would like; and what you\r\nwould.'  The Squire went on more cheerfully:\r\n\r\n'I know that, my boy!  I know that well.  And I can tell you that it is\r\nnot the least of the pleasures we have all had in your success, how you\r\nhave justified yourself.  You have won many honours in the schools, and\r\nyou have kept the reputation as an athlete which your father was so proud\r\nof.  Well, I suppose in the natural order of things you would go into a\r\nprofession; and of course if you so desire you can do that.  But if you\r\ncan see your way to it I would rather that you stayed here.  My house is\r\nyour home as long as I live; but I don't wish you to feel in any way\r\ndependent.  I want you to stay here if you will; but to do it just\r\nbecause you wish to.  To this end I have made over to you the estate at\r\nCamp which was my father's gift to me when I came of age.  It is not a\r\nvery large one; but it will give you a nice position of your own, and a\r\ncomfortable income.  And with it goes my blessing, my dear boy.  Take it\r\nas a gift from your father and myself!'\r\n\r\nHarold was much moved, not only by the act itself but by the gracious way\r\nof doing it.  There were tears in his eyes as he wrung the Squire's hand;\r\nhis voice thrilled with feeling as he said:\r\n\r\n'Your many goodnesses to my father's son, sir, will, I hope, be justified\r\nby his love and loyalty.  If I don't say much it is because I do not feel\r\nquite master of myself.  I shall try to show in time, as I cannot say it\r\nall at once, all that I feel.'\r\n\r\nHarold continued to live at Normanstand.  The house at Camp was in\r\nreality a charming cottage.  A couple of servants were installed, and now\r\nand again he stayed there for a few days as he wished to get accustomed\r\nto the place.  In a couple of months every one accepted the order of\r\nthings; and life at Normanstand went on much as it had done before Harold\r\nhad gone to college.  There was a man in the house now instead of a boy:\r\nthat was all.  Stephen too was beginning to be a young woman, but the\r\nrelative positions were the same as they had been.  Her growth did not\r\nseem to make an ostensible difference to any one.  The one who might have\r\nnoticed it most, Mrs. Jarrold, had died during the last year of Harold's\r\nlife at college.\r\n\r\nWhen the day came for the quarterly meeting of the magistrates of the\r\ncounty of Norcester, Squire Rowly arranged as usual to drive Squire\r\nNorman.  This had been their habit for good many years.  The two men\r\nusually liked to talk over the meeting as they returned home together.  It\r\nwas a beautiful morning for a drive, and when Rowly came flying up the\r\navenue in his T-cart with three magnificent bays, Stephen ran out on the\r\ntop of the steps to see him draw up.  Rowly was a fine whip, and his\r\nhorses felt it.  Squire Norman was ready, and, after a kiss from Stephen,\r\nclimbed into the high cart.  The men raised their hats and waved good-\r\nbye.  A word from Rowly; with a bound the horses were off.  Stephen stood\r\nlooking at them delighted; all was so sunny, so bright, so happy.  The\r\nworld was so full of life and happiness to-day that it seemed as if it\r\nwould never end; that nothing except good could befall.\r\n\r\nHarold, later on that morning, was to go into Norcester also; so Stephen\r\nwith a lonely day before her set herself to take up loose-ends of all\r\nsorts of little personal matters.  They would all meet at dinner as Rowly\r\nwas to stop the night at Normanstand.\r\n\r\nHarold left the club in good time to ride home to dinner.  As he passed\r\nthe County Hotel he stopped to ask if Squire Norman had left; and was\r\ntold that he had started only a short time before with Squire Rowly in\r\nhis T-cart.  He rode on fast, thinking that perhaps he might overtake\r\nthem and ride on with them.  But the bays knew their work, and did it.\r\nThey kept their start; it was only at the top of the North hill, five\r\nmiles out of Norcester, that he saw them in the distance, flying along\r\nthe level road.  He knew he would not now overtake them, and so rode on\r\nsomewhat more leisurely.\r\n\r\nThe Norcester highroad, when it has passed the village of Brackling,\r\nturns away to the right behind the great clump of oaks.  From this the\r\nroad twists to the left again, making a double curve, and then runs to\r\nNorling Parva in a clear stretch of some miles before reaching the sharp\r\nturn down the hill which is marked 'Dangerous to Cyclists.'  From the\r\nlatter village branches the by-road over the hill which is the short cut\r\nto Normanstand.\r\n\r\nWhen Harold turned the corner under the shadow of the oaks he saw a\r\nbelated road-mender, surrounded by some gaping peasants, pointing\r\nexcitedly in the distance.  The man, who of course knew him, called to\r\nhim to stop.\r\n\r\n'What is it?' he asked, reining up.\r\n\r\n'It be Squire Rowly's bays which have run away with him.  Three on 'em,\r\nall in a row and comin' like the wind.  Squire he had his reins all\r\nright, but they 'osses didn't seem to mind 'un.  They was fair mad and\r\nbolted.  The leader he had got frightened at the heap o' stones theer,\r\nan' the others took scare from him.'\r\n\r\nWithout a word Harold shook his reins and touched the horse with his\r\nwhip.  The animal seemed to understand and sprang forward, covering the\r\nground at a terrific pace.  Harold was not given to alarms, but here\r\nmight be serious danger.  Three spirited horses in a light cart made for\r\npace, all bolting in fright, might end any moment in calamity.  Never in\r\nhis life did he ride faster than on the road to Norling Parva.  Far ahead\r\nof him he could see at the turn, now and again, a figure running.\r\nSomething had happened.  His heart grew cold: he knew as well as though\r\nhe had seen it, the high cart swaying on one wheel round the corner as\r\nthe maddened horses tore on their way; the one jerk too much, and the\r\nmomentary reaction in the crash! . . .\r\n\r\nWith beating heart and eyes aflame in his white face he dashed on.\r\n\r\nIt was all too true.  By the side of the roadway on the inner curve lay\r\nthe cart on its side with broken shafts.  The horses were prancing and\r\nstamping about along the roadway not recovered from their fright.  Each\r\nwas held by several men.\r\n\r\nAnd on the grass two figures were still lying where they had been thrown\r\nout.  Rowly, who had of course been on the off-side, had been thrown\r\nfurthest.  His head had struck the milestone that stood back on the waste\r\nground before the ditch.  There was no need for any one to tell that his\r\nneck had been broken.  The way his head lay on one side, and the twisted,\r\ninert limbs, all told their story plainly enough.\r\n\r\nSquire Norman lay on his back stretched out.  Some one had raised him to\r\na sitting posture and then lowered him again, straightening his limbs.  He\r\ndid not therefore look so dreadful as Rowly, but there were signs of\r\ncoming death in the stertorous breathing, the ooze of blood from nostrils\r\nand ears as well as mouth.  Harold knelt down by him at once and examined\r\nhim.  Those who were round all knew him and stood back.  He felt the ribs\r\nand limbs; so far as he could ascertain by touch no bone was broken.\r\n\r\nJust then the local doctor, for whom some one had run, arrived in his\r\ngig.  He, too, knelt beside the injured man, a quick glance having\r\nsatisfied him that there was only one patient requiring his care.  Harold\r\nstood up and waited.  The doctor looked up, shaking his head.  Harold\r\ncould hardly suppress the groan which was rising in his throat.  He\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n'Is it immediate?  Should his daughter be brought here?'\r\n\r\n'How long would it take her to arrive?'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps half an hour; she would not lose an instant.'\r\n\r\n'Then you had better send for her.'\r\n\r\n'I shall go at once!' answered Harold, turning to jump on his horse,\r\nwhich was held on the road.\r\n\r\n'No, no!' said the doctor, 'send some one else.  You had better stay here\r\nyourself.  He may become conscious just before the end; and he may want\r\nto say something!'  It seemed to Harold that a great bell was sounding in\r\nhis ears.--'Before the end!  Good God!  Poor Stephen!' . . . But this was\r\nno time for sorrow, or for thinking of it.  That would come later.  All\r\nthat was possible must be done; and to do it required a cool head.  He\r\ncalled to one of the lads he knew could ride and said to him:\r\n\r\n'Get on my horse and ride as fast as you can to Normanstand.  Send at\r\nonce to Miss Norman and tell her that she is wanted instantly.  Tell her\r\nthat there has been an accident; that her father is alive, but that she\r\nmust come at once without a moment's delay.  She had better ride my horse\r\nback as it will save time.  She will understand from that the importance\r\nof time.  Quick!'\r\n\r\nThe lad sprang to the saddle, and was off in a flash.  Whilst Harold was\r\nspeaking, the doctor had told the men, who, accustomed to hunting\r\naccidents, had taken a gate from its hinges and held it in readiness, to\r\nbring it closer.  Then under his direction the Squire was placed on the\r\ngate.  The nearest house was only about a hundred yards away; and thither\r\nthey bore him.  He was lifted on a bed, and then the doctor made fuller\r\nexamination.  When he stood up he looked very grave and said to Harold:\r\n\r\n'I greatly fear she cannot arrive in time.  That bleeding from the ears\r\nmeans rupture of the brain.  It is relieving the pressure, however, and\r\nhe may recover consciousness before he dies.  You had better be close to\r\nhim.  There is at present nothing that can be done.  If he becomes\r\nconscious at all it will be suddenly.  He will relapse and probably die\r\nas quickly.'\r\n\r\nAll at once Norman opened his eyes, and seeing him said quietly, as he\r\nlooked around:\r\n\r\n'What place is this, Harold?'\r\n\r\n'Martin's--James Martin's, sir.  You were brought here after the\r\naccident.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I remember!  Am I badly hurt?  I can feel nothing!'\r\n\r\n'I fear so, sir!  I have sent for Stephen.'\r\n\r\n'Sent for Stephen!  Am I about to die?'  His voice, though feeble, was\r\ngrave and even.\r\n\r\n'Alas! sir, I fear so!'  He sank on his knees as he spoke and took him,\r\nhis second father, in his arms.\r\n\r\n'Is it close?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Then listen to me!  If I don't see Stephen, give her my love and\r\nblessing!  Say that with my last breath I prayed God to keep her and make\r\nher happy!  You will tell her this?'\r\n\r\n'I will!  I will!'  He could hardly speak for the emotion which was\r\nchoking him.  Then the voice went on, but slower and weaker:\r\n\r\n'And Harold, my dear boy, you will look after her, will you not?  Guard\r\nher and cherish her, as if you were indeed my son and she your sister!'\r\n\r\n'I will.  So help me God!'  There was a pause of a few seconds which\r\nseemed an interminable time.  Then in a feebler voice Squire Norman spoke\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n'And Harold--bend down--I must whisper!  If it should be that in time you\r\nand Stephen should find that there is another affection between you,\r\nremember that I sanction it--with my dying breath.  But give her time!  I\r\ntrust that to you!  She is young, and the world is all before her.  Let\r\nher choose . . . and be loyal to her if it is another!  It may be a hard\r\ntask, but I trust you, Harold.  God bless you, my other son!'  He rose\r\nslightly and listened.  Harold's heart leaped.  The swift hoof-strokes of\r\na galloping horse were heard . . . The father spoke joyously:\r\n\r\n'There she is!  That is my brave girl!  God grant that she may be in\r\ntime.  I know what it will mean to her hereafter!'\r\n\r\nThe horse stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\nA quick patter of feet along the passage and then Stephen half dressed\r\nwith a peignoir thrown over her, swept into the room.  With the soft\r\nagility of a leopard she threw herself on her knees beside her father and\r\nput her arms round him.  The dying man motioned to Harold to raise him.\r\nWhen this had been done he laid his hand tenderly on his daughter's head,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n'Let now, O Lord, Thy servant depart in peace!  God bless and keep you,\r\nmy dear child!  You have been all your life a joy and a delight to me!  I\r\nshall tell your mother when I meet her all that you have been to me!\r\nHarold, be good to her!  Good-bye--Stephen! . . . Margaret! . . . '\r\n\r\nHis head fell over, and Harold, laying him gently down, knelt beside\r\nStephen.  He put his arm round her; and she, turning to him, laid her\r\nhand on his breast and sobbed as though her heart would break.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the two squires were brought to Normanstand.  Rowly had\r\nlong ago said that if he died unmarried he would like to lie beside his\r\nhalf-sister, and that it was fitting that, as Stephen would be the new\r\nSquire of Norwood, her dust should in time lie by his.  When the terrible\r\nnews of her nephew's and of Norman's death came to Norwood, Miss Laetitia\r\nhurried off to Normanstand as fast as the horses could bring her.\r\n\r\nHer coming was an inexpressible comfort to Stephen.  After the first\r\noverwhelming burst of grief she had settled into an acute despair.  Of\r\ncourse she had been helped by the fact that Harold had been with her, and\r\nshe was grateful for that too.  But it did not live in her memory of\r\ngratitude in the same way.  Of course Harold was with her in trouble!  He\r\nhad always been; would always be.\r\n\r\nBut the comfort which Aunt Laetitia could give was of a more positive\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nFrom that hour Miss Rowly stayed at Normanstand.  Stephen wanted her; and\r\nshe wanted to be with Stephen.\r\n\r\nAfter the funeral Harold, with an instinctive delicacy of feeling, had\r\ngone to live in his own house; but he came to Normanstand every day.\r\nStephen had so long been accustomed to consulting him about everything\r\nthat there was no perceptible change in their relations.  Even necessary\r\nbusiness to be done did not come as a new thing.\r\n\r\nAnd so things went on outwardly at Normanstand very much as they had done\r\nbefore the coming of the tragedy.  But for a long time Stephen had\r\noccasional bursts of grief which to witness was positive anguish to those\r\nwho loved her.\r\n\r\nThen her duty towards her neighbours became a sort of passion.  She did\r\nnot spare herself by day or by night.  With swift intuition she grasped\r\nthe needs of any ill case which came before her, and with swift movement\r\nshe took the remedy in hand.\r\n\r\nHer aunt saw and approved.  Stephen, she felt, was in this way truly\r\nfulfilling her duty as a woman.  The old lady began to secretly hope, and\r\nalmost to believe, that she had laid aside those theories whose carrying\r\ninto action she so dreaded.\r\n\r\nBut theories do not die so easily.  It is from theory that practice takes\r\nits real strength, as well as its direction.  And did the older woman\r\nwhose life had been bound under more orderly restraint but know, Stephen\r\nwas following out her theories, remorselessly and to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX--IN THE SPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe months since her father's death spread into the second year before\r\nStephen began to realise the loneliness of her life.  She had no\r\ncompanion now but her aunt; and though the old lady adored her, and she\r\nreturned her love in full, the mere years between them made impossible\r\nthe companionship that youth craves.  Miss Rowly's life was in the past.\r\nStephen's was in the future.  And loneliness is a feeling which comes\r\nunbidden to a heart.\r\n\r\nStephen felt her loneliness all round.  In old days Harold was always\r\nwithin hail, and companionship of equal age and understanding was\r\navailable.  But now his very reticence in her own interest, and by her\r\nfather's wishes, made for her pain.  Harold had put his strongest\r\nrestraint on himself, and in his own way suffered a sort of silent\r\nmartyrdom.  He loved Stephen with every fibre of his being.  Day by day\r\nhe came toward her with eager step; day by day he left her with a pang\r\nthat made his heart ache and seemed to turn the brightness of the day to\r\ngloom.  Night by night he tossed for hours thinking, thinking, wondering\r\nif the time would ever come when her kisses would be his . . . But the\r\ntortures and terrors of the night had their effect on his days.  It\r\nseemed as if the mere act of thinking, of longing, gave him ever renewed\r\nself-control, so that he was able in his bearing to carry out the task he\r\nhad undertaken: to give Stephen time to choose a mate for herself.  Herein\r\nlay his weakness--a weakness coming from his want of knowledge of the\r\nworld of women.  Had he ever had a love affair, be it never so mild a\r\none, he would have known that love requires a positive expression.  It is\r\nnot sufficient to sigh, and wish, and hope, and long, all to oneself.\r\nStephen felt instinctively that his guarded speech and manner were due to\r\nthe coldness--or rather the trusting abated worship--of the brotherhood\r\nto which she had been always accustomed.  At the time when new forces\r\nwere manifesting and expanding themselves within her; when her growing\r\ninstincts, cultivated by the senses and the passions of young nature,\r\nmade her aware of other forces, new and old, expanding themselves outside\r\nher; at the time when the heart of a girl is eager for new impressions\r\nand new expansions, and the calls of sex are working within her all\r\nunconsciously, Harold, to whom her heart would probably have been the\r\nfirst to turn, made himself in his effort to best show his love, a\r\n_quantite negligeable_.\r\n\r\nThus Stephen, whilst feeling that the vague desires of budding womanhood\r\nwere trembling within her, had neither thought nor knowledge of their\r\ncharacter or their ultimate tendency.  She would have been shocked,\r\nhorrified, had that logical process, which she applied so freely to less\r\npersonal matters, been used upon her own intimate nature.  In her case\r\nlogic would of course act within a certain range; and as logic is a\r\nconscious intellectual process, she became aware that her objective was\r\nman.  Man--in the abstract.  'Man,' not 'a man.'  Beyond that, she could\r\nnot go.  It is not too much to say that she did not ever, even in her\r\nmost errant thought, apply her reasoning, or even dream of its following\r\nout either the duties, the responsibilities, or the consequences of\r\nhaving a husband.  She had a vague longing for younger companionship, and\r\nof the kind naturally most interesting to her.  There thought stopped.\r\n\r\nOne only of her male acquaintances did not at this time appear.  Leonard\r\nEverard, who had some time ago finished his course at college, was living\r\npartly in London and partly on the Continent.  His very absence made him\r\nof added interest to his old play-fellow.  The image of his grace and\r\ncomeliness, of his dominance and masculine force, early impressed on her\r\nmind, began to compare favourably with the actualities of her other\r\nfriends; those of them at least who were within the circle of her\r\npersonal interest.  'Absence makes the heart grow fonder.'  In Stephen's\r\nmind had been but a very mustard-seed of fondness.  But new lights were\r\nbreaking for her; and all of them, in greater or lesser degree, shone in\r\nturn on the memory of the pretty self-willed dominant boy, who now grew\r\nlarger and more masculine in stature under the instance of each\r\nsuccessive light.  Stephen knew the others fairly well through and\r\nthrough.  The usual mixture of good and evil, of strength and weakness,\r\nof purpose and vacillation, was quite within the scope of her own feeling\r\nand of her observation.  But this man was something of a problem to her;\r\nand, as such, had a prominence in her thoughts quite beyond his own\r\nworthiness.\r\n\r\nIn movement of some form is life; and even ideas grow when the pulses\r\nbeat and thought quickens.  Stephen had long had in her mind the idea of\r\nsexual equality.  For a long time, in deference to her aunt's feelings,\r\nshe had not spoken of it; for the old lady winced in general under any\r\nsuggestion of a breach of convention.  But though her outward expression\r\nbeing thus curbed had helped to suppress or minimise the opportunities of\r\ninward thought, the idea had never left her.  Now, when sex was,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, a dominating factor in her thoughts, the\r\ndormant idea woke to new life.  She had held that if men and women were\r\nequal the woman should have equal rights and opportunities as the man.  It\r\nhad been, she believed, an absurd conventional rule that such a thing as\r\na proposal of marriage should be entirely the prerogative of man.\r\n\r\nAnd then came to her, as it ever does to woman, opportunity.  Opportunity,\r\nthe cruelest, most remorseless, most unsparing, subtlest foe that\r\nwomanhood has.  Here was an opportunity for her to test her own theory;\r\nto prove to herself, and others, that she was right.  They--'they' being\r\nthe impersonal opponents of, or unbelievers in, her theory--would see\r\nthat a woman could propose as well as a man; and that the result would be\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIt is a part of self-satisfaction, and perhaps not the least dangerous\r\npart of it, that it has an increasing or multiplying power of its own.\r\nThe desire to do increases the power to do; and desire and power united\r\nfind new ways for the exercise of strength.  Up to now Stephen's\r\ninclination towards Leonard had been vague, nebulous; but now that theory\r\nshowed a way to its utilisation it forthwith began to become, first\r\ndefinite, then concrete, then substantial.  When once the idea had become\r\na possibility, the mere passing of time did the rest.\r\n\r\nHer aunt saw--and misunderstood.  The lesson of her own youth had not\r\nbeen applied; not even of those long hours and days and weeks at which\r\nshe hinted when she had spoken of the tragedy of life which by inference\r\nwas her own tragedy: 'to love and to be helpless.  To wait, and wait, and\r\nwait, with your heart all aflame!'\r\n\r\nStephen recognised her aunt's concern for her health in time to protect\r\nherself from the curiosity of her loving-kindness.  Her youth and\r\nreadiness and adaptability, and that power of play-acting which we all\r\nhave within us and of which she had her share, stood to her.  With but\r\nlittle effort, based on a seeming acquiescence in her aunt's views, she\r\nsucceeded in convincing the old lady that her incipient feverish cold had\r\nalready reached its crisis and was passing away.  But she had gained\r\ncertain knowledge in the playing of her little part.  All this\r\nself-protective instinct was new; for good or ill she had advanced one\r\nmore step in not only the knowledge but the power of duplicity which is\r\nso necessary in the conventional life of a woman.\r\n\r\nOh! did we but see!  Could we but see!  Here was a woman, dowered in her\r\nyouth with all the goods and graces in the power of the gods to bestow,\r\nwho fought against convention; and who yet found in convention the\r\nstrongest as well as the readiest weapon of defence.\r\n\r\nFor nearly two weeks Stephen's resolution was held motionless, neither\r\nadvancing nor receding; it was veritably the slack water of her\r\nresolution.  She was afraid to go on.  Not afraid in sense of fear as it\r\nis usually understood, but with the opposition of virginal instincts;\r\nthose instincts which are natural, but whose uses as well as whose powers\r\nare unknown to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X--THE RESOLVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next few days saw Stephen abnormally restless.  She had fairly well\r\nmade up her mind to test her theory of equality of the sexes by asking\r\nLeonard Everard to marry her; but her difficulty was as to the doing it.\r\nShe knew well that it would not do to depend on a chance meeting for an\r\nopportunity.  After all, the matter was too serious to allow of the\r\npossibility of levity.  There were times when she thought she would write\r\nto him and make her proffer of affection in this way; but on every\r\noccasion when such thought recurred it was forthwith instantly abandoned.\r\nDuring the last few days, however, she became more reconciled to even\r\nthis method of procedure.  The fever of growth was unabated.  At last\r\ncame an evening which she had all to herself.  Miss Laetitia was going\r\nover to Norwood to look after matters there, and would remain the night.\r\nStephen saw in her absence an opportunity for thought and action, and\r\nsaid that, having a headache, she would remain at home.  Her aunt offered\r\nto postpone her visit.  But she would not hear of it; and so she had the\r\nevening to herself.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner in her boudoir she set herself to the composition of a\r\nletter to Leonard which would convey at least something of her feelings\r\nand wishes towards him.  In the depths of her heart, which now and again\r\nbeat furiously, she had a secret hope that when once the idea was\r\nbroached Leonard would do the rest.  And as she thought of that 'rest' a\r\nlanguorous dreaminess came upon her.  She thought how he would come to\r\nher full of love, of yearning passion; how she would try to keep towards\r\nhim, at first, an independent front which would preserve her secret\r\nanxiety until the time should come when she might yield herself to his\r\narms and tell him all.  For hours she wrote letter after letter,\r\ndestroying them as quickly as she wrote, as she found that she had but\r\nswayed pendulum fashion between overtness and coldness.  Some of the\r\nletters were so chilly in tone that she felt they would defeat their own\r\nobject.  Others were so frankly warm in the expression of--regard she\r\ncalled it, that with burning blushes she destroyed them at once at the\r\ncandle before her.\r\n\r\nAt last she made up her mind.  Just as she had done when a baby she\r\nrealised that the opposing forces were too strong for her; she gave in\r\ngracefully.  It would not do to deal directly in a letter with the matter\r\nin hand.  She would write to Leonard merely asking him to see her.  Then,\r\nwhen they were together without fear of interruption, she would tell him\r\nher views.\r\n\r\nShe got as far as 'Dear Mr. Leonard,' when she stood up, saying to\r\nherself:\r\n\r\n'I shall not be in a hurry.  I must sleep on it before I write!'  She\r\ntook up the novel she had been reading in the afternoon, and read on at\r\nit steadily till her bedtime.\r\n\r\nThat night she did not sleep.  It was not that she was agitated.  Indeed,\r\nshe was more at ease than she had been for days; she had after much\r\nanxious thought made up her mind to a definite course of action.\r\nTherefore her sleeplessness was not painful.  It was rather that she did\r\nnot want to sleep, than that she could not.  She lay still, thinking,\r\nthinking; dreaming such dreams as are the occasions of sanctified privacy\r\nto her age and sex.\r\n\r\nIn the morning she was no worse for her vigil.  When at luncheon-time\r\nAunt Laetitia had returned she went into all the little matters of which\r\nshe had to report.  It was after tea-time when she found herself alone,\r\nand with leisure to attend to what was, she felt, directly her own\r\naffair.  During the night she had made up her mind exactly what to say to\r\nLeonard; and as her specific resolution bore the test of daylight she was\r\nsatisfied.  The opening words had in their inception caused her some\r\nconcern; but after hours of thought she had come to the conclusion that\r\nto address, under the circumstance, the recipient of the letter as 'Dear\r\nMr. Everard' would hardly do.  The only possible justification of her\r\nunconventional act was that there existed already a friendship, an\r\nintimacy of years, since childhood; that there were already between them\r\nknowledge and understanding of each other; that what she was doing, and\r\nabout to do, was but a further step in a series of events long ago\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nShe thought it better to send by post rather than messenger, as the\r\nlatter did away with all privacy with regard to the act.\r\n\r\nThe letter was as follows:\r\n\r\n   'DEAR LEONARD,--Would it be convenient for you to meet me to-morrow,\r\n   Tuesday, at half-past twelve o'clock on the top of Caester Hill?  I\r\n   want to speak about a matter that may have some interest to you, and\r\n   it will be more private there than in the house.  Also it will be\r\n   cooler in the shade on the hilltop.--\r\n\r\n   Yours sincerely, STEPHEN NORMAN.'\r\n\r\nHaving posted the letter she went about the usual routine of her life at\r\nNormanstand, and no occasion of suspicion or remark regarding her came to\r\nher aunt.\r\n\r\nIn her room that night when she had sent away her maid, she sat down to\r\nthink, and all the misgivings of the day came back.  One by one they were\r\nconquered by one protective argument:\r\n\r\n'I am free to do as I like.  I am my own mistress; and I am doing nothing\r\nthat is wrong.  Even if it is unconventional, what of that?  God knows\r\nthere are enough conventions in the world that are wrong, hopelessly,\r\nunalterably wrong.  After all, who are the people who are most bound by\r\nconvention?  Those who call themselves \"smart!\"  If Convention is the god\r\nof the smart set, then it is about time that honest people chose\r\nanother!'\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nLeonard received the letter at breakfast-time.  He did not give it any\r\nspecial attention, as he had other letters at the same time, some of\r\nwhich were, if less pleasant, of more immediate importance.  He had of\r\nlate been bombarded with dunning letters from tradesmen; for during his\r\nUniversity life, and ever since, he had run into debt.  The moderate\r\nallowance his father made him he had treated as cash for incidental\r\nexpenses, but everything else had been on credit.  Indeed he was\r\nbeginning to get seriously alarmed about the future, for his father, who\r\nhad paid his debts once, and at a time when they were by comparison\r\ninconsiderable, had said that he would not under any circumstances pay\r\nothers.  He was not sorry, therefore, for an opportunity of getting away\r\nfor a few hours from home; from himself--from anxieties, possibilities.\r\nThe morning was a sweltering one, and he grumbled to himself as he set\r\nout on his journey through the woods.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nStephen rose fresh and in good spirits, despite her sleepless night.  When\r\nyouth and strength are to the fore, a night's sleep is not of much\r\naccount, for the system once braced up is not allowed to slacken.  It was\r\na notable sign of her strong nature that she was not even impatient, but\r\nwaited with calm fixity the hour at which she had asked Leonard Everard\r\nto meet her.  It is true that as the time grew closer her nerve was less\r\nmarked.  And just before it she was a girl--and nothing more; with all\r\ngirl's diffidence, a girl's self-distrust, a girl's abnegation, a girl's\r\nplasticity.\r\n\r\nIn the more purely personal aspect of her enterprise Stephen's effort was\r\nmore conscious.  It is hardly possible for a pretty woman to seek in her\r\nstudy of perfection the aid of her mirror and to be unconscious of her\r\naims.  There must certainly be at least one dominant purpose: the\r\nachievement of success.  Stephen did not attempt to deny her own beauty;\r\non the contrary she gave it the fullest scope.  There was a certain\r\ntriumph in her glance as she took her last look in her mirror; a\r\ngratification of her wish to show herself in the best way possible.  It\r\nwas a very charming picture which the mirror reflected.\r\n\r\nIt may be that there is a companionship in a mirror, especially to a\r\nwoman; that the reflection of oneself is an emboldening presence, a\r\npersonality which is better than the actuality of an unvalued stranger.\r\nCertainly, when Stephen closed the door and stood in the wainscoted\r\npassage, which was only dimly lit by the high window at either end, her\r\ncourage seemed at once to ooze away.\r\n\r\nProbably for the first time in her life, as she left the shade of the\r\nlong passage and came out on the staircase flooded with the light of the\r\nnoonday sun, Stephen felt that she was a girl--'girl' standing as some\r\nsort of synonym for weakness, pretended or actual.  Fear, in whatever\r\nform or degree it may come, is a vital quality and must move.  It cannot\r\nstand at a fixed point; if it be not sent backward it must progress.\r\nStephen felt this, and, though her whole nature was repugnant to the\r\ntask, forced herself to the effort of repression.  It would, she felt,\r\nhave been to her a delicious pleasure to have abandoned all effort; to\r\nhave sunk in the lassitude of self-surrender.\r\n\r\nThe woman in her was working; her sex had found her out!\r\n\r\nShe turned and looked around her, as though conscious of being watched.\r\nThen, seeing that she was alone, she went her way with settled purpose;\r\nwith flashing eyes and glowing cheeks--and a beating heart.  A heart all\r\nwoman's since it throbbed the most with apprehension when the enemy, Man,\r\nwas the objective of her most resolute attack.  She knew that she must\r\nkeep moving; that she must not stop or pause; or her whole resolution\r\nmust collapse.  And so she hurried on, fearful lest a chance meeting with\r\nany one might imperil her purpose.\r\n\r\nOn she went through the faint moss-green paths; through meadows rich with\r\nflowering grasses and the many reds of the summer wild-flowers.  And so\r\nup through the path cut in the natural dipping of the rock that rose over\r\nCaester Hill and formed a strong base for the clump of great trees that\r\nmade a landmark for many a mile around.  During the first part of her\r\njourney between the house and the hilltop, she tried to hold her purpose\r\nat arm's length; it would be sufficient to face its terrors when the time\r\nhad come.  In the meantime the matter was of such overwhelming importance\r\nthat nothing else could take its place; all she could do was to suspend\r\nthe active part of the thinking faculties and leave the mind only\r\nreceptive.\r\n\r\nBut when she had passed through the thin belt of stunted oak and beech\r\nwhich hedged in the last of the lush meadows, and caught sight of the\r\nclump of trees on the hilltop, she unconsciously braced herself as a\r\nyoung regiment loses its tremors when the sight of the enemy breaks upon\r\nit.  No longer her eyes fell earthward; they were raised, and raised\r\nproudly.  Stephen Norman was fixed in her intention.  Like the woman of\r\nold, her feet were on the ploughshares and she would not hesitate.\r\n\r\nAs she drew near the appointed place her pace grew slower and slower; the\r\nwoman in her was unconsciously manifesting itself.  She would not be\r\nfirst in her tryst with a man.  Unconsciousness, however, is not a\r\nworking quality which can be relied upon for staying power; the approach\r\nto the trysting-place brought once more home to her the strange nature of\r\nher enterprise.  She had made up her mind to it; there was no use in\r\ndeceiving herself.  What she had undertaken to do was much more\r\nunconventional than being first at a meeting.  It was foolish and weak to\r\ndelay.  The last thought braced her up; and it was with a hurried gait,\r\nwhich alone would have betrayed her to an intelligent observer, that she\r\nentered the grove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI--THE MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\nHad Stephen been better acquainted with men and women, she would have\r\nbeen more satisfied with herself for being the first at the tryst.  The\r\nconventional idea, in the minds of most women and of all men, is that a\r\nwoman should never be the first.  But real women, those in whom the heart\r\nbeats strong, and whose blood can leap, know better.  These are the\r\ncommanders of men.  In them sex calls to sex, all unconsciously at first;\r\nand men answer to their call, as they to men's.\r\n\r\nTwo opposite feelings strove for dominance as Stephen found herself on\r\nthe hilltop, alone.  One a feeling natural enough to any one, and\r\nespecially to a girl, of relief that a dreaded hour had been postponed;\r\nthe other of chagrin that she was the first.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments, however, one of the two militant thoughts became\r\ndominant: the feeling of chagrin.  With a pang she thought if she had\r\nbeen a man and summoned for such a purpose, how she would have hurried to\r\nthe trysting-place; how the flying of her feet would have vied with the\r\nquick rapturous beating of her heart!  With a little sigh and a blush,\r\nshe remembered that Leonard did not know the purpose of the meeting; that\r\nhe was a friend almost brought up with her since boy and girl times; that\r\nhe had often been summoned in similar terms and for the most trivial of\r\nsocial purposes.\r\n\r\nFor nearly half an hour Stephen sat on the rustic seat under the shadow\r\nof the great oak, looking, half unconscious of its beauty and yet\r\ninfluenced by it, over the wide landscape stretched at her feet.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her disregard of conventions, she was no fool; the instinct\r\nof wisdom was strong within her, so strong that in many ways it ruled her\r\nconscious efforts.  Had any one told her that her preparations for this\r\ninterview were made deliberately with some of the astuteness that\r\ndominated the Devil when he took Jesus to the top of a high mountain and\r\nshowed him all the kingdoms of the earth at His feet, she would have, and\r\nwith truth, denied it with indignation.  Nevertheless it was a fact that\r\nshe had, in all unconsciousness, chosen for the meeting a spot which\r\nwould evidence to a man, consciously or unconsciously, the desirability\r\nfor his own sake of acquiescence in her views and wishes.  For all this\r\nspreading landscape was her possession, which her husband would share.  As\r\nfar as the eye could reach was within the estate which she had inherited\r\nfrom her father and her uncle.\r\n\r\nThe half-hour passed in waiting had in one way its advantages to the\r\ngirl: though she was still as high strung as ever, she acquired a larger\r\nmeasure of control over herself.  The nervous tension, however, was so\r\ncomplete physically that all her faculties were acutely awake; very early\r\nshe became conscious of a distant footstep.\r\n\r\nTo Stephen's straining ears the footsteps seemed wondrous slow, and more\r\nwondrous regular; she felt instinctively that she would have liked to\r\nhave listened to a more hurried succession of less evenly-marked sounds.\r\nBut notwithstanding these thoughts, and the qualms which came in their\r\nturn, the sound of the coming feet brought great joy.  For, after all,\r\nthey were coming; and coming just in time to prevent the sense of\r\ndisappointment at their delay gaining firm foothold.  It was only when\r\nthe coming was assured that she felt how strong had been the undercurrent\r\nof her apprehension lest they should not come at all.\r\n\r\nVery sweet and tender and beautiful Stephen looked at this moment.  The\r\nstrong lines of her face were softened by the dark fire in her eyes and\r\nthe feeling which glowed in the deep blushes which mantled her cheeks.\r\nThe proudness of her bearing was no less marked than ever, but in the\r\nwillowy sway of her body there was a yielding of mere sorry pride.  In\r\nall the many moods which the gods allow to good women there is none so\r\ndear or so alluring, consciously as well as instinctively, to true men as\r\nthis self-surrender.  As Leonard drew near, Stephen sank softly into a\r\nseat, doing so with a guilty feeling of acting a part.  When he actually\r\ncame into the grove he found her seemingly lost in a reverie as she gazed\r\nout over the wide expanse in front of her.  He was hot after his walk,\r\nand with something very like petulance threw himself into a cane\r\narmchair, exclaiming as he did so with the easy insolence of old\r\nfamiliarity:\r\n\r\n'What a girl you are, Stephen! dragging a fellow all the way up here.\r\nCouldn't you have fixed it down below somewhere if you wanted to see me?'\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, as it seemed to her, Stephen did not dislike his tone\r\nof mastery.  There was something in it which satisfied her.  The\r\nunconscious recognition of his manhood, as opposed to her womanhood,\r\nsoothed her in a peaceful way.  It was easy to yield to a dominant man.\r\nShe was never more womanly than when she answered him softly:\r\n\r\n'It was rather unfair; but I thought you would not mind coming so far.  It\r\nis so cool and delightful here; and we can talk without being disturbed.'\r\nLeonard was lying back in his chair fanning himself with his wide-brimmed\r\nstraw hat, with outstretched legs wide apart and resting on the back of\r\nhis heels.  He replied with grudging condescension:\r\n\r\n'Yes, it's cool enough after the hot tramp over the fields and through\r\nthe wood.  It's not so good as the house, though, in one way: a man can't\r\nget a drink here.  I say, Stephen, it wouldn't be half bad if there were\r\na shanty put up here like those at the Grands Mulets or on the\r\nMatterhorn.  There could be a tap laid on where a fellow could quench his\r\nthirst on a day like this!'\r\n\r\nBefore Stephen's eyes floated a momentary vision of a romantic chalet\r\nwith wide verandah and big windows looking over the landscape; a great\r\nwide stone hearth; quaint furniture made from the gnarled branches of\r\ntrees; skins on the floor; and the walls adorned with antlers, great\r\nhorns, and various trophies of the chase.  And amongst them Leonard, in a\r\npicturesque suit, lolling back just as at present and smiling with a\r\nloving look in his eyes as she handed him a great blue-and-white Munich\r\nbeer mug topped with cool foam.  There was a soft mystery in her voice as\r\nshe answered:\r\n\r\n'Perhaps, Leonard, there will some day be such a place here!'  He seemed\r\nto grumble as he replied:\r\n\r\n'I wish it was here now.  Some day seems a long way off!'\r\n\r\nThis seemed a good opening for Stephen; for the fear of the situation was\r\nagain beginning to assail her, and she felt that if she did not enter on\r\nher task at once, its difficulty might overwhelm her.  She felt angry\r\nwith herself that there was a change in her voice as she said:\r\n\r\n'Some day may mean--can mean everything.  Things needn't be a longer way\r\noff than we choose ourselves, sometimes!'\r\n\r\n'I say, that's a good one!  Do you mean to say that because I am some day\r\nto own Brindehow I can do as I like with it at once, whilst the\r\ngovernor's all there, and a better life than I am any day?  Unless you\r\nwant me to shoot the old man by accident when we go out on the First.'  He\r\nlaughed a short, unmeaning masculine laugh which jarred somewhat on her.\r\nShe did not, however, mean to be diverted from her main purpose, so she\r\nwent on quickly:\r\n\r\n'You know quite well, Leonard, that I don't mean anything of the kind.\r\nBut there was something I wanted to say to you, and I wished that we\r\nshould be alone.  Can you not guess what it is?'\r\n\r\n'No, I'll be hanged if I can!' was his response, lazily given.\r\n\r\nDespite her resolution she turned her head; she could not meet his eyes.\r\nIt cut her with a sharp pain to notice when she turned again that he was\r\nnot looking at her.  He continued fanning himself with his hat as he\r\ngazed out at the view.  She felt that the critical moment of her life had\r\ncome, that it was now or never as to her fulfilling her settled\r\nintention.  So with a rush she went on her way:\r\n\r\n'Leonard, you and I have been friends a long time.  You know my views on\r\nsome points, and that I think a woman should be as free to act as a man!'\r\nShe paused; words and ideas did not seem to flow with the readiness she\r\nexpected.  Leonard's arrogant assurance completed the dragging her back\r\nto earth which her own self-consciousness began:\r\n\r\n'Drive on, old girl!  I know you're a crank from Crankville on some\r\nsubjects.  Let us have it for all you're worth.  I'm on the grass and\r\nlistening.'\r\n\r\nStephen paused.  'A crank from Crankville!'--this after her nights of\r\nsleepless anxiety; after the making of the resolution which had cost her\r\nso much, and which was now actually in process of realisation.  Was it\r\nall worth so much? why not abandon it now? . . . Abandon it!  Abandon a\r\nresolution!  All the obstinacy of her nature--she classed it herself as\r\nfirmness--rose in revolt.  She shook her head angrily, pulled herself\r\ntogether, and went on:\r\n\r\n'That may be! though it's not what I call myself, or what I am usually\r\ncalled, so far as I know.  At any rate my convictions are honest, and I\r\nam sure you will respect them as such, even if you do not share them.'\r\nShe did not see the ready response in his face which she expected, and so\r\nhurried on:\r\n\r\n'It has always seemed to me that a--when a woman has to speak to a man\r\nshe should do so as frankly as she would like him to speak to her, and as\r\nfreely.  Leonard, I--I,' as she halted, a sudden idea, winged with\r\npossibilities of rescuing procrastination came to her.  She went on more\r\neasily:\r\n\r\n'I know you are in trouble about money matters.  Why not let me help\r\nyou?'  He sat up and looked at her and said genially:\r\n\r\n'Well, Stephen, you are a good old sort!  No mistake about it.  Do you\r\nmean to say you would help me to pay my debts, when the governor has\r\nrefused to do so any more?'\r\n\r\n'It would be a great pleasure to me, Leonard, to do anything for your\r\ngood or your pleasure.'\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause; they both sat looking down at the ground.  The\r\nwoman's heart beat loud; she feared that the man must hear it.  She was\r\nconsumed with anxiety, and with a desolating wish to be relieved from the\r\nstrain of saying more.  Surely, surely Leonard could not be so blind as\r\nnot to see the state of things! . . . He would surely seize the occasion;\r\nthrow aside his diffidence and relieve her! . . . His words made a\r\nmomentary music in her ears as he spoke:\r\n\r\n'And is this what you asked me to come here for?'\r\n\r\nThe words filled her with a great shame.  She felt herself a dilemma.  It\r\nhad been no part of her purpose to allude his debts.  Viewed in the light\r\nof what was to follow, it would seem to him that she was trying to\r\nforeclose his affection.   That could not be allowed to pass; the error\r\nmust be rectified.  And yet! . . . And yet this very error must be\r\ncleared up before she could make her full wish apparent.  She seemed to\r\nfind herself compelled by inexorable circumstances into an unlooked-for\r\nbluntness.  In any case she must face the situation.  Her pluck did not\r\nfail her; it was with a very noble and graceful simplicity that she\r\nturned to her companion and said:\r\n\r\n'Leonard, I did not quite mean that.  It would be a pleasure to me to be\r\nof that or any other service to you, if I might be so happy!  But I never\r\nmeant to allude to your debts.   Oh! Leonard, can't you understand!  If\r\nyou were my husband--or--or going to be, all such little troubles would\r\nfall away from you.  But I would not for the world have you think . . . '\r\n\r\nHer very voice failed her.  She could not speak what was in her mind; she\r\nturned away, hiding in her hands her face which fairly seemed to burn.\r\nThis, she thought, was the time for a true lover's opportunity!  Oh, if\r\nshe had been a man, and a woman had so appealed, how he would have sprung\r\nto her side and taken her in his arms, and in a wild rapture of declared\r\naffection have swept away all the pain of her shame!\r\n\r\nBut she remained alone.  There was no springing to her side; no rapture\r\nof declared affection; no obliteration of her shame.  She had to bear it\r\nall alone.  There, in the open; under the eyes that she would fain have\r\nseen any other phase of her distress.  Her heart beat loud and fast; she\r\nwaited to gain her self-control.\r\n\r\nLeonard Everard had his faults, plenty of them, and he was in truth\r\ncomposed of an amalgam of far baser metals than Stephen thought; but he\r\nhad been born of gentle blood and reared amongst gentlefolk.  He did not\r\nquite understand the cause or the amount of his companion's concern; but\r\nhe could not but recognise her distress.  He realised that it had\r\nfollowed hard upon her most generous intention towards himself.  He could\r\nnot, therefore, do less than try to comfort her, and he began his task in\r\na conventional way, but with a blundering awkwardness which was all\r\nmanlike.  He took her hand and held it in his; this much at any rate he\r\nhad learned in sitting on stairs or in conservatories after extra dances.\r\nHe said as tenderly as he could, but with an impatient gesture unseen by\r\nher:\r\n\r\n'Forgive me, Stephen!  I suppose I have said or done something which I\r\nshouldn't.  But I don't know what it is; upon my honour I don't.  Anyhow,\r\nI am truly sorry for it.  Cheer up, old girl!  I'm not your husband, you\r\nknow; so you needn't be distressed.'\r\n\r\nStephen took her courage _a deux mains_.  If Leonard would not speak she\r\nmust.  It was manifestly impossible that the matter could be left in its\r\npresent state.\r\n\r\n'Leonard,' she said softly and solemnly, 'might not that some day be?'\r\n\r\nLeonard, in addition to being an egotist and the very incarnation of\r\nselfishness, was a prig of the first water.  He had been reared\r\naltogether in convention.  Home life and Eton and Christchurch had taught\r\nhim many things, wise as well as foolish; but had tended to fix his\r\nconviction that affairs of the heart should proceed on adamantine lines\r\nof conventional decorum.  It never even occurred to him that a lady could\r\nso far step from the confines of convention as to take the initiative in\r\na matter of affection.  In his blind ignorance he blundered brutally.  He\r\nstruck better than he knew, as, meaning only to pass safely by an awkward\r\nconversational corner, he replied:\r\n\r\n'No jolly fear of that!  You're too much of a boss for me!'  The words\r\nand the levity with which they were spoken struck the girl as with a\r\nwhip.  She turned for an instant as pale as ashes; then the red blood\r\nrushed from her heart, and face and neck were dyed crimson.  It was not a\r\nblush, it was a suffusion.  In his ignorance Leonard thought it was the\r\nformer, and went on with what he considered his teasing.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes!  You know you always want to engineer a chap your own way and\r\nmake him do just as you wish.  The man who has the happiness of marrying\r\nyou, Stephen, will have a hard row to hoe!'  His 'chaff' with its utter\r\nwant of refinement seemed to her, in her high-strung earnest condition,\r\nnothing short of brutal, and for a few seconds produced a feeling of\r\nrepellence.  But it is in the nature of things that opposition of any\r\nkind arouses the fighting instinct of a naturally dominant nature.  She\r\nlost sight of her femininity in the pursuit of her purpose; and as this\r\nwas to win the man to her way of thinking, she took the logical course of\r\nanswering his argument.  If Leonard Everard had purposely set himself to\r\nstimulate her efforts in this direction he could hardly have chosen a\r\nbetter way.  It came somewhat as a surprise to Stephen, when she heard\r\nher own words:\r\n\r\n'I would make a good wife, Leonard!  A husband whom I loved and honoured\r\nwould, I think, not be unhappy!'  The sound of her own voice speaking\r\nthese words, though the tone was low and tender and more self-suppressing\r\nby far than was her wont, seemed to peal like thunder in her own ears.\r\nHer last bolt seemed to have sped.  The blood rushed to her head, and she\r\nhad to hold on to the arms of the rustic chair or she would have fallen\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThe time seemed long before Leonard spoke again; every second seemed an\r\nage.  She seemed to have grown tired of waiting for the sound of his\r\nvoice; it was with a kind of surprise that she heard him say:\r\n\r\n'You limit yourself wisely, Stephen!'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean?' she asked, making a great effort to speak.\r\n\r\n'You would promise to love and honour; but there isn't anything about\r\nobeying.'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke Leonard stretched himself again luxuriously, and laughed with\r\nthe intellectual arrogance of a man who is satisfied with a joke, however\r\ninferior, of his own manufacture.  Stephen looked at him with a long look\r\nwhich began in anger--that anger which comes from an unwonted sense of\r\nimpotence, and ends in tolerance, the intermediate step being admiration.\r\nIt is the primeval curse that a woman's choice is to her husband; and it\r\nis an important part of the teaching of a British gentlewoman, knit in\r\nthe very fibres of her being by the remorseless etiquette of a thousand\r\nyears, that she be true to him.  The man who has in his person the\r\nnecessary powers or graces to evoke admiration in his wife, even for a\r\npassing moment, has a stronghold unconquerable as a rule by all the\r\ndeadliest arts of mankind.\r\n\r\nLeonard Everard was certainly good to look upon as he lolled at his ease\r\non that summer morning.  Tall, straight, supple; a typical British\r\ngentleman of the educated class, with all parts of the body properly\r\ndeveloped and held in some kind of suitable poise.\r\n\r\nAs Stephen looked, the anxiety and chagrin which tormented her seemed to\r\npass.  She realised that here was a nature different from her own, and\r\nwhich should be dealt with in a way unsuitable to herself; and the\r\nconviction seemed to make the action which it necessitated more easy as\r\nwell as more natural to her.  Perhaps for the first time in her life\r\nStephen understood that it may be necessary to apply to individuals a\r\nstandard of criticism unsuitable to self-judgment.  Her recognition might\r\nhave been summed up in the thought which ran through her mind:\r\n\r\n'One must be a little lenient with a man one loves!'\r\n\r\nStephen, when once she had allowed the spirit of toleration to work\r\nwithin her, felt immediately its calming influence.  It was with brighter\r\nthoughts and better humour that she went on with her task.  A task only,\r\nit seemed now; a means to an end which she desired.\r\n\r\n'Leonard, tell me seriously, why do you think I gave you the trouble of\r\ncoming out here?'\r\n\r\n'Upon my soul, Stephen, I don't know.'\r\n\r\n'You don't seem to care either, lolling like that when I am serious!'  The\r\nwords were acid, but the tone was soft and friendly, familiar and\r\ngenuine, putting quite a meaning of its own on them.  Leonard looked at\r\nher indolently:\r\n\r\n'I like to loll.'\r\n\r\n'But can't you even guess, or try to guess, what I ask you?'\r\n\r\n'I can't guess.  The day's too hot, and that shanty with the drinks is\r\nnot built yet.'\r\n\r\n'Or may never be!'  Again he looked at her sleepily.\r\n\r\n'Never be!  Why not?'\r\n\r\n'Because, Leonard, it may depend on you.'\r\n\r\n'All right then.  Drive on!  Hurry up the architect and the\r\njerry-builder!'\r\n\r\nA quick blush leaped to Stephen's cheeks.  The words were full of\r\nmeaning, though the tone lacked something; but the news was too good.  She\r\ncould not accept it at once; she decided to herself to wait a short time.\r\nEre many seconds had passed she rejoiced that she had done so as he went\r\non:\r\n\r\n'I hope you'll give me a say before that husband of yours comes along.  He\r\nmight be a blue-ribbonite; and it wouldn't do to start such a shanty for\r\nrot-gut!'\r\n\r\nAgain a cold wave swept over her.  The absolute difference of feeling\r\nbetween the man and herself; his levity against her earnestness, his\r\ncallous blindness to her purpose, even the commonness of his words\r\nchilled her.  For a few seconds she wavered again in her intention; but\r\nonce again his comeliness and her own obstinacy joined hands and took her\r\nback to her path.  With chagrin she felt that her words almost stuck in\r\nher throat, as summoning up all her resolution she went on:\r\n\r\n'It would be for you I would have it built, Leonard!'  The man sat up\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n'For me?' he asked in a sort of wonderment.\r\n\r\n'Yes, Leonard, for you and me!'  She turned away; her blushes so overcame\r\nher that she could not look at him.  When she faced round again he was\r\nstanding up, his back towards her.\r\n\r\nShe stood up also.  He was silent for a while; so long that the silence\r\nbecame intolerable, and she spoke:\r\n\r\n'Leonard, I am waiting!'  He turned round and said slowly, the absence of\r\nall emotion from his face chilling her till her face blanched:\r\n\r\n'I don't think I would worry about it!'\r\n\r\nStephen Norman was plucky, and when she was face to face with any\r\ndifficulty she was all herself.  Leonard did not look pleasant; his face\r\nwas hard and there was just a suspicion of anger.  Strangely enough, this\r\nlast made the next step easier to the girl; she said slowly:\r\n\r\n'All right!  I think I understand!'\r\n\r\nHe turned from her and stood looking out on the distant prospect.  Then\r\nshe felt that the blow which she had all along secretly feared had fallen\r\non her.  But her pride as well as her obstinacy now rebelled.  She would\r\nnot accept a silent answer.  There must be no doubt left to torture her\r\nafterwards.  She would take care that there was no mistake.  Schooling\r\nherself to her task, and pressing one hand for a moment to her side as\r\nthough to repress the beating of her heart, she came behind him and\r\ntouched him tenderly on the arm.\r\n\r\n'Leonard,' she said softly, 'are you sure there is no mistake?  Do you\r\nnot see that I am asking you,' she intended to say 'to be my husband,'\r\nbut she could not utter the words, they seemed to stick in her mouth, so\r\nshe finished the sentence: 'that I be your wife?'\r\n\r\nThe moment the words were spoken--the bare, hard, naked, shameless\r\nwords--the revulsion came.  As a lightning flash shows up the blackness\r\nof the night the appalling truth of what she had done was forced upon\r\nher.  The blood rushed to her head till cheeks and shoulders and neck\r\nseemed to burn.  Covering her face with her hands she sank back on the\r\nseat crying silently bitter tears that seemed to scald her eyes and her\r\ncheeks as they ran.\r\n\r\nLeonard was angry.  When it began to dawn upon him what was the purpose\r\nof Stephen's speech, he had been shocked.  Young men are so easily\r\nshocked by breaches of convention made by women they respect!  And his\r\npride was hurt.  Why should he have been placed in such a ridiculous\r\nposition!  He did not love Stephen in that way; and she should have known\r\nit.  He liked her and all that sort of thing; but what right had she to\r\nassume that he loved her?  All the weakness of his moral nature came out\r\nin his petulance.  It was boyish that his eyes filled with tears.  He\r\nknew it, and that made him more angry than ever.  Stephen might well have\r\nbeen at a loss to understand his anger, as, with manifest intention to\r\nwound, he answered her:\r\n\r\n'What a girl you are, Stephen.  You are always doing something or other\r\nto put a chap in the wrong and make him ridiculous.  I thought you were\r\njoking--not a good joke either!  Upon my soul, I don't know what I've\r\ndone that you should fix on me!  I wish to goodness--'\r\n\r\nIf Stephen had suffered the red terror before, she suffered the white\r\nterror now.  It was not injured pride, it was not humiliation, it was not\r\nfear; it was something vague and terrible that lay far deeper than any of\r\nthese.  Under ordinary circumstances she would have liked to have spoken\r\nout her mind and given back as good as she got; and even as the thoughts\r\nwhirled through her brain they came in a torrent of vague vituperative\r\neloquence.  But now her tongue was tied.  Instinctively she knew that she\r\nhad put it out of her power to revenge, or even to defend herself.  She\r\nwas tied to the stake, and must suffer without effort and in silence.\r\n\r\nMost humiliating of all was the thought that she must propitiate the man\r\nwho had so wounded her.  All love for him had in the instant passed from\r\nher; or rather she realised fully the blank, bare truth that she had\r\nnever really loved him at all.  Had she really loved him, even a blow at\r\nhis hands would have been acceptable; but now . . .\r\n\r\nShe shook the feelings and thoughts from her as a bird does the water\r\nfrom its wings; and, with the courage and strength and adaptability of\r\nher nature, addressed herself to the hard task which faced her in the\r\nimmediate present.  With eloquent, womanly gesture she arrested the\r\ntorrent of Leonard's indignation; and, as he paused in surprised\r\nobedience, she said:\r\n\r\n'That will do, Leonard!  It is not necessary to say any more; and I am\r\nsure you will see, later on, that at least there was no cause for your\r\nindignation!  I have done an unconventional thing, I know; and I dare say\r\nI shall have to pay for it in humiliating bitterness of thought later on!\r\nBut please remember we are all alone!  This is a secret between us; no\r\none else need ever know or suspect it!'\r\n\r\nShe rose as she concluded.  The quiet dignity of her speech and bearing\r\nbrought back Leonard in some way to his sense of duty as a gentleman.  He\r\nbegan, in a sheepish way, to make an apology:\r\n\r\n'I'm sure I beg your pardon, Stephen.'  But again she held the warning\r\nhand:\r\n\r\n'There is no need for pardon; the fault, if there were any, was mine\r\nalone.  It was I, remember, who asked you to come here and who introduced\r\nand conducted this melancholy business.  I have asked you several things,\r\nLeonard, and one more I will add--'tis only one: that you will forget!'\r\n\r\nAs she moved away, her dismissal of the subject was that of an empress to\r\na serf.  Leonard would have liked to answer her; to have given vent to\r\nhis indignation that, even when he had refused her offer, she should have\r\nthe power to treat him if he was the one refused, and to make him feel\r\nsmall and ridiculous in his own eyes.  But somehow he felt constrained to\r\nsilence; her simple dignity outclassed him.\r\n\r\nThere was another factor too, in his forming his conclusion of silence.\r\nHe had never seen Stephen look so well, or so attractive.  He had never\r\nrespected her so much as when her playfulness had turned to majestic\r\ngravity.  All the boy and girl strife of the years that had gone seemed\r\nto have passed away.  The girl whom he had played with, and bullied, and\r\ntreated as frankly as though she had been a boy, had in an instant become\r\na woman--and such a woman as demanded respect and admiration even from\r\nsuch a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII--ON THE ROAD HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Leonard Everard parted from Stephen he did so with a feeling of\r\ndissatisfaction: firstly, with Stephen; secondly, with things in general;\r\nthirdly, with himself.  The first was definite, concrete, and immediate;\r\nhe could give himself chapter and verse for all the girl's misdoing.\r\nEverything she had said or done had touched some nerve painfully, or had\r\noffended his feelings; and to a man of his temperament his feelings are\r\nvery sacred things, to himself.\r\n\r\n'Why had she put him in such a ridiculous position?  That was the worst\r\nof women.  They were always wanting him to do something he didn't want to\r\ndo, or crying . . . there was that girl at Oxford.'\r\n\r\nHere he turned his head slowly, and looked round in a furtive way, which\r\nwas getting almost a habit with him.  'A fellow should go away so that he\r\nwouldn't have to swear lies.  Women were always wanting money; or worse:\r\nto be married!  Confound women; they all seemed to want him to marry\r\nthem!  There was the Oxford girl, and then the Spaniard, and now\r\nStephen!'  This put his thoughts in a new channel.  He wanted money\r\nhimself.  Why, Stephen had spoken of it herself; had offered to pay his\r\ndebts.  Gad! it was a good idea that every one round the countryside\r\nseemed to know his affairs.  What a flat he had been not to accept her\r\noffer then and there before matters had gone further.  Stephen had lots\r\nof money, more than any girl could want.  But she didn't give him time to\r\nget the thing fixed . . . If he had only known beforehand what she wanted\r\nhe could have come prepared . . . that was the way with women!  Always\r\nthinking of themselves!  And now?  Of course she wouldn't stump up after\r\nhis refusing her.  What would his father say if he came to hear of it?\r\nAnd he must speak to him soon, for these chaps were threatening to County\r\nCourt him if he didn't pay.  Those harpies in Vere Street were quite\r\nnasty . . . '  He wondered if he could work Stephen for a loan.\r\n\r\nHe walked on through the woodland path, his pace slower than before.  'How\r\npretty she had looked!'  Here he touched his little moustache.  'Gad!\r\nStephen was a fine girl anyhow!  If it wasn't for all that red hair . . .\r\nI like 'em dark better! . . . And her being such an infernal boss!'. . .\r\nThen he said unconsciously aloud:\r\n\r\n'If I was her husband I'd keep her to rights!'\r\n\r\nPoor Stephen!\r\n\r\n'So that's what the governor meant by telling me that fortune was to be\r\nhad, and had easily, if a man wasn't a blind fool.  The governor is a\r\nstarchy old party.  He wouldn't speak out straight and say, \"Here's\r\nStephen Norman, the richest girl you are ever likely to meet; why don't\r\nyou make up to her and marry her?\"  But that would be encouraging his son\r\nto be a fortune-hunter!  Rot! . . . And now, just because she didn't tell\r\nme what she wanted to speak about, or the governor didn't give me a hint\r\nso that I might be prepared, I have gone and thrown away the chance.\r\nAfter all it mightn't be so bad.  Stephen is a fine girl! . . . But she\r\nmustn't ever look at me as she did when I spoke about her not obeying.  I\r\nmean to be master in my own house anyhow!\r\n\r\n'A man mustn't be tied down too tight, even if he is married.  And if\r\nthere's plenty of loose cash about it isn't hard to cover up your tracks\r\n. . . I think I'd better think this thing over calmly and be ready when\r\nStephen comes at me again.  That's the way with women.  When a woman like\r\nStephen fixes her cold grey on a man she does not mean to go asleep over\r\nit.  I daresay my best plan will be to sit tight, and let her work\r\nherself up a bit.  There's nothing like a little wholesome neglect for\r\nbringing a girl to her bearings!' . . .\r\n\r\nFor a while he walked on in satisfied self-complacency.\r\n\r\n'Confound her! why couldn't she have let me know that she was fond of me\r\nin some decent way, without all that formal theatrical proposing?  It's a\r\ndeuced annoying thing in the long run the way the women get fond of me.\r\nThough it's nice enough in some ways while it lasts!' he added, as if in\r\nunwilling recognition of fact.  As the path debouched on the highroad he\r\nsaid to himself half aloud:\r\n\r\n'Well, she's a mighty fine girl, anyhow!  And if she is red I've had\r\nabout enough of the black! . . . That Spanish girl is beginning to kick\r\ntoo!  I wish I had never come across . . . '\r\n\r\n'Shut up, you fool!' he said to himself as he walked on.\r\n\r\nWhen he got home he found a letter from his father.  He took it to his\r\nroom before breaking the seal.  It was at least concise and to the point:\r\n\r\n   'The enclosed has been sent to me.  You will have to deal with it\r\n   yourself.  You know my opinion and also my intention.   The items\r\n   which I have marked have been incurred since I spoke to you last about\r\n   your debts.  I shall not pay another farthing for you.  So take your\r\n   own course!\r\n\r\n   'JASPER EVERARD.'\r\n\r\nThe enclosed was a jeweller's bill, the length and the total of which\r\nlengthened his face and drew from him a low whistle.   He held it in his\r\nhand for a long time, standing quite still and silent.  Then drawing a\r\ndeep breath he said aloud:\r\n\r\n'That settles it!  The halter is on me!  It's no use squealing.  If it's\r\nto be a red head on my pillow! . . . All right!  I must only make the\r\nbest of it.  Anyhow I'll have a good time to-day, even if it must be the\r\nlast!'\r\n\r\nThat day Harold was in Norcester on business.  It was late when he went\r\nto the club to dine.  Whilst waiting for dinner he met Leonard Everard,\r\nflushed and somewhat at uncertain in his speech.  It was something of a\r\nshock to Harold to see him in such a state.\r\n\r\nLeonard was, however, an old friend, and man is as a rule faithful to\r\nfriends in this form of distress.  So in his kindly feeling Harold\r\noffered to drive him home, for he knew that he could thus keep him out of\r\nfurther harm.  Leonard thanked him in uncertain speech, and said he would\r\nbe ready.  In the meantime he would go and play billiards with the marker\r\nwhilst Harold was having his dinner.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock Harold's dogcart was ready and he went to look for\r\nLeonard, who had not since come near him.  He found him half asleep in\r\nthe smoking-room, much drunker than he had been earlier in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe drive was fairly long, so Harold made up his mind for a prolonged\r\nterm of uneasiness and anxiety.  The cool night-air, whose effect was\r\nincreased by the rapid motion, soon increased Leonard's somnolence and\r\nfor a while he slept soundly, his companion watching carefully lest he\r\nshould sway over and fall out of the trap.  He even held him up as they\r\nswung round sharp corners.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he woke up, and woke in a nasty temper.  He began to find\r\nfault in an incoherent way with everything.  Harold said little, just\r\nenough to prevent any cause for further grievance.  Then Leonard changed\r\nand became affectionate.  This mood was a greater bore than the other,\r\nbut Harold managed to bear it with stolid indifference.  Leonard was this\r\nby time making promises to do things for him, that as he was what he\r\ncalled a 'goo' fell',' he might count on his help and support in the\r\nfuture.  As Harold knew him to be a wastrel, over head and ears in debt\r\nand with only the succession to a small estate, he did not take much heed\r\nto his maunderings.  At last the drunken man said something which\r\nstartled him so much that he instinctively drew himself together with\r\nsuch suddenness as to frighten the horse and almost make him rear up\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\n'Woa!  Woa!  Steady, boy.  Gently!' he said, quieting him.  Then turning\r\nto his companion said in a voice hollow with emotion and vibrant with\r\nsuppressed passion:\r\n\r\n'What was it you said?'\r\n\r\nLeonard, half awake, and not half of that half master of himself,\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n'I said I will make you agent of Normanstand when I marry Stephen.'\r\n\r\nHarold grew cold.  To hear of any one marrying Stephen was to him like\r\nplunging him in a glacier stream; but to hear her name so lightly spoken,\r\nand by such a man, was a bewildering shock which within a second set his\r\nblood on fire.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' he thundered.  'You marry Ste . . . Miss Norman!\r\nYou're not worthy to untie her shoe!  You indeed!  She wouldn't look on\r\nthe same side of the street with a drunken brute like you!  How dare you\r\nspeak of her in such a way!'\r\n\r\n'Brute!' said Leonard angrily, his vanity reaching inward to heart and\r\nbrain through all the numbing obstacle of his drunken flesh.  'Who's\r\nbrute?  Brute yourself!  Tell you goin' to marry Stephen, 'cos Stephen\r\nwants it.  Stephen loves me.  Loves me with all her red head!  Wha're you\r\ndoin'!  Wha!!'\r\n\r\nHis words merged in a lessening gurgle, for Harold had now got him by the\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n'Take care what you say about that lady! damn you!' he said, putting his\r\nface close the other's with eyes that blazed.  'Don't you dare to mention\r\nher name in such a way, or you will regret it longer than you can think.\r\nLoves you, you swine!'\r\n\r\nThe struggle and the fierce grip on his throat sobered Leonard somewhat.\r\nMomentarily sobbed him to that point when he could be coherent and\r\nvindictive, though not to the point where he could think ahead.  Caution,\r\nwisdom, discretion, taste, were not for him at such a moment.  Guarding\r\nhis throat with both hands in an instinctive and spasmodic manner he\r\nanswered the challenge:\r\n\r\n'Who are you calling swine?  I tell you she loves me.  She ought to know.\r\nDidn't she tell me so this very day!'  Harold drew back his arm to strike\r\nhim in the face, his anger too great for words.  But the other, seeing\r\nthe motion and in the sobering recognition of danger, spoke hastily:\r\n\r\n'Keep your hair on!  You know so jolly much more than I do.  I tell you\r\nthat she told me this and a lot more this morning when she asked me to\r\nmarry her.'\r\n\r\nHarold's heart grew cold as ice.  There is something in the sound of a\r\nvoice speaking truthfully which a true man can recognise.  Through all\r\nLeonard's half-drunken utterings came such a ring of truth; and Harold\r\nrecognised it.  He felt that his voice was weak and hollow as he spoke,\r\nthinking it necessary to give at first a sort of official denial to such\r\na monstrous statement:\r\n\r\n'Liar!'\r\n\r\n'I'm no liar!' answered Leonard.  He would like to have struck him in\r\nanswer to such a word had he felt equal to it.  'She asked me to marry\r\nher to-day on the hill above the house, where I went to meet her by\r\nappointment.  Here!  I'll prove it to you.  Read this!'  Whilst he was\r\nspeaking he had opened the greatcoat and was fumbling in the\r\nbreast-pocket of his coat.  He produced a letter which he handed to\r\nHarold, who took it with trembling hand.  By this time the reins had\r\nfallen slack and the horse was walking quietly.  There was moonlight, but\r\nnot enough to read by.  Harold bent over and lifted the driving-lamp next\r\nto him and turned it so that he could read the envelope.  He could hardly\r\nkeep either lamp or paper still, his hand trembled so when he saw that\r\nthe direction was in Stephen's handwriting.  He was handing it back when\r\nLeonard said again:\r\n\r\n'Open it!  Read it!  You must do so; I tell you, you must!  You called me\r\na liar, and now must read the proof that I am not.  If you don't I shall\r\nhave to ask Stephen to make you!'  Before Harold's mind flashed a rapid\r\nthought of what the girl might suffer in being asked to take part in such\r\na quarrel.  He could not himself even act to the best advantage unless he\r\nknew the truth . . . he took the letter from the envelope and held it\r\nbefore the lamp, the paper fluttering as though in a breeze from the\r\ntrembling of his hand.  Leonard looked on, the dull glare of his eyes\r\nbrightening with malignant pleasure as he beheld the other's concern.  He\r\nowed him a grudge, and by God he would pay it.  Had he not been\r\nstruck--throttled--called a liar! . . .\r\n\r\nAs he read the words Harold's face cleared.  'Why, you infernal young\r\nscoundrel!' he said angrily, 'that letter is nothing but a simple note\r\nfrom a young girl to an old friend--playmate asking him to come to see\r\nher about some trivial thing.  And you construe it into a proposal of\r\nmarriage.  You hound!'  He held the letter whilst he spoke, heedless of\r\nthe outstretched hand of the other waiting to take it back.  There was a\r\ndangerous glitter in Leonard's eyes.  He knew his man and he knew the\r\ntruth of what he had himself said, and he felt, with all the strength of\r\nhis base soul, how best he could torture him.  In the very strength of\r\nHarold's anger, in the poignancy of his concern, in the relief to his\r\nsoul expressed in his eyes and his voice, his antagonist realised the\r\njealousy of one who honours--and loves.  Second by second Leonard grew\r\nmore sober, and more and better able to carry his own idea into act.\r\n\r\n'Give me my letter!' he began.\r\n\r\n'Wait!' said Harold as he put the lamp back into its socket.  'That will\r\ndo presently.  Take back what you said just now!'\r\n\r\n'What?  Take back what?'\r\n\r\n'That base lie; that Miss Norman asked you to marry her.'\r\n\r\nLeonard felt that in a physical struggle for the possession of the letter\r\nhe would be outmatched; but his passion grew colder and more malignant,\r\nand in a voice that cut like the hiss of a snake he spoke slowly and\r\ndeliberately.  He was all sober now; the drunkenness of brain and blood\r\nwas lost, for the time, in the strength of his cold passion.\r\n\r\n'It is true.  By God it is true; every word of it!  That letter, which\r\nyou want to steal, is only a proof that I went to meet her on Caester\r\nHill by her own appointment.  When I got there, she was waiting for me.\r\nShe began to talk about a chalet there, and at first I didn't know what\r\nshe meant--'\r\n\r\nThere was such conviction, such a triumphant truth in his voice, that\r\nHarold was convinced.\r\n\r\n'Stop!' he thundered; 'stop, don't tell me anything.  I don't want to\r\nhear.  I don't want to know.'  He covered his face with his hands and\r\ngroaned.  It was not as though the speaker were a stranger, in which case\r\nhe would have been by now well on in his death by strangulation; he had\r\nknown Leonard all his life, and he was a friend of Stephen's.  And he was\r\nspeaking truth.\r\n\r\nThe baleful glitter of Leonard's eyes grew brighter still.  He was as a\r\nserpent when he goes to strike.  In this wise he struck.\r\n\r\n'I shall not stop.  I shall go on and tell you all I choose.  You have\r\ncalled me liar--twice.  You have also called me other names.  Now you\r\nshall hear the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  And if\r\nyou won't listen to me some one else will.'  Harold groaned again;\r\nLeonard's eyes brightened still more, and the evil smile on his face grew\r\nbroader as he began more and more to feel his power.  He went on to speak\r\nwith a cold deliberate malignancy, but instinctively so sticking to\r\nabsolute truth that he could trust himself to hurt most.  The other\r\nlistened, cold at heart and physically; his veins and arteries seemed\r\nstagnant.\r\n\r\n'I won't tell you anything of her pretty embarrassments; how her voice\r\nfell as she pleaded; how she blushed and stammered.  Why, even I, who am\r\nused to women and their pretty ways and their passions and their\r\nflushings and their stormy upbraidings, didn't quite know for a while\r\nwhat she was driving at.  So at last she spoke out pretty plainly, and\r\ntold me what a fond wife she'd make me if I would only take her!'  Harold\r\nsaid nothing; he only rocked a little as one in pain, and his hands fell.\r\nThe other went on:\r\n\r\n'That is what happened this morning on Caester Hill under the trees where\r\nI met Stephen Norman by her own appointment; honestly what happened.  If\r\nyou don't believe me now you can ask Stephen.  My Stephen!' he added in a\r\nfinal burst of venom as in a gleam of moonlight through a rift in the\r\nshadowy wood he saw the ghastly pallor of Harold's face.  Then he added\r\nabruptly as he held out his hand:\r\n\r\n'Now give me my letter!'\r\n\r\nIn the last few seconds Harold had been thinking.  And as he had been\r\nthinking for the good, the safety, of Stephen, his thoughts flew swift\r\nand true.  This man's very tone, the openness of his malignity, the\r\nunderlying scorn when he spoke of her whom others worshipped, showed him\r\nthe danger--the terrible immediate danger in which she stood from such a\r\nman.  With the instinct of a mind working as truly for the woman he loved\r\nas the needle does to the Pole he spoke quietly, throwing a sneer into\r\nthe tone so as to exasperate his companion--it was brain against brain\r\nnow, and for Stephen's sake:\r\n\r\n'And of course you accepted.  You naturally would!'  The other fell into\r\nthe trap.  He could not help giving an extra dig to his opponent by\r\nproving him once more in the wrong.\r\n\r\n'Oh no, I didn't!  Stephen is a fine girl; but she wants taking down a\r\nbit.  She's too high and mighty just at present, and wants to boss a chap\r\ntoo much.  I mean to be master in my own house; and she's got to begin as\r\nshe will have to go on.  I'll let her wait a bit: and then I'll yield by\r\ndegrees to her lovemaking.  She's a fine girl, for all her red head; and\r\nshe won't be so bad after all!'\r\n\r\nHarold listened, chilled into still and silent amazement.  To hear\r\nStephen spoken of in such a way appalled him.  She of all women! . . .\r\nLeonard never knew how near sudden death he was, as he lay back in his\r\nseat, his eyes getting dull again and his chin sinking.  The drunkenness\r\nwhich had been arrested by his passion was reasserting itself.  Harold\r\nsaw his state in time and arrested his own movement to take him by the\r\nthroat and dash him to the ground.  Even as he looked at him in scornful\r\nhate, the cart gave a lurch and Leonard fell forward.  Instinctively\r\nHarold swept an arm round him and held him up.  As he did so the\r\nunconsciousness of arrested sleep came; Leonard's chin sank on his breast\r\nand he breathed stertorously.\r\n\r\nAs he drove on, Harold's thoughts circled in a tumult.  Vague ideas of\r\nextreme measures which he ought to take flashed up and paled away.\r\nIntention revolved upon itself till its weak side was exposed, and, it\r\nwas abandoned.  He could not doubt the essential truth of Leonard's\r\nstatement regarding the proposal of marriage.  He did not understand this\r\nnor did he try to.  His own love for the girl and the bitter awaking to\r\nits futility made him so hopeless that in his own desolation all the\r\nmystery of her doing and the cause of it was merged and lost.\r\n\r\nHis only aim and purpose now was her safety.  One thing at least he could\r\ndo: by fair means or foul stop Leonard's mouth, so that others need not\r\nknow her shame!  He groaned aloud as the thought came to him.  Beyond\r\nthis first step he could do nothing, think of nothing as yet.  And he\r\ncould not take this first step till Leonard had so far sobered that he\r\ncould understand.\r\n\r\nAnd so waiting for that time to come, he drove on through the silent\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII--HAROLD'S RESOLVE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they went on their way Harold noticed that Leonard's breathing became\r\nmore regular, as in honest sleep.  He therefore drove slowly so that the\r\nother might be sane again before they should arrive at the gate of his\r\nfather's place; he had something of importance to say before they should\r\npart.\r\n\r\nSeeing him sleeping so peacefully, Harold passed a strap round him to\r\nprevent him falling from his seat.  Then he could let his thoughts run\r\nmore freely.  Her safety was his immediate concern; again and again he\r\nthought over what he should say to Leonard to ensure his silence.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was pondering with set brows, he was startled by Leonard's\r\nvoice at his side:\r\n\r\n'Is that you, Harold?  I must have been asleep!'  Harold remained silent,\r\namazed at the change.  Leonard went on, quite awake and coherent:\r\n\r\n'By George!  I must have been pretty well cut.  I don't remember a thing\r\nafter coming down the stairs of the club and you and the hall-porter\r\nhelping me up here.  I say, old chap, you have strapped me up all safe\r\nand tight.  It was good of you to take charge of me.  I hope I haven't\r\nbeen a beastly nuisance!'  Harold answered grimly:\r\n\r\n'It wasn't exactly what I should have called it!'  Then, after looking\r\nkeenly at his companion, he said: 'Are you quite awake and sober now?'\r\n\r\n'Quite.'  The answer came defiantly; there was something in his\r\nquestioner's tone which was militant and aggressive.  Before speaking\r\nfurther Harold pulled up the horse.  They were now crossing bare\r\nmoorland, where anything within a mile could have easily been seen.  They\r\nwere quite alone, and would be undisturbed.  Then he turned to his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n'You talked a good deal in your drunken sleep--if sleep it was.  You\r\nappeared to be awake!'  Leonard answered:\r\n\r\n'I don't remember anything of it.  What did I say?'\r\n\r\n'I am going to tell you.  You said something so strange and so wrong that\r\nyou must answer for it.  But first I must know its truth.'\r\n\r\n'Must!  You are pretty dictatorial,' said Leonard angrily.  'Must answer\r\nfor it!  What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Were you on Caester Hill to-day?'\r\n\r\n'What's that to you?'  There was no mistaking the defiant, quarrelsome\r\nintent.\r\n\r\n'Answer me! were you?'  Harold's voice was strong and calm.\r\n\r\n'What if I was?  It is none of your affair.  Did I say anything in what\r\nyou have politely called my drunken sleep?'\r\n\r\n'You did.'\r\n\r\n'What did I say?'\r\n\r\n'I shall tell you in time.  But I must know the truth as I proceed.  There\r\nis some one else concerned in this, and I must know as I go on.  You can\r\neasily judge by what I say if I am right.'\r\n\r\n'Then ask away and be damned to you!'  Harold's calm voice seemed to\r\nquell the other's turbulence as he went on:\r\n\r\n'Were you on Caester Hill this morning?'\r\n\r\n'I was.'\r\n\r\n'Did you meet Miss --- a lady there?'\r\n\r\n'What . . . I did!'\r\n\r\n'Was it by appointment?'  Some sort of idea or half-recollection seemed\r\nto come to Leonard; he fumbled half consciously in his breast-pocket.\r\nThen he broke out angrily:\r\n\r\n'You have taken my letter!'\r\n\r\n'I know the answer to that question,' said Harold slowly.  'You showed me\r\nthe letter yourself, and insisted on my reading it.'  Leonard's heart\r\nbegan to quail.  He seemed to have an instinctive dread of what was\r\ncoming.  Harold went on calmly and remorselessly:\r\n\r\n'Did a proposal of marriage pass between you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes!'  The answer was defiantly given; Leonard began to feel that his\r\nback was against the wall.\r\n\r\n'Who made it?'  The answer was a sudden attempt at a blow, but Harold\r\nstruck down his hand in time and held it.  Leonard, though a fairly\r\nstrong man, was powerless in that iron grasp.\r\n\r\n'You must answer!  It is necessary that I know the truth.'\r\n\r\n'Why must you?  What have you to do with it?  You are not my keeper!  Nor\r\nStephen's; though I dare say you would like to be!'  The insult cooled\r\nHarold's rising passion, even whilst it wrung his heart.\r\n\r\n'I have to do with it because I choose.  You may find the answer if you\r\nwish in your last insult!  Now, clearly understand me, Leonard Everard.\r\nYou know me of old; and you know that what I say I shall do.  One way or\r\nanother, your life or mine may hang on your answers to me--if necessary!'\r\nLeonard felt himself pulled up.  He knew well the strength and purpose of\r\nthe man.  With a light laugh, which he felt to be, as it was, hollow, he\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n'Well, schoolmaster, as you are asking questions, I suppose I may as well\r\nanswer them.  Go on!  Next!'  Harold went on in the same calm, cold\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n'Who made the proposal of marriage?'\r\n\r\n'She did.'\r\n\r\n'Did . . . Was it made at once and directly, or after some preliminary\r\nsuggestion?'\r\n\r\n'After a bit.  I didn't quite understand at first what she was driving\r\nat.'  There was a long pause.  With an effort Harold went on:\r\n\r\n'Did you accept?'  Leonard hesitated.  With a really wicked scowl he eyed\r\nhis big, powerfully-built companion, who still had his hand as in a vice.\r\nThen seeing no resource, he answered:\r\n\r\n'I did not!  That does not mean that I won't, though!' he added\r\ndefiantly.  To his surprise Harold suddenly released his hand.  There was\r\na grimness in his tone as he said:\r\n\r\n'That will do!  I know now that you have spoken the truth, sober as well\r\nas drunk.  You need say no more.  I know the rest.  Most men--even brutes\r\nlike you, if there are any--would have been ashamed even to think the\r\nthings you said, said openly to me, you hound.  You vile, traitorous,\r\nmean-souled hound!'\r\n\r\n'What did I say?'\r\n\r\n'I know what you said; and I shall not forget it.'  He went on, his voice\r\ndeepening into a stern judicial utterance, as though he were pronouncing\r\na sentence of death:\r\n\r\n'Leonard Everard, you have treated vilely a lady whom I love and honour\r\nmore than I love my own soul.  You have insulted her to her face and\r\nbehind her back.  You have made such disloyal reference to her and to her\r\nmad act in so trusting you, and have so shown your intention of causing,\r\nintentionally or unintentionally, woe to her, that I tell you here and\r\nnow that you hold henceforth your life in your hand.  If you ever mention\r\nto a living soul what you have told me twice to-night, even though you\r\nshould be then her husband; if you should cause her harm though she\r\nshould then be your wife; if you should cause her dishonour in public or\r\nin private, I shall kill you.  So help me God!'\r\n\r\nNot a word more did he say; but, taking up the reins, drove on in silence\r\ntill they arrived at the gate of Brindehow, where he signed to him to\r\nalight.\r\n\r\nHe drove off in silence.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at his own house he sent the servant to bed, and then\r\nwent to his study, where he locked himself in.  Then, and then only, did\r\nhe permit his thoughts to have full range.  For the first time since the\r\nblow had fallen he looked straight in the face the change in his own\r\nlife.  He had loved Stephen so long and so honestly that it seemed to him\r\nnow as if that love had been the very foundation of his life.  He could\r\nnot remember a time when he had not loved her; away back to the time when\r\nhe, a big boy, took her, a little girl, under his care, and devoted\r\nhimself to her.  He had grown into the belief that so strong and so\r\nconsistent an affection, though he had never spoken it or even hinted at\r\nit or inferred it, had become a part of her life as well as of his own.\r\nAnd this was the end of that dreaming!  Not only did she not care for\r\nhim, but found herself with a heart so empty that she needs must propose\r\nmarriage to another man!  There was surely something, more than at\r\npresent he knew of or could understand, behind such an act done by her.\r\nWhy should she ask Everard to marry her?  Why should she ask any man?\r\nWomen didn't do such things! . . . Here he paused.  'Women didn't do such\r\nthings.'  All at once there came back to him fragments of discussions--in\r\nwhich Stephen had had a part, in which matters of convention had been\r\ndealt with.  Out of these dim and shattered memories came a comfort to\r\nhis heart, though his brain could not as yet grasp the reason of it.  He\r\nknew that Stephen had held an unconventional idea as to the equality of\r\nthe sexes.  Was it possible that she was indeed testing one of her\r\ntheories?\r\n\r\nThe idea stirred him so that he could not remain quiet.  He stood up, and\r\nwalked the room.  Somehow he felt light beginning to dawn, though he\r\ncould not tell its source, or guess at the final measure of its fulness.\r\nThe fact of Stephen having done such a thing was hard to bear; but it was\r\nharder to think that she should have done such a thing without a motive;\r\nor worse: with love of Leonard as a motive!  He shuddered as he paused.\r\nShe could not love such a man.  It was monstrous!  And yet she had done\r\nthis thing . . . 'Oh, if she had had any one to advise her, to restrain\r\nher!  But she had no mother!  No mother!  Poor Stephen!'\r\n\r\nThe pity of it, not for himself but for the woman he loved, overcame him.\r\nSitting down heavily before his desk, he put his face on his hands, and\r\nhis great shoulders shook.\r\n\r\nLong, long after the violence of his emotion had passed, he sat there\r\nmotionless, thinking with all the power and sincerity he knew; thinking\r\nfor Stephen's good.\r\n\r\nWhen a strong man thinks unselfishly some good may come out of it.  He\r\nmay blunder; but the conclusion of his reasoning must be in the main\r\nright.  So it was with Harold.  He knew that he was ignorant of women,\r\nand of woman's nature, as distinguished from man's.  The only woman he\r\nhad ever known well was Stephen; and she in her youth and in her\r\nignorance of the world and herself was hardly sufficient to supply to him\r\ndata for his present needs.  To a clean-minded man of his age a woman is\r\nsomething divine.  It is only when in later life disappointment and\r\nexperience have hammered bitter truth into his brain, that he begins to\r\nrealise that woman is not angelic but human.  When he knows more, and\r\nfinds that she is like himself, human and limited but with qualities of\r\npurity and sincerity and endurance which put his own to shame, he\r\nrealises how much better a helpmate she is for man than could be the\r\nvague, unreal creations of his dreams.  And then he can thank God for His\r\ngoodness that when He might have given us Angels He did give us women!\r\n\r\nOf one thing, despite the seeming of facts, he was sure: Stephen did not\r\nlove Leonard.  Every fibre of his being revolted at the thought.  She of\r\nso high a nature; he of so low.  She so noble; he so mean.  Bah! the\r\nbelief was impossible.\r\n\r\nImpossible!  Herein was the manifestation of his ignorance; anything is\r\npossible where love is concerned!  It was characteristic of the man that\r\nin his mind he had abandoned, for the present at all events, his own\r\npain.  He still loved Stephen with all the strength of his nature, but\r\nfor him the selfish side ceased to exist.  He was trying to serve\r\nStephen; and every other thought had to give way.  He had been satisfied\r\nthat in a manner she loved him in some way and in some degree; and he had\r\nhoped that in the fulness of time the childish love would ripen, so that\r\nin the end would come a mutual affection which was of the very essence of\r\nHeaven.  He believed still that she loved him in some way; but the future\r\nthat was based on hope had now been wiped out with a sudden and unsparing\r\nhand.  She had actually proposed marriage to another man.  If the idea of\r\na marriage with him had ever crossed her mind she could have had no doubt\r\nof her feeling toward another. . . . And yet?  And yet he could not\r\nbelieve that she loved Leonard; not even if all trains of reasoning\r\nshould end by leading to that point.  One thing he had at present to\r\naccept, that whatever might be the measure of affection Stephen might\r\nhave for him, it was not love as he understood it.  He resolutely turned\r\nhis back on the thought of his own side of the matter, and tried to find\r\nsome justification of Stephen's act.\r\n\r\n'Seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened to ye' has perhaps\r\na general as well as a special significance.  It is by patient tireless\r\nseeking that many a precious thing has been found.  It was after many a\r\nlong cycle of thought that the seeking and the knocking had effectual\r\nresult.  Harold came to believe, vaguely at first but more definitely as\r\nthe evidence nucleated, that Stephen's act was due to some mad girlish\r\nwish to test her own theory; to prove to herself the correctness of her\r\nown reasoning, the fixity of her own purpose.  He did not go on analysing\r\nfurther; for as he walked the room with a portion of the weight taken\r\nfrom his heart he noticed that the sky was beginning to quicken.  The day\r\nwould soon be upon him, and there was work to be done.  Instinctively he\r\nknew that there was trouble in store for Stephen, and he felt that in\r\nsuch an hour he should be near her.  All her life she had been accustomed\r\nto him.  In her sorrows to confide in him, to tell him her troubles so\r\nthat they might dwindle and pass away; to enhance her pleasures by making\r\nhim a sharer in them.\r\n\r\nHarold was inspirited by the coming of the new day.  There was work to be\r\ndone, and the work must be based on thought.  His thoughts must take a\r\npractical turn; what was he to do that would help Stephen?  Here there\r\ndawned on him for the first time the understanding of a certain\r\nhumiliation which she had suffered; she had been refused!  She who had\r\nstepped so far out of the path of maidenly reserve in which she had\r\nalways walked as to propose marriage to a man, had been refused!  He did\r\nnot, could not, know to the full the measure of such humiliation to a\r\nwoman; but he could guess at any rate a part.  And that guessing made him\r\ngrind his teeth in impotent rage.\r\n\r\nBut out of that rage came an inspiration.  If Stephen had been humiliated\r\nby the refusal of one man, might not this be minimised if she in turn\r\nmight refuse another?  Harold knew so well the sincerity of his own love\r\nand the depth of his own devotion that he was satisfied that he could not\r\nerr in giving the girl the opportunity of refusing him.  It would be some\r\nsort of balm to her wounded spirit to know that Leonard's views were not\r\nshared by all men.  That there were others who would deem it a joy to\r\nserve as her slaves.  When she had refused him she would perhaps feel\r\neasier in her mind.  Of course if she did not refuse him . . . Ah! well,\r\nthen would the gates of Heaven open . . . But that would never be.  The\r\npast could not be blotted out!  All he could do would be to serve her.  He\r\nwould go early.  Such a man as Leonard Everard might make some new\r\ncomplication, and the present was quite bad enough.\r\n\r\nIt was a poor enough thing for him, he thought at length.  She might\r\ntrample on him; but it was for her sake.  And to him what did it matter?\r\nThe worst had come.  All was over now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV--THE BEECH GROVE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning following the proposal Stephen strolled out into a beech\r\ngrove, some little distance from the house, which from childhood had been\r\na favourite haunt of hers.  It was not in the immediate road to anywhere,\r\nand so there was no occasion for any of the household or the garden to go\r\nthrough it or near it.  She did not put on a hat, but took only a\r\nsunshade, which she used in passing over the lawn.  The grove was on the\r\nside of the house away from her own room and the breakfast-room.  When\r\nshe had reached its shade she felt that at last she was alone.\r\n\r\nThe grove was a privileged place.  Long ago a great number of young\r\nbeeches had been planted so thickly that as they grew they shot up\r\nstraight and branchless in their struggle for the light.  Not till they\r\nhad reached a considerable altitude had they been thinned; and then the\r\nthinning had been so effected that, as the high branches began to shoot\r\nout in the freer space, they met in time and interlaced so closely that\r\nthey made in many places a perfect screen of leafy shade.  Here and there\r\nwere rifts or openings through which the light passed; under such places\r\nthe grass was fine and green, or the wild hyacinths in due season tinged\r\nthe earth with blue.  Through the grove some wide alleys had been left:\r\ngreat broad walks where the soft grass grew short and fine, and to whose\r\nedges came a drooping of branches and an upspringing of undergrowth of\r\nlaurel and rhododendron.  At the far ends of these walks were little\r\npavilions of marble built in the classic style which ruled for garden use\r\ntwo hundred years ago.  At the near ends some of them were close to the\r\nbroad stretch of water from whose edges ran back the great sloping banks\r\nof emerald sward dotted here and there with great forest trees.  The\r\ngrove was protected by a ha-ha, so that it was never invaded from\r\nwithout, and the servants of the house, both the domestics and the\r\ngardeners and grooms, had been always forbidden to enter it.  Thus by\r\nlong usage it had become a place of quiet and solitude for the members of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nTo this soothing spot had come Stephen in her pain.  The long spell of\r\nself-restraint during that morning had almost driven her to frenzy, and\r\nshe sought solitude as an anodyne to her tortured soul.  The long anguish\r\nof a third sleepless night, following on a day of humiliation and terror,\r\nhad destroyed for a time the natural resilience of a healthy nature.  She\r\nhad been for so long in the prison of her own purpose with Fear as\r\nwarder; the fetters of conventional life had so galled her that here in\r\nthe accustomed solitude of this place, in which from childhood she had\r\nbeen used to move and think freely, she felt as does a captive who has\r\nescaped from an irksome durance.  As Stephen had all along been free of\r\nmovement and speech, no such opportunities of freedom called to her.  The\r\npent-up passion in her, however, found its own relief.  Her voice was\r\nsilent, and she moved with slow steps, halting often between the green\r\ntree-trunks in the cool shade; but her thoughts ran free, and passion\r\nfound a vent.  No stranger seeing the tall, queenly girl moving slowly\r\nthrough the trees could have imagined the fierce passion which blazed\r\nwithin her, unless he had been close enough to see her eyes.  The habit\r\nof physical restraint to which all her life she had been accustomed, and\r\nwhich was intensified by the experience of the past thirty-six hours,\r\nstill ruled her, even here.  Gradually the habit of security began to\r\nprevail, and the shackles to melt away.  Here had she come in all her\r\nchildish troubles.  Here had she fought with herself, and conquered\r\nherself.  Here the spirits of the place were with her and not against\r\nher.  Here memory in its second degree, habit, gave her the full sense of\r\nspiritual freedom.\r\n\r\nAs she walked to and fro the raging of her spirit changed its objective:\r\nfrom restraint to its final causes; and chief amongst them the pride\r\nwhich had been so grievously hurt.  How she loathed the day that had\r\npassed, and how more than all she hated herself for her part in it; her\r\nmad, foolish, idiotic, self-importance which gave her the idea of such an\r\nact and urged her to the bitter end of its carrying out; her mulish\r\nobstinacy in persisting when every fibre of her being had revolted at the\r\ndoing, and when deep in her inmost soul was a deterring sense of its\r\nfutility.  How could she have stooped to have done such a thing: to ask a\r\nman . . . oh! the shame of it, the shame of it all!  How could she have\r\nbeen so blind as to think that such a man was worthy! . . .\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her whirlwind of passion came a solitary gleam of relief:\r\nshe knew with certainty that she did not love Leonard; that she had never\r\nloved him.  The coldness of disdain to him, the fear of his future acts\r\nwhich was based on disbelief of the existence of that finer nature with\r\nwhich she had credited him, all proved to her convincingly that he could\r\nnever really have been within the charmed circle of her inner life.  Did\r\nshe but know it, there was an even stronger evidence of her indifference\r\nto him in the ready manner in which her thoughts flew past him in their\r\ncircling sweep.  For a moment she saw him as the centre of a host of\r\nbesetting fears; but her own sense of superior power nullified the force\r\nof the vision.  She was able to cope with him and his doings, were there\r\nsuch need.  And so her mind flew back to the personal side of her\r\ntrouble: her blindness, her folly, her shame.\r\n\r\nIn truth she was doing good work for herself.  Her mind was working truly\r\nand to a beneficent end.  One by one she was overcoming the false issues\r\nof her passion and drifting to an end in which she would see herself face\r\nto face and would place so truly the blame for what had been as to make\r\nit a warning and ennobling lesson of her life.  She moved more quickly,\r\npassing to and fro as does a panther in its cage when the desire of\r\nforest freedom is heavy upon it.\r\n\r\nThat which makes the irony of life will perhaps never be understood in\r\nits casual aspect by the finite mind of man.  The 'why' and 'wherefore'\r\nand the 'how' of it is only to be understood by that All-wise\r\nintelligence which can scan the future as well as the present, and see\r\nthe far far-reaching ramifications of those schemes of final development\r\nto which the manifestation of completed character tend.\r\n\r\nTo any mortal it would seem a pity that to Stephen in her solitude, when\r\nher passion was working itself out to an end which might be good, should\r\ncome an interruption which would throw it back upon itself in such a way\r\nas to multiply its malignant force.  But again it is a part of the Great\r\nPlan that instruments whose use man's finite mind could never predicate\r\nshould be employed: the seeming good to evil, the seeming evil to good.\r\n\r\nAs she swept to and fro, her raging spirit compelling to violent\r\nmovement, Stephen's eyes were arrested by the figure of a man coming\r\nthrough the aisles of the grove.  At such a time any interruption of her\r\npassion was a cause for heightening anger; but the presence of a person\r\nwas as a draught to a full-fed furnace.  Most of all, in her present\r\ncondition of mind, the presence of a man--for the thought of a man lay\r\nbehind all her trouble, was as a tornado striking a burning forest.  The\r\nblood of her tortured heart seemed to leap to her brain and to suffuse\r\nher eyes.  She 'saw blood'!\r\n\r\nIt mattered not that the man whom she saw she knew and trusted.  Indeed,\r\nthis but added fuel to the flame.  In the presence of a stranger some of\r\nher habitual self-restraint would doubtless have come back to her.  But\r\nnow the necessity for such was foregone; Harold was her alter ego, and in\r\nhis presence was safety.  He was, in this aspect, but a higher and more\r\nintelligent rendering of the trees around her.  In another aspect he was\r\nan opportune victim, something to strike at.  When the anger of a poison\r\nsnake opens its gland, and the fang is charged with venom, it must strike\r\nat something.  It does not pause or consider what it may be; it strikes,\r\nthough it may be at stone or iron.  So Stephen waited till her victim was\r\nwithin distance to strike.  Her black eyes, fierce with passion and blood-\r\nrimmed as a cobra's, glittered as he passed among the tree-trunks towards\r\nher, eager with his errand of devotion.\r\n\r\nHarold was a man of strong purpose.  Had he not been, he would never have\r\ncome on his present errand.  Never, perhaps, had any suitor set forth on\r\nhis quest with a heavier heart.  All his life, since his very boyhood,\r\nhad been centred round the girl whom to-day he had come to serve.  All\r\nhis thought had been for her: and to-day all he could expect was a gentle\r\ndenial of all his hopes, so that his future life would be at best a\r\nblank.\r\n\r\nBut he would be serving Stephen!  His pain might be to her good; ought to\r\nbe, to a certain extent, to her mental ease.  Her wounded pride would\r\nfind some solace . . . As he came closer the feeling that he had to play\r\na part, veritably to act one, came stronger and stronger upon him, and\r\nfilled him with bitter doubt as to his power.  Still he went on boldly.\r\nIt had been a part of his plan to seem to come eagerly, as a lover should\r\ncome; and so he came.  When he got close to Stephen, all the witchery of\r\nher presence came upon him as of old.  After all, he loved her with his\r\nwhole soul; and the chance had come to tell her so.  Even under the\r\ndistressing conditions of his suit, the effort had its charm.\r\n\r\nStephen schooled herself to her usual attitude with him; and that, too,\r\nsince the effort was based on truth came with a certain ease to her.  At\r\nthe present time, in her present frame of mind, nothing in the wide world\r\ncould give her pleasure; the ease which came, if it did not change her\r\npurpose, increased her power.  Their usual salutation, begun when she was\r\na little baby, was 'Good morning, Stephen!'  'Good morning, Harold!'  It\r\nhad become so much a custom that now it came mechanically on her part.\r\nThe tender reference to childhood's days, though it touched her companion\r\nto the quick, did not appeal to her since she had no special thought of\r\nit.  Had such a thought come to her it might have softened her even to\r\ntears, for Harold had been always deep in her heart.  As might have been\r\nexpected from her character and condition of mind, she was the first to\r\nbegin:\r\n\r\n'I suppose you want to see me about something special, Harold, you have\r\ncome so early.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Stephen.  Very special!'\r\n\r\n'Were you at the house?' she asked in a voice whose quietness might have\r\nconveyed a warning.  She was so suspicious now that she suspected even\r\nHarold of--of what she did not know.  He answered in all simplicity:\r\n\r\n'No.  I came straight here.'\r\n\r\n'How did you know I should be here?'  Her voice was now not only quiet\r\nbut sweet.  Without thinking, Harold blundered on.  His intention was so\r\nsingle-minded, and his ignorance of woman so complete, that he did not\r\nrecognise even elementary truths:\r\n\r\n'I knew you always came here long ago when you were a child when you were\r\nin--'  Here it suddenly flashed upon him that if he seemed to expect that\r\nshe was in trouble as he had purposed saying, he would give away his\r\nknowledge of what had happened and so destroy the work to which he had\r\nset himself.  So he finished the sentence in a lame and impotent manner,\r\nwhich, however, saved complete annihilation as it was verbally accurate:\r\n'in short frocks.'  Stephen needed to know little more.  Her quick\r\nintelligence grasped the fact that there was some purpose afoot which she\r\ndid not know or understand.  She surmised, of course, that it was some\r\nway in connection with her mad act, and she grew cooler in her brain as\r\nwell as colder in her heart as she prepared to learn more.  Stephen had\r\nchanged from girl to woman in the last twenty-four hours; and all the\r\nwoman in her was now awake.  After a moment's pause she said with a\r\nwinning smile:\r\n\r\n'Why, Harold, I've been in long frocks for years.  Why should I come here\r\non this special day on that account?'  Even as she was speaking she felt\r\nthat it would be well to abandon this ground of inquiry.  It had clearly\r\ntold her all it could.  She would learn more by some other means.  So she\r\nwent on in a playful way, as a cat--not a kitten--does when it has got a\r\nmouse:\r\n\r\n'That reason won't work, Harold.  It's quite rusty in the joints.  But\r\nnever mind it!  Tell me why you have come so early?'  This seemed to\r\nHarold to be a heaven-sent opening; he rushed in at once:\r\n\r\n'Because, Stephen, I wanted to ask you to be my wife!  Oh! Stephen, don't\r\nyou know that I love you?  Ever since you were a little girl!  When you\r\nwere a little girl and I a big boy I loved you.  I have loved you ever\r\nsince with all my heart, and soul, and strength.  Without you the world\r\nis a blank to me!  For you and your happiness I would do\r\nanything--anything!'\r\n\r\nThis was no acting.  When once the barrier of beginning had been broken,\r\nhis soul seemed to pour itself out.  The man was vibrant through all his\r\nnature; and the woman's very soul realised its truth.  For an instant a\r\nflame of gladness swept through her; and for the time it lasted put all\r\nother thought aside.\r\n\r\nBut suspicion is a hard metal which does not easily yield to fire.  It\r\ncan come to white heat easily enough, but its melting-point is high\r\nindeed.  When the flame had leaped it had spent its force; the reaction\r\ncame quick.  Stephen's heart seemed to turn to ice, all the heat and life\r\nrushing to her brain.  Her thoughts flashed with convincing quickness;\r\nthere was no time for doubting amid their rush.  Her life was for good or\r\nill at the crossing of the ways.  She had trusted Harold thoroughly.  The\r\nhabit of her whole life from her babyhood up had been to so look to him\r\nas comrade and protector and sympathetic friend.  She was so absolutely\r\nsure of his earnest devotion that this new experience of a riper feeling\r\nwould have been a joy to her, if it should be that his act was all\r\nspontaneous and done in ignorance of her shame.  'Shame' was the generic\r\nword which now summarised to herself her thought of her conduct in\r\nproposing to Leonard.  But of this she must be certain.  She could not,\r\ndare not, go farther till this was settled.  With the same craving for\r\ncertainty with which she convinced herself that Leonard understood her\r\novertures, and with the same dogged courage with which she pressed the\r\nmatter on him, she now went on to satisfy her mind.\r\n\r\n'What did you do yesterday?'\r\n\r\n'I was at Norcester all day.  I went early.  By the way, here is the\r\nribbon you wanted; I think it's exactly the same as the pattern.'  As he\r\nspoke he took a tissue-piper parcel from his pocket and handed it to her.\r\n\r\n'Thanks!' she said.  'Did you meet any friends there?'\r\n\r\n'Not many.'  He answered guardedly; he had a secret to keep.\r\n\r\n'Where did you dine?'\r\n\r\n'At the club!'  He began to be uneasy at this questioning; but he did not\r\nsee any way to avoid answering without creating some suspicion.\r\n\r\n'Did you see any one you knew at the club?'  Her voice as she spoke was a\r\nlittle harder, a little more strained.  Harold noticed the change, rather\r\nby instinct than reason.  He felt that there was danger in it, and\r\npaused.  The pause seemed to suddenly create a new fury in the breast of\r\nStephen.  She felt that Harold was playing with her.  Harold!  If she\r\ncould not trust him, where then was she to look for trust in the world?\r\nIf he was not frank with her, what then meant his early coming; his\r\nseeking her in the grove; his proposal of marriage, which seemed so\r\nsudden and so inopportune?  He must have seen Leonard, and by some means\r\nhave become acquainted with her secret of shame . . . His motive?\r\n\r\nHere her mind halted.  She knew as well as if it had been trumpeted from\r\nthe skies that Harold knew all.  But she must be certain . . . Certain!\r\n\r\nShe was standing erect, her hands held down by her sides and clenched\r\ntogether till the knuckles were white; all her body strung high--like an\r\nover-pitched violin.  Now she raised her right hand and flung it downward\r\nwith a passionate jerk.\r\n\r\n'Answer me!' she cried imperiously.  'Answer me!  Why are you playing\r\nwith me?  Did you see Leonard Everard last night?  Answer me, I say.\r\nHarold An Wolf, you do not lie!  Answer me!'\r\n\r\nAs she spoke Harold grew cold.  From the question he now knew that\r\nStephen had guessed his secret.  The fat was in the fire with a\r\nvengeance.  He did not know what to do, and still remained silent.  She\r\ndid not give him time to think, but spoke again, this time more coldly.\r\nThe white terror had replaced the red:\r\n\r\n'Are you not going to answer me a simple question, Harold?  To be silent\r\nnow is to wrong me!  I have a right to know!'\r\n\r\nIn his trouble, for he felt that say what he would he could only give her\r\nnew pain, he said humbly:\r\n\r\n'Don't ask me, Stephen!  Won't you understand that I want to do what is\r\nbest for you?  Won't you trust me?'  Her answer came harshly.  A more\r\nexperienced man than Harold, one who knew women better, would have seen\r\nhow overwrought she was, and would have made pity the pivot of his future\r\nbearing and acts and words while the interview lasted; pity, and pity\r\nonly.  But to Harold the high ideal was ever the same.  The Stephen whom\r\nhe loved was no subject for pity, but for devotion only.  He knew the\r\nnobility of her nature and must trust it to the end.  When her silence\r\nand her blazing eyes denied his request, he answered her query in a low\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n'I did!'  Even whilst he spoke he was thankful for one thing, he had not\r\nbeen pledged in any way to confidence.  Leonard had forced the knowledge\r\non him; and though he would have preferred a million times over to be\r\nsilent, he was still free to speak.  Stephen's next question came more\r\ncoldly still:\r\n\r\n'Did he tell you of his meeting with me?'\r\n\r\n'He did.'\r\n\r\n'Did he tell you all?'  It was torture to him to answer; but he was at\r\nthe stake and must bear it.\r\n\r\n'I think so!  If it was true.'\r\n\r\n'What did he tell you?  Stay!  I shall ask you the facts myself; the\r\nbroad facts.  We need not go into details . . . '\r\n\r\n'Oh, Stephen!'  She silenced his pleading with an imperious hand.\r\n\r\n'If I can go into this matter, surely you can.  If I can bear the shame\r\nof telling, you can at least bear that of listening.  Remember that\r\nknowing--knowing what you know, or at least what you have heard--you\r\ncould come here and propose marriage to me!'  This she said with a cold,\r\ncutting sarcasm which sounded like the rasping of a roughly-sharpened\r\nknife through raw flesh.  Harold groaned in spirit; he felt a weakness\r\nwhich began at his heart to steal through him.  It took all his manhood\r\nto bear himself erect.  He dreaded what was coming, as of old the once-\r\ntortured victim dreaded the coming torment of the rack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV--THE END OF THE MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen went on in her calm, cold voice:\r\n\r\n'Did he tell you that I had asked him to marry me?'  Despite herself, as\r\nshe spoke the words a red tide dyed her face.  It was not a flush; it was\r\nnot a blush; it was a sort of flood which swept through her, leaving her\r\nin a few seconds whiter than before.  Harold saw and understood.  He\r\ncould not speak; he lowered his head silently.  Her eyes glittered more\r\ncoldly.  The madness that every human being may have once was upon her.\r\nSuch a madness is destructive, and here was something more vulnerable\r\nthan herself.\r\n\r\n'Did he tell you how I pressed him?'  There was no red tide this time,\r\nnor ever again whilst the interview lasted.  To bow in affirmation was\r\ninsufficient; with an effort he answered:\r\n\r\n'I understood so.'  She answered with an icy sarcasm:\r\n\r\n'You understood so!  Oh, I don't doubt he embellished the record with\r\nsome of his own pleasantries.  But you understood it; and that is\r\nsufficient.'  After a pause she went on:\r\n\r\n'Did he tell you that he had refused me?'\r\n\r\n'Yes!'  Harold knew now that he was under the torture, and that there was\r\nno refusing.  She went on, with a light laugh, which wrung his heart even\r\nmore than her pain had done . . . Stephen to laugh like that!\r\n\r\n'And I have no doubt that he embellished that too, with some of his fine\r\nmasculine witticisms.  I understood myself that he was offended at my\r\nasking him.  I understood it quite well; he told me so!'  Then with\r\nfeminine intuition she went on:\r\n\r\n'I dare say that before he was done he said something kindly of the poor\r\nlittle thing that loved him; that loved him so much, and that she had to\r\nbreak down all the bounds of modesty and decorum that had made the women\r\nof her house honoured for a thousand years!  And you listened to him\r\nwhilst he spoke!  Oh-h-h!' she quivered with her white-hot anger, as the\r\nfierce heat in the heart of a furnace quivers.  But her voice was cold\r\nagain as she went on:\r\n\r\n'But who could help loving him?  Girls always did.  It was such a beastly\r\nnuisance!  You \"understood\" all that, I dare say; though perhaps he did\r\nnot put it in such plain words!'  Then the scorn, which up to now had\r\nbeen imprisoned, turned on him; and he felt as though some hose of\r\ndeathly chill was being played upon him.\r\n\r\n'And yet you, knowing that only yesterday, he had refused me--refused my\r\npressing request that he should marry me, come to me hot-foot in the\r\nearly morning and ask me to be your wife.  I thought such things did not\r\ntake place; that men were more honourable, or more considerate, or more\r\nmerciful!  Or at least I used to think so; till yesterday.  No! till to-\r\nday.  Yesterday's doings were my own doings, and I had to bear the\r\npenalty of them myself.  I had come here to fight out by myself the\r\nbattle of my shame . . . '\r\n\r\nHere Harold interrupted her.  He could not bear to hear Stephen use such\r\na word in connection with herself.\r\n\r\n'No!  You must not say \"shame.\"  There is no shame to you, Stephen.  There\r\ncan be none, and no one must say it in my presence!'  In her secret heart\r\nof hearts she admired him for his words; she felt them at the moment sink\r\ninto her memory, and knew that she would never forget the mastery of his\r\nface and bearing.  But the blindness of rage was upon her, and it is of\r\nthe essence of this white-hot anger that it preys not on what is basest\r\nin us, but on what is best.  That Harold felt deeply was her opportunity\r\nto wound him more deeply than before.\r\n\r\n'Even here in the solitude which I had chosen as the battleground of my\r\nshame you had need to come unasked, unthought of, when even a lesser mind\r\nthan yours, for you are no fool, would have thought to leave me alone.  My\r\nshame was my own, I tell you; and I was learning to take my punishment.\r\nMy punishment!  Poor creatures that we are, we think our punishment will\r\nbe what we would like best: to suffer in silence, and not to have spread\r\nabroad our shame!'  How she harped on that word, though she knew that\r\nevery time she uttered it, it cut to the heart of the man who loved her.\r\n'And yet you come right on top of my torture to torture me still more and\r\nillimitably.  You come, you who alone had the power to intrude yourself\r\non my grief and sorrow; power given you by my father's kindness.  You\r\ncome to me without warning, considerately telling me that you knew I\r\nwould be here because I had always come here when I had been in trouble.\r\nNo--I do you an injustice.  \"In trouble\" was not what you said, but that\r\nI had come when I had been in short frocks.  Short frocks!  And you came\r\nto tell me that you loved me.  You thought, I suppose, that as I had\r\nrefused one man, I would jump at the next that came along.  I wanted a\r\nman.  God! God! what have I done that such an affront should come upon\r\nme?  And come, too, from a hand that should have protected me if only in\r\ngratitude for my father's kindness!'  She was eyeing him keenly, with\r\neyes that in her unflinching anger took in everything with the accuracy\r\nof sun-painting.  She wanted to wound; and she succeeded.\r\n\r\nBut Harold had nerves and muscles of steel; and when the call came to\r\nthem they answered.  Though the pain of death was upon him he did not\r\nflinch.  He stood before her like a rock, in all his great manhood; but a\r\nrock on whose summit the waves had cast the wealth of their foam, for his\r\nface was as white as snow.  She saw and understood; but in the madness\r\nupon her she went on trying new places and new ways to wound:\r\n\r\n'You thought, I suppose, that this poor, neglected, despised, rejected\r\nwoman, who wanted so much to marry that she couldn't wait for a man to\r\nask her, would hand herself over to the first chance comer who threw his\r\nhandkerchief to her; would hand over herself--and her fortune!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Stephen!  How can you say such things, think such things?'  The\r\nprotest broke from him with a groan.  His pain seemed to inflame her\r\nstill further; to gratify her hate, and to stimulate her mad passion:\r\n\r\n'Why did I ever see you at all?  Why did my father treat you as a son;\r\nthat when you had grown and got strong on his kindness you could thus\r\ninsult his daughter in the darkest hour of her pain and her shame!'  She\r\nalmost choked with passion.  There was now nothing in the whole world\r\nthat she could trust.  In the pause he spoke:\r\n\r\n'Stephen, I never meant you harm.  Oh, don't speak such wild words.  They\r\nwill come back to you with sorrow afterwards!  I only meant to do you\r\ngood.  I wanted . . . '  Her anger broke out afresh:\r\n\r\n'There; you speak it yourself!  You only wanted to do me good.  I was so\r\nbad that any kind of a husband . . . Oh, get out of my sight!  I wish to\r\nGod I had never seen you!  I hope to God I may never see you again!  Go!\r\nGo!  Go!'\r\n\r\nThis was the end!  To Harold's honest mind such words would have been\r\nimpossible had not thoughts of truth lain behind them.  That Stephen--his\r\nStephen, whose image in his mind shut out every other woman in the world,\r\npast, present, and future--should say such things to any one, that she\r\nshould think such things, was to him a deadly blow.  But that she should\r\nsay them to him! . . . Utterance, even the utterance which speaks in the\r\ninmost soul, failed him.  He had in some way that he knew not\r\nhurt--wounded--killed Stephen; for the finer part was gone from the\r\nStephen that he had known and worshipped so long.  She wished him gone;\r\nshe wished she had never seen him; she hoped to God never to see him\r\nagain.  Life for him was over and done!  There could be no more happiness\r\nin the world; no more wish to work, to live! . . .\r\n\r\nHe bowed gravely; and without a word turned and walked away.\r\n\r\nStephen saw him go, his tall form moving amongst the tree trunks till\r\nfinally it was lost in their massing.  She was so filled with the tumult\r\nof her passion that she looked, unmoved.  Even the sense of his going did\r\nnot change her mood.  She raged to and fro amongst the trees, her\r\nmovements getting quicker and quicker as her excitement began to change\r\nfrom mental to physical; till the fury began to exhaust itself.  All at\r\nonce she stopped, as though arrested by a physical barrier; and with a\r\nmoan sank down in a helpless heap on the cool moss.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nHarold went from the grove as one seems to move in a dream.  Little\r\nthings and big were mixed up in his mind.  He took note, as he went\r\ntowards the town by the byroads, of everything around him in his usual\r\nway, for he had always been one of those who notice unconsciously, or\r\nrather unintentionally.  Long afterwards he could shut his eyes and\r\nrecall every step of the way from the spot where he had turned from\r\nStephen to the railway station outside Norcester.  And on many and many\r\nsuch a time when he opened them again the eyelids were wet.  He wanted to\r\nget away quickly, silently, unobserved.  With the instinct of habitual\r\nthought his mind turned London-ward.  He met but few persons, and those\r\nonly cottiers.  He saluted them in his usual cheery way, but did not stop\r\nto speak with any.  He was about to take a single ticket to London when\r\nit struck him that this might look odd, so he asked for a return.  Then,\r\nhis mind being once more directed towards concealment of purpose, he sent\r\na telegram to his housekeeper telling her that he was called away to\r\nLondon on business.  It was only when he was far on his journey that he\r\ngave thought to ways and means, and took stock of his possessions.  Before\r\nhe took out his purse and pocket-book he made up his mind that he would\r\nbe content with what it was, no matter how little.  He had left\r\nNormanstand and all belonging to it for ever, and was off to hide himself\r\nin whatever part of the world would afford him the best opportunity.  Life\r\nwas over!  There was nothing to look forward to; nothing to look back at!\r\nThe present was a living pain whose lightest element was despair.  As,\r\nhowever, he got further and further away, his practical mind began to\r\nwork; he thought over matters so as to arrange in his mind how best he\r\ncould dispose of his affairs, so to cause as little comment as might be,\r\nand to save the possibility of worry or distress of any kind to Stephen.\r\n\r\nEven then, in his agony of mind, his heart was with her; it was not the\r\nleast among his troubles that he would have to be away from her when\r\nperhaps she would need him most.  And yet whenever he would come to this\r\npoint in his endless chain of thought, he would have to stop for a while,\r\novercome with such pain that his power of thinking was paralysed.  He\r\nwould never, could never, be of service to her again.  He had gone out of\r\nher life, as she had gone out of his life; though she never had, nor\r\nnever could out of his thoughts.  It was all over!  All the years of\r\nsweetness, of hope, and trust, and satisfied and justified faith in each\r\nother, had been wiped out by that last terrible, cruel meeting.  Oh! how\r\ncould she have said such things to him!  How could she have thought them!\r\nAnd there she was now in all the agony of her unrestrained passion.  Well\r\nhe knew, from his long experience of her nature, how she must have\r\nsuffered to be in such a state of mind, to have so forgotten all the\r\nrestraint of her teaching and her life!  Poor, poor Stephen!  Fatherless\r\nnow as well as motherless; and friendless as well as fatherless!  No one\r\nto calm her in the height of her wild abnormal passion!  No one to\r\ncomfort her when the fit had passed!  No one to sympathise with her for\r\nall that she had suffered!  No one to help her to build new and better\r\nhopes out of the wreck of her mad ideas!  He would cheerfully have given\r\nhis life for her.  Only last night he was prepared to kill, which was\r\nworse than to die, for her sake.  And now to be far away, unable to help,\r\nunable even to know how she fared.  And behind her eternally the shadow\r\nof that worthless man who had spurned her love and flouted her to a\r\nchance comer in his drunken delirium.  It was too bitter to bear.  How\r\ncould God lightly lay such a burden on his shoulders who had all his life\r\ntried to walk in sobriety and chastity and in all worthy and manly ways!\r\nIt was unfair!  It was unfair!  If he could do anything for her?\r\nAnything!  Anything! . . . And so the unending whirl of thoughts went on!\r\n\r\nThe smoke of London was dim on the horizon when he began to get back to\r\npractical matters.  When the train drew up at Euston he stepped from it\r\nas one to whom death would be a joyous relief!\r\n\r\nHe went to a quiet hotel, and from there transacted by letter such\r\nbusiness matters as were necessary to save pain and trouble to others.  As\r\nfor himself, he made up his mind that he would go to Alaska, which he\r\ntook to be one of the best places in the as yet uncivilised world for a\r\nman to lose his identity.  As a security at the start he changed his\r\nname; and as John Robinson, which was not a name to attract public\r\nattention, he shipped as a passenger on the _Scoriac_ from London to New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThe _Scoriac_ was one of the great cargo boats which take a certain\r\nnumber of passengers.  The few necessaries which he took with him were\r\nchosen with an eye to utility in that frozen land which he sought.  For\r\nthe rest, he knew nothing, nor did he care how or whither he went.  His\r\nvague purpose was to cross the American Continent to San Francisco, and\r\nthere to take passage for the high latitudes north of the Yukon River.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nWhen Stephen began to regain consciousness her first sensation was one of\r\nnumbness.  She was cold in the back, and her feet did not seem to exist;\r\nbut her head was hot and pulsating as though her brain were a living\r\nthing.  Then her half-open eyes began to take in her surroundings.  For\r\nanother long spell she began to wonder why all around her was green.  Then\r\ncame the inevitable process of reason.  Trees!  It is a wood!  How did I\r\ncome here? why am I lying on the ground?\r\n\r\nAll at once wakened memory opened on her its flood-gates, and overwhelmed\r\nher with pain.  With her hands pressed to her throbbing temples and her\r\nburning face close to the ground, she began to recall what she could of\r\nthe immediate past.  It all seemed like a terrible dream.  By degrees her\r\nintelligence came back to its normal strength, and all at once, as does\r\none suddenly wakened from sleep to the knowledge of danger, she sat up.\r\n\r\nSomehow the sense of time elapsed made Stephen look at her watch.  It was\r\nhalf-past twelve.  As she had come into the grove immediately after\r\nbreakfast, and as Harold had almost immediately joined her, and as the\r\ninterview between them had been but short, she must have lain on the\r\nground for more than three hours.  She rose at once, trembling in every\r\nlimb.  A new fear began to assail her; that she had been missed at home,\r\nand that some one might have come to look for her.  Up to now she had not\r\nbeen able to feel the full measure of pain regarding what had passed, but\r\nwhich would, she knew, come to her in the end.  It was too vague as yet;\r\nshe could not realise that it had really been.  But the fear of discovery\r\nwas immediate, and must be guarded against without delay.  As well as she\r\ncould, she tidied herself and began to walk slowly back to the house,\r\nhoping to gain her own room unnoticed.  That her general intelligence was\r\nawake was shown by the fact that before she left the grove she remembered\r\nthat she had forgotten her sunshade.  She went back and searched till she\r\nhad found it.\r\n\r\nGaining her room without meeting any one, she at once change her dress,\r\nfearing that some soil or wrinkle might betray her.  Resolutely she put\r\nback from her mind all consideration of the past; there would be time for\r\nthat later on.  Her nerves were already much quieter than they had been.\r\nThat long faint, or lapse into insensibility, had for the time taken the\r\nplace of sleep.  There would be a price to be paid for it later; but for\r\nthe present it had served its purpose.  Now and again she was disturbed\r\nby one thought; she could not quite remember what had occurred after\r\nHarold had left, and just before she became unconscious.  She dared not\r\ndwell upon it, however.  It would doubtless all come back to her when she\r\nhad leisure to think the whole matter over as a connected narrative.\r\n\r\nWhen the gong sounded for lunch she went down, with a calm exterior, to\r\nface the dreaded ordeal of another meal.\r\n\r\nLuncheon passed off without a hitch.  She and her aunt talked as usual\r\nover all the small affairs of the house and the neighbourhood, and the\r\ncalm restraint was in itself soothing.  Even then she could not help\r\nfeeling how much convention is to a woman's life.  Had it not been for\r\nthese recurring trials of set hours and duties she could never have\r\npassed the last day and night without discovery of her condition of mind.\r\nThat one terrible, hysterical outburst was perhaps the safety valve.  Had\r\nit been spread over the time occupied in conventional duties its force\r\neven then might have betrayed her; but without the necessity of nerving\r\nherself to conventional needs, she would have infallibly betrayed herself\r\nby her negative condition.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch she went to her own boudoir where, when she had shut the\r\ninner door, no one was allowed to disturb her without some special need\r\nin the house or on the arrival of visitors.  This 'sporting oak' was the\r\nsign of 'not at home' which she had learned in her glimpse of college\r\nlife.  Here in the solitude of safety, she began to go over the past,\r\nresolutely and systematically.\r\n\r\nShe had already been so often over the memory of the previous humiliating\r\nand unhappy day that she need not revert to it at present.  Since then\r\nhad she not quarrelled with Harold, whom she had all her life so trusted\r\nthat her quarrel with him seemed to shake the very foundations of her\r\nexistence?  As yet she had not remembered perfectly all that had gone on\r\nunder the shadow of the beech grove.  She dared not face it all at once,\r\neven as yet.  Time must elapse before she should dare to cry; to think of\r\nher loss of Harold was to risk breaking down altogether.  Already she\r\nfelt weak.  The strain of the last forty-eight hours was too much for her\r\nphysical strength.  She began to feel, as she lay back in her cushioned\r\nchair, that a swoon is no worthy substitute for sleep.  Indeed it had\r\nseemed to make the need for sleep even more imperative.\r\n\r\nIt was all too humiliating!  She wanted to think over what had been; to\r\nrecall it as far as possible so as to fix it in her mind, whilst it was\r\nstill fresh.  Later on, some action might have to be based on her\r\nrecollection.  And yet . . . How could she think when she was so tired\r\n. . . tired . . .\r\n\r\nNature came to the poor girl's relief at last, and she fell into a heavy\r\nsleep . . .\r\n\r\nIt was like coming out of the grave to be dragged back to waking life out\r\nof such a sleep, and so soon after it had begun.  But the voice seemed to\r\nreach to her inner consciousness in some compelling way.  For a second\r\nshe could not understand; but as she rose from the cushions the maid's\r\nmessage repeated, brought her wide awake and alert in an instant:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Everard, young Mr. Everard, to see you, miss!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI--A PRIVATE CONVERSATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name braced Stephen at once.  Here was danger, an enemy to be\r\nencountered; all the fighting blood of generations leaped to the\r\noccasion.  The short spell of sleep had helped to restore her.  There\r\nremained still quite enough of mental and nervous excitement to make her\r\nthink quickly; the words were hardly out of the maid's mouth before her\r\nresolution was taken.  It would never do to let Leonard Everard see she\r\nwas diffident about meeting him; she would go down at once.  But she\r\nwould take the precaution of having her aunt present; at any rate, till\r\nshe should have seen how the land lay.  Her being just waked from sleep\r\nwould be an excuse for asking her aunt to see the visitor till she came\r\ndown.  So she said to the maid:\r\n\r\n'I have been asleep.  I must have got tired walking in the wood in the\r\nheat.  Ask Auntie to kindly see Mr. Everard in the blue drawing-room till\r\nI come down.  I must tidy my hair; but I will be down in a few minutes.'\r\n\r\n'Shall I send Marjorie to you, miss?'\r\n\r\n'No!  Don't mind; I can do what I want myself.  Hurry down to Miss\r\nRowly!'\r\n\r\nHow she regarded Leonard Everard now was shown in her instinctive\r\nclassing him amongst her enemies.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered the room she seemed all aglow.  She wanted not only to\r\novercome but to punish; and all the woman in her had risen to the effort.\r\nNever in her life had Stephen Norman looked more radiantly beautiful,\r\nmore adorable, more desirable.  Even Leonard Everard felt his pulses\r\nquicken as he saw that glowing mass of beauty standing out against the\r\ncold background of old French tapestry.  All the physical side of him\r\nleaped in answer to the call of her beauty; and even his cold heart and\r\nhis self-engrossed brain followed with slower gait.  He had been sitting\r\nopposite Miss Rowly in one of the windows, twirling his hat in nervous\r\nsuspense.  He jumped up, and, as she came towards him, went forward\r\nrapidly to greet her.  No one could mistake the admiration in his eyes.\r\nEver since he had made up his mind to marry her she had assumed a new\r\naspect in his thoughts.  But now her presence swept away all false\r\nimaginings; from the moment that her loveliness dawned upon him something\r\nlike love began to grow within his breast.  Stephen saw the look and it\r\nstrengthened her.  He had so grievously wounded her pride the previous\r\nday that her victory on this was a compensation which set her more at her\r\nold poise.\r\n\r\nHer greeting was all sweetness: she was charmed to see him.  How was his\r\nfather, and what was the news?  Miss Rowly looked on with smiling visage.\r\nShe too had seen the look of admiration in his eyes, and it pleased her.\r\nOld ladies, especially when they are maiden ladies, always like to see\r\nadmiration in the eyes of young men when they are turned in the direction\r\nof any girl dear to them.\r\n\r\nThey talked for some time, keeping all the while, by Stephen's clever\r\ngeneralship, to the small-talk of the neighbourhood and the minor events\r\nof social importance.  As the time wore on she could see that Leonard was\r\ngrowing impatient, and evidently wanted to see her alone.  She ignored,\r\nhowever, all his little private signalling, and presently ordered tea to\r\nbe brought.  This took some little time; when it had been brought and\r\nserved and drunk, Leonard was in a smothered fume of impatience.  She was\r\nglad to see that as yet her aunt had noticed nothing, and she still hoped\r\nthat she would be able to so prolong matters, that she would escape\r\nwithout a private interview.  She did not know the cause of Leonard's\r\nimpatience: that he must see her before the day passed.  She too was an\r\negoist, in her own way; in the flush of belief of his subjugation she did\r\nnot think of attributing to him any other motive than his desire for\r\nherself.  As she had made up her mind on the final issue she did not want\r\nto be troubled by a new 'scene.'\r\n\r\nBut, after all, Leonard was a man; and man's ways are more direct than\r\nwoman's.  Seeing that he could not achieve his object in any other way,\r\nhe said out suddenly, thinking, and rightly, that she would not wish to\r\nforce an issue in the presence of her aunt:\r\n\r\n'By the way, Miss Norman,' he had always called her 'Miss Norman' in her\r\naunt's presence: 'I want to have two minutes with you before I go.  On a\r\nmatter of business,' he added, noticing Miss Rowly's surprised look.  The\r\nold lady was old-fashioned even for her age; in her time no young man\r\nwould have asked to see a young lady alone on business.  Except on one\r\nkind of business; and with regard to that kind of business gentlemen had\r\nto obtain first the confidence and permission of guardians.  Leonard saw\r\nthe difficulty and said quickly:\r\n\r\n'It is on the matter you wrote to me about!'\r\n\r\nStephen was prepared for a nasty shock, but hardly for so nasty a one as\r\nthis.  There was an indelicacy about it which went far beyond the bounds\r\nof thoughtless conventionality.  That such an appeal should be made to\r\nher, and in such a way, savoured of danger.  Her woman's intuition gave\r\nher the guard, and at once she spoke, smilingly and gently as one\r\nrecalling a matter in which the concern is not her own:\r\n\r\n'Of course!  It was selfish of me not to have thought of it, and to have\r\nkept you so long waiting.  The fact is, Auntie, that Leonard--I like to\r\ncall him Leonard, since we were children together, and he is so young;\r\nthough perhaps it would be more decorous nowadays to say \"Mr.\r\nEverard\"--has consulted me about his debts.  You know, Auntie dear, that\r\nyoung men will be young men in such matters; or perhaps you do not, since\r\nthe only person who ever worried you has been myself.  But I stayed at\r\nOxford and I know something of young men's ways; and as I am necessarily\r\nmore or less of a man of business, he values my help.  Don't you,\r\nLeonard?'  The challenge was so direct, and the position he was in so\r\ndaringly put, that he had to acquiesce.  Miss Rowly, who had looked on\r\nwith a frown of displeasure, said coldly:\r\n\r\n'I know you are your own mistress, my dear.  But surely it would be\r\nbetter if Mr. Everard would consult with his solicitor or his father's\r\nagent, or some of his gentlemen friends, rather than with a young lady\r\nwhose relations with him, after all, are only those of a neighbour on\r\nvisiting terms.  For my own part, I should have thought that Mr.\r\nEverard's best course would have been to consult his own father!  But the\r\nthings that gentlemen, as well as ladies do, have been sadly changed\r\nsince my time!'  Then, rising in formal dignity, she bowed gravely to the\r\nvisitor before leaving the room.\r\n\r\nBut the position of being left alone in the room with Leonard did not at\r\nall suit Stephen's plans.  Rising quickly she said to her aunt:\r\n\r\n'Don't stir, Auntie.  I dare say you are right in what you say; but I\r\npromised Mr. Everard to go into the matter.  And as I have brought the\r\nawkwardness on myself, I suppose I must bear it.  If Mr. Everard wants to\r\nsee me alone, and I suppose he is diffident in speaking on such a matter\r\nbefore you--he didn't play with you, you know!--we can go out on the\r\nlawn.  We shan't be long!'  Before Leonard could recover his wits she had\r\nheaded him out on the lawn.\r\n\r\nHer strategy was again thoroughly good.  The spot she chose, though\r\nbeyond earshot, was quite in the open and commanded by all the windows in\r\nthat side of the house.  A person speaking there might say what he liked,\r\nbut his actions must be discreet.\r\n\r\nOn the lawn Stephen tripped ahead; Leonard followed inwardly raging.  By\r\nher clever use of the opening she had put him in a difficulty from which\r\nthere was no immediate means of extrication.  He could not quarrel\r\novertly with Stephen; if he did so, how could he enter on the pressing\r\nmatter of his debts?  He dared not openly proclaim his object in wishing\r\nto marry her, for had he done so her aunt might have interfered, with\r\nwhat success he could not be sure.  In any case it would cause delay, and\r\ndelay was what he could not afford.  He felt that in mentioning his debts\r\nat just such a movement he had given Stephen the chance she had so aptly\r\ntaken.  He had to be on his good behaviour, however; and with an\r\napprehension that was new to him he followed her.\r\n\r\nAn old Roman marble seat was placed at an angle from the house so that\r\nthe one of the two occupants within its curve must almost face the house,\r\nwhilst the other gave to it at least a quarter-face.  Stephen seated\r\nherself on the near side, leaving to Leonard the exposed position.  As\r\nsoon as he was seated, she began:\r\n\r\n'Now, Leonard, tell me all about the debts?'  She spoke in tones of gay\r\nfriendliness, but behind the mask of her cheerfulness was the real face\r\nof fear.  Down deep in her mind was a conviction that her letter was a\r\npivotal point of future sorrow.  It was in the meantime quite apparent to\r\nher that Leonard kept it as his last resource; so her instinct was to\r\nkeep it to the front and thus minimise its power.\r\n\r\nLeonard, though inwardly weakened by qualms of growing doubt, had the\r\nanimal instinct that, as he was in opposition, his safety was in\r\nattacking where his opponent most feared.  He felt that there was some\r\nsubtle change in his companion; this was never the same Stephen Norman\r\nwhom only yesterday he had met upon the hill!  He plunged at once into\r\nhis purpose.\r\n\r\n'But it wasn't about my debts you asked me to meet you, Stephen.'\r\n\r\n'You surprise me, Leonard!  I thought I simply asked you to come to meet\r\nme.  I know the first subject I mentioned when we began to talk, after\r\nyour grumbling about coming in the heat, was your money matters.'  Leonard\r\nwinced, but went on:\r\n\r\n'It was very good of you, Stephen; but really that is not what I came to\r\nspeak of to-day.  At first, at all events!' he added with a sublime\r\nnaivette, as the subject of his debts and his imperative want of money\r\nrose before him.  Stephen's eyes flashed; she saw more clearly than ever\r\nthrough his purpose.  Such as admission at the very outset of the proffer\r\nof marriage, which she felt was coming, was little short of monstrous.\r\nHer companion did not see the look of mastery on her face; he was looking\r\ndown at the moment.  A true lover would have been looking up.\r\n\r\n'I wanted to tell you, Stephen, that I have been thinking over what you\r\nsaid to me in your letter, and what you said in words; and I want to\r\naccept!'  As he was speaking he was looking her straight in the face.\r\n\r\nStephen answered slowly with a puzzled smile which wrinkled up her\r\nforehead:\r\n\r\n'Accept what I said in my letter! why, Leonard, what do you mean?  That\r\nletter must have had a lot more in it than I thought.  I seem to remember\r\nthat it was simply a line asking you to meet me.  Just let me look at it;\r\nI should like to be sure of what actually is!'  As she spoke she held out\r\nher hand.  Leonard was nonplussed; he did not know what to say.  Stephen\r\nmade up her mind to have the letter back.  Leonard was chafing under the\r\nposition forced upon him, and tried to divert his companion from her\r\npurpose.  He knew well why she had chosen that exposed position for their\r\ninterview.  Now, as her outstretched hand embarrassed him, he made\r\nreprisal; he tried to take it in his in a tender manner.\r\n\r\nShe instantly drew back her hand and put it behind her in a decided\r\nmanner.  She was determined that whatever might happen she would not let\r\nany watcher at the windows, by chance or otherwise, see any sign of\r\ntenderness on her part.  Leonard, thinking that his purpose had been\r\neffected, went on, breathing more freely:\r\n\r\n'Your letter wasn't much.  Except of course that it gave me the\r\nopportunity of listening to what you said; to all your sweet words.  To\r\nyour more than sweet proposal!'\r\n\r\n'Yes!  It must have been sweet to have any one, who was in a position to\r\ndo so, offer to help you when you knew that you were overwhelmed with\r\ndebts!'  The words were brutal.  Stephen felt so; but she had no\r\nalternative.  Leonard had some of the hard side of human nature; but he\r\nhad also some of the weak side.  He went on blindly:\r\n\r\n'I have been thinking ever since of what you said, and I want to tell you\r\nthat I would like to do as you wish!'  As he spoke, his words seemed even\r\nto him to be out of place.  He felt it would be necessary to throw more\r\nfervour into the proceedings.  The sudden outburst which followed\r\nactually amused Stephen, even in her state of fear:\r\n\r\n'Oh, Stephen, don't you know that I love you!  You are so beautiful!  I\r\nlove you!  I love you!  Won't you be my wife?'\r\n\r\nThis was getting too much to close quarters.  Stephen said in a calm,\r\nbusiness-like way:\r\n\r\n'My dear Leonard, one thing at a time!  I came out here, you know, to\r\nspeak of your debts; and until that is done, I really won't go into any\r\nother matter.  Of course if you'd rather not . . . '  Leonard really\r\ncould not afford this; matters were too pressing with him.  So he tried\r\nto affect a cheery manner; but in his heart was a black resolve that she\r\nshould yet pay for this.\r\n\r\n'All right! Stephen.  Whatever you wish I will do; you are the queen of\r\nmy heart, you know!'\r\n\r\n'How much is the total amount?' said Stephen.\r\n\r\nThis was a change to the prosaic which made sentiment impossible.  He\r\ngave over, for the time.\r\n\r\n'Go on!' said Stephen, following up her advantage.  'Don't you even know\r\nhow much you owe?'\r\n\r\n'The fact is, I don't.  Not exactly.  I shall make up the amount as well\r\nas I can and let you know.  But that's not what I came about to-day.'\r\nStephen was going to make an angry gesture of dissent.  She was not going\r\nto have that matter opened up.  She waited, however, for Leonard was\r\ngoing on after his momentary pause.  She breathed more freely after his\r\nfirst sentence.  He was unable evidently to carry on a double train of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n'It was about that infernal money-lenders' letter that the Governor got!'\r\nStephen got still less anxious.  This open acknowledgment of his true\r\npurpose seemed to clear the air.\r\n\r\n'What is the amount?'  Leonard looked quickly at her; the relief of her\r\nmind made her tone seem joyful.\r\n\r\n'A monkey!  Five hundred pounds, you know.  But then there's three\r\nhundred for interest that has to be paid also.  It's an awful lot of\r\nmoney, isn't it?'  The last phrase was added on seeing Stephen's\r\nsurprised look.\r\n\r\n'Yes!' she answered quietly.  'A great deal of money--to waste!'  They\r\nwere both silent for a while.  Then she said:\r\n\r\n'What does your father say to it?'\r\n\r\n'He was in an awful wax.  One of these beastly duns had written to him\r\nabout another account and he was in a regular fury.  When I told him I\r\nwould pay it within a week, he said very little, which was suspicious;\r\nand then, just when I was going out, he sprung this on me.  Mean of him!\r\nwasn't it?  I need expect no help from him.'  As he was speaking he took\r\na mass of letters from his pocket and began to look among them for the\r\nmoney-lenders' letter.\r\n\r\n'Why, what a correspondence you have there.  Do you keep all your letters\r\nin your pockets?' said Stephen quietly.\r\n\r\n'All I don't tear up or burn.  It wouldn't do to let the Governor into my\r\nsecrets.  He might know too much!'\r\n\r\n'And are all those letters from duns?'\r\n\r\n'Mostly, but I only keep those letters I have to attend to and those I\r\ncare for.'\r\n\r\n'Show me the bundle!' she said.  Then seeing him hesitate, added:\r\n\r\n'You know if I am to help you to get clear you must take me into your\r\nconfidence.  I dare say I shall have to see a lot more letters than these\r\nbefore you are quite clear!'  Her tone was too quiet.  Knowing already\r\nthe silent antagonism between them he began to suspect her; knowing also\r\nthat her own letter was not amongst them, he used his wits and handed\r\nthem over without a word.  She, too, suspected him.  After his tacit\r\nrefusal to give her the letter, she almost took it for granted that it\r\nwas not amongst them.  She gave no evidence of her feeling, however, but\r\nopened and read the letters in due sequence; all save two, which, being\r\nin a female hand, she gave back without a word.  There was a calmness and\r\nan utter absence of concern, much less of jealousy, about this which\r\ndisconcerted him.  Throughout her reading Stephen's face showed surprise\r\nnow and again; but when she came to the last, which was that of the\r\nusurers, it showed alarm.  Being a woman, a legal threat had certain\r\nfears of its own.\r\n\r\n'There must be no delay about this!' she said.\r\n\r\n'What am I to do?' he answered, a weight off his mind that the fiscal\r\nmatter had been practically entered on.\r\n\r\n'I shall see that you get the money!' she said quietly.  'It will be\r\nreally a gift, but I prefer it to be as a loan for many reasons.'  Leonard\r\nmade no comment.   He found so many reasons in his own mind that he\r\nthought it wise to forbear from asking any of hers.  Then she took the\r\npractical matter in hand:\r\n\r\n'You must wire to these people at once to say that you will pay the\r\namount on the day after to-morrow.  If you will come here to-morrow at\r\nfour o'clock the money will be ready for you.  You can go up to town by\r\nthe evening train and pay off the debt first thing in the morning.  When\r\nyou bring the receipt I shall speak to you about the other debts; but you\r\nmust make out a full list of them.  We can't have any half-measure.  I\r\nwill not go into the matter till I have all the details before me!'  Then\r\nshe stood up to go.\r\n\r\nAs they walked across the lawn, she said:\r\n\r\n'By the way, don't forget to bring that letter with you.  I want to see\r\nwhat I really did say in it!'  Her tone was quiet enough, and the wording\r\nwas a request; but Leonard knew as well as if it had been spoken outright\r\nas a threat that if he did not have the letter with him when he came\r\nthings were likely to be unpleasant.\r\n\r\nThe farther he got from Normanstand on his way home the more discontented\r\nLeonard grew.  Whilst he had been in Stephen's presence she had so\r\ndominated him, not only by her personality but by her use of her\r\nknowledge of his own circumstances, that he had not dared to make protest\r\nor opposition; but now he began to feel how much less he was to receive\r\nthan he had expected.  He had come prepared to allow Stephen to fall into\r\nhis arms, fortune and all.  But now, although he had practical assurance\r\nthat the weight of his debts would be taken from him, he was going away\r\nwith his tail between his legs.  He had not even been accepted as a\r\nsuitor, he who had himself been wooed only a day before.  His proposal of\r\nmarriage had not been accepted, had not even been considered by the woman\r\nwho had so lately broken ironclad convention to propose marriage to him.\r\nHe had been treated merely as a scapegrace debtor who had come to ask\r\nfavours from an old friend.  He had even been treated like a bad boy; had\r\nbeen told that he had wasted money; had been ordered, in no doubtful way,\r\nto bring the full schedule of his debts.  And all the time he dared not\r\nsay anything lest the thing shouldn't come off at all.  Stephen had such\r\nan infernally masterly way with her!  It didn't matter whether she was\r\nproposing to him, or he was proposing to her, he was made to feel small\r\nall the same.  He would have to put up with it till he had got rid of the\r\ndebts!\r\n\r\nAnd then as to the letter.  Why was she so persistent about seeing it?\r\nDid she want to get it into her hands and then keep it, as Harold An Wolf\r\nhad done?  Was it possible that she suspected he would use it to coerce\r\nher; she would call it 'blackmail,' he supposed.  This being the very\r\nthing he had intended to do, and had done, he grew very indignant at the\r\nvery thought of being accused of it.  It was, he felt, a very awkward\r\nthing that he had lost possession of the letter.  He might need it if\r\nStephen got nasty.  Then Harold might give it to her, as he had\r\nthreatened to do.  He thought he would call round that evening by\r\nHarold's house, and see if he couldn't get back the letter.  It belonged\r\nto him; Harold had no right to keep it.  He would see him before he and\r\nStephen got putting their heads together.  So, on his way home, he turned\r\nhis steps at once to Harold's house.\r\n\r\nHe did not find him in.  The maid who opened the door could give him no\r\ninformation; all she could say was that Mrs. Dingle the housekeeper had\r\ngot a telegram from Master saying that he had been called suddenly away\r\non business.\r\n\r\nThis was a new source of concern to Leonard.  He suspected a motive of\r\nsome sort; though what that motive could be he could not hazard the\r\nwildest guess.  On his way home he called at the post-office and sent a\r\ntelegram to Cavendish and Cecil, the name of the usurers' firm, in\r\naccordance with Stephen's direction.  He signed it: 'Jasper Everard.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII--A BUSINESS TRANSACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Stephen had sent off her letter to the bank she went out for a\r\nstroll; she knew it would be no use trying to get rest before dinner.\r\nThat ordeal, too, had to be gone through.  She found herself\r\nunconsciously going in the direction of the grove; but when she became\r\naware of it a great revulsion overcame her, and she shuddered.\r\n\r\nSlowly she took her way across the hard stretch of finely-kept grass\r\nwhich lay on the side of the house away from the wood.  The green sward\r\nlay like a sea, dotted with huge trees, singly, or in clumps as islands.\r\nIn its far-stretching stateliness there was something soothing.  She came\r\nback to the sound of the dressing-gong with a better strength to resist\r\nthe trial before her.  Well she knew her aunt would have something to say\r\non the subject of her interference in Leonard Everard's affairs.\r\n\r\nHer fears were justified, for when they had come into the drawing-room\r\nafter dinner Miss Rowly began:\r\n\r\n'Stephen dear, is it not unwise of you to interfere in Mr. Everard's\r\naffairs?'\r\n\r\n'Why unwise, Auntie?'\r\n\r\n'Well, my dear, the world is censorious.  And when a young lady, of your\r\nposition and your wealth, takes a part in a young man's affairs tongues\r\nare apt to wag.  And also, dear, debts, young men's debts, are hardly the\r\nsubjects for a girl's investigation.  Remember, that we ladies live very\r\ndifferent lives from men; from some men, I should say, for your dear\r\nfather was the best of men, and I should think that in all his life there\r\nwas nothing which he would have wished concealed.  But, my dear, young\r\nmen are less restrained in their ways than we are, than we have to be for\r\nour own safety and protection.'  The poor lady was greatly perturbed at\r\nhaving to speak in such a way.  Stephen saw her distress; coming over to\r\nher, she sat down and took her hand.  Stephen had a very tender side to\r\nher nature, and she loved very truly the dear old lady who had taken her\r\nmother's place and had shown her all a mother's love.  Now, in her\r\nloneliness and woe and fear, she clung to her in spirit.  She would have\r\nliked to have clung to her physically; to have laid her head on her\r\nbosom, and have cried her heart out.  The time for tears had not come.\r\nHourly she felt more and more the weight that a shameful secret is to\r\ncarry.  She knew, however, that she could set her aunt's mind at rest on\r\nthe present subject; so she said:\r\n\r\n'I think you are right, Auntie dear.  It would have been better if I had\r\nasked you first; but I saw that Leonard was in distress, and wormed the\r\ncause of it from him.  When I heard that it was only debt I offered to\r\nhelp him.  He is an old friend, you know, Auntie.  We were children\r\ntogether; and as I have much more money than I can ever want or spend, I\r\nthought I might help him.  I am afraid I have let myself in for a bigger\r\nthing than I intended; but as I have promised I must go on with it.  I\r\ndare say, Auntie, that you are afraid that I may end by getting in love\r\nwith him, and marrying him.  Don't you, dear?'  This was said with a hug\r\nand a kiss which gave the old lady delight.  Her instinct told her what\r\nwas coming.  She nodded her head in acquiescence.  Stephen went on\r\ngravely:\r\n\r\n'Put any such fear out of your mind.  I shall never marry him.  I can\r\nnever love him.'  She was going to say 'could never love him,' when she\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\n'Are you sure, my dear?  The heart is not always under one's own\r\ncontrol.'\r\n\r\n'Quite sure, Auntie.  I know Leonard Everard; and though I have always\r\nliked him, I do not respect him.  Why, the very fact of his coming to me\r\nfor money would make me reconsider any view I had formed, had nothing\r\nelse ever done so.  You may take it, Auntie dear, that in the way you\r\nmean Leonard is nothing to me; can never be anything to me!'  Here a\r\nsudden inspiration took her.  In its light a serious difficulty passed,\r\nand the doing of a thing which had a fear of its own became easy.  With a\r\nconviction in her tone, which in itself aided her immediate purpose, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'I shall prove it to you.  That is, if you will not mind doing something\r\nwhich will save me an embarrassment.'\r\n\r\n'You know I will do anything, my dearest, which an old woman can do for a\r\nyoung one!'  Stephen squeezed the mittened hand which she held as she\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n'As I said, I have promised to lend him some money.  The first instalment\r\nis to be given him to-morrow; he is to call for it in the afternoon.  Will\r\nyou give it to him for me?'\r\n\r\n'Gladly, my dear,' said the old lady, much relieved.  Stephen continued:\r\n\r\n'One other thing, Auntie, I want you to do for me: not to think of the\r\namount, or to say a word to me about it.  It is a large sum, and I dare\r\nsay it will frighten you a little.  But I have made up my mind to it.  I\r\nam learning a great deal out of this, Auntie dear; and I am quite willing\r\nto pay for my knowledge.  After all, money is the easiest and cheapest\r\nway of paying for knowledge!  Don't you agree with me?'\r\n\r\nMiss Rowly gulped down her disappointment.  She felt that she ought not\r\nto say too much, now that Stephen had set aside her graver fears.  She\r\nconsoled herself with the thought that even a large amount of money would\r\ncause no inconvenience to so wealthy a woman as Stephen.  Beyond this, as\r\nshe would have the handing over of the money to Leonard, she would know\r\nthe amount.  If advisable, she could remonstrate.  She could if necessary\r\nconsult, in confidence, with Harold.  Her relief from her greater fear,\r\nand her gladness at this new proof of her niece's confidence, were\r\nmanifested in the extra affection with which she bade her good-night.\r\n\r\nStephen did not dare to breathe freely till she was quite alone; and as\r\nshe lay quiet in her bed in the dark she thought before sleep came.\r\n\r\nHer first feeling was one of thankfulness that immediate danger was\r\nswerving from her.  Things were so shaping themselves that she need not\r\nhave any fear concerning Leonard.  For his own sake he would have to keep\r\nsilent.  If he intended to blackmail her she would have the protection of\r\nher aunt's knowledge of the loan, and of her participation in it.  The\r\nonly weapon that remained to him was her letter; and that she would get\r\nfrom him before furnishing the money for the payment of his other debts.\r\n\r\nThese things out of the way, her thoughts turned to the matter of the\r\ngreater dread; that of which all along she had feared to think for a\r\nmoment: Harold!\r\n\r\nHarold! and her treatment of him!\r\n\r\nThe first reception of the idea was positive anguish.  From the moment he\r\nhad left her till now there had been no time when a consideration of the\r\nmatter was possible.  Time pressed, or circumstances had interfered, or\r\nher own personal condition had forbidden.  Now, when she was alone, the\r\nwhole awful truth burst on her like an avalanche.  Stephen felt the issue\r\nof her thinking before the thinking itself was accomplished; and it was\r\nwith a smothered groan that she, in the darkness, held up her arms with\r\nfingers linked in desperate concentration of appeal.\r\n\r\nOh, if she could only take back one hour of her life, well she knew what\r\nthat hour would be!  Even that shameful time with Leonard on the hill-top\r\nseemed innocuous beside the degrading remembrance of her conduct to the\r\nnoble friend of her whole life.\r\n\r\nSadly she turned over in her bed, and with shut eyes put her burning face\r\non the pillow, to hide, as it were, from herself her abject depth of\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nLeonard lounged through the next morning with what patience he could.  At\r\nfour o'clock he was at the door of Normanstand in his dogcart.  This time\r\nhe had a groom with him and a suitcase packed for a night's use, as he\r\nwas to go on to London after his interview with Stephen.  He had lost\r\nsight altogether of the matter of Stephen's letter, or else he would have\r\nbeen more nervous.\r\n\r\nHe was taken into the blue drawing-room, where shortly Miss Rowly joined\r\nhim.  He had not expected this.  His mental uneasiness manifested itself\r\nin his manner, and his fidgeting was not unobserved by the astute old\r\nlady.  He was disconcerted; 'overwhelmed' would better have described his\r\nfeelings when she said:\r\n\r\n'Miss Norman is sorry she can't see you to-day as she is making a visit;\r\nbut she has given me a message for you, or rather a commission to\r\ndischarge.  Perhaps you had better sit down at the table; there are\r\nwriting materials there, and I shall want a receipt of some sort.'\r\n\r\n'Stephen did not say anything about a receipt!'  The other smiled sweetly\r\nas she said in a calm way:\r\n\r\n'But unfortunately Miss Norman is not here; and so I have to do the best\r\nI can.  I really must have some proof that I have fulfilled my trust.  You\r\nsee, Mr. Everard, though it is what lawyers call a \"friendly\"\r\ntransaction, it is more or less a business act; and I must protect\r\nmyself.'\r\n\r\nLeonard saw that he must comply, for time pressed.  He sat down at the\r\ntable.  Taking up a pen and drawing a sheet of paper towards him, he said\r\nwith what command of his voice he could:\r\n\r\n'What am I to write?'  The old lady took from her basket a folded sheet\r\nof notepaper, and, putting on her reading-glasses, said as she smoothed\r\nit out:\r\n\r\n'I think it would be well to say something like this--\"I, Leonard\r\nEverard, of Brindehow, in the Parish of Normanstand, in the County of\r\nNorcester, hereby acknowledge the receipt from Miss Laetitia Rowly of\r\nnine hundred pounds sterling lent to me in accordance with my request,\r\nthe same being to clear me of a pressing debt due by me.'\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished writing the receipt Miss Rowly looked it over, and\r\nhanding it back to him, said:\r\n\r\n'Now sign; and date!'  He did so with suppressed anger.\r\n\r\nShe folded the document carefully and put it in her pocket.  Then taking\r\nfrom the little pouch which she wore at her belt a roll of notes, she\r\ncounted out on the table nine notes of one hundred pounds each.  As she\r\nput down the last she said:\r\n\r\n'Miss Norman asked me to say that a hundred pounds is added to the sum\r\nyou specified to her, as doubtless the usurers would, since you are\r\nactually behind the time promised for repayment, require something extra\r\nas a solatium or to avoid legal proceedings already undertaken.  In fact\r\nthat they would \"put more salt on your tail.\"  The expression, I regret\r\nto say, is not mine.'\r\n\r\nLeonard folded up the notes, put them into his pocket-book, and walked\r\naway.  He did not feel like adding verbal thanks to the document already\r\nsigned.  As he got near the door the thought struck him; turning back he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'May I ask if Stephen said anything about getting the document?'\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon,' she said icily, 'did you speak of any one?'\r\n\r\n'Miss Norman, I meant!'  Miss Rowly's answer to this came so smartly that\r\nit left an added sting.  Her arrow was fledged with two feathers so that\r\nit must shoot true: her distrust of him and his own impotence.\r\n\r\n'Oh no!  Miss Norman knows nothing of this.  She simply asked me to give\r\nyou the money.  This is my own doing entirely.  You see, I must exercise\r\nmy judgment on my dear niece's behalf.  Of course it may not be necessary\r\nto show her the receipt; but if it should ever be advisable it is always\r\nthere.'\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with anger, not unmixed with admiration, as, bowing\r\nrather lower than necessary, he went out of the door, saying sotto voce,\r\nbetween his teeth:\r\n\r\n'When my turn comes out you go!  Neck and crop!  Quick!  Normanstand\r\nisn't big enough to hold us both!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII--MORE BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Leonard tendered the eight hundred pounds in payment of his debt of\r\nfive hundred, Mr. Cavendish at first refused to take it.  But when\r\nLeonard calmly but firmly refused to pay a single penny beyond the\r\nobligations already incurred, including interest on the full sum for one\r\nday, he acquiesced.  He knew the type of man fully; and knew also that in\r\nall probability it would not be long before he would come to the Firm\r\nagain on a borrowing errand.  When such time should come, he would put an\r\nextra clause into his Memorandum of Agreement which would allow the Firm\r\nfull power to make whatever extra charge they might choose in case of the\r\nslightest default in making payment.\r\n\r\nLeonard's visits to town had not of late been many, and such as he had\r\nhad were not accompanied with a plethora of cash.  He now felt that he\r\nhad earned a holiday; and it was not till the third morning that he\r\nreturned to Brindehow.  His father made no comment on his absence; his\r\nonly allusion to the subject was:\r\n\r\n'Back all right!  Any news in town?'  There was, however, an unwonted\r\nsuavity in his manner which made Leonard a little anxious.  He busied\r\nhimself for the balance of the morning in getting together all his unpaid\r\naccounts and making a schedule of them.  The total at first amazed almost\r\nas much as it frightened him.  He feared what Stephen would say.  She had\r\nalready commented unfavourably on the one amount she had seen.  When she\r\nwas face to face with this she might refuse to pay altogether.  It would\r\ntherefore be wise to propitiate her.  What could he do in this direction?\r\nHis thoughts naturally turned to the missing letter.  If he could get\r\npossession of it, it would either serve as a sop or a threat.  In the one\r\ncase she would be so glad to have it back that she would not stick at a\r\nfew pounds; in the other it would 'bring her to her senses' as he put in\r\nhis own mind his intention of blackmail.\r\n\r\nHe was getting so tightened up in situation that as yet he could only do\r\nas he was told, and keep his temper as well as he could.\r\n\r\nAltogether it was in a chastened mood that he made his appearance at\r\nNormanstand later in the afternoon.  He was evidently expected, for he\r\nwas shown into the study without a word.  Here Miss Rowly and Stephen\r\njoined him.  Both were very kind in manner.  After the usual greetings\r\nand commonplaces Stephen said in a brisk, businesslike way:\r\n\r\n'Have you the papers with you?'  He took the bundle of accounts from his\r\npocket and handed them to her.  After his previous experience he would\r\nhave suggested, had he dared, that he should see Stephen alone; but he\r\nfeared the old lady.  He therefore merely said:\r\n\r\n'I am afraid you will find the amount very large.  But I have put down\r\neverything!'\r\n\r\nSo he had; and more than everything.  At the last an idea struck him that\r\nas he was getting so much he might as well have a little more.  He\r\ntherefore added several good-sized amounts which he called 'debts of\r\nhonour.'  This would, he thought, appeal to the feminine mind.  Stephen\r\ndid not look at the papers at once.  She stood up, holding them, and said\r\nto Miss Rowly:\r\n\r\n'Now, if you will talk to Mr. Everard I will go over these documents\r\nquietly by myself.  When I have been through them and understand them all\r\nI shall come back; and we will see what can be done.'  She moved\r\ngracefully out of the room, closing the door behind her.  As is usual\r\nwith women, she had more than one motive for her action in going away.  In\r\nthe first place, she wished to be alone whilst she went over the schedule\r\nof the debts.  She feared she might get angry; and in the present state\r\nof her mind towards Leonard the expression of any feeling, even contempt,\r\nwould not be wise.  Her best protection from him would be a manifest\r\nkindly negation of any special interest.  In the second place, she\r\nbelieved that he would have her letter with the other papers, and she did\r\nnot wish her aunt to see it, lest she should recognise the writing.  In\r\nher boudoir, with a beating heart, she untied the string and looked\r\nthrough the papers.\r\n\r\nHer letter was not among them.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds she stood stock still, thinking.  Then, with a sigh,\r\nshe sat down and began to read the list of debts, turning to the\r\noriginals now and again for details.  As she went on, her wonder and\r\ndisgust grew; and even a sense of fear came into her thoughts.  A man who\r\ncould be so wildly reckless and so selfishly unscrupulous was to be\r\nfeared.  She knew his father was a comparatively poor man, who could not\r\npossibly meet such a burden.  If he were thus to his father, what might\r\nhe be to her if he got a chance.\r\n\r\nThe thought of what he might have been to her, had he taken the chance\r\nshe had given him, never occurred to her.  This possibility had already\r\nreached the historical stage in her mind.\r\n\r\nShe made a few pencil notes on the list; and went back to the study.  Her\r\nmind was made up.\r\n\r\nShe was quite businesslike and calm, did not manifest the slightest\r\ndisapproval, but seemed to simply accept everything as facts.  She asked\r\nLeonard a few questions on subjects regarding which she had made notes,\r\nsuch as discounts.  Then she held the paper out to him and without any\r\npreliminary remark said:\r\n\r\n'Will you please put the names to these?'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean?' he asked, flushing.\r\n\r\n'The names of the persons to whom these sums marked \"debt of honour\" are\r\ndue.'  His reply came quickly, and was a little aggressive; he thought\r\nthis might be a good time to make a bluff:\r\n\r\n'I do not see that that is necessary.  I can settle them when I have the\r\nmoney.'  Slowly and without either pause or flurry Stephen replied,\r\nlooking him straight in the eyes as she handed him the papers:\r\n\r\n'Of course it is not necessary!  Few things in the world really are!  I\r\nonly wanted to help you out of your troubles; but if you do not wish me\r\nto . . . !'  Leonard interrupted in alarm:\r\n\r\n'No! no!  I only spoke of these items.  You see, being \"debts of honour\"\r\nI ought not to give the names.'  Looking with a keen glance at her set\r\nface he saw she was obdurate; and, recognising his defeat, said as calmly\r\nas he could, for he felt raging:\r\n\r\n'All right!  Give me the paper!'  Bending over the table he wrote.  When\r\nshe took the paper, a look half surprised, half indignant, passed over\r\nher face.  Her watchful aunt saw it, and bending over looked also at the\r\npaper.  Then she too smiled bitterly.\r\n\r\nLeonard had printed in the names!  The feminine keenness of both women\r\nhad made his intention manifest.  He did not wish for the possibility of\r\nhis handwriting being recognised.  His punishment came quickly.  With a\r\ndazzling smile Stephen said to him:\r\n\r\n'But, Leonard, you have forgotten to put the addresses!'\r\n\r\n'Is that necessary?'\r\n\r\n'Of course it is!  Why, you silly, how is the money to be paid if there\r\nare no addresses?'\r\n\r\nLeonard felt like a rat in a trap; but he had no alternative.  So\r\nirritated was he, and so anxious to hide his irritation that, forgetting\r\nhis own caution, he wrote, not in printing characters but in his own\r\nhandwriting, addresses evolved from his own imagination.  Stephen's eyes\r\ntwinkled as he handed her the paper: he had given himself away all round.\r\n\r\nLeonard having done all that as yet had been required of him, felt that\r\nhe might now ask a further favour, so he said:\r\n\r\n'There is one of those bills which I have promised to pay by Monday.'\r\n\r\n'Promised?' said Stephen with wide-opened eyes.  She had no idea of\r\nsparing him, she remembered the printed names.  'Why, Leonard, I thought\r\nyou said you were unable to pay any of those debts?'\r\n\r\nAgain he had put himself in a false position.  He could not say that it\r\nwas to his father he had made the promise; for he had already told\r\nStephen that he had been afraid to tell him of his debts.  In his\r\ndesperation, for Miss Rowly's remorseless glasses were full on him, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'I thought I was justified in making the promise after what you said\r\nabout the pleasure it would be to help me.  You remember, that day on the\r\nhilltop?'\r\n\r\nIf he had wished to disconcert her he was mistaken; she had already\r\nthought over and over again of every form of embarrassment her unhappy\r\naction might bring on her at his hands.  She now said sweetly and calmly,\r\nso sweetly and so calmly that he, with knowledge of her secret, was\r\nalarmed:\r\n\r\n'But that was not a promise to pay.  If you will remember it was only an\r\noffer, which is a very different thing.  You did not accept it then!'  She\r\nwas herself somewhat desperate, or she would not have sailed so close to\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\n'Ah, but I accepted later!' he said quickly, feeling in his satisfaction\r\nin an epigrammatic answer a certain measure of victory.  He felt his\r\nmistake when she went on calmly:\r\n\r\n'Offers like that are not repeated.  They are but phantoms, after all.\r\nThey come at their own choice, when they do come; and they stay but the\r\nmeasure of a breath or two.  You cannot summon them!'  Leonard fell into\r\nthe current of the metaphor and answered:\r\n\r\n'I don't know that even that is impossible.  There are spells which call,\r\nand recall, even phantoms!'\r\n\r\n'Indeed!'  Stephen was anxious to find his purpose.\r\n\r\nLeonard felt that he was getting on, that he was again acquiring the\r\nupper hand; so he pushed on the metaphor, more and more satisfied with\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n'And it is wonderful how simple some spells, and these the most powerful,\r\ncan be.  A remembered phrase, the recollection of a pleasant meeting, the\r\nsmell of a forgotten flower, or the sight of a forgotten letter; any or\r\nall of these can, through memory, bring back the past.  And it is often\r\nin the past that the secret of the future lies!'\r\n\r\nMiss Rowly felt that something was going on before her which she could\r\nnot understand.  Anything of this man's saying which she could not fathom\r\nmust be at least dangerous; so she determined to spoil his purpose,\r\nwhatever it might be.\r\n\r\n'Dear me!  That is charmingly poetic!  Past and future; memory and the\r\nsmell of flowers; meetings and letters!  It is quite philosophy.  Do\r\nexplain it all, Mr. Everard!'  Leonard was not prepared to go on under\r\nthe circumstances.  His own mention of 'letter,' although he had\r\ndeliberately used it with the intention of frightening Stephen, had\r\nfrightened himself.  It reminded him that he had not brought, had not\r\ngot, the letter; and that as yet he was not certain of getting the money.\r\nStephen also had noted the word, and determined not to pass the matter\r\nby.  She said gaily:\r\n\r\n'If a letter is a spell, I think you have a spell of mine, which is a\r\nspell of my own weaving.  You were to show me the letter in which I asked\r\nyou to come to see me.  It was in that, I think you said, that I\r\nmentioned your debts; but I don't remember doing so.  Show it to me!'\r\n\r\n'I have not got it with me!'  This was said with mulish sullenness.\r\n\r\n'Why not?'\r\n\r\n'I forgot.'\r\n\r\n'That is a pity!  It is always a pity to forget things in a business\r\ntransaction; as this is.  I think, Auntie, we must wait till we have all\r\nthe documents, before we can complete this transaction!'\r\n\r\nLeonard was seriously alarmed.  If the matter of the loan were not gone\r\non with at once the jeweller's bill could not be paid by Monday, and the\r\nresult would be another scene with his father.  He turned to Stephen and\r\nsaid as charmingly as he could, and he was all in earnest now:\r\n\r\n'I'm awfully sorry!  But these debts have been so worrying me that they\r\nput lots of things out of my head.  That bill to be paid on Monday, when\r\nI haven't a feather to fly with, is enough to drive a fellow off his\r\nchump.  The moment I lay my hands on the letter I shall keep it with me\r\nso that I can't forget it again.  Won't you forgive me for this time?'\r\n\r\n'Forgive!' she answered, with a laugh.  'Why it's not worth forgiveness!\r\nIt is not worth a second thought!  All right!  Leonard, make your mind\r\neasy; the bill will be paid on Monday!'  Miss Rowly said quietly:\r\n\r\n'I have to be in London on Monday afternoon; I can pay it for you.'  This\r\nwas a shock to Leonard; he said impulsively:\r\n\r\n'Oh, I say!  Can't I . . . '  His words faded away as the old lady again\r\nraised her lorgnon and gazed at him calmly.  She went on:\r\n\r\n'You know, my dear, it won't be even out of my way, as I have to call at\r\nMr. Malpas's office, and I can go there from the hotel in Regent Street.'\r\nThis was all news to Stephen.  She did not know that her aunt had\r\nintended going to London; and indeed she did not know of any business\r\nwith Mr. Malpas, whose firm had been London solicitor to the Rowlys for\r\nseveral generations.  She had no doubt, however, as to the old lady's\r\nintention.  It was plain to her that she wanted to help.  So she thanked\r\nher sweetly.  Leonard could say nothing.  He seemed to be left completely\r\nout of it.  When Stephen rose, as a hint to him that it was time for him\r\nto go, he said humbly, as he left:\r\n\r\n'Would it be possible that I should have the receipt before Monday\r\nevening?  I want to show it to my father.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly!' said the old lady, answering him.  'I shall be back by the\r\ntwo o'clock train; and if you happen to be at the railway station at\r\nNorcester when I arrive I can give it to you!'\r\n\r\nHe went away relieved, but vindictive; determined in his own mind that\r\nwhen he had received the money for the rest of the debts he would see\r\nStephen, when the old lady was not present, and have it out with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX--A LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday evening after dinner Mr. Everard and his son sat for a while in\r\nsilence.  They had not met since morning; and in the presence of the\r\nservants conversation had been scrupulously polite.  Now, though they\r\nwere both waiting to talk, neither liked to begin.  The older man was\r\noutwardly placid, when Leonard, a little flushed and a little nervous of\r\nvoice, began:\r\n\r\n'Have you had any more bills?'  He had expected none, and thus hoped to\r\nbegin by scoring against his father.  It was something of a set-down when\r\nthe latter, taking some papers from his breast-pocket, handed them to\r\nhim, saying:\r\n\r\n'Only these!'  Leonard took them in silence and looked at them.  All were\r\nrequests for payment of debts due by his son.\r\n\r\nIn each case the full bill was enclosed.  He was silent a while; but his\r\nfather spoke:\r\n\r\n'It would almost seem as if all these people had made up their minds that\r\nyou were of no further use to them.'  Then without pausing he said, but\r\nin a sharper voice:\r\n\r\n'Have you paid the jewellers?  This is Monday!'  Without speaking Leonard\r\ntook leisurely from his pocket folded paper.  This he opened, and, after\r\ndeliberately smoothing out the folds, handed it to his father.  Doubtless\r\nsomething in his manner had already convinced the latter that the debt\r\nwas paid.  He took the paper in as leisurely a way as it had been given,\r\nadjusted his spectacles, and read it.  Seeing that his son had scored\r\nthis time, he covered his chagrin with an appearance of paternal\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n'Good!'  For many reasons he was glad the debt was paid He was himself\r\ntoo poor a man to allow the constant drain his son's debts, and too\r\ncareful of his position to be willing have such exposure as would come\r\nwith a County Court action against his son.  All the same, his\r\nexasperation continued.  Neither was his quiver yet empty.  He shot his\r\nnext arrow:\r\n\r\n'I am glad you paid off those usurers!'  Leonard did not like the\r\ndefinite way he spoke.  Still in silence, he took from his pocket a\r\nsecond paper, which he handed over unfolded.  Mr. Everard read it, and\r\nreturned it politely, with again one word:\r\n\r\n'Good!'  For a few minutes there was silence.  The father spoke again:\r\n\r\n'Those other debts, have you paid them?'  With a calm deliberation so\r\nfull of tacit rudeness that it made his father flush Leonard answered:\r\n\r\n'Not yet, sir!  But I shall think of them presently.  I don't care to be\r\nbustled by them; and I don't mean to!'  It was apparent that though he\r\nspoke verbally of his creditors, his meaning was with regard to others\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n'When will they be paid?'  As his son hesitated, he went on:\r\n\r\n'I am alluding to those who have written to me.  I take it that as my\r\nestate is not entailed, and as you have no income except from me, the\r\ncredit which has been extended to you has been rather on my account than\r\nyour own.  Therefore, as the matter touches my own name, I am entitled to\r\nknow something of what is going on.'  His manner as well as his words was\r\nso threatening that Leonard was a little afraid.  He might imperil his\r\ninheritance.  He answered quickly:\r\n\r\n'Of course, sir, you shall know everything.  After all, you know, my\r\naffairs are your affairs!'\r\n\r\n'I know nothing of the sort.  I may of course be annoyed by your affairs,\r\neven dishonoured, in a way, by them.  But I accept no responsibility\r\nwhatever.  As you have made your bed, so must you lie on it!'\r\n\r\n'It's all right, sir, I assure you.  All my debts, both those you know of\r\nand some you don't, I shall settle very shortly.'\r\n\r\n'How soon?'  The question was sternly put.\r\n\r\n'In a few days.  I dare say a week at furthest will see everything\r\nstraightened out.'\r\n\r\nThe elder man stood, saying gravely as he went to the door:\r\n\r\n'You will do well to tell me when the last of them is paid.  There is\r\nsomething which I shall then want to tell you!'  Without waiting for\r\nreply he went to his study.\r\n\r\nLeonard went to his room and made a systematic, though unavailing, search\r\nfor Stephen's letter; thinking that by some chance he might have\r\nrecovered it from Harold and had overlooked it.\r\n\r\nThe next few days he passed in considerable suspense.  He did not dare go\r\nnear Normanstand until he was summoned, as he knew he would be when he\r\nwas required.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Rowly returned from her visit to London she told Stephen that\r\nshe had paid the bill at the jeweller's, and had taken the precaution of\r\ngetting a receipt, together with a duplicate for Mr. Everard.  The\r\noriginal was by her own request made out as received from Miss Laetitia\r\nRowly in settlement of the account of Leonard Everard, Esq.; the\r\nduplicate merely was 'recd. in settlement of the account of--,' etc.\r\nStephen's brows bent hit thought as she said:\r\n\r\n'Why did you have it done that way, Auntie dear?'  The other answered\r\nquietly:\r\n\r\n'I had a reason, my dear; good reason!  Perhaps I shall tell you all\r\nabout it some day; in the meantime I want you not to ask me anything\r\nabout it.  I have a reason for that too.  Stephen, won't you trust me in\r\nthis, blindfold?'  There was something so sweet and loving in the way she\r\nmade the request that Stephen was filled with emotion.  She put her arms\r\nround her aunt's neck and hugged her tight.  Then laying her head on her\r\nbosom she said with a sigh:\r\n\r\n'Oh, my dear, you can't know how I trust you; or how much your trust is\r\nto me.  You never can know!'\r\n\r\nThe next day the two women held a long consultation over the schedule of\r\nLeonard's debts.  Neither said a word of disfavour, or even commented on\r\nthe magnitude.  The only remark touching on the subject was made by Miss\r\nRowly:\r\n\r\n'We must ask for proper discounts.  Oh, the villainy of those tradesmen!\r\nI do believe they charge double in the hope of getting half.  As to\r\njewellers . . . !'  Then she announced her intention of going up to town\r\nagain on Thursday, at which visit she would arrange for the payment of\r\nthe various debts.  Stephen tried to remonstrate, but she was obdurate.\r\nShe held Stephen's hand in hers and stroked it lovingly as she kept on\r\nrepeating:\r\n\r\n'Leave it all to me, dear!  Leave it all to me!  Everything shall be paid\r\nas you wish; but leave it to me!'\r\n\r\nStephen acquiesced.  This gentle yielding was new in her; it touched the\r\nelder lady to the quick, even whilst it pained her.  Well she knew that\r\nsome trouble must have gone to the smoothing of that imperious nature.\r\n\r\nStephen's inner life in these last few days was so bitterly sad that she\r\nkept it apart from all the routine of social existence.  Into it never\r\ncame now, except as the exciting cause of all the evil, a thought of\r\nLeonard.  The saddening memory was of Harold.  And of him the sadness was\r\nincreased and multiplied by a haunting fear.  Since he had walked out of\r\nthe grove she had not seen him nor heard from him.  This was in itself\r\nstrange; for in all her life, when she was at home and he too, never a\r\nday passed without her seeing him.  She had heard her aunt say that word\r\nhad come of his having made a sudden journey to London, from which he had\r\nnot yet returned.  She was afraid to make inquiries.  Partly lest she\r\nmight hear bad news--this was her secret fear; partly lest she might\r\nbring some attention to herself in connection with his going.  Of some\r\nthings in connection with her conduct to him she was afraid to think at\r\nall.  Thought, she felt, would come in time, and with it new pains and\r\nnew shames, of which as yet she dared not think.\r\n\r\nOne morning came an envelope directed in Harold's hand.  The sight made\r\nher almost faint.  She rejoiced that she had been first down, and had\r\nopened the postbag with her own key.  She took the letter to her room and\r\nshut herself in before opening it.  Within were a few lines of writing\r\nand her own letter to Leonard in its envelope.  Her head beat so hard\r\nthat she could scarcely see; but gradually the writing seemed to grow out\r\nof the mist:\r\n\r\n'The enclosed should be in your hands.  It is possible that it may\r\ncomfort you to know that it is safe.  Whatever may come, God love and\r\nguard you.'\r\n\r\nFor a moment joy, hot and strong, blazed through her.  The last words\r\nwere ringing through her brain.  Then came the cold shock, and the gloom\r\nof fear.  Harold would never have written thus unless he was going away!\r\nIt was a farewell!\r\n\r\nFor a long time she stood, motionless, holding the letter in her hand.\r\nThen she said, half aloud:\r\n\r\n'Comfort!  Comfort!  There is no more comfort in the world for me!  Never,\r\nnever again!  Oh, Harold!  Harold!'\r\n\r\nShe sank on her knees beside her bed, and buried her face in her cold\r\nhands, sobbing in all that saddest and bitterest phase of sorrow which\r\ncan be to a woman's heart: the sorrow that is dry-eyed and without hope.\r\n\r\nPresently the habit of caution which had governed her last days woke her\r\nto action.  She bathed her eyes, smoothed her hair, locked the letter and\r\nits enclosure in the little jewel-safe let into the wall, and came down\r\nto breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe sense of loss was so strong on her that she forgot herself.  Habit\r\ncarried her on without will or voluntary effort, and, so faithfully\r\nworked to her good that even the loving eyes of her aunt--and the eyes of\r\nlove are keen--had no suspicion that any new event had come into her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nNot till she was alone in her room that night did Stephen dare to let her\r\nthoughts run freely.  In the darkness her mind began to work truly, so\r\ntruly that she began at the first step of logical process: to study\r\nfacts.  And to study them she must question till she found motive.\r\n\r\nWhy had Harold sent her the letter?  His own words said that it should be\r\nin her hands.  Then, again, he said it might comfort her to know the\r\nletter was safe.  How could it comfort her?  How did he get possession of\r\nthe letter?\r\n\r\nThere she began to understand; her quick intuition and her old knowledge\r\nof Harold's character and her new knowledge of Leonard's, helped her to\r\nreconstruct causes.  In his interview with her he had admitted that\r\nLeonard had told him much, all.  He would no doubt have refused to\r\nbelieve him, and Leonard would have shown him, as proof, her letter\r\nasking him to meet her.  He would have seen then, as she did now, how\r\nmuch the possession of that letter might mean to any one.\r\n\r\nGood God! to 'any one.'  Could it have been so to Harold himself . . .\r\nthat he thought to use it as an engine, to force her to meet his\r\nwishes--as Leonard had already tried to do!  The mistrust, founded on her\r\nfear, was not dead yet . . . No! no! no!  Her whole being resented such a\r\nmonstrous proposition!  Besides, there was proof.  Thank God! there was\r\nproof.  A blackmailer would have stayed close to her, and would have kept\r\nthe letter; Harold did neither.  Her recognition of the truth was shown\r\nin her act, when, stretching out her arms in the darkness, she whispered\r\npleadingly:\r\n\r\n'Forgive me, Harold!'\r\n\r\nAnd Harold, far away where the setting sun was lying red on the rim of\r\nthe western sea, could not hear her.  But perhaps God did.\r\n\r\nAs, then, Harold's motive was not of the basest, it must have been of the\r\nnoblest.  What would be a man's noblest motive under such circumstances?\r\nSurely self-sacrifice!\r\n\r\nAnd yet there could be no doubt as to Harold's earnestness when he had\r\ntold her that he loved her . . .\r\n\r\nHere Stephen covered her face in one moment of rapture.  But the gloom\r\nthat followed was darker than the night.  She did not pursue the thought.\r\nThat would come later when she should understand.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, so little do we poor mortals know the verities of things, so\r\nblind are we to things thrust before our eyes, that she understood more\r\nin that moment of ecstasy than in all the reasoning that preceded and\r\nfollowed it.  But the reasoning went on:\r\n\r\nIf he really loved, and told her so, wherein was the self-sacrifice?  She\r\nhad reproached him with coming to her with his suit hotfoot upon his\r\nknowledge of her shameful proffer of herself to another man; of her\r\nrefusal by him.  Could he have been so blind as not to have seen, as she\r\ndid, the shameful aspect of his impulsive act?  Surely, if he had\r\nthought, he must have seen! . . . And he must have thought; there had\r\nbeen time for it.  It was at dinner that he had seen Leonard; it was\r\nafter breakfast when he had seen her . . . And if he had seen then . . .\r\n\r\nIn an instant it all burst upon her; the whole splendid truth.  He had\r\nheld back the expression of his long love for her, waiting for the time\r\nwhen her maturity might enable her to understand truly and judge wisely;\r\nwaiting till her grief for the loss of her father had become a story of\r\nthe past; waiting for God knows what a man's mind sees of obstacles when\r\nhe loves.  But he had spoken it out when it was to her benefit.  What,\r\nthen, had been his idea of her benefit?  Was it that he wished to meet\r\nthe desire that she had manifested to have some man to--to love? . . .\r\nThe way she covered her face with her hands whilst she groaned aloud made\r\nher answer to her own query a perfect negative.\r\n\r\nWas it, then, to save her from the evil of marrying Leonard in case he\r\nshould repent of his harshness, and later on yield himself to her wooing?\r\nThe fierce movement of her whole body, which almost threw the clothes\r\nfrom her bed, as the shameful recollection rolled over her, marked the\r\nmeasure of her self-disdain.\r\n\r\nOne other alternative there was; but it seemed so remote, so far-fetched,\r\nso noble, so unlike what a woman would do, that she could only regard it\r\nin a shamefaced way.  She put the matter to herself questioningly, and\r\nwith a meekness which had its roots deeper than she knew.  And here out\r\nof the depths of her humility came a noble thought.  A noble thought,\r\nwhich was a noble truth.  Through the darkness of the night, through the\r\ninky gloom of her own soul came with that thought a ray of truth which,\r\nwhilst it showed her her own shrivelled unworthiness, made the man whom\r\nshe had dishonoured with insults worse than death stand out in noble\r\nrelief.  In that instant she guessed at, and realised, Harold's unselfish\r\nnobility of purpose, the supreme effort of his constant love.  Knowing\r\nthe humiliation she must have suffered at Leonard's hands, he had so\r\nplaced himself that even her rejection of him might be some solace to her\r\nwounded spirit, her pride.\r\n\r\nHere at last was truth!  She knew it in the very marrow of her bones.\r\n\r\nThis time she did not move.  She thought and thought of that noble\r\ngentleman who had used for her sake even that pent-up passion which, for\r\nher sake also, he had suppressed so long.\r\n\r\nIn that light, which restored in her eyes and justified so fully the man\r\nwhom she had always trusted, her own shame and wrongdoing, and the perils\r\nwhich surrounded her, were for the time forgotten.\r\n\r\nAnd its glory seemed to rest upon her whilst she slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX--CONFIDENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Rowly had received a bulky letter by the morning's post.  She had\r\nnot opened it, but had allowed it to rest beside her plate all breakfast-\r\ntime.  Then she had taken it away with her to her own sitting-room.\r\nStephen did not appear to take any notice of it.  She knew quite well\r\nthat it was from some one in London whom her aunt had asked to pay\r\nLeonard's bills.  She also knew that the old lady had some purpose in her\r\nreticence, so she waited.  She was learning to be patient in these days.\r\nMiss Rowly did say anything about it that day, or the next, or the next.\r\nThe third-morning, she received another letter which she had read in an\r\nenlightening manner.  She began its perusal with set brow frowning, then\r\nshe nodded her head and smiled.  She put the letter back in its envelope\r\nand placed it in the little bag always carried.  But she said nothing.\r\nStephen wondered, but waited.\r\n\r\nThat night, when Stephen's maid had left her, there came a gentle tap at\r\nher door, and an instant after the door opened.  The tap had been a\r\nwarning, not a request; it had in a measure prepared Stephen, who was not\r\nsurprised to see her Aunt in dressing-gown, though it was many a long day\r\nsince she had visited her niece's room at night.  She closed the door\r\nbehind her, saying:\r\n\r\n'There is something I want to talk to you about, dearest, and I thought\r\nit would be better to do so when there could not be any possible\r\ninterruption.  And besides,' here there was a little break in her voice,\r\n'I could hardly summon up my courage in the daylight.'  She stopped, and\r\nthe stopping told its own story.  In an instant Stephen's arm's were\r\nround her, all the protective instinct in her awake, at the distress of\r\nthe woman she loved.  The old lady took comfort from the warmth of the\r\nembrace, and held her tight whilst she went on:\r\n\r\n'It is about these bills, my dear.  Come and sit down and put a candle\r\nnear me.  I want you to read something.'\r\n\r\n'Go on, Auntie dear,' she said gravely.  The old lady, after a pause,\r\nspoke with a certain timidity:\r\n\r\n'They are all paid; at least all that can be.  Perhaps I had better read\r\nyou the letter I have had from my solicitors:\r\n\r\n'\"Dear Madam,--In accordance with your instructions we have paid all the\r\naccounts mentioned in Schedule A (enclosed).  We have placed for your\r\nconvenience three columns: (1) the original amount of each account, (2)\r\nthe amount of discount we were able to arrange, and (3) the amount paid.\r\nWe regret that we have been unable to carry out your wishes with regard\r\nto the items enumerated in Schedule B (enclosed).  We have, we assure\r\nyou, done all in our power to find the gentlemen whose names and\r\naddresses are therein given.  These were marked 'Debt of honour' in the\r\nlist you handed to us.  Not having been able to obtain any reply to our\r\nletters, we sent one of our clerks first to the addresses in London, and\r\nafterwards to Oxford.  That clerk, who is well used to such inquiries,\r\ncould not find trace of any of the gentlemen, or indeed of their\r\nexistence.  We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that, either there\r\nmust be some error with regard to (a) names, (b) addresses, or (c) both;\r\nor that no such persons exist.  As it would be very unlikely that such\r\nerrors could occur in all the cases, we can only conclude that there have\r\nnot been any such persons.  If we may hazard an opinion: it is possible\r\nthat, these debts being what young men call 'debts of honour,' the\r\ndebtor, or possibly the creditors, may not have wished the names\r\nmentioned.  In such case fictitious names and addresses may have been\r\nsubstituted for the real ones.  If you should like any further inquiry\r\ninstituted we would suggest that you ascertain the exact names and\r\naddresses from the debtor.  Or should you prefer it we would see the\r\ngentleman on your behalf, on learning from you his name and address.  We\r\ncan keep, in the person of either one of the Firm or a Confidential Clerk\r\nas you might prefer, any appointment in such behalf you may care to make.\r\n\r\n'\"We have already sent to you the receipted account from each of the\r\ncreditors as you directed, viz. 'Received from Miss Laetitia Rowly in\r\nfull settlement to date of the account due by Mr. Leonard Everard the sum\r\nof,' etc. etc.  And also, as you further directed, a duplicate receipt of\r\nthe sum-total due in each case made out as 'Received in full settlement\r\nto date of account due by,' etc. etc.  The duplicate receipt was pinned\r\nat the back of each account so as to be easily detachable.\r\n\r\n'\"With regard to finance we have carried out your orders, etc.\"'  She\r\nhurried on the reading.  \"These sums, together with the amounts of nine\r\nhundred pounds sterling, and seven hundred pounds sterling lodged to the\r\naccount of Miss Stephen Norman in the Norcester branch of the Bank as\r\nrepayment of moneys advanced to you as by your written instructions, have\r\nexhausted the sum, etc.\"'  She folded up the letter with the schedules,\r\nlaying the bundle of accounts on the table.  Stephen paused; she felt it\r\nnecessary to collect herself before speaking.\r\n\r\n'Auntie dear, will you let me see that letter?  Oh, my dear, dear Auntie,\r\ndon't think I mistrust you that I ask it.  I do because I love you, and\r\nbecause I want to love you more if it is possible to do so.'  Miss Rowly\r\nhanded her the letter.  She rose from the arm of the chair and stood\r\nbeside the table as though to get better light from the candle than she\r\ncould get from where she had sat.\r\n\r\nShe read slowly and carefully to the end; then folded up the letter and\r\nhanded it to her aunt.  She came back to her seat on the edge of the\r\nchair, and putting her arms round her companion's neck looked her\r\nstraight in the eyes.  The elder woman grew embarrassed under the\r\nscrutiny; she coloured up and smiled in a deprecatory way as she said:\r\n\r\n'Don't look at me like that, darling; and don't shake your head so.  It\r\nis all right!  I told you I had my reasons, and you said you would trust\r\nme.  I have only done what I thought best!'\r\n\r\n'But, Auntie, you have paid away more than half your little fortune.  I\r\nknow all the figures.  Father and uncle told me everything.  Why did you\r\ndo it?  Why did you do it?'  The old woman held out her arms as she said:\r\n\r\n'Come here, dear one, and sit on my knee as you used to when you were a\r\nchild, and I will whisper you.'  Stephen sprang from her seat and almost\r\nthrew herself into the loving arms.  For a few seconds the two, clasped\r\ntight to each other's heart, rocked gently to and fro.  The elder kissed\r\nthe younger and was kissed impulsively in return.  Then she stroked the\r\nbeautiful bright hair with her wrinkled hand, and said admiringly:\r\n\r\n'What lovely hair you have, my dear one!'  Stephen held her closer and\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\n'Well, my dear, I did it because I love you!'\r\n\r\n'I know that, Auntie; you have never done anything else my life!'\r\n\r\n'That is true, dear one.  But it is right that I should do this.  Now you\r\nmust listen to me, and not speak till I have done.  Keep your thoughts on\r\nmy words, so that you may follow my thoughts.  You can do your own\r\nthinking about them afterwards.  And your own talking too; I shall listen\r\nas long as you like!'\r\n\r\n'Go on, I'll be good!'\r\n\r\n'My dear, it is not right that you should appear to have paid the debts\r\nof a young man who is no relation to you and who will, I know well, never\r\nbe any closer to you than he is now.'  She hurried on, as though fearing\r\nan interruption, but Stephen felt that her clasp tightened.  'We never\r\ncan tell what will happen as life goes on.  And, as the world is full of\r\nscandal, one cannot be too careful not to give the scandalmongers\r\nanything to exercise their wicked spite upon.  I don't trust that young\r\nman! he is a bad one all round, or I am very much mistaken.  And, my\r\ndear, come close to me!  I cannot but see that you and he have some\r\nsecret which he is using to distress you!'  She paused, and her clasp\r\ngrew closer still as Stephen's head sank on her breast.  'I know you have\r\ndone something or said something foolish of which he has a knowledge.  And\r\nI know my dear one, that whatever it was, and no matter how foolish it\r\nmay have been, it was not a wrong thing.  God knows, we are all apt to do\r\nwrong things as well as foolish ones; the best of us.  But such is not\r\nfor you!  Your race, your father and mother, your upbringing, yourself\r\nand the truth and purity which are yours would save you from anything\r\nwhich was in itself wrong.  That I know, my dear, as well as I know\r\nmyself!  Ah! better, far better! for the gods did not think it well to\r\ndower me as they have dowered you.  The God of all the gods has given you\r\nthe ten talents to guard; and He knows, as I do, that you will be\r\nfaithful to your trust.'\r\n\r\nThere was a solemn ring in her voce as the words were spoken which went\r\nthrough the young girl's heart.  Love and confidence demanded in return\r\nthat she should have at least the relief of certain acquiescence; there\r\nis a possible note of pain in the tensity of every string!  Stephen\r\nlifted her head proudly and honestly, though her cheeks were scarlet,\r\nsaying with a consciousness of integrity which spoke directly soul to\r\nsoul:\r\n\r\n'You are right, dear!  I have done something very foolish; very, very\r\nfoolish!  But it was nothing which any one could call wrong.  Do not ask\r\nme what it was.  I need only tell you this: that it was an outrage on\r\nconvention.  It was so foolish, and based on such foolish misconception;\r\nit sprang from such over-weening, arrogant self-opinion that it deserves\r\nthe bitter punishment which will come; which is coming; which is with me\r\nnow!  It was the cause of something whose blackness I can't yet realise;\r\nbut of which I will tell you when I can speak of it.  But it was not\r\nwrong in itself, or in the eyes of God or man!'  The old woman said not a\r\nword.  No word was needed, for had she not already expressed her belief?\r\nBut Stephen felt her relief in the glad pressure of her finger-tips.  In\r\na voice less strained and tense Miss Rowly went on:\r\n\r\n'What need have I for money, dear?  Here I have all that any woman,\r\nespecially at my age, can need.  There is no room even for charity; you\r\nare so good to all your people that my help is hardly required.  And, my\r\ndear one, I know--I know,' she emphasised the word as she stroked the\r\nbeautiful hair, 'that when I am gone my own poor, the few that I have\r\nlooked after all my life, will, not suffer when my darling thinks of me!'\r\nStephen fairly climbed upon her as she said, looking in the brave old\r\neyes:\r\n\r\n'So help me God, my darling, they shall never want!'\r\n\r\nSilence for a time; and then Miss Rowly's voice again:\r\n\r\n'Though it would not do for the world to know that a young maiden lady\r\nhad paid the debts of a vicious young man, it makes no matter if they be\r\npaid by an old woman, be the same maid, wife, or widow!  And really, my\r\ndear, I do not see how any money I might have could be better spent than\r\nin keeping harm away from you.'\r\n\r\n'There need not be any harm at all, Auntie.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps not, dear!  I hope not with all my heart.  But I fear that young\r\nman.  Just fancy him threatening you, and in your own house; in my very\r\npresence!  Oh! yes, my dear.  He meant to threaten, anyhow!  Though I\r\ncould not exactly understand what he was driving at, I could see that he\r\nwas driving at something.  And after all that you were doing for him, and\r\nhad done for him!  I mean, of course, after all that I had done for him,\r\nand was doing for him.  It is mean enough, surely, for a man to beg, and\r\nfrom a woman; but to threaten afterwards.  Ach!  But I think, my dear, it\r\nis checkmate to him this time.  All along the line the only proof that is\r\nof there being any friendliness towards him from this house points to me.\r\nAnd moreover, my dear, I have a little plan in my head that will tend to\r\nshow him up even better, in case he may ever try to annoy us.  Look at me\r\nwhen next he is here.  I mean to do a little play-acting which will\r\nastonish him, I can tell you, if it doesn't frighten him out of the house\r\naltogether.  But we won't talk of that yet.  You will understand when you\r\nsee it!'  Her eyes twinkled and her mouth shut with a loud snap as she\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes of repose, which was like a glimpse of heaven to\r\nStephen's aching heart, she spoke again:\r\n\r\n'There was something else that troubled you more than even this.  You\r\nsaid you would tell me when you were able to speak of it . . . Why not\r\nspeak now?  Oh! my dear, our hearts are close together to-night; and in\r\nall your life, you will never have any one who will listen with greater\r\nsympathy than I will, or deal more tenderly with your fault, whatever it\r\nmay have been.  Tell me, dear!  Dear!' she whispered after a pause,\r\nduring which she realised the depth of the girl's emotion by her\r\nconvulsive struggling to keep herself in check.\r\n\r\nAll at once the tortured girl seemed to yield herself, and slipped\r\ninertly from her grasp till kneeling down she laid her head in the\r\nmotherly lap and sobbed.  Miss Rowly kept stroking her hair in silence.\r\nPresently the girl looked up, and with a pang the aunt saw that her eyes\r\nwere dry.  In her pain she said:\r\n\r\n'You sob like that, my child, and yet you are not crying; what is it, oh!\r\nmy dear one?  What is it that hurts you so that you cannot cry?'\r\n\r\nAnd then the bitter sobbing broke out again, but still alas! without\r\ntears.  Crouching low, and still enclosing her aunt's waist with her\r\noutstretched arms and hiding her head in her breast; she said:\r\n\r\n'Oh! Auntie, I have sent Harold away!'\r\n\r\n'What, my dear?  What?' said the old lady astonished.  'Why, I thought\r\nthere was no one in the world that you trusted so much as Harold!'\r\n\r\n'It is true.  There was--there is no one except you whom I trust so much.\r\nBut I mistook something he said.  I was in a blind fury at the time, and\r\nI said things that I thought my father's daughter never could have said.\r\nAnd she never thought them, even then!  Oh, Auntie, I drove him away with\r\nall the horrible things I could say that would wound him.  And all\r\nbecause he acted in a way that I see now was the most noble and knightly\r\nin which any man could act.  He that my dear father had loved, and\r\nhonoured, and trusted as another son.  He that was a real son to him, and\r\nnot a mock sop like me.  I sent him away with such fierce and bitter pain\r\nthat his poor face was ashen grey, and there was woe in his eyes that\r\nshall make woe in mine whenever I shall see them in my mind, waking or\r\nsleeping.  He, the truest friend . . . the most faithful, the most\r\ntender, the most strong, the most unselfish!  Oh! Auntie, Auntie, he just\r\nturned and bowed and went away.  And he couldn't do anything else with\r\nthe way I spoke to him; and now I shall never see him again!'\r\n\r\nThe young girl's eyes ware still dry, but the old woman's were wet.  For\r\na few minutes she kept softly stroking the bowed heat till the sobbing\r\ngrew less and less, and then died away; and the girl lay still, collapsed\r\nin the abandonment of dry-eyed grief.\r\n\r\nThen she rose, and taking off her dressing-gown, said tenderly:\r\n\r\n'Let me stay with you to-night, dear one?  Go to sleep in my arms, as you\r\ndid long ago when there was any grief that you could not bear.'\r\n\r\nSo Stephen lay in those loving arms till her own young breast ceased\r\nheaving, and she breathed softly.  Till dawn she slept on the bosom of\r\nher who loved her so well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI--THE DUTY OF COURTESY\r\n\r\n\r\nLeonard was getting tired of waiting when he received his summons to\r\nNormanstand.  But despite his impatience he was ill pleased with the\r\nsummons, which came in the shape of a polite note from Miss Rowly asking\r\nhim to come that afternoon at tea-time.  He had expected to hear from\r\nStephen.\r\n\r\n'Damn that old woman!  You'd think she was working the whole show!'\r\nHowever, he turned up at a little before five o'clock, spruce and dapper\r\nand well dressed and groomed as usual.  He was shown, as before, into the\r\nblue drawing-room.  Miss Rowly, who sat there, rose as he entered, and\r\ncoming across the room, greeted him, as he thought, effusively.  He\r\nactually winced when she called him 'my dear boy' before the butler.\r\n\r\nShe ordered tea to be served at once, and when it had been brought she\r\nsaid to the butler:\r\n\r\n'Tell Mannerly to bring me a large thick envelope which is on the table\r\nin my room.  It is marked L.E. on the outside.'  Presently an elderly\r\nmaid handed her the envelope and withdrew.  When tea was over she opened\r\nthe envelope, and taking from it a number of folios, looked over them\r\ncarefully; holding them in her lap, she said quietly:\r\n\r\n'You will find writing materials on the table.  I am all ready now to\r\nhand you over the receipts.'  His eyes glistened.  This was good news at\r\nall events; the debts were paid.  In a rapid flash of thought he came to\r\nthe conclusion that if the debts were actually paid he need not be civil\r\nto the old lady.  He felt that he could have been rude to her if he had\r\nactual possession of the receipts.  As it was, however, he could not yet\r\nafford to have any unpleasantness.  There was still to come that lowering\r\ninterview with his father; and he could not look towards it\r\nsatisfactorily until he had the assurance of the actual documents that he\r\nwas safe.  Miss Rowly was, in her own way, reading his mind in his face.\r\nHer lorgnon seemed to follow his every expression like a searchlight.  He\r\nremembered his former interview with her, and how he had been bested in\r\nit; so he made up his mind to acquiesce in time.  He went over to the\r\ntable and sat down.  Taking a pen he turned to Miss Rowly and said:\r\n\r\n'What shall I write?'  She answered calmly:\r\n\r\n'Date it, and then say, \"Received from Miss Laetitia Rowly the receipts\r\nfor the following amounts from the various firms hereunder enumerated.\"'\r\nShe then proceeded to read them, he writing and repeating as he wrote.\r\nThen she added:\r\n\r\n'\"The same being the total amount of my debts which she has kindly paid\r\nfor me.\"'  He paused here; she asked.\r\n\r\n'Why don't you go on?'\r\n\r\n'I thought it was Stephen--Miss Norman,' he corrected, catching sight of\r\nher lorgnon, 'who was paying them.'\r\n\r\n'Good Lord, man,' she answered, 'what does it matter who has paid them,\r\nso long as they are paid?'\r\n\r\n'But I didn't ask you to pay them,' he went on obstinately.  There was a\r\npause, and then the old lady, with a distinctly sarcastic smile, said:\r\n\r\n'It seems to me, young man, that you are rather particular as to how\r\nthings are done for you.  If you had begun to be just a little bit as\r\nparticular in making the debts as you are in the way of having them paid,\r\nthere would be a little less trouble and expense all round.  However, the\r\ndebts have been paid, and we can't unpay them.  But of course you can\r\nrepay me the money if you like.  It amounts in all to four thousand three\r\nhundred and seventeen pounds, twelve shillings and sixpence, and I have\r\npaid every penny of it out of my own pocket.  If you can't pay it\r\nyourself, perhaps your father would like to do so.'\r\n\r\nThe last shot told; he went on writing: '\"Kindly paid for me,\"' she\r\ncontinued in the same even voice:\r\n\r\n'\"In remembrance of my mother, of whom she was an acquaintance.\"  Now\r\nsign it!'  He did so and handed it to her.  She read it over carefully,\r\nfolded it, and put it in her pocket.  She then stood.  He rose also; and\r\nas he moved to the door--he had not offered to shake hands with her--he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'I should like to see, Miss Norman.'\r\n\r\n'I am afraid you will have to wait.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'She is over at Heply Regis.  She went there for Lady Heply's ball, and\r\nwill remain for a few days.  Good afternoon!'  The tone in which the last\r\ntwo words were spoken seemed in his ears like the crow of the victor\r\nafter a cock-fight.\r\n\r\nAs he was going out of the room a thought struck her.  She felt he\r\ndeserved some punishment for his personal rudeness to her.  After all,\r\nshe had paid half her fortune for him, though not on his account; and not\r\nonly had he given no thanks, but had not even offered the usual courtesy\r\nof saying good-bye.  She had intended to have been silent on the subject,\r\nand to have allowed him to discover it later.  Now she said, as if it was\r\nan after-thought:\r\n\r\n'By the way, I did not pay those items you put down as \"debts of honour\";\r\nyou remember you gave the actual names and addresses.'\r\n\r\n'Why not?' the question came from him involuntarily.  The persecuting\r\nlorgnon rose again:\r\n\r\n'Because they were all bogus!  Addresses, names, debts, honour!  Good\r\nafternoon!'\r\n\r\nHe went out flaming; free from debt, money debts; all but one.  And some\r\nother debts--not financial--whose magnitude was exemplified in the\r\ngrinding of his teeth.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast next morning he said to his father:\r\n\r\n'By the way, you said you wished to speak to me, sir.'  There was\r\nsomething in the tone of his voice which called up antagonism.\r\n\r\n'Then you have paid your debts?'\r\n\r\n'All!'\r\n\r\n'Good!  Now there is something which it is necessary I should call your\r\nattention to.  Do you remember the day on which I handed you that\r\npleasing epistle from Messrs. Cavendish and Cecil?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Didn't you send a telegram to them?'\r\n\r\n'I did.'\r\n\r\n'You wrote it yourself?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly.'\r\n\r\n'I had a courteous letter from the money-lenders, thanking me for my\r\nexertions in securing the settlement of their claim, and saying that in\r\naccordance with the request in my telegram they had held over proceedings\r\nuntil the day named.  I did not quite remember having sent any telegram\r\nto them, or any letter either.  So, being at a loss, I went to our\r\nexcellent postmaster and requested that he would verify the sending of a\r\ntelegram to London from me.  He courteously looked up the file; which was\r\nready for transference to the G.P.O., and showed me the form.  It was in\r\nyour handwriting.'  He paused so long that Leonard presently said:\r\n\r\n'Well!'\r\n\r\n'It was signed Jasper Everard.  Jasper Everard! my name; and yet it was\r\nsent by my son, who was christened, if I remember rightly, Leonard!'  Then\r\nhe went on, only in a cold acrid manner which made his son feel as though\r\na February wind was blowing on his back:\r\n\r\n'I think there need not have been much trouble in learning to avoid\r\nconfusing our names.  They are really dissimilar.  Have you any\r\nexplanation to offer of the--the error, let us call it?'  A bright\r\nthought struck Leonard.\r\n\r\n'Why, sir,' he said, 'I put it in your name as they had written to you.  I\r\nthought it only courteous.'  The elder man winced; he had not expected\r\nthe excuse.  We went on speaking in the same calm way, but his tone was\r\nmore acrid than before:\r\n\r\n'Good! of course!  It was only courteous of you!  Quite so!  But I think\r\nit will be well in the future to let me look after my own courtesy; as\r\nregards my signature at any rate.  You see, my dear boy, a signature is\r\nqueer sort of thing, and judges and juries are apt to take a poor view of\r\ncourtesy as over against the conventions regarding a man, writing his own\r\nname.  What I want to tell you is this, that on seeing that signature I\r\nmade a new will.  You see, my estate is not entailed, and therefore I\r\nthink it only right to see that in such a final matter justice is done\r\nall round.  I therefore made a certain provision of which I am sure you\r\nwill approve.  Indeed, since I am assured of the payment of your debts, I\r\nfeel justified in my action.  I may say, inter alia, that I congratulate\r\nyou on either the extent of your resources or the excellence of your\r\nfriendships, or both.  I confess that the amounts brought to my notice\r\nwere rather large; more especially in proportion to the value of the\r\nestate which you are some day to inherit.  For you are of course to\r\ninherit some day, my dear boy.  You are my only son, and it would be\r\nhardly--hardly courteous of me not to leave it to you.  But I have put a\r\nclause in my will to the effect that the trustee's are to pay all debts\r\nof your accruing which can be proved against you, before handing over to\r\nyou either the estate itself or the remainder after its sale and the\r\nsettlement of all claims.  That's all.  Now run away, my boy; I have some\r\nimportant work to do.'\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe day after her return from Heply Regis, Stephen was walking in the\r\nwood when she thought she heard a slight rustling of leaves some way\r\nbehind her.  She looked round, expecting to see some one; but the leafy\r\npath was quite clear.  Her suspicion was confirmed; some one was secretly\r\nfollowing her.  A short process of exclusions pointed to the personality\r\nof the some one.  Tramps and poachers were unknown in Normanstand, and\r\nthere was no one else whom she could think of who had any motive in\r\nfollowing her in such a way; it must be Leonard Everard.  She turned and\r\nwalked rapidly in the opposite direction.  As this would bring her to the\r\nhouse Leonard had to declare his presence at once or else lose the\r\nopportunity of a private interview which he sought.  When she saw him she\r\nsaid at once and without any salutation:\r\n\r\n'What are you doing there; why are you following me?'\r\n\r\n'I wanted to see you alone.  I could not get near you on account of that\r\ninfernal old woman.'  Stephen's face grew hard.\r\n\r\n'On account of whom?' she asked with dangerous politeness.\r\n\r\n'Miss Rowly; your aunt.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you think, Mr. Everard,' she said icily, 'that it is at least an\r\nunpardonable rudeness to speak that way, and to me, of the woman I love\r\nbest in all the world?'\r\n\r\n'Sorry!' he said in the offhand way of younger days, 'I apologise.  Fact\r\nis, I was angry that she wouldn't let me see you.'\r\n\r\n'Not let you see me!' she said as if amazed.  'What do mean?'\r\n\r\n'Why, I haven't been able to see you alone ever since I went to meet you\r\non Caester Hill.'\r\n\r\n'But why should you see me alone?' she asked as if still in amazement.\r\n'Surely you can say anything you have to say before my aunt.'  With an\r\nunwisdom for which an instant later he blamed himself he blurted out:\r\n\r\n'Why, old girl, you yourself did not think her presence necessary when\r\nyou asked me to meet you on the hill.'\r\n\r\n'When was that?'  She saw that he was angry and wanted to test him; to\r\ntry how far he would venture.  He was getting dangerous; she must know\r\nthe measure of what she had to fear.\r\n\r\nHe fell into the trap at once.  His debts being paid, fear was removed,\r\nand all the hectoring side of the man was aroused.  His antagonist was a\r\nwoman; and he had already had in his life so many unpleasant scenes with\r\nwomen that this was no new experience.  This woman had, by her own\r\nindiscretion, put a whip into his hand; and, if necessary to secure his\r\nown way, by God! he meant to use it!  These last days had made her a more\r\ndesirable possession in his eyes.  The vastness of her estate had taken\r\nhold on him, and his father's remorseless intention with regard to his\r\nwill would either keep him with very limited funds, or leave him\r\neventually a pauper if he forestalled his inheritance.  The desire of her\r\nwealth had grown daily, and it was now the main force in bringing him\r\nhere to-day.  And to this was now added the personal desire which her\r\npresence evoked.  Stephen, at all times beautiful, had never looked more\r\nlovely.  In the days since she had met him on the hilltop, a time that to\r\nher seemed so long ago, she had grown to be a woman, and there is some\r\nsubtle inconceivable charm in completed womanhood.  The reaction from her\r\nterrible fear and depression had come, and her strong brilliant youth was\r\nmanifesting itself.  Her step was springy and her eyes were bright; and\r\nthe glow of fine health, accentuated by the militant humour of the\r\npresent moment, seemed to light up her beautiful skin.  In herself she\r\nwas desirable, very desirable; Leonard felt his pulses quicken and his\r\nblood leap as he looked at her.  Even his prejudice against her red hair\r\nhad changed to something like hungry admiration.  Leonard felt for the\r\nfirst moment since he had known her that she was a woman; and that, with\r\nrelation to her, he was a man.\r\n\r\nAnd at the moment all the man in him asserted itself.  It was with half\r\nlove, as he saw it, and half self-assertion that he answered her\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n'The day you asked me to marry you!  Oh! what a fool I was not to leap at\r\nsuch a chance!  I should have taken you in my arms then and kissed you\r\ntill I showed you how much I loved you.  But that will all come yet; the\r\nkissing is still to come!  Oh!  Stephen, don't you see that I love you?\r\nWon't you tell me that you love me still?  Darling!'  He almost sprang at\r\nher, his arms extended to clasp her.\r\n\r\n'Stop!'  Her voice rang like a trumpet.  She did not mean to submit to\r\nphysical violence, and in the present state of her feeling, an embrace\r\nfrom him would be a desecration.  He was now odious to her; she\r\npositively loathed him.\r\n\r\nBefore her uplifted hand and those flashing eyes, he stopped as one\r\nstricken into stone.  In that instant she knew she was safe; and with a\r\nwoman's quickness of apprehension and resolve, made up her mind what\r\ncourse to pursue.  In a calm voice she said quietly:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Everard, you have followed me in secret, and without my permission.\r\nI cannot talk here with you, alone.  I absolutely refuse to do so; now or\r\nat any other time.  If you have anything especial to say to me you will\r\nfind me at home at noon to-morrow.  Remember, I do not ask you to come.  I\r\nsimply yield to the pressure of your importunity.  And remember also that\r\nI do not authorise you in any way to resume this conversation.  In fact,\r\nI forbid it.  If you come to my house you must control yourself to my\r\nwish!'\r\n\r\nThen with a stately bow, whose imperious distance inflamed him more than\r\never, and without once looking back she took her way home, all agitated\r\ninwardly and with fast beating heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII--FIXING THE BOUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nLeonard came towards Normanstand next forenoon in considerable mental\r\ndisturbance.  In the first place he was seriously in love with Stephen,\r\nand love is in itself a disturbing influence.\r\n\r\nLeonard's love was all of the flesh; and as such had power at present to\r\ndisturb him, as it would later have power to torture him.  Again, he was\r\ndisturbed by the fear of losing Stephen, or rather of not being able to\r\ngain her.  At first, ever since she had left him on the path from the\r\nhilltop till his interview the next day, he had looked on her possession\r\nas an 'option,' to the acceptance of which circumstances seemed to be\r\ncompelling him.  But ever since, that asset seemed to have been\r\ndwindling; and now he was almost beginning to despair.  He was altogether\r\ncold at heart, and yet highly strung with apprehension, as he was shown\r\ninto the blue drawing-room.\r\n\r\nStephen came in alone, closing the door behind her.  She shook hands with\r\nhim, and sat down by a writing-table near the window, pointing to him to\r\nsit on an ottoman a little distance away.  The moment he sat down he\r\nrealised that he was at a disadvantage; he was not close to her, and he\r\ncould not get closer without manifesting his intention of so doing.  He\r\nwanted to be closer, both for the purpose of his suit and for his own\r\npleasure; the proximity of Stephen began to multiply his love for her.  He\r\nthought that to-day she looked better than ever, of a warm radiant beauty\r\nwhich touched his senses with unattainable desire.  She could not but\r\nnotice the passion in his eyes, and instinctively her eyes wandered to a\r\nsilver gong placed on the table well within reach.  The more he glowed,\r\nthe more icily calm she sat, till the silence between them began to grow\r\noppressive.  She waited, determined that he should be the first to speak.\r\nRecognising the helplessness of silence, he began huskily:\r\n\r\n'I came here to-day in the hope that you would listen to me.'  Her\r\nanswer, given with a conventional smile, was not helpful:\r\n\r\n'I am listening.'\r\n\r\n'I cannot tell you how sorry I am that I did not accept your offer.  If I\r\nhad know when I was coming that day that you loved me . . . '  She\r\ninterrupted him, calm of voice, and with uplifted hand:\r\n\r\n'I never said so, did I?  Surely I could not have said such a thing!  I\r\ncertainly don't remember it?'  Leonard was puzzled.\r\n\r\n'You certainly made me think so.  You asked me to marry you, didn't you?'\r\nHer answer came calmly, though in a low voice:\r\n\r\n'I did.'\r\n\r\n'Then if you didn't love me, why did you ask me to marry you?'  It was\r\nhis nature to be more or less satisfied when he had put any one opposed\r\nto him proportionally in the wrong; and now his exultation at having put\r\na poser manifested itself in his tone.  This, however, braced up Stephen\r\nto cope with a difficult and painful situation.  It was with a calm,\r\nseemingly genial frankness, that she answered, smilingly:\r\n\r\n'Do you know, that is what has been puzzling me from that moment to\r\nthis!'  Her words appeared to almost stupefy Leonard.  This view of the\r\nmatter had not occurred to him, and now the puzzle of it made him angry.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean to say,' he asked hotly, 'that you asked a man to marry you\r\nwhen you didn't even love him?'\r\n\r\n'That is exactly what I do mean!  Why I did it is, I assure you, as much\r\na puzzle to me as it is to you.  I have come to the conclusion that it\r\nmust have been from my vanity.  I suppose I wanted to dominate somebody;\r\nand you were the weakest within range!'\r\n\r\n'Thank you!'  He was genuinely angry by this time, and, but for a\r\nwholesome fear of the consequences, would have used strong language.\r\n\r\n'I don't see that I was the weakest about.'  Somehow this set her on her\r\nguard.  She wanted to know more, so she asked:\r\n\r\n'Who else?'\r\n\r\n'Harold An Wolf!  You had him on a string already!'  The name came like a\r\nsword through her heart, but the bitter comment braced her to further\r\ncaution.  Her voice seemed to her to sound as though far away:\r\n\r\n'Indeed!  And may I ask you how you came to know that?'  Her voice seemed\r\nso cold and sneering to him that he lost his temper still further.\r\n\r\n'Simply because he told me so himself.'  It pleased him to do in ill turn\r\nto Harold.  He did not forget that savage clutch at his throat; and he\r\nnever would.  Stephen's senses were all alert.  She saw an opportunity of\r\nlearning something, and went on with the same cold voice:\r\n\r\n'And I suppose it was that pleasing confidence which was the cause of\r\nyour refusal of my offer of marriage; of which circumstance you have so\r\nthoughtfully and so courteously reminded me.'  This, somehow, seemed of\r\ngood import to Leonard.  If he could show her that his intention to marry\r\nher was antecedent to Harold's confidence, she might still go back to her\r\nold affection for him.  He could not believe that it did not still exist;\r\nhis experience of other women showed him that their love outlived their\r\nanger, whether the same had been hot or cold.\r\n\r\n'It had nothing in the world to do with it.  He never said a word about\r\nit till he threatened to kill me--the great brute!'  This was learning\r\nsomething indeed!  She went on in the same voice:\r\n\r\n'And may I ask you what was the cause of such sanguinary intention?'\r\n\r\n'Because he knew that I was going to marry you!'  As he spoke he felt\r\nthat he had betrayed himself; he went on hastily, hoping that it might\r\nescape notice:\r\n\r\n'Because he knew that I loved you.  Oh! Stephen, don't you know it now!\r\nCan't you see that I love you; and that I want you for my wife!'\r\n\r\n'But did he threaten to kill you out of mere jealousy?  Do you still go\r\nin fear of your life?  Will it be necessary to arrest him?'  Leonard was\r\nchagrined at her ignoring of his love-suit, and in his self-engrossment\r\nanswered sulkily:\r\n\r\n'I'm not afraid of him!  And, besides, I believe he has bolted.  I called\r\nat his house yesterday, and his servant said they hadn't heard a word\r\nfrom him.'  Stephen's heart sank lower and lower.  This was what she had\r\ndreaded.  She said in as steady a voice as she could muster:\r\n\r\n'Bolted!  Has he gone altogether?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, he'll come back all right, in time.  He's not going to give up the\r\njolly good living he has here!'\r\n\r\n'But why has he bolted?  When he threatened to kill you did he give any\r\nreason?'  There was too much talk about Harold.  It made him angry; so he\r\nanswered in an offhand way:\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't know.  And, moreover, I don't care!'\r\n\r\n'And now,' said Stephen, having ascertained what she wanted to know,\r\n'what is it that you want to speak to me about?'\r\n\r\nHer words fell on Leonard like a cold douche.  Here had he been talking\r\nabout his love for her, and yet she ignored the whole thing, and asked\r\nhim what he wanted to talk about.\r\n\r\n'What a queer girl you are.  You don't seem to attend to what a fellow is\r\nsaying.  Here have I been telling you that I love you, and asking you to\r\nmarry me; and yet you don't seem to have even heard me!'  She answered at\r\nonce, quite sweetly, and with a smile of superiority which maddened him:\r\n\r\n'But that subject is barred!'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean?  Barred!'\r\n\r\n'Yes.  I told you yesterday!'\r\n\r\n'But, Stephen,' he cried out quickly, all the alarm in him and all the\r\nearnestness of which he was capable uniting to his strengthening, 'can't\r\nyou understand that I love you, with all my heart?  You are so beautiful;\r\nso beautiful!'  He felt now in reality what he was saying.\r\n\r\nThe torrent of his words left no opening for her objection; it swept all\r\nmerely verbal obstacles before it.  She listened, content in a measure.\r\nSo long as he sat at the distance which she had arranged before his\r\ncoming she did not fear any personal violence.  Moreover, it was a\r\nsatisfaction to her now to hear him, who had refused her, pleading in\r\nvain.  The more sincere his eloquence, the larger her satisfaction; she\r\nhad no pity for him now.\r\n\r\n'I know I was a fool, Stephen!  I had my chance that day on the hilltop;\r\nand if I had felt then as I feel now, as I have felt every moment since,\r\nI would not have been so cold.  I would have taken you in my arms and\r\nheld you close and kissed you, again, and again, and again.  Oh, darling!\r\nI love you!  I love you!  I love you!'  He held out his arms imploringly.\r\n'Won't you love me?  Won't--'\r\n\r\nHe stopped, paralysed with angry amazement.  She was laughing.\r\n\r\nHe grew purple in the face; his hands were still outstretched.  The few\r\nseconds seemed like hours.\r\n\r\n'Forgive me!' she said in a polite tone, suddenly growing grave.  'But\r\nreally you looked so funny, sitting there so quietly, and speaking in\r\nsuch a way, that I couldn't help it.  You really must forgive me!  But\r\nremember, I told you the subject was barred; and as, knowing that, you\r\nwent on, you really have no one but yourself to blame!'  Leonard was\r\nfurious, but managed to say as he dropped his arms:\r\n\r\n'But I love you!'\r\n\r\n'That may be, now,' she went on icily.  'But it is too late.  I do not\r\nlove you; and I have never loved you!  Of course, had you accepted my\r\noffer of marriage you should never have known that.  No matter how great\r\nhad been my shame and humiliation when I had come to a sense of what I\r\nhad done, I should have honourably kept my part of the tacit compact\r\nentered into when I made that terrible mistake.  I cannot tell you how\r\nrejoiced and thankful I am that you took my mistake in such a way.  Of\r\ncourse, I do not give you any credit for it; you thought only of\r\nyourself, and did that which you liked best!'\r\n\r\n'That is a nice sort of thing to tell a man!' he interrupted with cynical\r\nfrankness.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I do not want to hurt you unnecessarily; but I wish there to be no\r\npossible misconception in the matter.  Now that I have discovered my\r\nerror I am not likely to fall into it again; and that you may not have\r\nany error at all, I tell you now again, that I have not loved you, do not\r\nlove you, and never will and never can love you.'  Here an idea struck\r\nLeonard and he blurted out:\r\n\r\n'But do you not think that something is due to me?'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean?'  Her brows were puckered with real wonder this time.\r\n\r\n'For false hopes raised in my mind.  If I did not love you before, the\r\nvery act of proposing to me has made me love you; and now I love you so\r\nwell that I cannot live without you!'  In his genuine agitation he was\r\nstarting up, when the sight of her hand laid upon the gong arrested him.\r\nShe laughed as she said:\r\n\r\n'I thought that the privilege of changing one's mind was a female\r\nprerogative!  Besides, I have done already something to make reparation\r\nto you for the wrong of . . . of--I may put it fairly, as the suggestion\r\nis your own--of not having treated you as a woman!'\r\n\r\n'Damn!'\r\n\r\n'As you observe so gracefully, it is annoying to have one's own silly\r\nwords come back at one, boomerang fashion.  I made up my mind to do\r\nsomething for you; to pay off your debts.'  This so exasperated him that\r\nhe said out brutally:\r\n\r\n'No thanks to you for that!  As I had to put up with the patronage and\r\nthe lecturings, and the eyeglass of that infernal old woman, I don't\r\nintend . . . '\r\n\r\nStephen stood up, her hand upon the gong:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Everard, if you do not remember that you are in my drawing-room, and\r\nspeaking of my dear and respected aunt, I shall not detain you longer!'\r\n\r\nHe sat down at once, saying surlily:\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon.  I forgot.  You make me so wild that--that . . . '  He\r\nchewed the ends of his moustache angrily.  She resumed her seat, taking\r\nher hand from the gong.  Without further pause she continued:\r\n\r\n'Quite right!  It has been Miss Rowly who paid your debts.  At first I\r\nhad promised myself the pleasure; but from something in your speech and\r\nmanner she thought it better that such an act should not be done by a\r\nwoman in my position to a man in yours.  It might, if made public, have\r\ncreated quite a wrong impression in the minds of many of our friends.'\r\n\r\nThere was something like a snort from Leonard.  She ignored it:\r\n\r\n'So she paid the money herself out of her own fortune.  And, indeed, I\r\nmust say that you do not seem to have treated her with much gratitude.'\r\n\r\n'What did I say or do that put you off doing the thing yourself?'\r\n\r\n'I shall answer it frankly: It was because you manifested, several times,\r\nin a manner there was no mistaking, both by words and deeds, an intention\r\nof levying blackmail on me by using your knowledge of my ridiculous,\r\nunmaidenly act.  No one can despise, or deplore, or condemn that act more\r\nthan I do; so that rather than yield a single point to you, I am, if\r\nnecessary, ready to face the odium which the public knowledge of it might\r\nproduce.  What I had intended to do for you in the way of compensation\r\nfor false hopes raised to you by that act has now been done.  That it was\r\ndone by my aunt on my behalf, and not by me, matters to you no more than\r\nit did to your creditors, who, when they received the money, made no\r\ncomplaint of injury to their feelings on that account.\r\n\r\n'Now, when you think the whole matter over in quietness, you will,\r\nknowing that I am ready at any time to face if necessary the unpleasant\r\npublicity, be able to estimate what damage you would do to yourself by\r\nany expose.  It seems to me that you would come out of it pretty badly\r\nall round.  That, however, is not my affair; it entirely rests with\r\nyourself.  I think I know how women would regard it.  I dare say you best\r\nknow how men would look at it; and at you!'\r\n\r\nLeonard knew already how the only man who knew of it had taken it, and\r\nthe knowledge did not reassure him!\r\n\r\n'You jade!  You infernal, devilish, cruel, smooth-tongued jade!'  He\r\nstood as bespoke.  She stood too, and stood watching him with her hand on\r\nthe gong.  After a pause of a couple of seconds she said gravely:\r\n\r\n'One other thing I should wish to say, and I mean it.  Understand me\r\nclearly, that I mean it!  You must not come again into my grounds without\r\nmy special permission.  I shall not allow my liberty to be taken away, or\r\nrestricted, by you.  If there be need at any time to come to the house,\r\ncome in ceremonious fashion, by the avenues which are used by others.  You\r\ncan always speak to me in public, or socially, in the most friendly\r\nmanner; as I shall hope to be able to speak to you.  But you must never\r\ntransgress the ordinary rules of decorum.  If you do, I shall have to\r\ntake, for my own protection, another course.  I know you now!  I am\r\nwilling to blot out the past; but it must be the whole past that is wiped\r\nout!'\r\n\r\nShe stood facing him; and as he looked at her clear-cut aquiline face,\r\nher steady eyes, her resolute mouth, her carriage, masterly in its self-\r\npossessed poise, he saw that there was no further hope for him.  There\r\nwas no love and no fear.\r\n\r\n'You devil!' he hissed.\r\n\r\nShe struck the gong; her aunt entered the room.\r\n\r\n'Oh, is that you, Auntie?  Mr. Everard has finished his business with\r\nme!'  Then to the servant, who had entered after Miss Rowly:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Everard would like his carriage.  By the way,' she added, turning to\r\nhim in a friendly way as an afterthought, 'will you not stay, Mr.\r\nEverard, and take lunch with us?  My aunt has been rather moping lately;\r\nI am sure your presence would cheer her up.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, do stay, Mr. Everard!' added Miss Rowly placidly.  'It would make a\r\npleasant hour for us all.'\r\n\r\nLeonard, with a great effort, said with conventional politeness:\r\n\r\n'Thanks, awfully!  But I promised my father to be home for lunch!' and he\r\nwithdrew to the door which the servant held open.\r\n\r\nHe went out filled with anger and despair, and, sad for him, with a\r\nfierce, overmastering desire--love he called it--for the clever, proud,\r\nimperious beauty who had so outmatched and crushed him.\r\n\r\nThat beautiful red head, which he had at first so despised, was\r\nhenceforth to blaze in his dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII--THE MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the _Scoriac_ Harold An Wolf, now John Robinson, kept aloof from every\r\none.  He did not make any acquaintances, did not try to.  Some of those\r\nat table with him, being ladies and gentlemen, now and again made a\r\npolite remark; to which he answered with equal politeness.  Being what he\r\nwas he could not willingly offend any one; and there was nothing in his\r\nmanner to repel any kindly overture to acquaintance.  But this was the\r\nfull length his acquaintanceship went; so he gradually felt himself\r\npractically alone.  This was just what he wished; he sat all day silent\r\nand alone, or else walked up and down the great deck that ran from stem\r\nto stern, still always alone.  As there were no second-class or steerage\r\npassengers on the _Scoriac_, there were no deck restraints, and so there\r\nwas ample room for individual solitude.  The travellers, however, were a\r\nsociable lot, and a general feeling of friendliness was abroad.  The\r\nfirst four days of the journey were ideally fine, and life was a joy.  The\r\ngreat ship, with bilge keels, was as steady as a rock.\r\n\r\nAmong the other passengers was an American family consisting of Andrew\r\nStonehouse, the great ironmaster and contractor, with his wife and little\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nStonehouse was a remarkable man in his way, a typical product of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon under American conditions.  He had started in young manhood\r\nwith nothing but a good education, due in chief to his own industry and\r\nhis having taken advantage to the full of such opportunities as life had\r\nafforded to him.  By unremitting work he had at thirty achieved a great\r\nfortune, which had, however; been up to then entirely invested and\r\ninvolved in his businesses.  With, however, the colossal plant at his\r\ndisposal, and by aid of the fine character he had won for honesty and\r\ngood work, he was able within the next ten years to pile up a fortune\r\nvast even in a nation where multi-millionaires are scattered freely.  Then\r\nhe had married, wisely and happily.  But no child had come to crown the\r\nhappiness of the pair who so loved each other till a good many years had\r\ncome and gone.  Then, when the hope of issue had almost passed away, a\r\nlittle daughter came.  Naturally the child was idolised by her parents,\r\nand thereafter every step taken by either was with an eye to her good.\r\nWhen the rigour of winter and the heat of summer told on the child in a\r\nway which the more hardy parents had never felt, she was whirled away to\r\nsome place with more promising conditions of health and happiness.  When\r\nthe doctors hinted that an ocean voyage and a winter in Italy would be\r\ngood, those too were duly undertaken.  And now, the child being in\r\nperfect health, the family was returning before the weather should get\r\ntoo hot to spend the summer at their chalet amongst the great pines on\r\nthe slopes of Mount Ranier.  Like the others on board, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nStonehouse had proffered travellers' civilities to the sad, lonely young\r\nman.  As to the others, he had shown thanks for their gracious courtesy;\r\nbut friendship, as in other cases, did not advance.  The Stonehouses were\r\nnot in any way chagrined; their lives were too happy and too full for\r\nthem to take needless offence.  They respected the young man's manifest\r\ndesire for privacy; and there, so far as they were concerned, the matter\r\nrested.\r\n\r\nBut this did not suit the child.  Pearl was a sweet little thing, a real\r\nblue-eyed, golden-haired little fairy, full of loving-kindness.  All the\r\nmother-instinct in her, and even at six a woman-child can be a\r\nmother--theoretically, went out towards the huge, lonely, sad, silent\r\nyoung man.  She insisted on friendship with him; insisted shamelessly,\r\nwith the natural inclination of innocence which rises high above shame.\r\nEven the half-hearted protests of the mother, who loved to see the child\r\nhappy, did not deter her; after the second occasion of Pearl's seeking\r\nhim, as she persisted, Harold could but remonstrate with the mother in\r\nturn; the ease of the gentle lady and the happiness of her child were\r\nmore or less at stake.  When Mrs. Stonehouse would say:\r\n\r\n'There, darling!  You must be careful not to annoy the gentleman,' Pearl\r\nwould turn a rosy all-commanding face to her and answer:\r\n\r\n'But, mother, I want him to play with me.  You must play with me!'  Then,\r\nas the mother would look at him, he would say quickly, and with genuine\r\nheartiness too:\r\n\r\n'Oh please, madam, do let her play with me!  Come, Pearl, shall you ride\r\na cock-horse or go to market the way the gentleman rides?'  Then the\r\nchild would spring on his knee with a cry of delight, and their games\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the child and her loving ways were unutterably sweet to\r\nHarold; but his pleasure was always followed by a pain that rent him as\r\nhe thought of that other little one, now so far away, and of those times\r\nthat seemed so long since gone.\r\n\r\nBut the child never relaxed in her efforts to please; and in the long\r\nhours of the sea voyage the friendship between her and the man grew, and\r\ngrew.  He was the biggest and strongest and therefore most lovely thing\r\non board the ship, and that sufficed her.  As for him, the child\r\nmanifestly loved and trusted him, and that was all-in-all to his weary,\r\ndesolate heart.\r\n\r\nThe fifth day out the weather began to change; the waves grew more and\r\nmore mountainous as the day wore on and the ship advanced west.  Not even\r\nthe great bulk and weight of the ship, which ordinarily drove through the\r\nseas without pitch or roll, were proof against waves so gigantic.  Then\r\nthe wind grew fiercer and fiercer, coming in roaring squalls from the\r\nsouth-west.  Most of those on board were alarmed, for the great waves\r\nwere dreadful to see, and the sound of the wind was a trumpet-call to\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nThe sick stayed in their cabins; the rest found an interest if not a\r\npleasure on deck.  Among the latter were the Stonehouses, who were old\r\ntravellers.  Even Pearl had already had more sea-voyages than fall to\r\nmost people in their lives.  As for Harold, the storm seemed to come\r\nquite naturally to him and he paced the deck like a ship-master.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for the passengers that most of them had at this period\r\nof the voyage got their sea legs; otherwise walking on the slippery deck,\r\nthat seemed to heave as the rolling of the vessel threw its slopes up or\r\ndown, would have been impossible.  Pearl was, like most children, pretty\r\nsure-footed; holding fast to Harold's hand she managed to move about\r\nceaselessly.  She absolutely refused to go with any one else.  When her\r\nmother said that she had better sit still she answered:\r\n\r\n'But, mother, I am quite safe with The Man!'  'The Man' was the name she\r\nhad given Harold, and by which she always now spoke of him.  They had had\r\na good many turns together, and Harold had, with the captain's\r\npermission, taken her up on the bridge and showed her how to look out\r\nover the 'dodger' without the wind hurting her eyes.  Then came the\r\nwelcome beef-tea hour, and all who had come on deck were cheered and\r\nwarmed with the hot soup.  Pearl went below, and Harold, in the shelter\r\nof the charthouse, together with a good many others, looked out over the\r\nwild sea.\r\n\r\nHarold, despite the wild turmoil of winds and seas around him, which\r\nusually lifted his spirits, was sad, feeling lonely and wretched; he was\r\nsuffering from the recoil of his little friend's charming presence.  Pearl\r\ncame on deck again looking for him.  He did not see her, and the child,\r\nseeing an opening for a new game, avoided both her father and mother, who\r\nalso stood in the shelter of the charthouse, and ran round behind it on\r\nthe weather side, calling a loud 'Boo!' to attract Harold's attention as\r\nshe ran.\r\n\r\nA few seconds later the _Scoriac_ put her nose into a coming wave at just\r\nthe angle which makes for the full exercise of the opposing forces.  The\r\ngreat wave seemed to strike the ship on the port quarter like a giant\r\nhammer; and for an instant she stood still, trembling.  Then the top of\r\nthe wave seemed to leap up and deluge her.  The wind took the flying\r\nwater and threw it high in volumes of broken spray, which swept not only\r\nthe deck but the rigging as high as the top of the funnels.  The child\r\nsaw the mass of water coming, and shrieking flew round the port side of\r\nthe charthouse.  But just as she turned down the open space between it\r\nand the funnel the vessel rolled to starboard.  At the same moment came a\r\npuff of wind of greater violence than ever.  The child, calling out, half\r\nin simulated half in real fear, flew down the slope.  As she did so the\r\ngale took her, and in an instant whirled her, almost touching her mother,\r\nover the rail into the sea.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stonehouse shrieked and sprang forward as though to follow her\r\nchild.  She was held back by the strong arm of her husband.  They both\r\nslipped on the sloping deck and fell together into the scuppers.  There\r\nwas a chorus of screams from all the women present.  Harold, with an\r\ninstinctive understanding of the dangers yet to be encountered, seized a\r\nred tam-o'-shanter from the head of a young girl who stood near.\r\n\r\nHer exclamation of surprise was drowned in the fearful cry 'Man\r\noverboard!' and all rushed down to the rail and saw Harold, as he emerged\r\nfrom the water, pull the red cap over his head and then swim desperately\r\ntowards the child, whose golden hair was spread on the rising wave.\r\n\r\nThe instant after Pearl's being swept overboard might be seen the\r\nsplendid discipline of a well-ordered ship.  Every man to his post, and\r\nevery man with a knowledge of his duty.  The First Officer called to the\r\nQuartermaster at the wheel in a voice which cut through the gale like a\r\ntrumpet:\r\n\r\n'Hard a port!  Hard!'\r\n\r\nThe stern of the great ship swung away to port in time to clear the\r\nfloating child from the whirling screw, which would have cut her to\r\npieces in an instant.  Then the Officer after tearing the engine-room\r\nsignal to 'Starboard engine full speed astern,' ran for the lifebuoy\r\nhanging at the starboard end of the bridge.  This he hurled far into the\r\nsea.  As it fell the attached rope dragged with it the signal, which so\r\nsoon as it reaches water bursts into smoke and flame--signal by day and\r\nnight.  This done, and it had all been done in a couple of seconds, he\r\nworked the electric switch of the syren, which screamed out quickly once,\r\ntwice, thrice.  This is the dread sound which means 'man overboard,' and\r\ndraws to his post every man on the ship, waking or sleeping.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was now on the bridge and in command, and the First Officer,\r\nfreed from his duty there, ran to the emergency boat, swung out on its\r\ndavits on the port side.\r\n\r\nAll this time, though only numbered by seconds, the _Scoriac_ was turning\r\nhard to starboard, making a great figure of eight; for it is quicker to\r\nturn one of these great sea monsters round than to stop her in mid\r\ncareer.  The aim of her Captain in such cases is to bring her back to the\r\nweather side of the floating buoy before launching the boat.\r\n\r\nOn deck the anguish of the child's parents was pitiable.  Close to the\r\nrail, with her husband's arms holding her tight to it, the distressed\r\nmother leaned out; but always moving so that she was at the nearest point\r\nof the ship to her child.  As the ship passed on it became more difficult\r\nto see the heads.  In the greater distance they seemed to be quite close\r\ntogether.  All at once, just as a great wave which had hidden them in the\r\nfarther trough passed on, the mother screamed out:\r\n\r\n'She's sinking! she's sinking!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!' and she fell on her\r\nknees, her horrified eyes, set in a face of ashen grey, looking out\r\nbetween the rails.\r\n\r\nBut at the instant all eyes saw the man's figure rise in the water as he\r\nbegan to dive.  There was a hush which seemed deadly; the onlookers\r\nfeared to draw breath.  And then the mother's heart leaped and her cry\r\nrang out again as two heads rose together in the waste of sea:\r\n\r\n'He has her!  He has her!  He has her!  Oh, thank God!  Thank God!' and\r\nfor a single instant she hid her face in her hands.\r\n\r\nThen when the fierce 'hurrah' of all on board had been hushed in\r\nexpectation, the comments broke forth.  Most of the passengers had by\r\nthis time got glasses of one kind or another.\r\n\r\n'See!  He's putting the cap on the child's head.  He's a cool one that.\r\nFancy him thinking of a red cap at such a time!'\r\n\r\n'Ay! we could see that cap, when it might be we couldn't see anything\r\nelse.'\r\n\r\n'Look!' this from an old sailor standing by his boat, 'how he's raisin'\r\nin the water.  He's keeping his body between her an' the spindrift till\r\nthe squall has passed.  That would choke them both in a wind like this if\r\nhe didn't know how to guard against it.  He's all right; he is!  The\r\nlittle maid is safe wi' him.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, bless you!  Bless you for those words,' said the mother, turning\r\ntowards him.  'At this moment the Second Officer, who had run down from\r\nthe bridge, touched Mr. Stonehouse on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n'The captain asked me to tell you, sir, that you and Mrs. Stonehouse had\r\nbetter come to him on the bridge.  You'll see better from there.'\r\n\r\nThey both hurried up, and the mother again peered out with fixed eyes.\r\nThe Captain tried to comfort her; laying his strong hand on her shoulder,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n'There, there!  Take comfort, ma'am.  She is in the hands of God!  All\r\nthat mortal man can do is being done.  And she is safer with that gallant\r\nyoung giant than she could be with any other man on the ship.  Look, how\r\nhe is protecting her!  Why he knows that all that can be done is being\r\ndone.  He is waiting for us to get to him, and is saving himself for it.\r\nAny other man who didn't know so much about swimming as he does would try\r\nto reach the lifebuoy; and would choke the two of them with the spindrift\r\nin the trying.  Mind how he took the red cap to help us see them.  He's a\r\nfine lad that; a gallant lad!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV--FROM THE DEEPS\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently the Captain handed Mrs. Stonehouse a pair of binoculars.  For\r\nan instant she looked through them, then handed them back and continued\r\ngazing out to where the two heads appeared--when they did appear on the\r\ncrest of the waves like pin-heads.  The Captain said half to himself and\r\nhalf to the father:\r\n\r\n'Mother's eyes!  Mother's eyes!' and the father understood.\r\n\r\nAs the ship swept back to the rescue, her funnels sending out huge\r\nvolumes of smoke which the gale beat down on the sea to leeward, the\r\nexcitement grew tenser and tenser.  Men dared hardly breathe; women wept\r\nand clasped their hands convulsively as they prayed.  In the emergency\r\nboat the men sat like statues, their oars upright, ready for instant use.\r\nThe officer stood with the falls in his hand ready to lower away.\r\n\r\nWhen opposite the lifebuoy, and about a furlong from Harold and Pearl,\r\nthe Captain gave the signal 'Stop,' and then a second later: 'Full speed\r\nastern.'\r\n\r\n'Ready, men!  Steady!'  As the coming wave slipping under the ship began\r\nto rise up her side, the officer freed the falls and the boat sank softly\r\ninto the lifting sea.\r\n\r\nInstantly the oars struck the water, and as the men bent to them a cheer\r\nrang out.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nHarold and Pearl heard, and the man turning his head for a moment saw\r\nthat the ship was close at hand, gradually drifting down to the weather\r\nside of them.  He raised the child in his arms, saying:\r\n\r\n'Now, Pearl, wave your hand to mother and say, hurrah!'  The child, fired\r\ninto fresh hope, waved her tiny hand and cried 'Hurrah!  Hurrah!'  The\r\nsound could not reach the mother's ears; but she saw, and her heart\r\nleaped.  She too waved her hand, but she uttered no sound.  The sweet\r\nhigh voice of the child crept over the water to the ears of the men in\r\nthe boat, and seemed to fire their arms with renewed strength.\r\n\r\nA few more strokes brought them close, Harold with a last effort raised\r\nthe child in his arms as the boat drove down on them.  The boatswain\r\nleaning over the bow grabbed the child, and with one sweep of his strong\r\narm took her into the boat.  The bow oarsman caught Harold by the wrist.\r\nThe way of the boat took him for a moment under water; but the next man;\r\npulling his oar across the boat, stooped over and caught him by the\r\ncollar, and clung fast.  A few seconds more and he was hauled abroad.  A\r\nwild cheer from all on the _Scoriac_ came, sweeping down on the wind.\r\n\r\nWhen once the boat's head had been turned towards the ship, and the oars\r\nhad bent again to their work, they came soon within shelter.  When they\r\nhad got close enough ropes were thrown out, caught and made fast; and\r\nthen came down one of the bowlines which the seamen held ready along the\r\nrail of the lower deck.  This was seized by the boatswain, who placed it\r\nround him under his armpits.  Then, standing with the child in his arms\r\nhe made ready to be pulled up.  Pearl held out her arms to Harold, crying\r\nin fear:\r\n\r\n'No, no, let The Man take me!  I want to go with The Man!'  He said\r\nquietly so as not to frighten her:\r\n\r\n'No, no, dear!  Go with him!  He can do this better than I can!'  So she\r\nclung quietly to the seaman, holding her face pressed close against his\r\nshoulder.  As the men above pulled at the rope, keeping it as far as\r\npossible from the side of the vessel, the boatswain fended himself off\r\nwith his feet.  In a few seconds he was seized by eager hands and pulled\r\nover the rail, tenderly holding and guarding the child all the while.  In\r\nan instant she was in the arms of her mother, who had thrown herself upon\r\nher knees and pressed her close to her loving heart.  The child put her\r\nlittle arms around her neck and clung to her.  Then looking up and seeing\r\nthe grey pallor of her face, which even her great joy could not in a\r\nmoment efface, she stroked it and said:\r\n\r\n'Poor mother!  Poor mother!  And now I have made you all wet!'  Then,\r\nfeeling her father's hand on her head she turned and leaped into his\r\narms, where he held her close.\r\n\r\nHarold was the next to ascend.  He came amid a regular tempest of cheers,\r\nthe seamen joining with the passengers.  The officers, led by the Captain\r\nwaving his cap from the bridge, joined in the paean.\r\n\r\nThe boat was cast loose.  An instant after the engine bells tinkled:\r\n'Full speed ahead.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Stonehouse had no eyes but for her child, except for one other.  When\r\nHarold leaped down from the rail she rushed at him, all those around\r\ninstinctively making way for her.  She flung her arms around him and\r\nkissed him, and then before he could stop her sank to her knees at his\r\nfeet, and taking his hand kissed it.  Harold was embarrassed beyond all\r\nthinking.  He tried to take away his hand, but she clung tight to it.\r\n\r\n'No, no!' she cried.  'You saved my child!'\r\n\r\nHarold was a gentleman and a kindly one.  He said no word till she had\r\nrisen, still holding his hand, when he said quietly:\r\n\r\n'There! there!  Don't cry.  I was only too happy to be of service.  Any\r\nother man on board would have done the same.  I was the nearest, and\r\ntherefore had to be first.  That was all!'\r\n\r\nMr. Stonehouse came to him and said as he grasped Harold's hand so hard\r\nthat his fingers ached:\r\n\r\n'I cannot thank you as I would.  But you are a man and will understand.\r\nGod be good to you as you have been good to my child; and to her mother\r\nand myself!'  As he turned away Pearl, who had now been holding close to\r\nher mother's hand, sprang to him holding up her arms.  He raised her up\r\nand kissed her.  Then he placed her back in her mother's arms.\r\n\r\nAll at once she broke down as the recollection of danger swept back upon\r\nher.  'Oh, Mother!  Mother!' she cried, with a long, low wail, which\r\ntouched every one of her hearers to the heart's core.\r\n\r\n'The hot blankets are all ready.  Come, there is not a moment to be lost.\r\nI'll be with you when I have seen the men attended to!'\r\n\r\nSo the mother, holding her in her arms and steadied by two seamen lest\r\nshe should slip on the wet and slippery deck, took the child below.\r\n\r\nHarold was taken by another set of men, who rubbed him down till he\r\nglowed, and poured hot brandy and water into him till he had to almost\r\nuse force against the superabundance of their friendly ministrations.\r\n\r\nFor the remainder of that day a sort of solemn gladness ruled on the\r\n_Scoriac_.  The Stonehouse family remained in their suite, content in\r\nglad thankfulness to be with Pearl, who lay well covered up on the sofa\r\nsleeping off the effects of the excitement and the immersion, and the\r\nresult of the potation which the Doctor had forced upon her.  Harold was\r\nsimply shy, and objecting to the publicity which he felt to be his fate,\r\nremained in his cabin till the trumpet had blown the dinner call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV--A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Harold went back to his cabin; locking himself in, he lay\r\ndown on the sofa.  The gloom of his great sorrow was heavy on him; the\r\nreaction from the excitement of the morning had come.\r\n\r\nHe was recalled to himself by a gentle tapping.  Unlocking and opening\r\nthe door he saw Mr. Stonehouse, who said with trouble in his voice:\r\n\r\n'I came to you on account of my little child.'  There he stopped with a\r\nbreak in his voice.  Harold, with intent to set his mind at ease and to\r\nstave off further expressions of gratitude, replied:\r\n\r\n'Oh, pray don't say anything.  I am only too glad that I was privileged\r\nto be of service.  I only trust that the dear little girl is no worse for\r\nher--her adventure!'\r\n\r\n'That is why I am here,' said the father quickly.  'My wife and I are\r\nloth to trouble you.  But the poor little thing has worked herself into a\r\nparoxysm of fright and is calling for you.  We have tried in vain to\r\ncomfort or reassure her.  She will not be satisfied without you.  She\r\nkeeps calling on \"The Man\" to come and help her.  I am loth to put you to\r\nfurther strain after all you have gone through to-day; but if you would\r\ncome--'  Harold was already in the passage as he spoke:\r\n\r\n'Of course I'm coming.  If I can in any way help it is both a pleasure\r\nand a duty to be with her.'  Turning to the father he added:\r\n\r\n'She is indeed a very sweet and good child.  I shall never forget how she\r\nbore herself whilst we waited for aid to come.'\r\n\r\n'You must tell her mother and me all about it,' said the father; much\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\nWhen they came close to the Stonehouses' suite of rooms they heard\r\nPearl's voice rising with a pitiful note of fear:\r\n\r\n'Where is The Man?  Oh! where is The Man?  Why doesn't he come to me?  He\r\ncan save me!  I want to be with The Man!'  When the door opened and she\r\nsaw him she gave shriek of delight, and springing from the arms of her\r\nmother fairly leaped into Harold's arms which were outstretched to\r\nreceive her.  She clung to him and kissed him again and again, rubbing\r\nher little hands all over his face as though to prove to herself that he\r\nwas real and not a dream.  Then with a sigh she laid her head on his\r\nbreast, the reaction of sleep coming all at once to her.  With a gesture\r\nof silence Harold sat down, holding the child in his arms.  Her mother\r\nlaid a thick shawl over and sat down close to Harold.  Mr. Stonehouse\r\nstood quiet in the doorway with the child's nurse peering anxiously over\r\nhis shoulder.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, when he thought she was asleep, Harold rose and\r\nbegan to place her gently in the bunk.  But the moment he did so she\r\nwaked with a scream.  The fright in her eyes was terrible.  She clung to\r\nhim, moaning and crying out between her sobs:\r\n\r\n'Don't leave me!  Don't leave me!  Don't leave me!'  Harold was much\r\nmoved and held the little thing tight in his strong arms, saying to her:\r\n\r\n'No darling!  I shan't leave you!  Look in my eyes, dear, and I will\r\npromise you, and then you will be happy.  Won't you?'\r\n\r\nShe looked quickly up in his face.  Then she kissed him lovingly, and\r\nrested her head, but not sleepily this time, on his breast said:\r\n\r\n'Yes!  I'm not afraid now!  I'm going to stay with The Man!'  Presently\r\nMrs. Stonehouse, who had been thinking of ways and means, and of the\r\ncomfort of the strange man who had been so good to her child, said:\r\n\r\n'You will sleep with mother to-night, darling.  Mr. . . . The Man,' she\r\nsaid this with an appealing look of apology to Harold, 'The Man will stay\r\nby you till you are asleep . . . '  But she interrupted, not fretfully or\r\nargumentatively, but with a settled air of content:\r\n\r\n'No!  I'm going to sleep with The Man!'\r\n\r\n'But, dear one,' the mother expostulated, 'The Man will want sleep too.'\r\n\r\n'All right, mother.  He can sleep too.  I'll be very good and lie quite\r\nquiet; but oh! mother, I can't sleep unless his arms are round me.  I'm\r\nafraid if they're not the sea will get me!' and she clung closer to\r\nHarold, tightening her arms round his neck.\r\n\r\n'You will not mind?' asked Mrs. Stonehouse timidly to Harold; and, seeing\r\nacquiescence in his face, added in a burst of tearful gratitude:\r\n\r\n'Oh! you are good to her to us all!'\r\n\r\n'Hush!' Harold said quietly.  Then he said to Pearl, in a cheerful matter-\r\nof-fact way which carried conviction to the child's mind:\r\n\r\n'Now, darling, it is time for all good little girls to be asleep,\r\nespecially when they have had an--an interesting day.  You wait here till\r\nI put my pyjamas on, and then I'll come back for you.  And mother and\r\nfather shall come and see you nicely tucked in!'\r\n\r\n'Don't be long!' the child anxiously called after him as he hurried away.\r\nEven trust can have its doubts.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Harold was back, in pyjamas and slipper and a dressing-\r\ngown.  Pearl, already wrapped in a warm shawl by her mother, held out her\r\narms to Harold, who lifted her.\r\n\r\nThe Stonehouses' suite of rooms was close to the top of the companion-\r\nway, and as Harold's stateroom was on the saloon deck, the little\r\nprocession had, much to the man's concern, run the gauntlet of the thong\r\nof passengers whom the bad weather had kept indoors.  When he came out of\r\nthe day cabin carrying the child there was a rush of all the women to\r\nmake much of the little girl.  They were all very kind and no\r\ntroublesome; their interest was natural enough, and Harold stopped whilst\r\nthey petted the little thing.\r\n\r\nThe little procession followed.  Mr. and Mrs. Stonehouse coming next, and\r\nlast the nurse, who manifested a phase of the anxiety of a hen who sees\r\nher foster ducklings waddling toward a pond.\r\n\r\nWhen Harold was in his bunk the little maid was brought in.\r\n\r\nWhen they had all gone and the cabin was dark, save for the gleam from\r\nthe nightlight which the careful mother had placed out of sight in the\r\nbasin at the foot of the bunk, Harold lay a long time in a negative\r\nstate, if such be possible, in so far as thought was concerned.\r\n\r\nPresently he became conscious of a movement of the child his arms; a\r\nshuddering movement, and a sort of smothered groan.  The little thing was\r\nliving over again in sleep the perils and fears of the day.  Instinctively\r\nshe put up her hands and felt the a round her.  Then with a sigh clasped\r\nher arms round his neck, and with a peaceful look laid her head upon his\r\nbreast.  Even through the gates of sleep her instinct had recognised and\r\nrealised protection.\r\n\r\nAnd then this trust of a little child brought back the man to his nobler\r\nself.  Once again came back to him that love which he had had, and which\r\nhe knew now that he had never lost, for the little child that he had seen\r\ngrow into full womanhood; whose image must dwell in his heart of hearts\r\nfor evermore.\r\n\r\nThe long night's sleep quite restored Pearl.  She woke fairly early and\r\nwithout any recurrence of fear.  At first she lay still, fearing she\r\nwould wake The Man, but finding that he was awake--he had not slept a\r\nwink all night--she kissed him and then scrambled out of bed.\r\n\r\nIt was still early morning, but early hours rule on shipland.  Harold\r\nrang for the steward, and when the man came he told him to tell Mr.\r\nStonehouse that the child was awake.  His delight when he found the child\r\nunfrightened looking out of the port was unbounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI--A NOBLE OFFER\r\n\r\n\r\nThat day Harold passed in unutterable gloom.  The reaction was strong on\r\nhim; and all his woe, his bitter remembrance of the past and his\r\ndesolation for the future, were with him unceasingly.\r\n\r\nIn the dusk of the evening he wandered out to his favourite spot, the\r\ncable-tank on top of the aft wheelhouse.  Here he had been all alone, and\r\nhis loneliness had the added advantage that from the isolated elevation\r\nhe could see if anyone approached.  He had been out there during the day,\r\nand the Captain, who had noticed his habit had had rigged up a canvas\r\ndodger on the rail on the weather side.  When he sat down on the coiled\r\nhawsers in the tank he was both secluded and sheltered.  In this peaceful\r\ncorner his thoughts ran freely and in sympathy with the turmoil of wind\r\nand wave.\r\n\r\nHow unfair it all was!  Why had he been singled out for such misery?  What\r\ngleam of hope or comfort was left to his miserable life since he had\r\nheard the words of Stephen; those dreadful words which had shattered in\r\nan instant all the cherished hopes of his life.  Too well he remembered\r\nthe tone and look of scorn with which the horrible truths had been\r\nconveyed to him.  In his inmost soul he accepted them as truths;\r\nStephen's soul had framed them and Stephen's lips had sent them forth.\r\n\r\nFrom his position behind the screen he did not see the approaching figure\r\nof Mr. Stonehouse, and was astonished when he saw his head rise above the\r\nedge of the tank as he climbed the straight Jacob's ladder behind the\r\nwheelhouse.  The elder man paused as he saw him and said in an apologetic\r\nway:\r\n\r\n'Will you forgive my intruding on your privacy?  I wanted to speak to you\r\nalone; and as I saw you come here a while ago I thought it would be a\r\ngood opportunity.'  Harold was rising as he spoke.\r\n\r\n'By all means.  This place is common property.  But all the same I am\r\nhonoured in your seeking me.'  The poor fellow wished to be genial; but\r\ndespite his efforts there was a strange formality in the expression of\r\nhis words.  The elder man understood, and said as he hurried forward and\r\nsank beside him:\r\n\r\n'Pray don't stir!  Why, what a cosy corner this is.  I don't believe at\r\nthis moment there is such peace in the ship!'\r\n\r\nOnce again the bitterness of Harold's heart broke out in sudden words:\r\n\r\n'I hope not!  There is no soul on board to whom I could wish such evil!'\r\nThe old man said as he laid his hand softly on the other's shoulder:\r\n\r\n'God help you, my poor boy, if such pain is in your heart!'  Mr.\r\nStonehouse looked out at the sea, at last turning his face to him again\r\nhe spoke:\r\n\r\n'If you feel that I intrude on you I earnestly ask you to forgive me; but\r\nI think that the years between your age and mine as well as my feeling\r\ntowards the great obligation which I owe you will plead for excuse.  There\r\nis something I would like to say to you, sir; but I suppose I must not\r\nwithout your permission.  May I have it?'\r\n\r\n'If you wish, sir.  I can at least hear it.'\r\n\r\nThe old man bowed and went on:\r\n\r\n'I could not but notice that you have some great grief bearing upon you;\r\nand from one thing or another--I can tell you the data if you wish me to\r\ndo so--I have come to the conclusion that you are leaving your native\r\nland because of it.'  Here Harold, wakened to amazement by the readiness\r\nwith which his secret had been divined, said quickly, rather as an\r\nexclamation than interrogation:\r\n\r\n'How on earth did you know that!'  His companion, taking it as a query,\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n'Sir, at your age and with your strength life should be a joy; and yet\r\nyou are sad: Companionship should be a pleasure; yet you prefer solitude.\r\nThat you are brave and unselfish I know; I have reason, thank God! to\r\nknow it.  That you are kindly and tolerant is apparent from your bearing\r\nto my little child this morning; as well as your goodness of last night,\r\nthe remembrance of which her mother and I will bear to our graves; and to\r\nme now.  I have not lived all these years without having had trouble in\r\nmy own heart; and although the happiness of late years has made it dim,\r\nmy gratitude to you who are so sad brings it all back to me.'  He bowed,\r\nand Harold, wishing to avoid speaking of his sorrow, said:\r\n\r\n'You are quite right so far as I have a sorrow; and it is because of it I\r\nhave turned my back on home.  Let it rest at that!'  His companion bowed\r\ngravely and went on.\r\n\r\n'I take it that you are going to begin life afresh in the new country.  In\r\nsuch case I have a proposition to make.  I have a large business; a\r\nbusiness so large that I am unable to manage it all myself.  I was\r\nintending that when I arrived at home I would set about finding a\r\npartner.  The man I want is not an ordinary man.  He must have brains and\r\nstrength and daring.'  He paused.  Harold felt what was coming, but\r\nrealised, as he jumped at the conclusion, that it would not do for him to\r\ntake for granted that he was the man sought.  He waited; Mr. Stonehouse\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n'As to brains, I am prepared to take the existence of such on my own\r\njudgment.  I have been reading men, and in this aspect specially, all my\r\nlife.  The man I have thought of has brains.  I am satisfied of that,\r\nwithout proof.  I have proof of the other qualities.'  He paused again;\r\nas Harold said nothing he continued in a manner ill at ease:\r\n\r\n'My difficulty is to make the proposal to the man I want.  It is so\r\ndifficult to talk business to a man to whom you under great obligation;\r\nto whom you owe everything.  He might take a friendly overture ill.'\r\nThere was but one thing to be said and Harold said it.  His heart warmed\r\nto the kindly old man and he wished to spare him pain; even if he could\r\nnot accept him proposition:\r\n\r\n'He couldn't take it ill; unless he was an awful bounder.'\r\n\r\n'It was you I thought of!'\r\n\r\n'I thought so much, sir;' said Harold after a pause, 'and I thank you\r\nearnestly and honestly.  But it is impossible.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, my dear sir!' said the other, chagrined as well as surprised.  'Think\r\nagain!  It is really worth your while to think of it, no matter what your\r\nultimate decision may be!'\r\n\r\nHarold shook his head.  There was a long silence.  The old man wished to\r\ngive his companion time to think; and indeed he thought that Harold was\r\nweighing the proposition in his mind.  As for Harold, he was thinking how\r\nbest he could make his absolute refusal inoffensive.  He must, he felt,\r\ngive some reason; and his thoughts were bent on how much of the truth he\r\ncould safely give without endangering his secret.  Therefore he spoke at\r\nlast in general terms:\r\n\r\n'I can only ask you, sir, to bear with me and to believe that I am very\r\ntruly and sincerely grateful to you for your trust.  But the fact is, I\r\ncannot go anywhere amongst people.  Of course you understand that I am\r\nspeaking in confidence; to you alone and to none other?'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely!' said Mr. Stonehouse gravely.  Harold went on:\r\n\r\n'I must be alone.  I can only bear to see people on this ship because it\r\nis a necessary way to solitude.'\r\n\r\n'You \"cannot go anywhere amongst people\"!  Pardon me.  I don't wish to be\r\nunduly inquisitive; but on my word I fail to understand!'  Harold was in\r\na great difficulty.  Common courtesy alone forbade that he should leave\r\nthe matter where it was; and in addition both the magnificently generous\r\noffer which had been made to him, and the way in which accident had\r\nthrown him to such close intimacy with Pearl's family, required that he\r\nshould be at least fairly frank.  At last in a sort of cold desperation\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n'I cannot meet anyone . . . There it something that happened . . .\r\nSomething I did . . . Nothing can make it right . . . All I can do is to\r\nlose myself in the wildest, grimmest, wilderness in the world; and fight\r\nmy pain . . . my shame . . . !'\r\n\r\nA long silence.  Then the old man's voice came clear and sweet, something\r\nlike music, in the shelter from the storm:\r\n\r\n'But perhaps time may mend things.  God is very good . . . !'  Harold\r\nanswered out of the bitterness of his heart.  He felt that his words were\r\nladen with an anger which he did not feel, but he did not see his way to\r\nalter them:\r\n\r\n'Nothing can mend this thing!  It is at the farthest point of evil; and\r\nthere is no going on or coming back.  Nothing can wipe out what is done;\r\nwhat is past!'\r\n\r\nAgain silence, and again the strong, gentle voice:\r\n\r\n'God can do much!  Oh my dear young friend, you who have been such a\r\nfriend to me and mine, think of this.'\r\n\r\n'God Himself can do nothing here!  It is done!  And that is the end!'  He\r\nturned his head; it was all he could do to keep from groaning.  The old\r\nman's voice vibrated with earnest conviction as he spoke:\r\n\r\n'You are young and strong and brave!  Your heart is noble!  You can think\r\nquickly in moments of peril; therefore your brain is sound and alert.\r\nNow, may I ask you a favour? it is not much.  Only that you will listen,\r\nwithout interruption, to what, if I have your permission, I am going to\r\nsay.  Do not ask me anything; do not deny; do not interrupt!  Only\r\nlisten!  May I ask this?'\r\n\r\n'By all means!  It is not much!' he almost felt like smiling as he spoke.\r\nMr. Stonehouse, after a short pause, as if arranging his thoughts, spoke:\r\n\r\n'Let me tell you what I am.  I began life with nothing but a fair\r\neducation such as all our American boys get.  But from a good mother I\r\ngot an idea that to be honest was the best of all things; from a\r\nstrenuous father, who, however, could not do well for himself, I learned\r\napplication to work and how best to use and exercise such powers as were\r\nin me.  From the start things prospered with me.  Men who knew me trusted\r\nme; some came with offers to share in my enterprise.  Thus I had command\r\nof what capital I could use; I was able to undertake great works and to\r\ncarry them through.  Fortune kept growing and growing; for as I got\r\nwealthier I found newer and larger and more productive uses for my money.\r\nAnd in all my work I can say before God I never willingly wronged any\r\nman.  I am proud to be able to say that my name stands good wherever it\r\nhas been used.  It may seem egotistical that I say such things of myself.\r\nIt may seem bad taste; but I speak because I have a motive in so doing.  I\r\nwant you to understand at the outset that in my own country, wherever I\r\nam known and in my own work, my name is a strength.'\r\n\r\nHe paused a while.  Harold sat still; he knew that such man would not,\r\ncould not, speak in such a way without a strong motive; and to learn that\r\nmotive he waited.\r\n\r\n'When you were in the water making what headway you could in that awful\r\nsea--when my little child's life hung in the balance, and the anguish of\r\nmy wife's heart nearly tore my heart in two, I said to myself, \"If we had\r\na son I should wish him to be like that.\"  I meant it then, and I mean it\r\nnow!  Come to me as you are!  Faults, and past, and all.  Forget the\r\npast!  Whatever it was we will together try to wipe it out.  Much may be\r\ndone in restoring where there has been any wrong-doing.  Take my name as\r\nyour own.  It will protect you from the result of what ever has been, and\r\ngive you an opportunity to find your place again.  You are not bad in\r\nheart I know.  Whatever you have done has not been from base motives.  Few\r\nof us are spotless as to facts.  You and I will show ourselves--for\r\nunless God wills to the opposite we shall confide in none other--that a\r\nstrong, brave man may win back all that was lost.  Let me call you by my\r\nname and hold you as the son of my heart; and it will be a joy and\r\npleasure to my declining years.'\r\n\r\nAs he had spoken, Harold's thought's had at first followed in some\r\nwonderment.  But gradually, as his noble purpose unfolded, based as it\r\nwas on a misconception as to the misdoing of which he himself had spoken,\r\nhe had been almost stricken dumb.  At the first realisation of what was\r\nintended he could not have spoken had he tried; but at the end he had\r\nregained his thoughts and his voice.  There was still wonderment in it,\r\nas realising from the long pause that the old man had completed his\r\nsuggestion, he spoke:\r\n\r\n'If I understand aright you are offering me your name!  Offering to share\r\nyour honour with me.  With me, whom, if again I understand, you take as\r\nhaving committed some crime?'\r\n\r\n'I inferred from what you said and from your sadness, your desire to shun\r\nyour kind, that there was, if not a crime, some fault which needed\r\nexpiation.'\r\n\r\n'But your honour, sir; your honour!'  There was a proud look in the old\r\nman's eyes as he said quietly:\r\n\r\n'It was my desire, is my desire, to share with you what I have that is\r\nbest; and that, I take it, is not the least valuable of my possessions,\r\nsuch as they are!  And why not?  You have given to me all that makes life\r\nsweet; without which it would be unbearable.  That child who came to my\r\nwife and me when I was old and she had passed her youth is all in all to\r\nus both.  Had your strength and courage been for barter in the moments\r\nwhen my child was quivering between life and death, I would have\r\ncheerfully purchased them with not half but all!  Sir, I should have\r\ngiven my soul!  I can say this now, for gratitude is above all barter;\r\nand surely it is allowed to a father to show gratitude for the life of\r\nhis child!'\r\n\r\nThis great-hearted generosity touched Harold to the quick.  He could\r\nhardly speak for a few minutes.  Then instinctively grasping the old\r\nman's hand he said:\r\n\r\n'You overwhelm me.  Such noble trust and generosity as you have shown me\r\ndemands a return of trust.  But I must think!  Will you remain here and\r\nlet me return to you in a little while?'\r\n\r\nHe rose quickly and slipped down the iron ladder, passing into the\r\ndarkness and the mist and the flying spray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII--AGE'S WISDOM\r\n\r\n\r\nHarold went to and fro on the deserted deck.  All at once the course he\r\nhad to pursue opened out before him.  He was aware that what the noble-\r\nminded old man offered him was fortune, great fortune in any part of the\r\nworld.  He would have to be refused, but the refusal should be gently\r\ndone.  He, believing that the other had done something very wrong, had\r\nstill offered to share with him his name, his honour.  Such confidence\r\ndemanded full confidence in return; the unwritten laws which governed the\r\nmen amongst whom he had been brought up required it.\r\n\r\nAnd the shape that confidence should take?  He must first disabuse his\r\nnew friend's mind of criminal or unworthy cause for his going away.  For\r\nthe sake of his own name and that of his dead father that should be done.\r\nThen he would have to suggest the real cause . . . He would in this have\r\nto trust Mr. Stonehouse's honour for secrecy.  But he was worthy of\r\ntrust.  He would, of course, give no name, no clue; but he would put\r\nthings generally in a way that he could understand.\r\n\r\nWhen his mind was so far made up he wanted to finish the matter, so he\r\nturned to the wheelhouse and climbed the ladder again.  It was not till\r\nhe sat in the shelter by his companion that he became aware that he had\r\nbecome wet with the spray.  The old man wishing to help him in his\r\nembarrassment said:\r\n\r\n'Well?' Harold began at once; the straightforward habit of his life stood\r\nto him now:\r\n\r\n'Let me say first, sir, what will I know give you pleasure.'  The old man\r\nextended his hand; he had been hoping for acceptance, and this seemed\r\nlike it.  Harold laid his hand on it for an instant only, and then raised\r\nit as if to say 'Wait':\r\n\r\n'You have been so good to me, so nobly generous in your wishes that I\r\nfeel I owe you a certain confidence.  But as it concerns not myself alone\r\nI will ask that it be kept a secret between us two.  Not to be told to\r\nany other; not even your wife!'\r\n\r\n'I will hold your secret sacred.  Even from my wife; the first secret I\r\nshall have ever kept from her.'\r\n\r\n'First, then, let me say, and this is what I know will rejoice you, that\r\nI am not leaving home and country because of any crime I have committed;\r\nnot from any offence against God or man, or law.  Thank God! I am free\r\nfrom such.  I have always tried to live uprightly . . . '  Here a burst\r\nof pain overcame him, and with a dry sob he added: 'And that is what\r\nmakes the terrible unfairness of it all!'\r\n\r\nThe old man laid a kindly hand on his shoulder and kept it there for a\r\nfew moments.\r\n\r\n'My poor boy!  My poor boy!' was all he said.  Harold shook himself as if\r\nto dislodge the bitter thoughts.  Mastering himself he went on:\r\n\r\n'There was a lady with whom I was very much thrown in contact since we\r\nwere children.  Her father was my father's friend.  My friend too, God\r\nknows; for almost with his dying breath he gave sanction to my marrying\r\nhis daughter, if it should ever be that she should care for me in that\r\nway.  But he wished me to wait, and, till she was old enough to choose,\r\nto leave her free.  For she is several years younger than I am; and I am\r\nnot very old yet--except in heart!  All this, you understand, was said in\r\nprivate to me; none other knew it.  None knew of it even till this moment\r\nwhen I tell you that such a thing has been.'  He paused; the other said:\r\n\r\n'Believe me that I value your confidence, beyond all words!'  Harold felt\r\nalready the good effects of being able to speak of his pent-up trouble.\r\nAlready this freedom from the nightmare loneliness of his own thoughts\r\nseemed to be freeing his very soul.\r\n\r\n'I honestly kept to his wishes.  Before God, I did!  No man who loved a\r\nwoman, honoured her, worshipped her, could have been more scrupulously\r\ncareful as to leaving her free.  What it was to me to so hold myself no\r\none knows; no one ever will know.  For I loved her, do love her, with\r\nevery nerve and fibre of my heart.  All our lives we had been friends;\r\nand I believed we loved and trusted each other.  But . . . but then there\r\ncame a day when I found by chance that a great trouble threatened her.\r\nNot from anything wrong that she had done; but from something perhaps\r\nfoolish, harmlessly foolish except that she did not know . . . '  He\r\nstopped suddenly, fearing he might have said overmuch of Stephen's side\r\nof the affair.  'When I came to her aid, however, meaning the best, and\r\nas single-minded as a man can be, she misunderstood my words, my meaning,\r\nmy very coming; and she said things which cannot be unsaid.  Things . . .\r\nmatters were so fixed that I could not explain; and I had to listen.  She\r\nsaid things that I did not believe she could have said to me, to anyone.\r\nThings that I did not think she could have thought . . . I dare say she\r\nwas right in some ways.  I suppose I bungled in my desire to be\r\nunselfish.  What she said came to me in new lights upon what I had done\r\n. . . But anyhow her statements were such that I felt I could not, should\r\nnot, remain.  My very presence must have been a trouble to her hereafter.\r\nThere was nothing for it but to come away.  There was no place for me!  No\r\nhope for me!  There is none on this side of the grave! . . . For I love\r\nher still, more than ever.  I honour and worship her still, and ever\r\nwill, and ever must! . . . I am content to forego my own happiness; but I\r\nfeel there is a danger to her from what has been.  That there is and must\r\nbe to her unhappiness even from the fact that it was I who was the object\r\nof her wrath; and this adds to my woe.  Worst of all is . . . the thought\r\nand the memory that she should have done so; she who . . . she . . . '\r\n\r\nHe turned away overcome and hid his face in his hands.  The old man sat\r\nstill; he knew that at such a moment silence is the best form of\r\nsympathy.  But his heart glowed; the wisdom of his years told him that he\r\nhad heard as yet of no absolute bar to his friend's ultimate happiness.\r\n\r\n'I am rejoiced, my dear boy, at what you tell me of your own conduct.  It\r\nwould have made no difference to me had it been otherwise.  But it would\r\nhave meant a harder and longer climb back to the place you should hold.\r\nBut it really seems that nothing is so hopeless as you think.  Believe\r\nme, my dear young friend who are now as a son to my heart, that there\r\nwill be bright days for you yet . . . '  He paused a moment, but\r\nmastering himself went on in a quiet voice:\r\n\r\n'I think you are wise to go away.  In the solitudes and in danger things\r\nthat are little in reality will find their true perspective; and things\r\nthat are worthy will appear in their constant majesty.'\r\n\r\nHe stood, and laying once again his hand on the young man's shoulder\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'I recognise that I--that we, for my wife and little girl would be at one\r\nwith me in my wish, did they know of it, must not keep you from your\r\npurpose of fighting out your trouble alone.  Every man, as the Scotch\r\nproverb says, must \"dree his own weird.\"  I shall not, I must not, ask\r\nyou for any promise; but I trust that if ever you do come back you will\r\nmake us all glad by seeing you.  And remember that what I said of myself\r\nand of all I have--all--holds good so long as I shall live!'\r\n\r\nBefore Harold could reply he had slipped down the ladder and was gone.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of the voyage, with the exception of one occasion, he did\r\nnot allude to the subject again by word or implication, and Harold was\r\ngrateful to him for it.\r\n\r\nOn the night before Fire Island should be sighted Harold was in the bow\r\nof the great ship looking out with eyes in which gleamed no hope.  To him\r\ncame through the darkness Mr. Stonehouse.  He heard the footsteps and\r\nknew them; so with the instinct of courtesy, knowing that his friend\r\nwould not intrude on his solitude without purpose, he turned and met him.\r\nWhen the American stood beside him he said, studiously avoiding looking\r\nat his companion:\r\n\r\n'This is the last night we shall be together, and, if I may, there is one\r\nthing I would like to say to you.'\r\n\r\n'Say all you like, sir,' said Harold as heartily as he could, 'I am sure\r\nit is well meant; and for that at any rate I shall be grateful to you.'\r\n\r\n'You will yet be grateful, I think!' he answered gravely.  'When it comes\r\nback to you in loneliness and solitude you will, I believe, think it\r\nworth being grateful for.  I don't mean that you will be grateful to me,\r\nbut for the thing itself.  I speak out of the wisdom of many years.  At\r\nyour time of life the knowledge cannot come from observation.  It may my\r\npoor boy, come through pain; and if what I think is correct you will even\r\nin due time be grateful to the pain which left such golden residuum.'  He\r\npaused, and Harold grew interested.  There was something in the old man's\r\nmanner which presaged a truth; he, at least, believed it.  So the young\r\nman listened at first with his ears; and as the other spoke, his heart\r\nlistened too:\r\n\r\n'Young men are apt to think somewhat wrongly of women they love and\r\nrespect.  We are apt to think that such women are of a different clay\r\nfrom ourselves.  Nay! that they are not compact of clay at all, but of\r\nsome faultless, flawless material which the Almighty keeps for such fine\r\nwork.  It is only in middle age that men--except scamps, who learn this\r\nbad side of knowledge young--realise that women are human beings like\r\nthemselves.  It may be, you know, that you may have misjudged this young\r\nlady!  That you have not made sufficient allowance for her youth, her\r\nnature, even the circumstances under which she spoke.  You have told me\r\nthat she was in some deep grief or trouble.  May it not have been that\r\nthis in itself unnerved her, distorted her views, aroused her passion\r\ntill all within and around was tinged with the jaundice of her concern,\r\nher humiliation--whatever it was that destroyed for the time that normal\r\nself which you had known so long.  May it not have been that her\r\nbitterest memory even since may be of the speaking of these very words\r\nwhich sent you out into the wide world to hide yourself from men.  I have\r\nthought, waking and sleeping, of your position ever since you honoured me\r\nwith your confidence; and with every hour the conviction has strengthened\r\nin me that there is a way out of this situation which sends a man like\r\nyou into solitude with a heart hopeless and full of pain; and which\r\nleaves her perhaps in greater pain, for she has not like you the complete\r\nsense of innocence.  But at present there is no way out but through time\r\nand thought.  Whatever may be her ideas or wishes she is powerless.  She\r\ndoes not know your thoughts, no matter how she may guess at them.  She\r\ndoes not know where you are or how to reach you, no matter how complete\r\nher penitence may be.  And oh! my dear young friend, remember that you\r\nare a strong man, and she is a woman.  Only a woman in her passion and\r\nher weakness after all.  Think this all over, my poor boy!  You will have\r\ntime and opportunity where you are going.  God help you to judge wisely!'\r\nAfter a pause of a few seconds he said abruptly: 'Good night!' and moved\r\nquickly away.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nWhen the time for parting came Pearl was inconsolable.  Not knowing any\r\nreason why The Man should not do as she wished she was persistent in her\r\npetitions to Harold that he should come with her, and to her father and\r\nmother that they should induce him to do so.  Mrs. Stonehouse would have\r\nwished him to join them if only for a time.  Her husband, unable to give\r\nany hint without betraying confidence, had to content himself with trying\r\nto appease his little daughter by vague hopes rather than promises that\r\nher friend would join them at some other time.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Scoriac_ was warped at the pier there was a tendency on the\r\npart of the passengers to give Harold a sort of public send-off; but\r\nbecoming aware of it he hurried down the gangway without waiting.  Having\r\nonly hand luggage, for he was to get his equipment in New York, he had\r\ncleared and passed the ring of customs officers before the most\r\nexpeditious of the other passengers had collected their baggage.  He had\r\nsaid good-bye to the Stonehouses in their own cabin.  Pearl had been so\r\nmuch affected at saying good-bye, and his heart had so warmed to her,\r\nthat at last he had said impulsively:\r\n\r\n'Don't cry, darling.  If I am spared I shall come back to you within\r\nthree years.  Perhaps I will write before then; but there are not many\r\npost-offices where I am going to!'\r\n\r\nChildren are easily satisfied.  Their trust makes a promise a real thing;\r\nand its acceptance is the beginning of satisfaction.  But for weeks after\r\nthe parting she had often fits of deep depression, and at such times her\r\ntears always flowed.  She took note of the date, and there was never a\r\nday that she did not think of and sigh for The Man.\r\n\r\nAnd The Man, away in the wilds of Alaska, was feeling, day by day and\r\nhour by hour, the chastening and purifying influences of the wilderness.\r\nHot passions cooled before the breath of the snowfield and the glacier.\r\nThe moaning of a tortured spirit was lost in the roar of the avalanche\r\nand the scream of the cyclone.  Pale sorrow and cold despair were warmed\r\nand quickened by the fierce sunlight which came suddenly and stayed only\r\nlong enough to vitalise all nature.\r\n\r\nAnd as the first step to understanding, The Man forgot himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII--DE LANNOY\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years!\r\n\r\nNot much to look back upon, but a world to look forward to.  To Stephen,\r\ndowered though she was with rare personal gifts and with wealth and\r\nposition accorded to but few, the hours of waiting were longer than the\r\nyears that were past.  Yet the time had new and startling incidents for\r\nher.  Towards Christmas in the second year the Boer war had reached its\r\nclimax of evil.  As the news of disaster after disaster was flashed\r\nthrough the cable she like others felt appalled at the sacrifices that\r\nwere being exacted by the God of War.\r\n\r\nOne day she casually read in The Times that the Earl de Lannoy had died\r\nin his London mansion, and further learned that he had never recovered\r\nfrom the shock of hearing that his two sons and his nephew had been\r\nkilled.  The paragraph concluded: \"By his death the title passes to a\r\ndistant relative.  The new Lord de Lannoy is at present in India with his\r\nregiment, the 35th or 'Grey' Hussars, of which he is Colonel.\"  She gave\r\nthe matter a more than passing thought, for it was sad to find a whole\r\nfamily thus wiped out at a blow.\r\n\r\nEarly in February she received a telegram from her London solicitor\r\nsaying that he wished to see her on an important matter.  Her answer was:\r\n\"Come at once\"; and at tea-time Mr. Copleston arrived.  He was an old\r\nfriend and she greeted him warmly.  She was a little chilled when he\r\nanswered with what seemed unusual deference:\r\n\r\n'I thank your Ladyship for your kindness!'  She raised her eyebrows but\r\nmade no comment: she was learning to be silent under surprise.  When she\r\nhad handed the old gentleman his tea she said:\r\n\r\n'My aunt has chosen to remain away, thinking that you might wish to see\r\nme privately.  But I take it that there is nothing which she may not\r\nshare.  I have no secrets from her.'\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his hands genially as he replied:\r\n\r\n'Not at all; not at all!  I should like her to be present.  It will, I am\r\nsure, be a delight to us all.'\r\n\r\nAgain raised eyebrows; again silence on the subject.  When a servant\r\nanswered her bell she told him to ask Miss Rowly if she would kindly join\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAunt Laetitia and the solicitor were old cronies, and their greeting was\r\nmost friendly.  When the old gentlewoman had seated herself and taken her\r\ncup of tea, Mr. Copleston said to Stephen, with a sort of pomposity:\r\n\r\n'I have to announce your succession to the Earldom de Lannoy!'\r\n\r\nStephen sat quite still.  She knew the news was true; Mr. Copleston was\r\nnot one who would jest on a business subject, and too accurate a lawyer\r\nto make an error in a matter of fact.  But the fact did not seem to touch\r\nher.  It was not that she was indifferent to it; few women could hear\r\nsuch news without a thrill.  Mr. Copleston seemed at a loss.  Miss Rowly\r\nrose and quietly kissed her, and saying simply, 'God bless you, my dear!'\r\nwent back to her seat.\r\n\r\nRealising that Mr. Copleston expected some acknowledgment, Stephen held\r\nout her hand to him and said quietly:\r\n\r\n'Thank you!'\r\n\r\nAfter a long pause she added quietly:\r\n\r\n'Now, won't you tell us about it?  I am in absolute ignorance; and don't\r\nunderstand.'\r\n\r\n'I had better not burden you, at first, with too many details, which can\r\ncome later; but give you a rough survey of the situation.'\r\n\r\n'Your title of Countess de Lannoy comes to you through your ancestor\r\nIsobel, third and youngest daughter of the sixth Earl; Messrs Collinbrae\r\nand Jackson, knowing that my firm acted for your family, communicated\r\nwith us.  Lest there should be any error we followed most carefully every\r\ndescendant and every branch of the family, for we thought it best not to\r\ncommunicate with you till your right of inheritance was beyond dispute.\r\nWe arrived independently at the same result as Messrs. Collinbrae and\r\nJackson.  There is absolutely no doubt whatever of your claim.  You will\r\npetition the Crown, and on reference to the House of Lords the Committee\r\nfor Privileges will admit your right.  May I offer my congratulations,\r\nLady de Lannoy on your acquisition?  By the way, I may say that all the\r\nestates of the Earldom, which have been from the first kept in strict\r\nentail, go with the title de Lannoy.'\r\n\r\nDuring the recital Stephen was conscious of a sort of bitter comment on\r\nthe tendencies of good fortune.\r\n\r\n'Too late! too late!' something seemed to whisper, 'what delight it would\r\nhave been had Father inherited . . . If Harold had not gone . . . !'  All\r\nthe natural joy seemed to vanish, as bubbles break into empty air.\r\n\r\nTo Aunt Laetitia the new title was a source of pride and joy, far greater\r\nthan would have been the case had it come to herself.  She had for so\r\nmany years longed for new honours for Stephen that she had almost come to\r\nregard them as a right whose coming should not be too long delayed.  Miss\r\nRowly had never been to Lannoy; and, indeed, she knew personally nothing\r\nof the county Angleshire in which it was situated.  She was naturally\r\nanxious to see the new domain; but kept her feeling concealed during the\r\nmonths that elapsed until Stephen's right had been conceded by the\r\nCommittee for Privileges.  But after that her impatience became manifest\r\nto Stephen, who said one day in a teasing, caressing way, as was\r\nsometimes her wont:\r\n\r\n'Why, Auntie, what a hurry you are in!  Lannoy will keep, won't it?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, my dear,' she replied, shaking her head, 'I can understand your own\r\nreticence, for you don't want to seem greedy and in a hurry about your\r\nnew possessions.  But when people come to my age there's no time to\r\nwaste.  I feel I would not have complete material for happiness in the\r\nWorld-to-come, if there were not a remembrance of my darling in her new\r\nhome!'\r\n\r\nStephen was much touched; she said impulsively:\r\n\r\n'We shall go to-morrow, Auntie.  No!  Let us go to-day.  You shall not\r\nwait an hour that I can help!'  She ran to the bell; but before her hand\r\nwas on the cord the other said:\r\n\r\n'Not yet!  Stephen dear.  It would flurry me to start all at once; to-\r\nmorrow will be time enough.  And that will give you time to send word so\r\nthat they will be prepared for your coming.'\r\n\r\nHow often do we look for that to-morrow which never comes?  How often do\r\nwe find that its looked-for rosy tints are none other than the\r\ngloom-laden grey of the present?\r\n\r\nBefore the morrow's sun was high in the heavens Stephen was hurriedly\r\nsummoned to her aunt's bedside.  She lay calm and peaceful; but one side\r\nof her face was alive and the other seemingly dead.  In the night a\r\nparalytic stroke had seized her.  The doctors said she might in time\r\nrecover a little, but she would never be her old active self again.  She\r\nherself, with much painful effort, managed to convey to Stephen that she\r\nknew the end was near.  Stephen, knowing the wish of her heart and\r\nthinking that it might do her good to gratify her wish, asked if she\r\nshould arrange that she be brought to Lannoy.  Feebly and slowly, word by\r\nword, she managed to convey her idea.\r\n\r\n'Not now, dear one.  I shall see it all in time!--Soon!  And I shall\r\nunderstand and rejoice!'  For a long time she lay still, holding with her\r\nright hand, which was not paralysed, the other's hand.  Then she\r\nmurmured:\r\n\r\n'You will find happiness there!'  She said no more; but seemed to sleep.\r\n\r\nFrom that sleep she never woke, but faded slowly, softly away.\r\n\r\nStephen was broken-hearted.  Now, indeed, she felt alone and desolate.\r\nAll were gone.  Father, uncle, aunt!--And  Harold.  The kingdoms of the\r\nEarth which lay at her feet were of no account.  One hour of the dead or\r\ndeparted, any of them, back again were worth them all!\r\n\r\nNormanstand was now too utterly lonely to be endurable; so Stephen\r\ndetermined to go, for a time at any rate, to Lannoy.  She was becoming\r\naccustomed to be called 'my lady' and 'your ladyship,' and the new\r\nloneness made her feel better prepared to take her place amongst new\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there was another spur to her going.  Leonard Everard,\r\nknowing of her absolute loneliness, and feeling that in it was a\r\npossibility of renewing his old status, was beginning to make himself\r\napparent.  He had learned by experience a certain wisdom, and did not put\r\nhimself forward obtrusively.  But whenever they met he looked at her so\r\nmeekly and so lovingly that it brought remembrances which came with\r\nblushes.  So, all at once, without giving time for the news to permeate\r\nthrough the neighbourhood, she took her way to Lannoy with a few\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nStephen's life had hitherto been spent inland.  She had of course now and\r\nagain been for short periods to various places; but the wonder of the sea\r\nas a constant companion had been practically unknown to her.\r\n\r\nNow at her new home its full splendour burst upon her; and so impressed\r\nitself upon her that new life seemed to open.\r\n\r\nLannoy was on the north-eastern coast, the castle standing at the base of\r\na wide promontory stretching far into the North Sea.  From the coast the\r\nland sloped upward to a great rolling ridge.  The outlook seaward was\r\nover a mighty expanse of green sward, dotted here and there with woods\r\nand isolated clumps of trees which grew fewer and smaller as the rigour\r\nof the northern sea was borne upon them by the easterly gales.\r\n\r\nThe coast was a wild and lonely one.  No habitation other than an\r\nisolated fisher's cottage was to be seen between the little fishing-port\r\nat the northern curve away to the south, where beyond a waste of\r\nsandhills and strand another tiny fishing-village nestled under a high\r\ncliff, sheltering it from northerly wind.  For centuries the lords of\r\nLannoy had kept their magnificent prospect to themselves; and though they\r\nhad treated their farmers and cottagers well, none had ever been allowed\r\nto settle in the great park to seaward of the castle.\r\n\r\nFrom the terrace of the castle only than one building, other than the\r\ncottage on the headland, could be seen.  Far off on the very crest of the\r\nridge was the tower of an old windmill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX--THE SILVER LADY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it was known that Lady de Lannoy had come to Lannoy there was a\r\nprompt rush of such callers as the county afforded.  Stephen, however,\r\ndid not wish to see anyone just at present.  Partly to avoid the chance\r\nmeeting with strangers, and partly because she enjoyed and benefited by\r\nthe exercise, she was much away from home every day.  Sometimes, attended\r\nonly by a groom, she rode long distances north or south along the coast;\r\nor up over the ridge behind the castle and far inland along the shaded\r\nroads through the woods; or over bleak wind-swept stretches of moorland.\r\nSometimes she would walk, all alone, far down to the sea-road, and would\r\nsit for hours on the shore or high up on some little rocky headland where\r\nshe could enjoy the luxury of solitude.\r\n\r\nNow and again in her journeyings she made friends, most of them humble\r\nones.  She was so great a lady in her station that she could be familiar\r\nwithout seeming to condescend.  The fishermen of the little ports to\r\nnorth and south came to know her, and to look gladly for her coming.\r\nTheir goodwives had for her always a willing curtsy and a ready smile.  As\r\nfor the children, they looked on her with admiration and love, tempered\r\nwith awe.  She was so gentle with them, so ready to share their pleasures\r\nand interests, that after a while they came to regard her as some strange\r\nembodiment of Fairydom and Dreamland.  Many a little heart was made glad\r\nby the arrival of some item of delight from the Castle; and the hearts of\r\nthe sick seemed never to hope, or their eyes to look, in vain.\r\n\r\nOne friend she made who became very dear and of great import.  Often she\r\nhad looked up at the old windmill on the crest of the ridge and wondered\r\nwho inhabited it; for that some one lived in it, or close by, was shown\r\nat times by the drifting smoke.  One day she made up her mind to go and\r\nsee for herself.  She had a fancy not to ask anyone about it.  The place\r\nwas a little item of mystery; and as such to be treasured and exploited,\r\nand in due course explored.  The mill itself was picturesque, and the\r\ndetail at closer acquaintance sustained the far-off impression.  The\r\nroadway forked on the near side of the mill, reuniting again the further\r\nside, so that the place made a sort of island--mill, out-offices and\r\ngarden.  As the mill was on the very top of the ridge the garden which\r\nlay seawards was sheltered by the building from the west, and from the\r\neast by a thick hedge of thorn and privet, which quite hid it from the\r\nroadway.  Stephen took the lower road.  Finding no entrance save a locked\r\nwooden door she followed round to the western side, where the business\r\nside of the mill had been.  It was all still now and silent, and that it\r\nhad long fallen into disuse was shown by the grey faded look of\r\neverything.  Grass, green and luxuriant, grew untrodden between the\r\ncobble-stones with which the yard was paved.  There was a sort of old-\r\nworld quietude about everything which greatly appealed to Stephen.\r\n\r\nStephen dismounted and walked round the yard admiring everything.  She\r\ndid not feel as if intruding; for the gateway was wide open.\r\n\r\nA low door in the base of the mill tower opened, and a maid appeared, a\r\ndemure pretty little thing of sixteen or seventeen years, dressed in a\r\nprim strait dress and an old-fashioned Puritan cap.  Seeing a stranger,\r\nshe made an ejaculation and drew back hastily.  Stephen called out to\r\nher:\r\n\r\n'Don't be afraid, little girl!  Will you kindly tell me who lives here?'\r\nThe answer came with some hesitation:\r\n\r\n'Sister Ruth.'\r\n\r\n'And who is Sister Ruth?'  The question came instinctively and without\r\npremeditation.  The maid, embarrassed, held hard to the half-open door\r\nand shifted from foot to foot uneasily.\r\n\r\n'I don't know!' she said at last.  'Only Sister Ruth, I suppose!'  It was\r\nmanifest that the matter had never afforded her anything in the nature of\r\na problem.  There was an embarrassing silence.  Stephen did not wish to\r\nseem, or even to be, prying; but her curiosity was aroused.  What manner\r\nof woman was this who lived so manifestly alone, and who had but a\r\nChristian name!  Stephen, however, had all her life been accustomed to\r\ndominance, and at Normanstand and Norwood had made many acquaintances\r\namongst her poorer neighbours.  She was just about to ask if she might\r\nsee Sister Ruth, when behind the maid in the dark of the low passage-way\r\nappeared the tall, slim figure of a silver woman.  Truly a silver woman!\r\nThe first flash of Stephen's thought was correct.  White-haired, white-\r\nfaced, white-capped, white-kerchiefed; in a plain-cut dress of light-grey\r\nsilk, without adornment of any kind.  The whole ensemble was as a piece\r\nof old silver.  The lines of her face were very dignified, very sweet,\r\nvery beautiful.  Stephen felt at once that she was in the presence of no\r\ncommon woman.  She looked an admiration which all her Quaker garments\r\ncould not forbid the other to feel.  She was not the first to speak; in\r\nsuch a noble presence the dignity of Stephen's youth imperatively\r\ndemanded silence, if not humility.  So she waited.  The Silver Lady, for\r\nso Stephen ever after held her in her mind, said quietly, but with\r\nmanifest welcome:\r\n\r\n'Didst thou wish to see me?  Wilt thou come in?'  Stephen answered\r\nfrankly:\r\n\r\n'I should like to come in; if you will not think me rude.  The fact is, I\r\nwas struck when riding by with the beautiful situation of the mill.  I\r\nthought it was only an old mill till I saw the garden hedges; and I came\r\nround to ask if I might go in.'  The  Silver Lady came forward at a pace\r\nthat by itself expressed warmth as she said heartily:\r\n\r\n'Indeed thou mayest.  Stay! it is tea-time.  Let us put thy horse in one\r\nof the sheds; there is no man here at present to do it.  Then thou shalt\r\ncome with me and see my beautiful view!'  She was about to take the horse\r\nherself, but Stephen forestalled her with a quick: 'No, no! pray let me.\r\nI am quite accustomed.'  She led the horse to a shed, and having looped\r\nthe rein over a hook, patted him and ran back.  The Silver Lady gave her\r\na hand, and they entered the dark passage together.\r\n\r\nStephen was thinking if she ought to begin by telling her name.  But the\r\nHaroun al Raschid feeling for adventure incognito is an innate principle\r\nof the sons of men.  It was seldom indeed that her life had afforded her\r\nsuch an opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Lady on her own part also wished for silence, as she looked\r\nfor the effect on her companion when the glory of the view should break\r\nupon her.  When they had climbed the winding stone stair, which led up\r\nsome twenty feet, there was a low wide landing with the remains of the\r\nmain shaft of the mill machinery running through it.  From one side rose\r\na stone stair curving with the outer wall of the mill tower and guarded\r\nby a heavy iron rail.  A dozen steps there were, and then a landing a\r\ncouple of yards square; then a deep doorway cut in the thickness of the\r\nwall, round which the winding stair continued.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Lady, who had led the way, threw open the door, and motioned\r\nto her guest to enter.  Stephen stood for a few moments, surprised as\r\nwell as delighted, for the room before her as not like anything which she\r\nhad ever seen or thought of.\r\n\r\nIt was a section of almost the whole tower, and was of considerable size,\r\nfor the machinery and even the inner shaft had been removed.  East and\r\nsouth and west the wall had been partially cut away so that great wide\r\nwindows nearly the full height of the room showed the magnificent\r\npanorama.  In the depths of the ample windows were little cloistered\r\nnooks where one might with a feeling of super-solitude be away from and\r\nabove the world.\r\n\r\nThe room was beautifully furnished and everywhere were flowers, with\r\nleaves and sprays and branches where possible.\r\n\r\nEven from where she stood in the doorway Stephen had a bird's-eye view of\r\nthe whole countryside; not only of the coast, with which she was already\r\nfamiliar, and on which her windows at the Castle looked, but to the south\r\nand west, which the hill rising steep behind the castle and to southward\r\nshut out.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Lady could not but notice her guest's genuine admiration.\r\n\r\n'Thou likest my room and my view.  There is no use asking thee, I see\r\nthou dost!'  Stephen answered with a little gasp.\r\n\r\n'I think it is the quaintest and most beautiful place I have ever seen!'\r\n\r\n'I am so glad thou likest it.  I have lived here for nearly forty years;\r\nand they have been years of unutterable peace and earthly happiness!  And\r\nnow, thou wilt have some tea!'\r\n\r\nStephen left the mill that afternoon with a warmth of heart that she had\r\nbeen a stranger to for many a day.  The two women had accepted each other\r\nsimply.  'I am called Ruth,' said the Silver Lady.  'And I am Stephen,'\r\nsaid the Countess de Lannoy in reply.  And that was all; neither had any\r\nclue to the other's identity.  Stephen felt that some story lay behind\r\nthat calm, sweet personality; much sorrow goes to the making of fearless\r\nquietude.  The Quaker lady moved so little out of her own environment\r\nthat she did not even suspect the identity of her visitor.  All that she\r\nknew of change was a notice from the solicitor to the estate that, as the\r\nheadship had lapsed into another branch of the possessing family, she\r\nmust be prepared, if necessary, to vacate her tenancy, which was one 'at\r\nwill.'\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Stephen availed herself of the permission to come\r\nagain.  This time she made up her mind to tell who she was, lest the\r\nconcealment of her identity might lead to awkwardness.  At that meeting\r\nfriendship became union.\r\n\r\nThe natures of the two women expanded to each other; and after a very few\r\nmeetings there was established between them a rare confidence.  Even the\r\npersonal austerity of Quakerdom, or the state and estate of the peeress,\r\ncould not come between.  Their friendship seemed to be for the life of\r\none.  To the other it would be a memory.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Lady never left the chosen routine of her own life.  Whatever\r\nwas the reason of her giving up the world, she kept it to herself; and\r\nStephen respected her reticence as much as she did her confidence.\r\n\r\nIt had become a habit, early in their friendship, for Stephen to ride or\r\nwalk over to the windmill in the dusk of the evening when she felt\r\nespecially lonely.  On one such occasion she pushed open the outer door,\r\nwhich was never shut, and took her way up the stone stair.  She knew she\r\nwould find her friend seated in the window with hands folded on lap,\r\nlooking out into the silent dusk with that absorbed understanding of\r\nthings which is holier than reverence, and spiritually more active than\r\nconscious prayer.\r\n\r\nShe tapped the door lightly, and stepped into the room.\r\n\r\nWith a glad exclamation, which coming through her habitual sedateness\r\nshowed how much she loved the young girl, Sister Ruth started to her\r\nfeet.  There was something of such truth in the note she had sounded,\r\nthat the lonely girl's heart went out to her in abandoned fulness.  She\r\nheld out her arms; and, as she came close to the other, fell rather than\r\nsank at her feet.  The elder woman recognised, and knew.  She made no\r\neffort to restrain her; but sinking back into her own seat laid the\r\ngirl's head in her lap, and held her hands close against her breast.\r\n\r\n'Tell me,' she whispered.  'Won't you tell me, dear child, what troubles\r\nyou?  Tell me! dear.  It may bring peace!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I am miserable, miserable, miserable!' moaned Stephen in a low voice\r\nwhose despair made the other's heart grow cold.  The Silver Lady knew\r\nthat here golden silence was the best of help; holding close the other's\r\nhands, she waited.  Stephen's breast began to heave; with an impulsive\r\nmotion she drew away her hands and put them before her burning face,\r\nwhich she pressed lower still on the other's lap.  Sister Ruth knew that\r\nthe trouble, whatever it was, was about to find a voice.  And then came\r\nin a low shuddering whisper a voice muffled in the folds of the dress:\r\n\r\n'I killed a man!'\r\n\r\nIn all her life the Silver Lady had never been so startled or so shocked.\r\nShe had grown so to love the bright, brilliant young girl that the\r\nwhispered confession cut through the silence of the dusk as a shriek of\r\nmurder goes through the silent gloom of night.  Her hands flew wide from\r\nher breast, and the convulsive shudder which shook her all in an instant\r\nwoke Stephen through all her own deep emotion to the instinct of\r\nprotection of the other.  The girl looked up, shaking her head, and said\r\nwith a sadness which stilled all the other's fear:\r\n\r\n'Ah!  Don't be frightened!  It is not murder that I tell you of.  Perhaps\r\nif it were, the thought would be easier to bear!  He would have been hurt\r\nless if it had been only his body that I slew.  Well I know now that his\r\nlife would have been freely given if I wished it; if it had been for my\r\ngood.  But it was the best of him that I killed; his soul.  His noble,\r\nloving, trusting, unselfish soul.  The bravest and truest soul that ever\r\nhad place in a man's breast! . . . '  Her speaking ended with a sob; her\r\nbody sank lower.\r\n\r\nSister Ruth's heart began to beat more freely.  She understood now, and\r\nall the womanhood, all the wifehood, motherhood suppressed for a\r\nlifetime, awoke to the woman's need.  Gently she stroked the beautiful\r\nhead that lay so meekly on her lap; and as the girl sobbed with but\r\nlittle appearance of abatement, she said to her softly:\r\n\r\n'Tell me, dear child.  Tell me all about it!  See! we are alone together.\r\nThou and I; and God!  In God's dusk; with only the silent land and sea\r\nbefore us!  Won't thou trust me, dear one, and speak!'\r\n\r\nAnd then, as the shadows fell, and far-off lights at sea began to twinkle\r\nover the waste of waters, Stephen found voice and told without reserve\r\nthe secret of her shame and her remorse.\r\n\r\nAt last, when her broken voice had trailed away into gentle catchings of\r\nthe breath, the older woman, knowing that the time come for comfort, took\r\nher in her strong arms, holding her face wet against her own, their tears\r\nmingling.\r\n\r\n'Cry on, dear heart!' she said as she kissed her.  'Cry on!  It will do\r\nthee good!'  She was startled once again as the other seemed for an\r\ninstant to grow rigid in her arms, and raising her hands cried out in a\r\nburst of almost hysterical passion:\r\n\r\n'Cry! cry!  Oh my God! my God!'  Then becoming conscious of her wet face\r\nshe seemed to become in an instant all limp, and sank on her knees again.\r\nThere was so different a note in her voice that the other's heart leaped\r\nas she heard her say:\r\n\r\n'God be thanked for these tears!  Oh, thank God!  Thank God!'  Looking up\r\nshe saw through the gloom the surprise in her companion's eyes and\r\nanswered their query in words:\r\n\r\n'Oh! you don't know!  You can't know what it is to me!  I have not cried\r\nsince last I saw him pass from me in the wood!'\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThat time of confession seemed to have in some way cleared, purified and\r\nsatisfied Stephen's soul.  Life was now easier to bear.  She was able to\r\nadapt herself, justifiably to the needs of her position; and all around\r\nher and dependent on her began to realise that amongst them was a\r\ncontrolling force, far-reaching sympathy, and a dominant resolution that\r\nmade for good.\r\n\r\nShe began to shake off the gloom of her sorrows and to take her place in\r\nher new high station.  Friends there were in many, and quondam lovers by\r\nthe score.  Lovers of all sorts.  Fortune-hunters there were be sure, not\r\na few.  But no need was there for baseness when the lady herself was so\r\ndesirable; so young, so fair, so lovable.  That she was of great estate\r\nand 'richly left' made all things possible to any man who had sufficient\r\nacquisitiveness, or a good conceit of himself.  In a wide circle of\r\ncountry were many true-lovers who would have done aught to win her\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nAnd so in the East the passing of the two years of silence and gloom\r\nseemed to be the winning of something brighter to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX--THE LESSON OF THE WILDERNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the West the two years flew.  Time seemed to go faster there, because\r\nlife was more strenuous.  Harold, being mainly alone, found endless work\r\nalways before him.  From daylight to dark labour never ceased; and for\r\nhis own part he never wished that it should.  In the wilderness, and\r\nespecially under such conditions as held in Northern Alaska, labour is\r\nnot merely mechanical.  Every hour of the day is fraught with danger in\r\nsome new form, and the head has to play its part in the strife against\r\nnature.  In such a life there is not much time for thinking or brooding.\r\n\r\nAt first, when the work and his surroundings were strange to him, Harold\r\ndid many useless things and ran many unnecessary risks.  But his\r\nknowledge grew with experience.  Privations he had in plenty; and all the\r\nfibre of his body and the strength of his resolution and endurance were\r\nnow and again taxed to their utmost.  But with a man of his nature and\r\nrace the breaking strain is high; and endurance and resolution are\r\nqualities which develop with practice.\r\n\r\nGradually his mind came back to normal level; he had won seemingly\r\nthrough the pain that shadowed him.  Without anguish he could now think,\r\nremember, look forward.  Then it was that the kindly wisdom of the\r\nAmerican came back to him, and came to stay.  He began to examine himself\r\nas to his own part of the unhappy transaction; and stray moments of\r\nwonderment came as to whether the fault may not, at the very base, have\r\nhis own.  He began to realise that it is insufficient in this strenuous\r\nworld to watch and wait; to suppress one's self; to put aside, in the\r\nwish to benefit others, all the hopes, ambitions, cravings which make for\r\npersonal gain.\r\n\r\nThus it was that Harold's thoughts, ever circling round Stephen, came\r\nback with increasing insistence to his duty towards her.  He often\r\nthought, and with a bitter feeling against himself that it came too late,\r\nof the dying trust of her father:\r\n\r\n'Guard her and cherish her, as if you were indeed my son and she your\r\nsister . . . If it should be that you and Stephen should find that there\r\nis another affection between you remember I sanction it.  But give her\r\ntime!  I trust that to you!  She is young, and the world is all before\r\nher.  Let her choose . . . And be loyal to her, if it is another!  It may\r\nbe a hard task; but I trust you, Harold!'\r\n\r\nHere he would groan, as all the anguish of the past would rush back upon\r\nhim; and keenest of all would be the fear, suspicion, thought which grew\r\ntowards belief, that he may have betrayed that trust. . . .\r\n\r\nAt first the side of this memory personal to his own happiness was\r\nfaintly emphasised; the important side was of the duty to Stephen.  But\r\nas time went on the other thought became a sort of corollary; a timid,\r\nhalting, blushing thought which followed sheepishly, borne down by\r\ntrembling hope.  No matter what adventure came to him, the thought of\r\nneglected duty returned ever afresh.  Once, when he lay sick for weeks in\r\nan Indian wigwam, the idea so grew with each day of the monotony, that\r\nwhen he was able to crawl out by himself into the sunshine he had almost\r\nmade up his mind to start back for home.\r\n\r\nLuck is a strange thing.  It seems in some mysterious way to be the\r\ndivine machinery for adjusting averages.  Whatever may be the measure of\r\nhappiness or unhappiness, good or evil, allotted to anyone, luck is the\r\ncause or means of counter-balancing so that the main result reaches the\r\nstandard set.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Harold's illness Dame Fortune seemed to change her\r\nattitude to him.  The fierce frown, nay! the malignant scowl, to which he\r\nhad become accustomed, changed to a smile.  Hitherto everything seemed to\r\nhave gone wrong with him; but now all at once all seemed to go right.  He\r\ngrew strong and hardy again.  Indeed, he seemed by contrast to his late\r\nhelplessness to be so strong and hard that it looked as if that very\r\nillness had done him good instead of harm.  Game was plentiful, and he\r\nnever seemed to want.  Everywhere he went there were traces of gold, as\r\nthough by some instinct he was tracking it to its home.  He did not value\r\ngold for its own sake; but he did for the ardour of the search.  Harold\r\nwas essentially a man, and as a man an adventurer.  To such a man of such\r\na race adventure is the very salt of existence.\r\n\r\nThe adventurer's instinct took with it the adventurer's judgment; Harold\r\nwas not content with small results.  Amidst the vast primeval forces\r\nthere were, he felt, vast results of their prehistoric working; and he\r\ndetermined to find some of them.  In such a quest, purpose is much.  It\r\nwas hardly any wonder, then, that in time Harold found himself alone in\r\nthe midst of one of the great treasure-places of the world.  Only labour\r\nwas needed to take from the earth riches beyond the dreams of avarice.\r\nBut that labour was no easy problem; great and difficult distance had to\r\nbe overcome; secrecy must be observed, for even a whisper of the\r\nexistence of such a place would bring a horde of desperadoes.  But all\r\nthese difficulties were at least sources of interest, if not in\r\nthemselves pleasures.  The new Harold, seemingly freshly created by a\r\nyear of danger and strenuous toil, of self-examining and humiliation, of\r\nthe realisation of duty, and--though he knew it not as yet--of the\r\ndawning of hope, found delight in the thought of dangers and difficulties\r\nto be overcome.  Having taken his bearings exactly so as to be safe in\r\nfinding the place again, he took his specimens with him and set out to\r\nfind the shortest and best route to the nearest port.\r\n\r\nAt length he came to the port and set quietly about finding men.  This he\r\ndid very carefully and very systematically.  Finally, with the full\r\ncomplement, and with ample supply of stores, he started on his expedition\r\nto the new goldfields.\r\n\r\nIt is not purposed to set out here the extraordinary growth of Robinson\r\nCity, for thus the mining camp soon became.  Its history has long ago\r\nbeen told for all the world.  In the early days, when everything had to\r\nbe organised and protected, Harold worked like a giant, and with a system\r\nand energy which from the first established him as a master.  But when\r\nthe second year of his exile was coming to a close, and Robinson City was\r\nteeming with life and commerce, when banks and police and soldiers made\r\nlife and property comparatively safe, he began to be restless again.  This\r\nwas not the life to which he had set himself.  He had gone into the\r\nwilderness to be away from cities and from men; and here a city had\r\nsprung up around him and men claimed him as their chief.  Moreover, with\r\nthe restless feeling there began to come back to him the old thoughts and\r\nthe old pain.\r\n\r\nBut he felt strong enough by this time to look forward in life as well as\r\nbackward.  With him now to think was to act; so much at least he had\r\ngained from his position of dominance in an upspringing city.  He quietly\r\nconsolidated such outlying interests as he had, placed the management of\r\nhis great estate in the hands of a man he had learned to trust, and\r\ngiving out that he was going to San Francisco to arrange some business,\r\nleft Robinson City.  He had already accumulated such a fortune that the\r\nworld was before him in any way he might choose to take.\r\n\r\nKnowing that at San Francisco, to which he had booked, he would have to\r\nrun the gauntlet of certain of his friends and business connections, he\r\nmade haste to leave the ship quietly at Portland, the first point she\r\ntouched on her southern journey.  Thence he got on the Canadian Pacific\r\nLine and took his way to Montreal.\r\n\r\nWhat most arrested his attention, and in a very disconcerting way, were\r\nthe glimpses of English life one sees reproduced so faithfully here and\r\nthere in Canada.  The whole of the past rushed back on him so\r\noverpoweringly that he was for the moment unnerved.  The acute feeling of\r\ncourse soon became mitigated; but it was the beginning of a\r\nre-realisation of what had been, and which grew stronger with each mile\r\nas the train swept back eastward.\r\n\r\nAt first he tried to fight it; tried with all the resources of his strong\r\nnature.  His mind was made up, he assured himself over and over again.\r\nThe past was past, and what had been was no more to him than to any of\r\nthe other passengers of the train.  Destiny had long ago fulfilled\r\nitself.  Stephen no doubt had by now found some one worthy of her and had\r\nmarried.  In no dream, sleeping or waking, could he ever admit that she\r\nhad married Leonard; that was the only gleam of comfort in what had grown\r\nto be remorse for his neglected duty.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that Harold An Wolf slowly drifted, though he knew it not,\r\ninto something of the same intellectual position which had dominated him\r\nwhen he had started on his journeying and the sunset fell nightly on his\r\ndespairing face.  The life in the wilderness, and then in the dominance\r\nand masterdom of enterprise, had hardened and strengthened him into more\r\nself-reliant manhood, giving him greater forbearance and a more practical\r\nview of things.\r\n\r\nWhen he took ship in the _Dominion_, a large cargo-boat with some\r\npassengers running to London, he had a vague purpose of visiting in\r\nsecret Norcester, whence he could manage to find out how matters were at\r\nNormanstand.  He would then, he felt, be in a better position to regulate\r\nhis further movements.  He knew that he had already a sufficient disguise\r\nin his great beard.  He had nothing to fear from the tracing of him on\r\nhis journey from Alaska or the interest of his fellow-passengers.  He had\r\nall along been so fortunate as to be able to keep his identity concealed.\r\nThe name John Robinson told nothing in itself, and the width of a whole\r\ngreat continent lay between him and the place of his fame.  He was able\r\nto take his part freely amongst both the passengers and the officers.\r\nEven amongst the crew he soon came to be known; the men liked his\r\ngeniality, and instinctively respected his enormous strength and his\r\nmanifest force of character.  Men who work and who know danger soon learn\r\nto recognise the forces which overcome both.  And as sufficient time had\r\nnot elapsed to impair his hardihood or lower his vast strength he was\r\nfacile princeps.  And so the crew acknowledged him; to them he was a born\r\nCaptain whom to obey would be a natural duty.\r\n\r\nAfter some days the weather changed.  The great ship, which usually\r\nrested even-keeled on two waves, and whose bilge keels under normal\r\nconditions rendered rolling impossible, began to pitch and roll like a\r\nleviathan at play.  The decks, swept by gigantic seas, were injured\r\nwherever was anything to injure. Bulwarks were torn away as though they\r\nhad been compact of paper.  More than once the double doors at the head\r\nof the companion stairs had been driven in.  The bull's eye glasses of\r\nsome of the ports were beaten from their brazen sockets.  Nearly all the\r\nboats had been wrecked, broken or torn from their cranes as the great\r\nship rolled heavily in the trough, or giant waves had struck her till she\r\nquivered like a frightened horse.\r\n\r\nAt that season she sailed on the far northern course.  Driven still\r\nfarther north by the gales, she came within a short way of south of\r\nGreenland.  Then avoiding Moville, which should have been her place of\r\ncall, she ran down the east of Britain, the wild weather still\r\nprevailing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI--THE LIFE-LINE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Angleshire the weather in the early days of September had\r\nbeen stormy.  With the south-west wind had come deluges of rain, not a\r\ncommon thing for the time of year on the east coast.  Stephen, whose\r\nspirits always rose with high wind, was in a condition of prolonged\r\nexcitement.  She could not keep still; every day she rode long distances,\r\nand found a wonderful satisfaction in facing the strong winds.  Like a\r\ntrue horsewoman she did not mind the wet, and had glorious gallops over\r\nthe grassy ridge and down the slopes on the farther side, out on the open\r\nroad or through the endless grass rides amid the pine woods.\r\n\r\nOn the Tuesday morning the storm was in full sweep, and Stephen was in\r\nwild spirits.  Nothing would do her but to go out on the tower of the\r\ncastle where she could walk about, and leaning on the crenellated parapet\r\nlook over all the coast stretching far in front and sweeping away to the\r\nleft and right.  The prospect so enchanted her, and the fierce sweep of\r\nthe wind so suited her exalted mood, that she remained there all the\r\nmorning.  The whole coast was a mass of leaping foam and flying spray,\r\nand far away to the horizon white-topped waves rolled endlessly.  That\r\nday she did not even ride out, but contented herself with watching the\r\nsea and the storm from the tower.  After lunch she went to her tower\r\nagain; and again after tea.  The storm was now furious.  She made up her\r\nmind that after dinner she would ride down and see its happenings close\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished dinner she went to her room to dress for her ride.\r\nThe rush and roar of the storm were in her ears, and she was in wild\r\ntumultuous spirits.  All her youth seemed to sweep back on her; or\r\nperhaps it was that the sickness of the last two years was swept away.\r\nSomewhere deep down in Stephen's heart, below her intention or even her\r\nconsciousness, was a desire to be her old self if only for an hour.  And\r\nto this end externals were of help.  Without weighing the matter in her\r\nmind, and acting entirely on impulse, she told her maid to get the red\r\nhabit she had not worn for years.  When she was dressed she sent round to\r\nhave out her white Arab; while it was getting ready she went once more to\r\nthe tower to see the storm-effect in the darkening twilight.  As she\r\nlooked, her heart for an instant stood still.  Half-way to the horizon a\r\ngreat ship, ablaze in the bows, was driving through the waves with all\r\nher speed.  She was heading towards the little port, beyond which the\r\nshallows sent up a moving wall of white spray.\r\n\r\nStephen tore down the turret stair, and gave hurried directions to have\r\nbeds prepared in a number of rooms, fires everywhere, and plenty of\r\nprovisions.  She also ordered that carriages should be sent at once to\r\nthe fishing port with clothing and restoratives.  There would, she felt,\r\nbe need for such help before a time to be measured by minutes should have\r\npassed; and as some of her servants were as yet strange to her ways she\r\ndid not leave anything to chance.  One carriage was to go for the doctor\r\nwho lived at Lannoy, the village over the hill, whence nothing could be\r\nseen of what was happening.  She knew that others within sight or hailing\r\nwould be already on their way.  Work was afoot, and had she time, or\r\nthought of it, she would have chosen a more sedate garb.  But in the\r\nexcitement no thought of herself came to her.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds she was in the saddle, tearing at full speed down the\r\nroad that led to the port.  The wind was blowing so strongly in her face\r\nthat only in the lulls could she hear the hoof-strokes of the groom's\r\nhorse galloping behind her.\r\n\r\nAt first the height of the road allowed her to see the ship and the port\r\ntowards which she was making.  But presently the road dipped, and the\r\ncurving of the hill shut both from her sight; it was only when she came\r\nclose that she could see either again.\r\n\r\nNow the great ship was close at hand.  The flames had gained terribly,\r\nand it was a race for life or death.  There was no time do more than run\r\nher aground if life was to be saved at all.  The captain, who in the gaps\r\nof the smoke could be seen upon the bridge, knew his work well.  As he\r\ncame near the shoal he ran a little north, and then turned sharply so as\r\nto throw the boat's head to the south of the shoal.  Thus the wind would\r\ndrive fire and smoke forward and leave the after part of the vessel free\r\nfor a time.\r\n\r\nThe shock of her striking the sand was terrific, though the tinkle of the\r\nbell borne in on the gale showed that the engines had been slowed down.\r\nThe funnels were shaken down, and the masts broke off, falling forward.  A\r\nwild shriek from a hundred throats cleft the roaring of wind and wave.\r\nThe mast fell, the foremast, with all its cumbering top-hamper on the\r\nbridge, which was in an instant blotted out of existence, together with\r\nthe little band of gallant men who stood on it, true to their last duty.\r\nAs the wind took the smoke south a man was seen to climb on the wreck of\r\nthe mast aft and make fast the end of a great coil of rope which he\r\ncarried.  He was a huge man with a full dark beard.  Two sailors working\r\nwith furious haste helped him with the rope.  The waves kept raising the\r\nship a little, each time bumping her on the sand with a shock.  The\r\npeople on deck held frantically to the wreckage around them.\r\n\r\nThen the bearded man, stripping to his waist and cutting off his trousers\r\nabove the knee, fastened an end of the rope round his waist.  The sailors\r\nstood ready one behind the other to pay it out.  As a great wave rolled\r\nunder the ship, he threw himself into the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the coastguard had fixed Board of Trade rocket-apparatus,\r\nand in a few seconds the prolonged roar of a rocket was heard.  It flew\r\nstraight towards the ship, rising at a high angle so as to fall beyond\r\nit.  But the force of the wind took it up as it rose, and the gale\r\nincreased so that it rose nearly vertically; and in this position the\r\nwind threw it south of its objective, and short of it.  Another rocket\r\nwas got ready at once, and blue lights were burned so that the course of\r\nthe venturous swimmer might be noted.  He swam strongly; but the great\r\nweight of the rope behind kept pulling him back, and the southern trend\r\nof the tide current and the force of the wind kept dragging him from the\r\npier.  Within the bar the waves were much less than without; but they\r\nwere still so unruly that no boat in the harbour--which was not a\r\nlifeboat station--could venture out.  Indeed, in the teeth of the storm\r\nit would have been a physical impossibility to have driven one seaward.\r\n\r\nAs the gathered crowd saw Stephen approach they made way for her.  She\r\nhad left her horse with the groom, and despite the drenching spray fought\r\na way against the wind out on the pier.  As in the glare of the blue\r\nlight, which brought many things into harsh unnatural perspective, she\r\ncaught sight of the set face of the swimmer rising and falling with the\r\nwaves, her heart leaped.  This was indeed a man! a brave man; and all the\r\nwoman in her went out to him.  For him, and to aid him and his work, she\r\nwould have given everything, done anything; and in her heart, which beat\r\nin an ecstasy of anxiety, she prayed with that desperate conviction of\r\nhope which comes in such moments of exaltation.\r\n\r\nBut it soon became apparent that no landing could be effected.  The force\r\nof the current and the wind were taking the man too far southward for him\r\never to win a way back.  Then one of coastguards took the lead-topped\r\ncane which they use for throwing practice, and, after carefully coiling\r\nthe line attached it so that it would run free, managed with a desperate\r\neffort to fling it far out.  The swimmer, to whom it fell close, fought\r\ntowards it frantically; and as the cord began to run through the water,\r\nmanaged to grasp it.  A wild cheer rose from the shore and the ship.  A\r\nstout line was fastened to the shore end of the cord, and the swimmer\r\ndrew it out to him.  He bent it on the rope which trailed behind him;\r\nthen, seeing that he was himself a drag on it, with the knife which he\r\ndrew from the sheath at the back of his waist, he cut himself free.  One\r\nof the coastguards on the pier, helped by a host of willing hands, began\r\ndrawing the end of the rope on shore.  The swimmer still held the line\r\nthrown to him, and several men on the pier began to draw on it.  Unhappily\r\nthe thin cord broke under the strain, and within a few seconds the\r\nswimmer had drifted out of possible help.  Seeing that only wild rocks\r\nlay south of the sea-wall, and that on them seas beat furiously, he\r\nturned and made out for sea.  In the light beyond the glare he could see\r\nvaguely the shore bending away to the west in a deep curve of unbroken\r\nwhite leaping foam.  There was no hope of landing there.  To the south\r\nwas the headland, perhaps two miles away as the crow flies.  Here was the\r\nonly chance for him.  If he could round the headland, he might find\r\nshelter beyond; or somewhere along the farther shore some opening might\r\npresent itself.  Whilst the light from the blue fires still reached him\r\nhe turned and made for the headland.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime on ship and on shore men worked desperately.  Before long\r\nthe end of the hawser was carried round on the high cliff, and pulled as\r\ntaut as the force at hand could manage, and made fast.  Soon endless\r\nropes were bringing in passengers and crew as fast as place could be\r\nfound for them.  It became simply a race for time.  If the fire, working\r\nagainst the wind, did not reach the hawser, and if the ship lasted the\r\nfurious bumping on the sandbank, which threatened to shake her to pieces\r\neach moment, all on board might yet be saved.\r\n\r\nStephen's concern was now for the swimmer alone.  Such a gallant soul\r\nshould not perish without help, if help could be on this side of heaven.\r\nShe asked the harbour-master, an old fisherman who knew every inch of the\r\ncoast for miles, if anything could be done.  He shook his head sadly as\r\nhe answered:\r\n\r\n'I fear no, my lady.  The lifeboat from Granport is up north, no boat\r\nfrom here could get outside the harbour.  There's never a spot in the bay\r\nwhere he could land, even in a less troubled sea than this.  Wi' the wind\r\nashore, there's no hope for ship or man here that cannot round the point.\r\nAnd a stranger is no like to do that.'\r\n\r\n'Why not?' she asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\n'Because, my lady, there's a wheen o' sunken rocks beyond the Head.  No\r\none that didn't know would ever think to keep out beyond them, for the\r\ncliff itself goes down sheer.  He's a gallant soul yon; an' it's a sore\r\npity he's goin' to his death.  But it must be!  God can save him if He\r\nwishes; but I fear none other!'\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke rose to Stephen's mind a memory of an old churchyard\r\nwith great trees and the scent of many flowers, and a child's voice that\r\nsounded harsh through the monotonous hum of bees:\r\n\r\n'To be God, and able to do things!'\r\n\r\nOh; to be God, if but an hour; and able to do things!  To do anything to\r\nhelp a brave man!  A wild prayer surged up in the girl's heart:\r\n\r\n'Oh! God, give me this man's life!  Give it to me to atone for the other\r\nI destroyed!  Let me but help him, and do with me as Thou wilt!'\r\n\r\nThe passion of her prayer seemed to help her, and her brain cleared.\r\nSurely something could be done!  She would do what she could; but first\r\nshe must understand the situation.  She turned again to the old harbour-\r\nmaster:\r\n\r\n'How long would it take him to reach the headland, if he can swim so\r\nfar?'  The answer came with a settled conviction bearing hope with it:\r\n\r\n'The wind and tide are wi' him, an' he's a strong swimmer.  Perhaps half\r\nan hour will take him there.  He's all right in himself.  He can swim it,\r\nsure.  But alack! it's when he gets there his trouble will be, when none\r\ncan warn him.  Look how the waves are lashing the cliff; and mark the\r\nwhite water beyond!  What voice can sound to him out in those deeps?  How\r\ncould he see if even one were there to warn?'\r\n\r\nHere was a hope at any rate.  Light and sound were the factors of safety.\r\nSome good might be effected if she could get a trumpet; and there were\r\ntrumpets in the rocket-cart.  Light could be had--must be had if all the\r\nfences round the headland had to be gathered for a bonfire!  There was\r\nnot a moment to be lost.  She ran to the rocket-cart, and got a trumpet\r\nfrom the man in charge.  Then she ran to where she had left her horse.\r\nShe had plenty of escort, for by this time many gentlemen had arrived on\r\nhorseback from outlying distances, and all offered their services.  She\r\nthanked them and said:\r\n\r\n'You may be useful here.  When all these are ashore send on the rocket-\r\ncart, and come yourselves to the headland as quick as you can.  Tell the\r\ncoastguards that all those saved are to be taken to the castle.  In the\r\nrocket-cart bring pitch and tar and oil, and anything that will flame.\r\nStay!' she cried to the chief boatman.  'Give me some blue lights!'  His\r\nanswer chilled her:\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry, my lady, but they are all used.  There are the last of them\r\nburning now.  We have burned them ever since that man began to swim\r\nashore.'\r\n\r\n'Then hurry on the rocket-cart!' she said as she sprang to the saddle,\r\nand swept out on the rough track that ran by the cliffs, following in\r\nbold curves the windings of the shore.  The white Arab seemed to know\r\nthat his speed was making for life.  As he swept along, far outdistancing\r\nthe groom, Stephen's heart went out in silent words which seemed to keep\r\ntime to the gallop:\r\n\r\n'Oh, to be God, and be able to do things!  Give me this man's life, oh,\r\nGod!  Give me this man's life, to atone for that noble one which I\r\ndestroyed!'\r\n\r\nFaster and faster, over rough road, cattle track, and grassy sward; over\r\nrising and falling ground; now and again so close to the edge of the high\r\ncliff that the spume swept up the gulleys in the rocks like a snowstorm,\r\nthe white Arab swept round the curve of the bay, and came out on the high\r\nheadland where stood the fisher's house.  On the very brink of the cliff\r\nall the fisher folk, men, women and children, stood looking at the far-\r\noff burning ship, from which the flames rose in leaping columns.\r\n\r\nSo intent were all on the cliff that they did not notice her coming; as\r\nthe roar of the wind came from them to her, they could not hear her voice\r\nwhen she spoke from a distance.  She had drawn quite close, having\r\ndismounted and hung her rein over the post of the garden paling, when one\r\nof the children saw her, and cried out:\r\n\r\n'The lady! the lady! an' she's all in red!'  The men were so intent on\r\nsomething that they did not seem to hear.  They were peering out to the\r\nnorth, and were arguing in dumb show as though on something regarding\r\nwhich they did not agree.  She drew closer, and touching the old\r\nfisherman on the shoulder, called out at his ear:\r\n\r\n'What is it?'  He answered without turning, keeping his eyes fixed:\r\n\r\n'_I_ say it's a man swimmin'.  Joe and Garge here say as it's only a\r\npiece o' wood or sea-wrack.  But I know I'm right.  That's a man\r\nswimmin', or my old eyes have lost their power!'  His words carried\r\nconviction; the seed of hope in her beating heart grew on the instant\r\ninto certainty.\r\n\r\n'It _is_ a man.  I saw him swim off towards here when he had taken the\r\nrope on shore.  Do not turn round.  Keep your eyes on him so that you may\r\nnot lose sight of him in the darkness!'  The old man chuckled.\r\n\r\n'This darkness!  Hee! hee!  There be no differ to me between light and\r\ndark.  But I'll watch him!  It's you, my lady!  I shan't turn round to do\r\nmy reverence as you tell me to watch.  But, poor soul, it'll not be for\r\nlong to watch.  The Skyres will have him, sure enow!'\r\n\r\n'We can warn him!' she said, 'when he comes close enough.  I have a\r\ntrumpet here!'  He shook his head sorrowfully:\r\n\r\n'Ah! my lady, what trumpet could sound against that storm an' from this\r\nheight?'  Stephen's heart sank.  But there was still hope.  If the\r\nswimmer's ears could not be reached, his eyes might.  Eagerly she looked\r\nback for the coming of the rocket-cart.  Far off across the deep bay she\r\ncould see its lamp sway as it passed over the rough ground; but alas! it\r\nwould never arrive in time.  With a note of despair in her voice she\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n'How long before he reaches the rocks?'  Still without turning the old\r\nman answered:\r\n\r\n'At the rate he's going he will be in the sweep of the current through\r\nthe rocks within three minutes.  If he's to be saved he must turn seaward\r\nere the stream grips him.'\r\n\r\n'Would there be time to build a bonfire?'\r\n\r\n'No, no! my lady.  The wood couldn't catch in the time!'\r\n\r\nFor an instant a black film of despair seemed to fall on her.  The\r\nsurging of the blood in her head made her dizzy, and once again the\r\nprayer of the old memory rang in her brain:\r\n\r\n'Oh to be God, and able to do things!'\r\n\r\nOn the instant an inspiration flashed through her.  She, too could do\r\nthings in a humble way.  She could do something at any rate.  If there\r\nwas no time to build a fire, there was a fire already built.\r\n\r\nThe house would burn!\r\n\r\nThe two feet deep of old thatch held down with nets and battened with\r\nwreck timber would flare like a beacon.  Forthwith she spoke:\r\n\r\n'Good people, this noble man who has saved a whole shipload of others\r\nmust not die without an effort.  There must be light so that he can see\r\nour warning to pass beyond the rocks!  The only light can be from the\r\nhouse.  I buy it of you.  It is mine; but I shall pay you for it and\r\nbuild you such another as you never thought of.  But it must be fired at\r\nonce.  You have one minute to clear out all you want.  In, quick and take\r\nall can.  Quick! quick! for God's sake!  It is for a brave man's life!'\r\n\r\nThe men and women without a word rushed into the house.  They too knew\r\nthe danger, and the only hope there was for a life.  The assurance of the\r\nCountess took the sting from the present loss.  Before the minute, which\r\nshe timed watch in hand, was over, all came forth bearing armloads of\r\ntheir lares and penates.  Then one of the younger men ran in again and\r\nout bearing a flaming stick from the fire.  Stephen nodded, he held it to\r\nthe northern edge of the thatch.  The straw caught in a flash and the\r\nflame ran up the slope and along the edge of the roof like a quick match.\r\nThe squeaking of many rats was heard and their brown bodies streamed over\r\nthe roof.  Before another minute had passed a great mass of flame towered\r\ninto the sky and shed a red light far out over the waste of sea.\r\n\r\nIt lit up the wilderness of white water where the sea churned savagely\r\namongst the sunken rocks; and it lit too the white face of a swimmer, now\r\nnearly spent, who rising and falling with each wave, drifted in the sea\r\nwhose current bore him on towards the fatal rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII--'TO BE GOD AND ABLE TO DO THINGS'\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the swimmer saw the light he looked up; even at the distance they\r\ncould see the lift of his face; but he did not seem to realise that there\r\nwas any intention in the lighting, or that it was created for his\r\nbenefit.  He was manifestly spent with his tremendous exertions, and with\r\nhis long heavy swim in the turbulent sea.  Stephen's heart went out to\r\nhim in a wave of infinite pity.  She tried to use the trumpet.  But\r\nsimple as it is, a trumpet needs skill or at least practice in its use;\r\nshe could only make an unintelligible sound, and not much even of that.\r\nOne of the young men said:\r\n\r\n'Let me try it, my lady!'  She handed him the trumpet and he in turn used\r\nwith a will.  But it was of no avail; even his strong lungs and lusty\r\nmanhood availed nothing in the teeth of that furious gale.  The roof and\r\nthe whole house was now well alight, and the flame roared and leapt.\r\nStephen began to make gestures bidding the swimmer, in case he might see\r\nher and understand, move round the rocks.  But he made no change in his\r\ndirection, and was fast approaching a point in the tide-race whence to\r\navoid the sunken rocks would be an impossibility.  The old whaler,\r\naccustomed to use all his wits in times of difficulty, said suddenly:\r\n\r\n'How can he understand when we're all between him and the light.  We are\r\nonly black shadows to him; all he can see are waving arms!'  His sons\r\ncaught his meaning and were already dashing towards the burning house.\r\nThey came back with piles of blazing wood and threw them down on the very\r\nedge of the cliff; brought more and piled them up, flinging heaps of\r\nstraw on the bonfire and pouring on oil and pitch till the flames rose\r\nhigh.  Stephen saw what was necessary and stood out of the way, but close\r\nto the old whaler, where the light fell on both of their faces as they\r\nlooked in the direction of the swimmer.  Stephen's red dress itself stood\r\nout like a flame.  The gale tearing up the front of the cliff had whirled\r\naway her hat; in the stress of the wind her hair was torn from its up-\r\npinning and flew wide, itself like leaping flame.\r\n\r\nHer gestures as she swept her right arm round, as though demonstrating\r\nthe outward curve of a circle, or raising the hand above her head\r\nmotioned with wide palm and spread fingers 'back! back!' seemed to have\r\nreached the swimmer's intelligence.  He half rose in the water and looked\r\nabout.  As if seeing something that he realised, he sank back again and\r\nbegan swim frantically out to sea.  A great throb of joy made Stephen\r\nalmost faint.  At last she had been able to do something to help this\r\ngallant man.  In half a minute his efforts seemed to tell in his race for\r\nlife.  He drew sufficiently far from dangerous current for there to be a\r\nhope that he might be saved if he could last out the stress to come.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen kept watch in silent eagerness; and in their presence\r\nStephen felt a comfort, though, like her, they could do nothing at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWhen the swimmer had passed sufficiently far out to be clear of the\r\nrocks, the fire began to lose its flame, though not its intensity.  It\r\nwould be fiery still for hours to come, and of great heat; but the flames\r\nceased to leap, and in the moderated light Stephen only saw the white\r\nface for one more instant ere it faded out of her ken, when, turning, the\r\nman looked towards the light and made a gesture which she did not\r\nunderstand: for he put for an instant both hands before his face.\r\n\r\nJust then there was a wild noise on the cliff.  The rocket-cart drawn by\r\nsixteen splendid horses, some of them hunters, came tearing up the slope,\r\nand with it many men on horseback afoot.  Many of the runners were the\r\ngentlemen who had given their horses for the good work.\r\n\r\nAs the coastguards jumped from the cart, and began to get out the rocket\r\nstand, the old whaler pointed out the direction where the swimmer's head\r\ncould still be seen.  Some of the sailors could see it too; though to\r\nStephen and the laymen it was invisible.  The chief boatman shook his\r\nhead:\r\n\r\n'No use throwing a line there!  Even if he got it we could never drag him\r\nalive through these rocks.  He would be pounded to death before twenty\r\nfathom!'  Stephen's heart grew cold as she listened.  Was this the end?\r\nThen with a bitter cry she wailed:\r\n\r\n'Oh! can nothing be done?  Can nothing be done?  Can no boat come from\r\nthe other side of the point?  Must such a brave man be lost!' and her\r\ntears began to flow.\r\n\r\nOne of the young men who had just arrived, a neighbouring squire, a\r\nproved wastrel but a fine horseman, who had already regarded Stephen at\r\nthe few occasions of their meeting with eyes of manifest admiration,\r\nspoke up:\r\n\r\n'Don't cry, Lady de Lannoy.  There's a chance for him yet.  I'll see what\r\nI can do.'\r\n\r\n'Bless you! oh! bless you!' she cried impulsively as she caught his hand.\r\nThen came the chill of doubt.  'But what can you do?' she added\r\ndespairingly.\r\n\r\n'Hector and I may be able to do something together.'  Turning to one of\r\nthe fishermen he asked:\r\n\r\n'Is there any way down to the water in the shelter of the point?'\r\n\r\n'Ay! ay! sir,' came the ready answer.  'There's the path as we get down\r\nby to our boats.'\r\n\r\n'Come on, then!' he said.  'Some of you chaps show us a light on the way\r\ndown.  If Hector can manage the scramble there's a chance.  You see,' he\r\nsaid, turning again to Stephen, 'Hector can swim like a fish.  When he\r\nwas a racer I trained him in the sea so that none of the touts could spy\r\nout his form.  Many's the swim we've had together; and in rough water\r\ntoo, though in none so wild as this!'\r\n\r\n'But it is a desperate chance for you!' said Stephen, woman-like drawing\r\nsomewhat back from a danger she had herself evoked.  The young man\r\nlaughed lightly:\r\n\r\n'What of that!  I may do one good thing before I die.  That fine fellow's\r\nlife is worth a hundred of my wasted one!  Here! some of you fellows help\r\nme with Hector.  We must take him from the cart and get a girth on him\r\ninstead of the saddle.  We shall want something to hold on to without\r\npulling his head down by using the bridle.'\r\n\r\nHe, followed by some others, ran to the rocket-cart where the horses\r\nstood panting, their steam rising in a white cloud in the glow of the\r\nburning house.  In an incredibly short time the horse was ready with only\r\nthe girth.  The young squire took him by the mane and he followed\r\neagerly; he had memories of his own.  As they passed close to Stephen the\r\nsquire said to one of his friends:\r\n\r\n'Hold him a minute, Jack!'  He ran over to Stephen and looked at her\r\nhard:\r\n\r\n'Good-bye!  Wish me luck; and give us light!'  Tears were in her eyes and\r\na flush on her cheek as she took his hand and clasped it hard:\r\n\r\n'Oh, you brave man!  God bless you!'  He stooped suddenly and impulsively\r\nkissed the back of her hand lightly and was gone.  For a fleeting moment\r\nshe was angry.  No man had kissed her hand before; but the thought of his\r\nliberty was swept away by another:\r\n\r\n'Little enough when he may be going to his death!'\r\n\r\nIt was a sight to see that man and horse, surrounded by an eager crowd of\r\nhelpers, scrambling down the rough zigzag, cut and worn in the very face\r\nof the cliff.  They stumbled, and slipped; pebbles and broken rock fell\r\naway under their feet.  Alone close to the bonfire stood Stephen,\r\nfollowing every movement with racing blood and beating heart.  The\r\nbonfire was glowing; a constant stream of men and women were dragging and\r\nhauling all sorts of material for its increase.  The head of the swimmer\r\ncould be seen, rising and falling amid the waves beyond the Skyres.\r\n\r\nWhen about twenty feet from the water-level the path jutted out to one\r\nside left of the little beach whereon the sea now broke fiercely.  This\r\nwas a place where men watched, and whence at times they fished with rods;\r\nthe broad rock overhung the water.  The fire above, though it threw\r\nshadows, made light enough for everything.  The squire held up his hand.\r\n\r\n'Stop!  We can take off this rock, if the water is deep enough.  How much\r\nis it?'\r\n\r\n'Ten fathoms sheer.'\r\n\r\n'Good!'  He motioned to them all to keep back.  Then threw off all his\r\nclothes except shirt and trousers.  For an instant he patted Hector and\r\nthen sprang upon his back.  Holding him by the mane he urged him forward\r\nwith a cry.  The noble animal did not hesitate an instant.  He knew that\r\ngrasp of the mane; that cry; that dig of the spurless heels.  He sprang\r\nforward with wide dilated nostrils, and from the edge of the jutting rock\r\njumped far out into the sea.  Man and horse disappeared for a few\r\nseconds, but rose safely.  The man slid from the horse's back; and,\r\nholding by the girth with one hand, swam beside him out to sea in the\r\ndirection the swimmer must come on rounding the sunken rocks.\r\n\r\nA wild cheer broke from all on the cliff above and those already\r\nscrambling back up the zigzag.  Stephen kept encouraging the men to bring\r\nfuel to the bonfire:\r\n\r\n'Bring everything you can find; the carts, the palings, the roofs, the\r\ncorn, the dried fish; anything and everything that will burn.  We must\r\nhave light; plenty of light!  Two brave men's lives are at stake now!'\r\n\r\nThe whole place was a scene of activity.  Stephen stood on the edge of\r\nthe cliff with the old whaler and the chief boatman and some of the\r\nwomen.  The rest of the coastguards were by orders of their chief rigging\r\nup a whip which they thought might be necessary to hoist the men up from\r\nthe water, if they could ever get close enough.  One of the young men who\r\nhad ridden with the rocket-cart kept tight hold of Hector's bridle; he\r\nknew it would be wanted if the horse ever had a chance of landing.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nWhen Harold turned away from the dazzling blue lights on the pier, and\r\nsaw the far white line of the cliffs beyond the bay, his heart sank\r\nwithin him.  Even his great strength and hardihood, won by work and\r\nprivation in the far North-West, had been already taxed in the many days\r\nof the battling with the gale when all on board who could lend a hand\r\nwere taken into service.  Again by the frantic struggle of the last hour\r\nor two, when the ship ran shoreward at the utmost of her speed in the\r\nlast hope of beaching in time to save life.  Finally in that grim\r\nstruggle to draw the life-line shoreward.  The cold and then the great\r\nheat, and on top of it the chill of the long swim, seemed to have struck\r\nat him.  Alone on the dark sea, for soon the current and his own\r\nexertions were taking him away from the rocks, the light of the burning\r\nship was ceasing to be effective.  It was just enough to hinder his\r\nvision; looking from the patch of light which bathed the light and him he\r\ncould just see far off the white water which marked the cliff fronts, and\r\non the edge of his horizon the grim moving white wall where the waves\r\nbroke on the headland.\r\n\r\nOn and on he toiled.  His limbs were becoming more cramped with the cold\r\nand the terrible strain of swimming in such waves.  But still the brave\r\nheart bore him up; and resolutely, sternly he forced himself afresh to\r\nthe effort before him.  He reasoned that where there was such a headland\r\nstanding out so stark into the sea there ought to be some shelter in its\r\nlee.  If he could pass it he might find calmer water and even a landing-\r\nplace beyond.\r\n\r\nHere at least was hope.  He would try to round the point at any rate.  Now\r\nhe drew so close that the great rocks seemed to tower vast above him.  He\r\nwas not yet close enough to feel as though lapped in their shadow; but\r\neven the overcast sky seemed full of light above the line of the cliff.\r\nThere was a strange roaring, rushing sound around him.  He thought that\r\nit was not merely the waves dashing on the rocks, but that partly it came\r\nfrom his own ears; that his ebbing strength was feeling the frantic\r\nstruggle which he was making.  The end was coming, he thought; but still\r\nhe kept valiantly on, set and silent, as is the way with brave men.\r\n\r\nSuddenly from the top of the cliff a bright light flashed.  He looked at\r\nit sideways as he fought his way on, and saw the light rise and fall and\r\nflicker as the flames leaped.  High over him he saw fantastic figures\r\nwhich seemed to dance on the edge of the high cliff.  They had evidently\r\nnoticed him, and were making signals of some sort; but what the motions\r\nwere he could not see or understand, for they were but dark silhouettes,\r\nedged with light, against the background of fire.  The only thing he\r\ncould think was that they meant to encourage him, and so he urged himself\r\nto further effort.  It might be that help was at hand!\r\n\r\nSeveral times as he turned his head sideways he saw the figures and the\r\nlight, but not so clearly; it was as though the light was lessening in\r\npower.  When again he looked he saw a new fire leap out on the edge of\r\nthe cliff, and some figures to the right of it.  They were signalling in\r\nsome way.  So, pausing in his swimming, he rose a little from the water\r\nand looked at them.\r\n\r\nA thrill shot through him, and a paralysing thought that he must have\r\ngone mad.  With his wet hand he cleared his eyes, though the touching\r\nthem pained him terribly, and for an instant saw clearly:\r\n\r\nThere on the edge of the cliff, standing beside some men and waving her\r\narms in a wild sweep as though motioning frantically 'Keep out! keep\r\nout!' was a woman.  Instinctively he glanced to his left and saw a white\r\nwaste of leaping water, through which sharp rocks rose like monstrous\r\nteeth.  On the instant he saw the danger, and made out seaward, swimming\r\nfrantically to clear the dangerous spot before the current would sweep\r\nhim upon the rocks.\r\n\r\nBut the woman!  As one remembers the last sight when the lightning has\r\nbanished sight, so that vision seemed burned into his brain.  A woman\r\nwith a scarlet riding-habit and masses of long red hair blowing in the\r\ngale like leaping flame!  Could there be two such persons in the world?\r\nNo! no!  It was a vision!  A vision of the woman he loved, come to save\r\nhim in the direst moment of great peril!\r\n\r\nHis heart beat with new hope; only the blackness of the stormy sea was\r\nbefore him as he strove frantically on.\r\n\r\nPresently when he felt the current slacken, for he had been swimming\r\nacross it and could feel its power, he turned and looked back.  As he did\r\nso he murmured aloud:\r\n\r\n'A dream!  A vision!  She came to warn me!'  For as he looked all had\r\ndisappeared.  Cliff and coastline, dark rocks and leaping seas, blazing\r\nfire, and the warning vision of the woman he loved.\r\n\r\nAgain he looked where the waste of sea churning amongst the sunken rocks\r\nhad been.  He could hear the roaring of waters, the thunder of great\r\nwaves beating on the iron-bound coast; but nothing could he see.  He was\r\nalone on the wild sea; in the dark.\r\n\r\nThen truly the swift shadow of despair fell upon him.\r\n\r\n'Blind  Blind!' he moaned, and for the moment, stricken with despair,\r\nsank into the trough of the waves.  But the instinctive desire for life\r\nrecalled him.  Once more he fought his way up to the surface, and swam\r\nblindly, desperately on.  Seeing nothing, he did not know which way he\r\nwas going.  He might have heard better had his eyes been able to help his\r\nears; but in the sudden strange darkness all the senses were astray.  In\r\nthe agony of his mind he could not even feel the pain of his burnt face;\r\nthe torture of his eyes had passed.  But with the instinct of a strong\r\nman he kept on swimming blindly, desperately.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if ages of untold agony had gone by, when he heard a voice\r\nseemingly beside him:\r\n\r\n'Lay hold here!  Catch the girth!'  The voice came muffled by wind and\r\nwave.  His strength was now nearly at its last.\r\n\r\nThe shock of his blindness and the agony of the moments that had passed\r\nhad finished his exhaustion.  But a little longer and he must have sunk\r\ninto his rest.  But the voice and the help it promised rallied him for a\r\nmoment.  He had hardly strength to speak, but he managed to gasp out:\r\n\r\n'Where? where?  Help me!  I am blind!'  A hand took his and guided it to\r\na tightened girth.  Instinctively his fingers closed round it, and he\r\nhung on grimly.  His senses were going fast.  He felt as if it was all a\r\nstrange dream.  A voice here in the sea!  A girth!  A horse; he could\r\nhear its hard breathing.\r\n\r\nThe voice came again.\r\n\r\n'Steady!  Hold on!  My God! he's fainted!  I must tie him on!'  He heard\r\na tearing sound, and something was wound round his wrists.  Then his\r\nnerveless fingers relaxed their hold; and all passed into oblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII--THE QUEEN'S ROOM\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Stephen all that now happened seemed like a dream.  She saw Hector and\r\nhis gallant young master forge across the smoother water of the current\r\nwhose boisterous stream had been somewhat stilled in the churning amongst\r\nthe rocks, and then go north in the direction of the swimmer who, strange\r\nto say, was drifting in again towards the sunken rocks.  Then she saw the\r\nswimmer's head sink under the water; and her heart grew cold.  Was this\r\nto be the end!  Was such a brave man to be lost after such gallant effort\r\nas he had made, and just at the moment when help was at hand!\r\n\r\nThe few seconds seemed ages.  Instinctively she shut her eyes and prayed\r\nagain.  'Oh! God.  Give me this man's life that I may atone!'\r\n\r\nGod seemed to have heard her prayer.  Nay, more!  He had mercifully\r\nallowed her to be the means of averting great danger.  She would never,\r\ncould never, forget the look on the man's face when he saw, by the flame\r\nthat she had kindled, ahead of him the danger from the sunken rocks.  She\r\nhad exulted at the thought.  And now . . .\r\n\r\nShe was recalled by a wild cheer beside her.  Opening her eyes she saw\r\nthat the man's head had risen again from the water.  He was swimming\r\nfuriously, this time seaward.  But close at hand were the heads of the\r\nswimming horse and man . . . She saw the young squire seize the man . . .\r\n\r\nAnd then the rush of her tears blinded her.  When she could see again the\r\nhorse had turned and was making back again to the shelter of the point.\r\nThe squire had his arm stretched across the horse's back; he was holding\r\nup the sailor's head, which seemed to roll helplessly with every motion\r\nof the cumbering sea.\r\n\r\nFor a little she thought he was dead, but the voice of the old whaler\r\nreassured her:\r\n\r\n'He was just in time!  The poor chap was done!'  And so with beating\r\nheart and eyes that did not flinch now she watched the slow progress to\r\nthe shelter of the point.  The coastguards and fishermen had made up\r\ntheir minds where the landing could be made, and were ready; on the rocky\r\nshelf, whence Hector had at jumped, they stood by with lines.  When the\r\nsquire had steered and encouraged the horse, whose snorting could be\r\nheard from the sheltered water, till he was just below the rocks, they\r\nlowered a noosed rope.  This he fastened round the senseless man below\r\nhis shoulders.  One strong, careful pull, and he was safe on land; and\r\nsoon was being borne up the steep zigzag on the shoulders of the willing\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime other ropes were passed down to the squire.  One he\r\nplaced round his own waist; two others he fastened one on each side of\r\nthe horse's girth.  Then his friend lowered the bridle, and he managed to\r\nput it on the horse and attached a rope to it.  The fishermen took the\r\nlines, and, paying out as they went so as to leave plenty of slack line,\r\ngot on the rocks just above the little beach whereon, sheltered though it\r\nwas, the seas broke heavily.  There they waited, ready to pull the horse\r\nthrough the surf when he should have come close enough.\r\n\r\nStephen did not see the rescue of the horse; for just then a tall grave\r\nman spoke to her:\r\n\r\n'Pardon me, Lady de Lannoy, but is the man to be brought up to the\r\nCastle?  I am told you have given orders that all the rescued shall be\r\ntaken there.'  She answered unhesitatingly:\r\n\r\n'Certainly!  I gave orders before coming out that preparation was to be\r\nmade for them.'\r\n\r\n'I am Mr. Hilton.  I have just come down to do lacum tenens for Dr.\r\nWinter at Lannoch Port.  I rode over on hearing there was a wreck, and\r\ncame here with the rocket-cart.  I shall take charge of the man and bring\r\nhim up.  He will doubtless want some special care.'\r\n\r\n'If you will be so good!' she answered, feeling a diffidence which was\r\nnew to her.  At that moment the crowd carrying the senseless man began to\r\nappear over the cliff, coming up the zig-zag.  The Doctor hurried towards\r\nhim; she followed at a little distance, fearing lest she should hamper\r\nhim.  Under his orders they laid the patient on the weather side of the\r\nbonfire so that the smoke would not reach him.  The Doctor knelt by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAn instant after he looked up and said:\r\n\r\n'He is alive; his heart is beating, though faintly.  He had better be\r\ntaken away at once.  There is no means here of shelter.'\r\n\r\n'Bring him in the rocket-cart; it is the only conveyance here,' cried\r\nStephen.  'And bring Mr. Hepburn too.  He also will need some care after\r\nhis gallant service.  I shall ride on and advise my household of your\r\ncoming.  And you good people come all to the Castle.  You are to be my\r\nguests if you will so honour me.  No!  No!  Really I should prefer to\r\nride alone!'\r\n\r\nShe said this impulsively, seeing that several of the gentlemen were\r\nrunning for their horses to accompany her.  'I shall not wait to thank\r\nthat valiant young gentleman.  I shall see him at Lannoy.'\r\n\r\nAs she was speaking she had taken the bridle of her horse.  One of the\r\nyoung men stooped and held his hand; she bowed, put her foot in it and\r\nsprang to the saddle.  In an instant she was flying across country at\r\nfull speed, in the dark.  A wild mood was on her, reaction from the\r\nprolonged agony of apprehension.  There was little which she would not\r\nhave done just then.\r\n\r\nThe gale whistled round her and now and again she shouted with pure joy.\r\nIt seemed as if God Himself had answered her prayer and given her the\r\nreturning life!\r\n\r\nBy the time she had reached the Castle the wild ride had done its\r\nsoothing work.  She was calm again, comparatively; her wits and feelings\r\nwere her own.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty to keep her occupied, mind and body.  The train of\r\npersons saved from the wreck were arriving in all sorts of vehicles, and\r\nas clothes had to be found for them as well as food and shelter there was\r\nno end to the exertions necessary.  She felt as though the world were not\r\nwide enough for the welcome she wished to extend.  Its exercise was a\r\nsort of reward of her exertions; a thank-offering for the response to her\r\nprayer.  She moved amongst her guests, forgetful of herself; of her\r\nstrange attire; of the state of dishevelment and grime in which she was,\r\nthe result of the storm, her long ride over rough ground with its share\r\nof marshes and pools, and the smoke from the bonfire and the blazing\r\nhouse.  The strangers wondered at first, till they came to understand\r\nthat she was the Lady Bountiful who had stretched her helpful hands to\r\nthem.  Those who could, made themselves useful with the new batches of\r\narrivals.  The whole Castle was lit from cellar to tower.  The kitchens\r\nwere making lordly provision, the servants were carrying piles of clothes\r\nof all sorts, and helping to fit those who came still wet from their\r\npassage through or over the heavy sea.\r\n\r\nIn the general disposition of chambers Stephen ordered to be set apart\r\nfor the rescued swimmer the Royal Chamber where Queen Elizabeth had lain;\r\nand for Mr. Hepburn that which had been occupied by the Second George.\r\nShe had a sort of idea that the stranger was God's guest who was coming\r\nto her house; and that nothing could be too good for him.  As she waited\r\nfor his coming, even though she swept to and fro in her ministrations to\r\nothers, she felt as though she trod on air.  Some great weight seemed to\r\nhave been removed from her.  Her soul was free again!\r\n\r\nAt last the rocket-cart arrived, and with it many horsemen and such men\r\nand women as could run across country with equal speed to the horses\r\nlabouring by the longer road.\r\n\r\nThe rescued man was still senseless, but that alone did not seem to cause\r\nanxiety to the Doctor, who hurried him at once into the prepared room.\r\nWhen, assisted by some of the other men, he had undressed him, rubbed him\r\ndown and put him to bed, and had seen some of the others who had been\r\nrescued from the wreck, he sought out Lady de Lannoy.  He told her that\r\nhis anxiety was for the man's sight; an announcement which blanched his\r\nhearer's cheeks.  She had so made up her mind as to his perfect safety\r\nthat the knowledge of any kind of ill came like a cruel shock.  She\r\nquestioned Mr. Hilton closely; so closely that he thought it well to tell\r\nher at once all that he surmised and feared:\r\n\r\n'That fine young fellow who swam out with his horse to him, tells me that\r\nwhen he neared him he cried out that he was blind.  I have made some\r\ninquiries from those on the ship, and they tell me that he was a\r\npassenger, named Robinson.  Not only was he not blind then, but he was\r\nthe strongest and most alert man on the ship.  If it be blindness it must\r\nhave come on during that long swim.  It may be that before leaving the\r\nship he received some special injury--indeed he has several cuts and\r\nburns and bruises--and that the irritation of the sea-water increased it.\r\nI can do nothing till he wakes.  At present he is in such a state that\r\nnothing can be done for him.  Later I shall if necessary give him a\r\nhypodermic to ensure sleep.  In the morning when I come again I shall\r\nexamine him fully.'\r\n\r\n'But you are not going away to-night!' said Stephen in dismay.  'Can't\r\nyou manage to stay here?  Indeed you must!  Look at all these people,\r\nsome of whom may need special attention or perhaps treatment.  We do not\r\nknow yet if any may be injured.'  He answered at once:\r\n\r\n'Of course I shall stay if you wish it.  But there are two other doctors\r\nhere already.  I must go over to my own place to get some necessary\r\ninstruments for the examination of this special patient.  But that I can\r\ndo in the early morning.'\r\n\r\n'Can I not send for what you want; the whole household are at your\r\nservice.  All that can be done for that gallant man must be done.  You\r\ncan send to London for special help if you wish.  If that man is blind,\r\nor in danger of blindness, we must have the best oculist in the world for\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\n'All shall be done that is possible,' said he earnestly.  'But till I\r\nexamine him in the morning we can do nothing.  I am myself an oculist;\r\nthat is my department in St. Stephen's Hospital.  I have an idea of what\r\nis wrong, but I cannot diagnose exactly until I can use the\r\nophthalmoscope.'  His words gave Stephen confidence.  Laying her hand on\r\nhis arm unconsciously in the extremity of pity she said earnestly:\r\n\r\n'Oh, do what you can for him.  He must be a noble creature; and all that\r\nis possible must be done.  I shall never rest happily if through any\r\nfailing on my part he suffers as you fear.'\r\n\r\n'I shall do all I can,' he said with equal earnestness, touched with her\r\neager pity.  'And I shall not trust myself alone, if any other can be of\r\nservice.  Depend upon it, Lady de Lannoy, all shall be as you wish.'\r\n\r\nThere was little sleep in the Castle that night till late.  Mr. Hilton\r\nslept on a sofa in the Queen's Room after he had administered a narcotic\r\nto his patient.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the eastern sky began to quicken, he rode, as he had arranged\r\nduring the evening, to Dr. Winter's house at Lannoch Port where he was\r\nstaying.  After selecting such instruments and drugs as he required, he\r\ncame back in the dogcart.\r\n\r\nIt was still early morning when he regained the Castle.  He found Lady de\r\nLannoy up and looking anxiously for him.  Her concern was somewhat abated\r\nwhen he was able to tell her that his patient still slept.\r\n\r\nIt was a painful scene for Mr. Hilton when his patient woke.  Fortunately\r\nsome of the after-effects of the narcotic remained, for his despair at\r\nrealising that he was blind was terrible.  It was not that he was\r\nviolent; to be so under his present circumstances would have been foreign\r\nto Harold's nature.  But there was a despair which was infinitely more\r\nsad to witness than passion.  He simply moaned to himself:\r\n\r\n'Blind!  Blind!' and again in every phase of horrified amazement, as\r\nthough he could not realise the truth: 'Blind!  Blind!'  The Doctor laid\r\nhis hand on his breast and said very gently:\r\n\r\n'My poor fellow, it is a dreadful thing to face, to think of.  But as yet\r\nI have not been able to come to any conclusion; unable even to examine\r\nyou.  I do not wish to encourage hopes that may be false, but there are\r\ncases when injury is not vital and perhaps only temporary.  In such case\r\nyour best chance, indeed your only chance, is to keep quiet.  You must\r\nnot even think if possible of anything that may excite you.  I am now\r\nabout to examine you with the ophthalmoscope.  You are a man; none of us\r\nwho saw your splendid feat last night can doubt your pluck.  Now I want\r\nyou to use some of it to help us both.  You, for your recovery, if such\r\nis possible; me, to help me in my work.  I have asked some of your late\r\ncompanions who tell me that on shipboard you were not only well and of\r\ngood sight, but that you were remarkable even amongst strong men.\r\nWhatever it is you suffer from must have come on quickly.  Tell me all\r\nyou can remember of it.'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor listened attentively whilst Harold told all he could remember\r\nof his sufferings.  When he spoke of the return of old rheumatic pains\r\nhis hearer said involuntarily: 'Good!'  Harold paused; but went on at\r\nonce.  The Doctor recognised that he had rightly appraised his remark,\r\nand by it judged that he was a well-educated man.  Something in the\r\nmethod of speaking struck him, and he said, as nonchalantly as he could:\r\n\r\n'By the way, which was your University?'\r\n\r\n'Cambridge.  Trinity.'  He spoke without thinking, and the instant he had\r\ndone so stopped.  The sense of his blindness rushed back on him.  He\r\ncould not see; and his ears were not yet trained to take the place of his\r\neyes.  He must guard himself.  Thenceforward he was so cautious in his\r\nreplies that Mr. Hilton felt convinced there was some purpose in his\r\nreticence.  He therefore stopped asking questions, and began to examine\r\nhim.  He was unable to come to much result; his opinion was shown in his\r\nreport to Lady de Lannoy:\r\n\r\n'I am unable to say anything definite as yet.  The case is a most\r\ninteresting one; as a case and quite apart from the splendid fellow who\r\nis the subject of it.  I have hopes that within a few days I may be able\r\nto know more.  I need not trouble you with surgical terms; but later on\r\nif the diagnosis supports the supposition at present in my mind I shall\r\nbe able to speak more fully.  In the meantime I shall, with your\r\npermission, wait here so that I may watch him myself.'\r\n\r\n'Oh you are good.  Thank you!  Thank you!' said Stephen.  She had so\r\ntaken the man under her own care that she was grateful for any kindness\r\nshown to him.\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' said Mr. Hilton.  'Any man who behaved as that fellow did\r\nhas a claim on any of us who may help him.  No time of mine could be\r\nbetter spent.'\r\n\r\nWhen he went back to the patient's room he entered softly, for he thought\r\nhe might be asleep.  The room was, according to his instructions, quite\r\ndark, and as it was unfamiliar to him he felt his way cautiously.  Harold,\r\nhowever, heard the small noise he made and said quietly:\r\n\r\n'Who is there?'\r\n\r\n'It is I; Hilton.'\r\n\r\n'Are you alone?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Look round the room and see.  Then lock the door and come and talk to me\r\nif you will.  You will pity a poor blind fellow, I know.  The darkness\r\nhas come down upon me so quickly that I am not accustomed to it!'  There\r\nwas a break in his voice which moved the other.  He lit a candle, feeling\r\nthat the doing so would impress his patient, and went round the room; not\r\nwith catlike movement this time--he wanted the other to hear him.  When\r\nhe had turned the key in the lock, as sharply as he could, he came to the\r\nbedside and sat down.  Harold spoke again after a short pause:\r\n\r\n'Is that candle still lit?'\r\n\r\n'Yes!  Would you like it put out?'\r\n\r\n'If you don't mind!  Again I say pity me and pardon me.  But I want to\r\nask you something privately, between our two selves; and I will feel more\r\nof equality than if you were looking at me, whilst I cannot see you.'  Mr\r\nHilton blew out the candle.\r\n\r\n'There!  We are equal now.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you!'  A long pause; then he went on:\r\n\r\n'When a man becomes suddenly blind is there usually, or even\r\noccasionally, any sort of odd sight? . . . Does he see anything like a\r\ndream, a vision?'\r\n\r\n'Not that I know of.  I have never heard of such a case.  As a rule\r\npeople struck blind by lightning, which is the most common cause,\r\nsometimes remember with extraordinary accuracy the last thing they have\r\nseen.  Just as though it were photographed on the retina!'\r\n\r\n'Thank you!  Is such usually the recurrence of any old dream or anything\r\nthey have much thought of?'\r\n\r\n'Not that I know of.  It would be unusual!'  Harold waited a long time\r\nbefore he spoke again.  When he did so it was in a different voice; a\r\nconstrained voice.  The Doctor, accustomed to take enlightenment from\r\ntrivial details, noted it:\r\n\r\n'Now tell me, Mr. Hilton, something about what has happened.  Where am\r\nI?'\r\n\r\n'In Lannoy Castle.'\r\n\r\n'Where is it?'\r\n\r\n'In Angleshire!'\r\n\r\n'Who does it belong to?'\r\n\r\n'Lady de Lannoy.  The Countess de Lannoy; they tell me she is a Countess\r\nin her own right.'\r\n\r\n'It is very good of her to have me here.  Is she an old lady?'\r\n\r\n'No!  A young one.  Young and very beautiful.'  After a pause before his\r\nquery:\r\n\r\n'What's she like?  Describe her to me!'\r\n\r\n'She is young, a little over twenty.  Tall and of a very fine figure.  She\r\nhas eyes like black diamonds, and hair like a flame!'  For a long time\r\nHarold remained still.  Then he said:\r\n\r\n'Tell me all you know or have learned of this whole affair.  How was I\r\nrescued, and by whom?'  So the Doctor proceeded to give him every detail\r\nhe knew of.  When he was quite through, the other again lay still for a\r\nlong time.  The silence was broken by a gentle tap at the door.  The\r\nDoctor lit a candle.  He turned the key softly, so that no one would\r\nnotice that the door was locked.  Something was said in a low whisper.\r\nThen the door was gently closed, and the Doctor returning said:\r\n\r\n'Lady Lannoy wants, if it will not disturb you, to ask how you are.\r\nOrdinarily I should not let anyone see you.  But she is not only your\r\nhostess, but, as I have just told you, it was her ride to the headland,\r\nwhere she burned the house to give you light, which was the beginning of\r\nyour rescue.  Still if you think it better not . . . !'\r\n\r\n'I hardly like anybody to see me like this!' said Harold, feebly seeking\r\nan excuse.\r\n\r\n'My dear man,' said the other, 'you may be easy in your mind, she won't\r\nsee much of you.  You are all bandages and beard.  She'll have to wait a\r\nwhile before she sees you.'\r\n\r\n'Didn't she see me last night?'\r\n\r\n'Not she!  Whilst we were trying to restore you she was rushing back to\r\nthe Castle to see that all was ready for you, and for the others from the\r\nwreck.'  This vaguely soothed Harold.\r\n\r\nIf his surmise was correct, and if she had not seen him then, it was well\r\nthat he was bandaged now.  He felt that it would not do to refuse to let\r\nher see him; it might look suspicious.  So after pausing a short while he\r\nsaid in a low voice:\r\n\r\n'I suppose she had better come now.  We must not keep her waiting!'  When\r\nthe Doctor brought her to his bedside Stephen felt in a measure awed.  His\r\nbandaged face and head and his great beard, singed in patches, looked to\r\nher in the dim light rather awesome.  In a very gentle voice she said\r\nkind things to the sick man, who acknowledged them in a feeble whisper.\r\nThe Doctor, a keen observer, noticed the change in his voice, and\r\ndetermined to understand more.  Stephen spoke of his bravery, and of how\r\nit was due to him that all on the ship were saved; and as she spoke her\r\nemotion moved her so much that her sweet voice shook and quivered.  To\r\nthe ears of the man who had now only sound to guide him, it was music of\r\nthe sweetest he had ever heard.  Fearing lest his voice should betray\r\nhim, he whispered his own thanks feebly and in few words.\r\n\r\nWhen Stephen went away the Doctor went with her; it was more than an hour\r\nbefore he returned.  He found his patient in what he considered a state\r\nof suppressed excitement; for, though his thoughts were manifestly\r\ncollected and his words were calm, he was restless and excited in other\r\nways.  He had evidently been thinking of his own condition; for shortly\r\nafter the Doctor came in he said:\r\n\r\n'Are we alone?'\r\n\r\n'Quite!'\r\n\r\n'I want you to arrange that there shall not be any nurse with me.'\r\n\r\n'My dear sir!  Don't handicap me, and yourself, with such a restriction.\r\nIt is for your own good that you should have regular and constant\r\nattention.'\r\n\r\n'But I don't wish it.  Not for the present at all events.  I am not\r\naccustomed to a nurse, and shall not feel comfortable.  In a few days\r\nperhaps . . . '  The decided tone of his voice struck the other.  Keeping\r\nhis own thoughts and intentions in abeyance, even to himself, he answered\r\nheartily:\r\n\r\n'All right!  I shall not have any nurse, at present.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks!'  There was relief in the tone which seemed undue, and Mr.\r\nHilton again took mental note.  Presently he asked a question, but in\r\nsuch a tone that the Doctor pricked up his ears.  There was a\r\npremeditated self-suppression, a gravity of restraint, which implied some\r\nfalsity; some intention other than the words conveyed:\r\n\r\n'It must have been a job to carry me up those stairs.'  The Doctor was\r\ndoubting everything, but as the safest attitude he stuck to literal truth\r\nso far as his words conveyed it:\r\n\r\n'Yes.  You are no light weight!'  To himself he mused:\r\n\r\n'How did he know there were stairs?  He cannot know it; he was senseless!\r\nTherefore he must be guessing or inquiring!'  Harold went on:\r\n\r\n'I suppose the Castle is on high ground.  Can you see far from the\r\nwindows?  I suppose we are up a good height?'\r\n\r\n'From the windows you can see all round the promontory.  But we are not\r\nhigh up; that is, the room is not high from the ground, though the Castle\r\nis from the sea.'  Harold asked again, his voice vibrating in the note of\r\ngladness:\r\n\r\n'Are we on the ground floor then?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'And I suppose the gardens are below us?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'  The answer was given quickly, for a thought was floating through\r\nhim: Why did this strong brave man, suddenly stricken blind, wish to know\r\nwhether his windows were at a height?  He was not surprised when his\r\npatient reaching out a hand rested it on his arm and said in an imploring\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n'It should be moonlight; full moon two nights ago.  Won't you pull up the\r\nblind and describe to me all you see? . . . Tell me fully . . . Remember,\r\nI am blind!'\r\n\r\nThis somehow fixed the Doctor's thought:\r\n\r\n'Suicide!  But I must convey the inutility of such effort by inference,\r\nnot falsity.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly he began to describe the scene, from the very base of the\r\nwall, where below the balcony the great border was glorious with a mass\r\nof foliage plants, away to the distant sea, now bathed in the flood of\r\nmoonlight.  Harold asked question after question; the Doctor replying\r\naccurately till he felt that the patient was building up a concrete idea\r\nof his surroundings near and far.  Then he left him.  He stood for a long\r\ntime out in the passage thinking.  He said to himself as he moved away:\r\n\r\n'The poor fellow has some grim intention in his mind.  I must not let him\r\nknow that I suspect; but to-night I will watch without his knowing it!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV--WAITING\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hilton telegraphed at once countermanding, for the present, the nurse\r\nfor whom he had sent.\r\n\r\nThat night, when the household had all retired, he came quietly to his\r\npatient's room, and entering noiselessly, sat silent in a far corner.\r\nThere was no artificial right; the patient had to be kept in darkness.\r\nThere was, however, a bright moonlight; sufficient light stole in through\r\nthe edges of the blinds to allow him, when his eyes grew accustomed, to\r\nsee what might happen.\r\n\r\nHarold lay quite still till the house was quiet.  He had been thinking,\r\never since he had ascertained the identity of Stephen.  In his weakness\r\nand the paralysing despair of his blindness all his former grief and\r\napprehension had come bank upon him in a great wave; veritably the tide\r\nof circumstances seemed to run hard against him.  He had had no idea of\r\nforcing himself upon Stephen; and yet here he was a guest in her house,\r\nwithout her knowledge or his own.  She had saved his life by her energy\r\nand resource.  Fortunately she did not as yet know him; the bandages, and\r\nhis act in suppressing his voice, had so far protected him.  But such\r\ncould not last for long.  He could not see to protect himself, and take\r\nprecautions as need arose.  And he knew well that Stephen's nature would\r\nnot allow her to be satisfied without doing all that was possible to help\r\none who had under her eyes made a great effort on behalf of others, and\r\nto whom there was the added bond that his life was due to her.  In but a\r\nlittle time she must find out to whom she ministered.\r\n\r\nWhat then would happen?  Her kindness was such that when she realised the\r\nblindness of her old friend she might so pity him that out of the depths\r\nof her pity she would forgive.  She would take back all the past; and now\r\nthat she knew of his old love for her, would perhaps be willing to marry\r\nhim.  Back flooded the old memory of her independence and her theory of\r\nsexual equality.  If out of any selfish or mistaken idea she did not\r\nhesitate to ask a man to marry her, would it be likely that when the\r\nnobler and more heroic side of her nature spoke she would hesitate to a\r\nsimilar act in pursuance of her self-sacrifice?\r\n\r\nSo it might be that she would either find herself once again flouted, or\r\nelse married to a man she did not love.\r\n\r\nSuch a catastrophe should not happen, whatever the cost to him.  He\r\nwould, blind as he was, steal away in the night and take himself out of\r\nher life; this time for ever.  Better the ingratitude of an unknown man,\r\nthe saving of whose life was due to her, than the long dull routine of a\r\nspoiled life, which would otherwise be her unhappy lot.\r\n\r\nWhen once this idea had taken root in his mind he had taken such steps as\r\nhad been open to him without endangering the secrecy of his motive.\r\nThanks to his subtle questioning of the Doctor, he now knew that his room\r\nwas close to the ground, so that he would easily drop from the window and\r\nsteal away with out immediate danger of any restraining accident.  If he\r\ncould once get away he would be all right.  There was a large sum to his\r\ncredit in each of two London banks.  He would manage somehow to find his\r\nway to London; even if he had to walk and beg his way.\r\n\r\nHe felt that now in the silence of the night the time had come.  Quietly\r\nhe rose and felt his way to the door, now and again stumbling and\r\nknocking against unknown obstacles in the manner of the recently blind.\r\nAfter each such noise he paused and listened.  He felt as if the very\r\nwalls had ears.  When he reached the door he turned the key softly.  Then\r\nhe breathed more freely.  He felt that he was at last alone and free to\r\nmove without suspicion.\r\n\r\nThen began a great and arduous search; one that was infinitely difficult\r\nand exasperating; and full of pathos to the sympathetic man who watched\r\nhim in silence.  Mr. Hilton could not understand his movements as he felt\r\nhis way about the room, opening drawers and armoires, now and again\r\nstooping down and feeling along the floor.  He did not betray his\r\npresence, however, but moved noiselessly away as the other approached.  It\r\nwas a hideously real game of blindman's-buff, with perhaps a life as the\r\nforfeit.\r\n\r\nHarold went all over the room, and at last sat down on the edge of his\r\nbed with a hollow suppressed groan that was full of pain.  He had found\r\nhis clothes, but realised that they were now but rags.  He put on the\r\nclothes, and then for a long time sat quiet, rocking gently to and fro as\r\none in pain, a figure of infinite woe.  At last he roused himself.  His\r\nmind was made up; the time for action had come.  He groped his way\r\ntowards the window looking south.  The Doctor, who had taken off his\r\nshoes, followed him with catlike stealthiness.\r\n\r\nHe easily threw open the window, for it was already partly open for\r\nventilation.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hilton saw him sit on the rail of the balcony and begin to raise\r\nhis feet, getting ready to drop over, he rushed forward and seized him.\r\nHarold instinctively grappled with him; the habit of his Alaskan life\r\namidst continual danger made in such a case action swift as thought.  Mr.\r\nHilton, with the single desire to prevent him from killing himself, threw\r\nhimself backward and pulled Harold with him to the stone floor.\r\n\r\nHarold, as he held him in a grip of iron, thundered out, forgetful in the\r\nexcitement of the moment the hushed voice to which he had limited\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n'What do you want? who are you?'\r\n\r\n'H-s-s-sh!  I am Mr. Hilton.'  Harold relaxed the rigour of his grasp but\r\nstill held him firmly:\r\n\r\n'How did you come here?  I locked my door!'\r\n\r\n'I have been in the room a long time.  I suspected something, and came to\r\nwatch; to prevent your rash act.'\r\n\r\n'Rash act!  How?'\r\n\r\n'Why, man, if you didn't kill, you would at least cripple yourself.'\r\n\r\n'How can I cripple myself when the flower-bed is only a few feet below?'\r\n\r\n'There are other dangers for a man who--a man in your sad state.  And,\r\nbesides, have I no duty to prevent a suicide!'  Here a brilliant idea\r\nstruck Harold.  This man had evidently got some wrong impression; but it\r\nwould serve to shield his real purpose.  He would therefore encourage it.\r\nFor the moment, of course, his purpose to escape unnoticed was foiled;\r\nbut he would wait, and in due time seize another opportunity.  In a\r\nharder and more determined tone than he had yet used he said:\r\n\r\n'I don't see what right you have to interfere.  I shall kill myself if I\r\nlike.'\r\n\r\n'Not whilst you are in my care!'  This was spoken with a resolution equal\r\nto his own.  Then Mr. Hilton went on, more softly and with infinite\r\ncompassion: 'Moreover, I want to have a talk with you which may alter\r\nyour views.'  Harold interrupted, still playing the game of hiding his\r\nreal purpose:\r\n\r\n'I shall do as I wish; as I intend.'\r\n\r\n'You are injuring yourself even now by standing in the draught of that\r\nopen window.  Your eyes will feel it before long . . . Are you mad . . .\r\n?'\r\n\r\nHarold felt a prick like a pin in his neck; and turned to seize his\r\ncompanion.  He could not find him, and for a few moments stumbled through\r\nthe dark, raging . . .\r\n\r\nIt seemed a long time before he remembered anything.  He had a sense of\r\ntime lapsed; of dreamland thoughts and visions.  Then gradually\r\nrecollection came back.  He tried to move; but found it impossible.  His\r\narms and legs were extended wide and were tied; he could feel the cord\r\nhurting his wrists and ankles as he moved.  To him it was awful to be\r\nthus blind and helpless; and anger began to surge up.  He heard the voice\r\nof Mr. Hilton close by him speaking in a calm, grave, sympathetic tone:\r\n\r\n'My poor fellow, I hated to take such a step; but it was really necessary\r\nfor your own safety.  You are a man, and a brave one.  Won't you listen\r\nto me for a few minutes?  When you have heard what I have to say I shall\r\nrelease you.  In the meantime I apologise for the outrage, as I dare say\r\nyou consider it!'  Harold was reasonable; and he was now blind and\r\nhelpless.  Moreover, there was something in the Doctor's voice that\r\ncarried a sense of power with it.\r\n\r\n'Go on! I shall listen!'  He compelled himself to quietude.  The Doctor\r\nsaw, and realised that he was master of himself.  There were some snips\r\nof scissors, and he was free.\r\n\r\n'See! all I want is calm for a short time, and you have it.  May I go\r\non?'\r\n\r\n'Go on!' said Harold, not without respect.  The Doctor after a pause\r\nspoke:\r\n\r\n'My poor fellow, I want you to understand that I wish to help you, to do\r\nall in my power to restore to you that which you seem to have lost!  I\r\ncan sympathise with your desire to quit life altogether now that the best\r\npart of it, sight, seems gone.  I do not pretend to judge the actions of\r\nmy fellows; and if you determine to carry out your purpose I shall not be\r\nable to prevent you for ever.  I shall not try to.  But you certainly\r\nshall not do so till you know what I know!  I had wished to wait till I\r\ncould be a little more certain before I took you into confidence with\r\nregard to my guessing as to the future.  But your desire to destroy\r\nyourself forces my hand.  Now let me tell you that there is a possibility\r\nof the removal of the cause of your purpose.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' gasped Harold.  He was afraid to think outright and\r\nto the full what the other's words seemed to imply.\r\n\r\n'I mean,' said the other solemnly, 'that there is a possibility, more\r\nthan a possibility, that you may recover your sight!'  As he spoke there\r\nwas a little break in his voice.  He too was somewhat unnerved at the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nHarold lay still.  The whole universe seemed to sway, and then whirl\r\nround him in chaotic mass.  Through it at length he seemed to hear the\r\ncalm voice:\r\n\r\n'At first I could not be sure of my surmise, for when I used the\r\nophthalmoscope your suffering was too recent to disclose the cause I\r\nlooked for.  Now I am fairly sure of it.  What I have since heard from\r\nyou has convinced me; your having suffered from rheumatic fever, and the\r\nrecrudescence of the rheumatic pain after your terrible experience of the\r\nfire and that long chilling swim with so seemingly hopeless an end to it;\r\nthe symptoms which I have since noticed, though they have not been as\r\nenlightening to me as they might be.  Your disease, as I have diagnosed\r\nit, is an obscure one and not common.  I have not before been able to\r\nstudy a case.  All these things give me great hopes.'\r\n\r\n'Thank God!  Thank God!' the voice from the bed was now a whisper.\r\n\r\n'Thank God! say I too.  This that you suffer from is an acute form of\r\ninflammation of the optic nerve.  It may of course end badly; in\r\npermanent loss of sight.  But I hope--I believe, that in your case it\r\nwill not be so.  You are young, and you are immensely strong; not merely\r\nmuscularly, but in constitution.  I can see that you have been an\r\nathlete, and no mean one either.  All this will stand to you.  But it\r\nwill take time.  It will need all your own help; all the calm restraint\r\nof your body and your mind.  I am doing all that science knows; you must\r\ndo the rest!'  He waited, giving time to the other to realise his ideas.\r\nHarold lay still for a long time before he spoke:\r\n\r\n'Doctor.'  The voice was so strangely different that the other was more\r\nhopeful at once.  He had feared opposition, or conflict of some kind.  He\r\nanswered as cheerily as he could:\r\n\r\n'Yes!  I am listening.'\r\n\r\n'You are a good fellow; and I am grateful to you, both for what you have\r\ndone and what you have told me.  I cannot say how grateful just yet; hope\r\nunmans me at present.  But I think you deserve that I should tell you the\r\ntruth!'  The other nodded; he forgot that the speaker could not see.\r\n\r\n'I was not intending to commit suicide.  Such an idea didn't even enter\r\nmy head.  To me, suicide is the resource of a coward.  I have been in too\r\nmany tight places to ever fear that.'\r\n\r\n'Then in the name of goodness why were you trying to get out of that\r\nwindow?'\r\n\r\n'I wanted to escape; to get away!'\r\n\r\n'In your shirt and trousers; and they are not over much!  Without even\r\nslippers!'  A faint smile curled round the lips of the injured man.  Hope\r\nwas beginning to help already.\r\n\r\n'Even that way!'\r\n\r\n'But man alive! you were going to your death.  How could you expect to\r\nget away in such an outfit without being discovered?  When you were\r\nmissed the whole countryside would have been up, and even before the hue-\r\nand-cry the first person who saw you would have taken charge of you.'\r\n\r\n'I know!  I know!  I had thought of it all.  But I was willing to chance\r\nit.  I had my own reasons!'  He was silent a while.  The Doctor was\r\nsilent too.  Each man was thinking in his own way.  Presently the Doctor\r\nspoke:\r\n\r\n'Look here, old chap!  I don't want to pry into your secrets; but, won't\r\nyou let me help you?  I can hold my tongue.  I want to help you.  You\r\nhave earned that wish from any man, and woman too, who saw the burning\r\nship and what you did to save those on board.  There is nothing I would\r\nnot do for you.  Nothing!  I don't ask you to tell me all; only enough\r\nfor me to understand and help.  I can see that you have some overpowering\r\nwish to get away.  Some reason that I cannot fathom, certainly without a\r\nclue.  You may trust me, I assure you.  If you could look into my face,\r\nmy eyes, you would understand.  But--There! take my hand.  It may tell\r\nyou something!'\r\n\r\nHarold took the hand placed in his, and held it close.  He pressed his\r\nother hand over it also, as though the effect of the two hands would\r\nbring him double knowledge.  It was infinitely pathetic to see him trying\r\nto make his untrained fingers do the duty of his trained eyes.  But,\r\ntrained or not, his hands had their instinct.  Laying down gently the\r\nhand he held he said, turning his bandaged eyes in the direction of his\r\ncompanion:\r\n\r\n'I shall trust you!  Are we alone; absolutely alone?'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely!'\r\n\r\n'Have I your solemn promise that anything I say shall never go beyond\r\nyourself?'\r\n\r\n'I promise.  I can swear, if it will make your mind more easy in the\r\nmatter.'\r\n\r\n'What do you hold most sacred in the world?'  Harold had an odd thought;\r\nhis question was its result.\r\n\r\n'All told, I should think my profession!  Perhaps it doesn't seem to you\r\nmuch to swear by; but it is all my world!  But I have been brought up in\r\nhonour, and you may trust my promise--as much as anything I could swear.'\r\n\r\n'All right!  My reason for wanting to get away was because I knew Lady de\r\nLannoy!'\r\n\r\n'What!'  Then after a pause: 'I should have thought that was a reason for\r\nwanting to stay.  She seems not only one of the most beautiful, but the\r\nsweetest woman I ever met.'\r\n\r\n'She is all that!  And a thousand times more!'\r\n\r\n'Then why--Pardon me!'\r\n\r\n'I cannot tell you all; but you must take it that my need to get away is\r\nimperative.'  After pondering a while Mr. Hilton said suddenly:\r\n\r\n'I must ask your pardon again.  Are you sure there is no mistake.  Lady\r\nde Lannoy is not married; has not been.  She is Countess in her own\r\nright.  It is quite a romance.  She inherited from some old branch of\r\nmore than three hundred years ago.'  Again Harold smiled; he quite saw\r\nwhat the other meant.\r\n\r\nHe answered gravely\r\n\r\n'I understand.  But it does not alter my opinion; my purpose.  It is\r\nneedful--absolutely and imperatively needful that I get away without her\r\nrecognising me, or knowing who I am.'\r\n\r\n'She does not know you now.  She has not seen you yet.'\r\n\r\n'That is why I hoped to get away in time; before she should recognise me.\r\nIf I stay quiet and do all you wish, will you help me?'\r\n\r\n'I will!  And what then?'\r\n\r\n'When I am well, if it should be so, I shall steal away, this time\r\nclothed, and disappear out of her life without her knowing.  She may\r\nthink it ungrateful that one whom she has treated so well should behave\r\nso badly.  But that can't be helped.  It is the lesser evil of the two.'\r\n\r\n'And I must abet you?  All right!  I will do it; though you must forgive\r\nme if you should ever hear that I have abused you and said bad things of\r\nyou.  It will have to be all in the day's work if I am not ultimately to\r\ngive you away.  I must take steps at once to keep her from seeing you.  I\r\nshall have to invent some story; some new kind of dangerous disease,\r\nperhaps.  I shall stay here and nurse you myself!'  Harold spoke in\r\njoyful gratitude:\r\n\r\n'Oh, you _are_ good.  But can you spare the time?  How long will it all\r\ntake?'\r\n\r\n'Some weeks!  Perhaps!'  He paused as if thinking.  'Perhaps in a month's\r\ntime I shall unbandage your eyes.  You will then see; or . . . '\r\n\r\n'I understand!  I shall be patient!'\r\n\r\nIn the morning Mr. Hilton in reporting to Lady de Lannoy told her that he\r\nconsidered it would be necessary to keep his patient very quiet, both in\r\nmind and body.  In the course of the conversation he said:\r\n\r\n'Anything which might upset him must be studiously avoided.  He is not an\r\neasy patient to deal with; he doesn't like people to go near him.  I\r\nthink, therefore, it will be well if even you do not see him.  He seems\r\nto have an odd distrust of people, especially of women.  It may be that\r\nhe is fretful in his blindness, which is in itself so trying to a strong\r\nman.  But besides, the treatment is not calculated to have a very buoyant\r\neffect.  It is apt to make a man fretful to lie in the dark, and know\r\nthat he has to do so for indefinite weeks.  Pilocarpin, and salicylate of\r\nsoda, and mercury do not tend towards cheerfulness.  Nor do blisters on\r\nthe forehead add to the content of life!'\r\n\r\n'I quite understand,' said Stephen, 'and I will be careful not to go near\r\nhim till he is well.  Please God! it may bring him back his sight.  Thank\r\nyou a thousand times for your determination to stay with him.'\r\n\r\nSo it was that for more than two weeks Harold was kept all alone.  No one\r\nattended him but the Doctor.  He slept in the patient's room for the\r\nwhole of the first week, and never had him out of sight for more than a\r\nfew minutes at a time.  He was then able to leave him alone for longer\r\nperiods, and settled himself in the bedroom next to him.  Every hour or\r\ntwo he would visit him.  Occasionally he would be away for half a day,\r\nbut never for more.  Stephen rigidly observed the Doctor's advice\r\nherself, and gave strict orders that his instructions were to be obeyed.\r\n\r\nHarold himself went through a period of mental suffering.  It was agony\r\nto him to think of Stephen being so near at hand, and yet not to be able\r\nto see her, or even to hear her voice.  All the pain of his loss of her\r\naffection seemed to crowd back on him, and with it the new need of\r\nescaping from her unknown.  More than ever he felt it would not do that\r\nshe should ever learn his identity.  Her pity for him, and possibly her\r\nwoman's regard for a man's effort in time of stress, might lead through\r\nthe gates of her own self-sacrifice to his restoration to his old place\r\nin her affections.  Nay! it could not be his old place; for at the close\r\nof those days she had learned of his love for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV--A CRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third week had nearly elapsed, and as yet no one was allowed to see\r\nthe patient.\r\n\r\nFor a time Stephen was inclined to be chagrined.  It is not pleasant to\r\nhave even the most generous and benevolent intentions thwarted; and she\r\nhad set her mind on making much of this man whom fate and his own bravery\r\nhad thrown athwart her life.  But in these days Stephen was in some ways\r\na changed woman.  She had so much that she wished to forget and that she\r\nwould have given worlds to recall, that she could not bear even to think\r\nof any militant or even questioning attitude.  She even began to take\r\nherself to task more seriously than she had ever done with regard to\r\nsocial and conventional duties.  When she found her house full of so many\r\nand so varied guests, it was borne in upon her that such a position as\r\nher own, with such consequent duties, called for the presence of some\r\nelder person of her own sex and of her own class.\r\n\r\nNo better proof of Stephen's intellectual process and its result could be\r\nadduced than her first act of recognition: she summoned an elderly lady\r\nto live with her and matronise her house.  This lady, the widow of a\r\ndistant relation, complied with all the charted requirements of\r\nrespectability, and had what to Stephen's eyes was a positive gift: that\r\nof minding her own business and not interfering in any matter whatever.\r\nLady de Lannoy, she felt, was her own master and quite able to take care\r\nof herself.  Her own presence was all that convention required.  So she\r\nlimited herself to this duty, with admirable result to all, herself\r\nincluded.  After a few days Stephen would almost forget that she was\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nMr. Hilton kept bravely to his undertaking.  He never gave even a hint of\r\nhis hopes of the restoration of sight; and he was so assiduous in his\r\nattention that there arose no opportunity of accidental discovery of the\r\nsecret.  He knew that when the time did come he would find himself in a\r\nvery unpleasant situation.  Want of confidence, and even of intentional\r\ndeceit, might be attributed to him; and he would not be able to deny nor\r\nexplain.  He was, however; determined to stick to his word.  If he could\r\nbut save his patient's sight he would be satisfied.\r\n\r\nBut to Stephen all the mystery seemed to grow out of its first shadowy\r\nimportance into something real.  There was coming to her a vague idea\r\nthat she would do well not to manifest any concern, any anxiety, any\r\ncuriosity.  Instinct was at work; she was content to trust it, and wait.\r\n\r\nOne forenoon she received by messenger a letter which interested her\r\nmuch.  So much that at first she was unwilling to show it to anyone, and\r\ntook it to her own boudoir to read over again in privacy.  She had a sort\r\nof feeling of expectancy with regard to it; such as sensitive natures\r\nfeel before a thunderstorm.  The letter was natural enough in itself.  It\r\nwas dated that morning from Varilands, a neighbouring estate which\r\nmarched with Lannoy to the south.\r\n\r\n   'MY DEAR MADAM,--Will you pardon me a great liberty, and allow my\r\n   little girl and me to come to see you to-day?  I shall explain when we\r\n   meet.  When I say that we are Americans and have come seven thousand\r\n   miles for the purpose, you will, I am sure, understand that it is no\r\n   common interest which has brought us, and it will be the excuse for\r\n   our eagerness.  I should write you more fully, but as the matter is a\r\n   confidential one I thought it would be better to speak.  We shall be\r\n   doubly grateful if you will have the kindness to see us alone.  I\r\n   write as a mother in making this appeal to your kindness; for my\r\n   child--she is only a little over eight years old--has the matter so\r\n   deeply in her heart that any disappointment or undue delay would I\r\n   fear affect her health.  We presume to take your kindness for granted\r\n   and will call a little before twelve o'clock.\r\n\r\n   'I may perhaps say (in case you should feel any hesitation as to my\r\n   _bona fides_) that my husband purchased some years ago this estate.  We\r\n   were to have come here to live in the early summer, but were kept in\r\n   the West by some important business of his.\r\n\r\n   'Believe me, yours sincerely,\r\n   'ALICE STONEHOUSE.'\r\n\r\nStephen had, of course, no hesitation as to receiving the lady.  Even had\r\nthere been objection, the curiosity she had in common with her kind would\r\nhave swept difficulties aside.  She gave orders that when Mrs. Stonehouse\r\narrived with her daughter they were to be shown at once into the Mandarin\r\ndrawing-room.  That they would probably stay for lunch.  She would see\r\nthem alone.\r\n\r\nA little before twelve o'clock Mrs. Stonehouse and Pearl arrived, and\r\nwere shown into the room where Lady de Lannoy awaited them.  The high\r\nsun, streaming in from the side, shone on her beautiful hair, making it\r\nlook like living gold.  When the Americans came in they were for an\r\ninstant entranced by her beauty.  One glance at Mrs. Stonehouse's sweet\r\nsympathetic face was enough to establish her in Stephen's good graces\r\nforever.  As for Pearl, she was like one who has unexpectedly seen a\r\nfairy or a goddess.  She had been keeping guardedly behind her mother,\r\nbut on the instant she came out fearlessly into the open.\r\n\r\nStephen advanced quickly and shook hands with Mrs. Stonehouse, saying\r\nheartily:\r\n\r\n'I am so glad you have come.  I am honoured in being trusted.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you so much, Lady de Lannoy.  I felt that you would not mind,\r\nespecially when you know why we came.  Indeed I had no choice.  Pearl\r\ninsisted on it; and when Pearl is urgent--we who love her have all to\r\ngive way.  This is Pearl!'\r\n\r\nIn an instant Stephen was on her knees by the beautiful child.\r\n\r\nThe red rosebud of a mouth was raised to her kiss, and the little arms\r\nwent lovingly round her neck and clung to her.  As the mother looked on\r\ndelighted she thought she had never seen a more beautiful sight.  The two\r\nfaces so different, and yet with so much in common.  The red hair and the\r\nflaxen, both tints of gold.  The fine colour of each heightened to a\r\nbright flush in their eagerness.  Stephen was so little used to children,\r\nand yet loved them so, that all the womanhood in her, which is possible\r\nmotherhood, went out in an instant to the lovely eager child.  She felt\r\nthe keenest pleasure when the little thing, having rubbed her silk-gloved\r\npalms over her face, and then holding her away so that she could see her\r\nmany beauties, whispered in her ear:\r\n\r\n'How pretty you are!'\r\n\r\n'You darling!' whispered Stephen in reply.  'We must love each other very\r\nmuch, you and I!'\r\n\r\nWhen the two ladies had sat down, Stephen holding Pearl in her lap, Mrs.\r\nStonehouse said:\r\n\r\n'I suppose you have wondered, Lady de Lannoy, what has brought us here?'\r\n\r\n'Indeed I was very much interested.'\r\n\r\n'Then I had better tell you all from the beginning so that you may\r\nunderstand.'  She proceeded to give the details of the meeting with Mr.\r\nRobinson on the _Scoriac_.  Of how Pearl took to him and insisted on\r\nmaking him her special friend; of the terrible incident of her being\r\nswept overboard, and of the gallant rescue.  Mrs. Stonehouse was much\r\nmoved as she spoke.  All that fearful time, of which the minutes had\r\nseemed years of agony, came back to her so vividly at times that she\r\ncould hardly speak.  Pearl listened too; all eagerness, but without fear.\r\nStephen was greatly moved and held Pearl close to her all the time, as\r\nthough protecting her.  When the mother spoke of her feeling when she saw\r\nthe brave man struggling up and down the giant waves, and now and again\r\nlosing sight of him in the trough of the sea, she put out one hand and\r\nheld the mother's with a grasp which vibrated in sympathy, whilst the\r\ngreat tears welled over in her eyes and ran down her cheeks.  Pearl,\r\nwatching her keenly, said nothing, but taking her tiny cambric\r\nhandkerchief from her pocket silently wiped the tears away, and clung all\r\nthe tighter.  It was her turn to protect now!\r\n\r\nPearl's own time for tears came when her mother began to tell this new\r\nand sympathetic friend of how she became so much attached to her rescuer\r\nthat when she knew he would not be coming to the West with them, but\r\ngoing off to the wildest region of the far North, her health became\r\nimpaired; and that it was only when Mr. Robinson promised to come back to\r\nsee her within three years that she was at all comforted.  And how, ever\r\nsince, she had held the man in her heart and thought of him every day;\r\nsleeping as well as waking, for he was a factor in her dreams!\r\n\r\nStephen was more than ever moved, for the child's constancy touched her\r\nas well as her grief.  She strained the little thing in her strong young\r\narms, as though the fervency of her grasp would bring belief and comfort;\r\nas it did.  She in her turn dried the others' eyes.  Then Mrs. Stonehouse\r\nwent on with her story:\r\n\r\n'We were at Banff, high up in the Rockies, when we read of the burning\r\nand wrecking of the _Dominion_.  It is, as you know, a Montreal boat of\r\nthe Allan Line; so that naturally there was a full telegraphic report in\r\nall the Canadian papers.  When we read of the brave man who swam ashore\r\nwith the line and who was unable to reach the port but swam out across\r\nthe bay, Pearl took it for granted that it must have been \"The Man,\" as\r\nshe always called Mr. Robinson.  When by the next paper we learned that\r\nthe man's name _was_ Robinson nothing would convince her that it was not\r\n_her_ Mr. Robinson.  My husband, I may tell you, had firmly come to the\r\nsame conclusion.  He had ever since the rescue of our child always looked\r\nfor any news from Alaska, whither he knew Mr. Robinson had gone.  He\r\nlearned that up away in the very far North a new goldfield had been\r\ndiscovered by a man of the same name; and that a new town, Robinson City,\r\nbegan to grow up in the wilderness, where the condition of life from the\r\ncold was a new experience to even the most hardy gold miners.  Then we\r\nbegan to think that the young hero who had so gallantly saved our darling\r\nwas meeting some of his reward . . . !'\r\n\r\nShe paused, her voice breaking.  Stephen was in a glow of holy feeling.\r\nGladness, joy, gratitude, enthusiasm; she knew not which.  It all seemed\r\nlike a noble dream which was coming true.  Mrs. Stonehouse went on:-\r\n\r\n'From Californian papers of last month we learned that Robinson, of\r\nRobinson City, had sailed for San Francisco, but had disappeared when the\r\nship touched at Portland; and then the whole chain of his identity seemed\r\ncomplete.  Nothing would satisfy Pearl but that we should come at once to\r\nEngland and see \"The Man,\" who was wounded and blind, and do what we\r\ncould for him.  Her father could not then come himself; he had important\r\nwork on hand which he could not leave without some preparation.  But he\r\nis following us and may be here at any time.\r\n\r\n'And now, we want you to help us, Lady de Lannoy.  We are not sure yet of\r\nthe identity of Mr. Robinson, but we shall know the instant we see him,\r\nor hear his voice.  We have learned that he is still here.  Won't you let\r\nus?  Do let us see him as soon as ever you can!'  There was a pleading\r\ntone in her voice which alone would have moved Stephen, even had she not\r\nbeen wrought up already by the glowing fervour of her new friend.\r\n\r\nBut she paused.  She did not know what to say; how to tell them that as\r\nyet she herself knew nothing.  She, too, in the depths of her own heart\r\nknew--_knew_--that it was the same Robinson.  And she also knew that both\r\nidentities were one with another.  The beating of her heart and the wild\r\nsurging of her blood told her all.  She was afraid to speak lest her\r\nvoice should betray her.\r\n\r\nShe could not even think.  She would have to be alone for that.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stonehouse, with the wisdom and power of age, waited, suspending\r\njudgment.  But Pearl was in a fever of anxiety; she could imagine nothing\r\nwhich could keep her away from The Man.  But she saw that there was some\r\ndifficulty, some cause of delay.  So she too added her pleading.  Putting\r\nher mouth close to Lady de Lannoy's ear she whispered very faintly, very\r\ncaressingly:\r\n\r\n'What is your name?  Your own name?  Your very own name?'\r\n\r\n'Stephen, my darling!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, won't you let us see The Man, Stephen; dear Stephen!  I love him so;\r\nand I do _so_ want to see him.  It is ages till I see him!  Won't you let\r\nme?  I shall be so good--Stephen!'  And she strained her closer in her\r\nlittle arms and kissed her all over face, cheeks and forehead and eyes\r\nand mouth wooingly.  Stephen returned the embrace and the kisses, but\r\nremained silent a little longer.  Then she found voice:\r\n\r\n'I hardly know what to say.  Believe me, I should--I shall, do all I can;\r\nbut the fact is that I am not in authority.  The Doctor has taken him in\r\ncharge and will not let anyone go near him: He will not even have a\r\nnurse, but watches and attends to him himself.  He says it might be fatal\r\nif anything should occur to agitate him.  Why, even I am not allowed to\r\nsee him!'\r\n\r\n'Haven't you seen him yet at all; ever, ever, Stephen?' asked Pearl, all\r\nher timidity gone.  Stephen smiled--a wan smile it was, as she answered:\r\n\r\n'I saw him in the water, but it was too far away to distinguish.  And it\r\nwas only by firelight.'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes, I know,' said Pearl; 'Mother and Daddy told me how you had\r\nburned the house down to give him light.  Didn't you want to see him more\r\nafter that?  I should!'  Stephen drew the impulsive child closer as she\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n'Indeed I did, dear.  But I had to think of what was good for him.  I\r\nwent to his room the next day when he was awake, and the Doctor let me\r\ncome in for only a moment.'\r\n\r\n'Well!  What did you see.  Didn't you know him?'  She forgot that the\r\nother did not know him from her point of view.  But the question went\r\nthrough Stephen's heart like a sword.  What would she not have given to\r\nhave known him!  What would she not give to know him now! . . . She spoke\r\nmechanically:\r\n\r\n'The room was quite dark.  It is necessary, the Doctor says, that he be\r\nkept in the dark.  I saw only a big beard, partly burned away by the\r\nfire; and a great bandage which covered his eyes!'  Pearl's hold relaxed,\r\nshe slipped like an eel to the floor and ran over to her mother.  Her new\r\nfriend was all very well, but no one would do as well as mother when she\r\nwas in trouble.\r\n\r\n'Oh mother, mother!  My Robinson had no beard!'  Her mother stroked her\r\nface comfortingly as she answered:\r\n\r\n'But, my dear, it is more than two years since you saw him.  Two years\r\nand three months, for it was in June that we crossed.'  How the date\r\nthrilled Stephen.  It verified her assumption.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stonehouse did not notice, but went on:\r\n\r\n'His beard would have grown.  Men wear beards up in the cold place where\r\nhe was.'  Pearl kissed her; there was no need for words.  Throwing\r\nherself again on Stephen's knees she went on with her questioning:\r\n\r\n'But didn't you hear him?'\r\n\r\n'I heard very little, darling.  He was very weak.  It was only the\r\nmorning after the wreck, and he spoke in a whisper!'  Then with an\r\ninstinct of self-preservation she added: 'But how could I learn anything\r\nby hearing him when he was a stranger to me?  I had never even heard of\r\nMr. Robinson!'\r\n\r\nAs she was speaking she found her own ideas, the proofs of her own\r\nconviction growing.  This was surely another link in the chain of proving\r\nthat all three men were but one.  But in such case Harold must know; must\r\nhave tried to hide his identity!\r\n\r\nShe feared, with keen eyes upon her, to pursue the thought.  But her\r\nblood began to grow cold and her brain to swim.  With an effort she went\r\non:\r\n\r\n'Even since then I have not been allowed to go near him.  Of course I\r\nmust obey orders.  I am waiting as patiently as I can.  But we must ask\r\nthe Doctor if he thinks his patient will see you--will let you see\r\nhim--though he will not let me.'  This she added with a touch of what she\r\nfelt: regret rather than bitter ness.  There was no room for bitterness\r\nin her full heart where Harold was concerned.\r\n\r\n'Will you ask the Doctor now?'  Pearl did not let grass grow under her\r\nfeet.  For answer Stephen rang the bell, and when a servant appeared\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n'Is Mr. Hilton in the house?'\r\n\r\n'I think not, your Ladyship.  He said he was going over to Port Lannoch.\r\nShall I inquire if he left word at what time he would be back?'\r\n\r\n'If you please!'  The man returned in a few minutes with the butler, who\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Hilton said, your Ladyship, that he expected to be back by one\r\no'clock at latest.'\r\n\r\n'Please ask him on his arrival if he will kindly come here at once.  Do\r\nnot let us be disturbed until then.'  The butler bowed and withdrew.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said Stephen, 'as we have to wait till our tyrant comes, won't you\r\ntell me all that went on after The Man had left you?'  Pearl brightened\r\nup at once.  Stephen would have given anything to get away even for a\r\nwhile.  Beliefs and hopes and fears were surging up, till she felt\r\nchoking.  But the habit of her life, especially her life of the last two\r\nyears, gave her self-control.  And so she waited, trying with all her\r\nmight to follow the child's prattle.\r\n\r\nAfter a long wait Pearl exclaimed: 'Oh!  I do wish that Doctor would\r\ncome.  I want to see The Man!'  She was so restless, marching about the\r\nroom, that Stephen said:\r\n\r\n'Would you like to go out on the balcony, darling; of course if Mother\r\nwill let you?  It is quite safe, I assure you, Mrs. Stonehouse.  It is\r\nwide and open and is just above the flower-borders, with a stone tail.\r\nYou can see the road from it by which Mr. Hilton comes from Port Lannoch.\r\nHe will be riding.'  Pearl yielded at once to the diversion.  It would at\r\nany rate be something to do, to watch.  Stephen opened the French window\r\nand the child ran out on the balcony.\r\n\r\nWhen Stephen came back to her seat Mrs. Stonehouse said quietly:\r\n\r\n'I am glad she is away for a few minutes.  She has been over wrought, and\r\nI am always afraid for her.  She is so sensitive.  And after all she is\r\nonly a baby!'\r\n\r\n'She is a darling!' said Stephen impulsively; and she meant it.  Mrs.\r\nStonehouse smiled gratefully as she went on:\r\n\r\n'I suppose you noticed what a hold on her imagination that episode of\r\nMollie Watford at the bank had.  Mr. Stonehouse is, as perhaps you know,\r\na very rich man.  He has made his fortune himself, and most honourably;\r\nand we are all very proud of him, and of it.  So Pearl does not think of\r\nthe money for itself.  But the feeling was everything; she really loves\r\nMr. Robinson; as indeed she ought!  He has done so much for us that it\r\nwould be a pride and a privilege for us to show our gratitude.  My\r\nhusband, between ourselves, wanted to make him his partner.  He tells me\r\nthat, quite independent of our feeling towards him, he is just the man he\r\nwanted.  And if indeed it was he who discovered the Alaskan goldfield and\r\norganised and ruled Robinson City, it is a proof that Mr. Stonehouse's\r\njudgment was sound.  Now he is injured, and blind; and our little Pearl\r\nloves him.  If indeed he be the man we believe he is, then we may be able\r\nto do something which all his millions cannot buy.  He will come to us,\r\nand be as a son to us, and a brother to Pearl.  We will be his eyes; and\r\nnothing but love and patience will guide his footsteps!'  She paused, her\r\nmouth quivering; then she went on:\r\n\r\n'If it is not our Mr. Robinson, then it will be our pleasure to do all\r\nthat is necessary for his comfort.  If he is a poor man he will never\r\nwant . . . It will be a privilege to save so gallant a man from hardship\r\n. . . '  Here she came to a stop.\r\n\r\nStephen too was glad of the pause, for the emotion which the words and\r\ntheir remembrances evoked was choking her.  Had not Harold been as her\r\nown father's son.  As her own brother! . . . She turned away, fearing\r\nlest her face should betray her.\r\n\r\nAll at once Mrs. Stonehouse started to her feet, her face suddenly white\r\nwith fear; for a cry had come to their ears.  A cry which even Stephen\r\nknew as Pearl's.  The mother ran to the window.\r\n\r\nThe balcony was empty.  She came back into the room, and, ran to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nBut on the instant a voice that both women knew was heard from without:\r\n\r\n'Help there!  Help, I say!  The child has fainted.  Is there no one\r\nthere?  And I am blind!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI--LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nHarold had been in a state of increasing restlessness.  The month of\r\nwaiting which Dr. Hilton had laid down for him seemed to wear away with\r\nextraordinary slowness; this was increased by the lack of companionship,\r\nand further by the cutting off of even the little episodes usual to daily\r\nlife.  His patience, great as it was naturally and trained as it had been\r\nby the years of self-repression, was beginning to give way.  Often and\r\noften there came over him a wild desire to tear off the irksome bandages\r\nand try for himself whether the hopes held out to him were being even\r\npartially justified.  He was restrained only by the fear of perpetual\r\nblindness, which came over him in a sort of cold wave at each reaction.\r\nTime, too, added to his fear of discovery; but he could not but think\r\nthat his self-sought isolation must be a challenge to the curiosity of\r\neach and all who knew of it.  And with all these disturbing causes came\r\nthe main one, which never lessened but always grew: that whatever might\r\nhappen Stephen would be further from him than ever.  Look at the matter\r\nhow he would; turn it round in whatsoever possible or impossible way, he\r\ncould see no relief to this gloomy conclusion.\r\n\r\nFor it is in the nature of love that it creates or enlarges its own pain.\r\nIf troubles or difficulties there be from natural causes, then it will\r\nexaggerate them into nightmare proportions.  But if there be none, it\r\nwill create them.  Love is in fact the most serious thing that comes to\r\nman; where it exists all else seem as phantoms, or at best as actualities\r\nof lesser degree.  During the better part of two years his troubles had\r\nbut slept; and as nothing wakes the pangs of old love better than the\r\nsound of a voice, all the old acute pain of love and the agony that\r\nfollowed its denial were back with him.  Surely he could never, never\r\nbelieve that Stephen did not mean what she had said to him that morning\r\nin the beech grove.  All his new resolution not to hamper her with the\r\nburden of a blind and lonely-hearted man was back to the full.\r\n\r\nIn such mood had he been that morning.  He was additionally disturbed\r\nbecause the Doctor had gone early to Port Lannoch; and as he was the only\r\nperson with whom he could talk, he clung to him with something of the\r\nhelpless feeling of a frightened child to its nurse.\r\n\r\nThe day being full of sunshine the window was open, and only the dark-\r\ngreen blind which crackled and rustled with every passing breeze made the\r\ndarkness of the room.  Harold was dressed and lay on a sofa placed back\r\nin the room, where the few rays of light thus entering could not reach\r\nhim.  His eyes and forehead were bandaged as ever.  For some days the\r\nDoctor, who had his own reasons and his own purpose, had not taken them\r\noff; so the feeling of blind helplessness was doubly upon him.  He knew\r\nhe was blind; and he knew also that if he were not he could not in his\r\npresent condition see.\r\n\r\nAll at once he started up awake.  His hearing had in the weeks of\r\ndarkness grown abnormally acute, and some trifling sound had recalled him\r\nto himself.  It might have been inspiration, but he seemed to be\r\nconscious of some presence in the room.\r\n\r\nAs he rose from the sofa, with the violent motion of a strong man\r\nstartled into unconscious activity, he sent a shock of fear to the eager\r\nchild who had strayed into the room through the open window.  Had he\r\npresented a normal appearance, she would not have been frightened.  She\r\nwould have recognised his identity despite the changes, and have sprung\r\nto him so impulsively that she would have been in his arms before she had\r\ntime to think.  But now all she saw was a great beard topped with a mass\r\nof linen and lint, which obscured all the rest of the face and seemed in\r\nthe gloom like a gigantic and ominous turban.\r\n\r\nIn her fright she screamed out.  He in turn, forgetful for the moment of\r\nhis intention of silence, called aloud:\r\n\r\n'Who is that?'  Pearl, who had been instinctively backing towards the\r\nwindow by which she had entered, and whose thoughts in her fright had\r\ngone back to her mother--refuge in time of danger--cried out:\r\n\r\n'Mother, Mother!  It is him!  It is The Man!'  She would have run towards\r\nhim in spite of his forbidding appearance; but the shock had been too\r\nmuch for her.  The little knees trembled and gave way; the brain reeled;\r\nand with a moan she sank on the floor in a swoon.\r\n\r\nHarold knew the voice the instant she spoke; there was no need for the\r\nenlightening words\r\n\r\n'Pearl!  Pearl!' he cried.  'Come to me, darling!'  But as he spoke he\r\nheard her moan, and the soft thud of her little body on the thick carpet.\r\nHe guessed the truth and groped his way towards where the sound had been,\r\nfor he feared lest he might trample upon her in too great eagerness.\r\nKneeling by her he touched her little feet, and then felt his way to her\r\nface.  And as he did so, such is the double action of the mind, even in\r\nthe midst of his care the remembrance swept across his mind of how he had\r\nonce knelt in just such manner in an old church by another little\r\nsenseless form.  In his confusion of mind he lost the direction of the\r\ndoor, and coming to the window pushed forward the flapping blind and went\r\nout on the balcony.  He knew from the freshness of the air and the\r\ndistant sounds that he was in the open.  This disturbed him, as he wished\r\nto find someone who could attend to the fainting child.  But as he had\r\nlost the way back to the room now, he groped along the wall of the Castle\r\nwith one hand, whilst he held Pearl securely in the other.  As he went he\r\ncalled out for help.\r\n\r\nWhen he came opposite the window of the Mandarin room Mrs. Stonehouse saw\r\nhim; she ran to him and caught Pearl in her arms.  She was so agitated,\r\nso lost in concern for the child that she never even thought to speak to\r\nthe man whom she had come so far to seek.  She wailed over the child:\r\n\r\n'Pearl!  Pearl!  What is it, darling?  It is Mother!'  She laid the girl\r\non the sofa, and taking the flowers out of a glass began to sprinkle\r\nwater on the child's face.  Harold knew her voice and waited in patience.\r\nPresently the child sighed; the mother, relieved, thought of other things\r\nat last and looked around her.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another trouble.  There on the floor, where she had slipped\r\ndown, lay Lady de Lannoy in a swoon.  She called out instinctively,\r\nforgetting for the moment that the man was blind, but feeling all the old\r\nconfidence which he had won in her heart:\r\n\r\n'Oh!  Mr. Robinson, help me!  Lady de Lannoy has fainted too, and I do\r\nnot know what to do!'  As she spoke she looked up at him and remembered\r\nhis blindness.  But she had no time to alter her words; the instant she\r\nhad spoken Harold, who had been leaning against the window-sash, and\r\nwhose mind was calmer since with his acute hearing he too had heard Pearl\r\nsigh, seemed to leap into the room.\r\n\r\n'Where is she?  Where is she?  Oh, God, now am I blind indeed!'\r\n\r\nIt gave her a pang to hear him and to see him turn helplessly with his\r\narms and hands outstretched as though he would feel for her in the air.\r\n\r\nWithout pause, and under an instinctive and uncontrollable impulse, he\r\ntore the bandages from his eyes.  The sun was streaming in.  As he met it\r\nhis eyes blinked and a cry burst from him; a wild cry whose joy and\r\nsurprise pierced even through the shut portals of the swooning woman's\r\nbrain.  Not for worlds would she ever after have lost the memory of that\r\nsound:\r\n\r\n'Light! light!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  I am not blind!'\r\n\r\nBut he looked round him still in terrified wonder:\r\n\r\n'Where is she?  Where is she?  I cannot see her!  Stephen!  Stephen!\r\nwhere are you?'  Mrs. Stonehouse, bewildered, pointed where Stephen's\r\nsnow-white face and brilliant hair seemed in the streaming sunlight like\r\nivory and gold:\r\n\r\n'There!  There!'  He caught her arm mechanically, and putting his eyes to\r\nher wrist, tried to look along her pointed finger.  In an instant he\r\ndropped her arm moaning.\r\n\r\n'I cannot see her!  What is it that is over me?  This is worse than to be\r\nblind!'  He covered his face with his hands and sobbed.\r\n\r\nHe felt light strong fingers on his forehead and hands; fingers whose\r\ntouch he would have known had they been laid on him were he no longer\r\nquick.  A voice whose music he had heard in his dreams for two long years\r\nsaid softly:\r\n\r\n'I am here, Harold!  I am here!  Oh! do not sob like that; it breaks my\r\nheart to hear you!'  He took his hands from his face and held hers in\r\nthem, staring intently at her as though his passionate gaze would win\r\nthrough every obstacle.\r\n\r\nThat moment he never forgot.  Never could forget!  He saw the room all\r\nrich in yellow.  He saw Pearl, pale but glad-eyed, lying on a sofa\r\nholding the hand of her mother, who stood beside her.  He saw the great\r\nhigh window open, the lines of the covered stone balcony without, the\r\nstretch of green sward all vivid in the sunshine, and beyond it the blue\r\nquivering sea.  He saw all but that for which his very soul longed;\r\nwithout to see which sight itself was valueless . . . But still he\r\nlooked, and looked; and Stephen saw in his dark eyes, though he could not\r\nsee her, that which made her own eyes fill and the warm red glow on her\r\nface again . . . Then she raised her eyes again, and the gladness of her\r\nbeating heart seemed the answer to his own.\r\n\r\nFor as he looked he saw, as though emerging from a mist whose obscurity\r\nmelted with each instant, what was to him the one face in all the world.\r\nHe did not think then of its beauty--that would come later; and besides\r\nno beauty of one born of woman could outmatch the memorised beauty which\r\nhad so long held his heart.  But that he had so schooled himself in long\r\nmonths of gloomy despair, he would have taken her in his arms there and\r\nthen; and, heedless of the presence of others, have poured out his full\r\nheart to her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stonehouse saw and understood.  So too Pearl, who though a child was\r\na woman-child; softly they rose up to steal away.  But Stephen saw them;\r\nher own instincts, too, told her that her hour had not come.  What she\r\nhoped for must come alone!  So she called to her guests:\r\n\r\n'Don't go!  Don't go, Mrs. Stonehouse.  You know now that Harold and I\r\nare old friends, though neither of us knew it--till this moment.  We were\r\nbrought up as . . . almost as brother and sister.  Pearl, isn't it lovely\r\nto see your friend . . . to see The Man again?'\r\n\r\nShe was so happy that she could only express herself, with dignity,\r\nthrough the happiness of others.\r\n\r\nPearl actually shrieked with joy as she rushed across the room and flung\r\nherself into Harold's arms as he stooped to her.  He raised her; and she\r\nkissed him again and again, and put her little hands all over his face\r\nand stroked, very, very gently, his eyes, and said:\r\n\r\n'Oh, I am so glad!  And so glad your poor eyes are unbind again!  May I\r\ncall you Harold, too?'\r\n\r\n'You darling!' was all he could say as he kissed her, and holding her in\r\none arm went across and shook hands with Mrs. Stonehouse, who wrung his\r\nhand hard.\r\n\r\nThere was a little awkwardness in the group, for none of them knew what\r\nwould be best to do next.  In the midst of it there came a light knock at\r\nthe door, and Mr. Hilton entered saying:\r\n\r\n'They told me you wished to see me at once--Hulloa!'  He rushed across\r\nthe room and took Harold by the shoulders, turning his face to the light.\r\nHe looked in his eyes long and earnestly, the others holding their\r\nbreaths.  Presently he said, without relaxing his gaze:\r\n\r\n'Did you see mistily at first?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Seeing at the periphery; but the centre being opaque?'\r\n\r\n'Yes!  How did you know?  Why, I couldn't see'--see pointing to\r\nStephen--'Lady de Lannoy; though her face was right in front of me!'\r\n\r\nDr. Hilton took his hands from his patient's shoulders and shook him\r\nwarmly by both hands:-\r\n\r\n'I am glad, old fellow!  It was worth waiting for, wasn't it?  But I say,\r\nit was a dangerous thing to take off those bandages before I permitted.\r\nHowever, it has done no harm!  But it was lucky that I mistrusted your\r\npatience and put the time for the experiment a week later than I thought\r\nnecessary . . . What is it?'  He turned from one to the other\r\nquestioningly; there was a look on Harold's face that he did not quite\r\ncomprehend.\r\n\r\n'H-s-h,' said the latter warningly, 'I'll tell you all about it . . .\r\nsome time!'\r\n\r\nThe awkward pause was broken by Pearl, who came to the Doctor and said:\r\n\r\n'I must kiss you, you know.  It was you who saved The Man's eyes.  Stephen\r\nhas told me how you watched him!'  The Doctor was somewhat taken aback;\r\nas yet he was ignorant of Pearl's existence.  However, he raised the\r\nchild in his arms and kissed her, saying:\r\n\r\n'Thank you, my dear!  I did all I could.  But he helped much himself;\r\nexcept at the very last.  Don't you ever go and take off bandages, if you\r\nshould ever have the misfortune to have them on, without the doctor's\r\npermission!'  Pearl nodded her head wisely and then wriggled out of his\r\narms and came again to Harold, looking up at him protectingly and saying\r\nin an old-fashioned way:\r\n\r\n'How are you feeling now?  None the worse, I hope, _Harold_!'\r\n\r\nThe Man lifted her up and kissed her again.  When he set her down she\r\ncame over to Lady de Lannoy and held up her arms to be lifted:\r\n\r\n'And I must kiss you again too, Stephen!'  If Lady de Lannoy hadn't loved\r\nthe sweet little thing already she would have loved her for that!\r\n\r\nThe door was opened, and the butler announced:\r\n\r\n'Luncheon is served, your Ladyship.'\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAfter a few days Harold went over to Varilands to stay for a while with\r\nthe Stonehouses.  Mr. Stonehouse had arrived, and both men were rejoiced\r\nto meet again.  The elder never betrayed by word or sign that he\r\nrecognised the identity of the other person of the drama of whom he had\r\ntold him and who had come so accidentally into his life; and the younger\r\nwas grateful to him for it.  Harold went almost every day to Lannoy, and\r\nsometimes the Stonehouses went with him; at other times Stephen paid\r\nflying visits to Varilands.  She did not make any effort to detain\r\nHarold; she would not for worlds have made a sign which might influence\r\nhim.  She was full now of that diffidence which every woman has who\r\nloves.  She felt that she must wait; must wait even if the waiting lasted\r\nto her grave.  She felt, as every woman does who really loves, that she\r\nhad found her Master.\r\n\r\nAnd Harold, to whom something of the same diffidence was an old story,\r\ngot the idea that her reticence was a part of the same feeling whose\r\nviolent expression had sent him out into the wilderness.  And with the\r\nthought came the idea of his duty, implied in her father's dying trust:\r\n'Give her time! . . . Let her choose!'  For him the clock seemed to have\r\nstopped for two whole years, and he was back at the time when the\r\nguardianship of his boy life was beginning to yield to the larger and\r\nmore selfish guardianship of manhood.\r\n\r\nStephen, noticing that he did not come near her as closely as she felt he\r\nmight, and not realising his true reason--for when did love ever realise\r\nthe true reason of the bashfulness of love?--felt a chillness which in\r\nturn reacted on her own manner.\r\n\r\nAnd so these two ardent souls, who yearned for each other's love and the\r\nfull expression of it, seemed as if they might end after all in drifting\r\napart.  Each thought that their secret was concealed.  But both secrets\r\nwere already known to Mrs. Stonehouse, who knew nothing; and to Mr.\r\nStonehouse, who knew everything.  Even Pearl had her own ideas, as was\r\nonce shown in a confidence when they were alone in Stephen's bedroom\r\nafter helping her to finish her dressing, just as Stephen herself had at\r\na similar age helped her Uncle Gilbert.  After some coy leading up to the\r\nsubject of pretty dresses, the child putting her little mouth to the\r\nother's ear whispered:\r\n\r\n'May I be your bridesmaid, Stephen?'  The woman was taken aback; but she\r\nhad to speak at once, for the child's eyes were on her:\r\n\r\n'Of course you will, darling.  But I--I may never be married.'\r\n\r\n'You!  You must!  I know someone who will make you!'  Stephen's heart\r\nbeat hard and rapidly.  The child's talk, though sweet and dear, was more\r\nthan embarrassing.  With, however, the desire to play with fire, which is\r\na part of the nature of women, she answered:\r\n\r\n'You have some queer ideas, little one, in that pretty knowledge-box of\r\nyours.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! he never told me.  But I know it all the same!  And you know it too,\r\nStephen!'  This was getting too close to be without danger; so she tried\r\nto divert the thought from herself:\r\n\r\n'My darling, you may guess about other people, though I don't say you\r\nought; but you must not guess about me!'\r\n\r\n'All right!' then she held up her arms to be lifted on the other's knee\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n'I want to whisper to you!'  Her voice and manner were so full of feeling\r\nthat somehow the other was moved.  She bent her head, and Pearl taking\r\nher neck in her little palms, said:\r\n\r\n'I thought, oh! long ago, that I would marry him myself.  But you knew\r\nhim first . . . And he only saved me . . . But you saved him!' . . . And\r\nthen she laid her head down on the throbbing bosom, and sobbed . . .\r\n\r\nAnd Stephen sobbed too.\r\n\r\nBefore they left the room, Stephen said to her, very gravely, for the\r\nissue might be one of great concern:\r\n\r\n'Of course, Pearl dear, our secrets are all between ourselves!'  Pearl\r\ncrossed her two forefingers and kissed them.  But she said nothing; she\r\nhad sworn!  Stephen went on:\r\n\r\n'And, darling, you will remember too that one must never speak or even\r\nthink if they can help it about anyone's marrying anyone else till they\r\nsay so themselves!  What is it, dear, that you are smiling at?'\r\n\r\n'I know, Stephen!  I musn't take off the bandage till the Doctor says\r\nso!'\r\n\r\nStephen smiled and kissed her.  Hand in hand, Pearl chattering merrily,\r\nthey went down to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII--GOLDEN SILENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nEach day that passed seemed to add to the trouble in the heart of these\r\nyoung people; to widen the difficulty of expressing themselves.  To\r\nStephen, who had accepted the new condition of things and whose whole\r\nnature had bloomed again under the sunshine of hope, it was the less\r\nintolerable.  She had set herself to wait, as had countless thousands of\r\nwomen before her; and as due proportion will, till the final cataclysm\r\nabolishes earthly unions.  But Harold felt the growth, both positive and\r\nnegative, as a new torture; and he began to feel that he would be unable\r\nto go through with it.  In his heart was the constant struggle of hope;\r\nand in opposition to it the seeming realisation of every new fancy of\r\nevil.  That bitter hour, when the whole of creation was for him turned\r\nupside down, was having its sad effect at last.  Had it not been for that\r\nhorrid remembrance he would have come to believe enough in himself to put\r\nhis future to the test.  He would have made an opportunity at which\r\nStephen and himself would have with the fires of their mutual love burned\r\naway the encircling mist.  There are times when a single minute of\r\ncommonsense would turn sorrow into joy; and yet that minute, our own\r\nnatures being the opposing forces, will be allowed to pass.\r\n\r\nThose who loved these young people were much concerned about them.  Mrs.\r\nStonehouse took their trouble so much to heart that she spoke to her\r\nhusband about it, seriously advising that one or other of them should\r\nmake an effort to bring things in the right way for their happiness.  The\r\nwoman was sure of the woman's feeling.  It is from men, not women, that\r\nwomen hide their love.  By side-glances and unthinking moments women note\r\nand learn.  The man knew already, from his own lips, of the man's\r\npassion.  But his lips were sealed by his loyalty; and he said earnestly:\r\n\r\n'My dear, we must not interfere.  Not now, at any rate; we might cause\r\nthem great trouble.  I am as sure as you are that they really love each\r\nother.  But they must win happiness by themselves and through themselves\r\nalone.  Otherwise it would never be to them what it ought to be; what it\r\nmight be; what it will be!'\r\n\r\nSo these friends were silent, and the little tragedy developed.  Harold's\r\npatience began to give way under the constant strain of self-suppression.\r\nStephen tried to hide her love and fear, under the mask of a gracious\r\ncalm.  This the other took for indifference.\r\n\r\nAt last there came an hour which was full of new, hopeless agony to\r\nStephen.  She heard Harold, in a fragment of conversation, speak to Mr.\r\nStonehouse of the need of returning to Alaska.  That sounded like a word\r\nof doom.  In her inmost heart she knew that Harold loved her; and had she\r\nbeen free she would have herself spoken the words which would have drawn\r\nthe full truth to them both.  But how could she do so, having the\r\nremembrance of that other episode; when, without the reality of love, she\r\nhad declared herself? . . . Oh! the shame of it . . . The folly! . . .\r\nAnd Harold knew it all!  How could he ever believe that it was real this\r\ntime! . . .\r\n\r\nBy the exercise of that self-restraint which long suffering had taught\r\nher, Stephen so managed to control herself that none of her guests\r\nrealised what a blow she had received from a casual word.  She bore\r\nherself gallantly till the last moment.  After the old fashion of her\r\nyouth, she had from the Castle steps seen their departure.  Then she took\r\nher way to her own room, and locked herself in.  She did not often, in\r\nthese days, give way to tears; when she did cry it was as a luxury, and\r\nnot from poignant cause.  Her deep emotion was dry-eyed as of old.  Now,\r\nshe did not cry, she sat still, her hands clasped below her knees, with\r\nset white face gazing out on the far-off sea.  For hours she sat there\r\nlonely; staring fixedly all the time, though her thoughts were whirling\r\nwildly.  At first she had some vague purpose, which she hoped might\r\neventually work out into a plan.  But thought would not come.  Everywhere\r\nthere was the same beginning: a wild, burning desire to let Harold\r\nunderstand her feeling towards him; to blot out, with the conviction of\r\ntrust and love, those bitter moments when in the madness of her\r\noverstrung passion she had heaped such insult upon him.  Everywhere the\r\nsame end: an impasse.  He seemingly could not, would not, understand.  She\r\nknew now that the man had diffidences, forbearances, self-judgments and\r\nself-denials which made for the suppression, in what he considered to be\r\nher interest, of his own desires.  This was tragedy indeed!  Again and\r\nagain came back the remembrance of that bitter regret of her Aunt\r\nLaetitia, which no happiness and no pain of her own had ever been able to\r\nefface:\r\n\r\n'To love; and be helpless!  To wait, and wait, and wait; with heart all\r\naflame!  To hope, and hope; till time seemed to have passed away, and all\r\nthe world to stand still on your hopeless misery!  To know that a word\r\nmight open up Heaven; and yet to have to remain mute!  To keep back the\r\nglances that could enlighten, to modulate the tones that might betray!  To\r\nsee all you hoped for passing away . . . !'\r\n\r\nAt last she seemed to understand the true force of pride; which has in it\r\na thousand forces of its own, positive, negative, restrainful.  Oh! how\r\nblind she had been!  How little she had learned from the miseries that\r\nthe other woman whom she loved had suffered!  How unsympathetic she had\r\nbeen; how self-engrossed; how callous to the sensibilities of others!  And\r\nnow to her, in her turn, had come the same suffering; the same galling of\r\nthe iron fetters of pride, and of convention which is its original\r\nexpression!  Must it be that the very salt of youth must lose its savour,\r\nbefore the joys of youth could be won!  What, after all, was youth if out\r\nof its own inherent power it must work its own destruction!  If youth was\r\nso, why not then trust the wisdom of age?  If youth could not act for its\r\nown redemption . . .\r\n\r\nHere the rudiment of a thought struck her and changed the current of her\r\nreason.  A thought so winged with hope that she dared not even try to\r\ncomplete it! . . . She thought, and thought till the long autumn shadows\r\nfell around her.  But the misty purpose had become real.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner she went up alone to the mill.  It was late for a visit, for\r\nthe Silver Lady kept early hours.  But she found her friend as usual in\r\nher room, whose windows swept the course of the sun.  Seeing that her\r\nvisitor was in a state of mental disturbance such as she had once before\r\nexhibited, she blew out the candles and took the same seat in the eastern\r\nwindow she had occupied on the night which they both so well remembered.\r\n\r\nStephen understood both acts, and was grateful afresh.  The darkness\r\nwould be a help to her in what she had to say; and the resumption of the\r\nold seat and attitude did away with the awkwardness of new confidence.\r\nDuring the weeks that had passed Stephen had kept her friend informed of\r\nthe rescue and progress of the injured man.  Since the discovery of\r\nHarold's identity she had allowed her to infer her feeling towards him.\r\n\r\nShyly she had conveyed her hopes that all the bitter part of the past\r\nmight be wiped out.  To the woman who already knew of the love that had\r\nalways been, but had only awakened to consciousness in the absence of its\r\nobject, a hint was sufficient to build upon.  She had noticed the gloom\r\nthat had of late been creeping over the girl's happiness; and she had\r\nbeen much troubled about it.  But she had thought it wiser to be silent;\r\nshe well knew that should unhappily the time for comfort come, it must be\r\nprecluded by new and more explicit confidence.  So she too had been\r\nanxiously waiting the progress of events.  Now; as she put her arms round\r\nthe girl she said softly; not in the whisper which implies doubt of some\r\nkind, but in the soft voices which conveys sympathy and trust:\r\n\r\n'Tell me, dear child!'\r\n\r\nAnd then in broken words shyly spoken, and spoken in such a way that the\r\nsilences were more eloquent than the words, the girl conveyed what was in\r\nher heart.  The other listened, now and again stroking the beautiful\r\nhair.  When all was said, there was a brief pause.  The Silver Lady spoke\r\nno word; but the pressure of her delicate hand conveyed sympathy.\r\n\r\nIn but a half-conscious way, in words that came so shrinkingly through\r\nthe darkness that they hardly reached the ear bent low to catch them,\r\ncame Stephen's murmured thought:\r\n\r\n'Oh, if he only knew!  And I can't tell him; I can't! dare not!  I must\r\nnot.  How could I dishonour him by bearing myself towards him as to that\r\nother . . . worthless . . . !  Oh! the happy, happy girls, who have\r\nmothers . . . !'  All the muscles of her body seemed to shrink and\r\ncollapse, till she was like an inert mass at the Silver Lady's feet.\r\n\r\nBut the other understood!\r\n\r\n After a long, long pause; when Stephen's sobbing had died away; when\r\neach muscle of her body had become rigid on its return to normal calm;\r\nthe Silver Lady began to talk of other matters, and conversation became\r\nnormal.  Stephen's courage seemed somehow to be restored, and she talked\r\nbrightly.\r\n\r\nBefore they parted the Silver Lady made a request.  She said in her\r\nnatural voice:\r\n\r\n'Couldst thou bring that gallant man who saved so many lives, and to whom\r\nthe Lord was so good in the restoration of his sight, to see me?  Thou\r\nknowest I have made a resolution not to go forth from this calm place\r\nwhilst I may remain.  But I should like to see him before he returns to\r\nthat far North where he has done such wonders.  He is evidently a man of\r\nkind heart; perhaps he will not mind coming to see a lonely woman who is\r\nno longer young.  There is much I should like to ask him of that land of\r\nwhich nothing was known in my own youth.  Perhaps he will not mind seeing\r\nme alone.'  Stephen's heart beat furiously.  She felt suffocating with\r\nnew hope, for what could be but good from Harold's meeting with that\r\nsweet woman who had already brought so much comfort into her own life?\r\nShe was abashed, and yet radiant; she seemed to tread on air as she stood\r\nbeside her friend saying farewell.  She did not wish to speak.  So the\r\ntwo women kissed and parted.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that two days hence the Stonehouse party were to\r\nspend the day at Lannoy, coming before lunch and staying the night, as\r\nthey wanted in the afternoon to return a visit at some distance to the\r\nnorth of Lannoy.  Harold was to ride over with them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Varilands party arrived, Stephen told them of Sister Ruth's wish\r\nto see Harold.  Pearl at once proffered a request that she also should be\r\ntaken at some other time to see the Silver Lady.  Harold acquiesced\r\nheartily; and it was agreed that some time in the late afternoon he\r\nshould pay the visit.  Stephen would bring him.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, she felt no awkwardness, no trepidation, as they rode\r\nup the steep road to the Mill.\r\n\r\nWhen the introduction had been effected, and half an hour had been\r\nconsumed in conventional small talk, Stephen, obedience to a look from\r\nthe Silver Lady, rose.  She said in they most natural way she could:\r\n\r\n'Now Sister Ruth, I will leave you two alone, if you do not mind.  Harold\r\ncan tell you all you want to know about Alaska; and perhaps, if you are\r\nvery good, he will tell some of his adventures!  Good afternoon, dear.  I\r\nwish you were to be with us to-night; but I know your rule.  I go for my\r\nride.  Sultan has had no exercise for five days; and he looked at me\r\nquite reproachfully when we met this morning.  Au revoir, Harold.  We\r\nshall meet at dinner!'\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone Harold came back from the door, and stood in the window\r\nlooking east.  The Silver Lady came and stood beside him.  She did not\r\nseem to notice his face, but in the mysterious way of women she watched\r\nhim keenly.  She wished to satisfy her own mind before she undertook her\r\nself-appointed task.\r\n\r\n Her eyes were turned towards the headland towards which Stephen on her\r\nwhite Arab was galloping at breakneck speed.  He was too good a horseman\r\nhimself, and he knew her prowess on horseback too well to have any\r\nanxiety regarding such a rider at Stephen.  It was not fear, then, that\r\nmade his face so white, and his eyes to have such an illimitable sadness.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Lady made up her mind.  All her instincts were to trust him.\r\nShe recognised a noble nature, with which truth would be her surest\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n'Come,' she said, 'sit here, friend; where another friend has often sat\r\nwith me.  From this you can see all the coastline, and all that thou\r\nwilt!'  Harold put a chair beside the one she pointed out; and when she\r\nwas seated he sat also.  She began at once with a desperate courage:\r\n\r\n'I have wanted much to see thee.  I have heard much of thee, before thy\r\ncoming.'  There was something in the tone of her voice which arrested his\r\nattention, and he looked keenly at her.  Here, in the full light, her\r\nface looked sadly white and he noticed that her lips trembled.  He said\r\nwith all the kindliness of his nature, for from the first moment he had\r\nseen her he had taken to her, her purity and earnestness and sweetness\r\nappealing to some aspiration within him:\r\n\r\n'You are pale!  I fear you are not well!  May I call your maid?  Can I do\r\nanything for you?'  She waved her hand gently:\r\n\r\n'Nay!  It is nothing.  It is but the result of a sleepless night and much\r\nthought.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!  I wish I had known!  I could have put off my visit; and I could\r\nhave come any other time to suit you.'  She smiled gently:\r\n\r\n'I fear that would have availed but little.  It was of thy coming that I\r\nwas concerned.'  Seeing his look of amazement, she went on quickly, her\r\nvoice becoming more steady as she lost sight of herself in her task:\r\n\r\n'Be patient a little with me.  I am an old woman; and until recently it\r\nhas been many and many years since the calm which I sought here has been\r\nruffled.  I had come to believe that for me earthly troubles were no\r\nmore.  But there has come into my life a new concern.  I have heard so\r\nmuch of thee, and before thy coming.'  The recurrence of the phrase\r\nstruck him.  He would have asked how such could be, but he deemed it\r\nbetter to wait.  She went on:\r\n\r\n'I have been wishful to ask thy advice.  But why should not I tell thee\r\noutright that which troubles me?  I am not used, at least for these many\r\nyears, to dissemble.  I can but trust thee in all; and lean on thy man's\r\nmercy to understand, and to aid me!'\r\n\r\n'I shall do all in my power, believe me!' said Harold simply.  'Speak\r\nfreely!'  She pointed out of the window, where Stephen's white horse\r\nseemed on the mighty sweep of green sward like a little dot.\r\n\r\n'It is of her that I would speak to thee!'  Harold's heart began to beat\r\nhard; he felt that something was coming.  The Silver Lady went on:\r\n\r\n'Why thinkest thou that she rideth at such speed?  It is her habit!'  He\r\nwaited.  She continued:\r\n\r\n'Doth it not seem to thee that such reckless movement is the result of\r\nmuch trouble; that she seeketh forgetfulness?'  He knew that she was\r\nspeaking truly; and somehow the conviction was borne upon him that she\r\nknew his secret heart, and was appealing to it.  If it was about Stephen!\r\nIf her disquiet was about her; then God bless her!  He would be patient\r\nand grateful.  The Quaker's voice seemed to come through his thought, as\r\nthough she had continued speaking whilst he had paused:\r\n\r\n'We have all our own secrets.  I have had mine; and I doubt not that thou\r\nhast had, may still have, thine own.  Stephen hath hers!  May I speak to\r\nthee of her?'\r\n\r\n'I shall be proud!  Oh! madam, I thank you with all my heart for your\r\nsweet kindness to her.  I cannot say what I feel; for she has always been\r\nvery dear to me!'  In the pause before she spoke again the beating of his\r\nown heart seemed to re-echo the quick sounds of Stephen's galloping\r\nhorse.  He was surprised at the method of her speech when it did come;\r\nfor she forgot her Quaker idiom, and spoke in the phrasing of her youth:\r\n\r\n'Do you love her still?'\r\n\r\n'With all my soul!  More than ever!'\r\n\r\n'Then, God be thanked; for it is in your power to do much good.  To\r\nrescue a poor, human, grieving soul from despair!'  Her words conveyed\r\njoy greater than she knew.  Harold did not himself know why the air\r\nseemed filled with sounds that seemed to answer every doubt of his life.\r\nHe felt, understood, with that understanding which is quicker than\r\nthought.  The Silver Lady went on now with a rush:\r\n\r\n'See, I have trusted you indeed!  I have given away another woman's\r\nsecret; but I do it without fear.  I can see that you also are troubled;\r\nand when I look back on my own life and remember the trouble that sent me\r\nout of the world; a lonely recluse here in this spot far from the stress\r\nof life, I rejoice that any act of mine can save such another tragedy as\r\nmy own.  I see that I need not go into detail.  You know that I am\r\nspeaking truth.  It was before you came so heroically on this new scene\r\nthat she told me her secret.  At a time when nothing was known of you\r\nexcept that you had disappeared.  When she laid bare her poor bleeding\r\nheart to me, she did it in such wise that for an instant I feared that it\r\nwas a murder which she had committed.  Indeed, she called it so!  You\r\nunderstand that I know all your secret; all her part in it at least.  And\r\nI know that you understand what loving duty lies before you.  I see it in\r\nyour eyes; your brave, true eyes!  Go! and the Lord be with thee!'  Her\r\naccustomed idiom had returned with prayer.  She turned her head away,\r\nand, standing up, leaned against the window.  Bending over, he took her\r\nhand and said simply:\r\n\r\n'God bless you!  I shall come back to thank you either to-night or to-\r\nmorrow; and I hope that she will be with me.'\r\n\r\nHe went quickly out of the room.  The woman stood for long looking out of\r\nthe window, and following with tear-dimmed eyes the movement of his great\r\nblack horse as he swept across country straight as the crow flies,\r\ntowards the headland whither Stephen had gone.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nStephen passed over the wide expanse without thought; certainly without\r\nmemory of it.  Never in her after-life could she recall any thought that\r\nhad passed through her mind from the time she left the open gate of the\r\nwindmill yard till she pulled up her smoking, panting horse beside the\r\nruin of the fisher's house.\r\n\r\nStephen was not unhappy!  She was not happy in any conscious form.  She\r\nwas satisfied rather than dissatisfied.  She was a woman!  A woman who\r\nwaited the coming of a man!\r\n\r\nFor a while she stood at the edge of the cliff, and looked at the turmoil\r\nof the tide churning on the rocks below.  Her heart went out in a great\r\nburst of thankfulness that it was her hand which had been privileged to\r\naid in rescuing so dear a life.  Then she looked around her.  Ostensibly\r\nit was to survey the ruined house; but in reality to search, even then\r\nunder her lashes, the whole green expanse sloping up to the windmill for\r\nsome moving figure.  She saw that which made her throat swell and her\r\nears to hear celestial music.  But she would not allow herself to think,\r\nof that at all events.  She was all woman now; all-patient, and\r\nall-submissive.  She waited the man; and the man was coming!\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes she walked round the house as though looking at it\r\ncritically for some after-purpose.  After the wreck Stephen had suggested\r\nto Trinity House that there should be a lighthouse on the point; and\r\noffered to bear the expense of building it.  She was awaiting the answer\r\nof the Brethren; and of course nothing would be done in clearing the\r\nground for any purpose till the answer had come.  She felt now that if\r\nthat reply was negative, she would herself build there a pleasure-house\r\nof her own.\r\n\r\nThen she went to the edge of the cliff, and went down the zigzag by which\r\nthe man and horse had gone to their gallant task.  At the edge of the\r\nflat rock she sat and thought.\r\n\r\nAnd through all her thoughts passed the rider who even now was thundering\r\nover the green sward on his way to her.  In her fancy at first, and later\r\nin her ears, she could hear the sound of his sweeping gallop.\r\n\r\n It was thus that a man should come to a woman!\r\n\r\nShe had no doubts now.  Her quietude was a hymn of grateful praise!\r\n\r\nThe sound stopped.  With all her ears she listened, her heart now\r\nbeginning to beat furiously.  The sea before her, all lines and furrows\r\nwith the passing tide, was dark under the shadow of the cliff; and the\r\nedge of the shadow was marked with the golden hue of sunset.\r\n\r\nAnd then she saw suddenly a pillar of shadow beyond the line of the\r\ncliff.  It rested but a moment, moved swiftly along the edge, and then\r\nwas lost to her eyes.\r\n\r\nBut to another sense there was greater comfort: she heard the clatter of\r\nrolling pebbles and the scramble of eager feet.  Harold was hastening\r\ndown the zigzag.\r\n\r\nOh! the music of that sound!  It woke all the finer instincts of the\r\nwoman.  All the dross and thought of self passed away.  Nature, sweet and\r\nsimple and true, reigned alone.  Instinctively she rose and came towards\r\nhim.  In the simple nobility of her self-surrender and her purpose, which\r\nwere at one with the grandeur of nature around her, to be negative was to\r\nbe false.\r\n\r\nSince he had spoken with the Silver Lady Harold had swept through the\r\nair; the rush of his foaming horse over the sward had been but a slow\r\nphysical progress, which mocked the on-sweep of his mind.  In is rapid\r\nride he too had been finding himself.  By the reading of his own soul he\r\nknew now that love needs a voice; that a man's love, to be welcomed to\r\nthe full, should be dominant and self-believing.\r\n\r\nWhen the two saw each other's eyes there was no need for words.  Harold\r\ncame close, opening wide his arms, Stephen flew to them.\r\n\r\nIn that divine moment, when their mouths met, both knew that their souls\r\nwere one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Paragraphs":["***START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAN***\n\n\n\nTranscribed from the 1897 Robert Hayes edition by David Price, email\nccx074@pglaf.org\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN\n\n\nBY\nBRAM STOKER\n\nAUTHOR OF \"DRACULA,\" ETC.\n\nLONDON: ROBERT HAYES, LTD.\nSIXTY-ONE FLEET STREET, E.C.\n\nCopyright, 1897, in the United States of America, according to Act of\nCongress, by Bram Stoker.\n\n[_All rights reserved_]\n\n\n\n\nFORE-GLIMPSE\n\n\n'I would rather be an angel than God!'\n\nThe voice of the speaker sounded clearly through the hawthorn tree.  The\nyoung man and the young girl who sat together on the low tombstone looked\r\nat each other.  They had heard the voices of the two children talking,\nbut had not noticed what they said; it was the sentiment, not the sound,\nwhich roused their attention.\n\nThe girl put her finger to her lips to impress silence, and the man\nnodded; they sat as still as mice whilst the two children went on\ntalking.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe scene would have gladdened a painter's heart.  An old churchyard.  The\nchurch low and square-towered, with long mullioned windows, the yellow-\ngrey stone roughened by age and tender-hued with lichens.  Round it\r\nclustered many tombstones tilted in all directions.  Behind the church a\nline of gnarled and twisted yews.\n\nThe churchyard was full of fine trees.  On one side a magnificent cedar;\non the other a great copper beech.  Here and there among the tombs and\nheadstones many beautiful blossoming trees rose from the long green\ngrass.  The laburnum glowed in the June afternoon sunlight; the lilac,\nthe hawthorn and the clustering meadowsweet which fringed the edge of the\nlazy stream mingled their heavy sweetness in sleepy fragrance.  The\r\nyellow-grey crumbling walls were green in places with wrinkled\nharts-tongues, and were topped with sweet-williams and spreading house-\nleek and stone-crop and wild-flowers whose delicious sweetness made for\nthe drowsy repose of perfect summer.\n\nBut amid all that mass of glowing colour the two young figures seated on\nthe grey old tomb stood out conspicuously.  The man was in conventional\nhunting-dress: red coat, white stock, black hat, white breeches, and top-\nboots.  The girl was one of the richest, most glowing, and yet withal","daintiest figures the eye of man could linger on.  She was in\nriding-habit of hunting scarlet cloth; her black hat was tipped forward\nby piled-up masses red-golden hair.  Round her neck was a white lawn\nscarf in the fashion of a man's hunting-stock, close fitting, and sinking\ninto a gold-buttoned waistcoat of snowy twill.  As she sat with the long\nskirt across her left arm her tiny black top-boots appeared underneath.\nHer gauntleted gloves were of white buckskin; her riding-whip was plaited\nof white leather, topped with ivory and banded with gold.\r\nEven in her fourteenth year Miss Stephen Norman gave promise of striking\nbeauty; beauty of a rarely composite character.  In her the various\nelements of her race seemed to have cropped out.  The firm-set jaw, with\nchin broader and more square than is usual in a woman, and the wide fine\nforehead and aquiline nose marked the high descent from Saxon through\nNorman.  The glorious mass of red hair, of the true flame colour, showed\nthe blood of another ancient ancestor of Northern race, and suited well\nwith the voluptuous curves of the full, crimson lips.  The purple-black\r\neyes, the raven eyebrows and eyelashes, and the fine curve of the\nnostrils spoke of the Eastern blood of the far-back wife of the Crusader.\nAlready she was tall for her age, with something of that lankiness which\nmarks the early development of a really fine figure.  Long-legged, long-\nnecked, as straight as a lance, with head poised on the proud neck like a\nlily on its stem.\n\nStephen Norman certainly gave promise of a splendid womanhood.  Pride,\nself-reliance and dominance were marked in every feature; in her bearing\nand in her lightest movement.\r\nHer companion, Harold An Wolf, was some five years her senior, and by\nmeans of those five years and certain qualities had long stood in the\nposition of her mentor.  He was more than six feet two in height, deep-\nchested, broad-shouldered, lean-flanked, long-armed and big-handed.  He\nhad that appearance strength, with well-poised neck and forward set of\nthe head, which marks the successful athlete.\n\nThe two sat quiet, listening.  Through the quiet hum of afternoon came\nthe voices of the two children.  Outside the lich-gate, under the shade","of the spreading cedar, the horses stamped occasionally as the flies\ntroubled them.  The grooms were mounted; one held the delicate-limbed\nwhite Arab, the other the great black horse.\n\n'I would rather be an angel than God!'\n\nThe little girl who made the remark was an ideal specimen of the village\nSunday-school child.  Blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked, thick-legged, with her\nstraight brown hair tied into a hard bunch with a much-creased, cherry-\ncoloured ribbon.  A glance at the girl would have satisfied the most\nsceptical as to her goodness.  Without being in any way smug she was\r\nradiant with self-satisfaction and well-doing.  A child of the people; an\nearly riser; a help to her mother; a good angel to her father; a little\nmother to her brothers and sisters; cleanly in mind and body;\nself-reliant, full of faith, cheerful.\n\nThe other little girl was prettier, but of a more stubborn type; more\npassionate, less organised, and infinitely more assertive.  Black-haired,\nblack-eyed, swarthy, large-mouthed, snub-nosed; the very type and essence\nof unrestrained, impulsive, emotional, sensual nature.  A seeing eye\r\nwould have noted inevitable danger for the early years of her womanhood.\nShe seemed amazed by the self-abnegation implied by her companion's\nstatement; after a pause she replied:\n\n'I wouldn't!  I'd rather be up at the top of everything and give orders\nto the angels if I chose.  I can't think, Marjorie, why you'd rather take\norders than give them.'\n\n'That's just it, Susan.  I don't want to give orders; I'd rather obey\nthem.  It must be very terrible to have to think of things so much, that\nyou want everything done your own way.  And besides, I shouldn't like to\r\nhave to be just!'\n\n'Why not?' the voice was truculent, though there was wistfulness in it\nalso.\n\n'Oh Susan.  Just fancy having to punish; for of course justice needs\npunishing as well as praising.  Now an angel has such a nice time,\nhelping people and comforting them, and bringing sunshine into dark\nplaces.  Putting down fresh dew every morning; making the flowers grow,\nand bringing babies and taking care of them till their mothers find them.\nOf course God is very good and very sweet and very merciful, but oh, He\nmust be very terrible.'","'All the same I would rather be God and able to do things!'\n\nThen the children moved off out of earshot.  The two seated on the\ntombstone looked after them.  The first to speak was the girl, who said:\n\n'That's very sweet and good of Marjorie; but do you know, Harold, I like\nSusie's idea better.'\n\n'Which idea was that, Stephen?'\n\n'Why, didn't you notice what she said: \"I'd like to be God and be able to\ndo things\"?'\n\n'Yes,' he said after a moment's reflection.  'That's a fine idea in the\nabstract; but I doubt of its happiness in the long-run.'\r\n'Doubt of its happiness?  Come now? what could there be better, after\nall?  Isn't it good enough to be God?  What more do you want?'\n\nThe girl's tone was quizzical, but her great black eyes blazed with some\nthought of sincerity which lay behind the fun.  The young man shook his\nhead with a smile of kindly tolerance as he answered:\n\n'It isn't that--surely you must know it.  I'm ambitious enough, goodness\nknows; but there are bounds to satisfy even me.  But I'm not sure that\nthe good little thing isn't right.  She seemed, somehow, to hit a bigger\r\ntruth than she knew: \"fancy having to be just.\"'\n\n'I don't see much difficulty in that.  Anyone can be just!'\n\n'Pardon me,' he answered, 'there is perhaps nothing so difficult in the\nwhole range of a man's work.'  There was distinct defiance in the girl's\neyes as she asked:\n\n'A man's work!  Why a man's work?  Isn't it a woman's work also?'\n\n'Well, I suppose it ought to be, theoretically; practically it isn't.'\n\n'And why not, pray?'  The mere suggestion of any disability of woman as\nsuch aroused immediate antagonism.  Her companion suppressed a smile as\r\nhe answered deliberately:\n\n'Because, my dear Stephen, the Almighty has ordained that justice is not\na virtue women can practise.  Mind, I do not say women are unjust.  Far\nfrom it, where there are no interests of those dear to them they can be\nof a sincerity of justice that can make a man's blood run cold.  But\njustice in the abstract is not an ordinary virtue: it has to be\nconsiderate as well as stern, and above all interest of all kinds and of\nevery one--'  The girl interrupted hotly:\n\n'I don't agree with you at all.  You can't give an instance where women","are unjust.  I don't mean of course individual instances, but classes of\ncases where injustice is habitual.'  The suppressed smile cropped out now\nunconsciously round the man's lips in a way which was intensely\naggravating to the girl.\n\n'I'll give you a few,' he said.  'Did you ever know a mother just to a\nboy who beat her own boy at school?'  The girl replied quietly:\n\n'Ill-treatment and bullying are subjects for punishment, not justice.'\n\n'Oh, I don't mean that kind of beating.  I mean getting the prizes their\nown boys contended for; getting above them in class; showing superior\r\npowers in running or cricket or swimming, or in any of the forms of\neffort in which boys vie with each other.'  The girl reflected, then she\nspoke:\n\n'Well, you may be right.  I don't altogether admit it, but I accept it as\nnot on my side.  But this is only one case.'\n\n'A pretty common one.  Do you think that Sheriff of Galway, who in\ndefault of a hangman hanged his son with his own hands, would have done\nso if he had been a woman?'  The girl answered at once:\n\n'Frankly, no.  I don't suppose the mother was ever born who would do such\r\na thing.  But that is not a common case, is it?  Have you any other?'  The\nyoung man paused before he spoke:\n\n'There is another, but I don't think I can go into it fairly with you.'\n\n'Why not?'\n\n'Well, because after all you know, Stephen, you are only a girl and you\ncan't be expected to know.'  The girl laughed:\n\n'Well, if it's anything about women surely a girl, even of my tender age,\nmust know something more of it, or be able to guess at, than any young\nman can.  However, say what you think and I'll tell you frankly if I\r\nagree--that is if a woman can be just, in such a matter.'\n\n'Shortly the point is this: Can a woman be just to another woman, or to a\nman for the matter of that, where either her own affection or a fault of\nthe other is concerned?'\n\n'I don't see any reason to the contrary.  Surely pride alone should\nensure justice in the former case, and the consciousness of superiority\nin the other.'  The young man shook his head:\n\n'Pride and the consciousness of superiority!  Are they not much the same\nthing.  But whether or no, if either of them has to be relied on, I'm","afraid the scales of Justice would want regulating, and her sword should\nbe blunted in case its edge should be turned back on herself.  I have an\nidea that although pride might be a guiding principle with you\nindividually, it would be a failure with the average.  However, as it\nwould be in any case a rule subject to many exceptions I must let it go.'\n\nHarold looked at his watch and rose.  Stephen followed him; transferring\nher whip into the hand which held up the skirt, she took his arm with her\r\nright hand in the pretty way in which a young girl clings to her elders.\nTogether they went out at the lich-gate.  The groom drew over with the\nhorses.  Stephen patted hers and gave her a lump of sugar.  Then putting\nher foot into Harold's ready hand she sprang lightly into the saddle.\nHarold swung himself into his saddle with the dexterity of an\naccomplished rider.\n\nAs the two rode up the road, keeping on the shady side under the trees,\nStephen said quietly, half to herself, as if the sentence had impressed\nitself on her mind:\n\n'To be God and able to do things!'\r\nHarold rode on in silence.  The chill of some vague fear was upon him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--STEPHEN\n\n\nStephen Norman of Normanstand had remained a bachelor until close on\nmiddle age, when the fact took hold of him that there was no immediate\nheir to his great estate.  Whereupon, with his wonted decision, he set\nabout looking for a wife.\n\nHe had been a close friend of his next neighbour, Squire Rowly, ever\nsince their college days.  They had, of course, been often in each\nother's houses, and Rowly's young sister--almost a generation younger\r\nthan himself, and the sole fruit of his father's second marriage--had\nbeen like a little sister to him too.  She had, in the twenty years which\nhad elapsed, grown to be a sweet and beautiful young woman.  In all the\npast years, with the constant opportunity which friendship gave of close\ncompanionship, the feeling never altered.  Squire Norman would have been\nsurprised had he been asked to describe Margaret Rowly and found himself\ncompelled to present the picture of a woman, not a child.\n\nNow, however, when his thoughts went womanward and wifeward, he awoke to","the fact that Margaret came within the category of those he sought.  His\nusual decision ran its course.  Semi-brotherly feeling gave place to a\nstronger and perhaps more selfish feeling.  Before he even knew it, he\nwas head over ears in love with his pretty neighbour.\n\nNorman was a fine man, stalwart and handsome; his forty years sat so\nlightly on him that his age never seemed to come into question in a\nwoman's mind.  Margaret had always liked him and trusted him; he was the\nbig brother who had no duty in the way of scolding to do.  His presence\r\nhad always been a gladness; and the sex of the girl, first unconsciously\nthen consciously, answered to the man's overtures, and her consent was\nsoon obtained.\n\nWhen in the fulness of time it was known that an heir was expected,\nSquire Norman took for granted that the child would be a boy, and held\nthe idea so tenaciously that his wife, who loved him deeply, gave up\nwarning and remonstrance after she had once tried to caution him against\ntoo fond a hope.  She saw how bitterly he would be disappointed in case\r\nit should prove to be a girl.  He was, however, so fixed on the point\nthat she determined to say no more.  After all, it might be a boy; the\nchances were equal.  The Squire would not listen to any one else at all;\nso as the time went on his idea was more firmly fixed than ever.  His\narrangements were made on the base that he would have a son.  The name\nwas of course decided.  Stephen had been the name of all the Squires of\nNormanstand for ages--as far back as the records went; and Stephen the\nnew heir of course would be.\n\nLike all middle-aged men with young wives he was supremely anxious as the\r\ntime drew near.  In his anxiety for his wife his belief in the son became\npassive rather than active.  Indeed, the idea of a son was so deeply\nfixed in his mind that it was not disturbed even by his anxiety for the\nyoung wife he idolised.\n\nWhen instead of a son a daughter was born, the Doctor and the nurse, who\nknew his views on the subject, held back from the mother for a little the\nknowledge of the sex.  Dame Norman was so weak that the Doctor feared\nlest anxiety as to how her husband would bear the disappointment, might","militate against her.  Therefore the Doctor sought the Squire in his\nstudy, and went resolutely at his task.\n\n'Well, Squire, I congratulate you on the birth of your child!'  Norman\nwas of course struck with the use of the word 'child'; but the cause of\nhis anxiety was manifested by his first question:\n\n'How is she, Doctor?  Is she safe?'  The child was after all of secondary\nimportance!  The Doctor breathed more freely; the question had lightened\nhis task.  There was, therefore, more assurance in his voice as he\nanswered:\r\n'She is safely through the worst of her trouble, but I am greatly anxious\nyet.  She is very weak.  I fear anything that might upset her.'\n\nThe Squire's voice came quick and strong:\n\n'There must be no upset!  And now tell me about my son?'  He spoke the\nlast word half with pride, half bashfully.\n\n'Your son is a daughter!'  There was silence for so long that the Doctor\nbegan to be anxious.  Squire Norman sat quite still; his right hand\nresting on the writing-table before him became clenched so hard that the\nknuckles looked white and the veins red.  After a long slow breath he\r\nspoke:\n\n'She, my daughter, is well?'  The Doctor answered with cheerful alacrity:\n\n'Splendid!--I never saw a finer child in my life.  She will be a comfort\nand an honour to you!'  The Squire spoke again:\n\n'What does her mother think?  I suppose she's very proud of her?'\n\n'She does not know yet that it is a girl.  I thought it better not to let\nher know till I had told you.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Because--because--Norman, old friend, you know why!  Because you had set\nyour heart on a son; and I know how it would grieve that sweet young wife\r\nand mother to feel your disappointment.  I want your lips to be the first\nto tell her; so that on may assure her of your happiness in that a\ndaughter has been born to you.'\n\nThe Squire put out his great hand and laid it on the other's shoulder.\nThere was almost a break in his voice as he said:\n\n'Thank you, my old friend, my true friend, for your thought.  When may I\nsee her?'\n\n'By right, not yet.  But, as knowing your views, she may fret herself\ntill she knows, I think you had better come at once.'\n\nAll Norman's love and strength combined for his task.  As he leant over","and kissed his young wife there was real fervour in his voice as he said:\n\n'Where is my dear daughter that you may place her in my arms?'  For an\ninstant there came a chill to the mother's heart that her hopes had been\nso far disappointed; but then came the reaction of her joy that her\nhusband, her baby's father, was pleased.  There was a heavenly dawn of\nred on her pale face as she drew her husband's head down and kissed him.\n\n'Oh, my dear,' she said, 'I am so happy that you are pleased!'  The nurse\ntook the mother's hand gently and held it to the baby as she laid it in\r\nthe father's arms.\n\nHe held the mother's hand as he kissed the baby's brow.\n\nThe Doctor touched him gently on the arm and beckoned him away.  He went\nwith careful footsteps, looking behind as he went.\n\nAfter dinner he talked with the Doctor on various matters; but presently\nhe asked:\n\n'I suppose, Doctor, it is no sort of rule that the first child regulates\nthe sex of a family?'\n\n'No, of course not.  Otherwise how should we see boys and girls mixed in\none family, as is nearly always the case.  But, my friend,' he went on,\r\n'you must not build hopes so far away.  I have to tell you that your wife\nis far from strong.  Even now she is not so well as I could wish, and\nthere yet may be change.'  The Squire leaped impetuously to his feet as\nhe spoke quickly:\n\n'Then why are we waiting here?  Can nothing be done?  Let us have the\nbest help, the best advice in the world.'  The Doctor raised his hand.\n\n'Nothing can be done as yet.  I have only fear.'\n\n'Then let us be ready in case your fears should be justified!  Who are\nthe best men in London to help in such a case?'  The Doctor mentioned two\r\nnames; and within a few minutes a mounted messenger was galloping to\nNorcester, the nearest telegraph centre.  The messenger was to arrange\nfor a special train if necessary.  Shortly afterwards the Doctor went\nagain to see his patient.  After a long absence he came back, pale and\nagitated.  Norman felt his heart sink when he saw him; a groan broke from\nhim as the Doctor spoke:\n\n'She is much worse!  I am in great fear that she may pass away before the\nmorning!'  The Squire's strong voice was clouded, with a hoarse veil as\nhe asked:","'May I see her?'\n\n'Not yet; at present she is sleeping.  She may wake strengthened; in\nwhich case you may see her.  But if not--'\n\n'If not?'--the voice was not like his own.\n\n'Then I shall send for you at once!'  The Doctor returned to his vigil.\nThe Squire, left alone, sank on his knees, his face in his hands; his\ngreat shoulders shook with the intensity of his grief.\n\nAn hour or more passed before he heard hurried steps.  He sprang to the\ndoor:\n\n'Well?'\n\n'You had better come now.'\n\n'Is she better?'\n\n'Alas! no.  I fear her minutes are numbered.  School yourself, my dear\r\nold friend!  God will help you in this bitter hour.  All you can do now\nis to make her last moments happy.'\n\n'I know!  I know!' he answered in a voice so calm that his companion\nwondered.\n\nWhen they came into the room Margaret was dozing.  When her eyes opened\nand she found her husband beside her bed there spread over her face a\nglad look; which, alas! soon changed to one of pain.  She motioned to him\nto bend down.  He knelt and put his head beside her on the pillow; his\narms went tenderly round her as though by his iron devotion and strength\r\nhe would shield her from all harm.  Her voice came very low and in broken\ngasps; she was summoning all her strength that she might speak:\n\n'My dear, dear husband, I am so sad at leaving you!  You have made me so\nhappy, and I love you so!  Forgive me, dear, for the pain I know you will\nsuffer when I am gone!  And oh, Stephen, I know you will cherish our\nlittle one--yours and mine--when I am gone.  She will have no mother; you\nwill have to be father and mother too.'\n\n'I will hold her in my very heart's core, my darling, as I hold you!'  He\r\ncould hardly speak from emotion.  She went on:\n\n'And oh, my dear, you will not grieve that she is not a son to carry on\nyour name?'  And then a sudden light came into her eyes; and there was\nexultation in her weak voice as she said:\n\n'She is to be our only one; let her be indeed our son!  Call her the name\nwe both love!'  For answer he rose and laid his hand very, very tenderly\non the babe as he said:\n\n'This dear one, my sweet wife, who will carry your soul in her breast,\nwill be my son; the only son I shall ever have.  All my life long I","shall, please Almighty God, so love her--our little Stephen--as you and I\nlove each other!'\n\nShe laid her hand on his so that it touched at once her husband and her\nchild.  Then she raised the other weak arm, and placed it round his neck,\nand their lips met.  Her soul went out in this last kiss.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--THE HEART OF A CHILD\n\n\nFor some weeks after his wife's death Squire Norman was overwhelmed with\ngrief.  He made a brave effort, however, to go through the routine of his\nlife; and succeeded so far that he preserved an external appearance of\r\nbearing his loss with resignation.  But within, all was desolation.\n\nLittle Stephen had winning ways which sent deep roots into her father's\nheart.  The little bundle of nerves which the father took into his arms\nmust have realised with all its senses that, in all that it saw and heard\nand touched, there was nothing but love and help and protection.\nGradually the trust was followed by expectation.  If by some chance the\nfather was late in coming to the nursery the child would grow impatient\nand cast persistent, longing glances at the door.  When he came all was\r\njoy.\n\nTime went quickly by, and Norman was only recalled to its passing by the\ngrowth of his child.  Seedtime and harvest, the many comings of nature's\ngrowth were such commonplaces to him, and had been for so many years,\nthat they made on him no impressions of comparison.  But his baby was one\nand one only.  Any change in it was not only in itself a new experience,\nbut brought into juxtaposition what is with what was.  The changes that\nbegan to mark the divergence of sex were positive shocks to him, for they\r\nwere unexpected.  In the very dawn of babyhood dress had no special\nimport; to his masculine eyes sex was lost in youth.  But, little by\nlittle, came the tiny changes which convention has established.  And with\neach change came to Squire Norman the growing realisation that his child\nwas a woman.  A tiny woman, it is true, and requiring more care and\nprotection and devotion than a bigger one; but still a woman.  The pretty\nlittle ways, the eager caresses, the graspings and holdings of the\nchildish hands, the little roguish smiles and pantings and flirtings were","all but repetitions in little of the dalliance of long ago.  The father,\nafter all, reads in the same book in which the lover found his knowledge.\n\nAt first there was through all his love for his child a certain\nresentment of her sex.  His old hope of a son had been rooted too deeply\nto give way easily.  But when the conviction came, and with it the habit\nof its acknowledgment, there came also a certain resignation, which is\nthe halting-place for satisfaction.  But he never, not then nor\nafterwards, quite lost the old belief that Stephen was indeed a son.\r\nCould there ever have been a doubt, the remembrance of his wife's eyes\nand of her faint voice, of her hope and her faith, as she placed her baby\nin his arms would have refused it a resting-place.  This belief tinged\nall his after-life and moulded his policy with regard to his girl's\nupbringing.  If she was to be indeed his son as well as his daughter, she\nmust from the first be accustomed to boyish as well as to girlish ways.\nThis, in that she was an only child, was not a difficult matter to\naccomplish.  Had she had brothers and sisters, matters of her sex would\r\nsoon have found their own level.\n\nThere was one person who objected strongly to any deviation from the\nconventional rule of a girl's education.  This was Miss Laetitia Rowly,\nwho took after a time, in so far as such a place could be taken, that of\nthe child's mother.  Laetitia Rowly was a young aunt of Squire Rowly of\nNorwood; the younger sister of his father and some sixteen years his own\nsenior.  When the old Squire's second wife had died, Laetitia, then a\nconceded spinster of thirty-six, had taken possession of the young\r\nMargaret.  When Margaret had married Squire Norman, Miss Rowly was well\nsatisfied; for she had known Stephen Norman all her life.  Though she\ncould have wished a younger bridegroom for her darling, she knew it would\nbe hard to get a better man or one of more suitable station in life.  Also\nshe knew that Margaret loved him, and the woman who had never found the\nhappiness of mutual love in her own life found a pleasure in the romance\nof true love, even when the wooer was middle-aged.  She had been\ntravelling in the Far East when the belated news of Margaret's death came","to her.  When she had arrived home she announced her intention of taking\ncare of Margaret's child, just as she had taken care of Margaret.  For\nseveral reasons this could not be done in the same way.  She was not old\nenough to go and live at Normanstand without exciting comment; and the\nSquire absolutely refused to allow that his daughter should live anywhere\nexcept in his own house.  Educational supervision, exercised at such\ndistance and so intermittently, could neither be complete nor exact.\n\nThough Stephen was a sweet child she was a wilful one, and very early in\r\nlife manifested a dominant nature.  This was a secret pleasure to her\nfather, who, never losing sight of his old idea that she was both son and\ndaughter, took pleasure as well as pride out of each manifestation of her\nimperial will.  The keen instinct of childhood, which reasons in feminine\nfashion, and is therefore doubly effective in a woman-child, early\ngrasped the possibilities of her own will.  She learned the measure of\nher nurse's foot and then of her father's; and so, knowing where lay the\nbounds of possibility of the achievement of her wishes, she at once\r\navoided trouble and learned how to make the most of the space within the\nlimit of her tether.\n\nIt is not those who 'cry for the Moon' who go furthest or get most in\nthis limited world of ours.  Stephen's pretty ways and unfailing good\ntemper were a perpetual joy to her father; and when he found that as a\nrule her desires were reasonable, his wish to yield to them became a\nhabit.\n\nMiss Rowly seldom saw any individual thing to disapprove of.  She it was\nwho selected the governesses and who interviewed them from time to time\r\nas to the child's progress.  Not often was there any complaint, for the\nlittle thing had such a pretty way of showing affection, and such a\nmanifest sense of justified trust in all whom she encountered, that it\nwould have been hard to name a specific fault.\n\nBut though all went in tears of affectionate regret, and with eminently\nsatisfactory emoluments and references, there came an irregularly timed\nsuccession of governesses.\n\nStephen's affection for her 'Auntie' was never affected by any of the\nchanges.  Others might come and go, but there no change came.  The","child's little hand would steal into one of the old lady's strong ones,\nor would clasp a finger and hold it tight.  And then the woman who had\nnever had a child of her own would feel, afresh each time, as though the\nchild's hand was gripping her heart.\n\nWith her father she was sweetest of all.  And as he seemed to be pleased\nwhen she did anything like a little boy, the habit of being like one\ninsensibly grew on her.\n\nAn only child has certain educational difficulties.  The true learning is\nnot that which we are taught, but that which we take in for ourselves\r\nfrom experience and observation, and children's experiences and\nobservation, especially of things other than repressive, are mainly of\nchildren.  The little ones teach each other.  Brothers and sisters are\nmore with each other than are ordinary playmates, and in the familiarity\nof their constant intercourse some of the great lessons, so useful in\nafter-life, are learned.  Little Stephen had no means of learning the\nwisdom of give-and-take.  To her everything was given, given bountifully\nand gracefully.  Graceful acceptance of good things came to her\r\nnaturally, as it does to one who is born to be a great lady.  The\nchildren of the farmers in the neighbourhood, with whom at times she\nplayed, were in such habitual awe of the great house, that they were\nseldom sufficiently at ease to play naturally.  Children cannot be on\nequal terms on special occasions with a person to whom they have been\ntaught to bow or courtesy as a public habit.  The children of\nneighbouring landowners, who were few and far between, and of the\nprofessional people in Norcester, were at such times as Stephen met them,\r\ngenerally so much on their good behaviour, that the spontaneity of play,\nthrough which it is that sharp corners of individuality are knocked off\nor worn down, did not exist.\n\nAnd so Stephen learned to read in the Book of Life; though only on one\nside of it.  At the age of six she had, though surrounded with loving\ncare and instructed by skilled teachers, learned only the accepting side\nof life.  Giving of course there was in plenty, for the traditions of\nNormanstand were royally benevolent; many a blessing followed the little","maid's footsteps as she accompanied some timely aid to the sick and needy\nsent from the Squire's house.  Moreover, her Aunt tried to inculcate\ncertain maxims founded on that noble one that it is more blessed to give\nthan to receive.  But of giving in its true sense: the giving that which\nwe want for ourselves, the giving that is as a temple built on the rock\nof self-sacrifice, she knew nothing.  Her sweet and spontaneous nature,\nwhich gave its love and sympathy so readily, was almost a bar to\neducation: it blinded the eyes that would have otherwise seen any defect\r\nthat wanted altering, any evil trait that needed repression, any lagging\nvirtue that required encouragement--or the spur.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--HAROLD\n\n\nSquire Norman had a clerical friend whose rectory of Carstone lay some\nthirty miles from Normanstand.  Thirty miles is not a great distance for\nrailway travel; but it is a long drive.  The days had not come, nor were\nthey ever likely to come, for the making of a railway between the two\nplaces.  For a good many years the two men had met in renewal of their\r\nold University days.  Squire Norman and Dr. An Wolf had been chums at\nTrinity, Cambridge, and the boyish friendship had ripened and lasted.\nWhen Harold An Wolf had put in his novitiate in a teeming Midland\nmanufacturing town, it was Norman's influence which obtained the\nrectorship for his friend.  It was not often that they could meet, for An\nWolf's work, which, though not very exacting, had to be done\nsingle-handed, kept him to his post.  Besides, he was a good scholar and\neked out a small income by preparing a few pupils for public school.  An\r\noccasional mid-week visit to Normanstand in the slack time of school work\non the Doctor's part, and now and again a drive by Norman over to the\nrectory, returning the next day, had been for a good many years the\nmeasure of their meeting.  Then An Wolf's marriage and the birth of a son\nhad kept him closer to home.  Mrs. An Wolf had been killed in a railway\naccident a couple of years after her only child had been born; and at the\ntime Norman had gone over to render any assistance in his power to the\nafflicted man, and to give him what was under the circumstances his best","gift, sympathy.  After an interval of a few years the Squire's courtship\nand marriage, at which his old friend had assisted, had confined his\nactivities to a narrower circle.  The last time they had met was when An\nWolf had come over to Norcester to aid in the burial of his friend's\nwife.  In the process of years, however, the shadow over Norman's life\nhad begun to soften; when his baby had grown to be something of a\ncompanion, they met again.  Norman, 'who had never since his wife's death\nbeen able to tear himself, even for a night, away from Normanstand and\r\nStephen, wrote to his old friend asking him to come to him.  An Wolf\ngladly promised, and for a week of growing expectation the Squire looked\nforward to their meeting.  Each found the other somewhat changed, in all\nbut their old affection.\n\nAn Wolf was delighted with the little Stephen.  Her dainty beauty seemed\nto charm him; and the child, seeming to realise what pleasure she was\ngiving, exercised all her little winning ways.  The rector, who knew more\nof children than did his, friend, told her as she sat on his knee of a\r\nvery interesting person: his own son.  The child listened, interested at\nfirst, then enraptured.  She asked all kinds of questions; and the\nfather's eyes brightened as he gladly answered the pretty sympathetic\nchild, already deep in his heart for her father's sake.  He told her\nabout the boy who was so big and strong, and who could run and leap and\nswim and play cricket and football better than any other boy with whom he\nplayed.  When, warmed himself by the keen interest of the little girl,\nand seeing her beautiful black eyes beginning to glow, he too woke to the\r\nglory of the time; and all the treasured moments of the father's lonely\nheart gave out their store.  And the other father, thrilled with delight\nbecause of his baby's joy with, underlying all, an added pleasure that\nthe little Stephen's interest was in sports that were for boys, looked on\napprovingly, now and again asking questions himself in furtherance of the\nchild's wishes.\n\nAll the afternoon they sat in the garden, close to the stream that came\nout of the rock, and An Wolf told father's tales of his only son.  Of the","great cricket match with Castra Puerorum when he had made a hundred not\nout.  Of the school races when he had won so many prizes.  Of the\nswimming match in the Islam River when, after he had won the race and had\ndressed himself, he went into the water in his clothes to help some\nchildren who had upset a boat.  How when Widow Norton's only son could\nnot be found, he dived into the deep hole of the intake of the milldam of\nthe great Carstone mills where Wingate the farrier had been drowned.  And\nhow, after diving twice without success, he had insisted on going down\r\nthe third time though people had tried to hold him back; and how he had\nbrought up in his arms the child all white and so near death that they\nhad to put him in the ashes of the baker's oven before he could be\nbrought back to life.\n\nWhen her nurse came to take her to bed, she slid down from her father's\nknee and coming over to Dr. An Wolf, gravely held out her hand and said:\n'Good-bye!'  Then she kissed him and said:\n\n'Thank you so much, Mr. Harold's daddy.  Won't you come soon again, and\ntell us more?'  Then she jumped again upon her father's knee and hugged\r\nhim round the neck and kissed him, and whispered in his ear:\n\n'Daddy, please make Mr. Harold's daddy when he comes again, bring Harold\nwith him!'\n\nAfter all it is natural for women to put the essence of the letter in the\npostscript!\n\nTwo weeks afterwards Dr. An Wolf came again and brought Harold with him.\nThe time had gone heavily with little Stephen when she knew that Harold\nwas coming with his father.  Stephen had been all afire to see the big\nboy whose feats had so much interested her, and for a whole week had\r\nflooded Mrs. Jarrold with questions which she was unable to answer.  At\nlast the time came and she went out to the hall door with her father to\nwelcome the guests.  At the top of the great granite steps, down which in\ntime of bad weather the white awning ran, she stood holding her father's\nhand and waving a welcome.\n\n'Good morning, Harold!  Good morning, Mr. Harold's daddy!'\n\nThe meeting was a great pleasure to both the children, and resulted in an\nimmediate friendship.  The small girl at once conceived a great\nadmiration for the big, strong boy nearly twice her age and more than","twice her size.  At her time of life the convenances are not, and love is\na thing to be spoken out at once and in the open.  Mrs. Jarrold, from the\nmoment she set eyes on him, liked the big kindly-faced boy who treated\nher like a lady, and who stood awkwardly blushing and silent in the\nmiddle of the nursery listening to the tiny child's proffers of\naffection.  For whatever kind of love it is that boys are capable of,\nHarold had fallen into it.  'Calf-love' is a thing habitually treated\nwith contempt.  It may be ridiculous; but all the same it is a serious\r\nreality--to the calf.\n\nHarold's new-found affection was as deep as his nature.  An only child\nwho had in his memory nothing of a mother's love, his naturally\naffectionate nature had in his childish days found no means of\nexpression.  A man child can hardly pour out his full heart to a man,\neven a father or a comrade; and this child had not, in a way, the\nconsolations of other children.  His father's secondary occupation of\nteaching brought other boys to the house and necessitated a domestic\nroutine which had to be exact.  There was no place for little girls in a\r\nboys' school; and though many of Dr. An Wolf's friends who were mothers\nmade much of the pretty, quiet boy, and took him to play with their\nchildren, he never seemed to get really intimate with them.  The equality\nof companionship was wanting.  Boys he knew, and with them he could hold\nhis own and yet be on affectionate terms.  But girls were strange to him,\nand in their presence he was shy.  With this lack of understanding of the\nother sex, grew up a sort of awe of it.  His opportunities of this kind\r\nof study were so few that the view never could become rectified.\n\nAnd so it was that from his boyhood up to his twelfth year, Harold's\nknowledge of girlhood never increased nor did his awe diminish.  When his\nfather had told him all about his visit to Normanstand and of the\ninvitation which had been extended to him there came first awe, then\ndoubt, then expectation.  Between Harold and his father there was love\nand trust and sympathy.   The father's married love so soon cut short\nfound expression towards his child; and between them there had never been","even the shadow of a cloud.  When his father told him how pretty the\nlittle Stephen was, how dainty, how sweet, he began to picture her in his\nmind's eye and to be bashfully excited over meeting her.\n\nHis first glimpse of Stephen was, he felt, one that he never could\nforget.  She had made up her mind that she would let Harold see what she\ncould do.  Harold could fly kites and swim and play cricket; she could\nnot do any of these, but she could ride.  Harold should see her pony, and\nsee her riding him all by herself.  And there would be another pony for\r\nHarold, a big, big, big one--she had spoken about its size herself to\nTopham, the stud-groom.  She had coaxed her daddy into promising that\nafter lunch she should take Harold riding.  To this end she had made\nready early.  She had insisted on putting on the red riding habit which\nDaddy had given her for her birthday, and now she stood on the top of the\nsteps all glorious in hunting pink, with the habit held over her arms,\nwith the tiny hunting-hoots all shiny underneath.  She had no hat on, and\nher beautiful hair of golden red shone in its glory.  But even it was\r\nalmost outshone by the joyous flush on her cheeks as she stood waving the\nlittle hand that did not hold Daddy's.  She was certainly a picture to\ndream of!  Her father's eyes lost nothing of her dainty beauty.  He was\nso proud of her that he almost forgot to wish that she had been a boy.\nThe pleasure he felt in her appearance was increased by the fact that her\ndress was his own idea.\n\nDuring luncheon Stephen was fairly silent; she usually chattered all\nthrough as freely as a bird sings.  Stephen was silent because the\r\noccasion was important.  Besides, Daddy wasn't all alone, and therefore\nhad not to be cheered up.  Also--this in postscript form--Harold was\nsilent!  In her present frame of mind Harold could do no wrong, and what\nHarold did was right.  She was unconsciously learning already a lesson\nfrom his presence.\n\nThat evening when going to bed she came to say good-night to Daddy.  After\nshe had kissed him she also kissed 'old Mr. Harold,' as she now called\nhim, and as a matter of course kissed Harold also.  He coloured up at\nonce.  It was the first time a girl had ever kissed him.","The next day from early morning until bed-time was one long joy to\nStephen, and there were few things of interest that Harold had not been\nshown; there were few of the little secrets which had not been shared\nwith him as they went about hand in hand.  Like all manly boys Harold was\ngood to little children and patient with them.  He was content to follow\nStephen about and obey all her behests.  He had fallen in love with her\nto the very bottom of his boyish heart.\n\nWhen the guests were going, Stephen stood with her father on the steps to\r\nsee them off.  When the carriage had swept behind the farthest point in\nthe long avenue, and when Harold's cap waving from the window could no\nlonger be seen, Squire Norman turned to go in, but paused in obedience to\nthe unconscious restraint of Stephen's hand.  He waited patiently till\nwith a long sigh she turned to him and they went in together.\n\nThat night before she went to bed Stephen came and sat on her father's\nknee, and after sundry pattings and kissings whispered in his ear:\n\n'Daddy, wouldn't it be nice if Harold could come here altogether?\r\nCouldn't you ask him to?  And old Mr. Harold could come too.  Oh, I wish\nhe was here!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--HAROLD AT NORMANSTAND\n\n\nTwo years afterwards a great blow fell upon Harold.  His father, who had\nbeen suffering from repeated attacks of influenza, was, when in the low\ncondition following this, seized with pneumonia, to which in a few days\nhe succumbed.  Harold was heart-broken.  The affection which had been\nbetween him and his father had been so consistent that he had never known\na time when it was not.\r\nWhen Squire Norman had returned to the house with him after the funeral,\nhe sat in silence holding the boy's hand till he had wept his heart out.\nBy this time the two were old friends, and the boy was not afraid or too\nshy to break down before him.  There was sufficient of the love of the\nold generation to begin with trust in the new.\n\nPresently, when the storm was past and Harold had become his own man\nagain, Norman said:\n\n'And now, Harold, I want you to listen to me.  You know, my dear boy,\nthat I am your father's oldest friend, and right sure I am that he would","approve of what I say.  You must come home with me to live.  I know that\nin his last hours the great concern of your dear father's heart would\nhave been for the future of his boy.  And I know, too, that it was a\ncomfort to him to feel that you and I are such friends, and that the son\nof my dearest old friend would be as a son to me.  We have been friends,\nyou and I, a long time, Harold; and we have learned to trust, and I hope\nto love, one another.  And you and my little Stephen are such friends\nalready that your coming into the house will be a joy to us all.  Why,\r\nlong ago, when first you came, she said to me the night you went away:\n\"Daddy, wouldn't it be nice if Harold could come here altogether?\"'\n\nAnd so Harold An Wolf came back with the Squire to Normanstand, and from\nthat day on became a member of his house, and as a son to him.  Stephen's\ndelight at his coming was of course largely qualified by her sympathy\nwith his grief; but it would have been hard to give him more comfort than\nshe did in her own pretty way.  Putting her lips to his she kissed him,\nand holding his big hand in both of her little ones, she whispered\r\nsoftly:\n\n'Poor Harold!  You and I should love each other, for we have both lost\nour mother.  And now you have lost your father.  But you must let my dear\ndaddy be yours too!'\n\nAt this time Harold was between fourteen and fifteen years old.  He was\nwell educated in so far as private teaching went.  His father had devoted\nmuch care to him, so that he was well grounded in all the Academic\nbranches of learning.  He was also, for his years, an expert in most\nmanly exercises.  He could ride anything, shoot straight, fence, run,\r\njump or swim with any boy more than his age and size.\n\nIn Normanstand his education was continued by the rector.  The Squire\nused often to take him with him when he went to ride, or fish, or shoot;\nfrankly telling him that as his daughter was, as yet, too young to be his\ncompanion in these matters, he would act as her locum tenens.  His living\nin the house and his helping as he did in Stephen's studies made\nfamiliarity perpetual.  He was just enough her senior to command her\nchildish obedience; and there were certain qualities in his nature which","were eminently calculated to win and keep the respect of women as well as\nof men.  He was the very incarnation of sincerity, and had now and again,\nin certain ways, a sublime self-negation which, at times, seemed in\nstartling contrast to a manifestly militant nature.  When at school he\nhad often been involved in fights which were nearly always on matters of\nprinciple, and by a sort of unconscious chivalry he was generally found\nfighting on the weaker side.  Harold's father had been very proud of his\nancestry, which was Gothic through the Dutch, as the manifestly corrupted\r\nprefix of the original name implied, and he had gathered from a constant\nstudy of the Sagas something of the philosophy which lay behind the ideas\nof the Vikings.\n\nThis new stage of Harold's life made for quicker development than any\nwhich had gone before.  Hitherto he had not the same sense of\nresponsibility.  To obey is in itself a relief; and as it is an actual\nconsolation to weak natures, so it is only a retarding of the strong.  Now\nhe had another individuality to think of.  There was in his own nature a\r\nvein of anxiety of which the subconsciousness of his own strength threw\nup the outcrop.\n\nLittle Stephen with the instinct of her sex discovered before long this\nweakness.  For it is a weakness when any quality can be assailed or used.\nThe using of a man's weakness is not always coquetry; but it is something\nvery like it.  Many a time the little girl, who looked up to and admired\nthe big boy who could compel her to anything when he was so minded,\nwould, for her own ends, work on his sense of responsibility, taking an\nelfin delight in his discomfiture.\r\nThe result of Stephen's harmless little coquetries was that Harold had\noccasionally either to thwart some little plan of daring, or else cover\nup its results.  In either case her confidence in him grew, so that\nbefore long he became an established fact in her life, a being in whose\npower and discretion and loyalty she had absolute, blind faith.  And this\nfeeling seemed to grow with her own growth.  Indeed at one time it came\nto be more than an ordinary faith.  It happened thus:\n\nThe old Church of St. Stephen, which was the parish church of","Normanstand, had a peculiar interest for the Norman family.  There,\neither within the existing walls or those which had preceded them when\nthe church was rebuilt by that Sir Stephen who was standard-bearer to\nHenry VI., were buried all the direct members of the line.  It was an\nunbroken record of the inheritors since the first Sir Stephen, who had\nhis place in the Domesday Book.  Without, in the churchyard close to the\nchurch, were buried all such of the collaterals as had died within hail\nof Norcester.  Some there were of course who, having achieved distinction\r\nin various walks of life, were further honoured by a resting-place within\nthe chancel.  The whole interior was full of records of the family.\nSquire Norman was fond of coming to the place; and often from the very\nbeginning had taken Stephen with him.  One of her earliest recollections\nwas kneeling down with her father, who held her hand in his, whilst with\nthe other he wiped the tears from his eyes, before a tomb sculptured\nbeautifully in snowy marble.  She never forgot the words he had said to\nher:\n\n'You will always remember, darling, that your dear mother rests in this\r\nsacred place.  When I am gone, if you are ever in any trouble come here.\nCome alone and open out your heart.  You need never fear to ask God for\nhelp at the grave of your mother!'  The child had been impressed, as had\nbeen many and many another of her race.  For seven hundred years each\nchild of the house of Norman had been brought alone by either parent and\nhad heard some such words.  The custom had come to be almost a family\nritual, and it never failed to leave its impress in greater or lesser\ndegree.\n\nWhenever Harold had in the early days paid a visit to Normanstand, the\r\nchurch had generally been an objective of their excursions.  He was\nalways delighted to go.  His love for his own ancestry made him admire\nand respect that of others; so that Stephen's enthusiasm in the matter\nwas but another cord to bind him to her.\n\nIn one of their excursions they found the door into the crypt open; and\nnothing would do Stephen but that they should enter it.  To-day, however,\nthey had no light; but they arranged that on the morrow they would bring\ncandles with them and explore the place thoroughly.  The afternoon of the","next day saw them at the door of the crypt with a candle, which Harold\nproceeded to light.  Stephen looked on admiringly, and said in a half-\nconscious way, the half-consciousness being shown in the implication:\n\n'You are not afraid of the crypt?'\n\n'Not a bit!  In my father's church there was a crypt, and I was in it\nseveral times.'  As he spoke the memory of the last time he had been\nthere swept over him.  He seemed to see again the many lights, held in\nhands that were never still, making a grim gloom where the black shadows\r\nwere not; to hear again the stamp and hurried shuffle of the many feet,\nas the great oak coffin was borne by the struggling mass of men down the\nsteep stairway and in through the narrow door . . . And then the hush\nwhen voices faded away; and the silence seemed a real thing, as for a\nwhile he stood alone close to the dead father who had been all in all to\nhim.  And once again he seemed to feel the recall to the living world of\nsorrow and of light, when his inert hand was taken in the strong loving\none of Squire Norman.\n\nHe paused and drew back.\r\n'Why don't you go on?' she asked, surprised.\n\nHe did not like to tell her then.  Somehow, it seemed out of place.  He\nhad often spoken to her of his father, and she had always been a\nsympathetic listener; but here, at the entrance of the grim vault, he did\nnot wish to pain her with his own thoughts of sorrow and all the terrible\nmemories which the similarity of the place evoked.  And even whilst he\nhesitated there came to him a thought so laden with pain and fear that he\nrejoiced at the pause which gave it to him in time.  It was in that very\r\ncrypt that Stephen's mother had been buried, and had they two gone in, as\nthey had intended, the girl might have seen her mother's coffin as he had\nseen his father's, but under circumstances which made him shiver.  He had\nbeen, as he said, often in the crypt at Carstone; and well he knew the\nsordidness of the chamber of death.  His imagination was alive as well as\nhis memory; he shuddered, not for himself, but for Stephen.  How could he\nallow the girl to suffer in such a way as she might, as she infallibly\nwould, if it were made apparent to her in such a brutal way?  How","pitiful, how meanly pitiful, is the aftermath of death.  Well he\nremembered how many a night he woke in an agony, thinking of how his\nfather lay in that cold, silent, dust-strewn vault, in the silence and\nthe dark, with never a ray of light or hope or love!  Gone, abandoned,\nforgotten by all, save perhaps one heart which bled . . . He would save\nlittle Stephen, if he could, from such a memory.  He would not give any\nreason for refusing to go in.\n\nHe blew out the candle, and turned the key in the lock, took it out, and\nput it in his pocket.\r\n'Come, Stephen!' he said, 'let us go somewhere else.  We will not go into\nthe crypt to-day!'\n\n'Why not?'  The lips that spoke were pouted mutinously and the face was\nflushed.  The imperious little lady was not at all satisfied to give up\nthe cherished project.  For a whole day and night she had, whilst waking,\nthought of the coming adventure; the thrill of it was not now to be\nturned to cold disappointment without even an explanation.  She did not\nthink that Harold was afraid; that would be ridiculous.  But she\nwondered; and mysteries always annoyed her.  She did not like to be at\r\nfault, more especially when other people knew.  All the pride in her\nrevolted.\n\n'Why not?' she repeated more imperiously still.\n\nHarold said kindly:\n\n'Because, Stephen, there is really a good reason.  Don't ask me, for I\ncan't tell you.  You must take it from me that I am right.  You know,\ndear, that I wouldn't willingly disappoint you; and I know that you had\nset your heart on this.  But indeed, indeed I have a good reason.'\n\nStephen was really angry now.  She was amenable to reason, though she did\r\nnot consciously know what reason was; but to accept some one else's\nreason blindfold was repugnant to her nature, even at her then age.  She\nwas about to speak angrily, but looking up she saw that Harold's mouth\nwas set with marble firmness.  So, after her manner, she acquiesced in\nthe inevitable and said:\n\n'All right!  Harold.'\n\nBut in the inner recesses of her firm-set mind was a distinct intention\nto visit the vault when more favourable circumstances would permit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--THE CRYPT\n\n\nIt was some weeks before Stephen got the chance she wanted.  She knew it","would be difficult to evade Harold's observation, for the big boy's\nacuteness as to facts had impressed itself on her.  It was strange that\nout of her very trust in Harold came a form of distrust in others.  In\nthe little matter of evading him she inclined to any one in whom there\nwas his opposite, in whose reliability she instinctively mistrusted.\n'There is nothing bad or good but thinking makes it so!'  To enter that\ncrypt, which had seemed so small a matter at first, had now in process of\nthinking and wishing and scheming become a thing to be much desired.\r\nHarold saw, or rather felt, that something was in the girl's mind, and\ntook for granted that it had something to do with the crypt.  But he\nthought it better not to say anything lest he should keep awake a desire\nwhich he hoped would die naturally.\n\nOne day it was arranged that Harold should go over to Carstone to see the\nsolicitor who had wound up his father's business.  He was to stay the\nnight and ride back next day.  Stephen, on hearing of the arrangement, so\ncontrived matters that Master Everard, the son of a banker who had\r\nrecently purchased an estate in the neighbourhood, was asked to come to\nplay with her on the day when Harold left.  It was holiday time at Eton,\nand he was at home.  Stephen did not mention to Harold the fact of his\ncoming; it was only from a chance allusion of Mrs. Jarrold before he went\nthat he inferred it.  He did not think the matter of sufficient\nimportance to wonder why Stephen, who generally told him everything, had\nnot mentioned this.\n\nDuring their play, Stephen, after pledging him to secrecy, told Leonard\nof her intention of visiting the crypt, and asked him to help her in it.\r\nThis was an adventure, and as such commended itself to the schoolboy\nheart.  He entered at once into the scheme con amore; and the two\ndiscussed ways and means.  Leonard's only regret was that he was\nassociated with a little girl in such a project.  It was something of a\nblow to his personal vanity, which was a large item in his moral\nequipment, that such a project should have been initiated by the girl and\nnot by himself.  He was to get possession of the key and in the forenoon\nof the next day he was to be waiting in the churchyard, when Stephen","would join him as soon as she could evade her nurse.  She was now more\nthan eleven, and had less need of being watched than in her earlier\nyears.  It was possible, with strategy, to get away undiscovered for an\nhour.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAt Carstone Harold got though what he had to do that same afternoon and\narranged to start early in the morning for Normanstand.  After an early\nbreakfast he set out on his thirty-mile journey at eight o'clock.\nLittlejohn, his horse, was in excellent form, notwithstanding his long\r\njourney of the day before, and with his nose pointed for home, put his\nbest foot foremost.  Harold felt in great spirits.  The long ride the day\nbefore had braced him physically, though there were on his journey times\nof great sadness when the thought of his father came back to him and the\nsense of loss was renewed with each thought of his old home.  But youth\nis naturally buoyant.  His visit to the church, the first thing on his\narrival at Carstone, and his kneeling before the stone made sacred to his\nfather's memory, though it entailed a silent gush of tears, did him good,\r\nand even seemed to place his sorrow farther away.  When he came again in\nthe morning before leaving Carstone there were no tears.  There was only\na holy memory which seemed to sanctify loss; and his father seemed nearer\nto him than ever.\n\nAs he drew near Normanstand he looked forward eagerly to seeing Stephen,\nand the sight of the old church lying far below him as he came down the\nsteep road over Alt Hill, which was the short-cut from Norcester, set his\nmind working.  His visit to the tomb of his own father made him think of\r\nthe day when he kept Stephen from entering the crypt.\n\nThe keenest thought is not always conscious.  It was without definite\nintention that when he came to the bridle-path Harold turned his horse's\nhead and rode down to the churchyard.  As he pushed open the door of the\nchurch he half expected to see Stephen; and there was a vague possibility\nthat Leonard Everard might be with her.\n\nThe church was cool and dim.  Coming from the hot glare the August\nsunshine it seemed, at the first glance, dark.  He looked around, and a\nsense of relief came over him.  The place was empty.","But even as he stood, there came a sound which made his heart grow cold.\nA cry, muffled, far away and full of anguish; a sobbing cry, which\nsuddenly ceased.\n\nIt was the voice of Stephen.  He instinctively knew where it came from;\nthe crypt.  Only for the experience he had had of her desire to enter the\nplace, he would never have suspected that it was so close to him.  He ran\ntowards the corner where commenced the steps leading downward.  As he\nreached the spot a figure came rushing up the steps.  A boy in Eton\njacket and wide collar, careless, pale, and agitated.  It was Leonard\r\nEverard.  Harold seized him as he came.\n\n'Where is Stephen?' he cried in a quick, low voice.\n\n'In the vault below there.  She dropped her light and then took mine, and\nshe dropped it too.  Let me go!  Let me go!'  He struggled to get away;\nbut Harold held him tight.\n\n'Where are the matches?'\n\n'In my pocket.  Let me go!  Let me go!'\n\n'Give me them--this instant!'  He was examining the frightened boy's\nwaistcoat pockets as he spoke.  When he had got the matches he let the\nboy go, and ran down the steps and through the open door into the crypt,\r\ncalling out as he came:\n\n'Stephen!  Stephen dear, where are you?  It is I--Harold!'  There was no\nresponse; his heart seemed to grow cold and his knees to weaken.  The\nmatch spluttered and flashed, and in the momentary glare he saw across\nthe vault, which was not a large place, a white mass on the ground.  He\nhad to go carefully, lest the match should be blown out by the wind of\nhis passage; but on coming close he saw that it was Stephen lying\nsenseless in front of a great coffin which rested on a built-out pile of\r\nmasonry.  Then the match went out.  In the flare of the next one he lit\nhe saw a piece of candle lying on top of the coffin.  He seized and lit\nit.  He was able to think coolly despite his agitation, and knew that\nlight was the first necessity.  The bruised wick was slow to catch; he\nhad to light another match, his last one, before it flamed.  The couple\nof seconds that the light went down till the grease melted and the flame\nleaped again seemed of considerable length.  When the lit candle was\nplaced steadily on top of the coffin, and a light, dim, though strong","enough to see with, spread around, he stooped and lifted Stephen in his\narms.  She was quite senseless, and so limp that a great fear came upon\nhim that she might be dead.  He did not waste time, but carried her\nacross the vault where the door to the church steps stood out sharp\nagainst the darkness, and bore her up into the church.  Holding her in\none arm, with the other hand he dragged some long cushions from one of\nthe pews and spread them on the floor; on these he laid her.  His heart\nwas smitten with love and pity as he looked.  She was so helpless; so\r\npitifully helpless!  Her arms and legs were doubled up as though broken,\ndisjointed; the white frock was smeared with patches of thick dust.\nInstinctively he stooped and pulled the frock down and straightened out\nthe arms and feet.  He knelt beside her, and felt if her heart was still\nbeating, a great fear over him, a sick apprehension.  A gush of thankful\nprayer came from his heart.  Thank God! she was alive; he could feel her\nheart beat, though faintly underneath his hand.  He started to his feet\r\nand ran towards the door, seizing his hat, which lay on a seat.  He\nwanted it to bring back some water.  As he passed out of the door he saw\nLeonard a little distance off, but took no notice of him.  He ran to the\nstream, filled his hat with water, and brought it back.  When he came\ninto the church he saw Stephen, already partially restored, sitting up on\nthe cushions with Leonard supporting her.\n\nHe was rejoiced; but somehow disappointed.  He would rather Leonard had\nnot been there.  He remembered--he could not forget--the white face of\r\nthe boy who fled out of the crypt leaving Stephen in a faint within, and\nwho had lingered outside the church door whilst he ran for water.  Harold\ncame forward quickly and raised Stephen, intending to bring her into the\nfresh air.  He had a shrewd idea that the sight of the sky and God's\ngreenery would be the best medicine for her after her fright.  He lifted\nher in his strong arms as he used to do when she was a very little child\nand had got tired in their walks together; and carried her to the door.\nShe lent herself unconsciously to the movement, holding fast with her arm","round his neck as she used to do.  In her clinging was the expression of\nher trust in him.  The little sigh with which she laid her head on his\nshoulder was the tribute to his masculine power, and her belief in it.\nEvery instant her senses were coming back to her more and more.  The veil\nof oblivion was passing from her half-closed eyes, as the tide of full\nremembrance swept in upon her.  Her inner nature was expressed in the\nsequence of her emotions.  Her first feeling was one of her own fault.\nThe sight of Harold and his proximity recalled to her vividly how he had\r\nrefused to go into the crypt, and how she had intentionally deceived him,\nnegatively, as to her intention of doing that of which he disapproved.\nHer second feeling was one of justice; and was perhaps partially evoked\nby the sight of Leonard, who followed close as Harold brought her to the\ndoor.  She did not wish to speak of herself or Harold before him; but she\ndid not hesitate to speak of him to Harold:\n\n'You must not blame Leonard.  It was all my fault.  I made him come!'  Her\ngenerosity appealed to Harold.  He was angry with the boy for being there\r\nat all; but more for his desertion of the girl in her trouble.\n\n'I'm not blaming him for being with you!' he said simply.  Leonard spoke\nat once.  He had been waiting to defend himself, for that was what first\nconcerned that young gentleman; next to his pleasure, his safety most\nappealed to him.\n\n'I went to get help.  You had let the candle drop; and how could I see in\nthe dark?  You would insist on looking at the plate on the coffin!'\n\nA low moan broke from Stephen, a long, low, trembling moan which went to\nHarold's heart.  Her head drooped over again on his shoulder; and she\r\nclung close to him as the memory of her shock came back to her.  Harold\nspoke to Leonard over his shoulder in a low, fierce whisper, which\nStephen did not seem to hear:\n\n'There! that will do.  Go away!  You have done enough already.  Go!  Go!'\nhe added more sternly, as the boy seemed disposed to argue.  Leonard ran\na few steps, then walked to the lich-gate, where he waited.\n\nStephen clung close to Harold in a state of agitation which was almost\nhysterical.  She buried her face in his shoulder, sobbing brokenly:","'Oh, Harold!  It was too awful.  I never thought, never for a moment,\nthat my poor dear mother was buried in the crypt.  And when I went to\nlook at the name on the coffin that was nearest to where I was, I knocked\naway the dust, and then I saw her name: \"Margaret Norman, aetat 22.\"  I\ncouldn't bear it.  She was only a girl herself, only just twice my\nage--lying there in that terrible dark place with all the thick dust and\nthe spiders' webs.  Oh, Harold, Harold!  How shall I ever bear to think\nof her lying there, and that I shall never see her dear face?  Never!\r\nNever!'\n\nHe tried to soothe her by patting and holding her hands.  For a good\nwhile the resolution of the girl faltered, and she was but as a little\nchild.  Then her habitual strength of mind asserted itself.  She did not\nask Harold how she came to be out in the church instead of in the crypt\nwhen she recovered her senses.  She seemed to take it for granted that\nLeonard had carried her out; and when she said how brave it had been of\nhim, Harold, with his customary generosity, allowed her to preserve the\r\nbelief.  When they had made their way to the gate Leonard came up to\nthem; but before he could speak Stephen had begun to thank him.  He\nallowed her to do so, though the sight of Harold's mouth set in scorn,\nand his commanding eyes firmly fixed on him, made him grow hot and cold\nalternately.  He withdrew without speaking; and took his way home with a\nheart full of bitterness and revengeful feelings.\n\nIn the park Stephen tried to dust herself, and then Harold tried to\nassist her.  But her white dress was incurably soiled, the fine dust of\r\nthe vault seemed to have got ingrained in the muslin.  When she got to\nthe house she stole upstairs, so that no one might notice her till she\nhad made herself tidy.\n\nThe next day but one she took Harold for a walk in the afternoon.  When\nthey were quite alone and out of earshot she said:\n\n'I have been thinking all night about poor mother.  Of course I know she\ncannot be moved from the crypt.  She must remain there.  But there\nneedn't be all that dust.  I want you to come there with me some time\nsoon.  I fear I am afraid to go alone.  I want to bring some flowers and","to tidy up the place.  Won't you come with me this time?  I know now,\nHarold, why you didn't let me go in before.  But now it is different.\nThis is not curiosity.  It is Duty and Love.  Won't you come with me,\nHarold?'\n\nHarold leaped from the edge of the ha-ha where he had been sitting and\nheld up his hand.  She took it and leaped down lightly beside him.\n\n'Come,' he said, 'let us go there now!'  She took his arm when they got\non the path again, and clinging to him in her pretty girlish way they\nwent together to the piece of garden which she called her own; there they\r\npicked a great bunch of beautiful white flowers.  Then they walked to the\nold church.  The door was open and they passed in.  Harold took from his\npocket a tiny key.  This surprised her, and heightened the agitation\nwhich she naturally suffered from revisiting the place.  She said nothing\nwhilst he opened the door to the crypt.  Within, on a bracket, stood some\ncandles in glass shades and boxes of matches.  Harold lit three candles,\nand leaving one of them on the shelf, and placing his cap beside it, took\r\nthe other two in his hands.  Stephen, holding her flowers tightly to her\nbreast with her right hand, took Harold's arm with the left, and with\nbeating heart entered the crypt.\n\nFor several minutes Harold kept her engaged, telling her about the crypt\nin his father's church, and how he went down at his last visit to see the\ncoffin of his dear father, and how he knelt before it.  Stephen was much\nmoved, and held tight to his arm, her heart beating.  But in the time she\nwas getting accustomed to the place.  Her eyes, useless at first on\r\ncoming out of the bright sunlight, and not able to distinguish anything,\nbegan to take in the shape of the place and to see the rows of great\ncoffins that stood out along the far wall.  She also saw with surprise\nthat the newest coffin, on which for several reasons her eyes rested, was\nno longer dusty but was scrupulously clean.  Following with her eyes as\nwell as she could see into the further corners she saw that there the\nsame reform had been effected.  Even the walls and ceiling had been swept\nof the hanging cobwebs, and the floor was clean with the cleanliness of","ablution.  Still holding Harold's arm, she moved over towards her\nmother's coffin and knelt before it.  Harold knelt with her; for a little\nwhile she remained still and silent, praying inwardly.  Then she rose,\nand taking her great bunch of flowers placed them lovingly on the lid of\nthe coffin above where she thought her mother's heart would be.  Then she\nturned to Harold, her eyes flowing and her cheeks wet with tears, and\nlaid her head against his breast.  Her arms could not go round his neck\ntill he had bent his head, for with his great height he simply towered\r\nabove her.  Presently she was quiet; the paroxysm of her grief had\npassed.  She took Harold's hand in both hers, and together they went to\nthe door.  With his disengaged hand, for he would not have disturbed the\nother for worlds, Harold put out the lights and locked the door behind\nthem.\n\nIn the church she held him away from her, and looked him fairly in the\nface.  She said slowly:\n\n'Harold, was it you who had the crypt cleaned?'  He answered in a low\nvoice:\n\n'I knew you would want to go again!'\n\nShe took the great hand which she held between hers, and before he knew\r\nwhat she was doing and could prevent her, raised it to her lips and\nkissed it, saying lovingly:\n\n'Oh, Harold!  No brother in all the wide world could be kinder.  And--and--'\nthis with a sob, 'we both thank you; mother and I!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--A VISIT TO OXFORD\n\n\nThe next important move in the household was Harold's going to Cambridge.\nHis father had always intended this, and Squire Norman had borne his\nwishes in mind.  Harold joined Trinity, the college which had been his\nfather's, and took up his residence in due course.\r\nStephen was now nearly twelve.  Her range of friendships, naturally\nlimited by her circumstances in life, was enlarged to the full; and if\nshe had not many close friends there were at least of them all that was\nnumerically possible.  She still kept up to certain degree the little\ngatherings which in her childhood were got together for her amusement,\nand in the various games then instituted she still took a part.  She\nnever lost sight of the fact that her father took a certain pleasure in\nher bodily vigour.  And though with her growing years and the conscious","acceptance of her womanhood, she lost sight of the old childish fancy of\nbeing a boy instead of a girl, she could not lose sight of the fact that\nstrength and alertness are sources of feminine as well as of masculine\npower.\n\nAmongst the young friends who came from time to time during his holidays\nwas Leonard Everard, now a tall, handsome boy.  He was one of those boys\nwho develop young, and who seem never to have any of that gawky stage so\nnoticeable in the youth of men made in a large pattern.  He was always\nwell-poised, trim-set, alert; fleet of foot, and springy all over.  In\r\ngames he was _facile princeps_, seeming to make his effort always in the\nright way and without exertion, as if by an instinct of physical\nmasterdom.  His universal success in such matters helped to give him an\neasy debonair manner which was in itself winning.  So physically complete\na youth has always a charm.  In its very presence there is a sort of\nsympathetic expression, such as comes with the sunshine.\n\nStephen always in Leonard's presence showed something of the common\nattitude.  His youth and beauty and sex all had their influence on her.\r\nThe influence of sex, as it is understood with regard to a later period\nof life, did not in her case exist; Cupid's darts are barbed and winged\nfor more adult victims.  But in her case Leonard's masculine superiority,\nemphasised by the few years between their age, his sublime self-belief,\nand, above all, his absolute disregard for herself or her wishes or her\nfeelings, put him on a level at which she had to look up to him.  The\nfirst step in the ladder of pre-eminence had been achieved when she\r\nrealised that he was not on her level; the second when she experienced\nrather than thought that he had more influence on her than she had on\nhim.  Here again was a little morsel of hero worship, which, though based\non a misconception of fact, was still of influence.  In that episode of\nthe crypt she had always believed that it was Leonard who had carried her\nout and laid her on the church floor in light and safety.  He had been\nstrong enough and resolute enough to do this, whilst she had fainted!\nHarold's generous forbearance had really worked to a false end.","It was not strange, therefore, that she found occasional companionship\nwith the handsome, wilful, domineering boy somewhat of luxury.  She did\nnot see him often enough to get tired of him; to find out the weakness of\nhis character; to realise his deep-seated, remorseless selfishness.  But\nafter all he was only an episode in a young life which was full of\ninterests.  Term after term came and went; the holidays had their\nseasonable pleasures, occasionally shared in common.  That was all.\n\nHarold's attitude was the same as ever.  He was of a constant nature; and\r\nnow that manhood was within hail the love of his boyhood was ripening to\na man's love.  That was all.  He was with regard to Stephen the same\ndevoted, worshipping protector, without thought of self; without hope of\nreward.  Whatever Stephen wished Harold did; and Stephen, knowing their\nold wishes and their old pleasures, was content with their renewal.  Each\nholiday between the terms became mainly a repetition of the days of the\nold life.  They lived in the past.\n\nAmongst the things that did not change was Stephen's riding dress.  The\r\nscarlet habit had never been a thing for everyday wear, but had from the\nfirst been kept for special occasions.  Stephen herself knew that it was\nnot a conventional costume; but she rather preferred it, if on that\naccount alone.  In a certain way she felt justified in using it; for a\nred habit was a sort of tradition in the family.\n\nIt was on one of these occasions that she had gone with Harold into the\nchurchyard where they had heard the discussion regarding God and the\nAngels.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen Stephen was about sixteen she went for a short visit to Oxford.  She\r\nstayed at Somerville with Mrs. Egerton, an old friend of her mother's,\nwho was a professor at the college.  She sent back her maid who had\ntravelled with her, as she knew that the college girls did not have\nservants of their own.  The visit was prolonged by mutual consent into a\nduration of some weeks.  Stephen fell in love with the place and the\nlife, and had serious thoughts of joining the college herself.  Indeed\nshe had made up her mind to ask her father to allow her, knowing well\nthat he would consent to that or to any other wholesome wish of hers.  But","then came the thought that he would be all alone at home; and following\nthat came another thought, and one of more poignant feeling.  He was\nalone now!  Already, for many days, she had left him, for the first time\nin her life!  Stephen was quick to act; well she knew that at home there\nwould be no fault found with her for a speedy return.  Within a few hours\nshe had brought her visit to an end, and was by herself, despite Mrs.\nEgerton's protest, in the train on the way back to Norcester.\n\nIn the train she began to review, for the first time, her visit to the\r\nuniversity.  All had been so strange and new and delightful to her that\nshe had never stopped for retrospect.  Life in the new and enchanting\nplace had been in the moving present.  The mind had been receptive only,\ngathering data for later thought.  During her visit she had had no one to\ndirect her thought, and so it had been all personal, with the freedom of\nindividuality at large.  Of course her mother's friend, skilled in the\nmind-workings of average girls, and able to pick her way through\r\nintellectual and moral quagmires, had taken good care to point out to her\ncertain intellectual movements and certain moral lessons; just as she had\nin their various walks and drives pointed out matters of\ninterest--architectural beauties and spots of historic import.  And she\nhad taken in, loyally accepted, and thoroughly assimilated all that she\nhad been told.  But there were other lessons which were for her young\neyes; facts which the older eyes had ceased to notice, if they had ever\nnoticed them at all.  The self-content, the sex-content in the endless\r\ntide of young men that thronged the streets and quads and parks; the all-\nsufficing nature of sport or study, to whichever their inclinations\ntended.  The small part which womankind seemed to have in their lives.\nStephen had had, as we know, a peculiar training; whatever her instincts\nwere, her habits were largely boy habits.  Here she was amongst boys, a\nglorious tide of them; it made now and again her heart beat to look at\nthem.  And yet amongst them all she was only an outsider.  She could not\ndo anything better than any of them.  Of course, each time she went out,","she became conscious of admiring glances; she could not be woman without\nsuch consciousness.  But it was as a girl that men looked at her, not as\nan equal.  As well as personal experience and the lessons of eyes and\nears and intelligence, there were other things to classify and adjust;\nthings which were entirely from the outside of her own life.  The\nfragments of common-room gossip, which it had been her fortune to hear\naccidentally now and again.  The half confidences of scandals, borne on\nwhispered breaths.  The whole confidences of dormitory and study which\r\nshe had been privileged to share.  All were parts of the new and strange\nworld, the great world which had swum into her ken.\n\nAs she sat now in the train, with some formulation of memory already\naccomplished in the two hours of solitude, her first comment, spoken half\naudibly, would have surprised her teachers as much as it would have\nsurprised herself, if she had been conscious of it; for as yet her\nthinking was not self-conscious:\n\n'Surely, I am not like that!'\n\nIt was of the women she had been thinking, not of the men.  The glimpse\r\nwhich she had had of her own sex had been an awakening to her; and the\nawakening had not been to a pleasant world.  All at once she seemed to\nrealise that her sex had defects--littlenesses, meannesses, cowardices,\nfalsenesses.  That their occupations were apt to be trivial or narrow or\nselfish; that their desires were earthly, and their tastes coarse; that\nwhat she held to be goodness was apt to be realised only as fear.  That\ninnocence was but ignorance, or at least baffled curiosity.  That . . .\n\nA flood of shame swept over her, and instinctively she put her hands\r\nbefore her burning face.  As usual, she was running all at once into\nextremes.\n\nAnd above all these was borne upon her, and for the first time in her\nlife, that she was herself a woman!\n\nFor a long time she sat quite still.  The train thrilled and roared on\nits way.  Crowded stations took and gave their quantum of living freight;\nbut the young girl sat abstracted, unmoved, seemingly unconscious.  All\nthe dominance and energy of her nature were at work.\n\nIf, indeed, she was a woman, and had to abide by the exigencies of her","own sex, she would at least not be ruled and limited by woman's weakness.\nShe would plan and act and manage things for herself, in her own way.\n\nWhatever her thoughts might be, she could at least control her acts.  And\nthose acts should be based not on woman's weakness, but on man's\nstrength!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--THE NEED OF KNOWING\n\n\nWhen Stephen announced her intention of going with her father to the\nPetty Sessions Court, there was consternation amongst the female\npopulation of Normanstand and Norwood.  Such a thing had not been heard\r\nof in the experiences of any of them.  Courts of Justice were places for\nmen; and the lower courts dealt with a class of cases . . . It was quite\nimpossible to imagine where any young lady could get such an idea . . .\n\nMiss Laetitia Rowly recognised that she had a difficult task before her,\nfor she was by now accustomed to Stephen's quiet method of having her own\nway.\n\nShe made a careful toilet before driving over to Normanstand.  Her\nwearing her best bonnet was a circumstance not unattended with dread for\nsome one.  Behold her then, sailing into the great drawing-room at\r\nNormanstand with her mind so firmly fixed on the task before her as to be\noblivious of minor considerations.  She was so fond of Stephen, and\nadmired so truly her many beauties and fine qualities, that she was\nsecure and without flaw in her purpose.  Stephen was in danger, and\nthough she doubted if she would be able to effect any change, she was\ndetermined that at least she should not go into danger with her eyes\nunopened.\n\nStephen entered hastily and ran to her.  She loved her great-aunt; really\r\nand truly loved her.  And indeed it would have been strange if she had\nnot, for from the earliest hour which she could recollect she had\nreceived from her nothing but the truest, fondest affection.  Moreover\nshe deeply respected the old lady, her truth, her resolution, her\nkindliness, her genuine common-sense ability.  Stephen always felt safe\nwith her aunt.  In the presence of others she might now and again have a\nqualm or a doubt; but not with her.  There was an abiding calm in her\nlove, answering love realised and respected.  Her long and intimate","knowledge of Laetitia made her aware of her moods.  She could read the\nsigns of them.  She knew well the meaning of the bonnet which actually\nseemed to quiver as though it had a sentience of its own.  She knew well\nthe cause of her aunt's perturbation; the pain which must be caused to\nher was perhaps the point of most resistance in herself--she having made\nup her mind to her new experience.  All she could do would be to try to\nreconcile her by the assurance of good intention; by reason, and by\nsweetness of manner.  When she had kissed her and sat beside her, holding\r\nher hand after her pretty way, she, seeing the elder woman somewhat at a\nloss, opened the subject herself:\n\n'You look troubled, auntie!  I hope it is nothing serious?'\n\n'It is, my dear!  Very serious!  Everything is serious to me which\ntouches you.'\n\n'Me, Auntie!'  Hypocrisy is a fine art.\n\n'Yes! yes, Stephen.  Oh! my dear child, what is this I hear about your\ngoing to Petty Sessions with your father?'\n\n'Oh, that!  Why, Auntie dear, you must not let that trouble you.  It is\nall right.  That is necessary!'\r\n'Necessary!' the old lady's figure grew rigid and her voice was loud and\nhigh.  'Necessary for a young lady to go to a court house.  To hear low\npeople speaking of low crimes.  To listen to cases of the most shocking\nkind; cases of low immorality; cases of a kind, of a nature of a--a--class\nthat you are not supposed to know anything about.  Really, Stephen! . . .\n'  She was drawing away her hand in indignation.  But Stephen held it\ntight, as she said very sweetly:\n\n'That is just it, Auntie.  I am so ignorant that I feel I should know\r\nmore of the lives of those very people!'  Miss Laetitia interrupted:\n\n'Ignorant!  Of course you are ignorant.  That is what you ought to be.\nIsn't it what we have all been devoting ourselves to effect ever since\nyou were born?  Read your third chapter of Genesis and remember what came\nof eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.'\n\n'I think the Tree of Knowledge must have been an orange tree.'  The old\nlady looked up, her interest aroused:\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Because ever since Eden other brides have worn its blossom!'  Her tone\nwas demure.  Miss Rowly looked sharply at her, but her sharpness softened","off into a smile.\n\n'H'm!' she said, and was silent.  Stephen seized the opportunity to put\nher own case:\n\n'Auntie dear, you must forgive me!  You really must, for my heart is set\non this.  I assure you I am not doing it merely to please myself.  I have\nthought over the whole matter.  Father has always wished me to be in a\nposition--a position of knowledge and experience--to manage Normanstand\nif I should ever succeed him.  From the earliest time I can remember he\nhas always kept this before me, and though of course I did not at first\r\nunderstand what it meant, I have seemed in the last few years to know\nbetter.  Accordingly I learned all sorts of things under his care, and\nsometimes even without his help.  I have studied the estate map, and I\nhave been over the estate books and read some of the leases and all such\nmatters which they deal with in the estate office.  This only told me the\nbones of the thing.  I wanted to know more of our people; and so I made a\npoint of going now and again to each house that we own.  Of seeing the\npeople and talking with them familiarly; as familiarly as they would let\r\nme, and indeed so far as was possible considering my position.  For,\nAuntie dear, I soon began to learn--to learn in a way there was no\nmistaking--what my position is.  And so I want to get to know more of\ntheir ordinary lives; the darker as well as the lighter side.  I would\nlike to do them good.  I can see how my dear daddy has always been a sort\nof power to help them, and I would like to carry on his work; to carry it\nfurther if I may.  But I must know.'\n\nHer aunt had been listening with growing interest, and with growing\r\nrespect too, for she realised the intense earnestness which lay behind\nthe girl's words and her immediate purpose.  Her voice and manner were\nboth softened:\n\n'But, my dear, surely it is not necessary to go into the Court to know\nthese things.  The results of each case become known.'\n\n'That is just it, Auntie,' she answered quickly.  'The magistrates have\nto hear the two sides of the case before even they can make up their\nminds.  I want to hear both sides, too!  If people are guilty, I want to\nknow the cause of their guilt.  If they are innocent, I want to know what","the circumstances can be which make innocence look like guilt.  In my own\ndaily life I may be in the way of just such judgments; and surely it is\nonly right that judgment should be just!'\n\nAgain she paused; there rose before her mind that conversation in the\nchurchyard when Harold had said that it was difficult for women to be\njust.\n\nMiss Rowly reflected too.  She was becoming convinced that in principle\nthe girl was right.  But the details were repugnant as ever to her;\nconcentrating her mind on the point where she felt the ground firm under\r\nher, she made her objection:\n\n'But, Stephen dear, there are so many cases that are sordid and painful!'\n\n'The more need to know of sordid things; if sordidness plays so important\na part in the tragedy of their lives!'\n\n'But there are cases which are not within a woman's province.  Cases that\ntouch sin . . . '\n\n'What kind of sin do you mean?  Surely all wrong-doing is sin!'  The old\nlady was embarrassed.  Not by the fact, for she had been for too many\nyears the mistress of a great household not to know something of the\r\nsubject on which she spoke, but that she had to speak of such a matter to\nthe young girl whom she so loved.\n\n'The sin, my dear, of . . . of woman's wrong-doing . . . as woman . . .\nof motherhood, without marriage!'  All Stephen's nature seemed to rise in\nrevolt.\n\n'Why, Auntie,' she spoke out at once, 'you yourself show the want of the\nvery experience I look for!'\n\n'How? what?' asked the old lady amazed and bristling.  Stephen took her\nhand and held it affectionately as she spoke:\n\n'You speak of a woman's wrong-doing, when surely it is a man's as well.\r\nThere does not seem to be blame for him who is the more guilty.  Only for\npoor women! . . . And, Auntie dear, it is such poor women that I should\nlike to help . . . Not when it is too late, but before!  But how can I\nhelp unless I know?  Good girls cannot tell me, and good women won't!  You\nyourself, Auntie, didn't want to speak on the subject; even to me!'\n\n'But, my dear child, these are not things for unmarried women.  I never\nspeak of them myself except with matrons.'  Stephen's answer flashed out\nlike a sword; and cut like one:","'And yet you are unmarried!  Oh, Auntie dear, I did not and I do not mean\nto be offensive, or to hurt you in any way.  I know, dear, your goodness\nand your kindness to all.  But you limit yourself to one side!'  The\nelder lady interrupted:\n\n'How do you mean? one side! which side?'\n\n'The punishment side.  I want to know the cause of that which brings the\npunishment.  There surely is some cross road in a girl's life where the\nways part.  I want to stand there if I can, with warning in one hand and\nhelp in the other.  Oh! Auntie, Auntie, can't you see that my heart is in\r\nthis . . . These are our people; Daddy says they are to be my people; and\nI want to know their lives right through; to understand their wants, and\ntheir temptations, and their weakness.  Bad and good, whatever it be, I\nmust know it all; or I shall be working in the dark, and may injure or\ncrush where I had looked to help and raise.'\n\nAs she spoke she looked glorified.  The afternoon autumn sun shone full\nthrough the great window and lighted her up till she looked like a\nspirit.  Lighted her white diaphanous dress till it seemed to take shape\r\nas an ethereal robe; lighted her red hair till it looked like a celestial\ncrown; lighted her great dark eyes till their black beauty became swept\nin the tide of glory.\n\nThe heart of the old woman who loved her best heaved, and her bosom\nswelled with pride.  Instinctively she spoke:\n\n'Oh, you noble, beautiful creature!  Of course you are right, and your\nway is God's way!'  With tears that rained down her furrowed cheeks, she\nput her arms round the girl and kissed her fondly.  Still holding her in\nher arms she gave her the gentle counsel which was the aftermath of her\r\nmoment of inspiration.\n\n'But Stephen dear, do be careful!  Knowledge is a two-edged sword, and it\nis apt to side with pride.  Remember what was the last temptation of the\nserpent to Eve: \"Your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods,\nknowing good and evil.\"'\n\n'I shall be very careful,' she said gravely; and then added as if by an\nafterthought, 'of course you understand that my motive is the acquisition\nof knowledge?'\n\n'Yes?' the answer was given interrogatively.\n\n'Don't you think, dear, that Eve's object was not so much the acquisition","of knowledge as the gratification of curiosity.'\n\n'That may be,' said the elder lady in a doubtful tone; 'but my dear, who\nis to enlighten us as to which is which?  We are apt in such matters to\ndeceive ourselves.  The more we know, the better are we able to deceive\nothers; and the better we are able to deceive others the better we are\nable to deceive ourselves.  As I tell you, dear, knowledge is two-edged\nand needs extra carefulness in its use!'\n\n'True!' said Stephen reflectively.  Long after her aunt had gone she sat\nthinking.\n\n* * * * *\r\nOnce again did Miss Rowly try to restrain Stephen from a project.  This\nwas when a little later she wished to go for a few days to the University\nMission House in the East end of London.  Ever since her visit to Oxford\nshe had kept up a correspondence with her mother's old friend.  It was\nthis lady's habit to spend a part of vacation in the Mission; and Stephen\nhad had much correspondence with her regarding the work.  At last she\nwrote that if she might, she would like to come and see for herself.  The\nanswer was a cordial invitation, armed with which she asked her father to\r\nallow her to go.  He at once assented.  He had been watching keenly the\ndevelopment of her character, and had seen with pride and satisfaction\nthat as time went on she seemed to acquire greater resolution, larger\nself-dependence.  She was becoming more and more of his ideal.  Without\nlosing any of her womanhood, she was beginning to look at things more\nfrom a man's point of view than is usually done by, or possible to,\nwomen.\n\nWhen she returned at the end of a week she was full of new gravity.  After\na while this so far changed that her old lighter moods began to have\r\ntheir place, but it seemed that she never lost, and that she never would\nlose, the effect of that week of bitter experience amongst the 'submerged\ntenth.'\n\nThe effect of the mental working was shown by a remark made by Harold\nwhen home on his next college vacation.  He had been entering with her on\na discussion of an episode on the estate:\n\n'Stephen, you are learning to be just!'\n\nAt the moment she was chagrined by the remark, though she accepted it in\nsilence; but later, when she had thought the matter over, she took from","it infinite pleasure.  This was indeed to share man's ideas and to think\nwith the workings of man's mind.  It encouraged her to further and larger\nideas, and to a greater toleration than she had hitherto dreamed of.\n\nOf all those who loved her, none seemed to understand so fully as\nLaetitia Rowly the change in her mental attitude, or rather the\ndevelopment of it.  Now and again she tried to deflect or modify certain\ncoming forces, so that the educational process in which she had always\nhad a part would continue in the right direction.  But she generally\r\nfound that the girl had been over the ground so thoroughly that she was\nable to defend her position.  Once, when she had ventured to remonstrate\nwith her regarding her attitude of woman's equality with man, she felt as\nif Stephen's barque was indeed entering on dangerous seas.  The occasion\nhad arisen thus: Stephen had been what her aunt had stigmatised as\n'laying down the law' with regard to the position a married woman, and\nMiss Rowly, seeing a good argumentative opening, remarked:\n\n'But what if a woman does not get the opportunity of being married?'\r\nStephen looked at her a moment before saying with conviction:\n\n'It is a woman's fault if she does not get the opportunity!'  The old\nlady smiled as she answered:\n\n'Her fault?  My dear, what if no man asks her?'  This seemed to her own\nmind a poser.\n\n'Still her own fault!  Why doesn't she ask him?'  Her aunt's lorgnon was\ndropped in horrified amazement.\n\nStephen went on impassively.\n\n'Certainly!  Why shouldn't she?  Marriage is a union.  As it is in the\neye of the law a civil contract, either party to it should be at liberty\r\nto originate the matter.  If a woman is not free to think of a man in all\nways, how is she to judge of the suitability of their union?  And if she\nis free in theory, why not free to undertake if necessary the initiative\nin a matter so momentous to herself?'  The old lady actually groaned and\nwrung her hands; she was horrified at such sentiments.  They were daring\nenough to think; but to put them in words! . . .\n\n'Oh, my dear, my dear!' she moaned, 'be careful what you say.  Some one\nmight hear you who would not understand, as I do, that you are talking","theory.'  Stephen's habit of thought stood to her here.  She saw that her\naunt was distressed, and as she did not wish to pain her unduly, was\nwilling to divert the immediate channel of her fear.  She took the hand\nwhich lay in her lap and held it firmly whilst she smiled in the loving\nold eyes.\n\n'Of course, Auntie dear, it is theory.  But still it is a theory which I\nhold very strongly!' . . . Here a thought struck her and she said\nsuddenly:\n\n'Did you ever . . . How many proposals did you have, Auntie?'  The old\nlady smiled; her thoughts were already diverted.\r\n'Several, my dear!  It is so long ago that I don't remember!'\n\n'Oh yes, you do, Auntie!  No woman ever forgets that, no matter what else\nshe may or may not remember!  Tell me, won't you?'  The old lady blushed\nslightly as she answered:\n\n'There is no need to specify, my dear.  Let it be at this, that there\nwere more than you could count on your right hand!'\n\n'And why did you refuse them?'  The tone was wheedling, and the elder\nwoman loved to hear it.  Wheedling is the courtship, by the young of the\nold.\n\n'Because, my dear, I didn't love them.'\r\n'But tell me, Auntie, was there never any one that you did love?'\n\n'Ah! my dear, that is a different matter.  That is the real tragedy of a\nwoman's life.'  In flooding reminiscent thought she forgot her\nremonstrating; her voice became full of natural pathos:\n\n'To love; and be helpless!  To wait, and wait, and wait; with your heart\nall aflame!  To hope, and hope; till time seems to have passed away, and\nall the world to stand still on your hopeless misery!  To know that a\nword might open up Heaven; and yet to have to remain mute!  To keep back\r\nthe glances that could enlighten; to modulate the tones that might\nbetray!  To see all you hoped for passing away . . . to another! . . . '\n\nStephen bent over and kissed her, then standing up said:\n\n'I understand!  Isn't it wrong, Auntie, that there should be such\ntragedies?  Should not that glance be given?  Why should that tone be\nchecked?  Why should one be mute when a single word might, would, avert\nthe tragedy?  Is it not possible, Auntie, that there is something wrong\nin our social system when such things can happen; and can happen so","often?'\n\nShe looked remorseless as well as irresistible in the pride of her\nyouthful strength as with eyes that blazed, not flashing as in passion\nbut with a steady light that seemed to burn, she continued:\n\n'Some day women must learn their own strength, as well as they have\nlearned their own weakness.  They are taught this latter from their\ncradles up; but no one ever seems to teach them wherein their power lies.\nThey have to learn this for themselves; and the process and the result of\nthe self-teaching are not good.  In the University Settlement I learned\r\nmuch that made my heart ache; but out of it there seemed some lesson for\ngood.'  She paused; and her aunt, wishing to keep the subject towards\nhigher things, asked:\n\n'And that lesson, Stephen dear?'  The blazing eyes turned to her so that\nshe was stirred by them as the answer came:\n\n'It is bad women who seem to know men best, and to be able to influence\nthem most.  They can make men come and go at will.  They can turn and\ntwist and mould them as they choose.  And _they_ never hesitate to speak\ntheir own wishes; to ask for what they want.  There are no tragedies, of\r\nthe negative kind, in _their_ lives.  Their tragedies have come and gone\nalready; and their power remains.  Why should good women leave power to\nsuch as they?  Why should good women's lives be wrecked for a convention?\nWhy in the blind following of some society fetish should life lose its\ncharm, its possibilities?  Why should love eat its heart out, in vain?\nThe time will come when women will not be afraid to speak to men, as they\nshould speak, as free and equal.  Surely if a woman is to be the equal\r\nand lifelong companion of a man, the closest to him--nay, the only one\nreally close to him: the mother of his children--she should be free at\nthe very outset to show her inclination to him just as he would to her.\nDon't be frightened, Auntie dear; your eyes are paining me! . . . There!\nperhaps I said too much.  But after all it is only theory.  Take for your\ncomfort, Auntie dear, that I am free an heart-whole.  You need not fear\nfor me; I can see what your dear eyes tell me.  Yes!  I am very young;\nperhaps too young to think such things.  But I have thought of them.","Thought them all over in every way and phase I can imagine.'\n\nShe stopped suddenly; bending over, she took the old lady in her arms and\nkissed her fondly several times, holding her tight.  Then, as suddenly\nreleasing her, she ran away before she could say a word.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--THE T-CART\n\n\nWhen Harold took his degree, Stephen's father took her to Cambridge.  She\nenjoyed the trip very much; indeed, it seemed under conditions that were\nabsolutely happy.\n\nWhen they had returned to Normanstand, the Squire took an early\r\nopportunity of bringing Harold alone into his study.  He spoke to him\nwith what in a very young man would have seemed diffidence:\n\n'I have been thinking, Harold, that the time has come when you should be\naltogether your own master.  I am more than pleased, my boy, with the way\nyou have gone through college; it is, I am sure, just as your dear father\nwould have wished it, and as it would have pleased him best.'  He paused,\nand Harold said in a low voice:\n\n'I tried hard, sir, to do what I thought he would like; and what you\nwould.'  The Squire went on more cheerfully:\r\n'I know that, my boy!  I know that well.  And I can tell you that it is\nnot the least of the pleasures we have all had in your success, how you\nhave justified yourself.  You have won many honours in the schools, and\nyou have kept the reputation as an athlete which your father was so proud\nof.  Well, I suppose in the natural order of things you would go into a\nprofession; and of course if you so desire you can do that.  But if you\ncan see your way to it I would rather that you stayed here.  My house is\nyour home as long as I live; but I don't wish you to feel in any way\r\ndependent.  I want you to stay here if you will; but to do it just\nbecause you wish to.  To this end I have made over to you the estate at\nCamp which was my father's gift to me when I came of age.  It is not a\nvery large one; but it will give you a nice position of your own, and a\ncomfortable income.  And with it goes my blessing, my dear boy.  Take it\nas a gift from your father and myself!'\n\nHarold was much moved, not only by the act itself but by the gracious way\nof doing it.  There were tears in his eyes as he wrung the Squire's hand;","his voice thrilled with feeling as he said:\n\n'Your many goodnesses to my father's son, sir, will, I hope, be justified\nby his love and loyalty.  If I don't say much it is because I do not feel\nquite master of myself.  I shall try to show in time, as I cannot say it\nall at once, all that I feel.'\n\nHarold continued to live at Normanstand.  The house at Camp was in\nreality a charming cottage.  A couple of servants were installed, and now\nand again he stayed there for a few days as he wished to get accustomed\nto the place.  In a couple of months every one accepted the order of\r\nthings; and life at Normanstand went on much as it had done before Harold\nhad gone to college.  There was a man in the house now instead of a boy:\nthat was all.  Stephen too was beginning to be a young woman, but the\nrelative positions were the same as they had been.  Her growth did not\nseem to make an ostensible difference to any one.  The one who might have\nnoticed it most, Mrs. Jarrold, had died during the last year of Harold's\nlife at college.\n\nWhen the day came for the quarterly meeting of the magistrates of the\r\ncounty of Norcester, Squire Rowly arranged as usual to drive Squire\nNorman.  This had been their habit for good many years.  The two men\nusually liked to talk over the meeting as they returned home together.  It\nwas a beautiful morning for a drive, and when Rowly came flying up the\navenue in his T-cart with three magnificent bays, Stephen ran out on the\ntop of the steps to see him draw up.  Rowly was a fine whip, and his\nhorses felt it.  Squire Norman was ready, and, after a kiss from Stephen,\nclimbed into the high cart.  The men raised their hats and waved good-\r\nbye.  A word from Rowly; with a bound the horses were off.  Stephen stood\nlooking at them delighted; all was so sunny, so bright, so happy.  The\nworld was so full of life and happiness to-day that it seemed as if it\nwould never end; that nothing except good could befall.\n\nHarold, later on that morning, was to go into Norcester also; so Stephen\nwith a lonely day before her set herself to take up loose-ends of all\nsorts of little personal matters.  They would all meet at dinner as Rowly\nwas to stop the night at Normanstand.","Harold left the club in good time to ride home to dinner.  As he passed\nthe County Hotel he stopped to ask if Squire Norman had left; and was\ntold that he had started only a short time before with Squire Rowly in\nhis T-cart.  He rode on fast, thinking that perhaps he might overtake\nthem and ride on with them.  But the bays knew their work, and did it.\nThey kept their start; it was only at the top of the North hill, five\nmiles out of Norcester, that he saw them in the distance, flying along\nthe level road.  He knew he would not now overtake them, and so rode on\r\nsomewhat more leisurely.\n\nThe Norcester highroad, when it has passed the village of Brackling,\nturns away to the right behind the great clump of oaks.  From this the\nroad twists to the left again, making a double curve, and then runs to\nNorling Parva in a clear stretch of some miles before reaching the sharp\nturn down the hill which is marked 'Dangerous to Cyclists.'  From the\nlatter village branches the by-road over the hill which is the short cut\nto Normanstand.\n\nWhen Harold turned the corner under the shadow of the oaks he saw a\r\nbelated road-mender, surrounded by some gaping peasants, pointing\nexcitedly in the distance.  The man, who of course knew him, called to\nhim to stop.\n\n'What is it?' he asked, reining up.\n\n'It be Squire Rowly's bays which have run away with him.  Three on 'em,\nall in a row and comin' like the wind.  Squire he had his reins all\nright, but they 'osses didn't seem to mind 'un.  They was fair mad and\nbolted.  The leader he had got frightened at the heap o' stones theer,\nan' the others took scare from him.'\r\nWithout a word Harold shook his reins and touched the horse with his\nwhip.  The animal seemed to understand and sprang forward, covering the\nground at a terrific pace.  Harold was not given to alarms, but here\nmight be serious danger.  Three spirited horses in a light cart made for\npace, all bolting in fright, might end any moment in calamity.  Never in\nhis life did he ride faster than on the road to Norling Parva.  Far ahead\nof him he could see at the turn, now and again, a figure running.\nSomething had happened.  His heart grew cold: he knew as well as though","he had seen it, the high cart swaying on one wheel round the corner as\nthe maddened horses tore on their way; the one jerk too much, and the\nmomentary reaction in the crash! . . .\n\nWith beating heart and eyes aflame in his white face he dashed on.\n\nIt was all too true.  By the side of the roadway on the inner curve lay\nthe cart on its side with broken shafts.  The horses were prancing and\nstamping about along the roadway not recovered from their fright.  Each\nwas held by several men.\n\nAnd on the grass two figures were still lying where they had been thrown\r\nout.  Rowly, who had of course been on the off-side, had been thrown\nfurthest.  His head had struck the milestone that stood back on the waste\nground before the ditch.  There was no need for any one to tell that his\nneck had been broken.  The way his head lay on one side, and the twisted,\ninert limbs, all told their story plainly enough.\n\nSquire Norman lay on his back stretched out.  Some one had raised him to\na sitting posture and then lowered him again, straightening his limbs.  He\ndid not therefore look so dreadful as Rowly, but there were signs of\r\ncoming death in the stertorous breathing, the ooze of blood from nostrils\nand ears as well as mouth.  Harold knelt down by him at once and examined\nhim.  Those who were round all knew him and stood back.  He felt the ribs\nand limbs; so far as he could ascertain by touch no bone was broken.\n\nJust then the local doctor, for whom some one had run, arrived in his\ngig.  He, too, knelt beside the injured man, a quick glance having\nsatisfied him that there was only one patient requiring his care.  Harold\nstood up and waited.  The doctor looked up, shaking his head.  Harold\r\ncould hardly suppress the groan which was rising in his throat.  He\nasked:\n\n'Is it immediate?  Should his daughter be brought here?'\n\n'How long would it take her to arrive?'\n\n'Perhaps half an hour; she would not lose an instant.'\n\n'Then you had better send for her.'\n\n'I shall go at once!' answered Harold, turning to jump on his horse,\nwhich was held on the road.\n\n'No, no!' said the doctor, 'send some one else.  You had better stay here\nyourself.  He may become conscious just before the end; and he may want","to say something!'  It seemed to Harold that a great bell was sounding in\nhis ears.--'Before the end!  Good God!  Poor Stephen!' . . . But this was\nno time for sorrow, or for thinking of it.  That would come later.  All\nthat was possible must be done; and to do it required a cool head.  He\ncalled to one of the lads he knew could ride and said to him:\n\n'Get on my horse and ride as fast as you can to Normanstand.  Send at\nonce to Miss Norman and tell her that she is wanted instantly.  Tell her\nthat there has been an accident; that her father is alive, but that she\r\nmust come at once without a moment's delay.  She had better ride my horse\nback as it will save time.  She will understand from that the importance\nof time.  Quick!'\n\nThe lad sprang to the saddle, and was off in a flash.  Whilst Harold was\nspeaking, the doctor had told the men, who, accustomed to hunting\naccidents, had taken a gate from its hinges and held it in readiness, to\nbring it closer.  Then under his direction the Squire was placed on the\ngate.  The nearest house was only about a hundred yards away; and thither\nthey bore him.  He was lifted on a bed, and then the doctor made fuller\r\nexamination.  When he stood up he looked very grave and said to Harold:\n\n'I greatly fear she cannot arrive in time.  That bleeding from the ears\nmeans rupture of the brain.  It is relieving the pressure, however, and\nhe may recover consciousness before he dies.  You had better be close to\nhim.  There is at present nothing that can be done.  If he becomes\nconscious at all it will be suddenly.  He will relapse and probably die\nas quickly.'\n\nAll at once Norman opened his eyes, and seeing him said quietly, as he\nlooked around:\n\n'What place is this, Harold?'\r\n'Martin's--James Martin's, sir.  You were brought here after the\naccident.'\n\n'Yes, I remember!  Am I badly hurt?  I can feel nothing!'\n\n'I fear so, sir!  I have sent for Stephen.'\n\n'Sent for Stephen!  Am I about to die?'  His voice, though feeble, was\ngrave and even.\n\n'Alas! sir, I fear so!'  He sank on his knees as he spoke and took him,\nhis second father, in his arms.\n\n'Is it close?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Then listen to me!  If I don't see Stephen, give her my love and\nblessing!  Say that with my last breath I prayed God to keep her and make","her happy!  You will tell her this?'\n\n'I will!  I will!'  He could hardly speak for the emotion which was\nchoking him.  Then the voice went on, but slower and weaker:\n\n'And Harold, my dear boy, you will look after her, will you not?  Guard\nher and cherish her, as if you were indeed my son and she your sister!'\n\n'I will.  So help me God!'  There was a pause of a few seconds which\nseemed an interminable time.  Then in a feebler voice Squire Norman spoke\nagain:\n\n'And Harold--bend down--I must whisper!  If it should be that in time you\r\nand Stephen should find that there is another affection between you,\nremember that I sanction it--with my dying breath.  But give her time!  I\ntrust that to you!  She is young, and the world is all before her.  Let\nher choose . . . and be loyal to her if it is another!  It may be a hard\ntask, but I trust you, Harold.  God bless you, my other son!'  He rose\nslightly and listened.  Harold's heart leaped.  The swift hoof-strokes of\na galloping horse were heard . . . The father spoke joyously:\n\n'There she is!  That is my brave girl!  God grant that she may be in\r\ntime.  I know what it will mean to her hereafter!'\n\nThe horse stopped suddenly.\n\nA quick patter of feet along the passage and then Stephen half dressed\nwith a peignoir thrown over her, swept into the room.  With the soft\nagility of a leopard she threw herself on her knees beside her father and\nput her arms round him.  The dying man motioned to Harold to raise him.\nWhen this had been done he laid his hand tenderly on his daughter's head,\nsaying:\n\n'Let now, O Lord, Thy servant depart in peace!  God bless and keep you,\r\nmy dear child!  You have been all your life a joy and a delight to me!  I\nshall tell your mother when I meet her all that you have been to me!\nHarold, be good to her!  Good-bye--Stephen! . . . Margaret! . . . '\n\nHis head fell over, and Harold, laying him gently down, knelt beside\nStephen.  He put his arm round her; and she, turning to him, laid her\nhand on his breast and sobbed as though her heart would break.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe bodies of the two squires were brought to Normanstand.  Rowly had\nlong ago said that if he died unmarried he would like to lie beside his","half-sister, and that it was fitting that, as Stephen would be the new\nSquire of Norwood, her dust should in time lie by his.  When the terrible\nnews of her nephew's and of Norman's death came to Norwood, Miss Laetitia\nhurried off to Normanstand as fast as the horses could bring her.\n\nHer coming was an inexpressible comfort to Stephen.  After the first\noverwhelming burst of grief she had settled into an acute despair.  Of\ncourse she had been helped by the fact that Harold had been with her, and\nshe was grateful for that too.  But it did not live in her memory of\r\ngratitude in the same way.  Of course Harold was with her in trouble!  He\nhad always been; would always be.\n\nBut the comfort which Aunt Laetitia could give was of a more positive\nkind.\n\nFrom that hour Miss Rowly stayed at Normanstand.  Stephen wanted her; and\nshe wanted to be with Stephen.\n\nAfter the funeral Harold, with an instinctive delicacy of feeling, had\ngone to live in his own house; but he came to Normanstand every day.\nStephen had so long been accustomed to consulting him about everything\nthat there was no perceptible change in their relations.  Even necessary\r\nbusiness to be done did not come as a new thing.\n\nAnd so things went on outwardly at Normanstand very much as they had done\nbefore the coming of the tragedy.  But for a long time Stephen had\noccasional bursts of grief which to witness was positive anguish to those\nwho loved her.\n\nThen her duty towards her neighbours became a sort of passion.  She did\nnot spare herself by day or by night.  With swift intuition she grasped\nthe needs of any ill case which came before her, and with swift movement\nshe took the remedy in hand.\r\nHer aunt saw and approved.  Stephen, she felt, was in this way truly\nfulfilling her duty as a woman.  The old lady began to secretly hope, and\nalmost to believe, that she had laid aside those theories whose carrying\ninto action she so dreaded.\n\nBut theories do not die so easily.  It is from theory that practice takes\nits real strength, as well as its direction.  And did the older woman\nwhose life had been bound under more orderly restraint but know, Stephen\nwas following out her theories, remorselessly and to the end.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--IN THE SPRING","The months since her father's death spread into the second year before\nStephen began to realise the loneliness of her life.  She had no\ncompanion now but her aunt; and though the old lady adored her, and she\nreturned her love in full, the mere years between them made impossible\nthe companionship that youth craves.  Miss Rowly's life was in the past.\nStephen's was in the future.  And loneliness is a feeling which comes\nunbidden to a heart.\n\nStephen felt her loneliness all round.  In old days Harold was always\nwithin hail, and companionship of equal age and understanding was\r\navailable.  But now his very reticence in her own interest, and by her\nfather's wishes, made for her pain.  Harold had put his strongest\nrestraint on himself, and in his own way suffered a sort of silent\nmartyrdom.  He loved Stephen with every fibre of his being.  Day by day\nhe came toward her with eager step; day by day he left her with a pang\nthat made his heart ache and seemed to turn the brightness of the day to\ngloom.  Night by night he tossed for hours thinking, thinking, wondering\nif the time would ever come when her kisses would be his . . . But the\r\ntortures and terrors of the night had their effect on his days.  It\nseemed as if the mere act of thinking, of longing, gave him ever renewed\nself-control, so that he was able in his bearing to carry out the task he\nhad undertaken: to give Stephen time to choose a mate for herself.  Herein\nlay his weakness--a weakness coming from his want of knowledge of the\nworld of women.  Had he ever had a love affair, be it never so mild a\none, he would have known that love requires a positive expression.  It is\r\nnot sufficient to sigh, and wish, and hope, and long, all to oneself.\nStephen felt instinctively that his guarded speech and manner were due to\nthe coldness--or rather the trusting abated worship--of the brotherhood\nto which she had been always accustomed.  At the time when new forces\nwere manifesting and expanding themselves within her; when her growing\ninstincts, cultivated by the senses and the passions of young nature,\nmade her aware of other forces, new and old, expanding themselves outside\nher; at the time when the heart of a girl is eager for new impressions","and new expansions, and the calls of sex are working within her all\nunconsciously, Harold, to whom her heart would probably have been the\nfirst to turn, made himself in his effort to best show his love, a\n_quantite negligeable_.\n\nThus Stephen, whilst feeling that the vague desires of budding womanhood\nwere trembling within her, had neither thought nor knowledge of their\ncharacter or their ultimate tendency.  She would have been shocked,\nhorrified, had that logical process, which she applied so freely to less\r\npersonal matters, been used upon her own intimate nature.  In her case\nlogic would of course act within a certain range; and as logic is a\nconscious intellectual process, she became aware that her objective was\nman.  Man--in the abstract.  'Man,' not 'a man.'  Beyond that, she could\nnot go.  It is not too much to say that she did not ever, even in her\nmost errant thought, apply her reasoning, or even dream of its following\nout either the duties, the responsibilities, or the consequences of\nhaving a husband.  She had a vague longing for younger companionship, and\r\nof the kind naturally most interesting to her.  There thought stopped.\n\nOne only of her male acquaintances did not at this time appear.  Leonard\nEverard, who had some time ago finished his course at college, was living\npartly in London and partly on the Continent.  His very absence made him\nof added interest to his old play-fellow.  The image of his grace and\ncomeliness, of his dominance and masculine force, early impressed on her\nmind, began to compare favourably with the actualities of her other\nfriends; those of them at least who were within the circle of her\r\npersonal interest.  'Absence makes the heart grow fonder.'  In Stephen's\nmind had been but a very mustard-seed of fondness.  But new lights were\nbreaking for her; and all of them, in greater or lesser degree, shone in\nturn on the memory of the pretty self-willed dominant boy, who now grew\nlarger and more masculine in stature under the instance of each\nsuccessive light.  Stephen knew the others fairly well through and\nthrough.  The usual mixture of good and evil, of strength and weakness,\nof purpose and vacillation, was quite within the scope of her own feeling","and of her observation.  But this man was something of a problem to her;\nand, as such, had a prominence in her thoughts quite beyond his own\nworthiness.\n\nIn movement of some form is life; and even ideas grow when the pulses\nbeat and thought quickens.  Stephen had long had in her mind the idea of\nsexual equality.  For a long time, in deference to her aunt's feelings,\nshe had not spoken of it; for the old lady winced in general under any\nsuggestion of a breach of convention.  But though her outward expression\r\nbeing thus curbed had helped to suppress or minimise the opportunities of\ninward thought, the idea had never left her.  Now, when sex was,\nconsciously or unconsciously, a dominating factor in her thoughts, the\ndormant idea woke to new life.  She had held that if men and women were\nequal the woman should have equal rights and opportunities as the man.  It\nhad been, she believed, an absurd conventional rule that such a thing as\na proposal of marriage should be entirely the prerogative of man.\n\nAnd then came to her, as it ever does to woman, opportunity.  Opportunity,\r\nthe cruelest, most remorseless, most unsparing, subtlest foe that\nwomanhood has.  Here was an opportunity for her to test her own theory;\nto prove to herself, and others, that she was right.  They--'they' being\nthe impersonal opponents of, or unbelievers in, her theory--would see\nthat a woman could propose as well as a man; and that the result would be\ngood.\n\nIt is a part of self-satisfaction, and perhaps not the least dangerous\npart of it, that it has an increasing or multiplying power of its own.\nThe desire to do increases the power to do; and desire and power united\r\nfind new ways for the exercise of strength.  Up to now Stephen's\ninclination towards Leonard had been vague, nebulous; but now that theory\nshowed a way to its utilisation it forthwith began to become, first\ndefinite, then concrete, then substantial.  When once the idea had become\na possibility, the mere passing of time did the rest.\n\nHer aunt saw--and misunderstood.  The lesson of her own youth had not\nbeen applied; not even of those long hours and days and weeks at which\nshe hinted when she had spoken of the tragedy of life which by inference","was her own tragedy: 'to love and to be helpless.  To wait, and wait, and\nwait, with your heart all aflame!'\n\nStephen recognised her aunt's concern for her health in time to protect\nherself from the curiosity of her loving-kindness.  Her youth and\nreadiness and adaptability, and that power of play-acting which we all\nhave within us and of which she had her share, stood to her.  With but\nlittle effort, based on a seeming acquiescence in her aunt's views, she\nsucceeded in convincing the old lady that her incipient feverish cold had\r\nalready reached its crisis and was passing away.  But she had gained\ncertain knowledge in the playing of her little part.  All this\nself-protective instinct was new; for good or ill she had advanced one\nmore step in not only the knowledge but the power of duplicity which is\nso necessary in the conventional life of a woman.\n\nOh! did we but see!  Could we but see!  Here was a woman, dowered in her\nyouth with all the goods and graces in the power of the gods to bestow,\nwho fought against convention; and who yet found in convention the\r\nstrongest as well as the readiest weapon of defence.\n\nFor nearly two weeks Stephen's resolution was held motionless, neither\nadvancing nor receding; it was veritably the slack water of her\nresolution.  She was afraid to go on.  Not afraid in sense of fear as it\nis usually understood, but with the opposition of virginal instincts;\nthose instincts which are natural, but whose uses as well as whose powers\nare unknown to us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--THE RESOLVE\n\n\nThe next few days saw Stephen abnormally restless.  She had fairly well\r\nmade up her mind to test her theory of equality of the sexes by asking\nLeonard Everard to marry her; but her difficulty was as to the doing it.\nShe knew well that it would not do to depend on a chance meeting for an\nopportunity.  After all, the matter was too serious to allow of the\npossibility of levity.  There were times when she thought she would write\nto him and make her proffer of affection in this way; but on every\noccasion when such thought recurred it was forthwith instantly abandoned.\nDuring the last few days, however, she became more reconciled to even","this method of procedure.  The fever of growth was unabated.  At last\ncame an evening which she had all to herself.  Miss Laetitia was going\nover to Norwood to look after matters there, and would remain the night.\nStephen saw in her absence an opportunity for thought and action, and\nsaid that, having a headache, she would remain at home.  Her aunt offered\nto postpone her visit.  But she would not hear of it; and so she had the\nevening to herself.\n\nAfter dinner in her boudoir she set herself to the composition of a\r\nletter to Leonard which would convey at least something of her feelings\nand wishes towards him.  In the depths of her heart, which now and again\nbeat furiously, she had a secret hope that when once the idea was\nbroached Leonard would do the rest.  And as she thought of that 'rest' a\nlanguorous dreaminess came upon her.  She thought how he would come to\nher full of love, of yearning passion; how she would try to keep towards\nhim, at first, an independent front which would preserve her secret\nanxiety until the time should come when she might yield herself to his\r\narms and tell him all.  For hours she wrote letter after letter,\ndestroying them as quickly as she wrote, as she found that she had but\nswayed pendulum fashion between overtness and coldness.  Some of the\nletters were so chilly in tone that she felt they would defeat their own\nobject.  Others were so frankly warm in the expression of--regard she\ncalled it, that with burning blushes she destroyed them at once at the\ncandle before her.\n\nAt last she made up her mind.  Just as she had done when a baby she\nrealised that the opposing forces were too strong for her; she gave in\r\ngracefully.  It would not do to deal directly in a letter with the matter\nin hand.  She would write to Leonard merely asking him to see her.  Then,\nwhen they were together without fear of interruption, she would tell him\nher views.\n\nShe got as far as 'Dear Mr. Leonard,' when she stood up, saying to\nherself:\n\n'I shall not be in a hurry.  I must sleep on it before I write!'  She\ntook up the novel she had been reading in the afternoon, and read on at\nit steadily till her bedtime.\n\nThat night she did not sleep.  It was not that she was agitated.  Indeed,","she was more at ease than she had been for days; she had after much\nanxious thought made up her mind to a definite course of action.\nTherefore her sleeplessness was not painful.  It was rather that she did\nnot want to sleep, than that she could not.  She lay still, thinking,\nthinking; dreaming such dreams as are the occasions of sanctified privacy\nto her age and sex.\n\nIn the morning she was no worse for her vigil.  When at luncheon-time\nAunt Laetitia had returned she went into all the little matters of which\r\nshe had to report.  It was after tea-time when she found herself alone,\nand with leisure to attend to what was, she felt, directly her own\naffair.  During the night she had made up her mind exactly what to say to\nLeonard; and as her specific resolution bore the test of daylight she was\nsatisfied.  The opening words had in their inception caused her some\nconcern; but after hours of thought she had come to the conclusion that\nto address, under the circumstance, the recipient of the letter as 'Dear\nMr. Everard' would hardly do.  The only possible justification of her\r\nunconventional act was that there existed already a friendship, an\nintimacy of years, since childhood; that there were already between them\nknowledge and understanding of each other; that what she was doing, and\nabout to do, was but a further step in a series of events long ago\nundertaken.\n\nShe thought it better to send by post rather than messenger, as the\nlatter did away with all privacy with regard to the act.\n\nThe letter was as follows:\n\n   'DEAR LEONARD,--Would it be convenient for you to meet me to-morrow,\n   Tuesday, at half-past twelve o'clock on the top of Caester Hill?  I\r\nwant to speak about a matter that may have some interest to you, and\n   it will be more private there than in the house.  Also it will be\n   cooler in the shade on the hilltop.--\n\n   Yours sincerely, STEPHEN NORMAN.'\n\nHaving posted the letter she went about the usual routine of her life at\nNormanstand, and no occasion of suspicion or remark regarding her came to\nher aunt.\n\nIn her room that night when she had sent away her maid, she sat down to\nthink, and all the misgivings of the day came back.  One by one they were\nconquered by one protective argument:","'I am free to do as I like.  I am my own mistress; and I am doing nothing\nthat is wrong.  Even if it is unconventional, what of that?  God knows\nthere are enough conventions in the world that are wrong, hopelessly,\nunalterably wrong.  After all, who are the people who are most bound by\nconvention?  Those who call themselves \"smart!\"  If Convention is the god\nof the smart set, then it is about time that honest people chose\nanother!'\n\n* * * * *\n\nLeonard received the letter at breakfast-time.  He did not give it any\r\nspecial attention, as he had other letters at the same time, some of\nwhich were, if less pleasant, of more immediate importance.  He had of\nlate been bombarded with dunning letters from tradesmen; for during his\nUniversity life, and ever since, he had run into debt.  The moderate\nallowance his father made him he had treated as cash for incidental\nexpenses, but everything else had been on credit.  Indeed he was\nbeginning to get seriously alarmed about the future, for his father, who\nhad paid his debts once, and at a time when they were by comparison\r\ninconsiderable, had said that he would not under any circumstances pay\nothers.  He was not sorry, therefore, for an opportunity of getting away\nfor a few hours from home; from himself--from anxieties, possibilities.\nThe morning was a sweltering one, and he grumbled to himself as he set\nout on his journey through the woods.\n\n* * * * *\n\nStephen rose fresh and in good spirits, despite her sleepless night.  When\nyouth and strength are to the fore, a night's sleep is not of much\naccount, for the system once braced up is not allowed to slacken.  It was\r\na notable sign of her strong nature that she was not even impatient, but\nwaited with calm fixity the hour at which she had asked Leonard Everard\nto meet her.  It is true that as the time grew closer her nerve was less\nmarked.  And just before it she was a girl--and nothing more; with all\ngirl's diffidence, a girl's self-distrust, a girl's abnegation, a girl's\nplasticity.\n\nIn the more purely personal aspect of her enterprise Stephen's effort was\nmore conscious.  It is hardly possible for a pretty woman to seek in her\nstudy of perfection the aid of her mirror and to be unconscious of her","aims.  There must certainly be at least one dominant purpose: the\nachievement of success.  Stephen did not attempt to deny her own beauty;\non the contrary she gave it the fullest scope.  There was a certain\ntriumph in her glance as she took her last look in her mirror; a\ngratification of her wish to show herself in the best way possible.  It\nwas a very charming picture which the mirror reflected.\n\nIt may be that there is a companionship in a mirror, especially to a\nwoman; that the reflection of oneself is an emboldening presence, a\r\npersonality which is better than the actuality of an unvalued stranger.\nCertainly, when Stephen closed the door and stood in the wainscoted\npassage, which was only dimly lit by the high window at either end, her\ncourage seemed at once to ooze away.\n\nProbably for the first time in her life, as she left the shade of the\nlong passage and came out on the staircase flooded with the light of the\nnoonday sun, Stephen felt that she was a girl--'girl' standing as some\nsort of synonym for weakness, pretended or actual.  Fear, in whatever\r\nform or degree it may come, is a vital quality and must move.  It cannot\nstand at a fixed point; if it be not sent backward it must progress.\nStephen felt this, and, though her whole nature was repugnant to the\ntask, forced herself to the effort of repression.  It would, she felt,\nhave been to her a delicious pleasure to have abandoned all effort; to\nhave sunk in the lassitude of self-surrender.\n\nThe woman in her was working; her sex had found her out!\n\nShe turned and looked around her, as though conscious of being watched.\nThen, seeing that she was alone, she went her way with settled purpose;\r\nwith flashing eyes and glowing cheeks--and a beating heart.  A heart all\nwoman's since it throbbed the most with apprehension when the enemy, Man,\nwas the objective of her most resolute attack.  She knew that she must\nkeep moving; that she must not stop or pause; or her whole resolution\nmust collapse.  And so she hurried on, fearful lest a chance meeting with\nany one might imperil her purpose.\n\nOn she went through the faint moss-green paths; through meadows rich with\nflowering grasses and the many reds of the summer wild-flowers.  And so","up through the path cut in the natural dipping of the rock that rose over\nCaester Hill and formed a strong base for the clump of great trees that\nmade a landmark for many a mile around.  During the first part of her\njourney between the house and the hilltop, she tried to hold her purpose\nat arm's length; it would be sufficient to face its terrors when the time\nhad come.  In the meantime the matter was of such overwhelming importance\nthat nothing else could take its place; all she could do was to suspend\r\nthe active part of the thinking faculties and leave the mind only\nreceptive.\n\nBut when she had passed through the thin belt of stunted oak and beech\nwhich hedged in the last of the lush meadows, and caught sight of the\nclump of trees on the hilltop, she unconsciously braced herself as a\nyoung regiment loses its tremors when the sight of the enemy breaks upon\nit.  No longer her eyes fell earthward; they were raised, and raised\nproudly.  Stephen Norman was fixed in her intention.  Like the woman of\nold, her feet were on the ploughshares and she would not hesitate.\r\nAs she drew near the appointed place her pace grew slower and slower; the\nwoman in her was unconsciously manifesting itself.  She would not be\nfirst in her tryst with a man.  Unconsciousness, however, is not a\nworking quality which can be relied upon for staying power; the approach\nto the trysting-place brought once more home to her the strange nature of\nher enterprise.  She had made up her mind to it; there was no use in\ndeceiving herself.  What she had undertaken to do was much more\nunconventional than being first at a meeting.  It was foolish and weak to\r\ndelay.  The last thought braced her up; and it was with a hurried gait,\nwhich alone would have betrayed her to an intelligent observer, that she\nentered the grove.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--THE MEETING\n\n\nHad Stephen been better acquainted with men and women, she would have\nbeen more satisfied with herself for being the first at the tryst.  The\nconventional idea, in the minds of most women and of all men, is that a\nwoman should never be the first.  But real women, those in whom the heart\nbeats strong, and whose blood can leap, know better.  These are the","commanders of men.  In them sex calls to sex, all unconsciously at first;\nand men answer to their call, as they to men's.\n\nTwo opposite feelings strove for dominance as Stephen found herself on\nthe hilltop, alone.  One a feeling natural enough to any one, and\nespecially to a girl, of relief that a dreaded hour had been postponed;\nthe other of chagrin that she was the first.\n\nAfter a few moments, however, one of the two militant thoughts became\ndominant: the feeling of chagrin.  With a pang she thought if she had\nbeen a man and summoned for such a purpose, how she would have hurried to\r\nthe trysting-place; how the flying of her feet would have vied with the\nquick rapturous beating of her heart!  With a little sigh and a blush,\nshe remembered that Leonard did not know the purpose of the meeting; that\nhe was a friend almost brought up with her since boy and girl times; that\nhe had often been summoned in similar terms and for the most trivial of\nsocial purposes.\n\nFor nearly half an hour Stephen sat on the rustic seat under the shadow\nof the great oak, looking, half unconscious of its beauty and yet\r\ninfluenced by it, over the wide landscape stretched at her feet.\n\nIn spite of her disregard of conventions, she was no fool; the instinct\nof wisdom was strong within her, so strong that in many ways it ruled her\nconscious efforts.  Had any one told her that her preparations for this\ninterview were made deliberately with some of the astuteness that\ndominated the Devil when he took Jesus to the top of a high mountain and\nshowed him all the kingdoms of the earth at His feet, she would have, and\nwith truth, denied it with indignation.  Nevertheless it was a fact that\r\nshe had, in all unconsciousness, chosen for the meeting a spot which\nwould evidence to a man, consciously or unconsciously, the desirability\nfor his own sake of acquiescence in her views and wishes.  For all this\nspreading landscape was her possession, which her husband would share.  As\nfar as the eye could reach was within the estate which she had inherited\nfrom her father and her uncle.\n\nThe half-hour passed in waiting had in one way its advantages to the\ngirl: though she was still as high strung as ever, she acquired a larger","measure of control over herself.  The nervous tension, however, was so\ncomplete physically that all her faculties were acutely awake; very early\nshe became conscious of a distant footstep.\n\nTo Stephen's straining ears the footsteps seemed wondrous slow, and more\nwondrous regular; she felt instinctively that she would have liked to\nhave listened to a more hurried succession of less evenly-marked sounds.\nBut notwithstanding these thoughts, and the qualms which came in their\nturn, the sound of the coming feet brought great joy.  For, after all,\r\nthey were coming; and coming just in time to prevent the sense of\ndisappointment at their delay gaining firm foothold.  It was only when\nthe coming was assured that she felt how strong had been the undercurrent\nof her apprehension lest they should not come at all.\n\nVery sweet and tender and beautiful Stephen looked at this moment.  The\nstrong lines of her face were softened by the dark fire in her eyes and\nthe feeling which glowed in the deep blushes which mantled her cheeks.\nThe proudness of her bearing was no less marked than ever, but in the\r\nwillowy sway of her body there was a yielding of mere sorry pride.  In\nall the many moods which the gods allow to good women there is none so\ndear or so alluring, consciously as well as instinctively, to true men as\nthis self-surrender.  As Leonard drew near, Stephen sank softly into a\nseat, doing so with a guilty feeling of acting a part.  When he actually\ncame into the grove he found her seemingly lost in a reverie as she gazed\nout over the wide expanse in front of her.  He was hot after his walk,\nand with something very like petulance threw himself into a cane\r\narmchair, exclaiming as he did so with the easy insolence of old\nfamiliarity:\n\n'What a girl you are, Stephen! dragging a fellow all the way up here.\nCouldn't you have fixed it down below somewhere if you wanted to see me?'\n\nStrangely enough, as it seemed to her, Stephen did not dislike his tone\nof mastery.  There was something in it which satisfied her.  The\nunconscious recognition of his manhood, as opposed to her womanhood,\nsoothed her in a peaceful way.  It was easy to yield to a dominant man.\nShe was never more womanly than when she answered him softly:","'It was rather unfair; but I thought you would not mind coming so far.  It\nis so cool and delightful here; and we can talk without being disturbed.'\nLeonard was lying back in his chair fanning himself with his wide-brimmed\nstraw hat, with outstretched legs wide apart and resting on the back of\nhis heels.  He replied with grudging condescension:\n\n'Yes, it's cool enough after the hot tramp over the fields and through\nthe wood.  It's not so good as the house, though, in one way: a man can't\nget a drink here.  I say, Stephen, it wouldn't be half bad if there were\r\na shanty put up here like those at the Grands Mulets or on the\nMatterhorn.  There could be a tap laid on where a fellow could quench his\nthirst on a day like this!'\n\nBefore Stephen's eyes floated a momentary vision of a romantic chalet\nwith wide verandah and big windows looking over the landscape; a great\nwide stone hearth; quaint furniture made from the gnarled branches of\ntrees; skins on the floor; and the walls adorned with antlers, great\nhorns, and various trophies of the chase.  And amongst them Leonard, in a\r\npicturesque suit, lolling back just as at present and smiling with a\nloving look in his eyes as she handed him a great blue-and-white Munich\nbeer mug topped with cool foam.  There was a soft mystery in her voice as\nshe answered:\n\n'Perhaps, Leonard, there will some day be such a place here!'  He seemed\nto grumble as he replied:\n\n'I wish it was here now.  Some day seems a long way off!'\n\nThis seemed a good opening for Stephen; for the fear of the situation was\nagain beginning to assail her, and she felt that if she did not enter on\nher task at once, its difficulty might overwhelm her.  She felt angry\r\nwith herself that there was a change in her voice as she said:\n\n'Some day may mean--can mean everything.  Things needn't be a longer way\noff than we choose ourselves, sometimes!'\n\n'I say, that's a good one!  Do you mean to say that because I am some day\nto own Brindehow I can do as I like with it at once, whilst the\ngovernor's all there, and a better life than I am any day?  Unless you\nwant me to shoot the old man by accident when we go out on the First.'  He\nlaughed a short, unmeaning masculine laugh which jarred somewhat on her.","She did not, however, mean to be diverted from her main purpose, so she\nwent on quickly:\n\n'You know quite well, Leonard, that I don't mean anything of the kind.\nBut there was something I wanted to say to you, and I wished that we\nshould be alone.  Can you not guess what it is?'\n\n'No, I'll be hanged if I can!' was his response, lazily given.\n\nDespite her resolution she turned her head; she could not meet his eyes.\nIt cut her with a sharp pain to notice when she turned again that he was\nnot looking at her.  He continued fanning himself with his hat as he\r\ngazed out at the view.  She felt that the critical moment of her life had\ncome, that it was now or never as to her fulfilling her settled\nintention.  So with a rush she went on her way:\n\n'Leonard, you and I have been friends a long time.  You know my views on\nsome points, and that I think a woman should be as free to act as a man!'\nShe paused; words and ideas did not seem to flow with the readiness she\nexpected.  Leonard's arrogant assurance completed the dragging her back\nto earth which her own self-consciousness began:\r\n'Drive on, old girl!  I know you're a crank from Crankville on some\nsubjects.  Let us have it for all you're worth.  I'm on the grass and\nlistening.'\n\nStephen paused.  'A crank from Crankville!'--this after her nights of\nsleepless anxiety; after the making of the resolution which had cost her\nso much, and which was now actually in process of realisation.  Was it\nall worth so much? why not abandon it now? . . . Abandon it!  Abandon a\nresolution!  All the obstinacy of her nature--she classed it herself as\nfirmness--rose in revolt.  She shook her head angrily, pulled herself\r\ntogether, and went on:\n\n'That may be! though it's not what I call myself, or what I am usually\ncalled, so far as I know.  At any rate my convictions are honest, and I\nam sure you will respect them as such, even if you do not share them.'\nShe did not see the ready response in his face which she expected, and so\nhurried on:\n\n'It has always seemed to me that a--when a woman has to speak to a man\nshe should do so as frankly as she would like him to speak to her, and as\nfreely.  Leonard, I--I,' as she halted, a sudden idea, winged with","possibilities of rescuing procrastination came to her.  She went on more\neasily:\n\n'I know you are in trouble about money matters.  Why not let me help\nyou?'  He sat up and looked at her and said genially:\n\n'Well, Stephen, you are a good old sort!  No mistake about it.  Do you\nmean to say you would help me to pay my debts, when the governor has\nrefused to do so any more?'\n\n'It would be a great pleasure to me, Leonard, to do anything for your\ngood or your pleasure.'\n\nThere was a long pause; they both sat looking down at the ground.  The\r\nwoman's heart beat loud; she feared that the man must hear it.  She was\nconsumed with anxiety, and with a desolating wish to be relieved from the\nstrain of saying more.  Surely, surely Leonard could not be so blind as\nnot to see the state of things! . . . He would surely seize the occasion;\nthrow aside his diffidence and relieve her! . . . His words made a\nmomentary music in her ears as he spoke:\n\n'And is this what you asked me to come here for?'\n\nThe words filled her with a great shame.  She felt herself a dilemma.  It\r\nhad been no part of her purpose to allude his debts.  Viewed in the light\nof what was to follow, it would seem to him that she was trying to\nforeclose his affection.   That could not be allowed to pass; the error\nmust be rectified.  And yet! . . . And yet this very error must be\ncleared up before she could make her full wish apparent.  She seemed to\nfind herself compelled by inexorable circumstances into an unlooked-for\nbluntness.  In any case she must face the situation.  Her pluck did not\nfail her; it was with a very noble and graceful simplicity that she\r\nturned to her companion and said:\n\n'Leonard, I did not quite mean that.  It would be a pleasure to me to be\nof that or any other service to you, if I might be so happy!  But I never\nmeant to allude to your debts.   Oh! Leonard, can't you understand!  If\nyou were my husband--or--or going to be, all such little troubles would\nfall away from you.  But I would not for the world have you think . . . '\n\nHer very voice failed her.  She could not speak what was in her mind; she\nturned away, hiding in her hands her face which fairly seemed to burn.","This, she thought, was the time for a true lover's opportunity!  Oh, if\nshe had been a man, and a woman had so appealed, how he would have sprung\nto her side and taken her in his arms, and in a wild rapture of declared\naffection have swept away all the pain of her shame!\n\nBut she remained alone.  There was no springing to her side; no rapture\nof declared affection; no obliteration of her shame.  She had to bear it\nall alone.  There, in the open; under the eyes that she would fain have\nseen any other phase of her distress.  Her heart beat loud and fast; she\r\nwaited to gain her self-control.\n\nLeonard Everard had his faults, plenty of them, and he was in truth\ncomposed of an amalgam of far baser metals than Stephen thought; but he\nhad been born of gentle blood and reared amongst gentlefolk.  He did not\nquite understand the cause or the amount of his companion's concern; but\nhe could not but recognise her distress.  He realised that it had\nfollowed hard upon her most generous intention towards himself.  He could\nnot, therefore, do less than try to comfort her, and he began his task in\r\na conventional way, but with a blundering awkwardness which was all\nmanlike.  He took her hand and held it in his; this much at any rate he\nhad learned in sitting on stairs or in conservatories after extra dances.\nHe said as tenderly as he could, but with an impatient gesture unseen by\nher:\n\n'Forgive me, Stephen!  I suppose I have said or done something which I\nshouldn't.  But I don't know what it is; upon my honour I don't.  Anyhow,\nI am truly sorry for it.  Cheer up, old girl!  I'm not your husband, you\nknow; so you needn't be distressed.'\r\nStephen took her courage _a deux mains_.  If Leonard would not speak she\nmust.  It was manifestly impossible that the matter could be left in its\npresent state.\n\n'Leonard,' she said softly and solemnly, 'might not that some day be?'\n\nLeonard, in addition to being an egotist and the very incarnation of\nselfishness, was a prig of the first water.  He had been reared\naltogether in convention.  Home life and Eton and Christchurch had taught\nhim many things, wise as well as foolish; but had tended to fix his\nconviction that affairs of the heart should proceed on adamantine lines","of conventional decorum.  It never even occurred to him that a lady could\nso far step from the confines of convention as to take the initiative in\na matter of affection.  In his blind ignorance he blundered brutally.  He\nstruck better than he knew, as, meaning only to pass safely by an awkward\nconversational corner, he replied:\n\n'No jolly fear of that!  You're too much of a boss for me!'  The words\nand the levity with which they were spoken struck the girl as with a\nwhip.  She turned for an instant as pale as ashes; then the red blood\r\nrushed from her heart, and face and neck were dyed crimson.  It was not a\nblush, it was a suffusion.  In his ignorance Leonard thought it was the\nformer, and went on with what he considered his teasing.\n\n'Oh yes!  You know you always want to engineer a chap your own way and\nmake him do just as you wish.  The man who has the happiness of marrying\nyou, Stephen, will have a hard row to hoe!'  His 'chaff' with its utter\nwant of refinement seemed to her, in her high-strung earnest condition,\nnothing short of brutal, and for a few seconds produced a feeling of\r\nrepellence.  But it is in the nature of things that opposition of any\nkind arouses the fighting instinct of a naturally dominant nature.  She\nlost sight of her femininity in the pursuit of her purpose; and as this\nwas to win the man to her way of thinking, she took the logical course of\nanswering his argument.  If Leonard Everard had purposely set himself to\nstimulate her efforts in this direction he could hardly have chosen a\nbetter way.  It came somewhat as a surprise to Stephen, when she heard\nher own words:\r\n'I would make a good wife, Leonard!  A husband whom I loved and honoured\nwould, I think, not be unhappy!'  The sound of her own voice speaking\nthese words, though the tone was low and tender and more self-suppressing\nby far than was her wont, seemed to peal like thunder in her own ears.\nHer last bolt seemed to have sped.  The blood rushed to her head, and she\nhad to hold on to the arms of the rustic chair or she would have fallen\nforward.\n\nThe time seemed long before Leonard spoke again; every second seemed an\nage.  She seemed to have grown tired of waiting for the sound of his","voice; it was with a kind of surprise that she heard him say:\n\n'You limit yourself wisely, Stephen!'\n\n'How do you mean?' she asked, making a great effort to speak.\n\n'You would promise to love and honour; but there isn't anything about\nobeying.'\n\nAs he spoke Leonard stretched himself again luxuriously, and laughed with\nthe intellectual arrogance of a man who is satisfied with a joke, however\ninferior, of his own manufacture.  Stephen looked at him with a long look\nwhich began in anger--that anger which comes from an unwonted sense of\r\nimpotence, and ends in tolerance, the intermediate step being admiration.\nIt is the primeval curse that a woman's choice is to her husband; and it\nis an important part of the teaching of a British gentlewoman, knit in\nthe very fibres of her being by the remorseless etiquette of a thousand\nyears, that she be true to him.  The man who has in his person the\nnecessary powers or graces to evoke admiration in his wife, even for a\npassing moment, has a stronghold unconquerable as a rule by all the\ndeadliest arts of mankind.\n\nLeonard Everard was certainly good to look upon as he lolled at his ease\r\non that summer morning.  Tall, straight, supple; a typical British\ngentleman of the educated class, with all parts of the body properly\ndeveloped and held in some kind of suitable poise.\n\nAs Stephen looked, the anxiety and chagrin which tormented her seemed to\npass.  She realised that here was a nature different from her own, and\nwhich should be dealt with in a way unsuitable to herself; and the\nconviction seemed to make the action which it necessitated more easy as\nwell as more natural to her.  Perhaps for the first time in her life\r\nStephen understood that it may be necessary to apply to individuals a\nstandard of criticism unsuitable to self-judgment.  Her recognition might\nhave been summed up in the thought which ran through her mind:\n\n'One must be a little lenient with a man one loves!'\n\nStephen, when once she had allowed the spirit of toleration to work\nwithin her, felt immediately its calming influence.  It was with brighter\nthoughts and better humour that she went on with her task.  A task only,\nit seemed now; a means to an end which she desired.","'Leonard, tell me seriously, why do you think I gave you the trouble of\ncoming out here?'\n\n'Upon my soul, Stephen, I don't know.'\n\n'You don't seem to care either, lolling like that when I am serious!'  The\nwords were acid, but the tone was soft and friendly, familiar and\ngenuine, putting quite a meaning of its own on them.  Leonard looked at\nher indolently:\n\n'I like to loll.'\n\n'But can't you even guess, or try to guess, what I ask you?'\n\n'I can't guess.  The day's too hot, and that shanty with the drinks is\nnot built yet.'\r\n'Or may never be!'  Again he looked at her sleepily.\n\n'Never be!  Why not?'\n\n'Because, Leonard, it may depend on you.'\n\n'All right then.  Drive on!  Hurry up the architect and the\njerry-builder!'\n\nA quick blush leaped to Stephen's cheeks.  The words were full of\nmeaning, though the tone lacked something; but the news was too good.  She\ncould not accept it at once; she decided to herself to wait a short time.\nEre many seconds had passed she rejoiced that she had done so as he went\non:\n\n'I hope you'll give me a say before that husband of yours comes along.  He\r\nmight be a blue-ribbonite; and it wouldn't do to start such a shanty for\nrot-gut!'\n\nAgain a cold wave swept over her.  The absolute difference of feeling\nbetween the man and herself; his levity against her earnestness, his\ncallous blindness to her purpose, even the commonness of his words\nchilled her.  For a few seconds she wavered again in her intention; but\nonce again his comeliness and her own obstinacy joined hands and took her\nback to her path.  With chagrin she felt that her words almost stuck in\nher throat, as summoning up all her resolution she went on:\r\n'It would be for you I would have it built, Leonard!'  The man sat up\nquickly.\n\n'For me?' he asked in a sort of wonderment.\n\n'Yes, Leonard, for you and me!'  She turned away; her blushes so overcame\nher that she could not look at him.  When she faced round again he was\nstanding up, his back towards her.\n\nShe stood up also.  He was silent for a while; so long that the silence\nbecame intolerable, and she spoke:\n\n'Leonard, I am waiting!'  He turned round and said slowly, the absence of\nall emotion from his face chilling her till her face blanched:","'I don't think I would worry about it!'\n\nStephen Norman was plucky, and when she was face to face with any\ndifficulty she was all herself.  Leonard did not look pleasant; his face\nwas hard and there was just a suspicion of anger.  Strangely enough, this\nlast made the next step easier to the girl; she said slowly:\n\n'All right!  I think I understand!'\n\nHe turned from her and stood looking out on the distant prospect.  Then\nshe felt that the blow which she had all along secretly feared had fallen\non her.  But her pride as well as her obstinacy now rebelled.  She would\r\nnot accept a silent answer.  There must be no doubt left to torture her\nafterwards.  She would take care that there was no mistake.  Schooling\nherself to her task, and pressing one hand for a moment to her side as\nthough to repress the beating of her heart, she came behind him and\ntouched him tenderly on the arm.\n\n'Leonard,' she said softly, 'are you sure there is no mistake?  Do you\nnot see that I am asking you,' she intended to say 'to be my husband,'\nbut she could not utter the words, they seemed to stick in her mouth, so\r\nshe finished the sentence: 'that I be your wife?'\n\nThe moment the words were spoken--the bare, hard, naked, shameless\nwords--the revulsion came.  As a lightning flash shows up the blackness\nof the night the appalling truth of what she had done was forced upon\nher.  The blood rushed to her head till cheeks and shoulders and neck\nseemed to burn.  Covering her face with her hands she sank back on the\nseat crying silently bitter tears that seemed to scald her eyes and her\ncheeks as they ran.\n\nLeonard was angry.  When it began to dawn upon him what was the purpose\r\nof Stephen's speech, he had been shocked.  Young men are so easily\nshocked by breaches of convention made by women they respect!  And his\npride was hurt.  Why should he have been placed in such a ridiculous\nposition!  He did not love Stephen in that way; and she should have known\nit.  He liked her and all that sort of thing; but what right had she to\nassume that he loved her?  All the weakness of his moral nature came out\nin his petulance.  It was boyish that his eyes filled with tears.  He\nknew it, and that made him more angry than ever.  Stephen might well have","been at a loss to understand his anger, as, with manifest intention to\nwound, he answered her:\n\n'What a girl you are, Stephen.  You are always doing something or other\nto put a chap in the wrong and make him ridiculous.  I thought you were\njoking--not a good joke either!  Upon my soul, I don't know what I've\ndone that you should fix on me!  I wish to goodness--'\n\nIf Stephen had suffered the red terror before, she suffered the white\nterror now.  It was not injured pride, it was not humiliation, it was not\r\nfear; it was something vague and terrible that lay far deeper than any of\nthese.  Under ordinary circumstances she would have liked to have spoken\nout her mind and given back as good as she got; and even as the thoughts\nwhirled through her brain they came in a torrent of vague vituperative\neloquence.  But now her tongue was tied.  Instinctively she knew that she\nhad put it out of her power to revenge, or even to defend herself.  She\nwas tied to the stake, and must suffer without effort and in silence.\n\nMost humiliating of all was the thought that she must propitiate the man\r\nwho had so wounded her.  All love for him had in the instant passed from\nher; or rather she realised fully the blank, bare truth that she had\nnever really loved him at all.  Had she really loved him, even a blow at\nhis hands would have been acceptable; but now . . .\n\nShe shook the feelings and thoughts from her as a bird does the water\nfrom its wings; and, with the courage and strength and adaptability of\nher nature, addressed herself to the hard task which faced her in the\nimmediate present.  With eloquent, womanly gesture she arrested the\r\ntorrent of Leonard's indignation; and, as he paused in surprised\nobedience, she said:\n\n'That will do, Leonard!  It is not necessary to say any more; and I am\nsure you will see, later on, that at least there was no cause for your\nindignation!  I have done an unconventional thing, I know; and I dare say\nI shall have to pay for it in humiliating bitterness of thought later on!\nBut please remember we are all alone!  This is a secret between us; no\none else need ever know or suspect it!'\n\nShe rose as she concluded.  The quiet dignity of her speech and bearing","brought back Leonard in some way to his sense of duty as a gentleman.  He\nbegan, in a sheepish way, to make an apology:\n\n'I'm sure I beg your pardon, Stephen.'  But again she held the warning\nhand:\n\n'There is no need for pardon; the fault, if there were any, was mine\nalone.  It was I, remember, who asked you to come here and who introduced\nand conducted this melancholy business.  I have asked you several things,\nLeonard, and one more I will add--'tis only one: that you will forget!'\n\nAs she moved away, her dismissal of the subject was that of an empress to\r\na serf.  Leonard would have liked to answer her; to have given vent to\nhis indignation that, even when he had refused her offer, she should have\nthe power to treat him if he was the one refused, and to make him feel\nsmall and ridiculous in his own eyes.  But somehow he felt constrained to\nsilence; her simple dignity outclassed him.\n\nThere was another factor too, in his forming his conclusion of silence.\nHe had never seen Stephen look so well, or so attractive.  He had never\nrespected her so much as when her playfulness had turned to majestic\r\ngravity.  All the boy and girl strife of the years that had gone seemed\nto have passed away.  The girl whom he had played with, and bullied, and\ntreated as frankly as though she had been a boy, had in an instant become\na woman--and such a woman as demanded respect and admiration even from\nsuch a man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII--ON THE ROAD HOME\n\n\nWhen Leonard Everard parted from Stephen he did so with a feeling of\ndissatisfaction: firstly, with Stephen; secondly, with things in general;\nthirdly, with himself.  The first was definite, concrete, and immediate;\r\nhe could give himself chapter and verse for all the girl's misdoing.\nEverything she had said or done had touched some nerve painfully, or had\noffended his feelings; and to a man of his temperament his feelings are\nvery sacred things, to himself.\n\n'Why had she put him in such a ridiculous position?  That was the worst\nof women.  They were always wanting him to do something he didn't want to\ndo, or crying . . . there was that girl at Oxford.'\n\nHere he turned his head slowly, and looked round in a furtive way, which","was getting almost a habit with him.  'A fellow should go away so that he\nwouldn't have to swear lies.  Women were always wanting money; or worse:\nto be married!  Confound women; they all seemed to want him to marry\nthem!  There was the Oxford girl, and then the Spaniard, and now\nStephen!'  This put his thoughts in a new channel.  He wanted money\nhimself.  Why, Stephen had spoken of it herself; had offered to pay his\ndebts.  Gad! it was a good idea that every one round the countryside\nseemed to know his affairs.  What a flat he had been not to accept her\r\noffer then and there before matters had gone further.  Stephen had lots\nof money, more than any girl could want.  But she didn't give him time to\nget the thing fixed . . . If he had only known beforehand what she wanted\nhe could have come prepared . . . that was the way with women!  Always\nthinking of themselves!  And now?  Of course she wouldn't stump up after\nhis refusing her.  What would his father say if he came to hear of it?\nAnd he must speak to him soon, for these chaps were threatening to County\nCourt him if he didn't pay.  Those harpies in Vere Street were quite\r\nnasty . . . '  He wondered if he could work Stephen for a loan.\n\nHe walked on through the woodland path, his pace slower than before.  'How\npretty she had looked!'  Here he touched his little moustache.  'Gad!\nStephen was a fine girl anyhow!  If it wasn't for all that red hair . . .\nI like 'em dark better! . . . And her being such an infernal boss!'. . .\nThen he said unconsciously aloud:\n\n'If I was her husband I'd keep her to rights!'\n\nPoor Stephen!\n\n'So that's what the governor meant by telling me that fortune was to be\r\nhad, and had easily, if a man wasn't a blind fool.  The governor is a\nstarchy old party.  He wouldn't speak out straight and say, \"Here's\nStephen Norman, the richest girl you are ever likely to meet; why don't\nyou make up to her and marry her?\"  But that would be encouraging his son\nto be a fortune-hunter!  Rot! . . . And now, just because she didn't tell\nme what she wanted to speak about, or the governor didn't give me a hint\nso that I might be prepared, I have gone and thrown away the chance.\nAfter all it mightn't be so bad.  Stephen is a fine girl! . . . But she","mustn't ever look at me as she did when I spoke about her not obeying.  I\nmean to be master in my own house anyhow!\n\n'A man mustn't be tied down too tight, even if he is married.  And if\nthere's plenty of loose cash about it isn't hard to cover up your tracks\n. . . I think I'd better think this thing over calmly and be ready when\nStephen comes at me again.  That's the way with women.  When a woman like\nStephen fixes her cold grey on a man she does not mean to go asleep over\nit.  I daresay my best plan will be to sit tight, and let her work\r\nherself up a bit.  There's nothing like a little wholesome neglect for\nbringing a girl to her bearings!' . . .\n\nFor a while he walked on in satisfied self-complacency.\n\n'Confound her! why couldn't she have let me know that she was fond of me\nin some decent way, without all that formal theatrical proposing?  It's a\ndeuced annoying thing in the long run the way the women get fond of me.\nThough it's nice enough in some ways while it lasts!' he added, as if in\nunwilling recognition of fact.  As the path debouched on the highroad he\nsaid to himself half aloud:\r\n'Well, she's a mighty fine girl, anyhow!  And if she is red I've had\nabout enough of the black! . . . That Spanish girl is beginning to kick\ntoo!  I wish I had never come across . . . '\n\n'Shut up, you fool!' he said to himself as he walked on.\n\nWhen he got home he found a letter from his father.  He took it to his\nroom before breaking the seal.  It was at least concise and to the point:\n\n   'The enclosed has been sent to me.  You will have to deal with it\n   yourself.  You know my opinion and also my intention.   The items\r\nwhich I have marked have been incurred since I spoke to you last about\n   your debts.  I shall not pay another farthing for you.  So take your\n   own course!\n\n   'JASPER EVERARD.'\n\nThe enclosed was a jeweller's bill, the length and the total of which\nlengthened his face and drew from him a low whistle.   He held it in his\nhand for a long time, standing quite still and silent.  Then drawing a\ndeep breath he said aloud:\n\n'That settles it!  The halter is on me!  It's no use squealing.  If it's\nto be a red head on my pillow! . . . All right!  I must only make the","best of it.  Anyhow I'll have a good time to-day, even if it must be the\nlast!'\n\nThat day Harold was in Norcester on business.  It was late when he went\nto the club to dine.  Whilst waiting for dinner he met Leonard Everard,\nflushed and somewhat at uncertain in his speech.  It was something of a\nshock to Harold to see him in such a state.\n\nLeonard was, however, an old friend, and man is as a rule faithful to\nfriends in this form of distress.  So in his kindly feeling Harold\noffered to drive him home, for he knew that he could thus keep him out of\r\nfurther harm.  Leonard thanked him in uncertain speech, and said he would\nbe ready.  In the meantime he would go and play billiards with the marker\nwhilst Harold was having his dinner.\n\nAt ten o'clock Harold's dogcart was ready and he went to look for\nLeonard, who had not since come near him.  He found him half asleep in\nthe smoking-room, much drunker than he had been earlier in the evening.\n\nThe drive was fairly long, so Harold made up his mind for a prolonged\nterm of uneasiness and anxiety.  The cool night-air, whose effect was\r\nincreased by the rapid motion, soon increased Leonard's somnolence and\nfor a while he slept soundly, his companion watching carefully lest he\nshould sway over and fall out of the trap.  He even held him up as they\nswung round sharp corners.\n\nAfter a time he woke up, and woke in a nasty temper.  He began to find\nfault in an incoherent way with everything.  Harold said little, just\nenough to prevent any cause for further grievance.  Then Leonard changed\nand became affectionate.  This mood was a greater bore than the other,\r\nbut Harold managed to bear it with stolid indifference.  Leonard was this\nby time making promises to do things for him, that as he was what he\ncalled a 'goo' fell',' he might count on his help and support in the\nfuture.  As Harold knew him to be a wastrel, over head and ears in debt\nand with only the succession to a small estate, he did not take much heed\nto his maunderings.  At last the drunken man said something which\nstartled him so much that he instinctively drew himself together with\nsuch suddenness as to frighten the horse and almost make him rear up\nstraight.","'Woa!  Woa!  Steady, boy.  Gently!' he said, quieting him.  Then turning\nto his companion said in a voice hollow with emotion and vibrant with\nsuppressed passion:\n\n'What was it you said?'\n\nLeonard, half awake, and not half of that half master of himself,\nanswered:\n\n'I said I will make you agent of Normanstand when I marry Stephen.'\n\nHarold grew cold.  To hear of any one marrying Stephen was to him like\nplunging him in a glacier stream; but to hear her name so lightly spoken,\nand by such a man, was a bewildering shock which within a second set his\r\nblood on fire.\n\n'What do you mean?' he thundered.  'You marry Ste . . . Miss Norman!\nYou're not worthy to untie her shoe!  You indeed!  She wouldn't look on\nthe same side of the street with a drunken brute like you!  How dare you\nspeak of her in such a way!'\n\n'Brute!' said Leonard angrily, his vanity reaching inward to heart and\nbrain through all the numbing obstacle of his drunken flesh.  'Who's\nbrute?  Brute yourself!  Tell you goin' to marry Stephen, 'cos Stephen\nwants it.  Stephen loves me.  Loves me with all her red head!  Wha're you\ndoin'!  Wha!!'\r\nHis words merged in a lessening gurgle, for Harold had now got him by the\nthroat.\n\n'Take care what you say about that lady! damn you!' he said, putting his\nface close the other's with eyes that blazed.  'Don't you dare to mention\nher name in such a way, or you will regret it longer than you can think.\nLoves you, you swine!'\n\nThe struggle and the fierce grip on his throat sobered Leonard somewhat.\nMomentarily sobbed him to that point when he could be coherent and\nvindictive, though not to the point where he could think ahead.  Caution,\r\nwisdom, discretion, taste, were not for him at such a moment.  Guarding\nhis throat with both hands in an instinctive and spasmodic manner he\nanswered the challenge:\n\n'Who are you calling swine?  I tell you she loves me.  She ought to know.\nDidn't she tell me so this very day!'  Harold drew back his arm to strike\nhim in the face, his anger too great for words.  But the other, seeing\nthe motion and in the sobering recognition of danger, spoke hastily:\n\n'Keep your hair on!  You know so jolly much more than I do.  I tell you\nthat she told me this and a lot more this morning when she asked me to","marry her.'\n\nHarold's heart grew cold as ice.  There is something in the sound of a\nvoice speaking truthfully which a true man can recognise.  Through all\nLeonard's half-drunken utterings came such a ring of truth; and Harold\nrecognised it.  He felt that his voice was weak and hollow as he spoke,\nthinking it necessary to give at first a sort of official denial to such\na monstrous statement:\n\n'Liar!'\n\n'I'm no liar!' answered Leonard.  He would like to have struck him in\nanswer to such a word had he felt equal to it.  'She asked me to marry\r\nher to-day on the hill above the house, where I went to meet her by\nappointment.  Here!  I'll prove it to you.  Read this!'  Whilst he was\nspeaking he had opened the greatcoat and was fumbling in the\nbreast-pocket of his coat.  He produced a letter which he handed to\nHarold, who took it with trembling hand.  By this time the reins had\nfallen slack and the horse was walking quietly.  There was moonlight, but\nnot enough to read by.  Harold bent over and lifted the driving-lamp next\nto him and turned it so that he could read the envelope.  He could hardly\r\nkeep either lamp or paper still, his hand trembled so when he saw that\nthe direction was in Stephen's handwriting.  He was handing it back when\nLeonard said again:\n\n'Open it!  Read it!  You must do so; I tell you, you must!  You called me\na liar, and now must read the proof that I am not.  If you don't I shall\nhave to ask Stephen to make you!'  Before Harold's mind flashed a rapid\nthought of what the girl might suffer in being asked to take part in such\na quarrel.  He could not himself even act to the best advantage unless he\r\nknew the truth . . . he took the letter from the envelope and held it\nbefore the lamp, the paper fluttering as though in a breeze from the\ntrembling of his hand.  Leonard looked on, the dull glare of his eyes\nbrightening with malignant pleasure as he beheld the other's concern.  He\nowed him a grudge, and by God he would pay it.  Had he not been\nstruck--throttled--called a liar! . . .\n\nAs he read the words Harold's face cleared.  'Why, you infernal young\nscoundrel!' he said angrily, 'that letter is nothing but a simple note\nfrom a young girl to an old friend--playmate asking him to come to see","her about some trivial thing.  And you construe it into a proposal of\nmarriage.  You hound!'  He held the letter whilst he spoke, heedless of\nthe outstretched hand of the other waiting to take it back.  There was a\ndangerous glitter in Leonard's eyes.  He knew his man and he knew the\ntruth of what he had himself said, and he felt, with all the strength of\nhis base soul, how best he could torture him.  In the very strength of\nHarold's anger, in the poignancy of his concern, in the relief to his\nsoul expressed in his eyes and his voice, his antagonist realised the\r\njealousy of one who honours--and loves.  Second by second Leonard grew\nmore sober, and more and better able to carry his own idea into act.\n\n'Give me my letter!' he began.\n\n'Wait!' said Harold as he put the lamp back into its socket.  'That will\ndo presently.  Take back what you said just now!'\n\n'What?  Take back what?'\n\n'That base lie; that Miss Norman asked you to marry her.'\n\nLeonard felt that in a physical struggle for the possession of the letter\nhe would be outmatched; but his passion grew colder and more malignant,\r\nand in a voice that cut like the hiss of a snake he spoke slowly and\ndeliberately.  He was all sober now; the drunkenness of brain and blood\nwas lost, for the time, in the strength of his cold passion.\n\n'It is true.  By God it is true; every word of it!  That letter, which\nyou want to steal, is only a proof that I went to meet her on Caester\nHill by her own appointment.  When I got there, she was waiting for me.\nShe began to talk about a chalet there, and at first I didn't know what\nshe meant--'\n\nThere was such conviction, such a triumphant truth in his voice, that\r\nHarold was convinced.\n\n'Stop!' he thundered; 'stop, don't tell me anything.  I don't want to\nhear.  I don't want to know.'  He covered his face with his hands and\ngroaned.  It was not as though the speaker were a stranger, in which case\nhe would have been by now well on in his death by strangulation; he had\nknown Leonard all his life, and he was a friend of Stephen's.  And he was\nspeaking truth.\n\nThe baleful glitter of Leonard's eyes grew brighter still.  He was as a\nserpent when he goes to strike.  In this wise he struck.","'I shall not stop.  I shall go on and tell you all I choose.  You have\ncalled me liar--twice.  You have also called me other names.  Now you\nshall hear the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  And if\nyou won't listen to me some one else will.'  Harold groaned again;\nLeonard's eyes brightened still more, and the evil smile on his face grew\nbroader as he began more and more to feel his power.  He went on to speak\nwith a cold deliberate malignancy, but instinctively so sticking to\nabsolute truth that he could trust himself to hurt most.  The other\r\nlistened, cold at heart and physically; his veins and arteries seemed\nstagnant.\n\n'I won't tell you anything of her pretty embarrassments; how her voice\nfell as she pleaded; how she blushed and stammered.  Why, even I, who am\nused to women and their pretty ways and their passions and their\nflushings and their stormy upbraidings, didn't quite know for a while\nwhat she was driving at.  So at last she spoke out pretty plainly, and\ntold me what a fond wife she'd make me if I would only take her!'  Harold\r\nsaid nothing; he only rocked a little as one in pain, and his hands fell.\nThe other went on:\n\n'That is what happened this morning on Caester Hill under the trees where\nI met Stephen Norman by her own appointment; honestly what happened.  If\nyou don't believe me now you can ask Stephen.  My Stephen!' he added in a\nfinal burst of venom as in a gleam of moonlight through a rift in the\nshadowy wood he saw the ghastly pallor of Harold's face.  Then he added\nabruptly as he held out his hand:\n\n'Now give me my letter!'\n\nIn the last few seconds Harold had been thinking.  And as he had been\r\nthinking for the good, the safety, of Stephen, his thoughts flew swift\nand true.  This man's very tone, the openness of his malignity, the\nunderlying scorn when he spoke of her whom others worshipped, showed him\nthe danger--the terrible immediate danger in which she stood from such a\nman.  With the instinct of a mind working as truly for the woman he loved\nas the needle does to the Pole he spoke quietly, throwing a sneer into\nthe tone so as to exasperate his companion--it was brain against brain\nnow, and for Stephen's sake:","'And of course you accepted.  You naturally would!'  The other fell into\nthe trap.  He could not help giving an extra dig to his opponent by\nproving him once more in the wrong.\n\n'Oh no, I didn't!  Stephen is a fine girl; but she wants taking down a\nbit.  She's too high and mighty just at present, and wants to boss a chap\ntoo much.  I mean to be master in my own house; and she's got to begin as\nshe will have to go on.  I'll let her wait a bit: and then I'll yield by\ndegrees to her lovemaking.  She's a fine girl, for all her red head; and\nshe won't be so bad after all!'\r\nHarold listened, chilled into still and silent amazement.  To hear\nStephen spoken of in such a way appalled him.  She of all women! . . .\nLeonard never knew how near sudden death he was, as he lay back in his\nseat, his eyes getting dull again and his chin sinking.  The drunkenness\nwhich had been arrested by his passion was reasserting itself.  Harold\nsaw his state in time and arrested his own movement to take him by the\nthroat and dash him to the ground.  Even as he looked at him in scornful\nhate, the cart gave a lurch and Leonard fell forward.  Instinctively\r\nHarold swept an arm round him and held him up.  As he did so the\nunconsciousness of arrested sleep came; Leonard's chin sank on his breast\nand he breathed stertorously.\n\nAs he drove on, Harold's thoughts circled in a tumult.  Vague ideas of\nextreme measures which he ought to take flashed up and paled away.\nIntention revolved upon itself till its weak side was exposed, and, it\nwas abandoned.  He could not doubt the essential truth of Leonard's\nstatement regarding the proposal of marriage.  He did not understand this\r\nnor did he try to.  His own love for the girl and the bitter awaking to\nits futility made him so hopeless that in his own desolation all the\nmystery of her doing and the cause of it was merged and lost.\n\nHis only aim and purpose now was her safety.  One thing at least he could\ndo: by fair means or foul stop Leonard's mouth, so that others need not\nknow her shame!  He groaned aloud as the thought came to him.  Beyond\nthis first step he could do nothing, think of nothing as yet.  And he\ncould not take this first step till Leonard had so far sobered that he","could understand.\n\nAnd so waiting for that time to come, he drove on through the silent\nnight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII--HAROLD'S RESOLVE\n\n\nAs they went on their way Harold noticed that Leonard's breathing became\nmore regular, as in honest sleep.  He therefore drove slowly so that the\nother might be sane again before they should arrive at the gate of his\nfather's place; he had something of importance to say before they should\npart.\n\nSeeing him sleeping so peacefully, Harold passed a strap round him to\nprevent him falling from his seat.  Then he could let his thoughts run\r\nmore freely.  Her safety was his immediate concern; again and again he\nthought over what he should say to Leonard to ensure his silence.\n\nWhilst he was pondering with set brows, he was startled by Leonard's\nvoice at his side:\n\n'Is that you, Harold?  I must have been asleep!'  Harold remained silent,\namazed at the change.  Leonard went on, quite awake and coherent:\n\n'By George!  I must have been pretty well cut.  I don't remember a thing\nafter coming down the stairs of the club and you and the hall-porter\r\nhelping me up here.  I say, old chap, you have strapped me up all safe\nand tight.  It was good of you to take charge of me.  I hope I haven't\nbeen a beastly nuisance!'  Harold answered grimly:\n\n'It wasn't exactly what I should have called it!'  Then, after looking\nkeenly at his companion, he said: 'Are you quite awake and sober now?'\n\n'Quite.'  The answer came defiantly; there was something in his\nquestioner's tone which was militant and aggressive.  Before speaking\nfurther Harold pulled up the horse.  They were now crossing bare\r\nmoorland, where anything within a mile could have easily been seen.  They\nwere quite alone, and would be undisturbed.  Then he turned to his\ncompanion.\n\n'You talked a good deal in your drunken sleep--if sleep it was.  You\nappeared to be awake!'  Leonard answered:\n\n'I don't remember anything of it.  What did I say?'\n\n'I am going to tell you.  You said something so strange and so wrong that\nyou must answer for it.  But first I must know its truth.'\n\n'Must!  You are pretty dictatorial,' said Leonard angrily.  'Must answer\nfor it!  What do you mean?'\n\n'Were you on Caester Hill to-day?'","'What's that to you?'  There was no mistaking the defiant, quarrelsome\nintent.\n\n'Answer me! were you?'  Harold's voice was strong and calm.\n\n'What if I was?  It is none of your affair.  Did I say anything in what\nyou have politely called my drunken sleep?'\n\n'You did.'\n\n'What did I say?'\n\n'I shall tell you in time.  But I must know the truth as I proceed.  There\nis some one else concerned in this, and I must know as I go on.  You can\neasily judge by what I say if I am right.'\n\n'Then ask away and be damned to you!'  Harold's calm voice seemed to\r\nquell the other's turbulence as he went on:\n\n'Were you on Caester Hill this morning?'\n\n'I was.'\n\n'Did you meet Miss --- a lady there?'\n\n'What . . . I did!'\n\n'Was it by appointment?'  Some sort of idea or half-recollection seemed\nto come to Leonard; he fumbled half consciously in his breast-pocket.\nThen he broke out angrily:\n\n'You have taken my letter!'\n\n'I know the answer to that question,' said Harold slowly.  'You showed me\nthe letter yourself, and insisted on my reading it.'  Leonard's heart\nbegan to quail.  He seemed to have an instinctive dread of what was\r\ncoming.  Harold went on calmly and remorselessly:\n\n'Did a proposal of marriage pass between you?'\n\n'Yes!'  The answer was defiantly given; Leonard began to feel that his\nback was against the wall.\n\n'Who made it?'  The answer was a sudden attempt at a blow, but Harold\nstruck down his hand in time and held it.  Leonard, though a fairly\nstrong man, was powerless in that iron grasp.\n\n'You must answer!  It is necessary that I know the truth.'\n\n'Why must you?  What have you to do with it?  You are not my keeper!  Nor\r\nStephen's; though I dare say you would like to be!'  The insult cooled\nHarold's rising passion, even whilst it wrung his heart.\n\n'I have to do with it because I choose.  You may find the answer if you\nwish in your last insult!  Now, clearly understand me, Leonard Everard.\nYou know me of old; and you know that what I say I shall do.  One way or\nanother, your life or mine may hang on your answers to me--if necessary!'\nLeonard felt himself pulled up.  He knew well the strength and purpose of\nthe man.  With a light laugh, which he felt to be, as it was, hollow, he\nanswered:","'Well, schoolmaster, as you are asking questions, I suppose I may as well\nanswer them.  Go on!  Next!'  Harold went on in the same calm, cold\nvoice:\n\n'Who made the proposal of marriage?'\n\n'She did.'\n\n'Did . . . Was it made at once and directly, or after some preliminary\nsuggestion?'\n\n'After a bit.  I didn't quite understand at first what she was driving\nat.'  There was a long pause.  With an effort Harold went on:\n\n'Did you accept?'  Leonard hesitated.  With a really wicked scowl he eyed\nhis big, powerfully-built companion, who still had his hand as in a vice.\r\nThen seeing no resource, he answered:\n\n'I did not!  That does not mean that I won't, though!' he added\ndefiantly.  To his surprise Harold suddenly released his hand.  There was\na grimness in his tone as he said:\n\n'That will do!  I know now that you have spoken the truth, sober as well\nas drunk.  You need say no more.  I know the rest.  Most men--even brutes\nlike you, if there are any--would have been ashamed even to think the\nthings you said, said openly to me, you hound.  You vile, traitorous,\nmean-souled hound!'\n\n'What did I say?'\r\n'I know what you said; and I shall not forget it.'  He went on, his voice\ndeepening into a stern judicial utterance, as though he were pronouncing\na sentence of death:\n\n'Leonard Everard, you have treated vilely a lady whom I love and honour\nmore than I love my own soul.  You have insulted her to her face and\nbehind her back.  You have made such disloyal reference to her and to her\nmad act in so trusting you, and have so shown your intention of causing,\nintentionally or unintentionally, woe to her, that I tell you here and\r\nnow that you hold henceforth your life in your hand.  If you ever mention\nto a living soul what you have told me twice to-night, even though you\nshould be then her husband; if you should cause her harm though she\nshould then be your wife; if you should cause her dishonour in public or\nin private, I shall kill you.  So help me God!'\n\nNot a word more did he say; but, taking up the reins, drove on in silence\ntill they arrived at the gate of Brindehow, where he signed to him to\nalight.\n\nHe drove off in silence.\n\nWhen he arrived at his own house he sent the servant to bed, and then","went to his study, where he locked himself in.  Then, and then only, did\nhe permit his thoughts to have full range.  For the first time since the\nblow had fallen he looked straight in the face the change in his own\nlife.  He had loved Stephen so long and so honestly that it seemed to him\nnow as if that love had been the very foundation of his life.  He could\nnot remember a time when he had not loved her; away back to the time when\nhe, a big boy, took her, a little girl, under his care, and devoted\nhimself to her.  He had grown into the belief that so strong and so\r\nconsistent an affection, though he had never spoken it or even hinted at\nit or inferred it, had become a part of her life as well as of his own.\nAnd this was the end of that dreaming!  Not only did she not care for\nhim, but found herself with a heart so empty that she needs must propose\nmarriage to another man!  There was surely something, more than at\npresent he knew of or could understand, behind such an act done by her.\nWhy should she ask Everard to marry her?  Why should she ask any man?\nWomen didn't do such things! . . . Here he paused.  'Women didn't do such\r\nthings.'  All at once there came back to him fragments of discussions--in\nwhich Stephen had had a part, in which matters of convention had been\ndealt with.  Out of these dim and shattered memories came a comfort to\nhis heart, though his brain could not as yet grasp the reason of it.  He\nknew that Stephen had held an unconventional idea as to the equality of\nthe sexes.  Was it possible that she was indeed testing one of her\ntheories?\n\nThe idea stirred him so that he could not remain quiet.  He stood up, and\r\nwalked the room.  Somehow he felt light beginning to dawn, though he\ncould not tell its source, or guess at the final measure of its fulness.\nThe fact of Stephen having done such a thing was hard to bear; but it was\nharder to think that she should have done such a thing without a motive;\nor worse: with love of Leonard as a motive!  He shuddered as he paused.\nShe could not love such a man.  It was monstrous!  And yet she had done\nthis thing . . . 'Oh, if she had had any one to advise her, to restrain\nher!  But she had no mother!  No mother!  Poor Stephen!'","The pity of it, not for himself but for the woman he loved, overcame him.\nSitting down heavily before his desk, he put his face on his hands, and\nhis great shoulders shook.\n\nLong, long after the violence of his emotion had passed, he sat there\nmotionless, thinking with all the power and sincerity he knew; thinking\nfor Stephen's good.\n\nWhen a strong man thinks unselfishly some good may come out of it.  He\nmay blunder; but the conclusion of his reasoning must be in the main\nright.  So it was with Harold.  He knew that he was ignorant of women,\r\nand of woman's nature, as distinguished from man's.  The only woman he\nhad ever known well was Stephen; and she in her youth and in her\nignorance of the world and herself was hardly sufficient to supply to him\ndata for his present needs.  To a clean-minded man of his age a woman is\nsomething divine.  It is only when in later life disappointment and\nexperience have hammered bitter truth into his brain, that he begins to\nrealise that woman is not angelic but human.  When he knows more, and\nfinds that she is like himself, human and limited but with qualities of\r\npurity and sincerity and endurance which put his own to shame, he\nrealises how much better a helpmate she is for man than could be the\nvague, unreal creations of his dreams.  And then he can thank God for His\ngoodness that when He might have given us Angels He did give us women!\n\nOf one thing, despite the seeming of facts, he was sure: Stephen did not\nlove Leonard.  Every fibre of his being revolted at the thought.  She of\nso high a nature; he of so low.  She so noble; he so mean.  Bah! the\nbelief was impossible.\r\nImpossible!  Herein was the manifestation of his ignorance; anything is\npossible where love is concerned!  It was characteristic of the man that\nin his mind he had abandoned, for the present at all events, his own\npain.  He still loved Stephen with all the strength of his nature, but\nfor him the selfish side ceased to exist.  He was trying to serve\nStephen; and every other thought had to give way.  He had been satisfied\nthat in a manner she loved him in some way and in some degree; and he had\nhoped that in the fulness of time the childish love would ripen, so that","in the end would come a mutual affection which was of the very essence of\nHeaven.  He believed still that she loved him in some way; but the future\nthat was based on hope had now been wiped out with a sudden and unsparing\nhand.  She had actually proposed marriage to another man.  If the idea of\na marriage with him had ever crossed her mind she could have had no doubt\nof her feeling toward another. . . . And yet?  And yet he could not\nbelieve that she loved Leonard; not even if all trains of reasoning\nshould end by leading to that point.  One thing he had at present to\r\naccept, that whatever might be the measure of affection Stephen might\nhave for him, it was not love as he understood it.  He resolutely turned\nhis back on the thought of his own side of the matter, and tried to find\nsome justification of Stephen's act.\n\n'Seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened to ye' has perhaps\na general as well as a special significance.  It is by patient tireless\nseeking that many a precious thing has been found.  It was after many a\nlong cycle of thought that the seeking and the knocking had effectual\r\nresult.  Harold came to believe, vaguely at first but more definitely as\nthe evidence nucleated, that Stephen's act was due to some mad girlish\nwish to test her own theory; to prove to herself the correctness of her\nown reasoning, the fixity of her own purpose.  He did not go on analysing\nfurther; for as he walked the room with a portion of the weight taken\nfrom his heart he noticed that the sky was beginning to quicken.  The day\nwould soon be upon him, and there was work to be done.  Instinctively he\nknew that there was trouble in store for Stephen, and he felt that in\r\nsuch an hour he should be near her.  All her life she had been accustomed\nto him.  In her sorrows to confide in him, to tell him her troubles so\nthat they might dwindle and pass away; to enhance her pleasures by making\nhim a sharer in them.\n\nHarold was inspirited by the coming of the new day.  There was work to be\ndone, and the work must be based on thought.  His thoughts must take a\npractical turn; what was he to do that would help Stephen?  Here there\ndawned on him for the first time the understanding of a certain","humiliation which she had suffered; she had been refused!  She who had\nstepped so far out of the path of maidenly reserve in which she had\nalways walked as to propose marriage to a man, had been refused!  He did\nnot, could not, know to the full the measure of such humiliation to a\nwoman; but he could guess at any rate a part.  And that guessing made him\ngrind his teeth in impotent rage.\n\nBut out of that rage came an inspiration.  If Stephen had been humiliated\nby the refusal of one man, might not this be minimised if she in turn\r\nmight refuse another?  Harold knew so well the sincerity of his own love\nand the depth of his own devotion that he was satisfied that he could not\nerr in giving the girl the opportunity of refusing him.  It would be some\nsort of balm to her wounded spirit to know that Leonard's views were not\nshared by all men.  That there were others who would deem it a joy to\nserve as her slaves.  When she had refused him she would perhaps feel\neasier in her mind.  Of course if she did not refuse him . . . Ah! well,\nthen would the gates of Heaven open . . . But that would never be.  The\r\npast could not be blotted out!  All he could do would be to serve her.  He\nwould go early.  Such a man as Leonard Everard might make some new\ncomplication, and the present was quite bad enough.\n\nIt was a poor enough thing for him, he thought at length.  She might\ntrample on him; but it was for her sake.  And to him what did it matter?\nThe worst had come.  All was over now!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV--THE BEECH GROVE\n\n\nOn the morning following the proposal Stephen strolled out into a beech\ngrove, some little distance from the house, which from childhood had been\r\na favourite haunt of hers.  It was not in the immediate road to anywhere,\nand so there was no occasion for any of the household or the garden to go\nthrough it or near it.  She did not put on a hat, but took only a\nsunshade, which she used in passing over the lawn.  The grove was on the\nside of the house away from her own room and the breakfast-room.  When\nshe had reached its shade she felt that at last she was alone.\n\nThe grove was a privileged place.  Long ago a great number of young\nbeeches had been planted so thickly that as they grew they shot up","straight and branchless in their struggle for the light.  Not till they\nhad reached a considerable altitude had they been thinned; and then the\nthinning had been so effected that, as the high branches began to shoot\nout in the freer space, they met in time and interlaced so closely that\nthey made in many places a perfect screen of leafy shade.  Here and there\nwere rifts or openings through which the light passed; under such places\nthe grass was fine and green, or the wild hyacinths in due season tinged\nthe earth with blue.  Through the grove some wide alleys had been left:\r\ngreat broad walks where the soft grass grew short and fine, and to whose\nedges came a drooping of branches and an upspringing of undergrowth of\nlaurel and rhododendron.  At the far ends of these walks were little\npavilions of marble built in the classic style which ruled for garden use\ntwo hundred years ago.  At the near ends some of them were close to the\nbroad stretch of water from whose edges ran back the great sloping banks\nof emerald sward dotted here and there with great forest trees.  The\ngrove was protected by a ha-ha, so that it was never invaded from\r\nwithout, and the servants of the house, both the domestics and the\ngardeners and grooms, had been always forbidden to enter it.  Thus by\nlong usage it had become a place of quiet and solitude for the members of\nthe family.\n\nTo this soothing spot had come Stephen in her pain.  The long spell of\nself-restraint during that morning had almost driven her to frenzy, and\nshe sought solitude as an anodyne to her tortured soul.  The long anguish\nof a third sleepless night, following on a day of humiliation and terror,\r\nhad destroyed for a time the natural resilience of a healthy nature.  She\nhad been for so long in the prison of her own purpose with Fear as\nwarder; the fetters of conventional life had so galled her that here in\nthe accustomed solitude of this place, in which from childhood she had\nbeen used to move and think freely, she felt as does a captive who has\nescaped from an irksome durance.  As Stephen had all along been free of\nmovement and speech, no such opportunities of freedom called to her.  The\npent-up passion in her, however, found its own relief.  Her voice was","silent, and she moved with slow steps, halting often between the green\ntree-trunks in the cool shade; but her thoughts ran free, and passion\nfound a vent.  No stranger seeing the tall, queenly girl moving slowly\nthrough the trees could have imagined the fierce passion which blazed\nwithin her, unless he had been close enough to see her eyes.  The habit\nof physical restraint to which all her life she had been accustomed, and\nwhich was intensified by the experience of the past thirty-six hours,\nstill ruled her, even here.  Gradually the habit of security began to\r\nprevail, and the shackles to melt away.  Here had she come in all her\nchildish troubles.  Here had she fought with herself, and conquered\nherself.  Here the spirits of the place were with her and not against\nher.  Here memory in its second degree, habit, gave her the full sense of\nspiritual freedom.\n\nAs she walked to and fro the raging of her spirit changed its objective:\nfrom restraint to its final causes; and chief amongst them the pride\nwhich had been so grievously hurt.  How she loathed the day that had\r\npassed, and how more than all she hated herself for her part in it; her\nmad, foolish, idiotic, self-importance which gave her the idea of such an\nact and urged her to the bitter end of its carrying out; her mulish\nobstinacy in persisting when every fibre of her being had revolted at the\ndoing, and when deep in her inmost soul was a deterring sense of its\nfutility.  How could she have stooped to have done such a thing: to ask a\nman . . . oh! the shame of it, the shame of it all!  How could she have\nbeen so blind as to think that such a man was worthy! . . .\r\nIn the midst of her whirlwind of passion came a solitary gleam of relief:\nshe knew with certainty that she did not love Leonard; that she had never\nloved him.  The coldness of disdain to him, the fear of his future acts\nwhich was based on disbelief of the existence of that finer nature with\nwhich she had credited him, all proved to her convincingly that he could\nnever really have been within the charmed circle of her inner life.  Did\nshe but know it, there was an even stronger evidence of her indifference\nto him in the ready manner in which her thoughts flew past him in their","circling sweep.  For a moment she saw him as the centre of a host of\nbesetting fears; but her own sense of superior power nullified the force\nof the vision.  She was able to cope with him and his doings, were there\nsuch need.  And so her mind flew back to the personal side of her\ntrouble: her blindness, her folly, her shame.\n\nIn truth she was doing good work for herself.  Her mind was working truly\nand to a beneficent end.  One by one she was overcoming the false issues\nof her passion and drifting to an end in which she would see herself face\r\nto face and would place so truly the blame for what had been as to make\nit a warning and ennobling lesson of her life.  She moved more quickly,\npassing to and fro as does a panther in its cage when the desire of\nforest freedom is heavy upon it.\n\nThat which makes the irony of life will perhaps never be understood in\nits casual aspect by the finite mind of man.  The 'why' and 'wherefore'\nand the 'how' of it is only to be understood by that All-wise\nintelligence which can scan the future as well as the present, and see\r\nthe far far-reaching ramifications of those schemes of final development\nto which the manifestation of completed character tend.\n\nTo any mortal it would seem a pity that to Stephen in her solitude, when\nher passion was working itself out to an end which might be good, should\ncome an interruption which would throw it back upon itself in such a way\nas to multiply its malignant force.  But again it is a part of the Great\nPlan that instruments whose use man's finite mind could never predicate\nshould be employed: the seeming good to evil, the seeming evil to good.\r\nAs she swept to and fro, her raging spirit compelling to violent\nmovement, Stephen's eyes were arrested by the figure of a man coming\nthrough the aisles of the grove.  At such a time any interruption of her\npassion was a cause for heightening anger; but the presence of a person\nwas as a draught to a full-fed furnace.  Most of all, in her present\ncondition of mind, the presence of a man--for the thought of a man lay\nbehind all her trouble, was as a tornado striking a burning forest.  The\nblood of her tortured heart seemed to leap to her brain and to suffuse","her eyes.  She 'saw blood'!\n\nIt mattered not that the man whom she saw she knew and trusted.  Indeed,\nthis but added fuel to the flame.  In the presence of a stranger some of\nher habitual self-restraint would doubtless have come back to her.  But\nnow the necessity for such was foregone; Harold was her alter ego, and in\nhis presence was safety.  He was, in this aspect, but a higher and more\nintelligent rendering of the trees around her.  In another aspect he was\nan opportune victim, something to strike at.  When the anger of a poison\r\nsnake opens its gland, and the fang is charged with venom, it must strike\nat something.  It does not pause or consider what it may be; it strikes,\nthough it may be at stone or iron.  So Stephen waited till her victim was\nwithin distance to strike.  Her black eyes, fierce with passion and blood-\nrimmed as a cobra's, glittered as he passed among the tree-trunks towards\nher, eager with his errand of devotion.\n\nHarold was a man of strong purpose.  Had he not been, he would never have\ncome on his present errand.  Never, perhaps, had any suitor set forth on\r\nhis quest with a heavier heart.  All his life, since his very boyhood,\nhad been centred round the girl whom to-day he had come to serve.  All\nhis thought had been for her: and to-day all he could expect was a gentle\ndenial of all his hopes, so that his future life would be at best a\nblank.\n\nBut he would be serving Stephen!  His pain might be to her good; ought to\nbe, to a certain extent, to her mental ease.  Her wounded pride would\nfind some solace . . . As he came closer the feeling that he had to play\na part, veritably to act one, came stronger and stronger upon him, and\r\nfilled him with bitter doubt as to his power.  Still he went on boldly.\nIt had been a part of his plan to seem to come eagerly, as a lover should\ncome; and so he came.  When he got close to Stephen, all the witchery of\nher presence came upon him as of old.  After all, he loved her with his\nwhole soul; and the chance had come to tell her so.  Even under the\ndistressing conditions of his suit, the effort had its charm.\n\nStephen schooled herself to her usual attitude with him; and that, too,\nsince the effort was based on truth came with a certain ease to her.  At","the present time, in her present frame of mind, nothing in the wide world\ncould give her pleasure; the ease which came, if it did not change her\npurpose, increased her power.  Their usual salutation, begun when she was\na little baby, was 'Good morning, Stephen!'  'Good morning, Harold!'  It\nhad become so much a custom that now it came mechanically on her part.\nThe tender reference to childhood's days, though it touched her companion\nto the quick, did not appeal to her since she had no special thought of\nit.  Had such a thought come to her it might have softened her even to\r\ntears, for Harold had been always deep in her heart.  As might have been\nexpected from her character and condition of mind, she was the first to\nbegin:\n\n'I suppose you want to see me about something special, Harold, you have\ncome so early.'\n\n'Yes, Stephen.  Very special!'\n\n'Were you at the house?' she asked in a voice whose quietness might have\nconveyed a warning.  She was so suspicious now that she suspected even\nHarold of--of what she did not know.  He answered in all simplicity:\n\n'No.  I came straight here.'\r\n'How did you know I should be here?'  Her voice was now not only quiet\nbut sweet.  Without thinking, Harold blundered on.  His intention was so\nsingle-minded, and his ignorance of woman so complete, that he did not\nrecognise even elementary truths:\n\n'I knew you always came here long ago when you were a child when you were\nin--'  Here it suddenly flashed upon him that if he seemed to expect that\nshe was in trouble as he had purposed saying, he would give away his\nknowledge of what had happened and so destroy the work to which he had\r\nset himself.  So he finished the sentence in a lame and impotent manner,\nwhich, however, saved complete annihilation as it was verbally accurate:\n'in short frocks.'  Stephen needed to know little more.  Her quick\nintelligence grasped the fact that there was some purpose afoot which she\ndid not know or understand.  She surmised, of course, that it was some\nway in connection with her mad act, and she grew cooler in her brain as\nwell as colder in her heart as she prepared to learn more.  Stephen had\nchanged from girl to woman in the last twenty-four hours; and all the","woman in her was now awake.  After a moment's pause she said with a\nwinning smile:\n\n'Why, Harold, I've been in long frocks for years.  Why should I come here\non this special day on that account?'  Even as she was speaking she felt\nthat it would be well to abandon this ground of inquiry.  It had clearly\ntold her all it could.  She would learn more by some other means.  So she\nwent on in a playful way, as a cat--not a kitten--does when it has got a\nmouse:\n\n'That reason won't work, Harold.  It's quite rusty in the joints.  But\r\nnever mind it!  Tell me why you have come so early?'  This seemed to\nHarold to be a heaven-sent opening; he rushed in at once:\n\n'Because, Stephen, I wanted to ask you to be my wife!  Oh! Stephen, don't\nyou know that I love you?  Ever since you were a little girl!  When you\nwere a little girl and I a big boy I loved you.  I have loved you ever\nsince with all my heart, and soul, and strength.  Without you the world\nis a blank to me!  For you and your happiness I would do\nanything--anything!'\n\nThis was no acting.  When once the barrier of beginning had been broken,\r\nhis soul seemed to pour itself out.  The man was vibrant through all his\nnature; and the woman's very soul realised its truth.  For an instant a\nflame of gladness swept through her; and for the time it lasted put all\nother thought aside.\n\nBut suspicion is a hard metal which does not easily yield to fire.  It\ncan come to white heat easily enough, but its melting-point is high\nindeed.  When the flame had leaped it had spent its force; the reaction\ncame quick.  Stephen's heart seemed to turn to ice, all the heat and life\r\nrushing to her brain.  Her thoughts flashed with convincing quickness;\nthere was no time for doubting amid their rush.  Her life was for good or\nill at the crossing of the ways.  She had trusted Harold thoroughly.  The\nhabit of her whole life from her babyhood up had been to so look to him\nas comrade and protector and sympathetic friend.  She was so absolutely\nsure of his earnest devotion that this new experience of a riper feeling\nwould have been a joy to her, if it should be that his act was all\nspontaneous and done in ignorance of her shame.  'Shame' was the generic","word which now summarised to herself her thought of her conduct in\nproposing to Leonard.  But of this she must be certain.  She could not,\ndare not, go farther till this was settled.  With the same craving for\ncertainty with which she convinced herself that Leonard understood her\novertures, and with the same dogged courage with which she pressed the\nmatter on him, she now went on to satisfy her mind.\n\n'What did you do yesterday?'\n\n'I was at Norcester all day.  I went early.  By the way, here is the\r\nribbon you wanted; I think it's exactly the same as the pattern.'  As he\nspoke he took a tissue-piper parcel from his pocket and handed it to her.\n\n'Thanks!' she said.  'Did you meet any friends there?'\n\n'Not many.'  He answered guardedly; he had a secret to keep.\n\n'Where did you dine?'\n\n'At the club!'  He began to be uneasy at this questioning; but he did not\nsee any way to avoid answering without creating some suspicion.\n\n'Did you see any one you knew at the club?'  Her voice as she spoke was a\nlittle harder, a little more strained.  Harold noticed the change, rather\r\nby instinct than reason.  He felt that there was danger in it, and\npaused.  The pause seemed to suddenly create a new fury in the breast of\nStephen.  She felt that Harold was playing with her.  Harold!  If she\ncould not trust him, where then was she to look for trust in the world?\nIf he was not frank with her, what then meant his early coming; his\nseeking her in the grove; his proposal of marriage, which seemed so\nsudden and so inopportune?  He must have seen Leonard, and by some means\nhave become acquainted with her secret of shame . . . His motive?\r\nHere her mind halted.  She knew as well as if it had been trumpeted from\nthe skies that Harold knew all.  But she must be certain . . . Certain!\n\nShe was standing erect, her hands held down by her sides and clenched\ntogether till the knuckles were white; all her body strung high--like an\nover-pitched violin.  Now she raised her right hand and flung it downward\nwith a passionate jerk.\n\n'Answer me!' she cried imperiously.  'Answer me!  Why are you playing\nwith me?  Did you see Leonard Everard last night?  Answer me, I say.\nHarold An Wolf, you do not lie!  Answer me!'","As she spoke Harold grew cold.  From the question he now knew that\nStephen had guessed his secret.  The fat was in the fire with a\nvengeance.  He did not know what to do, and still remained silent.  She\ndid not give him time to think, but spoke again, this time more coldly.\nThe white terror had replaced the red:\n\n'Are you not going to answer me a simple question, Harold?  To be silent\nnow is to wrong me!  I have a right to know!'\n\nIn his trouble, for he felt that say what he would he could only give her\nnew pain, he said humbly:\r\n'Don't ask me, Stephen!  Won't you understand that I want to do what is\nbest for you?  Won't you trust me?'  Her answer came harshly.  A more\nexperienced man than Harold, one who knew women better, would have seen\nhow overwrought she was, and would have made pity the pivot of his future\nbearing and acts and words while the interview lasted; pity, and pity\nonly.  But to Harold the high ideal was ever the same.  The Stephen whom\nhe loved was no subject for pity, but for devotion only.  He knew the\nnobility of her nature and must trust it to the end.  When her silence\r\nand her blazing eyes denied his request, he answered her query in a low\nvoice:\n\n'I did!'  Even whilst he spoke he was thankful for one thing, he had not\nbeen pledged in any way to confidence.  Leonard had forced the knowledge\non him; and though he would have preferred a million times over to be\nsilent, he was still free to speak.  Stephen's next question came more\ncoldly still:\n\n'Did he tell you of his meeting with me?'\n\n'He did.'\n\n'Did he tell you all?'  It was torture to him to answer; but he was at\nthe stake and must bear it.\n\n'I think so!  If it was true.'\r\n'What did he tell you?  Stay!  I shall ask you the facts myself; the\nbroad facts.  We need not go into details . . . '\n\n'Oh, Stephen!'  She silenced his pleading with an imperious hand.\n\n'If I can go into this matter, surely you can.  If I can bear the shame\nof telling, you can at least bear that of listening.  Remember that\nknowing--knowing what you know, or at least what you have heard--you\ncould come here and propose marriage to me!'  This she said with a cold,\ncutting sarcasm which sounded like the rasping of a roughly-sharpened","knife through raw flesh.  Harold groaned in spirit; he felt a weakness\nwhich began at his heart to steal through him.  It took all his manhood\nto bear himself erect.  He dreaded what was coming, as of old the once-\ntortured victim dreaded the coming torment of the rack.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV--THE END OF THE MEETING\n\n\nStephen went on in her calm, cold voice:\n\n'Did he tell you that I had asked him to marry me?'  Despite herself, as\nshe spoke the words a red tide dyed her face.  It was not a flush; it was\nnot a blush; it was a sort of flood which swept through her, leaving her\r\nin a few seconds whiter than before.  Harold saw and understood.  He\ncould not speak; he lowered his head silently.  Her eyes glittered more\ncoldly.  The madness that every human being may have once was upon her.\nSuch a madness is destructive, and here was something more vulnerable\nthan herself.\n\n'Did he tell you how I pressed him?'  There was no red tide this time,\nnor ever again whilst the interview lasted.  To bow in affirmation was\ninsufficient; with an effort he answered:\n\n'I understood so.'  She answered with an icy sarcasm:\r\n'You understood so!  Oh, I don't doubt he embellished the record with\nsome of his own pleasantries.  But you understood it; and that is\nsufficient.'  After a pause she went on:\n\n'Did he tell you that he had refused me?'\n\n'Yes!'  Harold knew now that he was under the torture, and that there was\nno refusing.  She went on, with a light laugh, which wrung his heart even\nmore than her pain had done . . . Stephen to laugh like that!\n\n'And I have no doubt that he embellished that too, with some of his fine\nmasculine witticisms.  I understood myself that he was offended at my\r\nasking him.  I understood it quite well; he told me so!'  Then with\nfeminine intuition she went on:\n\n'I dare say that before he was done he said something kindly of the poor\nlittle thing that loved him; that loved him so much, and that she had to\nbreak down all the bounds of modesty and decorum that had made the women\nof her house honoured for a thousand years!  And you listened to him\nwhilst he spoke!  Oh-h-h!' she quivered with her white-hot anger, as the\nfierce heat in the heart of a furnace quivers.  But her voice was cold","again as she went on:\n\n'But who could help loving him?  Girls always did.  It was such a beastly\nnuisance!  You \"understood\" all that, I dare say; though perhaps he did\nnot put it in such plain words!'  Then the scorn, which up to now had\nbeen imprisoned, turned on him; and he felt as though some hose of\ndeathly chill was being played upon him.\n\n'And yet you, knowing that only yesterday, he had refused me--refused my\npressing request that he should marry me, come to me hot-foot in the\nearly morning and ask me to be your wife.  I thought such things did not\r\ntake place; that men were more honourable, or more considerate, or more\nmerciful!  Or at least I used to think so; till yesterday.  No! till to-\nday.  Yesterday's doings were my own doings, and I had to bear the\npenalty of them myself.  I had come here to fight out by myself the\nbattle of my shame . . . '\n\nHere Harold interrupted her.  He could not bear to hear Stephen use such\na word in connection with herself.\n\n'No!  You must not say \"shame.\"  There is no shame to you, Stephen.  There\ncan be none, and no one must say it in my presence!'  In her secret heart\r\nof hearts she admired him for his words; she felt them at the moment sink\ninto her memory, and knew that she would never forget the mastery of his\nface and bearing.  But the blindness of rage was upon her, and it is of\nthe essence of this white-hot anger that it preys not on what is basest\nin us, but on what is best.  That Harold felt deeply was her opportunity\nto wound him more deeply than before.\n\n'Even here in the solitude which I had chosen as the battleground of my\nshame you had need to come unasked, unthought of, when even a lesser mind\r\nthan yours, for you are no fool, would have thought to leave me alone.  My\nshame was my own, I tell you; and I was learning to take my punishment.\nMy punishment!  Poor creatures that we are, we think our punishment will\nbe what we would like best: to suffer in silence, and not to have spread\nabroad our shame!'  How she harped on that word, though she knew that\nevery time she uttered it, it cut to the heart of the man who loved her.\n'And yet you come right on top of my torture to torture me still more and","illimitably.  You come, you who alone had the power to intrude yourself\non my grief and sorrow; power given you by my father's kindness.  You\ncome to me without warning, considerately telling me that you knew I\nwould be here because I had always come here when I had been in trouble.\nNo--I do you an injustice.  \"In trouble\" was not what you said, but that\nI had come when I had been in short frocks.  Short frocks!  And you came\nto tell me that you loved me.  You thought, I suppose, that as I had\nrefused one man, I would jump at the next that came along.  I wanted a\r\nman.  God! God! what have I done that such an affront should come upon\nme?  And come, too, from a hand that should have protected me if only in\ngratitude for my father's kindness!'  She was eyeing him keenly, with\neyes that in her unflinching anger took in everything with the accuracy\nof sun-painting.  She wanted to wound; and she succeeded.\n\nBut Harold had nerves and muscles of steel; and when the call came to\nthem they answered.  Though the pain of death was upon him he did not\nflinch.  He stood before her like a rock, in all his great manhood; but a\r\nrock on whose summit the waves had cast the wealth of their foam, for his\nface was as white as snow.  She saw and understood; but in the madness\nupon her she went on trying new places and new ways to wound:\n\n'You thought, I suppose, that this poor, neglected, despised, rejected\nwoman, who wanted so much to marry that she couldn't wait for a man to\nask her, would hand herself over to the first chance comer who threw his\nhandkerchief to her; would hand over herself--and her fortune!'\n\n'Oh, Stephen!  How can you say such things, think such things?'  The\r\nprotest broke from him with a groan.  His pain seemed to inflame her\nstill further; to gratify her hate, and to stimulate her mad passion:\n\n'Why did I ever see you at all?  Why did my father treat you as a son;\nthat when you had grown and got strong on his kindness you could thus\ninsult his daughter in the darkest hour of her pain and her shame!'  She\nalmost choked with passion.  There was now nothing in the whole world\nthat she could trust.  In the pause he spoke:\n\n'Stephen, I never meant you harm.  Oh, don't speak such wild words.  They","will come back to you with sorrow afterwards!  I only meant to do you\ngood.  I wanted . . . '  Her anger broke out afresh:\n\n'There; you speak it yourself!  You only wanted to do me good.  I was so\nbad that any kind of a husband . . . Oh, get out of my sight!  I wish to\nGod I had never seen you!  I hope to God I may never see you again!  Go!\nGo!  Go!'\n\nThis was the end!  To Harold's honest mind such words would have been\nimpossible had not thoughts of truth lain behind them.  That Stephen--his\nStephen, whose image in his mind shut out every other woman in the world,\r\npast, present, and future--should say such things to any one, that she\nshould think such things, was to him a deadly blow.  But that she should\nsay them to him! . . . Utterance, even the utterance which speaks in the\ninmost soul, failed him.  He had in some way that he knew not\nhurt--wounded--killed Stephen; for the finer part was gone from the\nStephen that he had known and worshipped so long.  She wished him gone;\nshe wished she had never seen him; she hoped to God never to see him\nagain.  Life for him was over and done!  There could be no more happiness\r\nin the world; no more wish to work, to live! . . .\n\nHe bowed gravely; and without a word turned and walked away.\n\nStephen saw him go, his tall form moving amongst the tree trunks till\nfinally it was lost in their massing.  She was so filled with the tumult\nof her passion that she looked, unmoved.  Even the sense of his going did\nnot change her mood.  She raged to and fro amongst the trees, her\nmovements getting quicker and quicker as her excitement began to change\nfrom mental to physical; till the fury began to exhaust itself.  All at\r\nonce she stopped, as though arrested by a physical barrier; and with a\nmoan sank down in a helpless heap on the cool moss.\n\n* * * * *\n\nHarold went from the grove as one seems to move in a dream.  Little\nthings and big were mixed up in his mind.  He took note, as he went\ntowards the town by the byroads, of everything around him in his usual\nway, for he had always been one of those who notice unconsciously, or\nrather unintentionally.  Long afterwards he could shut his eyes and\nrecall every step of the way from the spot where he had turned from","Stephen to the railway station outside Norcester.  And on many and many\nsuch a time when he opened them again the eyelids were wet.  He wanted to\nget away quickly, silently, unobserved.  With the instinct of habitual\nthought his mind turned London-ward.  He met but few persons, and those\nonly cottiers.  He saluted them in his usual cheery way, but did not stop\nto speak with any.  He was about to take a single ticket to London when\nit struck him that this might look odd, so he asked for a return.  Then,\r\nhis mind being once more directed towards concealment of purpose, he sent\na telegram to his housekeeper telling her that he was called away to\nLondon on business.  It was only when he was far on his journey that he\ngave thought to ways and means, and took stock of his possessions.  Before\nhe took out his purse and pocket-book he made up his mind that he would\nbe content with what it was, no matter how little.  He had left\nNormanstand and all belonging to it for ever, and was off to hide himself\nin whatever part of the world would afford him the best opportunity.  Life\r\nwas over!  There was nothing to look forward to; nothing to look back at!\nThe present was a living pain whose lightest element was despair.  As,\nhowever, he got further and further away, his practical mind began to\nwork; he thought over matters so as to arrange in his mind how best he\ncould dispose of his affairs, so to cause as little comment as might be,\nand to save the possibility of worry or distress of any kind to Stephen.\n\nEven then, in his agony of mind, his heart was with her; it was not the\nleast among his troubles that he would have to be away from her when\r\nperhaps she would need him most.  And yet whenever he would come to this\npoint in his endless chain of thought, he would have to stop for a while,\novercome with such pain that his power of thinking was paralysed.  He\nwould never, could never, be of service to her again.  He had gone out of\nher life, as she had gone out of his life; though she never had, nor\nnever could out of his thoughts.  It was all over!  All the years of\nsweetness, of hope, and trust, and satisfied and justified faith in each\nother, had been wiped out by that last terrible, cruel meeting.  Oh! how","could she have said such things to him!  How could she have thought them!\nAnd there she was now in all the agony of her unrestrained passion.  Well\nhe knew, from his long experience of her nature, how she must have\nsuffered to be in such a state of mind, to have so forgotten all the\nrestraint of her teaching and her life!  Poor, poor Stephen!  Fatherless\nnow as well as motherless; and friendless as well as fatherless!  No one\nto calm her in the height of her wild abnormal passion!  No one to\ncomfort her when the fit had passed!  No one to sympathise with her for\r\nall that she had suffered!  No one to help her to build new and better\nhopes out of the wreck of her mad ideas!  He would cheerfully have given\nhis life for her.  Only last night he was prepared to kill, which was\nworse than to die, for her sake.  And now to be far away, unable to help,\nunable even to know how she fared.  And behind her eternally the shadow\nof that worthless man who had spurned her love and flouted her to a\nchance comer in his drunken delirium.  It was too bitter to bear.  How\r\ncould God lightly lay such a burden on his shoulders who had all his life\ntried to walk in sobriety and chastity and in all worthy and manly ways!\nIt was unfair!  It was unfair!  If he could do anything for her?\nAnything!  Anything! . . . And so the unending whirl of thoughts went on!\n\nThe smoke of London was dim on the horizon when he began to get back to\npractical matters.  When the train drew up at Euston he stepped from it\nas one to whom death would be a joyous relief!\n\nHe went to a quiet hotel, and from there transacted by letter such\r\nbusiness matters as were necessary to save pain and trouble to others.  As\nfor himself, he made up his mind that he would go to Alaska, which he\ntook to be one of the best places in the as yet uncivilised world for a\nman to lose his identity.  As a security at the start he changed his\nname; and as John Robinson, which was not a name to attract public\nattention, he shipped as a passenger on the _Scoriac_ from London to New\nYork.\n\nThe _Scoriac_ was one of the great cargo boats which take a certain\nnumber of passengers.  The few necessaries which he took with him were","chosen with an eye to utility in that frozen land which he sought.  For\nthe rest, he knew nothing, nor did he care how or whither he went.  His\nvague purpose was to cross the American Continent to San Francisco, and\nthere to take passage for the high latitudes north of the Yukon River.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen Stephen began to regain consciousness her first sensation was one of\nnumbness.  She was cold in the back, and her feet did not seem to exist;\nbut her head was hot and pulsating as though her brain were a living\nthing.  Then her half-open eyes began to take in her surroundings.  For\r\nanother long spell she began to wonder why all around her was green.  Then\ncame the inevitable process of reason.  Trees!  It is a wood!  How did I\ncome here? why am I lying on the ground?\n\nAll at once wakened memory opened on her its flood-gates, and overwhelmed\nher with pain.  With her hands pressed to her throbbing temples and her\nburning face close to the ground, she began to recall what she could of\nthe immediate past.  It all seemed like a terrible dream.  By degrees her\nintelligence came back to its normal strength, and all at once, as does\r\none suddenly wakened from sleep to the knowledge of danger, she sat up.\n\nSomehow the sense of time elapsed made Stephen look at her watch.  It was\nhalf-past twelve.  As she had come into the grove immediately after\nbreakfast, and as Harold had almost immediately joined her, and as the\ninterview between them had been but short, she must have lain on the\nground for more than three hours.  She rose at once, trembling in every\nlimb.  A new fear began to assail her; that she had been missed at home,\nand that some one might have come to look for her.  Up to now she had not\r\nbeen able to feel the full measure of pain regarding what had passed, but\nwhich would, she knew, come to her in the end.  It was too vague as yet;\nshe could not realise that it had really been.  But the fear of discovery\nwas immediate, and must be guarded against without delay.  As well as she\ncould, she tidied herself and began to walk slowly back to the house,\nhoping to gain her own room unnoticed.  That her general intelligence was\nawake was shown by the fact that before she left the grove she remembered","that she had forgotten her sunshade.  She went back and searched till she\nhad found it.\n\nGaining her room without meeting any one, she at once change her dress,\nfearing that some soil or wrinkle might betray her.  Resolutely she put\nback from her mind all consideration of the past; there would be time for\nthat later on.  Her nerves were already much quieter than they had been.\nThat long faint, or lapse into insensibility, had for the time taken the\nplace of sleep.  There would be a price to be paid for it later; but for\r\nthe present it had served its purpose.  Now and again she was disturbed\nby one thought; she could not quite remember what had occurred after\nHarold had left, and just before she became unconscious.  She dared not\ndwell upon it, however.  It would doubtless all come back to her when she\nhad leisure to think the whole matter over as a connected narrative.\n\nWhen the gong sounded for lunch she went down, with a calm exterior, to\nface the dreaded ordeal of another meal.\n\nLuncheon passed off without a hitch.  She and her aunt talked as usual\r\nover all the small affairs of the house and the neighbourhood, and the\ncalm restraint was in itself soothing.  Even then she could not help\nfeeling how much convention is to a woman's life.  Had it not been for\nthese recurring trials of set hours and duties she could never have\npassed the last day and night without discovery of her condition of mind.\nThat one terrible, hysterical outburst was perhaps the safety valve.  Had\nit been spread over the time occupied in conventional duties its force\neven then might have betrayed her; but without the necessity of nerving\r\nherself to conventional needs, she would have infallibly betrayed herself\nby her negative condition.\n\nAfter lunch she went to her own boudoir where, when she had shut the\ninner door, no one was allowed to disturb her without some special need\nin the house or on the arrival of visitors.  This 'sporting oak' was the\nsign of 'not at home' which she had learned in her glimpse of college\nlife.  Here in the solitude of safety, she began to go over the past,\nresolutely and systematically.\n\nShe had already been so often over the memory of the previous humiliating","and unhappy day that she need not revert to it at present.  Since then\nhad she not quarrelled with Harold, whom she had all her life so trusted\nthat her quarrel with him seemed to shake the very foundations of her\nexistence?  As yet she had not remembered perfectly all that had gone on\nunder the shadow of the beech grove.  She dared not face it all at once,\neven as yet.  Time must elapse before she should dare to cry; to think of\nher loss of Harold was to risk breaking down altogether.  Already she\nfelt weak.  The strain of the last forty-eight hours was too much for her\r\nphysical strength.  She began to feel, as she lay back in her cushioned\nchair, that a swoon is no worthy substitute for sleep.  Indeed it had\nseemed to make the need for sleep even more imperative.\n\nIt was all too humiliating!  She wanted to think over what had been; to\nrecall it as far as possible so as to fix it in her mind, whilst it was\nstill fresh.  Later on, some action might have to be based on her\nrecollection.  And yet . . . How could she think when she was so tired\n. . . tired . . .\n\nNature came to the poor girl's relief at last, and she fell into a heavy\r\nsleep . . .\n\nIt was like coming out of the grave to be dragged back to waking life out\nof such a sleep, and so soon after it had begun.  But the voice seemed to\nreach to her inner consciousness in some compelling way.  For a second\nshe could not understand; but as she rose from the cushions the maid's\nmessage repeated, brought her wide awake and alert in an instant:\n\n'Mr. Everard, young Mr. Everard, to see you, miss!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI--A PRIVATE CONVERSATION\n\n\nThe name braced Stephen at once.  Here was danger, an enemy to be\r\nencountered; all the fighting blood of generations leaped to the\noccasion.  The short spell of sleep had helped to restore her.  There\nremained still quite enough of mental and nervous excitement to make her\nthink quickly; the words were hardly out of the maid's mouth before her\nresolution was taken.  It would never do to let Leonard Everard see she\nwas diffident about meeting him; she would go down at once.  But she\nwould take the precaution of having her aunt present; at any rate, till\nshe should have seen how the land lay.  Her being just waked from sleep","would be an excuse for asking her aunt to see the visitor till she came\ndown.  So she said to the maid:\n\n'I have been asleep.  I must have got tired walking in the wood in the\nheat.  Ask Auntie to kindly see Mr. Everard in the blue drawing-room till\nI come down.  I must tidy my hair; but I will be down in a few minutes.'\n\n'Shall I send Marjorie to you, miss?'\n\n'No!  Don't mind; I can do what I want myself.  Hurry down to Miss\nRowly!'\n\nHow she regarded Leonard Everard now was shown in her instinctive\nclassing him amongst her enemies.\r\nWhen she entered the room she seemed all aglow.  She wanted not only to\novercome but to punish; and all the woman in her had risen to the effort.\nNever in her life had Stephen Norman looked more radiantly beautiful,\nmore adorable, more desirable.  Even Leonard Everard felt his pulses\nquicken as he saw that glowing mass of beauty standing out against the\ncold background of old French tapestry.  All the physical side of him\nleaped in answer to the call of her beauty; and even his cold heart and\nhis self-engrossed brain followed with slower gait.  He had been sitting\r\nopposite Miss Rowly in one of the windows, twirling his hat in nervous\nsuspense.  He jumped up, and, as she came towards him, went forward\nrapidly to greet her.  No one could mistake the admiration in his eyes.\nEver since he had made up his mind to marry her she had assumed a new\naspect in his thoughts.  But now her presence swept away all false\nimaginings; from the moment that her loveliness dawned upon him something\nlike love began to grow within his breast.  Stephen saw the look and it\nstrengthened her.  He had so grievously wounded her pride the previous\r\nday that her victory on this was a compensation which set her more at her\nold poise.\n\nHer greeting was all sweetness: she was charmed to see him.  How was his\nfather, and what was the news?  Miss Rowly looked on with smiling visage.\nShe too had seen the look of admiration in his eyes, and it pleased her.\nOld ladies, especially when they are maiden ladies, always like to see\nadmiration in the eyes of young men when they are turned in the direction\nof any girl dear to them.\n\nThey talked for some time, keeping all the while, by Stephen's clever","generalship, to the small-talk of the neighbourhood and the minor events\nof social importance.  As the time wore on she could see that Leonard was\ngrowing impatient, and evidently wanted to see her alone.  She ignored,\nhowever, all his little private signalling, and presently ordered tea to\nbe brought.  This took some little time; when it had been brought and\nserved and drunk, Leonard was in a smothered fume of impatience.  She was\nglad to see that as yet her aunt had noticed nothing, and she still hoped\nthat she would be able to so prolong matters, that she would escape\r\nwithout a private interview.  She did not know the cause of Leonard's\nimpatience: that he must see her before the day passed.  She too was an\negoist, in her own way; in the flush of belief of his subjugation she did\nnot think of attributing to him any other motive than his desire for\nherself.  As she had made up her mind on the final issue she did not want\nto be troubled by a new 'scene.'\n\nBut, after all, Leonard was a man; and man's ways are more direct than\nwoman's.  Seeing that he could not achieve his object in any other way,\r\nhe said out suddenly, thinking, and rightly, that she would not wish to\nforce an issue in the presence of her aunt:\n\n'By the way, Miss Norman,' he had always called her 'Miss Norman' in her\naunt's presence: 'I want to have two minutes with you before I go.  On a\nmatter of business,' he added, noticing Miss Rowly's surprised look.  The\nold lady was old-fashioned even for her age; in her time no young man\nwould have asked to see a young lady alone on business.  Except on one\nkind of business; and with regard to that kind of business gentlemen had\r\nto obtain first the confidence and permission of guardians.  Leonard saw\nthe difficulty and said quickly:\n\n'It is on the matter you wrote to me about!'\n\nStephen was prepared for a nasty shock, but hardly for so nasty a one as\nthis.  There was an indelicacy about it which went far beyond the bounds\nof thoughtless conventionality.  That such an appeal should be made to\nher, and in such a way, savoured of danger.  Her woman's intuition gave\nher the guard, and at once she spoke, smilingly and gently as one","recalling a matter in which the concern is not her own:\n\n'Of course!  It was selfish of me not to have thought of it, and to have\nkept you so long waiting.  The fact is, Auntie, that Leonard--I like to\ncall him Leonard, since we were children together, and he is so young;\nthough perhaps it would be more decorous nowadays to say \"Mr.\nEverard\"--has consulted me about his debts.  You know, Auntie dear, that\nyoung men will be young men in such matters; or perhaps you do not, since\nthe only person who ever worried you has been myself.  But I stayed at\r\nOxford and I know something of young men's ways; and as I am necessarily\nmore or less of a man of business, he values my help.  Don't you,\nLeonard?'  The challenge was so direct, and the position he was in so\ndaringly put, that he had to acquiesce.  Miss Rowly, who had looked on\nwith a frown of displeasure, said coldly:\n\n'I know you are your own mistress, my dear.  But surely it would be\nbetter if Mr. Everard would consult with his solicitor or his father's\nagent, or some of his gentlemen friends, rather than with a young lady\r\nwhose relations with him, after all, are only those of a neighbour on\nvisiting terms.  For my own part, I should have thought that Mr.\nEverard's best course would have been to consult his own father!  But the\nthings that gentlemen, as well as ladies do, have been sadly changed\nsince my time!'  Then, rising in formal dignity, she bowed gravely to the\nvisitor before leaving the room.\n\nBut the position of being left alone in the room with Leonard did not at\nall suit Stephen's plans.  Rising quickly she said to her aunt:\n\n'Don't stir, Auntie.  I dare say you are right in what you say; but I\r\npromised Mr. Everard to go into the matter.  And as I have brought the\nawkwardness on myself, I suppose I must bear it.  If Mr. Everard wants to\nsee me alone, and I suppose he is diffident in speaking on such a matter\nbefore you--he didn't play with you, you know!--we can go out on the\nlawn.  We shan't be long!'  Before Leonard could recover his wits she had\nheaded him out on the lawn.\n\nHer strategy was again thoroughly good.  The spot she chose, though\nbeyond earshot, was quite in the open and commanded by all the windows in","that side of the house.  A person speaking there might say what he liked,\nbut his actions must be discreet.\n\nOn the lawn Stephen tripped ahead; Leonard followed inwardly raging.  By\nher clever use of the opening she had put him in a difficulty from which\nthere was no immediate means of extrication.  He could not quarrel\novertly with Stephen; if he did so, how could he enter on the pressing\nmatter of his debts?  He dared not openly proclaim his object in wishing\nto marry her, for had he done so her aunt might have interfered, with\nwhat success he could not be sure.  In any case it would cause delay, and\r\ndelay was what he could not afford.  He felt that in mentioning his debts\nat just such a movement he had given Stephen the chance she had so aptly\ntaken.  He had to be on his good behaviour, however; and with an\napprehension that was new to him he followed her.\n\nAn old Roman marble seat was placed at an angle from the house so that\nthe one of the two occupants within its curve must almost face the house,\nwhilst the other gave to it at least a quarter-face.  Stephen seated\nherself on the near side, leaving to Leonard the exposed position.  As\r\nsoon as he was seated, she began:\n\n'Now, Leonard, tell me all about the debts?'  She spoke in tones of gay\nfriendliness, but behind the mask of her cheerfulness was the real face\nof fear.  Down deep in her mind was a conviction that her letter was a\npivotal point of future sorrow.  It was in the meantime quite apparent to\nher that Leonard kept it as his last resource; so her instinct was to\nkeep it to the front and thus minimise its power.\n\nLeonard, though inwardly weakened by qualms of growing doubt, had the\r\nanimal instinct that, as he was in opposition, his safety was in\nattacking where his opponent most feared.  He felt that there was some\nsubtle change in his companion; this was never the same Stephen Norman\nwhom only yesterday he had met upon the hill!  He plunged at once into\nhis purpose.\n\n'But it wasn't about my debts you asked me to meet you, Stephen.'\n\n'You surprise me, Leonard!  I thought I simply asked you to come to meet\nme.  I know the first subject I mentioned when we began to talk, after\nyour grumbling about coming in the heat, was your money matters.'  Leonard","winced, but went on:\n\n'It was very good of you, Stephen; but really that is not what I came to\nspeak of to-day.  At first, at all events!' he added with a sublime\nnaivette, as the subject of his debts and his imperative want of money\nrose before him.  Stephen's eyes flashed; she saw more clearly than ever\nthrough his purpose.  Such as admission at the very outset of the proffer\nof marriage, which she felt was coming, was little short of monstrous.\nHer companion did not see the look of mastery on her face; he was looking\r\ndown at the moment.  A true lover would have been looking up.\n\n'I wanted to tell you, Stephen, that I have been thinking over what you\nsaid to me in your letter, and what you said in words; and I want to\naccept!'  As he was speaking he was looking her straight in the face.\n\nStephen answered slowly with a puzzled smile which wrinkled up her\nforehead:\n\n'Accept what I said in my letter! why, Leonard, what do you mean?  That\nletter must have had a lot more in it than I thought.  I seem to remember\nthat it was simply a line asking you to meet me.  Just let me look at it;\r\nI should like to be sure of what actually is!'  As she spoke she held out\nher hand.  Leonard was nonplussed; he did not know what to say.  Stephen\nmade up her mind to have the letter back.  Leonard was chafing under the\nposition forced upon him, and tried to divert his companion from her\npurpose.  He knew well why she had chosen that exposed position for their\ninterview.  Now, as her outstretched hand embarrassed him, he made\nreprisal; he tried to take it in his in a tender manner.\n\nShe instantly drew back her hand and put it behind her in a decided\r\nmanner.  She was determined that whatever might happen she would not let\nany watcher at the windows, by chance or otherwise, see any sign of\ntenderness on her part.  Leonard, thinking that his purpose had been\neffected, went on, breathing more freely:\n\n'Your letter wasn't much.  Except of course that it gave me the\nopportunity of listening to what you said; to all your sweet words.  To\nyour more than sweet proposal!'\n\n'Yes!  It must have been sweet to have any one, who was in a position to\ndo so, offer to help you when you knew that you were overwhelmed with","debts!'  The words were brutal.  Stephen felt so; but she had no\nalternative.  Leonard had some of the hard side of human nature; but he\nhad also some of the weak side.  He went on blindly:\n\n'I have been thinking ever since of what you said, and I want to tell you\nthat I would like to do as you wish!'  As he spoke, his words seemed even\nto him to be out of place.  He felt it would be necessary to throw more\nfervour into the proceedings.  The sudden outburst which followed\nactually amused Stephen, even in her state of fear:\r\n'Oh, Stephen, don't you know that I love you!  You are so beautiful!  I\nlove you!  I love you!  Won't you be my wife?'\n\nThis was getting too much to close quarters.  Stephen said in a calm,\nbusiness-like way:\n\n'My dear Leonard, one thing at a time!  I came out here, you know, to\nspeak of your debts; and until that is done, I really won't go into any\nother matter.  Of course if you'd rather not . . . '  Leonard really\ncould not afford this; matters were too pressing with him.  So he tried\nto affect a cheery manner; but in his heart was a black resolve that she\r\nshould yet pay for this.\n\n'All right! Stephen.  Whatever you wish I will do; you are the queen of\nmy heart, you know!'\n\n'How much is the total amount?' said Stephen.\n\nThis was a change to the prosaic which made sentiment impossible.  He\ngave over, for the time.\n\n'Go on!' said Stephen, following up her advantage.  'Don't you even know\nhow much you owe?'\n\n'The fact is, I don't.  Not exactly.  I shall make up the amount as well\nas I can and let you know.  But that's not what I came about to-day.'\nStephen was going to make an angry gesture of dissent.  She was not going\r\nto have that matter opened up.  She waited, however, for Leonard was\ngoing on after his momentary pause.  She breathed more freely after his\nfirst sentence.  He was unable evidently to carry on a double train of\nthought.\n\n'It was about that infernal money-lenders' letter that the Governor got!'\nStephen got still less anxious.  This open acknowledgment of his true\npurpose seemed to clear the air.\n\n'What is the amount?'  Leonard looked quickly at her; the relief of her\nmind made her tone seem joyful.","'A monkey!  Five hundred pounds, you know.  But then there's three\nhundred for interest that has to be paid also.  It's an awful lot of\nmoney, isn't it?'  The last phrase was added on seeing Stephen's\nsurprised look.\n\n'Yes!' she answered quietly.  'A great deal of money--to waste!'  They\nwere both silent for a while.  Then she said:\n\n'What does your father say to it?'\n\n'He was in an awful wax.  One of these beastly duns had written to him\nabout another account and he was in a regular fury.  When I told him I\r\nwould pay it within a week, he said very little, which was suspicious;\nand then, just when I was going out, he sprung this on me.  Mean of him!\nwasn't it?  I need expect no help from him.'  As he was speaking he took\na mass of letters from his pocket and began to look among them for the\nmoney-lenders' letter.\n\n'Why, what a correspondence you have there.  Do you keep all your letters\nin your pockets?' said Stephen quietly.\n\n'All I don't tear up or burn.  It wouldn't do to let the Governor into my\nsecrets.  He might know too much!'\n\n'And are all those letters from duns?'\r\n'Mostly, but I only keep those letters I have to attend to and those I\ncare for.'\n\n'Show me the bundle!' she said.  Then seeing him hesitate, added:\n\n'You know if I am to help you to get clear you must take me into your\nconfidence.  I dare say I shall have to see a lot more letters than these\nbefore you are quite clear!'  Her tone was too quiet.  Knowing already\nthe silent antagonism between them he began to suspect her; knowing also\nthat her own letter was not amongst them, he used his wits and handed\r\nthem over without a word.  She, too, suspected him.  After his tacit\nrefusal to give her the letter, she almost took it for granted that it\nwas not amongst them.  She gave no evidence of her feeling, however, but\nopened and read the letters in due sequence; all save two, which, being\nin a female hand, she gave back without a word.  There was a calmness and\nan utter absence of concern, much less of jealousy, about this which\ndisconcerted him.  Throughout her reading Stephen's face showed surprise\nnow and again; but when she came to the last, which was that of the","usurers, it showed alarm.  Being a woman, a legal threat had certain\nfears of its own.\n\n'There must be no delay about this!' she said.\n\n'What am I to do?' he answered, a weight off his mind that the fiscal\nmatter had been practically entered on.\n\n'I shall see that you get the money!' she said quietly.  'It will be\nreally a gift, but I prefer it to be as a loan for many reasons.'  Leonard\nmade no comment.   He found so many reasons in his own mind that he\nthought it wise to forbear from asking any of hers.  Then she took the\npractical matter in hand:\r\n'You must wire to these people at once to say that you will pay the\namount on the day after to-morrow.  If you will come here to-morrow at\nfour o'clock the money will be ready for you.  You can go up to town by\nthe evening train and pay off the debt first thing in the morning.  When\nyou bring the receipt I shall speak to you about the other debts; but you\nmust make out a full list of them.  We can't have any half-measure.  I\nwill not go into the matter till I have all the details before me!'  Then\nshe stood up to go.\n\nAs they walked across the lawn, she said:\r\n'By the way, don't forget to bring that letter with you.  I want to see\nwhat I really did say in it!'  Her tone was quiet enough, and the wording\nwas a request; but Leonard knew as well as if it had been spoken outright\nas a threat that if he did not have the letter with him when he came\nthings were likely to be unpleasant.\n\nThe farther he got from Normanstand on his way home the more discontented\nLeonard grew.  Whilst he had been in Stephen's presence she had so\ndominated him, not only by her personality but by her use of her\r\nknowledge of his own circumstances, that he had not dared to make protest\nor opposition; but now he began to feel how much less he was to receive\nthan he had expected.  He had come prepared to allow Stephen to fall into\nhis arms, fortune and all.  But now, although he had practical assurance\nthat the weight of his debts would be taken from him, he was going away\nwith his tail between his legs.  He had not even been accepted as a\nsuitor, he who had himself been wooed only a day before.  His proposal of\nmarriage had not been accepted, had not even been considered by the woman","who had so lately broken ironclad convention to propose marriage to him.\nHe had been treated merely as a scapegrace debtor who had come to ask\nfavours from an old friend.  He had even been treated like a bad boy; had\nbeen told that he had wasted money; had been ordered, in no doubtful way,\nto bring the full schedule of his debts.  And all the time he dared not\nsay anything lest the thing shouldn't come off at all.  Stephen had such\nan infernally masterly way with her!  It didn't matter whether she was\nproposing to him, or he was proposing to her, he was made to feel small\r\nall the same.  He would have to put up with it till he had got rid of the\ndebts!\n\nAnd then as to the letter.  Why was she so persistent about seeing it?\nDid she want to get it into her hands and then keep it, as Harold An Wolf\nhad done?  Was it possible that she suspected he would use it to coerce\nher; she would call it 'blackmail,' he supposed.  This being the very\nthing he had intended to do, and had done, he grew very indignant at the\nvery thought of being accused of it.  It was, he felt, a very awkward\r\nthing that he had lost possession of the letter.  He might need it if\nStephen got nasty.  Then Harold might give it to her, as he had\nthreatened to do.  He thought he would call round that evening by\nHarold's house, and see if he couldn't get back the letter.  It belonged\nto him; Harold had no right to keep it.  He would see him before he and\nStephen got putting their heads together.  So, on his way home, he turned\nhis steps at once to Harold's house.\n\nHe did not find him in.  The maid who opened the door could give him no\ninformation; all she could say was that Mrs. Dingle the housekeeper had\r\ngot a telegram from Master saying that he had been called suddenly away\non business.\n\nThis was a new source of concern to Leonard.  He suspected a motive of\nsome sort; though what that motive could be he could not hazard the\nwildest guess.  On his way home he called at the post-office and sent a\ntelegram to Cavendish and Cecil, the name of the usurers' firm, in\naccordance with Stephen's direction.  He signed it: 'Jasper Everard.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII--A BUSINESS TRANSACTION\n\n\nWhen Stephen had sent off her letter to the bank she went out for a","stroll; she knew it would be no use trying to get rest before dinner.\nThat ordeal, too, had to be gone through.  She found herself\nunconsciously going in the direction of the grove; but when she became\naware of it a great revulsion overcame her, and she shuddered.\n\nSlowly she took her way across the hard stretch of finely-kept grass\nwhich lay on the side of the house away from the wood.  The green sward\nlay like a sea, dotted with huge trees, singly, or in clumps as islands.\nIn its far-stretching stateliness there was something soothing.  She came\r\nback to the sound of the dressing-gong with a better strength to resist\nthe trial before her.  Well she knew her aunt would have something to say\non the subject of her interference in Leonard Everard's affairs.\n\nHer fears were justified, for when they had come into the drawing-room\nafter dinner Miss Rowly began:\n\n'Stephen dear, is it not unwise of you to interfere in Mr. Everard's\naffairs?'\n\n'Why unwise, Auntie?'\n\n'Well, my dear, the world is censorious.  And when a young lady, of your\nposition and your wealth, takes a part in a young man's affairs tongues\r\nare apt to wag.  And also, dear, debts, young men's debts, are hardly the\nsubjects for a girl's investigation.  Remember, that we ladies live very\ndifferent lives from men; from some men, I should say, for your dear\nfather was the best of men, and I should think that in all his life there\nwas nothing which he would have wished concealed.  But, my dear, young\nmen are less restrained in their ways than we are, than we have to be for\nour own safety and protection.'  The poor lady was greatly perturbed at\r\nhaving to speak in such a way.  Stephen saw her distress; coming over to\nher, she sat down and took her hand.  Stephen had a very tender side to\nher nature, and she loved very truly the dear old lady who had taken her\nmother's place and had shown her all a mother's love.  Now, in her\nloneliness and woe and fear, she clung to her in spirit.  She would have\nliked to have clung to her physically; to have laid her head on her\nbosom, and have cried her heart out.  The time for tears had not come.\nHourly she felt more and more the weight that a shameful secret is to","carry.  She knew, however, that she could set her aunt's mind at rest on\nthe present subject; so she said:\n\n'I think you are right, Auntie dear.  It would have been better if I had\nasked you first; but I saw that Leonard was in distress, and wormed the\ncause of it from him.  When I heard that it was only debt I offered to\nhelp him.  He is an old friend, you know, Auntie.  We were children\ntogether; and as I have much more money than I can ever want or spend, I\nthought I might help him.  I am afraid I have let myself in for a bigger\r\nthing than I intended; but as I have promised I must go on with it.  I\ndare say, Auntie, that you are afraid that I may end by getting in love\nwith him, and marrying him.  Don't you, dear?'  This was said with a hug\nand a kiss which gave the old lady delight.  Her instinct told her what\nwas coming.  She nodded her head in acquiescence.  Stephen went on\ngravely:\n\n'Put any such fear out of your mind.  I shall never marry him.  I can\nnever love him.'  She was going to say 'could never love him,' when she\nremembered.\n\n'Are you sure, my dear?  The heart is not always under one's own\r\ncontrol.'\n\n'Quite sure, Auntie.  I know Leonard Everard; and though I have always\nliked him, I do not respect him.  Why, the very fact of his coming to me\nfor money would make me reconsider any view I had formed, had nothing\nelse ever done so.  You may take it, Auntie dear, that in the way you\nmean Leonard is nothing to me; can never be anything to me!'  Here a\nsudden inspiration took her.  In its light a serious difficulty passed,\nand the doing of a thing which had a fear of its own became easy.  With a\nconviction in her tone, which in itself aided her immediate purpose, she\r\nsaid:\n\n'I shall prove it to you.  That is, if you will not mind doing something\nwhich will save me an embarrassment.'\n\n'You know I will do anything, my dearest, which an old woman can do for a\nyoung one!'  Stephen squeezed the mittened hand which she held as she\nwent on:\n\n'As I said, I have promised to lend him some money.  The first instalment\nis to be given him to-morrow; he is to call for it in the afternoon.  Will\nyou give it to him for me?'\n\n'Gladly, my dear,' said the old lady, much relieved.  Stephen continued:","'One other thing, Auntie, I want you to do for me: not to think of the\namount, or to say a word to me about it.  It is a large sum, and I dare\nsay it will frighten you a little.  But I have made up my mind to it.  I\nam learning a great deal out of this, Auntie dear; and I am quite willing\nto pay for my knowledge.  After all, money is the easiest and cheapest\nway of paying for knowledge!  Don't you agree with me?'\n\nMiss Rowly gulped down her disappointment.  She felt that she ought not\nto say too much, now that Stephen had set aside her graver fears.  She\r\nconsoled herself with the thought that even a large amount of money would\ncause no inconvenience to so wealthy a woman as Stephen.  Beyond this, as\nshe would have the handing over of the money to Leonard, she would know\nthe amount.  If advisable, she could remonstrate.  She could if necessary\nconsult, in confidence, with Harold.  Her relief from her greater fear,\nand her gladness at this new proof of her niece's confidence, were\nmanifested in the extra affection with which she bade her good-night.\r\nStephen did not dare to breathe freely till she was quite alone; and as\nshe lay quiet in her bed in the dark she thought before sleep came.\n\nHer first feeling was one of thankfulness that immediate danger was\nswerving from her.  Things were so shaping themselves that she need not\nhave any fear concerning Leonard.  For his own sake he would have to keep\nsilent.  If he intended to blackmail her she would have the protection of\nher aunt's knowledge of the loan, and of her participation in it.  The\nonly weapon that remained to him was her letter; and that she would get\r\nfrom him before furnishing the money for the payment of his other debts.\n\nThese things out of the way, her thoughts turned to the matter of the\ngreater dread; that of which all along she had feared to think for a\nmoment: Harold!\n\nHarold! and her treatment of him!\n\nThe first reception of the idea was positive anguish.  From the moment he\nhad left her till now there had been no time when a consideration of the\nmatter was possible.  Time pressed, or circumstances had interfered, or\nher own personal condition had forbidden.  Now, when she was alone, the","whole awful truth burst on her like an avalanche.  Stephen felt the issue\nof her thinking before the thinking itself was accomplished; and it was\nwith a smothered groan that she, in the darkness, held up her arms with\nfingers linked in desperate concentration of appeal.\n\nOh, if she could only take back one hour of her life, well she knew what\nthat hour would be!  Even that shameful time with Leonard on the hill-top\nseemed innocuous beside the degrading remembrance of her conduct to the\nnoble friend of her whole life.\n\nSadly she turned over in her bed, and with shut eyes put her burning face\r\non the pillow, to hide, as it were, from herself her abject depth of\nshame.\n\nLeonard lounged through the next morning with what patience he could.  At\nfour o'clock he was at the door of Normanstand in his dogcart.  This time\nhe had a groom with him and a suitcase packed for a night's use, as he\nwas to go on to London after his interview with Stephen.  He had lost\nsight altogether of the matter of Stephen's letter, or else he would have\nbeen more nervous.\n\nHe was taken into the blue drawing-room, where shortly Miss Rowly joined\r\nhim.  He had not expected this.  His mental uneasiness manifested itself\nin his manner, and his fidgeting was not unobserved by the astute old\nlady.  He was disconcerted; 'overwhelmed' would better have described his\nfeelings when she said:\n\n'Miss Norman is sorry she can't see you to-day as she is making a visit;\nbut she has given me a message for you, or rather a commission to\ndischarge.  Perhaps you had better sit down at the table; there are\nwriting materials there, and I shall want a receipt of some sort.'\r\n'Stephen did not say anything about a receipt!'  The other smiled sweetly\nas she said in a calm way:\n\n'But unfortunately Miss Norman is not here; and so I have to do the best\nI can.  I really must have some proof that I have fulfilled my trust.  You\nsee, Mr. Everard, though it is what lawyers call a \"friendly\"\ntransaction, it is more or less a business act; and I must protect\nmyself.'\n\nLeonard saw that he must comply, for time pressed.  He sat down at the\ntable.  Taking up a pen and drawing a sheet of paper towards him, he said\nwith what command of his voice he could:","'What am I to write?'  The old lady took from her basket a folded sheet\nof notepaper, and, putting on her reading-glasses, said as she smoothed\nit out:\n\n'I think it would be well to say something like this--\"I, Leonard\nEverard, of Brindehow, in the Parish of Normanstand, in the County of\nNorcester, hereby acknowledge the receipt from Miss Laetitia Rowly of\nnine hundred pounds sterling lent to me in accordance with my request,\nthe same being to clear me of a pressing debt due by me.'\n\nWhen he had finished writing the receipt Miss Rowly looked it over, and\r\nhanding it back to him, said:\n\n'Now sign; and date!'  He did so with suppressed anger.\n\nShe folded the document carefully and put it in her pocket.  Then taking\nfrom the little pouch which she wore at her belt a roll of notes, she\ncounted out on the table nine notes of one hundred pounds each.  As she\nput down the last she said:\n\n'Miss Norman asked me to say that a hundred pounds is added to the sum\nyou specified to her, as doubtless the usurers would, since you are\nactually behind the time promised for repayment, require something extra\r\nas a solatium or to avoid legal proceedings already undertaken.  In fact\nthat they would \"put more salt on your tail.\"  The expression, I regret\nto say, is not mine.'\n\nLeonard folded up the notes, put them into his pocket-book, and walked\naway.  He did not feel like adding verbal thanks to the document already\nsigned.  As he got near the door the thought struck him; turning back he\nsaid:\n\n'May I ask if Stephen said anything about getting the document?'\n\n'I beg your pardon,' she said icily, 'did you speak of any one?'\r\n'Miss Norman, I meant!'  Miss Rowly's answer to this came so smartly that\nit left an added sting.  Her arrow was fledged with two feathers so that\nit must shoot true: her distrust of him and his own impotence.\n\n'Oh no!  Miss Norman knows nothing of this.  She simply asked me to give\nyou the money.  This is my own doing entirely.  You see, I must exercise\nmy judgment on my dear niece's behalf.  Of course it may not be necessary\nto show her the receipt; but if it should ever be advisable it is always\nthere.'\n\nHe looked at her with anger, not unmixed with admiration, as, bowing","rather lower than necessary, he went out of the door, saying sotto voce,\nbetween his teeth:\n\n'When my turn comes out you go!  Neck and crop!  Quick!  Normanstand\nisn't big enough to hold us both!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII--MORE BUSINESS\n\n\nWhen Leonard tendered the eight hundred pounds in payment of his debt of\nfive hundred, Mr. Cavendish at first refused to take it.  But when\nLeonard calmly but firmly refused to pay a single penny beyond the\nobligations already incurred, including interest on the full sum for one\nday, he acquiesced.  He knew the type of man fully; and knew also that in\r\nall probability it would not be long before he would come to the Firm\nagain on a borrowing errand.  When such time should come, he would put an\nextra clause into his Memorandum of Agreement which would allow the Firm\nfull power to make whatever extra charge they might choose in case of the\nslightest default in making payment.\n\nLeonard's visits to town had not of late been many, and such as he had\nhad were not accompanied with a plethora of cash.  He now felt that he\nhad earned a holiday; and it was not till the third morning that he\r\nreturned to Brindehow.  His father made no comment on his absence; his\nonly allusion to the subject was:\n\n'Back all right!  Any news in town?'  There was, however, an unwonted\nsuavity in his manner which made Leonard a little anxious.  He busied\nhimself for the balance of the morning in getting together all his unpaid\naccounts and making a schedule of them.  The total at first amazed almost\nas much as it frightened him.  He feared what Stephen would say.  She had\nalready commented unfavourably on the one amount she had seen.  When she\r\nwas face to face with this she might refuse to pay altogether.  It would\ntherefore be wise to propitiate her.  What could he do in this direction?\nHis thoughts naturally turned to the missing letter.  If he could get\npossession of it, it would either serve as a sop or a threat.  In the one\ncase she would be so glad to have it back that she would not stick at a\nfew pounds; in the other it would 'bring her to her senses' as he put in\nhis own mind his intention of blackmail.\n\nHe was getting so tightened up in situation that as yet he could only do","as he was told, and keep his temper as well as he could.\n\nAltogether it was in a chastened mood that he made his appearance at\nNormanstand later in the afternoon.  He was evidently expected, for he\nwas shown into the study without a word.  Here Miss Rowly and Stephen\njoined him.  Both were very kind in manner.  After the usual greetings\nand commonplaces Stephen said in a brisk, businesslike way:\n\n'Have you the papers with you?'  He took the bundle of accounts from his\npocket and handed them to her.  After his previous experience he would\r\nhave suggested, had he dared, that he should see Stephen alone; but he\nfeared the old lady.  He therefore merely said:\n\n'I am afraid you will find the amount very large.  But I have put down\neverything!'\n\nSo he had; and more than everything.  At the last an idea struck him that\nas he was getting so much he might as well have a little more.  He\ntherefore added several good-sized amounts which he called 'debts of\nhonour.'  This would, he thought, appeal to the feminine mind.  Stephen\ndid not look at the papers at once.  She stood up, holding them, and said\nto Miss Rowly:\r\n'Now, if you will talk to Mr. Everard I will go over these documents\nquietly by myself.  When I have been through them and understand them all\nI shall come back; and we will see what can be done.'  She moved\ngracefully out of the room, closing the door behind her.  As is usual\nwith women, she had more than one motive for her action in going away.  In\nthe first place, she wished to be alone whilst she went over the schedule\nof the debts.  She feared she might get angry; and in the present state\nof her mind towards Leonard the expression of any feeling, even contempt,\r\nwould not be wise.  Her best protection from him would be a manifest\nkindly negation of any special interest.  In the second place, she\nbelieved that he would have her letter with the other papers, and she did\nnot wish her aunt to see it, lest she should recognise the writing.  In\nher boudoir, with a beating heart, she untied the string and looked\nthrough the papers.\n\nHer letter was not among them.\n\nFor a few seconds she stood stock still, thinking.  Then, with a sigh,\nshe sat down and began to read the list of debts, turning to the","originals now and again for details.  As she went on, her wonder and\ndisgust grew; and even a sense of fear came into her thoughts.  A man who\ncould be so wildly reckless and so selfishly unscrupulous was to be\nfeared.  She knew his father was a comparatively poor man, who could not\npossibly meet such a burden.  If he were thus to his father, what might\nhe be to her if he got a chance.\n\nThe thought of what he might have been to her, had he taken the chance\nshe had given him, never occurred to her.  This possibility had already\nreached the historical stage in her mind.\r\nShe made a few pencil notes on the list; and went back to the study.  Her\nmind was made up.\n\nShe was quite businesslike and calm, did not manifest the slightest\ndisapproval, but seemed to simply accept everything as facts.  She asked\nLeonard a few questions on subjects regarding which she had made notes,\nsuch as discounts.  Then she held the paper out to him and without any\npreliminary remark said:\n\n'Will you please put the names to these?'\n\n'How do you mean?' he asked, flushing.\n\n'The names of the persons to whom these sums marked \"debt of honour\" are\r\ndue.'  His reply came quickly, and was a little aggressive; he thought\nthis might be a good time to make a bluff:\n\n'I do not see that that is necessary.  I can settle them when I have the\nmoney.'  Slowly and without either pause or flurry Stephen replied,\nlooking him straight in the eyes as she handed him the papers:\n\n'Of course it is not necessary!  Few things in the world really are!  I\nonly wanted to help you out of your troubles; but if you do not wish me\nto . . . !'  Leonard interrupted in alarm:\r\n'No! no!  I only spoke of these items.  You see, being \"debts of honour\"\nI ought not to give the names.'  Looking with a keen glance at her set\nface he saw she was obdurate; and, recognising his defeat, said as calmly\nas he could, for he felt raging:\n\n'All right!  Give me the paper!'  Bending over the table he wrote.  When\nshe took the paper, a look half surprised, half indignant, passed over\nher face.  Her watchful aunt saw it, and bending over looked also at the\npaper.  Then she too smiled bitterly.\n\nLeonard had printed in the names!  The feminine keenness of both women","had made his intention manifest.  He did not wish for the possibility of\nhis handwriting being recognised.  His punishment came quickly.  With a\ndazzling smile Stephen said to him:\n\n'But, Leonard, you have forgotten to put the addresses!'\n\n'Is that necessary?'\n\n'Of course it is!  Why, you silly, how is the money to be paid if there\nare no addresses?'\n\nLeonard felt like a rat in a trap; but he had no alternative.  So\nirritated was he, and so anxious to hide his irritation that, forgetting\nhis own caution, he wrote, not in printing characters but in his own\r\nhandwriting, addresses evolved from his own imagination.  Stephen's eyes\ntwinkled as he handed her the paper: he had given himself away all round.\n\nLeonard having done all that as yet had been required of him, felt that\nhe might now ask a further favour, so he said:\n\n'There is one of those bills which I have promised to pay by Monday.'\n\n'Promised?' said Stephen with wide-opened eyes.  She had no idea of\nsparing him, she remembered the printed names.  'Why, Leonard, I thought\nyou said you were unable to pay any of those debts?'\r\nAgain he had put himself in a false position.  He could not say that it\nwas to his father he had made the promise; for he had already told\nStephen that he had been afraid to tell him of his debts.  In his\ndesperation, for Miss Rowly's remorseless glasses were full on him, he\nsaid:\n\n'I thought I was justified in making the promise after what you said\nabout the pleasure it would be to help me.  You remember, that day on the\nhilltop?'\n\nIf he had wished to disconcert her he was mistaken; she had already\nthought over and over again of every form of embarrassment her unhappy\r\naction might bring on her at his hands.  She now said sweetly and calmly,\nso sweetly and so calmly that he, with knowledge of her secret, was\nalarmed:\n\n'But that was not a promise to pay.  If you will remember it was only an\noffer, which is a very different thing.  You did not accept it then!'  She\nwas herself somewhat desperate, or she would not have sailed so close to\nthe wind.\n\n'Ah, but I accepted later!' he said quickly, feeling in his satisfaction\nin an epigrammatic answer a certain measure of victory.  He felt his","mistake when she went on calmly:\n\n'Offers like that are not repeated.  They are but phantoms, after all.\nThey come at their own choice, when they do come; and they stay but the\nmeasure of a breath or two.  You cannot summon them!'  Leonard fell into\nthe current of the metaphor and answered:\n\n'I don't know that even that is impossible.  There are spells which call,\nand recall, even phantoms!'\n\n'Indeed!'  Stephen was anxious to find his purpose.\n\nLeonard felt that he was getting on, that he was again acquiring the\r\nupper hand; so he pushed on the metaphor, more and more satisfied with\nhimself:\n\n'And it is wonderful how simple some spells, and these the most powerful,\ncan be.  A remembered phrase, the recollection of a pleasant meeting, the\nsmell of a forgotten flower, or the sight of a forgotten letter; any or\nall of these can, through memory, bring back the past.  And it is often\nin the past that the secret of the future lies!'\n\nMiss Rowly felt that something was going on before her which she could\nnot understand.  Anything of this man's saying which she could not fathom\r\nmust be at least dangerous; so she determined to spoil his purpose,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n'Dear me!  That is charmingly poetic!  Past and future; memory and the\nsmell of flowers; meetings and letters!  It is quite philosophy.  Do\nexplain it all, Mr. Everard!'  Leonard was not prepared to go on under\nthe circumstances.  His own mention of 'letter,' although he had\ndeliberately used it with the intention of frightening Stephen, had\nfrightened himself.  It reminded him that he had not brought, had not\ngot, the letter; and that as yet he was not certain of getting the money.\r\nStephen also had noted the word, and determined not to pass the matter\nby.  She said gaily:\n\n'If a letter is a spell, I think you have a spell of mine, which is a\nspell of my own weaving.  You were to show me the letter in which I asked\nyou to come to see me.  It was in that, I think you said, that I\nmentioned your debts; but I don't remember doing so.  Show it to me!'\n\n'I have not got it with me!'  This was said with mulish sullenness.\n\n'Why not?'\n\n'I forgot.'\n\n'That is a pity!  It is always a pity to forget things in a business","transaction; as this is.  I think, Auntie, we must wait till we have all\nthe documents, before we can complete this transaction!'\n\nLeonard was seriously alarmed.  If the matter of the loan were not gone\non with at once the jeweller's bill could not be paid by Monday, and the\nresult would be another scene with his father.  He turned to Stephen and\nsaid as charmingly as he could, and he was all in earnest now:\n\n'I'm awfully sorry!  But these debts have been so worrying me that they\nput lots of things out of my head.  That bill to be paid on Monday, when\r\nI haven't a feather to fly with, is enough to drive a fellow off his\nchump.  The moment I lay my hands on the letter I shall keep it with me\nso that I can't forget it again.  Won't you forgive me for this time?'\n\n'Forgive!' she answered, with a laugh.  'Why it's not worth forgiveness!\nIt is not worth a second thought!  All right!  Leonard, make your mind\neasy; the bill will be paid on Monday!'  Miss Rowly said quietly:\n\n'I have to be in London on Monday afternoon; I can pay it for you.'  This\nwas a shock to Leonard; he said impulsively:\r\n'Oh, I say!  Can't I . . . '  His words faded away as the old lady again\nraised her lorgnon and gazed at him calmly.  She went on:\n\n'You know, my dear, it won't be even out of my way, as I have to call at\nMr. Malpas's office, and I can go there from the hotel in Regent Street.'\nThis was all news to Stephen.  She did not know that her aunt had\nintended going to London; and indeed she did not know of any business\nwith Mr. Malpas, whose firm had been London solicitor to the Rowlys for\nseveral generations.  She had no doubt, however, as to the old lady's\r\nintention.  It was plain to her that she wanted to help.  So she thanked\nher sweetly.  Leonard could say nothing.  He seemed to be left completely\nout of it.  When Stephen rose, as a hint to him that it was time for him\nto go, he said humbly, as he left:\n\n'Would it be possible that I should have the receipt before Monday\nevening?  I want to show it to my father.'\n\n'Certainly!' said the old lady, answering him.  'I shall be back by the\ntwo o'clock train; and if you happen to be at the railway station at\nNorcester when I arrive I can give it to you!'","He went away relieved, but vindictive; determined in his own mind that\nwhen he had received the money for the rest of the debts he would see\nStephen, when the old lady was not present, and have it out with her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX--A LETTER\n\n\nOn Monday evening after dinner Mr. Everard and his son sat for a while in\nsilence.  They had not met since morning; and in the presence of the\nservants conversation had been scrupulously polite.  Now, though they\nwere both waiting to talk, neither liked to begin.  The older man was\noutwardly placid, when Leonard, a little flushed and a little nervous of\r\nvoice, began:\n\n'Have you had any more bills?'  He had expected none, and thus hoped to\nbegin by scoring against his father.  It was something of a set-down when\nthe latter, taking some papers from his breast-pocket, handed them to\nhim, saying:\n\n'Only these!'  Leonard took them in silence and looked at them.  All were\nrequests for payment of debts due by his son.\n\nIn each case the full bill was enclosed.  He was silent a while; but his\nfather spoke:\n\n'It would almost seem as if all these people had made up their minds that\r\nyou were of no further use to them.'  Then without pausing he said, but\nin a sharper voice:\n\n'Have you paid the jewellers?  This is Monday!'  Without speaking Leonard\ntook leisurely from his pocket folded paper.  This he opened, and, after\ndeliberately smoothing out the folds, handed it to his father.  Doubtless\nsomething in his manner had already convinced the latter that the debt\nwas paid.  He took the paper in as leisurely a way as it had been given,\nadjusted his spectacles, and read it.  Seeing that his son had scored\r\nthis time, he covered his chagrin with an appearance of paternal\nsatisfaction.\n\n'Good!'  For many reasons he was glad the debt was paid He was himself\ntoo poor a man to allow the constant drain his son's debts, and too\ncareful of his position to be willing have such exposure as would come\nwith a County Court action against his son.  All the same, his\nexasperation continued.  Neither was his quiver yet empty.  He shot his\nnext arrow:\n\n'I am glad you paid off those usurers!'  Leonard did not like the\ndefinite way he spoke.  Still in silence, he took from his pocket a","second paper, which he handed over unfolded.  Mr. Everard read it, and\nreturned it politely, with again one word:\n\n'Good!'  For a few minutes there was silence.  The father spoke again:\n\n'Those other debts, have you paid them?'  With a calm deliberation so\nfull of tacit rudeness that it made his father flush Leonard answered:\n\n'Not yet, sir!  But I shall think of them presently.  I don't care to be\nbustled by them; and I don't mean to!'  It was apparent that though he\nspoke verbally of his creditors, his meaning was with regard to others\r\nalso.\n\n'When will they be paid?'  As his son hesitated, he went on:\n\n'I am alluding to those who have written to me.  I take it that as my\nestate is not entailed, and as you have no income except from me, the\ncredit which has been extended to you has been rather on my account than\nyour own.  Therefore, as the matter touches my own name, I am entitled to\nknow something of what is going on.'  His manner as well as his words was\nso threatening that Leonard was a little afraid.  He might imperil his\ninheritance.  He answered quickly:\r\n'Of course, sir, you shall know everything.  After all, you know, my\naffairs are your affairs!'\n\n'I know nothing of the sort.  I may of course be annoyed by your affairs,\neven dishonoured, in a way, by them.  But I accept no responsibility\nwhatever.  As you have made your bed, so must you lie on it!'\n\n'It's all right, sir, I assure you.  All my debts, both those you know of\nand some you don't, I shall settle very shortly.'\n\n'How soon?'  The question was sternly put.\n\n'In a few days.  I dare say a week at furthest will see everything\nstraightened out.'\r\nThe elder man stood, saying gravely as he went to the door:\n\n'You will do well to tell me when the last of them is paid.  There is\nsomething which I shall then want to tell you!'  Without waiting for\nreply he went to his study.\n\nLeonard went to his room and made a systematic, though unavailing, search\nfor Stephen's letter; thinking that by some chance he might have\nrecovered it from Harold and had overlooked it.\n\nThe next few days he passed in considerable suspense.  He did not dare go\nnear Normanstand until he was summoned, as he knew he would be when he","was required.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen Miss Rowly returned from her visit to London she told Stephen that\nshe had paid the bill at the jeweller's, and had taken the precaution of\ngetting a receipt, together with a duplicate for Mr. Everard.  The\noriginal was by her own request made out as received from Miss Laetitia\nRowly in settlement of the account of Leonard Everard, Esq.; the\nduplicate merely was 'recd. in settlement of the account of--,' etc.\nStephen's brows bent hit thought as she said:\n\n'Why did you have it done that way, Auntie dear?'  The other answered\r\nquietly:\n\n'I had a reason, my dear; good reason!  Perhaps I shall tell you all\nabout it some day; in the meantime I want you not to ask me anything\nabout it.  I have a reason for that too.  Stephen, won't you trust me in\nthis, blindfold?'  There was something so sweet and loving in the way she\nmade the request that Stephen was filled with emotion.  She put her arms\nround her aunt's neck and hugged her tight.  Then laying her head on her\nbosom she said with a sigh:\n\n'Oh, my dear, you can't know how I trust you; or how much your trust is\r\nto me.  You never can know!'\n\nThe next day the two women held a long consultation over the schedule of\nLeonard's debts.  Neither said a word of disfavour, or even commented on\nthe magnitude.  The only remark touching on the subject was made by Miss\nRowly:\n\n'We must ask for proper discounts.  Oh, the villainy of those tradesmen!\nI do believe they charge double in the hope of getting half.  As to\njewellers . . . !'  Then she announced her intention of going up to town\nagain on Thursday, at which visit she would arrange for the payment of\r\nthe various debts.  Stephen tried to remonstrate, but she was obdurate.\nShe held Stephen's hand in hers and stroked it lovingly as she kept on\nrepeating:\n\n'Leave it all to me, dear!  Leave it all to me!  Everything shall be paid\nas you wish; but leave it to me!'\n\nStephen acquiesced.  This gentle yielding was new in her; it touched the\nelder lady to the quick, even whilst it pained her.  Well she knew that\nsome trouble must have gone to the smoothing of that imperious nature.\n\nStephen's inner life in these last few days was so bitterly sad that she","kept it apart from all the routine of social existence.  Into it never\ncame now, except as the exciting cause of all the evil, a thought of\nLeonard.  The saddening memory was of Harold.  And of him the sadness was\nincreased and multiplied by a haunting fear.  Since he had walked out of\nthe grove she had not seen him nor heard from him.  This was in itself\nstrange; for in all her life, when she was at home and he too, never a\nday passed without her seeing him.  She had heard her aunt say that word\nhad come of his having made a sudden journey to London, from which he had\r\nnot yet returned.  She was afraid to make inquiries.  Partly lest she\nmight hear bad news--this was her secret fear; partly lest she might\nbring some attention to herself in connection with his going.  Of some\nthings in connection with her conduct to him she was afraid to think at\nall.  Thought, she felt, would come in time, and with it new pains and\nnew shames, of which as yet she dared not think.\n\nOne morning came an envelope directed in Harold's hand.  The sight made\nher almost faint.  She rejoiced that she had been first down, and had\r\nopened the postbag with her own key.  She took the letter to her room and\nshut herself in before opening it.  Within were a few lines of writing\nand her own letter to Leonard in its envelope.  Her head beat so hard\nthat she could scarcely see; but gradually the writing seemed to grow out\nof the mist:\n\n'The enclosed should be in your hands.  It is possible that it may\ncomfort you to know that it is safe.  Whatever may come, God love and\nguard you.'\n\nFor a moment joy, hot and strong, blazed through her.  The last words\r\nwere ringing through her brain.  Then came the cold shock, and the gloom\nof fear.  Harold would never have written thus unless he was going away!\nIt was a farewell!\n\nFor a long time she stood, motionless, holding the letter in her hand.\nThen she said, half aloud:\n\n'Comfort!  Comfort!  There is no more comfort in the world for me!  Never,\nnever again!  Oh, Harold!  Harold!'\n\nShe sank on her knees beside her bed, and buried her face in her cold\nhands, sobbing in all that saddest and bitterest phase of sorrow which\ncan be to a woman's heart: the sorrow that is dry-eyed and without hope.","Presently the habit of caution which had governed her last days woke her\nto action.  She bathed her eyes, smoothed her hair, locked the letter and\nits enclosure in the little jewel-safe let into the wall, and came down\nto breakfast.\n\nThe sense of loss was so strong on her that she forgot herself.  Habit\ncarried her on without will or voluntary effort, and, so faithfully\nworked to her good that even the loving eyes of her aunt--and the eyes of\nlove are keen--had no suspicion that any new event had come into her\nlife.\r\nNot till she was alone in her room that night did Stephen dare to let her\nthoughts run freely.  In the darkness her mind began to work truly, so\ntruly that she began at the first step of logical process: to study\nfacts.  And to study them she must question till she found motive.\n\nWhy had Harold sent her the letter?  His own words said that it should be\nin her hands.  Then, again, he said it might comfort her to know the\nletter was safe.  How could it comfort her?  How did he get possession of\nthe letter?\n\nThere she began to understand; her quick intuition and her old knowledge\r\nof Harold's character and her new knowledge of Leonard's, helped her to\nreconstruct causes.  In his interview with her he had admitted that\nLeonard had told him much, all.  He would no doubt have refused to\nbelieve him, and Leonard would have shown him, as proof, her letter\nasking him to meet her.  He would have seen then, as she did now, how\nmuch the possession of that letter might mean to any one.\n\nGood God! to 'any one.'  Could it have been so to Harold himself . . .\nthat he thought to use it as an engine, to force her to meet his\r\nwishes--as Leonard had already tried to do!  The mistrust, founded on her\nfear, was not dead yet . . . No! no! no!  Her whole being resented such a\nmonstrous proposition!  Besides, there was proof.  Thank God! there was\nproof.  A blackmailer would have stayed close to her, and would have kept\nthe letter; Harold did neither.  Her recognition of the truth was shown\nin her act, when, stretching out her arms in the darkness, she whispered\npleadingly:\n\n'Forgive me, Harold!'\n\nAnd Harold, far away where the setting sun was lying red on the rim of","the western sea, could not hear her.  But perhaps God did.\n\nAs, then, Harold's motive was not of the basest, it must have been of the\nnoblest.  What would be a man's noblest motive under such circumstances?\nSurely self-sacrifice!\n\nAnd yet there could be no doubt as to Harold's earnestness when he had\ntold her that he loved her . . .\n\nHere Stephen covered her face in one moment of rapture.  But the gloom\nthat followed was darker than the night.  She did not pursue the thought.\nThat would come later when she should understand.\r\nAnd yet, so little do we poor mortals know the verities of things, so\nblind are we to things thrust before our eyes, that she understood more\nin that moment of ecstasy than in all the reasoning that preceded and\nfollowed it.  But the reasoning went on:\n\nIf he really loved, and told her so, wherein was the self-sacrifice?  She\nhad reproached him with coming to her with his suit hotfoot upon his\nknowledge of her shameful proffer of herself to another man; of her\nrefusal by him.  Could he have been so blind as not to have seen, as she\r\ndid, the shameful aspect of his impulsive act?  Surely, if he had\nthought, he must have seen! . . . And he must have thought; there had\nbeen time for it.  It was at dinner that he had seen Leonard; it was\nafter breakfast when he had seen her . . . And if he had seen then . . .\n\nIn an instant it all burst upon her; the whole splendid truth.  He had\nheld back the expression of his long love for her, waiting for the time\nwhen her maturity might enable her to understand truly and judge wisely;\nwaiting till her grief for the loss of her father had become a story of\r\nthe past; waiting for God knows what a man's mind sees of obstacles when\nhe loves.  But he had spoken it out when it was to her benefit.  What,\nthen, had been his idea of her benefit?  Was it that he wished to meet\nthe desire that she had manifested to have some man to--to love? . . .\nThe way she covered her face with her hands whilst she groaned aloud made\nher answer to her own query a perfect negative.\n\nWas it, then, to save her from the evil of marrying Leonard in case he\nshould repent of his harshness, and later on yield himself to her wooing?","The fierce movement of her whole body, which almost threw the clothes\nfrom her bed, as the shameful recollection rolled over her, marked the\nmeasure of her self-disdain.\n\nOne other alternative there was; but it seemed so remote, so far-fetched,\nso noble, so unlike what a woman would do, that she could only regard it\nin a shamefaced way.  She put the matter to herself questioningly, and\nwith a meekness which had its roots deeper than she knew.  And here out\nof the depths of her humility came a noble thought.  A noble thought,\r\nwhich was a noble truth.  Through the darkness of the night, through the\ninky gloom of her own soul came with that thought a ray of truth which,\nwhilst it showed her her own shrivelled unworthiness, made the man whom\nshe had dishonoured with insults worse than death stand out in noble\nrelief.  In that instant she guessed at, and realised, Harold's unselfish\nnobility of purpose, the supreme effort of his constant love.  Knowing\nthe humiliation she must have suffered at Leonard's hands, he had so\nplaced himself that even her rejection of him might be some solace to her\nwounded spirit, her pride.\r\nHere at last was truth!  She knew it in the very marrow of her bones.\n\nThis time she did not move.  She thought and thought of that noble\ngentleman who had used for her sake even that pent-up passion which, for\nher sake also, he had suppressed so long.\n\nIn that light, which restored in her eyes and justified so fully the man\nwhom she had always trusted, her own shame and wrongdoing, and the perils\nwhich surrounded her, were for the time forgotten.\n\nAnd its glory seemed to rest upon her whilst she slept.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX--CONFIDENCES\r\nMiss Rowly had received a bulky letter by the morning's post.  She had\nnot opened it, but had allowed it to rest beside her plate all breakfast-\ntime.  Then she had taken it away with her to her own sitting-room.\nStephen did not appear to take any notice of it.  She knew quite well\nthat it was from some one in London whom her aunt had asked to pay\nLeonard's bills.  She also knew that the old lady had some purpose in her\nreticence, so she waited.  She was learning to be patient in these days.\nMiss Rowly did say anything about it that day, or the next, or the next.","The third-morning, she received another letter which she had read in an\nenlightening manner.  She began its perusal with set brow frowning, then\nshe nodded her head and smiled.  She put the letter back in its envelope\nand placed it in the little bag always carried.  But she said nothing.\nStephen wondered, but waited.\n\nThat night, when Stephen's maid had left her, there came a gentle tap at\nher door, and an instant after the door opened.  The tap had been a\nwarning, not a request; it had in a measure prepared Stephen, who was not\r\nsurprised to see her Aunt in dressing-gown, though it was many a long day\nsince she had visited her niece's room at night.  She closed the door\nbehind her, saying:\n\n'There is something I want to talk to you about, dearest, and I thought\nit would be better to do so when there could not be any possible\ninterruption.  And besides,' here there was a little break in her voice,\n'I could hardly summon up my courage in the daylight.'  She stopped, and\nthe stopping told its own story.  In an instant Stephen's arm's were\nround her, all the protective instinct in her awake, at the distress of\r\nthe woman she loved.  The old lady took comfort from the warmth of the\nembrace, and held her tight whilst she went on:\n\n'It is about these bills, my dear.  Come and sit down and put a candle\nnear me.  I want you to read something.'\n\n'Go on, Auntie dear,' she said gravely.  The old lady, after a pause,\nspoke with a certain timidity:\n\n'They are all paid; at least all that can be.  Perhaps I had better read\nyou the letter I have had from my solicitors:\n\n'\"Dear Madam,--In accordance with your instructions we have paid all the\r\naccounts mentioned in Schedule A (enclosed).  We have placed for your\nconvenience three columns: (1) the original amount of each account, (2)\nthe amount of discount we were able to arrange, and (3) the amount paid.\nWe regret that we have been unable to carry out your wishes with regard\nto the items enumerated in Schedule B (enclosed).  We have, we assure\nyou, done all in our power to find the gentlemen whose names and\naddresses are therein given.  These were marked 'Debt of honour' in the\nlist you handed to us.  Not having been able to obtain any reply to our","letters, we sent one of our clerks first to the addresses in London, and\nafterwards to Oxford.  That clerk, who is well used to such inquiries,\ncould not find trace of any of the gentlemen, or indeed of their\nexistence.  We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that, either there\nmust be some error with regard to (a) names, (b) addresses, or (c) both;\nor that no such persons exist.  As it would be very unlikely that such\nerrors could occur in all the cases, we can only conclude that there have\nnot been any such persons.  If we may hazard an opinion: it is possible\r\nthat, these debts being what young men call 'debts of honour,' the\ndebtor, or possibly the creditors, may not have wished the names\nmentioned.  In such case fictitious names and addresses may have been\nsubstituted for the real ones.  If you should like any further inquiry\ninstituted we would suggest that you ascertain the exact names and\naddresses from the debtor.  Or should you prefer it we would see the\ngentleman on your behalf, on learning from you his name and address.  We\ncan keep, in the person of either one of the Firm or a Confidential Clerk\r\nas you might prefer, any appointment in such behalf you may care to make.\n\n'\"We have already sent to you the receipted account from each of the\ncreditors as you directed, viz. 'Received from Miss Laetitia Rowly in\nfull settlement to date of the account due by Mr. Leonard Everard the sum\nof,' etc. etc.  And also, as you further directed, a duplicate receipt of\nthe sum-total due in each case made out as 'Received in full settlement\nto date of account due by,' etc. etc.  The duplicate receipt was pinned\r\nat the back of each account so as to be easily detachable.\n\n'\"With regard to finance we have carried out your orders, etc.\"'  She\nhurried on the reading.  \"These sums, together with the amounts of nine\nhundred pounds sterling, and seven hundred pounds sterling lodged to the\naccount of Miss Stephen Norman in the Norcester branch of the Bank as\nrepayment of moneys advanced to you as by your written instructions, have\nexhausted the sum, etc.\"'  She folded up the letter with the schedules,\nlaying the bundle of accounts on the table.  Stephen paused; she felt it","necessary to collect herself before speaking.\n\n'Auntie dear, will you let me see that letter?  Oh, my dear, dear Auntie,\ndon't think I mistrust you that I ask it.  I do because I love you, and\nbecause I want to love you more if it is possible to do so.'  Miss Rowly\nhanded her the letter.  She rose from the arm of the chair and stood\nbeside the table as though to get better light from the candle than she\ncould get from where she had sat.\n\nShe read slowly and carefully to the end; then folded up the letter and\nhanded it to her aunt.  She came back to her seat on the edge of the\r\nchair, and putting her arms round her companion's neck looked her\nstraight in the eyes.  The elder woman grew embarrassed under the\nscrutiny; she coloured up and smiled in a deprecatory way as she said:\n\n'Don't look at me like that, darling; and don't shake your head so.  It\nis all right!  I told you I had my reasons, and you said you would trust\nme.  I have only done what I thought best!'\n\n'But, Auntie, you have paid away more than half your little fortune.  I\nknow all the figures.  Father and uncle told me everything.  Why did you\r\ndo it?  Why did you do it?'  The old woman held out her arms as she said:\n\n'Come here, dear one, and sit on my knee as you used to when you were a\nchild, and I will whisper you.'  Stephen sprang from her seat and almost\nthrew herself into the loving arms.  For a few seconds the two, clasped\ntight to each other's heart, rocked gently to and fro.  The elder kissed\nthe younger and was kissed impulsively in return.  Then she stroked the\nbeautiful bright hair with her wrinkled hand, and said admiringly:\n\n'What lovely hair you have, my dear one!'  Stephen held her closer and\r\nwaited.\n\n'Well, my dear, I did it because I love you!'\n\n'I know that, Auntie; you have never done anything else my life!'\n\n'That is true, dear one.  But it is right that I should do this.  Now you\nmust listen to me, and not speak till I have done.  Keep your thoughts on\nmy words, so that you may follow my thoughts.  You can do your own\nthinking about them afterwards.  And your own talking too; I shall listen\nas long as you like!'\n\n'Go on, I'll be good!'\n\n'My dear, it is not right that you should appear to have paid the debts","of a young man who is no relation to you and who will, I know well, never\nbe any closer to you than he is now.'  She hurried on, as though fearing\nan interruption, but Stephen felt that her clasp tightened.  'We never\ncan tell what will happen as life goes on.  And, as the world is full of\nscandal, one cannot be too careful not to give the scandalmongers\nanything to exercise their wicked spite upon.  I don't trust that young\nman! he is a bad one all round, or I am very much mistaken.  And, my\ndear, come close to me!  I cannot but see that you and he have some\r\nsecret which he is using to distress you!'  She paused, and her clasp\ngrew closer still as Stephen's head sank on her breast.  'I know you have\ndone something or said something foolish of which he has a knowledge.  And\nI know my dear one, that whatever it was, and no matter how foolish it\nmay have been, it was not a wrong thing.  God knows, we are all apt to do\nwrong things as well as foolish ones; the best of us.  But such is not\nfor you!  Your race, your father and mother, your upbringing, yourself\nand the truth and purity which are yours would save you from anything\r\nwhich was in itself wrong.  That I know, my dear, as well as I know\nmyself!  Ah! better, far better! for the gods did not think it well to\ndower me as they have dowered you.  The God of all the gods has given you\nthe ten talents to guard; and He knows, as I do, that you will be\nfaithful to your trust.'\n\nThere was a solemn ring in her voce as the words were spoken which went\nthrough the young girl's heart.  Love and confidence demanded in return\nthat she should have at least the relief of certain acquiescence; there\r\nis a possible note of pain in the tensity of every string!  Stephen\nlifted her head proudly and honestly, though her cheeks were scarlet,\nsaying with a consciousness of integrity which spoke directly soul to\nsoul:\n\n'You are right, dear!  I have done something very foolish; very, very\nfoolish!  But it was nothing which any one could call wrong.  Do not ask\nme what it was.  I need only tell you this: that it was an outrage on\nconvention.  It was so foolish, and based on such foolish misconception;\nit sprang from such over-weening, arrogant self-opinion that it deserves","the bitter punishment which will come; which is coming; which is with me\nnow!  It was the cause of something whose blackness I can't yet realise;\nbut of which I will tell you when I can speak of it.  But it was not\nwrong in itself, or in the eyes of God or man!'  The old woman said not a\nword.  No word was needed, for had she not already expressed her belief?\nBut Stephen felt her relief in the glad pressure of her finger-tips.  In\na voice less strained and tense Miss Rowly went on:\n\n'What need have I for money, dear?  Here I have all that any woman,\r\nespecially at my age, can need.  There is no room even for charity; you\nare so good to all your people that my help is hardly required.  And, my\ndear one, I know--I know,' she emphasised the word as she stroked the\nbeautiful hair, 'that when I am gone my own poor, the few that I have\nlooked after all my life, will, not suffer when my darling thinks of me!'\nStephen fairly climbed upon her as she said, looking in the brave old\neyes:\n\n'So help me God, my darling, they shall never want!'\n\nSilence for a time; and then Miss Rowly's voice again:\r\n'Though it would not do for the world to know that a young maiden lady\nhad paid the debts of a vicious young man, it makes no matter if they be\npaid by an old woman, be the same maid, wife, or widow!  And really, my\ndear, I do not see how any money I might have could be better spent than\nin keeping harm away from you.'\n\n'There need not be any harm at all, Auntie.'\n\n'Perhaps not, dear!  I hope not with all my heart.  But I fear that young\nman.  Just fancy him threatening you, and in your own house; in my very\npresence!  Oh! yes, my dear.  He meant to threaten, anyhow!  Though I\r\ncould not exactly understand what he was driving at, I could see that he\nwas driving at something.  And after all that you were doing for him, and\nhad done for him!  I mean, of course, after all that I had done for him,\nand was doing for him.  It is mean enough, surely, for a man to beg, and\nfrom a woman; but to threaten afterwards.  Ach!  But I think, my dear, it\nis checkmate to him this time.  All along the line the only proof that is\nof there being any friendliness towards him from this house points to me.","And moreover, my dear, I have a little plan in my head that will tend to\nshow him up even better, in case he may ever try to annoy us.  Look at me\nwhen next he is here.  I mean to do a little play-acting which will\nastonish him, I can tell you, if it doesn't frighten him out of the house\naltogether.  But we won't talk of that yet.  You will understand when you\nsee it!'  Her eyes twinkled and her mouth shut with a loud snap as she\nspoke.\n\nAfter a few minutes of repose, which was like a glimpse of heaven to\nStephen's aching heart, she spoke again:\r\n'There was something else that troubled you more than even this.  You\nsaid you would tell me when you were able to speak of it . . . Why not\nspeak now?  Oh! my dear, our hearts are close together to-night; and in\nall your life, you will never have any one who will listen with greater\nsympathy than I will, or deal more tenderly with your fault, whatever it\nmay have been.  Tell me, dear!  Dear!' she whispered after a pause,\nduring which she realised the depth of the girl's emotion by her\nconvulsive struggling to keep herself in check.\r\nAll at once the tortured girl seemed to yield herself, and slipped\ninertly from her grasp till kneeling down she laid her head in the\nmotherly lap and sobbed.  Miss Rowly kept stroking her hair in silence.\nPresently the girl looked up, and with a pang the aunt saw that her eyes\nwere dry.  In her pain she said:\n\n'You sob like that, my child, and yet you are not crying; what is it, oh!\nmy dear one?  What is it that hurts you so that you cannot cry?'\n\nAnd then the bitter sobbing broke out again, but still alas! without\ntears.  Crouching low, and still enclosing her aunt's waist with her\r\noutstretched arms and hiding her head in her breast; she said:\n\n'Oh! Auntie, I have sent Harold away!'\n\n'What, my dear?  What?' said the old lady astonished.  'Why, I thought\nthere was no one in the world that you trusted so much as Harold!'\n\n'It is true.  There was--there is no one except you whom I trust so much.\nBut I mistook something he said.  I was in a blind fury at the time, and\nI said things that I thought my father's daughter never could have said.\nAnd she never thought them, even then!  Oh, Auntie, I drove him away with","all the horrible things I could say that would wound him.  And all\nbecause he acted in a way that I see now was the most noble and knightly\nin which any man could act.  He that my dear father had loved, and\nhonoured, and trusted as another son.  He that was a real son to him, and\nnot a mock sop like me.  I sent him away with such fierce and bitter pain\nthat his poor face was ashen grey, and there was woe in his eyes that\nshall make woe in mine whenever I shall see them in my mind, waking or\nsleeping.  He, the truest friend . . . the most faithful, the most\r\ntender, the most strong, the most unselfish!  Oh! Auntie, Auntie, he just\nturned and bowed and went away.  And he couldn't do anything else with\nthe way I spoke to him; and now I shall never see him again!'\n\nThe young girl's eyes ware still dry, but the old woman's were wet.  For\na few minutes she kept softly stroking the bowed heat till the sobbing\ngrew less and less, and then died away; and the girl lay still, collapsed\nin the abandonment of dry-eyed grief.\n\nThen she rose, and taking off her dressing-gown, said tenderly:\r\n'Let me stay with you to-night, dear one?  Go to sleep in my arms, as you\ndid long ago when there was any grief that you could not bear.'\n\nSo Stephen lay in those loving arms till her own young breast ceased\nheaving, and she breathed softly.  Till dawn she slept on the bosom of\nher who loved her so well.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI--THE DUTY OF COURTESY\n\n\nLeonard was getting tired of waiting when he received his summons to\nNormanstand.  But despite his impatience he was ill pleased with the\nsummons, which came in the shape of a polite note from Miss Rowly asking\r\nhim to come that afternoon at tea-time.  He had expected to hear from\nStephen.\n\n'Damn that old woman!  You'd think she was working the whole show!'\nHowever, he turned up at a little before five o'clock, spruce and dapper\nand well dressed and groomed as usual.  He was shown, as before, into the\nblue drawing-room.  Miss Rowly, who sat there, rose as he entered, and\ncoming across the room, greeted him, as he thought, effusively.  He\nactually winced when she called him 'my dear boy' before the butler.\n\nShe ordered tea to be served at once, and when it had been brought she","said to the butler:\n\n'Tell Mannerly to bring me a large thick envelope which is on the table\nin my room.  It is marked L.E. on the outside.'  Presently an elderly\nmaid handed her the envelope and withdrew.  When tea was over she opened\nthe envelope, and taking from it a number of folios, looked over them\ncarefully; holding them in her lap, she said quietly:\n\n'You will find writing materials on the table.  I am all ready now to\nhand you over the receipts.'  His eyes glistened.  This was good news at\r\nall events; the debts were paid.  In a rapid flash of thought he came to\nthe conclusion that if the debts were actually paid he need not be civil\nto the old lady.  He felt that he could have been rude to her if he had\nactual possession of the receipts.  As it was, however, he could not yet\nafford to have any unpleasantness.  There was still to come that lowering\ninterview with his father; and he could not look towards it\nsatisfactorily until he had the assurance of the actual documents that he\nwas safe.  Miss Rowly was, in her own way, reading his mind in his face.\r\nHer lorgnon seemed to follow his every expression like a searchlight.  He\nremembered his former interview with her, and how he had been bested in\nit; so he made up his mind to acquiesce in time.  He went over to the\ntable and sat down.  Taking a pen he turned to Miss Rowly and said:\n\n'What shall I write?'  She answered calmly:\n\n'Date it, and then say, \"Received from Miss Laetitia Rowly the receipts\nfor the following amounts from the various firms hereunder enumerated.\"'\nShe then proceeded to read them, he writing and repeating as he wrote.\nThen she added:\r\n'\"The same being the total amount of my debts which she has kindly paid\nfor me.\"'  He paused here; she asked.\n\n'Why don't you go on?'\n\n'I thought it was Stephen--Miss Norman,' he corrected, catching sight of\nher lorgnon, 'who was paying them.'\n\n'Good Lord, man,' she answered, 'what does it matter who has paid them,\nso long as they are paid?'\n\n'But I didn't ask you to pay them,' he went on obstinately.  There was a\npause, and then the old lady, with a distinctly sarcastic smile, said:\n\n'It seems to me, young man, that you are rather particular as to how","things are done for you.  If you had begun to be just a little bit as\nparticular in making the debts as you are in the way of having them paid,\nthere would be a little less trouble and expense all round.  However, the\ndebts have been paid, and we can't unpay them.  But of course you can\nrepay me the money if you like.  It amounts in all to four thousand three\nhundred and seventeen pounds, twelve shillings and sixpence, and I have\npaid every penny of it out of my own pocket.  If you can't pay it\nyourself, perhaps your father would like to do so.'\r\nThe last shot told; he went on writing: '\"Kindly paid for me,\"' she\ncontinued in the same even voice:\n\n'\"In remembrance of my mother, of whom she was an acquaintance.\"  Now\nsign it!'  He did so and handed it to her.  She read it over carefully,\nfolded it, and put it in her pocket.  She then stood.  He rose also; and\nas he moved to the door--he had not offered to shake hands with her--he\nsaid:\n\n'I should like to see, Miss Norman.'\n\n'I am afraid you will have to wait.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'She is over at Heply Regis.  She went there for Lady Heply's ball, and\r\nwill remain for a few days.  Good afternoon!'  The tone in which the last\ntwo words were spoken seemed in his ears like the crow of the victor\nafter a cock-fight.\n\nAs he was going out of the room a thought struck her.  She felt he\ndeserved some punishment for his personal rudeness to her.  After all,\nshe had paid half her fortune for him, though not on his account; and not\nonly had he given no thanks, but had not even offered the usual courtesy\nof saying good-bye.  She had intended to have been silent on the subject,\nand to have allowed him to discover it later.  Now she said, as if it was\r\nan after-thought:\n\n'By the way, I did not pay those items you put down as \"debts of honour\";\nyou remember you gave the actual names and addresses.'\n\n'Why not?' the question came from him involuntarily.  The persecuting\nlorgnon rose again:\n\n'Because they were all bogus!  Addresses, names, debts, honour!  Good\nafternoon!'\n\nHe went out flaming; free from debt, money debts; all but one.  And some\nother debts--not financial--whose magnitude was exemplified in the\ngrinding of his teeth.\n\nAfter breakfast next morning he said to his father:","'By the way, you said you wished to speak to me, sir.'  There was\nsomething in the tone of his voice which called up antagonism.\n\n'Then you have paid your debts?'\n\n'All!'\n\n'Good!  Now there is something which it is necessary I should call your\nattention to.  Do you remember the day on which I handed you that\npleasing epistle from Messrs. Cavendish and Cecil?'\n\n'Certainly, sir.'\n\n'Didn't you send a telegram to them?'\n\n'I did.'\n\n'You wrote it yourself?'\n\n'Certainly.'\n\n'I had a courteous letter from the money-lenders, thanking me for my\r\nexertions in securing the settlement of their claim, and saying that in\naccordance with the request in my telegram they had held over proceedings\nuntil the day named.  I did not quite remember having sent any telegram\nto them, or any letter either.  So, being at a loss, I went to our\nexcellent postmaster and requested that he would verify the sending of a\ntelegram to London from me.  He courteously looked up the file; which was\nready for transference to the G.P.O., and showed me the form.  It was in\nyour handwriting.'  He paused so long that Leonard presently said:\r\n'Well!'\n\n'It was signed Jasper Everard.  Jasper Everard! my name; and yet it was\nsent by my son, who was christened, if I remember rightly, Leonard!'  Then\nhe went on, only in a cold acrid manner which made his son feel as though\na February wind was blowing on his back:\n\n'I think there need not have been much trouble in learning to avoid\nconfusing our names.  They are really dissimilar.  Have you any\nexplanation to offer of the--the error, let us call it?'  A bright\nthought struck Leonard.\n\n'Why, sir,' he said, 'I put it in your name as they had written to you.  I\r\nthought it only courteous.'  The elder man winced; he had not expected\nthe excuse.  We went on speaking in the same calm way, but his tone was\nmore acrid than before:\n\n'Good! of course!  It was only courteous of you!  Quite so!  But I think\nit will be well in the future to let me look after my own courtesy; as\nregards my signature at any rate.  You see, my dear boy, a signature is\nqueer sort of thing, and judges and juries are apt to take a poor view of\ncourtesy as over against the conventions regarding a man, writing his own","name.  What I want to tell you is this, that on seeing that signature I\nmade a new will.  You see, my estate is not entailed, and therefore I\nthink it only right to see that in such a final matter justice is done\nall round.  I therefore made a certain provision of which I am sure you\nwill approve.  Indeed, since I am assured of the payment of your debts, I\nfeel justified in my action.  I may say, inter alia, that I congratulate\nyou on either the extent of your resources or the excellence of your\r\nfriendships, or both.  I confess that the amounts brought to my notice\nwere rather large; more especially in proportion to the value of the\nestate which you are some day to inherit.  For you are of course to\ninherit some day, my dear boy.  You are my only son, and it would be\nhardly--hardly courteous of me not to leave it to you.  But I have put a\nclause in my will to the effect that the trustee's are to pay all debts\nof your accruing which can be proved against you, before handing over to\nyou either the estate itself or the remainder after its sale and the\r\nsettlement of all claims.  That's all.  Now run away, my boy; I have some\nimportant work to do.'\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe day after her return from Heply Regis, Stephen was walking in the\nwood when she thought she heard a slight rustling of leaves some way\nbehind her.  She looked round, expecting to see some one; but the leafy\npath was quite clear.  Her suspicion was confirmed; some one was secretly\nfollowing her.  A short process of exclusions pointed to the personality\nof the some one.  Tramps and poachers were unknown in Normanstand, and\r\nthere was no one else whom she could think of who had any motive in\nfollowing her in such a way; it must be Leonard Everard.  She turned and\nwalked rapidly in the opposite direction.  As this would bring her to the\nhouse Leonard had to declare his presence at once or else lose the\nopportunity of a private interview which he sought.  When she saw him she\nsaid at once and without any salutation:\n\n'What are you doing there; why are you following me?'\n\n'I wanted to see you alone.  I could not get near you on account of that\ninfernal old woman.'  Stephen's face grew hard.","'On account of whom?' she asked with dangerous politeness.\n\n'Miss Rowly; your aunt.'\n\n'Don't you think, Mr. Everard,' she said icily, 'that it is at least an\nunpardonable rudeness to speak that way, and to me, of the woman I love\nbest in all the world?'\n\n'Sorry!' he said in the offhand way of younger days, 'I apologise.  Fact\nis, I was angry that she wouldn't let me see you.'\n\n'Not let you see me!' she said as if amazed.  'What do mean?'\n\n'Why, I haven't been able to see you alone ever since I went to meet you\non Caester Hill.'\r\n'But why should you see me alone?' she asked as if still in amazement.\n'Surely you can say anything you have to say before my aunt.'  With an\nunwisdom for which an instant later he blamed himself he blurted out:\n\n'Why, old girl, you yourself did not think her presence necessary when\nyou asked me to meet you on the hill.'\n\n'When was that?'  She saw that he was angry and wanted to test him; to\ntry how far he would venture.  He was getting dangerous; she must know\nthe measure of what she had to fear.\n\nHe fell into the trap at once.  His debts being paid, fear was removed,\r\nand all the hectoring side of the man was aroused.  His antagonist was a\nwoman; and he had already had in his life so many unpleasant scenes with\nwomen that this was no new experience.  This woman had, by her own\nindiscretion, put a whip into his hand; and, if necessary to secure his\nown way, by God! he meant to use it!  These last days had made her a more\ndesirable possession in his eyes.  The vastness of her estate had taken\nhold on him, and his father's remorseless intention with regard to his\nwill would either keep him with very limited funds, or leave him\r\neventually a pauper if he forestalled his inheritance.  The desire of her\nwealth had grown daily, and it was now the main force in bringing him\nhere to-day.  And to this was now added the personal desire which her\npresence evoked.  Stephen, at all times beautiful, had never looked more\nlovely.  In the days since she had met him on the hilltop, a time that to\nher seemed so long ago, she had grown to be a woman, and there is some\nsubtle inconceivable charm in completed womanhood.  The reaction from her","terrible fear and depression had come, and her strong brilliant youth was\nmanifesting itself.  Her step was springy and her eyes were bright; and\nthe glow of fine health, accentuated by the militant humour of the\npresent moment, seemed to light up her beautiful skin.  In herself she\nwas desirable, very desirable; Leonard felt his pulses quicken and his\nblood leap as he looked at her.  Even his prejudice against her red hair\nhad changed to something like hungry admiration.  Leonard felt for the\nfirst moment since he had known her that she was a woman; and that, with\r\nrelation to her, he was a man.\n\nAnd at the moment all the man in him asserted itself.  It was with half\nlove, as he saw it, and half self-assertion that he answered her\nquestion:\n\n'The day you asked me to marry you!  Oh! what a fool I was not to leap at\nsuch a chance!  I should have taken you in my arms then and kissed you\ntill I showed you how much I loved you.  But that will all come yet; the\nkissing is still to come!  Oh!  Stephen, don't you see that I love you?\nWon't you tell me that you love me still?  Darling!'  He almost sprang at\r\nher, his arms extended to clasp her.\n\n'Stop!'  Her voice rang like a trumpet.  She did not mean to submit to\nphysical violence, and in the present state of her feeling, an embrace\nfrom him would be a desecration.  He was now odious to her; she\npositively loathed him.\n\nBefore her uplifted hand and those flashing eyes, he stopped as one\nstricken into stone.  In that instant she knew she was safe; and with a\nwoman's quickness of apprehension and resolve, made up her mind what\ncourse to pursue.  In a calm voice she said quietly:\r\n'Mr. Everard, you have followed me in secret, and without my permission.\nI cannot talk here with you, alone.  I absolutely refuse to do so; now or\nat any other time.  If you have anything especial to say to me you will\nfind me at home at noon to-morrow.  Remember, I do not ask you to come.  I\nsimply yield to the pressure of your importunity.  And remember also that\nI do not authorise you in any way to resume this conversation.  In fact,\nI forbid it.  If you come to my house you must control yourself to my\nwish!'\n\nThen with a stately bow, whose imperious distance inflamed him more than","ever, and without once looking back she took her way home, all agitated\ninwardly and with fast beating heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII--FIXING THE BOUNDS\n\n\nLeonard came towards Normanstand next forenoon in considerable mental\ndisturbance.  In the first place he was seriously in love with Stephen,\nand love is in itself a disturbing influence.\n\nLeonard's love was all of the flesh; and as such had power at present to\ndisturb him, as it would later have power to torture him.  Again, he was\ndisturbed by the fear of losing Stephen, or rather of not being able to\r\ngain her.  At first, ever since she had left him on the path from the\nhilltop till his interview the next day, he had looked on her possession\nas an 'option,' to the acceptance of which circumstances seemed to be\ncompelling him.  But ever since, that asset seemed to have been\ndwindling; and now he was almost beginning to despair.  He was altogether\ncold at heart, and yet highly strung with apprehension, as he was shown\ninto the blue drawing-room.\n\nStephen came in alone, closing the door behind her.  She shook hands with\r\nhim, and sat down by a writing-table near the window, pointing to him to\nsit on an ottoman a little distance away.  The moment he sat down he\nrealised that he was at a disadvantage; he was not close to her, and he\ncould not get closer without manifesting his intention of so doing.  He\nwanted to be closer, both for the purpose of his suit and for his own\npleasure; the proximity of Stephen began to multiply his love for her.  He\nthought that to-day she looked better than ever, of a warm radiant beauty\nwhich touched his senses with unattainable desire.  She could not but\r\nnotice the passion in his eyes, and instinctively her eyes wandered to a\nsilver gong placed on the table well within reach.  The more he glowed,\nthe more icily calm she sat, till the silence between them began to grow\noppressive.  She waited, determined that he should be the first to speak.\nRecognising the helplessness of silence, he began huskily:\n\n'I came here to-day in the hope that you would listen to me.'  Her\nanswer, given with a conventional smile, was not helpful:\n\n'I am listening.'\n\n'I cannot tell you how sorry I am that I did not accept your offer.  If I","had know when I was coming that day that you loved me . . . '  She\ninterrupted him, calm of voice, and with uplifted hand:\n\n'I never said so, did I?  Surely I could not have said such a thing!  I\ncertainly don't remember it?'  Leonard was puzzled.\n\n'You certainly made me think so.  You asked me to marry you, didn't you?'\nHer answer came calmly, though in a low voice:\n\n'I did.'\n\n'Then if you didn't love me, why did you ask me to marry you?'  It was\nhis nature to be more or less satisfied when he had put any one opposed\r\nto him proportionally in the wrong; and now his exultation at having put\na poser manifested itself in his tone.  This, however, braced up Stephen\nto cope with a difficult and painful situation.  It was with a calm,\nseemingly genial frankness, that she answered, smilingly:\n\n'Do you know, that is what has been puzzling me from that moment to\nthis!'  Her words appeared to almost stupefy Leonard.  This view of the\nmatter had not occurred to him, and now the puzzle of it made him angry.\n\n'Do you mean to say,' he asked hotly, 'that you asked a man to marry you\nwhen you didn't even love him?'\r\n'That is exactly what I do mean!  Why I did it is, I assure you, as much\na puzzle to me as it is to you.  I have come to the conclusion that it\nmust have been from my vanity.  I suppose I wanted to dominate somebody;\nand you were the weakest within range!'\n\n'Thank you!'  He was genuinely angry by this time, and, but for a\nwholesome fear of the consequences, would have used strong language.\n\n'I don't see that I was the weakest about.'  Somehow this set her on her\nguard.  She wanted to know more, so she asked:\n\n'Who else?'\r\n'Harold An Wolf!  You had him on a string already!'  The name came like a\nsword through her heart, but the bitter comment braced her to further\ncaution.  Her voice seemed to her to sound as though far away:\n\n'Indeed!  And may I ask you how you came to know that?'  Her voice seemed\nso cold and sneering to him that he lost his temper still further.\n\n'Simply because he told me so himself.'  It pleased him to do in ill turn\nto Harold.  He did not forget that savage clutch at his throat; and he\nnever would.  Stephen's senses were all alert.  She saw an opportunity of","learning something, and went on with the same cold voice:\n\n'And I suppose it was that pleasing confidence which was the cause of\nyour refusal of my offer of marriage; of which circumstance you have so\nthoughtfully and so courteously reminded me.'  This, somehow, seemed of\ngood import to Leonard.  If he could show her that his intention to marry\nher was antecedent to Harold's confidence, she might still go back to her\nold affection for him.  He could not believe that it did not still exist;\nhis experience of other women showed him that their love outlived their\r\nanger, whether the same had been hot or cold.\n\n'It had nothing in the world to do with it.  He never said a word about\nit till he threatened to kill me--the great brute!'  This was learning\nsomething indeed!  She went on in the same voice:\n\n'And may I ask you what was the cause of such sanguinary intention?'\n\n'Because he knew that I was going to marry you!'  As he spoke he felt\nthat he had betrayed himself; he went on hastily, hoping that it might\nescape notice:\n\n'Because he knew that I loved you.  Oh! Stephen, don't you know it now!\r\nCan't you see that I love you; and that I want you for my wife!'\n\n'But did he threaten to kill you out of mere jealousy?  Do you still go\nin fear of your life?  Will it be necessary to arrest him?'  Leonard was\nchagrined at her ignoring of his love-suit, and in his self-engrossment\nanswered sulkily:\n\n'I'm not afraid of him!  And, besides, I believe he has bolted.  I called\nat his house yesterday, and his servant said they hadn't heard a word\nfrom him.'  Stephen's heart sank lower and lower.  This was what she had\ndreaded.  She said in as steady a voice as she could muster:\r\n'Bolted!  Has he gone altogether?'\n\n'Oh, he'll come back all right, in time.  He's not going to give up the\njolly good living he has here!'\n\n'But why has he bolted?  When he threatened to kill you did he give any\nreason?'  There was too much talk about Harold.  It made him angry; so he\nanswered in an offhand way:\n\n'Oh, I don't know.  And, moreover, I don't care!'\n\n'And now,' said Stephen, having ascertained what she wanted to know,\n'what is it that you want to speak to me about?'\n\nHer words fell on Leonard like a cold douche.  Here had he been talking","about his love for her, and yet she ignored the whole thing, and asked\nhim what he wanted to talk about.\n\n'What a queer girl you are.  You don't seem to attend to what a fellow is\nsaying.  Here have I been telling you that I love you, and asking you to\nmarry me; and yet you don't seem to have even heard me!'  She answered at\nonce, quite sweetly, and with a smile of superiority which maddened him:\n\n'But that subject is barred!'\n\n'How do you mean?  Barred!'\n\n'Yes.  I told you yesterday!'\n\n'But, Stephen,' he cried out quickly, all the alarm in him and all the\r\nearnestness of which he was capable uniting to his strengthening, 'can't\nyou understand that I love you, with all my heart?  You are so beautiful;\nso beautiful!'  He felt now in reality what he was saying.\n\nThe torrent of his words left no opening for her objection; it swept all\nmerely verbal obstacles before it.  She listened, content in a measure.\nSo long as he sat at the distance which she had arranged before his\ncoming she did not fear any personal violence.  Moreover, it was a\nsatisfaction to her now to hear him, who had refused her, pleading in\r\nvain.  The more sincere his eloquence, the larger her satisfaction; she\nhad no pity for him now.\n\n'I know I was a fool, Stephen!  I had my chance that day on the hilltop;\nand if I had felt then as I feel now, as I have felt every moment since,\nI would not have been so cold.  I would have taken you in my arms and\nheld you close and kissed you, again, and again, and again.  Oh, darling!\nI love you!  I love you!  I love you!'  He held out his arms imploringly.\n'Won't you love me?  Won't--'\n\nHe stopped, paralysed with angry amazement.  She was laughing.\r\nHe grew purple in the face; his hands were still outstretched.  The few\nseconds seemed like hours.\n\n'Forgive me!' she said in a polite tone, suddenly growing grave.  'But\nreally you looked so funny, sitting there so quietly, and speaking in\nsuch a way, that I couldn't help it.  You really must forgive me!  But\nremember, I told you the subject was barred; and as, knowing that, you\nwent on, you really have no one but yourself to blame!'  Leonard was\nfurious, but managed to say as he dropped his arms:","'But I love you!'\n\n'That may be, now,' she went on icily.  'But it is too late.  I do not\nlove you; and I have never loved you!  Of course, had you accepted my\noffer of marriage you should never have known that.  No matter how great\nhad been my shame and humiliation when I had come to a sense of what I\nhad done, I should have honourably kept my part of the tacit compact\nentered into when I made that terrible mistake.  I cannot tell you how\nrejoiced and thankful I am that you took my mistake in such a way.  Of\ncourse, I do not give you any credit for it; you thought only of\r\nyourself, and did that which you liked best!'\n\n'That is a nice sort of thing to tell a man!' he interrupted with cynical\nfrankness.\n\n'Oh, I do not want to hurt you unnecessarily; but I wish there to be no\npossible misconception in the matter.  Now that I have discovered my\nerror I am not likely to fall into it again; and that you may not have\nany error at all, I tell you now again, that I have not loved you, do not\nlove you, and never will and never can love you.'  Here an idea struck\nLeonard and he blurted out:\r\n'But do you not think that something is due to me?'\n\n'How do you mean?'  Her brows were puckered with real wonder this time.\n\n'For false hopes raised in my mind.  If I did not love you before, the\nvery act of proposing to me has made me love you; and now I love you so\nwell that I cannot live without you!'  In his genuine agitation he was\nstarting up, when the sight of her hand laid upon the gong arrested him.\nShe laughed as she said:\n\n'I thought that the privilege of changing one's mind was a female\nprerogative!  Besides, I have done already something to make reparation\r\nto you for the wrong of . . . of--I may put it fairly, as the suggestion\nis your own--of not having treated you as a woman!'\n\n'Damn!'\n\n'As you observe so gracefully, it is annoying to have one's own silly\nwords come back at one, boomerang fashion.  I made up my mind to do\nsomething for you; to pay off your debts.'  This so exasperated him that\nhe said out brutally:\n\n'No thanks to you for that!  As I had to put up with the patronage and\nthe lecturings, and the eyeglass of that infernal old woman, I don't\nintend . . . '","Stephen stood up, her hand upon the gong:\n\n'Mr. Everard, if you do not remember that you are in my drawing-room, and\nspeaking of my dear and respected aunt, I shall not detain you longer!'\n\nHe sat down at once, saying surlily:\n\n'I beg your pardon.  I forgot.  You make me so wild that--that . . . '  He\nchewed the ends of his moustache angrily.  She resumed her seat, taking\nher hand from the gong.  Without further pause she continued:\n\n'Quite right!  It has been Miss Rowly who paid your debts.  At first I\r\nhad promised myself the pleasure; but from something in your speech and\nmanner she thought it better that such an act should not be done by a\nwoman in my position to a man in yours.  It might, if made public, have\ncreated quite a wrong impression in the minds of many of our friends.'\n\nThere was something like a snort from Leonard.  She ignored it:\n\n'So she paid the money herself out of her own fortune.  And, indeed, I\nmust say that you do not seem to have treated her with much gratitude.'\n\n'What did I say or do that put you off doing the thing yourself?'\r\n'I shall answer it frankly: It was because you manifested, several times,\nin a manner there was no mistaking, both by words and deeds, an intention\nof levying blackmail on me by using your knowledge of my ridiculous,\nunmaidenly act.  No one can despise, or deplore, or condemn that act more\nthan I do; so that rather than yield a single point to you, I am, if\nnecessary, ready to face the odium which the public knowledge of it might\nproduce.  What I had intended to do for you in the way of compensation\nfor false hopes raised to you by that act has now been done.  That it was\r\ndone by my aunt on my behalf, and not by me, matters to you no more than\nit did to your creditors, who, when they received the money, made no\ncomplaint of injury to their feelings on that account.\n\n'Now, when you think the whole matter over in quietness, you will,\nknowing that I am ready at any time to face if necessary the unpleasant\npublicity, be able to estimate what damage you would do to yourself by\nany expose.  It seems to me that you would come out of it pretty badly\nall round.  That, however, is not my affair; it entirely rests with","yourself.  I think I know how women would regard it.  I dare say you best\nknow how men would look at it; and at you!'\n\nLeonard knew already how the only man who knew of it had taken it, and\nthe knowledge did not reassure him!\n\n'You jade!  You infernal, devilish, cruel, smooth-tongued jade!'  He\nstood as bespoke.  She stood too, and stood watching him with her hand on\nthe gong.  After a pause of a couple of seconds she said gravely:\n\n'One other thing I should wish to say, and I mean it.  Understand me\r\nclearly, that I mean it!  You must not come again into my grounds without\nmy special permission.  I shall not allow my liberty to be taken away, or\nrestricted, by you.  If there be need at any time to come to the house,\ncome in ceremonious fashion, by the avenues which are used by others.  You\ncan always speak to me in public, or socially, in the most friendly\nmanner; as I shall hope to be able to speak to you.  But you must never\ntransgress the ordinary rules of decorum.  If you do, I shall have to\ntake, for my own protection, another course.  I know you now!  I am\r\nwilling to blot out the past; but it must be the whole past that is wiped\nout!'\n\nShe stood facing him; and as he looked at her clear-cut aquiline face,\nher steady eyes, her resolute mouth, her carriage, masterly in its self-\npossessed poise, he saw that there was no further hope for him.  There\nwas no love and no fear.\n\n'You devil!' he hissed.\n\nShe struck the gong; her aunt entered the room.\n\n'Oh, is that you, Auntie?  Mr. Everard has finished his business with\nme!'  Then to the servant, who had entered after Miss Rowly:\n\n'Mr. Everard would like his carriage.  By the way,' she added, turning to\r\nhim in a friendly way as an afterthought, 'will you not stay, Mr.\nEverard, and take lunch with us?  My aunt has been rather moping lately;\nI am sure your presence would cheer her up.'\n\n'Yes, do stay, Mr. Everard!' added Miss Rowly placidly.  'It would make a\npleasant hour for us all.'\n\nLeonard, with a great effort, said with conventional politeness:\n\n'Thanks, awfully!  But I promised my father to be home for lunch!' and he\nwithdrew to the door which the servant held open.\n\nHe went out filled with anger and despair, and, sad for him, with a","fierce, overmastering desire--love he called it--for the clever, proud,\nimperious beauty who had so outmatched and crushed him.\n\nThat beautiful red head, which he had at first so despised, was\nhenceforth to blaze in his dreams.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII--THE MAN\n\n\nOn the _Scoriac_ Harold An Wolf, now John Robinson, kept aloof from every\none.  He did not make any acquaintances, did not try to.  Some of those\nat table with him, being ladies and gentlemen, now and again made a\npolite remark; to which he answered with equal politeness.  Being what he\r\nwas he could not willingly offend any one; and there was nothing in his\nmanner to repel any kindly overture to acquaintance.  But this was the\nfull length his acquaintanceship went; so he gradually felt himself\npractically alone.  This was just what he wished; he sat all day silent\nand alone, or else walked up and down the great deck that ran from stem\nto stern, still always alone.  As there were no second-class or steerage\npassengers on the _Scoriac_, there were no deck restraints, and so there\nwas ample room for individual solitude.  The travellers, however, were a\r\nsociable lot, and a general feeling of friendliness was abroad.  The\nfirst four days of the journey were ideally fine, and life was a joy.  The\ngreat ship, with bilge keels, was as steady as a rock.\n\nAmong the other passengers was an American family consisting of Andrew\nStonehouse, the great ironmaster and contractor, with his wife and little\ndaughter.\n\nStonehouse was a remarkable man in his way, a typical product of the\nAnglo-Saxon under American conditions.  He had started in young manhood\r\nwith nothing but a good education, due in chief to his own industry and\nhis having taken advantage to the full of such opportunities as life had\nafforded to him.  By unremitting work he had at thirty achieved a great\nfortune, which had, however; been up to then entirely invested and\ninvolved in his businesses.  With, however, the colossal plant at his\ndisposal, and by aid of the fine character he had won for honesty and\ngood work, he was able within the next ten years to pile up a fortune\nvast even in a nation where multi-millionaires are scattered freely.  Then","he had married, wisely and happily.  But no child had come to crown the\nhappiness of the pair who so loved each other till a good many years had\ncome and gone.  Then, when the hope of issue had almost passed away, a\nlittle daughter came.  Naturally the child was idolised by her parents,\nand thereafter every step taken by either was with an eye to her good.\nWhen the rigour of winter and the heat of summer told on the child in a\nway which the more hardy parents had never felt, she was whirled away to\nsome place with more promising conditions of health and happiness.  When\r\nthe doctors hinted that an ocean voyage and a winter in Italy would be\ngood, those too were duly undertaken.  And now, the child being in\nperfect health, the family was returning before the weather should get\ntoo hot to spend the summer at their chalet amongst the great pines on\nthe slopes of Mount Ranier.  Like the others on board, Mr. and Mrs.\nStonehouse had proffered travellers' civilities to the sad, lonely young\nman.  As to the others, he had shown thanks for their gracious courtesy;\nbut friendship, as in other cases, did not advance.  The Stonehouses were\r\nnot in any way chagrined; their lives were too happy and too full for\nthem to take needless offence.  They respected the young man's manifest\ndesire for privacy; and there, so far as they were concerned, the matter\nrested.\n\nBut this did not suit the child.  Pearl was a sweet little thing, a real\nblue-eyed, golden-haired little fairy, full of loving-kindness.  All the\nmother-instinct in her, and even at six a woman-child can be a\nmother--theoretically, went out towards the huge, lonely, sad, silent\nyoung man.  She insisted on friendship with him; insisted shamelessly,\r\nwith the natural inclination of innocence which rises high above shame.\nEven the half-hearted protests of the mother, who loved to see the child\nhappy, did not deter her; after the second occasion of Pearl's seeking\nhim, as she persisted, Harold could but remonstrate with the mother in\nturn; the ease of the gentle lady and the happiness of her child were\nmore or less at stake.  When Mrs. Stonehouse would say:\n\n'There, darling!  You must be careful not to annoy the gentleman,' Pearl\nwould turn a rosy all-commanding face to her and answer:","'But, mother, I want him to play with me.  You must play with me!'  Then,\nas the mother would look at him, he would say quickly, and with genuine\nheartiness too:\n\n'Oh please, madam, do let her play with me!  Come, Pearl, shall you ride\na cock-horse or go to market the way the gentleman rides?'  Then the\nchild would spring on his knee with a cry of delight, and their games\nbegan.\n\nThe presence of the child and her loving ways were unutterably sweet to\nHarold; but his pleasure was always followed by a pain that rent him as\r\nhe thought of that other little one, now so far away, and of those times\nthat seemed so long since gone.\n\nBut the child never relaxed in her efforts to please; and in the long\nhours of the sea voyage the friendship between her and the man grew, and\ngrew.  He was the biggest and strongest and therefore most lovely thing\non board the ship, and that sufficed her.  As for him, the child\nmanifestly loved and trusted him, and that was all-in-all to his weary,\ndesolate heart.\n\nThe fifth day out the weather began to change; the waves grew more and\r\nmore mountainous as the day wore on and the ship advanced west.  Not even\nthe great bulk and weight of the ship, which ordinarily drove through the\nseas without pitch or roll, were proof against waves so gigantic.  Then\nthe wind grew fiercer and fiercer, coming in roaring squalls from the\nsouth-west.  Most of those on board were alarmed, for the great waves\nwere dreadful to see, and the sound of the wind was a trumpet-call to\nfear.\n\nThe sick stayed in their cabins; the rest found an interest if not a\npleasure on deck.  Among the latter were the Stonehouses, who were old\r\ntravellers.  Even Pearl had already had more sea-voyages than fall to\nmost people in their lives.  As for Harold, the storm seemed to come\nquite naturally to him and he paced the deck like a ship-master.\n\nIt was fortunate for the passengers that most of them had at this period\nof the voyage got their sea legs; otherwise walking on the slippery deck,\nthat seemed to heave as the rolling of the vessel threw its slopes up or\ndown, would have been impossible.  Pearl was, like most children, pretty\nsure-footed; holding fast to Harold's hand she managed to move about","ceaselessly.  She absolutely refused to go with any one else.  When her\nmother said that she had better sit still she answered:\n\n'But, mother, I am quite safe with The Man!'  'The Man' was the name she\nhad given Harold, and by which she always now spoke of him.  They had had\na good many turns together, and Harold had, with the captain's\npermission, taken her up on the bridge and showed her how to look out\nover the 'dodger' without the wind hurting her eyes.  Then came the\nwelcome beef-tea hour, and all who had come on deck were cheered and\r\nwarmed with the hot soup.  Pearl went below, and Harold, in the shelter\nof the charthouse, together with a good many others, looked out over the\nwild sea.\n\nHarold, despite the wild turmoil of winds and seas around him, which\nusually lifted his spirits, was sad, feeling lonely and wretched; he was\nsuffering from the recoil of his little friend's charming presence.  Pearl\ncame on deck again looking for him.  He did not see her, and the child,\nseeing an opening for a new game, avoided both her father and mother, who\r\nalso stood in the shelter of the charthouse, and ran round behind it on\nthe weather side, calling a loud 'Boo!' to attract Harold's attention as\nshe ran.\n\nA few seconds later the _Scoriac_ put her nose into a coming wave at just\nthe angle which makes for the full exercise of the opposing forces.  The\ngreat wave seemed to strike the ship on the port quarter like a giant\nhammer; and for an instant she stood still, trembling.  Then the top of\nthe wave seemed to leap up and deluge her.  The wind took the flying\nwater and threw it high in volumes of broken spray, which swept not only\r\nthe deck but the rigging as high as the top of the funnels.  The child\nsaw the mass of water coming, and shrieking flew round the port side of\nthe charthouse.  But just as she turned down the open space between it\nand the funnel the vessel rolled to starboard.  At the same moment came a\npuff of wind of greater violence than ever.  The child, calling out, half\nin simulated half in real fear, flew down the slope.  As she did so the\ngale took her, and in an instant whirled her, almost touching her mother,\nover the rail into the sea.","Mrs. Stonehouse shrieked and sprang forward as though to follow her\nchild.  She was held back by the strong arm of her husband.  They both\nslipped on the sloping deck and fell together into the scuppers.  There\nwas a chorus of screams from all the women present.  Harold, with an\ninstinctive understanding of the dangers yet to be encountered, seized a\nred tam-o'-shanter from the head of a young girl who stood near.\n\nHer exclamation of surprise was drowned in the fearful cry 'Man\noverboard!' and all rushed down to the rail and saw Harold, as he emerged\r\nfrom the water, pull the red cap over his head and then swim desperately\ntowards the child, whose golden hair was spread on the rising wave.\n\nThe instant after Pearl's being swept overboard might be seen the\nsplendid discipline of a well-ordered ship.  Every man to his post, and\nevery man with a knowledge of his duty.  The First Officer called to the\nQuartermaster at the wheel in a voice which cut through the gale like a\ntrumpet:\n\n'Hard a port!  Hard!'\n\nThe stern of the great ship swung away to port in time to clear the\nfloating child from the whirling screw, which would have cut her to\r\npieces in an instant.  Then the Officer after tearing the engine-room\nsignal to 'Starboard engine full speed astern,' ran for the lifebuoy\nhanging at the starboard end of the bridge.  This he hurled far into the\nsea.  As it fell the attached rope dragged with it the signal, which so\nsoon as it reaches water bursts into smoke and flame--signal by day and\nnight.  This done, and it had all been done in a couple of seconds, he\nworked the electric switch of the syren, which screamed out quickly once,\ntwice, thrice.  This is the dread sound which means 'man overboard,' and\r\ndraws to his post every man on the ship, waking or sleeping.\n\nThe Captain was now on the bridge and in command, and the First Officer,\nfreed from his duty there, ran to the emergency boat, swung out on its\ndavits on the port side.\n\nAll this time, though only numbered by seconds, the _Scoriac_ was turning\nhard to starboard, making a great figure of eight; for it is quicker to\nturn one of these great sea monsters round than to stop her in mid\ncareer.  The aim of her Captain in such cases is to bring her back to the","weather side of the floating buoy before launching the boat.\n\nOn deck the anguish of the child's parents was pitiable.  Close to the\nrail, with her husband's arms holding her tight to it, the distressed\nmother leaned out; but always moving so that she was at the nearest point\nof the ship to her child.  As the ship passed on it became more difficult\nto see the heads.  In the greater distance they seemed to be quite close\ntogether.  All at once, just as a great wave which had hidden them in the\nfarther trough passed on, the mother screamed out:\r\n'She's sinking! she's sinking!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!' and she fell on her\nknees, her horrified eyes, set in a face of ashen grey, looking out\nbetween the rails.\n\nBut at the instant all eyes saw the man's figure rise in the water as he\nbegan to dive.  There was a hush which seemed deadly; the onlookers\nfeared to draw breath.  And then the mother's heart leaped and her cry\nrang out again as two heads rose together in the waste of sea:\n\n'He has her!  He has her!  He has her!  Oh, thank God!  Thank God!' and\nfor a single instant she hid her face in her hands.\r\nThen when the fierce 'hurrah' of all on board had been hushed in\nexpectation, the comments broke forth.  Most of the passengers had by\nthis time got glasses of one kind or another.\n\n'See!  He's putting the cap on the child's head.  He's a cool one that.\nFancy him thinking of a red cap at such a time!'\n\n'Ay! we could see that cap, when it might be we couldn't see anything\nelse.'\n\n'Look!' this from an old sailor standing by his boat, 'how he's raisin'\nin the water.  He's keeping his body between her an' the spindrift till\r\nthe squall has passed.  That would choke them both in a wind like this if\nhe didn't know how to guard against it.  He's all right; he is!  The\nlittle maid is safe wi' him.'\n\n'Oh, bless you!  Bless you for those words,' said the mother, turning\ntowards him.  'At this moment the Second Officer, who had run down from\nthe bridge, touched Mr. Stonehouse on the shoulder.\n\n'The captain asked me to tell you, sir, that you and Mrs. Stonehouse had\nbetter come to him on the bridge.  You'll see better from there.'\n\nThey both hurried up, and the mother again peered out with fixed eyes.","The Captain tried to comfort her; laying his strong hand on her shoulder,\nhe said:\n\n'There, there!  Take comfort, ma'am.  She is in the hands of God!  All\nthat mortal man can do is being done.  And she is safer with that gallant\nyoung giant than she could be with any other man on the ship.  Look, how\nhe is protecting her!  Why he knows that all that can be done is being\ndone.  He is waiting for us to get to him, and is saving himself for it.\nAny other man who didn't know so much about swimming as he does would try\r\nto reach the lifebuoy; and would choke the two of them with the spindrift\nin the trying.  Mind how he took the red cap to help us see them.  He's a\nfine lad that; a gallant lad!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV--FROM THE DEEPS\n\n\nPresently the Captain handed Mrs. Stonehouse a pair of binoculars.  For\nan instant she looked through them, then handed them back and continued\ngazing out to where the two heads appeared--when they did appear on the\ncrest of the waves like pin-heads.  The Captain said half to himself and\nhalf to the father:\n\n'Mother's eyes!  Mother's eyes!' and the father understood.\r\nAs the ship swept back to the rescue, her funnels sending out huge\nvolumes of smoke which the gale beat down on the sea to leeward, the\nexcitement grew tenser and tenser.  Men dared hardly breathe; women wept\nand clasped their hands convulsively as they prayed.  In the emergency\nboat the men sat like statues, their oars upright, ready for instant use.\nThe officer stood with the falls in his hand ready to lower away.\n\nWhen opposite the lifebuoy, and about a furlong from Harold and Pearl,\nthe Captain gave the signal 'Stop,' and then a second later: 'Full speed\r\nastern.'\n\n'Ready, men!  Steady!'  As the coming wave slipping under the ship began\nto rise up her side, the officer freed the falls and the boat sank softly\ninto the lifting sea.\n\nInstantly the oars struck the water, and as the men bent to them a cheer\nrang out.\n\n* * * * *\n\nHarold and Pearl heard, and the man turning his head for a moment saw\nthat the ship was close at hand, gradually drifting down to the weather\nside of them.  He raised the child in his arms, saying:\n\n'Now, Pearl, wave your hand to mother and say, hurrah!'  The child, fired","into fresh hope, waved her tiny hand and cried 'Hurrah!  Hurrah!'  The\nsound could not reach the mother's ears; but she saw, and her heart\nleaped.  She too waved her hand, but she uttered no sound.  The sweet\nhigh voice of the child crept over the water to the ears of the men in\nthe boat, and seemed to fire their arms with renewed strength.\n\nA few more strokes brought them close, Harold with a last effort raised\nthe child in his arms as the boat drove down on them.  The boatswain\nleaning over the bow grabbed the child, and with one sweep of his strong\r\narm took her into the boat.  The bow oarsman caught Harold by the wrist.\nThe way of the boat took him for a moment under water; but the next man;\npulling his oar across the boat, stooped over and caught him by the\ncollar, and clung fast.  A few seconds more and he was hauled abroad.  A\nwild cheer from all on the _Scoriac_ came, sweeping down on the wind.\n\nWhen once the boat's head had been turned towards the ship, and the oars\nhad bent again to their work, they came soon within shelter.  When they\r\nhad got close enough ropes were thrown out, caught and made fast; and\nthen came down one of the bowlines which the seamen held ready along the\nrail of the lower deck.  This was seized by the boatswain, who placed it\nround him under his armpits.  Then, standing with the child in his arms\nhe made ready to be pulled up.  Pearl held out her arms to Harold, crying\nin fear:\n\n'No, no, let The Man take me!  I want to go with The Man!'  He said\nquietly so as not to frighten her:\n\n'No, no, dear!  Go with him!  He can do this better than I can!'  So she\r\nclung quietly to the seaman, holding her face pressed close against his\nshoulder.  As the men above pulled at the rope, keeping it as far as\npossible from the side of the vessel, the boatswain fended himself off\nwith his feet.  In a few seconds he was seized by eager hands and pulled\nover the rail, tenderly holding and guarding the child all the while.  In\nan instant she was in the arms of her mother, who had thrown herself upon\nher knees and pressed her close to her loving heart.  The child put her\nlittle arms around her neck and clung to her.  Then looking up and seeing","the grey pallor of her face, which even her great joy could not in a\nmoment efface, she stroked it and said:\n\n'Poor mother!  Poor mother!  And now I have made you all wet!'  Then,\nfeeling her father's hand on her head she turned and leaped into his\narms, where he held her close.\n\nHarold was the next to ascend.  He came amid a regular tempest of cheers,\nthe seamen joining with the passengers.  The officers, led by the Captain\nwaving his cap from the bridge, joined in the paean.\n\nThe boat was cast loose.  An instant after the engine bells tinkled:\r\n'Full speed ahead.'\n\nMrs. Stonehouse had no eyes but for her child, except for one other.  When\nHarold leaped down from the rail she rushed at him, all those around\ninstinctively making way for her.  She flung her arms around him and\nkissed him, and then before he could stop her sank to her knees at his\nfeet, and taking his hand kissed it.  Harold was embarrassed beyond all\nthinking.  He tried to take away his hand, but she clung tight to it.\n\n'No, no!' she cried.  'You saved my child!'\n\nHarold was a gentleman and a kindly one.  He said no word till she had\r\nrisen, still holding his hand, when he said quietly:\n\n'There! there!  Don't cry.  I was only too happy to be of service.  Any\nother man on board would have done the same.  I was the nearest, and\ntherefore had to be first.  That was all!'\n\nMr. Stonehouse came to him and said as he grasped Harold's hand so hard\nthat his fingers ached:\n\n'I cannot thank you as I would.  But you are a man and will understand.\nGod be good to you as you have been good to my child; and to her mother\nand myself!'  As he turned away Pearl, who had now been holding close to\r\nher mother's hand, sprang to him holding up her arms.  He raised her up\nand kissed her.  Then he placed her back in her mother's arms.\n\nAll at once she broke down as the recollection of danger swept back upon\nher.  'Oh, Mother!  Mother!' she cried, with a long, low wail, which\ntouched every one of her hearers to the heart's core.\n\n'The hot blankets are all ready.  Come, there is not a moment to be lost.\nI'll be with you when I have seen the men attended to!'\n\nSo the mother, holding her in her arms and steadied by two seamen lest","she should slip on the wet and slippery deck, took the child below.\n\nHarold was taken by another set of men, who rubbed him down till he\nglowed, and poured hot brandy and water into him till he had to almost\nuse force against the superabundance of their friendly ministrations.\n\nFor the remainder of that day a sort of solemn gladness ruled on the\n_Scoriac_.  The Stonehouse family remained in their suite, content in\nglad thankfulness to be with Pearl, who lay well covered up on the sofa\nsleeping off the effects of the excitement and the immersion, and the\r\nresult of the potation which the Doctor had forced upon her.  Harold was\nsimply shy, and objecting to the publicity which he felt to be his fate,\nremained in his cabin till the trumpet had blown the dinner call.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV--A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD\n\n\nAfter dinner Harold went back to his cabin; locking himself in, he lay\ndown on the sofa.  The gloom of his great sorrow was heavy on him; the\nreaction from the excitement of the morning had come.\n\nHe was recalled to himself by a gentle tapping.  Unlocking and opening\r\nthe door he saw Mr. Stonehouse, who said with trouble in his voice:\n\n'I came to you on account of my little child.'  There he stopped with a\nbreak in his voice.  Harold, with intent to set his mind at ease and to\nstave off further expressions of gratitude, replied:\n\n'Oh, pray don't say anything.  I am only too glad that I was privileged\nto be of service.  I only trust that the dear little girl is no worse for\nher--her adventure!'\n\n'That is why I am here,' said the father quickly.  'My wife and I are\nloth to trouble you.  But the poor little thing has worked herself into a\r\nparoxysm of fright and is calling for you.  We have tried in vain to\ncomfort or reassure her.  She will not be satisfied without you.  She\nkeeps calling on \"The Man\" to come and help her.  I am loth to put you to\nfurther strain after all you have gone through to-day; but if you would\ncome--'  Harold was already in the passage as he spoke:\n\n'Of course I'm coming.  If I can in any way help it is both a pleasure\nand a duty to be with her.'  Turning to the father he added:\n\n'She is indeed a very sweet and good child.  I shall never forget how she","bore herself whilst we waited for aid to come.'\n\n'You must tell her mother and me all about it,' said the father; much\nmoved.\n\nWhen they came close to the Stonehouses' suite of rooms they heard\nPearl's voice rising with a pitiful note of fear:\n\n'Where is The Man?  Oh! where is The Man?  Why doesn't he come to me?  He\ncan save me!  I want to be with The Man!'  When the door opened and she\nsaw him she gave shriek of delight, and springing from the arms of her\nmother fairly leaped into Harold's arms which were outstretched to\r\nreceive her.  She clung to him and kissed him again and again, rubbing\nher little hands all over his face as though to prove to herself that he\nwas real and not a dream.  Then with a sigh she laid her head on his\nbreast, the reaction of sleep coming all at once to her.  With a gesture\nof silence Harold sat down, holding the child in his arms.  Her mother\nlaid a thick shawl over and sat down close to Harold.  Mr. Stonehouse\nstood quiet in the doorway with the child's nurse peering anxiously over\nhis shoulder.\n\nAfter a little while, when he thought she was asleep, Harold rose and\r\nbegan to place her gently in the bunk.  But the moment he did so she\nwaked with a scream.  The fright in her eyes was terrible.  She clung to\nhim, moaning and crying out between her sobs:\n\n'Don't leave me!  Don't leave me!  Don't leave me!'  Harold was much\nmoved and held the little thing tight in his strong arms, saying to her:\n\n'No darling!  I shan't leave you!  Look in my eyes, dear, and I will\npromise you, and then you will be happy.  Won't you?'\n\nShe looked quickly up in his face.  Then she kissed him lovingly, and\r\nrested her head, but not sleepily this time, on his breast said:\n\n'Yes!  I'm not afraid now!  I'm going to stay with The Man!'  Presently\nMrs. Stonehouse, who had been thinking of ways and means, and of the\ncomfort of the strange man who had been so good to her child, said:\n\n'You will sleep with mother to-night, darling.  Mr. . . . The Man,' she\nsaid this with an appealing look of apology to Harold, 'The Man will stay\nby you till you are asleep . . . '  But she interrupted, not fretfully or\nargumentatively, but with a settled air of content:\n\n'No!  I'm going to sleep with The Man!'","'But, dear one,' the mother expostulated, 'The Man will want sleep too.'\n\n'All right, mother.  He can sleep too.  I'll be very good and lie quite\nquiet; but oh! mother, I can't sleep unless his arms are round me.  I'm\nafraid if they're not the sea will get me!' and she clung closer to\nHarold, tightening her arms round his neck.\n\n'You will not mind?' asked Mrs. Stonehouse timidly to Harold; and, seeing\nacquiescence in his face, added in a burst of tearful gratitude:\n\n'Oh! you are good to her to us all!'\r\n'Hush!' Harold said quietly.  Then he said to Pearl, in a cheerful matter-\nof-fact way which carried conviction to the child's mind:\n\n'Now, darling, it is time for all good little girls to be asleep,\nespecially when they have had an--an interesting day.  You wait here till\nI put my pyjamas on, and then I'll come back for you.  And mother and\nfather shall come and see you nicely tucked in!'\n\n'Don't be long!' the child anxiously called after him as he hurried away.\nEven trust can have its doubts.\n\nIn a few minutes Harold was back, in pyjamas and slipper and a dressing-\r\ngown.  Pearl, already wrapped in a warm shawl by her mother, held out her\narms to Harold, who lifted her.\n\nThe Stonehouses' suite of rooms was close to the top of the companion-\nway, and as Harold's stateroom was on the saloon deck, the little\nprocession had, much to the man's concern, run the gauntlet of the thong\nof passengers whom the bad weather had kept indoors.  When he came out of\nthe day cabin carrying the child there was a rush of all the women to\nmake much of the little girl.  They were all very kind and no\ntroublesome; their interest was natural enough, and Harold stopped whilst\r\nthey petted the little thing.\n\nThe little procession followed.  Mr. and Mrs. Stonehouse coming next, and\nlast the nurse, who manifested a phase of the anxiety of a hen who sees\nher foster ducklings waddling toward a pond.\n\nWhen Harold was in his bunk the little maid was brought in.\n\nWhen they had all gone and the cabin was dark, save for the gleam from\nthe nightlight which the careful mother had placed out of sight in the\nbasin at the foot of the bunk, Harold lay a long time in a negative\nstate, if such be possible, in so far as thought was concerned.","Presently he became conscious of a movement of the child his arms; a\nshuddering movement, and a sort of smothered groan.  The little thing was\nliving over again in sleep the perils and fears of the day.  Instinctively\nshe put up her hands and felt the a round her.  Then with a sigh clasped\nher arms round his neck, and with a peaceful look laid her head upon his\nbreast.  Even through the gates of sleep her instinct had recognised and\nrealised protection.\n\nAnd then this trust of a little child brought back the man to his nobler\r\nself.  Once again came back to him that love which he had had, and which\nhe knew now that he had never lost, for the little child that he had seen\ngrow into full womanhood; whose image must dwell in his heart of hearts\nfor evermore.\n\nThe long night's sleep quite restored Pearl.  She woke fairly early and\nwithout any recurrence of fear.  At first she lay still, fearing she\nwould wake The Man, but finding that he was awake--he had not slept a\nwink all night--she kissed him and then scrambled out of bed.\n\nIt was still early morning, but early hours rule on shipland.  Harold\r\nrang for the steward, and when the man came he told him to tell Mr.\nStonehouse that the child was awake.  His delight when he found the child\nunfrightened looking out of the port was unbounded.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI--A NOBLE OFFER\n\n\nThat day Harold passed in unutterable gloom.  The reaction was strong on\nhim; and all his woe, his bitter remembrance of the past and his\ndesolation for the future, were with him unceasingly.\n\nIn the dusk of the evening he wandered out to his favourite spot, the\ncable-tank on top of the aft wheelhouse.  Here he had been all alone, and\r\nhis loneliness had the added advantage that from the isolated elevation\nhe could see if anyone approached.  He had been out there during the day,\nand the Captain, who had noticed his habit had had rigged up a canvas\ndodger on the rail on the weather side.  When he sat down on the coiled\nhawsers in the tank he was both secluded and sheltered.  In this peaceful\ncorner his thoughts ran freely and in sympathy with the turmoil of wind\nand wave.\n\nHow unfair it all was!  Why had he been singled out for such misery?  What","gleam of hope or comfort was left to his miserable life since he had\nheard the words of Stephen; those dreadful words which had shattered in\nan instant all the cherished hopes of his life.  Too well he remembered\nthe tone and look of scorn with which the horrible truths had been\nconveyed to him.  In his inmost soul he accepted them as truths;\nStephen's soul had framed them and Stephen's lips had sent them forth.\n\nFrom his position behind the screen he did not see the approaching figure\nof Mr. Stonehouse, and was astonished when he saw his head rise above the\r\nedge of the tank as he climbed the straight Jacob's ladder behind the\nwheelhouse.  The elder man paused as he saw him and said in an apologetic\nway:\n\n'Will you forgive my intruding on your privacy?  I wanted to speak to you\nalone; and as I saw you come here a while ago I thought it would be a\ngood opportunity.'  Harold was rising as he spoke.\n\n'By all means.  This place is common property.  But all the same I am\nhonoured in your seeking me.'  The poor fellow wished to be genial; but\ndespite his efforts there was a strange formality in the expression of\r\nhis words.  The elder man understood, and said as he hurried forward and\nsank beside him:\n\n'Pray don't stir!  Why, what a cosy corner this is.  I don't believe at\nthis moment there is such peace in the ship!'\n\nOnce again the bitterness of Harold's heart broke out in sudden words:\n\n'I hope not!  There is no soul on board to whom I could wish such evil!'\nThe old man said as he laid his hand softly on the other's shoulder:\n\n'God help you, my poor boy, if such pain is in your heart!'  Mr.\nStonehouse looked out at the sea, at last turning his face to him again\r\nhe spoke:\n\n'If you feel that I intrude on you I earnestly ask you to forgive me; but\nI think that the years between your age and mine as well as my feeling\ntowards the great obligation which I owe you will plead for excuse.  There\nis something I would like to say to you, sir; but I suppose I must not\nwithout your permission.  May I have it?'\n\n'If you wish, sir.  I can at least hear it.'\n\nThe old man bowed and went on:\n\n'I could not but notice that you have some great grief bearing upon you;\nand from one thing or another--I can tell you the data if you wish me to","do so--I have come to the conclusion that you are leaving your native\nland because of it.'  Here Harold, wakened to amazement by the readiness\nwith which his secret had been divined, said quickly, rather as an\nexclamation than interrogation:\n\n'How on earth did you know that!'  His companion, taking it as a query,\nanswered:\n\n'Sir, at your age and with your strength life should be a joy; and yet\nyou are sad: Companionship should be a pleasure; yet you prefer solitude.\nThat you are brave and unselfish I know; I have reason, thank God! to\r\nknow it.  That you are kindly and tolerant is apparent from your bearing\nto my little child this morning; as well as your goodness of last night,\nthe remembrance of which her mother and I will bear to our graves; and to\nme now.  I have not lived all these years without having had trouble in\nmy own heart; and although the happiness of late years has made it dim,\nmy gratitude to you who are so sad brings it all back to me.'  He bowed,\nand Harold, wishing to avoid speaking of his sorrow, said:\n\n'You are quite right so far as I have a sorrow; and it is because of it I\r\nhave turned my back on home.  Let it rest at that!'  His companion bowed\ngravely and went on.\n\n'I take it that you are going to begin life afresh in the new country.  In\nsuch case I have a proposition to make.  I have a large business; a\nbusiness so large that I am unable to manage it all myself.  I was\nintending that when I arrived at home I would set about finding a\npartner.  The man I want is not an ordinary man.  He must have brains and\nstrength and daring.'  He paused.  Harold felt what was coming, but\r\nrealised, as he jumped at the conclusion, that it would not do for him to\ntake for granted that he was the man sought.  He waited; Mr. Stonehouse\nwent on:\n\n'As to brains, I am prepared to take the existence of such on my own\njudgment.  I have been reading men, and in this aspect specially, all my\nlife.  The man I have thought of has brains.  I am satisfied of that,\nwithout proof.  I have proof of the other qualities.'  He paused again;\nas Harold said nothing he continued in a manner ill at ease:\n\n'My difficulty is to make the proposal to the man I want.  It is so","difficult to talk business to a man to whom you under great obligation;\nto whom you owe everything.  He might take a friendly overture ill.'\nThere was but one thing to be said and Harold said it.  His heart warmed\nto the kindly old man and he wished to spare him pain; even if he could\nnot accept him proposition:\n\n'He couldn't take it ill; unless he was an awful bounder.'\n\n'It was you I thought of!'\n\n'I thought so much, sir;' said Harold after a pause, 'and I thank you\nearnestly and honestly.  But it is impossible.'\r\n'Oh, my dear sir!' said the other, chagrined as well as surprised.  'Think\nagain!  It is really worth your while to think of it, no matter what your\nultimate decision may be!'\n\nHarold shook his head.  There was a long silence.  The old man wished to\ngive his companion time to think; and indeed he thought that Harold was\nweighing the proposition in his mind.  As for Harold, he was thinking how\nbest he could make his absolute refusal inoffensive.  He must, he felt,\ngive some reason; and his thoughts were bent on how much of the truth he\r\ncould safely give without endangering his secret.  Therefore he spoke at\nlast in general terms:\n\n'I can only ask you, sir, to bear with me and to believe that I am very\ntruly and sincerely grateful to you for your trust.  But the fact is, I\ncannot go anywhere amongst people.  Of course you understand that I am\nspeaking in confidence; to you alone and to none other?'\n\n'Absolutely!' said Mr. Stonehouse gravely.  Harold went on:\n\n'I must be alone.  I can only bear to see people on this ship because it\nis a necessary way to solitude.'\r\n'You \"cannot go anywhere amongst people\"!  Pardon me.  I don't wish to be\nunduly inquisitive; but on my word I fail to understand!'  Harold was in\na great difficulty.  Common courtesy alone forbade that he should leave\nthe matter where it was; and in addition both the magnificently generous\noffer which had been made to him, and the way in which accident had\nthrown him to such close intimacy with Pearl's family, required that he\nshould be at least fairly frank.  At last in a sort of cold desperation\nhe said:\n\n'I cannot meet anyone . . . There it something that happened . . .","Something I did . . . Nothing can make it right . . . All I can do is to\nlose myself in the wildest, grimmest, wilderness in the world; and fight\nmy pain . . . my shame . . . !'\n\nA long silence.  Then the old man's voice came clear and sweet, something\nlike music, in the shelter from the storm:\n\n'But perhaps time may mend things.  God is very good . . . !'  Harold\nanswered out of the bitterness of his heart.  He felt that his words were\nladen with an anger which he did not feel, but he did not see his way to\nalter them:\n\n'Nothing can mend this thing!  It is at the farthest point of evil; and\r\nthere is no going on or coming back.  Nothing can wipe out what is done;\nwhat is past!'\n\nAgain silence, and again the strong, gentle voice:\n\n'God can do much!  Oh my dear young friend, you who have been such a\nfriend to me and mine, think of this.'\n\n'God Himself can do nothing here!  It is done!  And that is the end!'  He\nturned his head; it was all he could do to keep from groaning.  The old\nman's voice vibrated with earnest conviction as he spoke:\n\n'You are young and strong and brave!  Your heart is noble!  You can think\r\nquickly in moments of peril; therefore your brain is sound and alert.\nNow, may I ask you a favour? it is not much.  Only that you will listen,\nwithout interruption, to what, if I have your permission, I am going to\nsay.  Do not ask me anything; do not deny; do not interrupt!  Only\nlisten!  May I ask this?'\n\n'By all means!  It is not much!' he almost felt like smiling as he spoke.\nMr. Stonehouse, after a short pause, as if arranging his thoughts, spoke:\n\n'Let me tell you what I am.  I began life with nothing but a fair\r\neducation such as all our American boys get.  But from a good mother I\ngot an idea that to be honest was the best of all things; from a\nstrenuous father, who, however, could not do well for himself, I learned\napplication to work and how best to use and exercise such powers as were\nin me.  From the start things prospered with me.  Men who knew me trusted\nme; some came with offers to share in my enterprise.  Thus I had command\nof what capital I could use; I was able to undertake great works and to\ncarry them through.  Fortune kept growing and growing; for as I got","wealthier I found newer and larger and more productive uses for my money.\nAnd in all my work I can say before God I never willingly wronged any\nman.  I am proud to be able to say that my name stands good wherever it\nhas been used.  It may seem egotistical that I say such things of myself.\nIt may seem bad taste; but I speak because I have a motive in so doing.  I\nwant you to understand at the outset that in my own country, wherever I\nam known and in my own work, my name is a strength.'\n\nHe paused a while.  Harold sat still; he knew that such man would not,\r\ncould not, speak in such a way without a strong motive; and to learn that\nmotive he waited.\n\n'When you were in the water making what headway you could in that awful\nsea--when my little child's life hung in the balance, and the anguish of\nmy wife's heart nearly tore my heart in two, I said to myself, \"If we had\na son I should wish him to be like that.\"  I meant it then, and I mean it\nnow!  Come to me as you are!  Faults, and past, and all.  Forget the\npast!  Whatever it was we will together try to wipe it out.  Much may be\r\ndone in restoring where there has been any wrong-doing.  Take my name as\nyour own.  It will protect you from the result of what ever has been, and\ngive you an opportunity to find your place again.  You are not bad in\nheart I know.  Whatever you have done has not been from base motives.  Few\nof us are spotless as to facts.  You and I will show ourselves--for\nunless God wills to the opposite we shall confide in none other--that a\nstrong, brave man may win back all that was lost.  Let me call you by my\nname and hold you as the son of my heart; and it will be a joy and\r\npleasure to my declining years.'\n\nAs he had spoken, Harold's thought's had at first followed in some\nwonderment.  But gradually, as his noble purpose unfolded, based as it\nwas on a misconception as to the misdoing of which he himself had spoken,\nhe had been almost stricken dumb.  At the first realisation of what was\nintended he could not have spoken had he tried; but at the end he had\nregained his thoughts and his voice.  There was still wonderment in it,\nas realising from the long pause that the old man had completed his\nsuggestion, he spoke:","'If I understand aright you are offering me your name!  Offering to share\nyour honour with me.  With me, whom, if again I understand, you take as\nhaving committed some crime?'\n\n'I inferred from what you said and from your sadness, your desire to shun\nyour kind, that there was, if not a crime, some fault which needed\nexpiation.'\n\n'But your honour, sir; your honour!'  There was a proud look in the old\nman's eyes as he said quietly:\n\n'It was my desire, is my desire, to share with you what I have that is\r\nbest; and that, I take it, is not the least valuable of my possessions,\nsuch as they are!  And why not?  You have given to me all that makes life\nsweet; without which it would be unbearable.  That child who came to my\nwife and me when I was old and she had passed her youth is all in all to\nus both.  Had your strength and courage been for barter in the moments\nwhen my child was quivering between life and death, I would have\ncheerfully purchased them with not half but all!  Sir, I should have\ngiven my soul!  I can say this now, for gratitude is above all barter;\r\nand surely it is allowed to a father to show gratitude for the life of\nhis child!'\n\nThis great-hearted generosity touched Harold to the quick.  He could\nhardly speak for a few minutes.  Then instinctively grasping the old\nman's hand he said:\n\n'You overwhelm me.  Such noble trust and generosity as you have shown me\ndemands a return of trust.  But I must think!  Will you remain here and\nlet me return to you in a little while?'\n\nHe rose quickly and slipped down the iron ladder, passing into the\ndarkness and the mist and the flying spray.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII--AGE'S WISDOM\r\nHarold went to and fro on the deserted deck.  All at once the course he\nhad to pursue opened out before him.  He was aware that what the noble-\nminded old man offered him was fortune, great fortune in any part of the\nworld.  He would have to be refused, but the refusal should be gently\ndone.  He, believing that the other had done something very wrong, had\nstill offered to share with him his name, his honour.  Such confidence\ndemanded full confidence in return; the unwritten laws which governed the\nmen amongst whom he had been brought up required it.","And the shape that confidence should take?  He must first disabuse his\nnew friend's mind of criminal or unworthy cause for his going away.  For\nthe sake of his own name and that of his dead father that should be done.\nThen he would have to suggest the real cause . . . He would in this have\nto trust Mr. Stonehouse's honour for secrecy.  But he was worthy of\ntrust.  He would, of course, give no name, no clue; but he would put\nthings generally in a way that he could understand.\n\nWhen his mind was so far made up he wanted to finish the matter, so he\r\nturned to the wheelhouse and climbed the ladder again.  It was not till\nhe sat in the shelter by his companion that he became aware that he had\nbecome wet with the spray.  The old man wishing to help him in his\nembarrassment said:\n\n'Well?' Harold began at once; the straightforward habit of his life stood\nto him now:\n\n'Let me say first, sir, what will I know give you pleasure.'  The old man\nextended his hand; he had been hoping for acceptance, and this seemed\nlike it.  Harold laid his hand on it for an instant only, and then raised\nit as if to say 'Wait':\r\n'You have been so good to me, so nobly generous in your wishes that I\nfeel I owe you a certain confidence.  But as it concerns not myself alone\nI will ask that it be kept a secret between us two.  Not to be told to\nany other; not even your wife!'\n\n'I will hold your secret sacred.  Even from my wife; the first secret I\nshall have ever kept from her.'\n\n'First, then, let me say, and this is what I know will rejoice you, that\nI am not leaving home and country because of any crime I have committed;\nnot from any offence against God or man, or law.  Thank God! I am free\r\nfrom such.  I have always tried to live uprightly . . . '  Here a burst\nof pain overcame him, and with a dry sob he added: 'And that is what\nmakes the terrible unfairness of it all!'\n\nThe old man laid a kindly hand on his shoulder and kept it there for a\nfew moments.\n\n'My poor boy!  My poor boy!' was all he said.  Harold shook himself as if\nto dislodge the bitter thoughts.  Mastering himself he went on:\n\n'There was a lady with whom I was very much thrown in contact since we\nwere children.  Her father was my father's friend.  My friend too, God","knows; for almost with his dying breath he gave sanction to my marrying\nhis daughter, if it should ever be that she should care for me in that\nway.  But he wished me to wait, and, till she was old enough to choose,\nto leave her free.  For she is several years younger than I am; and I am\nnot very old yet--except in heart!  All this, you understand, was said in\nprivate to me; none other knew it.  None knew of it even till this moment\nwhen I tell you that such a thing has been.'  He paused; the other said:\n\n'Believe me that I value your confidence, beyond all words!'  Harold felt\r\nalready the good effects of being able to speak of his pent-up trouble.\nAlready this freedom from the nightmare loneliness of his own thoughts\nseemed to be freeing his very soul.\n\n'I honestly kept to his wishes.  Before God, I did!  No man who loved a\nwoman, honoured her, worshipped her, could have been more scrupulously\ncareful as to leaving her free.  What it was to me to so hold myself no\none knows; no one ever will know.  For I loved her, do love her, with\nevery nerve and fibre of my heart.  All our lives we had been friends;\r\nand I believed we loved and trusted each other.  But . . . but then there\ncame a day when I found by chance that a great trouble threatened her.\nNot from anything wrong that she had done; but from something perhaps\nfoolish, harmlessly foolish except that she did not know . . . '  He\nstopped suddenly, fearing he might have said overmuch of Stephen's side\nof the affair.  'When I came to her aid, however, meaning the best, and\nas single-minded as a man can be, she misunderstood my words, my meaning,\nmy very coming; and she said things which cannot be unsaid.  Things . . .\r\nmatters were so fixed that I could not explain; and I had to listen.  She\nsaid things that I did not believe she could have said to me, to anyone.\nThings that I did not think she could have thought . . . I dare say she\nwas right in some ways.  I suppose I bungled in my desire to be\nunselfish.  What she said came to me in new lights upon what I had done\n. . . But anyhow her statements were such that I felt I could not, should\nnot, remain.  My very presence must have been a trouble to her hereafter.","There was nothing for it but to come away.  There was no place for me!  No\nhope for me!  There is none on this side of the grave! . . . For I love\nher still, more than ever.  I honour and worship her still, and ever\nwill, and ever must! . . . I am content to forego my own happiness; but I\nfeel there is a danger to her from what has been.  That there is and must\nbe to her unhappiness even from the fact that it was I who was the object\nof her wrath; and this adds to my woe.  Worst of all is . . . the thought\nand the memory that she should have done so; she who . . . she . . . '\r\nHe turned away overcome and hid his face in his hands.  The old man sat\nstill; he knew that at such a moment silence is the best form of\nsympathy.  But his heart glowed; the wisdom of his years told him that he\nhad heard as yet of no absolute bar to his friend's ultimate happiness.\n\n'I am rejoiced, my dear boy, at what you tell me of your own conduct.  It\nwould have made no difference to me had it been otherwise.  But it would\nhave meant a harder and longer climb back to the place you should hold.\nBut it really seems that nothing is so hopeless as you think.  Believe\r\nme, my dear young friend who are now as a son to my heart, that there\nwill be bright days for you yet . . . '  He paused a moment, but\nmastering himself went on in a quiet voice:\n\n'I think you are wise to go away.  In the solitudes and in danger things\nthat are little in reality will find their true perspective; and things\nthat are worthy will appear in their constant majesty.'\n\nHe stood, and laying once again his hand on the young man's shoulder\nsaid:\n\n'I recognise that I--that we, for my wife and little girl would be at one\r\nwith me in my wish, did they know of it, must not keep you from your\npurpose of fighting out your trouble alone.  Every man, as the Scotch\nproverb says, must \"dree his own weird.\"  I shall not, I must not, ask\nyou for any promise; but I trust that if ever you do come back you will\nmake us all glad by seeing you.  And remember that what I said of myself\nand of all I have--all--holds good so long as I shall live!'\n\nBefore Harold could reply he had slipped down the ladder and was gone.\n\nDuring the rest of the voyage, with the exception of one occasion, he did","not allude to the subject again by word or implication, and Harold was\ngrateful to him for it.\n\nOn the night before Fire Island should be sighted Harold was in the bow\nof the great ship looking out with eyes in which gleamed no hope.  To him\ncame through the darkness Mr. Stonehouse.  He heard the footsteps and\nknew them; so with the instinct of courtesy, knowing that his friend\nwould not intrude on his solitude without purpose, he turned and met him.\nWhen the American stood beside him he said, studiously avoiding looking\nat his companion:\r\n'This is the last night we shall be together, and, if I may, there is one\nthing I would like to say to you.'\n\n'Say all you like, sir,' said Harold as heartily as he could, 'I am sure\nit is well meant; and for that at any rate I shall be grateful to you.'\n\n'You will yet be grateful, I think!' he answered gravely.  'When it comes\nback to you in loneliness and solitude you will, I believe, think it\nworth being grateful for.  I don't mean that you will be grateful to me,\nbut for the thing itself.  I speak out of the wisdom of many years.  At\r\nyour time of life the knowledge cannot come from observation.  It may my\npoor boy, come through pain; and if what I think is correct you will even\nin due time be grateful to the pain which left such golden residuum.'  He\npaused, and Harold grew interested.  There was something in the old man's\nmanner which presaged a truth; he, at least, believed it.  So the young\nman listened at first with his ears; and as the other spoke, his heart\nlistened too:\n\n'Young men are apt to think somewhat wrongly of women they love and\r\nrespect.  We are apt to think that such women are of a different clay\nfrom ourselves.  Nay! that they are not compact of clay at all, but of\nsome faultless, flawless material which the Almighty keeps for such fine\nwork.  It is only in middle age that men--except scamps, who learn this\nbad side of knowledge young--realise that women are human beings like\nthemselves.  It may be, you know, that you may have misjudged this young\nlady!  That you have not made sufficient allowance for her youth, her\nnature, even the circumstances under which she spoke.  You have told me","that she was in some deep grief or trouble.  May it not have been that\nthis in itself unnerved her, distorted her views, aroused her passion\ntill all within and around was tinged with the jaundice of her concern,\nher humiliation--whatever it was that destroyed for the time that normal\nself which you had known so long.  May it not have been that her\nbitterest memory even since may be of the speaking of these very words\nwhich sent you out into the wide world to hide yourself from men.  I have\nthought, waking and sleeping, of your position ever since you honoured me\r\nwith your confidence; and with every hour the conviction has strengthened\nin me that there is a way out of this situation which sends a man like\nyou into solitude with a heart hopeless and full of pain; and which\nleaves her perhaps in greater pain, for she has not like you the complete\nsense of innocence.  But at present there is no way out but through time\nand thought.  Whatever may be her ideas or wishes she is powerless.  She\ndoes not know your thoughts, no matter how she may guess at them.  She\ndoes not know where you are or how to reach you, no matter how complete\r\nher penitence may be.  And oh! my dear young friend, remember that you\nare a strong man, and she is a woman.  Only a woman in her passion and\nher weakness after all.  Think this all over, my poor boy!  You will have\ntime and opportunity where you are going.  God help you to judge wisely!'\nAfter a pause of a few seconds he said abruptly: 'Good night!' and moved\nquickly away.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen the time for parting came Pearl was inconsolable.  Not knowing any\nreason why The Man should not do as she wished she was persistent in her\r\npetitions to Harold that he should come with her, and to her father and\nmother that they should induce him to do so.  Mrs. Stonehouse would have\nwished him to join them if only for a time.  Her husband, unable to give\nany hint without betraying confidence, had to content himself with trying\nto appease his little daughter by vague hopes rather than promises that\nher friend would join them at some other time.\n\nWhen the _Scoriac_ was warped at the pier there was a tendency on the\npart of the passengers to give Harold a sort of public send-off; but","becoming aware of it he hurried down the gangway without waiting.  Having\nonly hand luggage, for he was to get his equipment in New York, he had\ncleared and passed the ring of customs officers before the most\nexpeditious of the other passengers had collected their baggage.  He had\nsaid good-bye to the Stonehouses in their own cabin.  Pearl had been so\nmuch affected at saying good-bye, and his heart had so warmed to her,\nthat at last he had said impulsively:\n\n'Don't cry, darling.  If I am spared I shall come back to you within\r\nthree years.  Perhaps I will write before then; but there are not many\npost-offices where I am going to!'\n\nChildren are easily satisfied.  Their trust makes a promise a real thing;\nand its acceptance is the beginning of satisfaction.  But for weeks after\nthe parting she had often fits of deep depression, and at such times her\ntears always flowed.  She took note of the date, and there was never a\nday that she did not think of and sigh for The Man.\n\nAnd The Man, away in the wilds of Alaska, was feeling, day by day and\r\nhour by hour, the chastening and purifying influences of the wilderness.\nHot passions cooled before the breath of the snowfield and the glacier.\nThe moaning of a tortured spirit was lost in the roar of the avalanche\nand the scream of the cyclone.  Pale sorrow and cold despair were warmed\nand quickened by the fierce sunlight which came suddenly and stayed only\nlong enough to vitalise all nature.\n\nAnd as the first step to understanding, The Man forgot himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII--DE LANNOY\n\n\nTwo years!\n\nNot much to look back upon, but a world to look forward to.  To Stephen,\r\ndowered though she was with rare personal gifts and with wealth and\nposition accorded to but few, the hours of waiting were longer than the\nyears that were past.  Yet the time had new and startling incidents for\nher.  Towards Christmas in the second year the Boer war had reached its\nclimax of evil.  As the news of disaster after disaster was flashed\nthrough the cable she like others felt appalled at the sacrifices that\nwere being exacted by the God of War.\n\nOne day she casually read in The Times that the Earl de Lannoy had died","in his London mansion, and further learned that he had never recovered\nfrom the shock of hearing that his two sons and his nephew had been\nkilled.  The paragraph concluded: \"By his death the title passes to a\ndistant relative.  The new Lord de Lannoy is at present in India with his\nregiment, the 35th or 'Grey' Hussars, of which he is Colonel.\"  She gave\nthe matter a more than passing thought, for it was sad to find a whole\nfamily thus wiped out at a blow.\n\nEarly in February she received a telegram from her London solicitor\r\nsaying that he wished to see her on an important matter.  Her answer was:\n\"Come at once\"; and at tea-time Mr. Copleston arrived.  He was an old\nfriend and she greeted him warmly.  She was a little chilled when he\nanswered with what seemed unusual deference:\n\n'I thank your Ladyship for your kindness!'  She raised her eyebrows but\nmade no comment: she was learning to be silent under surprise.  When she\nhad handed the old gentleman his tea she said:\n\n'My aunt has chosen to remain away, thinking that you might wish to see\nme privately.  But I take it that there is nothing which she may not\r\nshare.  I have no secrets from her.'\n\nHe rubbed his hands genially as he replied:\n\n'Not at all; not at all!  I should like her to be present.  It will, I am\nsure, be a delight to us all.'\n\nAgain raised eyebrows; again silence on the subject.  When a servant\nanswered her bell she told him to ask Miss Rowly if she would kindly join\nthem.\n\nAunt Laetitia and the solicitor were old cronies, and their greeting was\nmost friendly.  When the old gentlewoman had seated herself and taken her\ncup of tea, Mr. Copleston said to Stephen, with a sort of pomposity:\r\n'I have to announce your succession to the Earldom de Lannoy!'\n\nStephen sat quite still.  She knew the news was true; Mr. Copleston was\nnot one who would jest on a business subject, and too accurate a lawyer\nto make an error in a matter of fact.  But the fact did not seem to touch\nher.  It was not that she was indifferent to it; few women could hear\nsuch news without a thrill.  Mr. Copleston seemed at a loss.  Miss Rowly\nrose and quietly kissed her, and saying simply, 'God bless you, my dear!'\nwent back to her seat.","Realising that Mr. Copleston expected some acknowledgment, Stephen held\nout her hand to him and said quietly:\n\n'Thank you!'\n\nAfter a long pause she added quietly:\n\n'Now, won't you tell us about it?  I am in absolute ignorance; and don't\nunderstand.'\n\n'I had better not burden you, at first, with too many details, which can\ncome later; but give you a rough survey of the situation.'\n\n'Your title of Countess de Lannoy comes to you through your ancestor\nIsobel, third and youngest daughter of the sixth Earl; Messrs Collinbrae\r\nand Jackson, knowing that my firm acted for your family, communicated\nwith us.  Lest there should be any error we followed most carefully every\ndescendant and every branch of the family, for we thought it best not to\ncommunicate with you till your right of inheritance was beyond dispute.\nWe arrived independently at the same result as Messrs. Collinbrae and\nJackson.  There is absolutely no doubt whatever of your claim.  You will\npetition the Crown, and on reference to the House of Lords the Committee\nfor Privileges will admit your right.  May I offer my congratulations,\r\nLady de Lannoy on your acquisition?  By the way, I may say that all the\nestates of the Earldom, which have been from the first kept in strict\nentail, go with the title de Lannoy.'\n\nDuring the recital Stephen was conscious of a sort of bitter comment on\nthe tendencies of good fortune.\n\n'Too late! too late!' something seemed to whisper, 'what delight it would\nhave been had Father inherited . . . If Harold had not gone . . . !'  All\nthe natural joy seemed to vanish, as bubbles break into empty air.\n\nTo Aunt Laetitia the new title was a source of pride and joy, far greater\r\nthan would have been the case had it come to herself.  She had for so\nmany years longed for new honours for Stephen that she had almost come to\nregard them as a right whose coming should not be too long delayed.  Miss\nRowly had never been to Lannoy; and, indeed, she knew personally nothing\nof the county Angleshire in which it was situated.  She was naturally\nanxious to see the new domain; but kept her feeling concealed during the\nmonths that elapsed until Stephen's right had been conceded by the\nCommittee for Privileges.  But after that her impatience became manifest","to Stephen, who said one day in a teasing, caressing way, as was\nsometimes her wont:\n\n'Why, Auntie, what a hurry you are in!  Lannoy will keep, won't it?'\n\n'Oh, my dear,' she replied, shaking her head, 'I can understand your own\nreticence, for you don't want to seem greedy and in a hurry about your\nnew possessions.  But when people come to my age there's no time to\nwaste.  I feel I would not have complete material for happiness in the\nWorld-to-come, if there were not a remembrance of my darling in her new\nhome!'\n\nStephen was much touched; she said impulsively:\r\n'We shall go to-morrow, Auntie.  No!  Let us go to-day.  You shall not\nwait an hour that I can help!'  She ran to the bell; but before her hand\nwas on the cord the other said:\n\n'Not yet!  Stephen dear.  It would flurry me to start all at once; to-\nmorrow will be time enough.  And that will give you time to send word so\nthat they will be prepared for your coming.'\n\nHow often do we look for that to-morrow which never comes?  How often do\nwe find that its looked-for rosy tints are none other than the\ngloom-laden grey of the present?\r\nBefore the morrow's sun was high in the heavens Stephen was hurriedly\nsummoned to her aunt's bedside.  She lay calm and peaceful; but one side\nof her face was alive and the other seemingly dead.  In the night a\nparalytic stroke had seized her.  The doctors said she might in time\nrecover a little, but she would never be her old active self again.  She\nherself, with much painful effort, managed to convey to Stephen that she\nknew the end was near.  Stephen, knowing the wish of her heart and\nthinking that it might do her good to gratify her wish, asked if she\r\nshould arrange that she be brought to Lannoy.  Feebly and slowly, word by\nword, she managed to convey her idea.\n\n'Not now, dear one.  I shall see it all in time!--Soon!  And I shall\nunderstand and rejoice!'  For a long time she lay still, holding with her\nright hand, which was not paralysed, the other's hand.  Then she\nmurmured:\n\n'You will find happiness there!'  She said no more; but seemed to sleep.\n\nFrom that sleep she never woke, but faded slowly, softly away.\n\nStephen was broken-hearted.  Now, indeed, she felt alone and desolate.","All were gone.  Father, uncle, aunt!--And  Harold.  The kingdoms of the\nEarth which lay at her feet were of no account.  One hour of the dead or\ndeparted, any of them, back again were worth them all!\n\nNormanstand was now too utterly lonely to be endurable; so Stephen\ndetermined to go, for a time at any rate, to Lannoy.  She was becoming\naccustomed to be called 'my lady' and 'your ladyship,' and the new\nloneness made her feel better prepared to take her place amongst new\nsurroundings.\n\nIn addition, there was another spur to her going.  Leonard Everard,\r\nknowing of her absolute loneliness, and feeling that in it was a\npossibility of renewing his old status, was beginning to make himself\napparent.  He had learned by experience a certain wisdom, and did not put\nhimself forward obtrusively.  But whenever they met he looked at her so\nmeekly and so lovingly that it brought remembrances which came with\nblushes.  So, all at once, without giving time for the news to permeate\nthrough the neighbourhood, she took her way to Lannoy with a few\nservants.\n\nStephen's life had hitherto been spent inland.  She had of course now and\r\nagain been for short periods to various places; but the wonder of the sea\nas a constant companion had been practically unknown to her.\n\nNow at her new home its full splendour burst upon her; and so impressed\nitself upon her that new life seemed to open.\n\nLannoy was on the north-eastern coast, the castle standing at the base of\na wide promontory stretching far into the North Sea.  From the coast the\nland sloped upward to a great rolling ridge.  The outlook seaward was\nover a mighty expanse of green sward, dotted here and there with woods\r\nand isolated clumps of trees which grew fewer and smaller as the rigour\nof the northern sea was borne upon them by the easterly gales.\n\nThe coast was a wild and lonely one.  No habitation other than an\nisolated fisher's cottage was to be seen between the little fishing-port\nat the northern curve away to the south, where beyond a waste of\nsandhills and strand another tiny fishing-village nestled under a high\ncliff, sheltering it from northerly wind.  For centuries the lords of\nLannoy had kept their magnificent prospect to themselves; and though they","had treated their farmers and cottagers well, none had ever been allowed\nto settle in the great park to seaward of the castle.\n\nFrom the terrace of the castle only than one building, other than the\ncottage on the headland, could be seen.  Far off on the very crest of the\nridge was the tower of an old windmill.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX--THE SILVER LADY\n\n\nWhen it was known that Lady de Lannoy had come to Lannoy there was a\nprompt rush of such callers as the county afforded.  Stephen, however,\ndid not wish to see anyone just at present.  Partly to avoid the chance\r\nmeeting with strangers, and partly because she enjoyed and benefited by\nthe exercise, she was much away from home every day.  Sometimes, attended\nonly by a groom, she rode long distances north or south along the coast;\nor up over the ridge behind the castle and far inland along the shaded\nroads through the woods; or over bleak wind-swept stretches of moorland.\nSometimes she would walk, all alone, far down to the sea-road, and would\nsit for hours on the shore or high up on some little rocky headland where\nshe could enjoy the luxury of solitude.\r\nNow and again in her journeyings she made friends, most of them humble\nones.  She was so great a lady in her station that she could be familiar\nwithout seeming to condescend.  The fishermen of the little ports to\nnorth and south came to know her, and to look gladly for her coming.\nTheir goodwives had for her always a willing curtsy and a ready smile.  As\nfor the children, they looked on her with admiration and love, tempered\nwith awe.  She was so gentle with them, so ready to share their pleasures\r\nand interests, that after a while they came to regard her as some strange\nembodiment of Fairydom and Dreamland.  Many a little heart was made glad\nby the arrival of some item of delight from the Castle; and the hearts of\nthe sick seemed never to hope, or their eyes to look, in vain.\n\nOne friend she made who became very dear and of great import.  Often she\nhad looked up at the old windmill on the crest of the ridge and wondered\nwho inhabited it; for that some one lived in it, or close by, was shown\nat times by the drifting smoke.  One day she made up her mind to go and","see for herself.  She had a fancy not to ask anyone about it.  The place\nwas a little item of mystery; and as such to be treasured and exploited,\nand in due course explored.  The mill itself was picturesque, and the\ndetail at closer acquaintance sustained the far-off impression.  The\nroadway forked on the near side of the mill, reuniting again the further\nside, so that the place made a sort of island--mill, out-offices and\ngarden.  As the mill was on the very top of the ridge the garden which\nlay seawards was sheltered by the building from the west, and from the\r\neast by a thick hedge of thorn and privet, which quite hid it from the\nroadway.  Stephen took the lower road.  Finding no entrance save a locked\nwooden door she followed round to the western side, where the business\nside of the mill had been.  It was all still now and silent, and that it\nhad long fallen into disuse was shown by the grey faded look of\neverything.  Grass, green and luxuriant, grew untrodden between the\ncobble-stones with which the yard was paved.  There was a sort of old-\nworld quietude about everything which greatly appealed to Stephen.\r\nStephen dismounted and walked round the yard admiring everything.  She\ndid not feel as if intruding; for the gateway was wide open.\n\nA low door in the base of the mill tower opened, and a maid appeared, a\ndemure pretty little thing of sixteen or seventeen years, dressed in a\nprim strait dress and an old-fashioned Puritan cap.  Seeing a stranger,\nshe made an ejaculation and drew back hastily.  Stephen called out to\nher:\n\n'Don't be afraid, little girl!  Will you kindly tell me who lives here?'\nThe answer came with some hesitation:\n\n'Sister Ruth.'\r\n'And who is Sister Ruth?'  The question came instinctively and without\npremeditation.  The maid, embarrassed, held hard to the half-open door\nand shifted from foot to foot uneasily.\n\n'I don't know!' she said at last.  'Only Sister Ruth, I suppose!'  It was\nmanifest that the matter had never afforded her anything in the nature of\na problem.  There was an embarrassing silence.  Stephen did not wish to\nseem, or even to be, prying; but her curiosity was aroused.  What manner\nof woman was this who lived so manifestly alone, and who had but a","Christian name!  Stephen, however, had all her life been accustomed to\ndominance, and at Normanstand and Norwood had made many acquaintances\namongst her poorer neighbours.  She was just about to ask if she might\nsee Sister Ruth, when behind the maid in the dark of the low passage-way\nappeared the tall, slim figure of a silver woman.  Truly a silver woman!\nThe first flash of Stephen's thought was correct.  White-haired, white-\nfaced, white-capped, white-kerchiefed; in a plain-cut dress of light-grey\nsilk, without adornment of any kind.  The whole ensemble was as a piece\r\nof old silver.  The lines of her face were very dignified, very sweet,\nvery beautiful.  Stephen felt at once that she was in the presence of no\ncommon woman.  She looked an admiration which all her Quaker garments\ncould not forbid the other to feel.  She was not the first to speak; in\nsuch a noble presence the dignity of Stephen's youth imperatively\ndemanded silence, if not humility.  So she waited.  The Silver Lady, for\nso Stephen ever after held her in her mind, said quietly, but with\nmanifest welcome:\r\n'Didst thou wish to see me?  Wilt thou come in?'  Stephen answered\nfrankly:\n\n'I should like to come in; if you will not think me rude.  The fact is, I\nwas struck when riding by with the beautiful situation of the mill.  I\nthought it was only an old mill till I saw the garden hedges; and I came\nround to ask if I might go in.'  The  Silver Lady came forward at a pace\nthat by itself expressed warmth as she said heartily:\n\n'Indeed thou mayest.  Stay! it is tea-time.  Let us put thy horse in one\nof the sheds; there is no man here at present to do it.  Then thou shalt\r\ncome with me and see my beautiful view!'  She was about to take the horse\nherself, but Stephen forestalled her with a quick: 'No, no! pray let me.\nI am quite accustomed.'  She led the horse to a shed, and having looped\nthe rein over a hook, patted him and ran back.  The Silver Lady gave her\na hand, and they entered the dark passage together.\n\nStephen was thinking if she ought to begin by telling her name.  But the\nHaroun al Raschid feeling for adventure incognito is an innate principle\nof the sons of men.  It was seldom indeed that her life had afforded her","such an opportunity.\n\nThe Silver Lady on her own part also wished for silence, as she looked\nfor the effect on her companion when the glory of the view should break\nupon her.  When they had climbed the winding stone stair, which led up\nsome twenty feet, there was a low wide landing with the remains of the\nmain shaft of the mill machinery running through it.  From one side rose\na stone stair curving with the outer wall of the mill tower and guarded\nby a heavy iron rail.  A dozen steps there were, and then a landing a\r\ncouple of yards square; then a deep doorway cut in the thickness of the\nwall, round which the winding stair continued.\n\nThe Silver Lady, who had led the way, threw open the door, and motioned\nto her guest to enter.  Stephen stood for a few moments, surprised as\nwell as delighted, for the room before her as not like anything which she\nhad ever seen or thought of.\n\nIt was a section of almost the whole tower, and was of considerable size,\nfor the machinery and even the inner shaft had been removed.  East and\nsouth and west the wall had been partially cut away so that great wide\r\nwindows nearly the full height of the room showed the magnificent\npanorama.  In the depths of the ample windows were little cloistered\nnooks where one might with a feeling of super-solitude be away from and\nabove the world.\n\nThe room was beautifully furnished and everywhere were flowers, with\nleaves and sprays and branches where possible.\n\nEven from where she stood in the doorway Stephen had a bird's-eye view of\nthe whole countryside; not only of the coast, with which she was already\nfamiliar, and on which her windows at the Castle looked, but to the south\r\nand west, which the hill rising steep behind the castle and to southward\nshut out.\n\nThe Silver Lady could not but notice her guest's genuine admiration.\n\n'Thou likest my room and my view.  There is no use asking thee, I see\nthou dost!'  Stephen answered with a little gasp.\n\n'I think it is the quaintest and most beautiful place I have ever seen!'\n\n'I am so glad thou likest it.  I have lived here for nearly forty years;\nand they have been years of unutterable peace and earthly happiness!  And\nnow, thou wilt have some tea!'","Stephen left the mill that afternoon with a warmth of heart that she had\nbeen a stranger to for many a day.  The two women had accepted each other\nsimply.  'I am called Ruth,' said the Silver Lady.  'And I am Stephen,'\nsaid the Countess de Lannoy in reply.  And that was all; neither had any\nclue to the other's identity.  Stephen felt that some story lay behind\nthat calm, sweet personality; much sorrow goes to the making of fearless\nquietude.  The Quaker lady moved so little out of her own environment\nthat she did not even suspect the identity of her visitor.  All that she\r\nknew of change was a notice from the solicitor to the estate that, as the\nheadship had lapsed into another branch of the possessing family, she\nmust be prepared, if necessary, to vacate her tenancy, which was one 'at\nwill.'\n\nIt was not long before Stephen availed herself of the permission to come\nagain.  This time she made up her mind to tell who she was, lest the\nconcealment of her identity might lead to awkwardness.  At that meeting\nfriendship became union.\n\nThe natures of the two women expanded to each other; and after a very few\r\nmeetings there was established between them a rare confidence.  Even the\npersonal austerity of Quakerdom, or the state and estate of the peeress,\ncould not come between.  Their friendship seemed to be for the life of\none.  To the other it would be a memory.\n\nThe Silver Lady never left the chosen routine of her own life.  Whatever\nwas the reason of her giving up the world, she kept it to herself; and\nStephen respected her reticence as much as she did her confidence.\n\nIt had become a habit, early in their friendship, for Stephen to ride or\r\nwalk over to the windmill in the dusk of the evening when she felt\nespecially lonely.  On one such occasion she pushed open the outer door,\nwhich was never shut, and took her way up the stone stair.  She knew she\nwould find her friend seated in the window with hands folded on lap,\nlooking out into the silent dusk with that absorbed understanding of\nthings which is holier than reverence, and spiritually more active than\nconscious prayer.\n\nShe tapped the door lightly, and stepped into the room.\n\nWith a glad exclamation, which coming through her habitual sedateness","showed how much she loved the young girl, Sister Ruth started to her\nfeet.  There was something of such truth in the note she had sounded,\nthat the lonely girl's heart went out to her in abandoned fulness.  She\nheld out her arms; and, as she came close to the other, fell rather than\nsank at her feet.  The elder woman recognised, and knew.  She made no\neffort to restrain her; but sinking back into her own seat laid the\ngirl's head in her lap, and held her hands close against her breast.\n\n'Tell me,' she whispered.  'Won't you tell me, dear child, what troubles\r\nyou?  Tell me! dear.  It may bring peace!'\n\n'Oh, I am miserable, miserable, miserable!' moaned Stephen in a low voice\nwhose despair made the other's heart grow cold.  The Silver Lady knew\nthat here golden silence was the best of help; holding close the other's\nhands, she waited.  Stephen's breast began to heave; with an impulsive\nmotion she drew away her hands and put them before her burning face,\nwhich she pressed lower still on the other's lap.  Sister Ruth knew that\nthe trouble, whatever it was, was about to find a voice.  And then came\r\nin a low shuddering whisper a voice muffled in the folds of the dress:\n\n'I killed a man!'\n\nIn all her life the Silver Lady had never been so startled or so shocked.\nShe had grown so to love the bright, brilliant young girl that the\nwhispered confession cut through the silence of the dusk as a shriek of\nmurder goes through the silent gloom of night.  Her hands flew wide from\nher breast, and the convulsive shudder which shook her all in an instant\nwoke Stephen through all her own deep emotion to the instinct of\r\nprotection of the other.  The girl looked up, shaking her head, and said\nwith a sadness which stilled all the other's fear:\n\n'Ah!  Don't be frightened!  It is not murder that I tell you of.  Perhaps\nif it were, the thought would be easier to bear!  He would have been hurt\nless if it had been only his body that I slew.  Well I know now that his\nlife would have been freely given if I wished it; if it had been for my\ngood.  But it was the best of him that I killed; his soul.  His noble,\nloving, trusting, unselfish soul.  The bravest and truest soul that ever","had place in a man's breast! . . . '  Her speaking ended with a sob; her\nbody sank lower.\n\nSister Ruth's heart began to beat more freely.  She understood now, and\nall the womanhood, all the wifehood, motherhood suppressed for a\nlifetime, awoke to the woman's need.  Gently she stroked the beautiful\nhead that lay so meekly on her lap; and as the girl sobbed with but\nlittle appearance of abatement, she said to her softly:\n\n'Tell me, dear child.  Tell me all about it!  See! we are alone together.\nThou and I; and God!  In God's dusk; with only the silent land and sea\r\nbefore us!  Won't thou trust me, dear one, and speak!'\n\nAnd then, as the shadows fell, and far-off lights at sea began to twinkle\nover the waste of waters, Stephen found voice and told without reserve\nthe secret of her shame and her remorse.\n\nAt last, when her broken voice had trailed away into gentle catchings of\nthe breath, the older woman, knowing that the time come for comfort, took\nher in her strong arms, holding her face wet against her own, their tears\nmingling.\n\n'Cry on, dear heart!' she said as she kissed her.  'Cry on!  It will do\r\nthee good!'  She was startled once again as the other seemed for an\ninstant to grow rigid in her arms, and raising her hands cried out in a\nburst of almost hysterical passion:\n\n'Cry! cry!  Oh my God! my God!'  Then becoming conscious of her wet face\nshe seemed to become in an instant all limp, and sank on her knees again.\nThere was so different a note in her voice that the other's heart leaped\nas she heard her say:\n\n'God be thanked for these tears!  Oh, thank God!  Thank God!'  Looking up\nshe saw through the gloom the surprise in her companion's eyes and\r\nanswered their query in words:\n\n'Oh! you don't know!  You can't know what it is to me!  I have not cried\nsince last I saw him pass from me in the wood!'\n\n* * * * *\n\nThat time of confession seemed to have in some way cleared, purified and\nsatisfied Stephen's soul.  Life was now easier to bear.  She was able to\nadapt herself, justifiably to the needs of her position; and all around\nher and dependent on her began to realise that amongst them was a\ncontrolling force, far-reaching sympathy, and a dominant resolution that\nmade for good.","She began to shake off the gloom of her sorrows and to take her place in\nher new high station.  Friends there were in many, and quondam lovers by\nthe score.  Lovers of all sorts.  Fortune-hunters there were be sure, not\na few.  But no need was there for baseness when the lady herself was so\ndesirable; so young, so fair, so lovable.  That she was of great estate\nand 'richly left' made all things possible to any man who had sufficient\nacquisitiveness, or a good conceit of himself.  In a wide circle of\ncountry were many true-lovers who would have done aught to win her\r\npraise.\n\nAnd so in the East the passing of the two years of silence and gloom\nseemed to be the winning of something brighter to follow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX--THE LESSON OF THE WILDERNESS\n\n\nIn the West the two years flew.  Time seemed to go faster there, because\nlife was more strenuous.  Harold, being mainly alone, found endless work\nalways before him.  From daylight to dark labour never ceased; and for\nhis own part he never wished that it should.  In the wilderness, and\nespecially under such conditions as held in Northern Alaska, labour is\r\nnot merely mechanical.  Every hour of the day is fraught with danger in\nsome new form, and the head has to play its part in the strife against\nnature.  In such a life there is not much time for thinking or brooding.\n\nAt first, when the work and his surroundings were strange to him, Harold\ndid many useless things and ran many unnecessary risks.  But his\nknowledge grew with experience.  Privations he had in plenty; and all the\nfibre of his body and the strength of his resolution and endurance were\nnow and again taxed to their utmost.  But with a man of his nature and\r\nrace the breaking strain is high; and endurance and resolution are\nqualities which develop with practice.\n\nGradually his mind came back to normal level; he had won seemingly\nthrough the pain that shadowed him.  Without anguish he could now think,\nremember, look forward.  Then it was that the kindly wisdom of the\nAmerican came back to him, and came to stay.  He began to examine himself\nas to his own part of the unhappy transaction; and stray moments of\nwonderment came as to whether the fault may not, at the very base, have","his own.  He began to realise that it is insufficient in this strenuous\nworld to watch and wait; to suppress one's self; to put aside, in the\nwish to benefit others, all the hopes, ambitions, cravings which make for\npersonal gain.\n\nThus it was that Harold's thoughts, ever circling round Stephen, came\nback with increasing insistence to his duty towards her.  He often\nthought, and with a bitter feeling against himself that it came too late,\nof the dying trust of her father:\n\n'Guard her and cherish her, as if you were indeed my son and she your\r\nsister . . . If it should be that you and Stephen should find that there\nis another affection between you remember I sanction it.  But give her\ntime!  I trust that to you!  She is young, and the world is all before\nher.  Let her choose . . . And be loyal to her, if it is another!  It may\nbe a hard task; but I trust you, Harold!'\n\nHere he would groan, as all the anguish of the past would rush back upon\nhim; and keenest of all would be the fear, suspicion, thought which grew\ntowards belief, that he may have betrayed that trust. . . .\r\nAt first the side of this memory personal to his own happiness was\nfaintly emphasised; the important side was of the duty to Stephen.  But\nas time went on the other thought became a sort of corollary; a timid,\nhalting, blushing thought which followed sheepishly, borne down by\ntrembling hope.  No matter what adventure came to him, the thought of\nneglected duty returned ever afresh.  Once, when he lay sick for weeks in\nan Indian wigwam, the idea so grew with each day of the monotony, that\nwhen he was able to crawl out by himself into the sunshine he had almost\r\nmade up his mind to start back for home.\n\nLuck is a strange thing.  It seems in some mysterious way to be the\ndivine machinery for adjusting averages.  Whatever may be the measure of\nhappiness or unhappiness, good or evil, allotted to anyone, luck is the\ncause or means of counter-balancing so that the main result reaches the\nstandard set.\n\nFrom the time of Harold's illness Dame Fortune seemed to change her\nattitude to him.  The fierce frown, nay! the malignant scowl, to which he\nhad become accustomed, changed to a smile.  Hitherto everything seemed to","have gone wrong with him; but now all at once all seemed to go right.  He\ngrew strong and hardy again.  Indeed, he seemed by contrast to his late\nhelplessness to be so strong and hard that it looked as if that very\nillness had done him good instead of harm.  Game was plentiful, and he\nnever seemed to want.  Everywhere he went there were traces of gold, as\nthough by some instinct he was tracking it to its home.  He did not value\ngold for its own sake; but he did for the ardour of the search.  Harold\nwas essentially a man, and as a man an adventurer.  To such a man of such\r\na race adventure is the very salt of existence.\n\nThe adventurer's instinct took with it the adventurer's judgment; Harold\nwas not content with small results.  Amidst the vast primeval forces\nthere were, he felt, vast results of their prehistoric working; and he\ndetermined to find some of them.  In such a quest, purpose is much.  It\nwas hardly any wonder, then, that in time Harold found himself alone in\nthe midst of one of the great treasure-places of the world.  Only labour\nwas needed to take from the earth riches beyond the dreams of avarice.\r\nBut that labour was no easy problem; great and difficult distance had to\nbe overcome; secrecy must be observed, for even a whisper of the\nexistence of such a place would bring a horde of desperadoes.  But all\nthese difficulties were at least sources of interest, if not in\nthemselves pleasures.  The new Harold, seemingly freshly created by a\nyear of danger and strenuous toil, of self-examining and humiliation, of\nthe realisation of duty, and--though he knew it not as yet--of the\ndawning of hope, found delight in the thought of dangers and difficulties\r\nto be overcome.  Having taken his bearings exactly so as to be safe in\nfinding the place again, he took his specimens with him and set out to\nfind the shortest and best route to the nearest port.\n\nAt length he came to the port and set quietly about finding men.  This he\ndid very carefully and very systematically.  Finally, with the full\ncomplement, and with ample supply of stores, he started on his expedition\nto the new goldfields.\n\nIt is not purposed to set out here the extraordinary growth of Robinson\nCity, for thus the mining camp soon became.  Its history has long ago","been told for all the world.  In the early days, when everything had to\nbe organised and protected, Harold worked like a giant, and with a system\nand energy which from the first established him as a master.  But when\nthe second year of his exile was coming to a close, and Robinson City was\nteeming with life and commerce, when banks and police and soldiers made\nlife and property comparatively safe, he began to be restless again.  This\nwas not the life to which he had set himself.  He had gone into the\nwilderness to be away from cities and from men; and here a city had\r\nsprung up around him and men claimed him as their chief.  Moreover, with\nthe restless feeling there began to come back to him the old thoughts and\nthe old pain.\n\nBut he felt strong enough by this time to look forward in life as well as\nbackward.  With him now to think was to act; so much at least he had\ngained from his position of dominance in an upspringing city.  He quietly\nconsolidated such outlying interests as he had, placed the management of\nhis great estate in the hands of a man he had learned to trust, and\r\ngiving out that he was going to San Francisco to arrange some business,\nleft Robinson City.  He had already accumulated such a fortune that the\nworld was before him in any way he might choose to take.\n\nKnowing that at San Francisco, to which he had booked, he would have to\nrun the gauntlet of certain of his friends and business connections, he\nmade haste to leave the ship quietly at Portland, the first point she\ntouched on her southern journey.  Thence he got on the Canadian Pacific\nLine and took his way to Montreal.\r\nWhat most arrested his attention, and in a very disconcerting way, were\nthe glimpses of English life one sees reproduced so faithfully here and\nthere in Canada.  The whole of the past rushed back on him so\noverpoweringly that he was for the moment unnerved.  The acute feeling of\ncourse soon became mitigated; but it was the beginning of a\nre-realisation of what had been, and which grew stronger with each mile\nas the train swept back eastward.\n\nAt first he tried to fight it; tried with all the resources of his strong\nnature.  His mind was made up, he assured himself over and over again.","The past was past, and what had been was no more to him than to any of\nthe other passengers of the train.  Destiny had long ago fulfilled\nitself.  Stephen no doubt had by now found some one worthy of her and had\nmarried.  In no dream, sleeping or waking, could he ever admit that she\nhad married Leonard; that was the only gleam of comfort in what had grown\nto be remorse for his neglected duty.\n\nAnd so it was that Harold An Wolf slowly drifted, though he knew it not,\ninto something of the same intellectual position which had dominated him\r\nwhen he had started on his journeying and the sunset fell nightly on his\ndespairing face.  The life in the wilderness, and then in the dominance\nand masterdom of enterprise, had hardened and strengthened him into more\nself-reliant manhood, giving him greater forbearance and a more practical\nview of things.\n\nWhen he took ship in the _Dominion_, a large cargo-boat with some\npassengers running to London, he had a vague purpose of visiting in\nsecret Norcester, whence he could manage to find out how matters were at\nNormanstand.  He would then, he felt, be in a better position to regulate\r\nhis further movements.  He knew that he had already a sufficient disguise\nin his great beard.  He had nothing to fear from the tracing of him on\nhis journey from Alaska or the interest of his fellow-passengers.  He had\nall along been so fortunate as to be able to keep his identity concealed.\nThe name John Robinson told nothing in itself, and the width of a whole\ngreat continent lay between him and the place of his fame.  He was able\nto take his part freely amongst both the passengers and the officers.\nEven amongst the crew he soon came to be known; the men liked his\r\ngeniality, and instinctively respected his enormous strength and his\nmanifest force of character.  Men who work and who know danger soon learn\nto recognise the forces which overcome both.  And as sufficient time had\nnot elapsed to impair his hardihood or lower his vast strength he was\nfacile princeps.  And so the crew acknowledged him; to them he was a born\nCaptain whom to obey would be a natural duty.\n\nAfter some days the weather changed.  The great ship, which usually\nrested even-keeled on two waves, and whose bilge keels under normal","conditions rendered rolling impossible, began to pitch and roll like a\nleviathan at play.  The decks, swept by gigantic seas, were injured\nwherever was anything to injure. Bulwarks were torn away as though they\nhad been compact of paper.  More than once the double doors at the head\nof the companion stairs had been driven in.  The bull's eye glasses of\nsome of the ports were beaten from their brazen sockets.  Nearly all the\nboats had been wrecked, broken or torn from their cranes as the great\r\nship rolled heavily in the trough, or giant waves had struck her till she\nquivered like a frightened horse.\n\nAt that season she sailed on the far northern course.  Driven still\nfarther north by the gales, she came within a short way of south of\nGreenland.  Then avoiding Moville, which should have been her place of\ncall, she ran down the east of Britain, the wild weather still\nprevailing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI--THE LIFE-LINE\n\n\nOn the coast of Angleshire the weather in the early days of September had\nbeen stormy.  With the south-west wind had come deluges of rain, not a\r\ncommon thing for the time of year on the east coast.  Stephen, whose\nspirits always rose with high wind, was in a condition of prolonged\nexcitement.  She could not keep still; every day she rode long distances,\nand found a wonderful satisfaction in facing the strong winds.  Like a\ntrue horsewoman she did not mind the wet, and had glorious gallops over\nthe grassy ridge and down the slopes on the farther side, out on the open\nroad or through the endless grass rides amid the pine woods.\n\nOn the Tuesday morning the storm was in full sweep, and Stephen was in\r\nwild spirits.  Nothing would do her but to go out on the tower of the\ncastle where she could walk about, and leaning on the crenellated parapet\nlook over all the coast stretching far in front and sweeping away to the\nleft and right.  The prospect so enchanted her, and the fierce sweep of\nthe wind so suited her exalted mood, that she remained there all the\nmorning.  The whole coast was a mass of leaping foam and flying spray,\nand far away to the horizon white-topped waves rolled endlessly.  That\nday she did not even ride out, but contented herself with watching the","sea and the storm from the tower.  After lunch she went to her tower\nagain; and again after tea.  The storm was now furious.  She made up her\nmind that after dinner she would ride down and see its happenings close\nat hand.\n\nWhen she had finished dinner she went to her room to dress for her ride.\nThe rush and roar of the storm were in her ears, and she was in wild\ntumultuous spirits.  All her youth seemed to sweep back on her; or\nperhaps it was that the sickness of the last two years was swept away.\nSomewhere deep down in Stephen's heart, below her intention or even her\r\nconsciousness, was a desire to be her old self if only for an hour.  And\nto this end externals were of help.  Without weighing the matter in her\nmind, and acting entirely on impulse, she told her maid to get the red\nhabit she had not worn for years.  When she was dressed she sent round to\nhave out her white Arab; while it was getting ready she went once more to\nthe tower to see the storm-effect in the darkening twilight.  As she\nlooked, her heart for an instant stood still.  Half-way to the horizon a\ngreat ship, ablaze in the bows, was driving through the waves with all\r\nher speed.  She was heading towards the little port, beyond which the\nshallows sent up a moving wall of white spray.\n\nStephen tore down the turret stair, and gave hurried directions to have\nbeds prepared in a number of rooms, fires everywhere, and plenty of\nprovisions.  She also ordered that carriages should be sent at once to\nthe fishing port with clothing and restoratives.  There would, she felt,\nbe need for such help before a time to be measured by minutes should have\npassed; and as some of her servants were as yet strange to her ways she\r\ndid not leave anything to chance.  One carriage was to go for the doctor\nwho lived at Lannoy, the village over the hill, whence nothing could be\nseen of what was happening.  She knew that others within sight or hailing\nwould be already on their way.  Work was afoot, and had she time, or\nthought of it, she would have chosen a more sedate garb.  But in the\nexcitement no thought of herself came to her.\n\nIn a few seconds she was in the saddle, tearing at full speed down the\nroad that led to the port.  The wind was blowing so strongly in her face","that only in the lulls could she hear the hoof-strokes of the groom's\nhorse galloping behind her.\n\nAt first the height of the road allowed her to see the ship and the port\ntowards which she was making.  But presently the road dipped, and the\ncurving of the hill shut both from her sight; it was only when she came\nclose that she could see either again.\n\nNow the great ship was close at hand.  The flames had gained terribly,\nand it was a race for life or death.  There was no time do more than run\nher aground if life was to be saved at all.  The captain, who in the gaps\r\nof the smoke could be seen upon the bridge, knew his work well.  As he\ncame near the shoal he ran a little north, and then turned sharply so as\nto throw the boat's head to the south of the shoal.  Thus the wind would\ndrive fire and smoke forward and leave the after part of the vessel free\nfor a time.\n\nThe shock of her striking the sand was terrific, though the tinkle of the\nbell borne in on the gale showed that the engines had been slowed down.\nThe funnels were shaken down, and the masts broke off, falling forward.  A\r\nwild shriek from a hundred throats cleft the roaring of wind and wave.\nThe mast fell, the foremast, with all its cumbering top-hamper on the\nbridge, which was in an instant blotted out of existence, together with\nthe little band of gallant men who stood on it, true to their last duty.\nAs the wind took the smoke south a man was seen to climb on the wreck of\nthe mast aft and make fast the end of a great coil of rope which he\ncarried.  He was a huge man with a full dark beard.  Two sailors working\nwith furious haste helped him with the rope.  The waves kept raising the\r\nship a little, each time bumping her on the sand with a shock.  The\npeople on deck held frantically to the wreckage around them.\n\nThen the bearded man, stripping to his waist and cutting off his trousers\nabove the knee, fastened an end of the rope round his waist.  The sailors\nstood ready one behind the other to pay it out.  As a great wave rolled\nunder the ship, he threw himself into the sea.\n\nIn the meantime the coastguard had fixed Board of Trade rocket-apparatus,\nand in a few seconds the prolonged roar of a rocket was heard.  It flew","straight towards the ship, rising at a high angle so as to fall beyond\nit.  But the force of the wind took it up as it rose, and the gale\nincreased so that it rose nearly vertically; and in this position the\nwind threw it south of its objective, and short of it.  Another rocket\nwas got ready at once, and blue lights were burned so that the course of\nthe venturous swimmer might be noted.  He swam strongly; but the great\nweight of the rope behind kept pulling him back, and the southern trend\r\nof the tide current and the force of the wind kept dragging him from the\npier.  Within the bar the waves were much less than without; but they\nwere still so unruly that no boat in the harbour--which was not a\nlifeboat station--could venture out.  Indeed, in the teeth of the storm\nit would have been a physical impossibility to have driven one seaward.\n\nAs the gathered crowd saw Stephen approach they made way for her.  She\nhad left her horse with the groom, and despite the drenching spray fought\na way against the wind out on the pier.  As in the glare of the blue\r\nlight, which brought many things into harsh unnatural perspective, she\ncaught sight of the set face of the swimmer rising and falling with the\nwaves, her heart leaped.  This was indeed a man! a brave man; and all the\nwoman in her went out to him.  For him, and to aid him and his work, she\nwould have given everything, done anything; and in her heart, which beat\nin an ecstasy of anxiety, she prayed with that desperate conviction of\nhope which comes in such moments of exaltation.\n\nBut it soon became apparent that no landing could be effected.  The force\r\nof the current and the wind were taking the man too far southward for him\never to win a way back.  Then one of coastguards took the lead-topped\ncane which they use for throwing practice, and, after carefully coiling\nthe line attached it so that it would run free, managed with a desperate\neffort to fling it far out.  The swimmer, to whom it fell close, fought\ntowards it frantically; and as the cord began to run through the water,\nmanaged to grasp it.  A wild cheer rose from the shore and the ship.  A\nstout line was fastened to the shore end of the cord, and the swimmer","drew it out to him.  He bent it on the rope which trailed behind him;\nthen, seeing that he was himself a drag on it, with the knife which he\ndrew from the sheath at the back of his waist, he cut himself free.  One\nof the coastguards on the pier, helped by a host of willing hands, began\ndrawing the end of the rope on shore.  The swimmer still held the line\nthrown to him, and several men on the pier began to draw on it.  Unhappily\nthe thin cord broke under the strain, and within a few seconds the\nswimmer had drifted out of possible help.  Seeing that only wild rocks\r\nlay south of the sea-wall, and that on them seas beat furiously, he\nturned and made out for sea.  In the light beyond the glare he could see\nvaguely the shore bending away to the west in a deep curve of unbroken\nwhite leaping foam.  There was no hope of landing there.  To the south\nwas the headland, perhaps two miles away as the crow flies.  Here was the\nonly chance for him.  If he could round the headland, he might find\nshelter beyond; or somewhere along the farther shore some opening might\npresent itself.  Whilst the light from the blue fires still reached him\r\nhe turned and made for the headland.\n\nIn the meantime on ship and on shore men worked desperately.  Before long\nthe end of the hawser was carried round on the high cliff, and pulled as\ntaut as the force at hand could manage, and made fast.  Soon endless\nropes were bringing in passengers and crew as fast as place could be\nfound for them.  It became simply a race for time.  If the fire, working\nagainst the wind, did not reach the hawser, and if the ship lasted the\nfurious bumping on the sandbank, which threatened to shake her to pieces\r\neach moment, all on board might yet be saved.\n\nStephen's concern was now for the swimmer alone.  Such a gallant soul\nshould not perish without help, if help could be on this side of heaven.\nShe asked the harbour-master, an old fisherman who knew every inch of the\ncoast for miles, if anything could be done.  He shook his head sadly as\nhe answered:\n\n'I fear no, my lady.  The lifeboat from Granport is up north, no boat\nfrom here could get outside the harbour.  There's never a spot in the bay\nwhere he could land, even in a less troubled sea than this.  Wi' the wind","ashore, there's no hope for ship or man here that cannot round the point.\nAnd a stranger is no like to do that.'\n\n'Why not?' she asked breathlessly.\n\n'Because, my lady, there's a wheen o' sunken rocks beyond the Head.  No\none that didn't know would ever think to keep out beyond them, for the\ncliff itself goes down sheer.  He's a gallant soul yon; an' it's a sore\npity he's goin' to his death.  But it must be!  God can save him if He\nwishes; but I fear none other!'\n\nEven as he spoke rose to Stephen's mind a memory of an old churchyard\r\nwith great trees and the scent of many flowers, and a child's voice that\nsounded harsh through the monotonous hum of bees:\n\n'To be God, and able to do things!'\n\nOh; to be God, if but an hour; and able to do things!  To do anything to\nhelp a brave man!  A wild prayer surged up in the girl's heart:\n\n'Oh! God, give me this man's life!  Give it to me to atone for the other\nI destroyed!  Let me but help him, and do with me as Thou wilt!'\n\nThe passion of her prayer seemed to help her, and her brain cleared.\nSurely something could be done!  She would do what she could; but first\r\nshe must understand the situation.  She turned again to the old harbour-\nmaster:\n\n'How long would it take him to reach the headland, if he can swim so\nfar?'  The answer came with a settled conviction bearing hope with it:\n\n'The wind and tide are wi' him, an' he's a strong swimmer.  Perhaps half\nan hour will take him there.  He's all right in himself.  He can swim it,\nsure.  But alack! it's when he gets there his trouble will be, when none\ncan warn him.  Look how the waves are lashing the cliff; and mark the\r\nwhite water beyond!  What voice can sound to him out in those deeps?  How\ncould he see if even one were there to warn?'\n\nHere was a hope at any rate.  Light and sound were the factors of safety.\nSome good might be effected if she could get a trumpet; and there were\ntrumpets in the rocket-cart.  Light could be had--must be had if all the\nfences round the headland had to be gathered for a bonfire!  There was\nnot a moment to be lost.  She ran to the rocket-cart, and got a trumpet\nfrom the man in charge.  Then she ran to where she had left her horse.","She had plenty of escort, for by this time many gentlemen had arrived on\nhorseback from outlying distances, and all offered their services.  She\nthanked them and said:\n\n'You may be useful here.  When all these are ashore send on the rocket-\ncart, and come yourselves to the headland as quick as you can.  Tell the\ncoastguards that all those saved are to be taken to the castle.  In the\nrocket-cart bring pitch and tar and oil, and anything that will flame.\nStay!' she cried to the chief boatman.  'Give me some blue lights!'  His\r\nanswer chilled her:\n\n'I'm sorry, my lady, but they are all used.  There are the last of them\nburning now.  We have burned them ever since that man began to swim\nashore.'\n\n'Then hurry on the rocket-cart!' she said as she sprang to the saddle,\nand swept out on the rough track that ran by the cliffs, following in\nbold curves the windings of the shore.  The white Arab seemed to know\nthat his speed was making for life.  As he swept along, far outdistancing\nthe groom, Stephen's heart went out in silent words which seemed to keep\ntime to the gallop:\r\n'Oh, to be God, and be able to do things!  Give me this man's life, oh,\nGod!  Give me this man's life, to atone for that noble one which I\ndestroyed!'\n\nFaster and faster, over rough road, cattle track, and grassy sward; over\nrising and falling ground; now and again so close to the edge of the high\ncliff that the spume swept up the gulleys in the rocks like a snowstorm,\nthe white Arab swept round the curve of the bay, and came out on the high\nheadland where stood the fisher's house.  On the very brink of the cliff\nall the fisher folk, men, women and children, stood looking at the far-\r\noff burning ship, from which the flames rose in leaping columns.\n\nSo intent were all on the cliff that they did not notice her coming; as\nthe roar of the wind came from them to her, they could not hear her voice\nwhen she spoke from a distance.  She had drawn quite close, having\ndismounted and hung her rein over the post of the garden paling, when one\nof the children saw her, and cried out:\n\n'The lady! the lady! an' she's all in red!'  The men were so intent on\nsomething that they did not seem to hear.  They were peering out to the","north, and were arguing in dumb show as though on something regarding\nwhich they did not agree.  She drew closer, and touching the old\nfisherman on the shoulder, called out at his ear:\n\n'What is it?'  He answered without turning, keeping his eyes fixed:\n\n'_I_ say it's a man swimmin'.  Joe and Garge here say as it's only a\npiece o' wood or sea-wrack.  But I know I'm right.  That's a man\nswimmin', or my old eyes have lost their power!'  His words carried\nconviction; the seed of hope in her beating heart grew on the instant\ninto certainty.\r\n'It _is_ a man.  I saw him swim off towards here when he had taken the\nrope on shore.  Do not turn round.  Keep your eyes on him so that you may\nnot lose sight of him in the darkness!'  The old man chuckled.\n\n'This darkness!  Hee! hee!  There be no differ to me between light and\ndark.  But I'll watch him!  It's you, my lady!  I shan't turn round to do\nmy reverence as you tell me to watch.  But, poor soul, it'll not be for\nlong to watch.  The Skyres will have him, sure enow!'\n\n'We can warn him!' she said, 'when he comes close enough.  I have a\r\ntrumpet here!'  He shook his head sorrowfully:\n\n'Ah! my lady, what trumpet could sound against that storm an' from this\nheight?'  Stephen's heart sank.  But there was still hope.  If the\nswimmer's ears could not be reached, his eyes might.  Eagerly she looked\nback for the coming of the rocket-cart.  Far off across the deep bay she\ncould see its lamp sway as it passed over the rough ground; but alas! it\nwould never arrive in time.  With a note of despair in her voice she\nasked:\n\n'How long before he reaches the rocks?'  Still without turning the old\nman answered:\r\n'At the rate he's going he will be in the sweep of the current through\nthe rocks within three minutes.  If he's to be saved he must turn seaward\nere the stream grips him.'\n\n'Would there be time to build a bonfire?'\n\n'No, no! my lady.  The wood couldn't catch in the time!'\n\nFor an instant a black film of despair seemed to fall on her.  The\nsurging of the blood in her head made her dizzy, and once again the\nprayer of the old memory rang in her brain:\n\n'Oh to be God, and able to do things!'\n\nOn the instant an inspiration flashed through her.  She, too could do","things in a humble way.  She could do something at any rate.  If there\nwas no time to build a fire, there was a fire already built.\n\nThe house would burn!\n\nThe two feet deep of old thatch held down with nets and battened with\nwreck timber would flare like a beacon.  Forthwith she spoke:\n\n'Good people, this noble man who has saved a whole shipload of others\nmust not die without an effort.  There must be light so that he can see\nour warning to pass beyond the rocks!  The only light can be from the\nhouse.  I buy it of you.  It is mine; but I shall pay you for it and\r\nbuild you such another as you never thought of.  But it must be fired at\nonce.  You have one minute to clear out all you want.  In, quick and take\nall can.  Quick! quick! for God's sake!  It is for a brave man's life!'\n\nThe men and women without a word rushed into the house.  They too knew\nthe danger, and the only hope there was for a life.  The assurance of the\nCountess took the sting from the present loss.  Before the minute, which\nshe timed watch in hand, was over, all came forth bearing armloads of\r\ntheir lares and penates.  Then one of the younger men ran in again and\nout bearing a flaming stick from the fire.  Stephen nodded, he held it to\nthe northern edge of the thatch.  The straw caught in a flash and the\nflame ran up the slope and along the edge of the roof like a quick match.\nThe squeaking of many rats was heard and their brown bodies streamed over\nthe roof.  Before another minute had passed a great mass of flame towered\ninto the sky and shed a red light far out over the waste of sea.\n\nIt lit up the wilderness of white water where the sea churned savagely\r\namongst the sunken rocks; and it lit too the white face of a swimmer, now\nnearly spent, who rising and falling with each wave, drifted in the sea\nwhose current bore him on towards the fatal rocks.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII--'TO BE GOD AND ABLE TO DO THINGS'\n\n\nWhen the swimmer saw the light he looked up; even at the distance they\ncould see the lift of his face; but he did not seem to realise that there\nwas any intention in the lighting, or that it was created for his\nbenefit.  He was manifestly spent with his tremendous exertions, and with","his long heavy swim in the turbulent sea.  Stephen's heart went out to\nhim in a wave of infinite pity.  She tried to use the trumpet.  But\nsimple as it is, a trumpet needs skill or at least practice in its use;\nshe could only make an unintelligible sound, and not much even of that.\nOne of the young men said:\n\n'Let me try it, my lady!'  She handed him the trumpet and he in turn used\nwith a will.  But it was of no avail; even his strong lungs and lusty\nmanhood availed nothing in the teeth of that furious gale.  The roof and\r\nthe whole house was now well alight, and the flame roared and leapt.\nStephen began to make gestures bidding the swimmer, in case he might see\nher and understand, move round the rocks.  But he made no change in his\ndirection, and was fast approaching a point in the tide-race whence to\navoid the sunken rocks would be an impossibility.  The old whaler,\naccustomed to use all his wits in times of difficulty, said suddenly:\n\n'How can he understand when we're all between him and the light.  We are\nonly black shadows to him; all he can see are waving arms!'  His sons\r\ncaught his meaning and were already dashing towards the burning house.\nThey came back with piles of blazing wood and threw them down on the very\nedge of the cliff; brought more and piled them up, flinging heaps of\nstraw on the bonfire and pouring on oil and pitch till the flames rose\nhigh.  Stephen saw what was necessary and stood out of the way, but close\nto the old whaler, where the light fell on both of their faces as they\nlooked in the direction of the swimmer.  Stephen's red dress itself stood\nout like a flame.  The gale tearing up the front of the cliff had whirled\r\naway her hat; in the stress of the wind her hair was torn from its up-\npinning and flew wide, itself like leaping flame.\n\nHer gestures as she swept her right arm round, as though demonstrating\nthe outward curve of a circle, or raising the hand above her head\nmotioned with wide palm and spread fingers 'back! back!' seemed to have\nreached the swimmer's intelligence.  He half rose in the water and looked\nabout.  As if seeing something that he realised, he sank back again and\nbegan swim frantically out to sea.  A great throb of joy made Stephen","almost faint.  At last she had been able to do something to help this\ngallant man.  In half a minute his efforts seemed to tell in his race for\nlife.  He drew sufficiently far from dangerous current for there to be a\nhope that he might be saved if he could last out the stress to come.\n\nThe fishermen kept watch in silent eagerness; and in their presence\nStephen felt a comfort, though, like her, they could do nothing at\npresent.\n\nWhen the swimmer had passed sufficiently far out to be clear of the\nrocks, the fire began to lose its flame, though not its intensity.  It\r\nwould be fiery still for hours to come, and of great heat; but the flames\nceased to leap, and in the moderated light Stephen only saw the white\nface for one more instant ere it faded out of her ken, when, turning, the\nman looked towards the light and made a gesture which she did not\nunderstand: for he put for an instant both hands before his face.\n\nJust then there was a wild noise on the cliff.  The rocket-cart drawn by\nsixteen splendid horses, some of them hunters, came tearing up the slope,\nand with it many men on horseback afoot.  Many of the runners were the\r\ngentlemen who had given their horses for the good work.\n\nAs the coastguards jumped from the cart, and began to get out the rocket\nstand, the old whaler pointed out the direction where the swimmer's head\ncould still be seen.  Some of the sailors could see it too; though to\nStephen and the laymen it was invisible.  The chief boatman shook his\nhead:\n\n'No use throwing a line there!  Even if he got it we could never drag him\nalive through these rocks.  He would be pounded to death before twenty\nfathom!'  Stephen's heart grew cold as she listened.  Was this the end?\r\nThen with a bitter cry she wailed:\n\n'Oh! can nothing be done?  Can nothing be done?  Can no boat come from\nthe other side of the point?  Must such a brave man be lost!' and her\ntears began to flow.\n\nOne of the young men who had just arrived, a neighbouring squire, a\nproved wastrel but a fine horseman, who had already regarded Stephen at\nthe few occasions of their meeting with eyes of manifest admiration,\nspoke up:\n\n'Don't cry, Lady de Lannoy.  There's a chance for him yet.  I'll see what\nI can do.'","'Bless you! oh! bless you!' she cried impulsively as she caught his hand.\nThen came the chill of doubt.  'But what can you do?' she added\ndespairingly.\n\n'Hector and I may be able to do something together.'  Turning to one of\nthe fishermen he asked:\n\n'Is there any way down to the water in the shelter of the point?'\n\n'Ay! ay! sir,' came the ready answer.  'There's the path as we get down\nby to our boats.'\n\n'Come on, then!' he said.  'Some of you chaps show us a light on the way\ndown.  If Hector can manage the scramble there's a chance.  You see,' he\r\nsaid, turning again to Stephen, 'Hector can swim like a fish.  When he\nwas a racer I trained him in the sea so that none of the touts could spy\nout his form.  Many's the swim we've had together; and in rough water\ntoo, though in none so wild as this!'\n\n'But it is a desperate chance for you!' said Stephen, woman-like drawing\nsomewhat back from a danger she had herself evoked.  The young man\nlaughed lightly:\n\n'What of that!  I may do one good thing before I die.  That fine fellow's\nlife is worth a hundred of my wasted one!  Here! some of you fellows help\r\nme with Hector.  We must take him from the cart and get a girth on him\ninstead of the saddle.  We shall want something to hold on to without\npulling his head down by using the bridle.'\n\nHe, followed by some others, ran to the rocket-cart where the horses\nstood panting, their steam rising in a white cloud in the glow of the\nburning house.  In an incredibly short time the horse was ready with only\nthe girth.  The young squire took him by the mane and he followed\neagerly; he had memories of his own.  As they passed close to Stephen the\r\nsquire said to one of his friends:\n\n'Hold him a minute, Jack!'  He ran over to Stephen and looked at her\nhard:\n\n'Good-bye!  Wish me luck; and give us light!'  Tears were in her eyes and\na flush on her cheek as she took his hand and clasped it hard:\n\n'Oh, you brave man!  God bless you!'  He stooped suddenly and impulsively\nkissed the back of her hand lightly and was gone.  For a fleeting moment\nshe was angry.  No man had kissed her hand before; but the thought of his\nliberty was swept away by another:\n\n'Little enough when he may be going to his death!'","It was a sight to see that man and horse, surrounded by an eager crowd of\nhelpers, scrambling down the rough zigzag, cut and worn in the very face\nof the cliff.  They stumbled, and slipped; pebbles and broken rock fell\naway under their feet.  Alone close to the bonfire stood Stephen,\nfollowing every movement with racing blood and beating heart.  The\nbonfire was glowing; a constant stream of men and women were dragging and\nhauling all sorts of material for its increase.  The head of the swimmer\ncould be seen, rising and falling amid the waves beyond the Skyres.\r\nWhen about twenty feet from the water-level the path jutted out to one\nside left of the little beach whereon the sea now broke fiercely.  This\nwas a place where men watched, and whence at times they fished with rods;\nthe broad rock overhung the water.  The fire above, though it threw\nshadows, made light enough for everything.  The squire held up his hand.\n\n'Stop!  We can take off this rock, if the water is deep enough.  How much\nis it?'\n\n'Ten fathoms sheer.'\n\n'Good!'  He motioned to them all to keep back.  Then threw off all his\r\nclothes except shirt and trousers.  For an instant he patted Hector and\nthen sprang upon his back.  Holding him by the mane he urged him forward\nwith a cry.  The noble animal did not hesitate an instant.  He knew that\ngrasp of the mane; that cry; that dig of the spurless heels.  He sprang\nforward with wide dilated nostrils, and from the edge of the jutting rock\njumped far out into the sea.  Man and horse disappeared for a few\nseconds, but rose safely.  The man slid from the horse's back; and,\nholding by the girth with one hand, swam beside him out to sea in the\r\ndirection the swimmer must come on rounding the sunken rocks.\n\nA wild cheer broke from all on the cliff above and those already\nscrambling back up the zigzag.  Stephen kept encouraging the men to bring\nfuel to the bonfire:\n\n'Bring everything you can find; the carts, the palings, the roofs, the\ncorn, the dried fish; anything and everything that will burn.  We must\nhave light; plenty of light!  Two brave men's lives are at stake now!'\n\nThe whole place was a scene of activity.  Stephen stood on the edge of\nthe cliff with the old whaler and the chief boatman and some of the","women.  The rest of the coastguards were by orders of their chief rigging\nup a whip which they thought might be necessary to hoist the men up from\nthe water, if they could ever get close enough.  One of the young men who\nhad ridden with the rocket-cart kept tight hold of Hector's bridle; he\nknew it would be wanted if the horse ever had a chance of landing.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen Harold turned away from the dazzling blue lights on the pier, and\nsaw the far white line of the cliffs beyond the bay, his heart sank\r\nwithin him.  Even his great strength and hardihood, won by work and\nprivation in the far North-West, had been already taxed in the many days\nof the battling with the gale when all on board who could lend a hand\nwere taken into service.  Again by the frantic struggle of the last hour\nor two, when the ship ran shoreward at the utmost of her speed in the\nlast hope of beaching in time to save life.  Finally in that grim\nstruggle to draw the life-line shoreward.  The cold and then the great\nheat, and on top of it the chill of the long swim, seemed to have struck\r\nat him.  Alone on the dark sea, for soon the current and his own\nexertions were taking him away from the rocks, the light of the burning\nship was ceasing to be effective.  It was just enough to hinder his\nvision; looking from the patch of light which bathed the light and him he\ncould just see far off the white water which marked the cliff fronts, and\non the edge of his horizon the grim moving white wall where the waves\nbroke on the headland.\n\nOn and on he toiled.  His limbs were becoming more cramped with the cold\nand the terrible strain of swimming in such waves.  But still the brave\r\nheart bore him up; and resolutely, sternly he forced himself afresh to\nthe effort before him.  He reasoned that where there was such a headland\nstanding out so stark into the sea there ought to be some shelter in its\nlee.  If he could pass it he might find calmer water and even a landing-\nplace beyond.\n\nHere at least was hope.  He would try to round the point at any rate.  Now\nhe drew so close that the great rocks seemed to tower vast above him.  He\nwas not yet close enough to feel as though lapped in their shadow; but","even the overcast sky seemed full of light above the line of the cliff.\nThere was a strange roaring, rushing sound around him.  He thought that\nit was not merely the waves dashing on the rocks, but that partly it came\nfrom his own ears; that his ebbing strength was feeling the frantic\nstruggle which he was making.  The end was coming, he thought; but still\nhe kept valiantly on, set and silent, as is the way with brave men.\n\nSuddenly from the top of the cliff a bright light flashed.  He looked at\nit sideways as he fought his way on, and saw the light rise and fall and\r\nflicker as the flames leaped.  High over him he saw fantastic figures\nwhich seemed to dance on the edge of the high cliff.  They had evidently\nnoticed him, and were making signals of some sort; but what the motions\nwere he could not see or understand, for they were but dark silhouettes,\nedged with light, against the background of fire.  The only thing he\ncould think was that they meant to encourage him, and so he urged himself\nto further effort.  It might be that help was at hand!\n\nSeveral times as he turned his head sideways he saw the figures and the\r\nlight, but not so clearly; it was as though the light was lessening in\npower.  When again he looked he saw a new fire leap out on the edge of\nthe cliff, and some figures to the right of it.  They were signalling in\nsome way.  So, pausing in his swimming, he rose a little from the water\nand looked at them.\n\nA thrill shot through him, and a paralysing thought that he must have\ngone mad.  With his wet hand he cleared his eyes, though the touching\nthem pained him terribly, and for an instant saw clearly:\n\nThere on the edge of the cliff, standing beside some men and waving her\r\narms in a wild sweep as though motioning frantically 'Keep out! keep\nout!' was a woman.  Instinctively he glanced to his left and saw a white\nwaste of leaping water, through which sharp rocks rose like monstrous\nteeth.  On the instant he saw the danger, and made out seaward, swimming\nfrantically to clear the dangerous spot before the current would sweep\nhim upon the rocks.\n\nBut the woman!  As one remembers the last sight when the lightning has\nbanished sight, so that vision seemed burned into his brain.  A woman","with a scarlet riding-habit and masses of long red hair blowing in the\ngale like leaping flame!  Could there be two such persons in the world?\nNo! no!  It was a vision!  A vision of the woman he loved, come to save\nhim in the direst moment of great peril!\n\nHis heart beat with new hope; only the blackness of the stormy sea was\nbefore him as he strove frantically on.\n\nPresently when he felt the current slacken, for he had been swimming\nacross it and could feel its power, he turned and looked back.  As he did\nso he murmured aloud:\r\n'A dream!  A vision!  She came to warn me!'  For as he looked all had\ndisappeared.  Cliff and coastline, dark rocks and leaping seas, blazing\nfire, and the warning vision of the woman he loved.\n\nAgain he looked where the waste of sea churning amongst the sunken rocks\nhad been.  He could hear the roaring of waters, the thunder of great\nwaves beating on the iron-bound coast; but nothing could he see.  He was\nalone on the wild sea; in the dark.\n\nThen truly the swift shadow of despair fell upon him.\n\n'Blind  Blind!' he moaned, and for the moment, stricken with despair,\r\nsank into the trough of the waves.  But the instinctive desire for life\nrecalled him.  Once more he fought his way up to the surface, and swam\nblindly, desperately on.  Seeing nothing, he did not know which way he\nwas going.  He might have heard better had his eyes been able to help his\nears; but in the sudden strange darkness all the senses were astray.  In\nthe agony of his mind he could not even feel the pain of his burnt face;\nthe torture of his eyes had passed.  But with the instinct of a strong\nman he kept on swimming blindly, desperately.\r\n* * * * *\n\nIt seemed as if ages of untold agony had gone by, when he heard a voice\nseemingly beside him:\n\n'Lay hold here!  Catch the girth!'  The voice came muffled by wind and\nwave.  His strength was now nearly at its last.\n\nThe shock of his blindness and the agony of the moments that had passed\nhad finished his exhaustion.  But a little longer and he must have sunk\ninto his rest.  But the voice and the help it promised rallied him for a\nmoment.  He had hardly strength to speak, but he managed to gasp out:","'Where? where?  Help me!  I am blind!'  A hand took his and guided it to\na tightened girth.  Instinctively his fingers closed round it, and he\nhung on grimly.  His senses were going fast.  He felt as if it was all a\nstrange dream.  A voice here in the sea!  A girth!  A horse; he could\nhear its hard breathing.\n\nThe voice came again.\n\n'Steady!  Hold on!  My God! he's fainted!  I must tie him on!'  He heard\na tearing sound, and something was wound round his wrists.  Then his\nnerveless fingers relaxed their hold; and all passed into oblivion.\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII--THE QUEEN'S ROOM\n\n\nTo Stephen all that now happened seemed like a dream.  She saw Hector and\nhis gallant young master forge across the smoother water of the current\nwhose boisterous stream had been somewhat stilled in the churning amongst\nthe rocks, and then go north in the direction of the swimmer who, strange\nto say, was drifting in again towards the sunken rocks.  Then she saw the\nswimmer's head sink under the water; and her heart grew cold.  Was this\nto be the end!  Was such a brave man to be lost after such gallant effort\r\nas he had made, and just at the moment when help was at hand!\n\nThe few seconds seemed ages.  Instinctively she shut her eyes and prayed\nagain.  'Oh! God.  Give me this man's life that I may atone!'\n\nGod seemed to have heard her prayer.  Nay, more!  He had mercifully\nallowed her to be the means of averting great danger.  She would never,\ncould never, forget the look on the man's face when he saw, by the flame\nthat she had kindled, ahead of him the danger from the sunken rocks.  She\nhad exulted at the thought.  And now . . .\r\nShe was recalled by a wild cheer beside her.  Opening her eyes she saw\nthat the man's head had risen again from the water.  He was swimming\nfuriously, this time seaward.  But close at hand were the heads of the\nswimming horse and man . . . She saw the young squire seize the man . . .\n\nAnd then the rush of her tears blinded her.  When she could see again the\nhorse had turned and was making back again to the shelter of the point.\nThe squire had his arm stretched across the horse's back; he was holding\nup the sailor's head, which seemed to roll helplessly with every motion\nof the cumbering sea.","For a little she thought he was dead, but the voice of the old whaler\nreassured her:\n\n'He was just in time!  The poor chap was done!'  And so with beating\nheart and eyes that did not flinch now she watched the slow progress to\nthe shelter of the point.  The coastguards and fishermen had made up\ntheir minds where the landing could be made, and were ready; on the rocky\nshelf, whence Hector had at jumped, they stood by with lines.  When the\nsquire had steered and encouraged the horse, whose snorting could be\r\nheard from the sheltered water, till he was just below the rocks, they\nlowered a noosed rope.  This he fastened round the senseless man below\nhis shoulders.  One strong, careful pull, and he was safe on land; and\nsoon was being borne up the steep zigzag on the shoulders of the willing\ncrowd.\n\nIn the meantime other ropes were passed down to the squire.  One he\nplaced round his own waist; two others he fastened one on each side of\nthe horse's girth.  Then his friend lowered the bridle, and he managed to\nput it on the horse and attached a rope to it.  The fishermen took the\r\nlines, and, paying out as they went so as to leave plenty of slack line,\ngot on the rocks just above the little beach whereon, sheltered though it\nwas, the seas broke heavily.  There they waited, ready to pull the horse\nthrough the surf when he should have come close enough.\n\nStephen did not see the rescue of the horse; for just then a tall grave\nman spoke to her:\n\n'Pardon me, Lady de Lannoy, but is the man to be brought up to the\nCastle?  I am told you have given orders that all the rescued shall be\ntaken there.'  She answered unhesitatingly:\r\n'Certainly!  I gave orders before coming out that preparation was to be\nmade for them.'\n\n'I am Mr. Hilton.  I have just come down to do lacum tenens for Dr.\nWinter at Lannoch Port.  I rode over on hearing there was a wreck, and\ncame here with the rocket-cart.  I shall take charge of the man and bring\nhim up.  He will doubtless want some special care.'\n\n'If you will be so good!' she answered, feeling a diffidence which was\nnew to her.  At that moment the crowd carrying the senseless man began to\nappear over the cliff, coming up the zig-zag.  The Doctor hurried towards","him; she followed at a little distance, fearing lest she should hamper\nhim.  Under his orders they laid the patient on the weather side of the\nbonfire so that the smoke would not reach him.  The Doctor knelt by his\nside.\n\nAn instant after he looked up and said:\n\n'He is alive; his heart is beating, though faintly.  He had better be\ntaken away at once.  There is no means here of shelter.'\n\n'Bring him in the rocket-cart; it is the only conveyance here,' cried\nStephen.  'And bring Mr. Hepburn too.  He also will need some care after\r\nhis gallant service.  I shall ride on and advise my household of your\ncoming.  And you good people come all to the Castle.  You are to be my\nguests if you will so honour me.  No!  No!  Really I should prefer to\nride alone!'\n\nShe said this impulsively, seeing that several of the gentlemen were\nrunning for their horses to accompany her.  'I shall not wait to thank\nthat valiant young gentleman.  I shall see him at Lannoy.'\n\nAs she was speaking she had taken the bridle of her horse.  One of the\nyoung men stooped and held his hand; she bowed, put her foot in it and\r\nsprang to the saddle.  In an instant she was flying across country at\nfull speed, in the dark.  A wild mood was on her, reaction from the\nprolonged agony of apprehension.  There was little which she would not\nhave done just then.\n\nThe gale whistled round her and now and again she shouted with pure joy.\nIt seemed as if God Himself had answered her prayer and given her the\nreturning life!\n\nBy the time she had reached the Castle the wild ride had done its\nsoothing work.  She was calm again, comparatively; her wits and feelings\nwere her own.\r\nThere was plenty to keep her occupied, mind and body.  The train of\npersons saved from the wreck were arriving in all sorts of vehicles, and\nas clothes had to be found for them as well as food and shelter there was\nno end to the exertions necessary.  She felt as though the world were not\nwide enough for the welcome she wished to extend.  Its exercise was a\nsort of reward of her exertions; a thank-offering for the response to her\nprayer.  She moved amongst her guests, forgetful of herself; of her\nstrange attire; of the state of dishevelment and grime in which she was,","the result of the storm, her long ride over rough ground with its share\nof marshes and pools, and the smoke from the bonfire and the blazing\nhouse.  The strangers wondered at first, till they came to understand\nthat she was the Lady Bountiful who had stretched her helpful hands to\nthem.  Those who could, made themselves useful with the new batches of\narrivals.  The whole Castle was lit from cellar to tower.  The kitchens\nwere making lordly provision, the servants were carrying piles of clothes\nof all sorts, and helping to fit those who came still wet from their\r\npassage through or over the heavy sea.\n\nIn the general disposition of chambers Stephen ordered to be set apart\nfor the rescued swimmer the Royal Chamber where Queen Elizabeth had lain;\nand for Mr. Hepburn that which had been occupied by the Second George.\nShe had a sort of idea that the stranger was God's guest who was coming\nto her house; and that nothing could be too good for him.  As she waited\nfor his coming, even though she swept to and fro in her ministrations to\nothers, she felt as though she trod on air.  Some great weight seemed to\r\nhave been removed from her.  Her soul was free again!\n\nAt last the rocket-cart arrived, and with it many horsemen and such men\nand women as could run across country with equal speed to the horses\nlabouring by the longer road.\n\nThe rescued man was still senseless, but that alone did not seem to cause\nanxiety to the Doctor, who hurried him at once into the prepared room.\nWhen, assisted by some of the other men, he had undressed him, rubbed him\ndown and put him to bed, and had seen some of the others who had been\r\nrescued from the wreck, he sought out Lady de Lannoy.  He told her that\nhis anxiety was for the man's sight; an announcement which blanched his\nhearer's cheeks.  She had so made up her mind as to his perfect safety\nthat the knowledge of any kind of ill came like a cruel shock.  She\nquestioned Mr. Hilton closely; so closely that he thought it well to tell\nher at once all that he surmised and feared:\n\n'That fine young fellow who swam out with his horse to him, tells me that\nwhen he neared him he cried out that he was blind.  I have made some","inquiries from those on the ship, and they tell me that he was a\npassenger, named Robinson.  Not only was he not blind then, but he was\nthe strongest and most alert man on the ship.  If it be blindness it must\nhave come on during that long swim.  It may be that before leaving the\nship he received some special injury--indeed he has several cuts and\nburns and bruises--and that the irritation of the sea-water increased it.\nI can do nothing till he wakes.  At present he is in such a state that\nnothing can be done for him.  Later I shall if necessary give him a\r\nhypodermic to ensure sleep.  In the morning when I come again I shall\nexamine him fully.'\n\n'But you are not going away to-night!' said Stephen in dismay.  'Can't\nyou manage to stay here?  Indeed you must!  Look at all these people,\nsome of whom may need special attention or perhaps treatment.  We do not\nknow yet if any may be injured.'  He answered at once:\n\n'Of course I shall stay if you wish it.  But there are two other doctors\nhere already.  I must go over to my own place to get some necessary\r\ninstruments for the examination of this special patient.  But that I can\ndo in the early morning.'\n\n'Can I not send for what you want; the whole household are at your\nservice.  All that can be done for that gallant man must be done.  You\ncan send to London for special help if you wish.  If that man is blind,\nor in danger of blindness, we must have the best oculist in the world for\nhim.'\n\n'All shall be done that is possible,' said he earnestly.  'But till I\nexamine him in the morning we can do nothing.  I am myself an oculist;\nthat is my department in St. Stephen's Hospital.  I have an idea of what\r\nis wrong, but I cannot diagnose exactly until I can use the\nophthalmoscope.'  His words gave Stephen confidence.  Laying her hand on\nhis arm unconsciously in the extremity of pity she said earnestly:\n\n'Oh, do what you can for him.  He must be a noble creature; and all that\nis possible must be done.  I shall never rest happily if through any\nfailing on my part he suffers as you fear.'\n\n'I shall do all I can,' he said with equal earnestness, touched with her\neager pity.  'And I shall not trust myself alone, if any other can be of","service.  Depend upon it, Lady de Lannoy, all shall be as you wish.'\n\nThere was little sleep in the Castle that night till late.  Mr. Hilton\nslept on a sofa in the Queen's Room after he had administered a narcotic\nto his patient.\n\nAs soon as the eastern sky began to quicken, he rode, as he had arranged\nduring the evening, to Dr. Winter's house at Lannoch Port where he was\nstaying.  After selecting such instruments and drugs as he required, he\ncame back in the dogcart.\n\nIt was still early morning when he regained the Castle.  He found Lady de\r\nLannoy up and looking anxiously for him.  Her concern was somewhat abated\nwhen he was able to tell her that his patient still slept.\n\nIt was a painful scene for Mr. Hilton when his patient woke.  Fortunately\nsome of the after-effects of the narcotic remained, for his despair at\nrealising that he was blind was terrible.  It was not that he was\nviolent; to be so under his present circumstances would have been foreign\nto Harold's nature.  But there was a despair which was infinitely more\nsad to witness than passion.  He simply moaned to himself:\r\n'Blind!  Blind!' and again in every phase of horrified amazement, as\nthough he could not realise the truth: 'Blind!  Blind!'  The Doctor laid\nhis hand on his breast and said very gently:\n\n'My poor fellow, it is a dreadful thing to face, to think of.  But as yet\nI have not been able to come to any conclusion; unable even to examine\nyou.  I do not wish to encourage hopes that may be false, but there are\ncases when injury is not vital and perhaps only temporary.  In such case\nyour best chance, indeed your only chance, is to keep quiet.  You must\r\nnot even think if possible of anything that may excite you.  I am now\nabout to examine you with the ophthalmoscope.  You are a man; none of us\nwho saw your splendid feat last night can doubt your pluck.  Now I want\nyou to use some of it to help us both.  You, for your recovery, if such\nis possible; me, to help me in my work.  I have asked some of your late\ncompanions who tell me that on shipboard you were not only well and of\ngood sight, but that you were remarkable even amongst strong men.\nWhatever it is you suffer from must have come on quickly.  Tell me all\nyou can remember of it.'","The Doctor listened attentively whilst Harold told all he could remember\nof his sufferings.  When he spoke of the return of old rheumatic pains\nhis hearer said involuntarily: 'Good!'  Harold paused; but went on at\nonce.  The Doctor recognised that he had rightly appraised his remark,\nand by it judged that he was a well-educated man.  Something in the\nmethod of speaking struck him, and he said, as nonchalantly as he could:\n\n'By the way, which was your University?'\n\n'Cambridge.  Trinity.'  He spoke without thinking, and the instant he had\r\ndone so stopped.  The sense of his blindness rushed back on him.  He\ncould not see; and his ears were not yet trained to take the place of his\neyes.  He must guard himself.  Thenceforward he was so cautious in his\nreplies that Mr. Hilton felt convinced there was some purpose in his\nreticence.  He therefore stopped asking questions, and began to examine\nhim.  He was unable to come to much result; his opinion was shown in his\nreport to Lady de Lannoy:\n\n'I am unable to say anything definite as yet.  The case is a most\ninteresting one; as a case and quite apart from the splendid fellow who\r\nis the subject of it.  I have hopes that within a few days I may be able\nto know more.  I need not trouble you with surgical terms; but later on\nif the diagnosis supports the supposition at present in my mind I shall\nbe able to speak more fully.  In the meantime I shall, with your\npermission, wait here so that I may watch him myself.'\n\n'Oh you are good.  Thank you!  Thank you!' said Stephen.  She had so\ntaken the man under her own care that she was grateful for any kindness\nshown to him.\n\n'Not at all,' said Mr. Hilton.  'Any man who behaved as that fellow did\r\nhas a claim on any of us who may help him.  No time of mine could be\nbetter spent.'\n\nWhen he went back to the patient's room he entered softly, for he thought\nhe might be asleep.  The room was, according to his instructions, quite\ndark, and as it was unfamiliar to him he felt his way cautiously.  Harold,\nhowever, heard the small noise he made and said quietly:\n\n'Who is there?'\n\n'It is I; Hilton.'\n\n'Are you alone?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Look round the room and see.  Then lock the door and come and talk to me","if you will.  You will pity a poor blind fellow, I know.  The darkness\nhas come down upon me so quickly that I am not accustomed to it!'  There\nwas a break in his voice which moved the other.  He lit a candle, feeling\nthat the doing so would impress his patient, and went round the room; not\nwith catlike movement this time--he wanted the other to hear him.  When\nhe had turned the key in the lock, as sharply as he could, he came to the\nbedside and sat down.  Harold spoke again after a short pause:\n\n'Is that candle still lit?'\n\n'Yes!  Would you like it put out?'\r\n'If you don't mind!  Again I say pity me and pardon me.  But I want to\nask you something privately, between our two selves; and I will feel more\nof equality than if you were looking at me, whilst I cannot see you.'  Mr\nHilton blew out the candle.\n\n'There!  We are equal now.'\n\n'Thank you!'  A long pause; then he went on:\n\n'When a man becomes suddenly blind is there usually, or even\noccasionally, any sort of odd sight? . . . Does he see anything like a\ndream, a vision?'\n\n'Not that I know of.  I have never heard of such a case.  As a rule\r\npeople struck blind by lightning, which is the most common cause,\nsometimes remember with extraordinary accuracy the last thing they have\nseen.  Just as though it were photographed on the retina!'\n\n'Thank you!  Is such usually the recurrence of any old dream or anything\nthey have much thought of?'\n\n'Not that I know of.  It would be unusual!'  Harold waited a long time\nbefore he spoke again.  When he did so it was in a different voice; a\nconstrained voice.  The Doctor, accustomed to take enlightenment from\ntrivial details, noted it:\r\n'Now tell me, Mr. Hilton, something about what has happened.  Where am\nI?'\n\n'In Lannoy Castle.'\n\n'Where is it?'\n\n'In Angleshire!'\n\n'Who does it belong to?'\n\n'Lady de Lannoy.  The Countess de Lannoy; they tell me she is a Countess\nin her own right.'\n\n'It is very good of her to have me here.  Is she an old lady?'\n\n'No!  A young one.  Young and very beautiful.'  After a pause before his\nquery:\n\n'What's she like?  Describe her to me!'\n\n'She is young, a little over twenty.  Tall and of a very fine figure.  She\nhas eyes like black diamonds, and hair like a flame!'  For a long time","Harold remained still.  Then he said:\n\n'Tell me all you know or have learned of this whole affair.  How was I\nrescued, and by whom?'  So the Doctor proceeded to give him every detail\nhe knew of.  When he was quite through, the other again lay still for a\nlong time.  The silence was broken by a gentle tap at the door.  The\nDoctor lit a candle.  He turned the key softly, so that no one would\nnotice that the door was locked.  Something was said in a low whisper.\nThen the door was gently closed, and the Doctor returning said:\r\n'Lady Lannoy wants, if it will not disturb you, to ask how you are.\nOrdinarily I should not let anyone see you.  But she is not only your\nhostess, but, as I have just told you, it was her ride to the headland,\nwhere she burned the house to give you light, which was the beginning of\nyour rescue.  Still if you think it better not . . . !'\n\n'I hardly like anybody to see me like this!' said Harold, feebly seeking\nan excuse.\n\n'My dear man,' said the other, 'you may be easy in your mind, she won't\nsee much of you.  You are all bandages and beard.  She'll have to wait a\r\nwhile before she sees you.'\n\n'Didn't she see me last night?'\n\n'Not she!  Whilst we were trying to restore you she was rushing back to\nthe Castle to see that all was ready for you, and for the others from the\nwreck.'  This vaguely soothed Harold.\n\nIf his surmise was correct, and if she had not seen him then, it was well\nthat he was bandaged now.  He felt that it would not do to refuse to let\nher see him; it might look suspicious.  So after pausing a short while he\nsaid in a low voice:\n\n'I suppose she had better come now.  We must not keep her waiting!'  When\r\nthe Doctor brought her to his bedside Stephen felt in a measure awed.  His\nbandaged face and head and his great beard, singed in patches, looked to\nher in the dim light rather awesome.  In a very gentle voice she said\nkind things to the sick man, who acknowledged them in a feeble whisper.\nThe Doctor, a keen observer, noticed the change in his voice, and\ndetermined to understand more.  Stephen spoke of his bravery, and of how\nit was due to him that all on the ship were saved; and as she spoke her","emotion moved her so much that her sweet voice shook and quivered.  To\nthe ears of the man who had now only sound to guide him, it was music of\nthe sweetest he had ever heard.  Fearing lest his voice should betray\nhim, he whispered his own thanks feebly and in few words.\n\nWhen Stephen went away the Doctor went with her; it was more than an hour\nbefore he returned.  He found his patient in what he considered a state\nof suppressed excitement; for, though his thoughts were manifestly\ncollected and his words were calm, he was restless and excited in other\r\nways.  He had evidently been thinking of his own condition; for shortly\nafter the Doctor came in he said:\n\n'Are we alone?'\n\n'Quite!'\n\n'I want you to arrange that there shall not be any nurse with me.'\n\n'My dear sir!  Don't handicap me, and yourself, with such a restriction.\nIt is for your own good that you should have regular and constant\nattention.'\n\n'But I don't wish it.  Not for the present at all events.  I am not\naccustomed to a nurse, and shall not feel comfortable.  In a few days\nperhaps . . . '  The decided tone of his voice struck the other.  Keeping\r\nhis own thoughts and intentions in abeyance, even to himself, he answered\nheartily:\n\n'All right!  I shall not have any nurse, at present.'\n\n'Thanks!'  There was relief in the tone which seemed undue, and Mr.\nHilton again took mental note.  Presently he asked a question, but in\nsuch a tone that the Doctor pricked up his ears.  There was a\npremeditated self-suppression, a gravity of restraint, which implied some\nfalsity; some intention other than the words conveyed:\n\n'It must have been a job to carry me up those stairs.'  The Doctor was\r\ndoubting everything, but as the safest attitude he stuck to literal truth\nso far as his words conveyed it:\n\n'Yes.  You are no light weight!'  To himself he mused:\n\n'How did he know there were stairs?  He cannot know it; he was senseless!\nTherefore he must be guessing or inquiring!'  Harold went on:\n\n'I suppose the Castle is on high ground.  Can you see far from the\nwindows?  I suppose we are up a good height?'\n\n'From the windows you can see all round the promontory.  But we are not\nhigh up; that is, the room is not high from the ground, though the Castle","is from the sea.'  Harold asked again, his voice vibrating in the note of\ngladness:\n\n'Are we on the ground floor then?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'And I suppose the gardens are below us?'\n\n'Yes.'  The answer was given quickly, for a thought was floating through\nhim: Why did this strong brave man, suddenly stricken blind, wish to know\nwhether his windows were at a height?  He was not surprised when his\npatient reaching out a hand rested it on his arm and said in an imploring\ntone:\n\n'It should be moonlight; full moon two nights ago.  Won't you pull up the\r\nblind and describe to me all you see? . . . Tell me fully . . . Remember,\nI am blind!'\n\nThis somehow fixed the Doctor's thought:\n\n'Suicide!  But I must convey the inutility of such effort by inference,\nnot falsity.'\n\nAccordingly he began to describe the scene, from the very base of the\nwall, where below the balcony the great border was glorious with a mass\nof foliage plants, away to the distant sea, now bathed in the flood of\nmoonlight.  Harold asked question after question; the Doctor replying\naccurately till he felt that the patient was building up a concrete idea\r\nof his surroundings near and far.  Then he left him.  He stood for a long\ntime out in the passage thinking.  He said to himself as he moved away:\n\n'The poor fellow has some grim intention in his mind.  I must not let him\nknow that I suspect; but to-night I will watch without his knowing it!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV--WAITING\n\n\nMr. Hilton telegraphed at once countermanding, for the present, the nurse\nfor whom he had sent.\n\nThat night, when the household had all retired, he came quietly to his\npatient's room, and entering noiselessly, sat silent in a far corner.\r\nThere was no artificial right; the patient had to be kept in darkness.\nThere was, however, a bright moonlight; sufficient light stole in through\nthe edges of the blinds to allow him, when his eyes grew accustomed, to\nsee what might happen.\n\nHarold lay quite still till the house was quiet.  He had been thinking,\never since he had ascertained the identity of Stephen.  In his weakness\nand the paralysing despair of his blindness all his former grief and\napprehension had come bank upon him in a great wave; veritably the tide","of circumstances seemed to run hard against him.  He had had no idea of\nforcing himself upon Stephen; and yet here he was a guest in her house,\nwithout her knowledge or his own.  She had saved his life by her energy\nand resource.  Fortunately she did not as yet know him; the bandages, and\nhis act in suppressing his voice, had so far protected him.  But such\ncould not last for long.  He could not see to protect himself, and take\nprecautions as need arose.  And he knew well that Stephen's nature would\nnot allow her to be satisfied without doing all that was possible to help\r\none who had under her eyes made a great effort on behalf of others, and\nto whom there was the added bond that his life was due to her.  In but a\nlittle time she must find out to whom she ministered.\n\nWhat then would happen?  Her kindness was such that when she realised the\nblindness of her old friend she might so pity him that out of the depths\nof her pity she would forgive.  She would take back all the past; and now\nthat she knew of his old love for her, would perhaps be willing to marry\nhim.  Back flooded the old memory of her independence and her theory of\r\nsexual equality.  If out of any selfish or mistaken idea she did not\nhesitate to ask a man to marry her, would it be likely that when the\nnobler and more heroic side of her nature spoke she would hesitate to a\nsimilar act in pursuance of her self-sacrifice?\n\nSo it might be that she would either find herself once again flouted, or\nelse married to a man she did not love.\n\nSuch a catastrophe should not happen, whatever the cost to him.  He\nwould, blind as he was, steal away in the night and take himself out of\r\nher life; this time for ever.  Better the ingratitude of an unknown man,\nthe saving of whose life was due to her, than the long dull routine of a\nspoiled life, which would otherwise be her unhappy lot.\n\nWhen once this idea had taken root in his mind he had taken such steps as\nhad been open to him without endangering the secrecy of his motive.\nThanks to his subtle questioning of the Doctor, he now knew that his room\nwas close to the ground, so that he would easily drop from the window and\nsteal away with out immediate danger of any restraining accident.  If he","could once get away he would be all right.  There was a large sum to his\ncredit in each of two London banks.  He would manage somehow to find his\nway to London; even if he had to walk and beg his way.\n\nHe felt that now in the silence of the night the time had come.  Quietly\nhe rose and felt his way to the door, now and again stumbling and\nknocking against unknown obstacles in the manner of the recently blind.\nAfter each such noise he paused and listened.  He felt as if the very\nwalls had ears.  When he reached the door he turned the key softly.  Then\r\nhe breathed more freely.  He felt that he was at last alone and free to\nmove without suspicion.\n\nThen began a great and arduous search; one that was infinitely difficult\nand exasperating; and full of pathos to the sympathetic man who watched\nhim in silence.  Mr. Hilton could not understand his movements as he felt\nhis way about the room, opening drawers and armoires, now and again\nstooping down and feeling along the floor.  He did not betray his\npresence, however, but moved noiselessly away as the other approached.  It\r\nwas a hideously real game of blindman's-buff, with perhaps a life as the\nforfeit.\n\nHarold went all over the room, and at last sat down on the edge of his\nbed with a hollow suppressed groan that was full of pain.  He had found\nhis clothes, but realised that they were now but rags.  He put on the\nclothes, and then for a long time sat quiet, rocking gently to and fro as\none in pain, a figure of infinite woe.  At last he roused himself.  His\nmind was made up; the time for action had come.  He groped his way\ntowards the window looking south.  The Doctor, who had taken off his\r\nshoes, followed him with catlike stealthiness.\n\nHe easily threw open the window, for it was already partly open for\nventilation.\n\nWhen Mr. Hilton saw him sit on the rail of the balcony and begin to raise\nhis feet, getting ready to drop over, he rushed forward and seized him.\nHarold instinctively grappled with him; the habit of his Alaskan life\namidst continual danger made in such a case action swift as thought.  Mr.\nHilton, with the single desire to prevent him from killing himself, threw\nhimself backward and pulled Harold with him to the stone floor.","Harold, as he held him in a grip of iron, thundered out, forgetful in the\nexcitement of the moment the hushed voice to which he had limited\nhimself:\n\n'What do you want? who are you?'\n\n'H-s-s-sh!  I am Mr. Hilton.'  Harold relaxed the rigour of his grasp but\nstill held him firmly:\n\n'How did you come here?  I locked my door!'\n\n'I have been in the room a long time.  I suspected something, and came to\nwatch; to prevent your rash act.'\n\n'Rash act!  How?'\n\n'Why, man, if you didn't kill, you would at least cripple yourself.'\r\n'How can I cripple myself when the flower-bed is only a few feet below?'\n\n'There are other dangers for a man who--a man in your sad state.  And,\nbesides, have I no duty to prevent a suicide!'  Here a brilliant idea\nstruck Harold.  This man had evidently got some wrong impression; but it\nwould serve to shield his real purpose.  He would therefore encourage it.\nFor the moment, of course, his purpose to escape unnoticed was foiled;\nbut he would wait, and in due time seize another opportunity.  In a\nharder and more determined tone than he had yet used he said:\r\n'I don't see what right you have to interfere.  I shall kill myself if I\nlike.'\n\n'Not whilst you are in my care!'  This was spoken with a resolution equal\nto his own.  Then Mr. Hilton went on, more softly and with infinite\ncompassion: 'Moreover, I want to have a talk with you which may alter\nyour views.'  Harold interrupted, still playing the game of hiding his\nreal purpose:\n\n'I shall do as I wish; as I intend.'\n\n'You are injuring yourself even now by standing in the draught of that\nopen window.  Your eyes will feel it before long . . . Are you mad . . .\n?'\r\nHarold felt a prick like a pin in his neck; and turned to seize his\ncompanion.  He could not find him, and for a few moments stumbled through\nthe dark, raging . . .\n\nIt seemed a long time before he remembered anything.  He had a sense of\ntime lapsed; of dreamland thoughts and visions.  Then gradually\nrecollection came back.  He tried to move; but found it impossible.  His\narms and legs were extended wide and were tied; he could feel the cord\nhurting his wrists and ankles as he moved.  To him it was awful to be\nthus blind and helpless; and anger began to surge up.  He heard the voice","of Mr. Hilton close by him speaking in a calm, grave, sympathetic tone:\n\n'My poor fellow, I hated to take such a step; but it was really necessary\nfor your own safety.  You are a man, and a brave one.  Won't you listen\nto me for a few minutes?  When you have heard what I have to say I shall\nrelease you.  In the meantime I apologise for the outrage, as I dare say\nyou consider it!'  Harold was reasonable; and he was now blind and\nhelpless.  Moreover, there was something in the Doctor's voice that\ncarried a sense of power with it.\r\n'Go on! I shall listen!'  He compelled himself to quietude.  The Doctor\nsaw, and realised that he was master of himself.  There were some snips\nof scissors, and he was free.\n\n'See! all I want is calm for a short time, and you have it.  May I go\non?'\n\n'Go on!' said Harold, not without respect.  The Doctor after a pause\nspoke:\n\n'My poor fellow, I want you to understand that I wish to help you, to do\nall in my power to restore to you that which you seem to have lost!  I\ncan sympathise with your desire to quit life altogether now that the best\r\npart of it, sight, seems gone.  I do not pretend to judge the actions of\nmy fellows; and if you determine to carry out your purpose I shall not be\nable to prevent you for ever.  I shall not try to.  But you certainly\nshall not do so till you know what I know!  I had wished to wait till I\ncould be a little more certain before I took you into confidence with\nregard to my guessing as to the future.  But your desire to destroy\nyourself forces my hand.  Now let me tell you that there is a possibility\nof the removal of the cause of your purpose.'\r\n'What do you mean?' gasped Harold.  He was afraid to think outright and\nto the full what the other's words seemed to imply.\n\n'I mean,' said the other solemnly, 'that there is a possibility, more\nthan a possibility, that you may recover your sight!'  As he spoke there\nwas a little break in his voice.  He too was somewhat unnerved at the\nsituation.\n\nHarold lay still.  The whole universe seemed to sway, and then whirl\nround him in chaotic mass.  Through it at length he seemed to hear the\ncalm voice:\n\n'At first I could not be sure of my surmise, for when I used the","ophthalmoscope your suffering was too recent to disclose the cause I\nlooked for.  Now I am fairly sure of it.  What I have since heard from\nyou has convinced me; your having suffered from rheumatic fever, and the\nrecrudescence of the rheumatic pain after your terrible experience of the\nfire and that long chilling swim with so seemingly hopeless an end to it;\nthe symptoms which I have since noticed, though they have not been as\nenlightening to me as they might be.  Your disease, as I have diagnosed\nit, is an obscure one and not common.  I have not before been able to\r\nstudy a case.  All these things give me great hopes.'\n\n'Thank God!  Thank God!' the voice from the bed was now a whisper.\n\n'Thank God! say I too.  This that you suffer from is an acute form of\ninflammation of the optic nerve.  It may of course end badly; in\npermanent loss of sight.  But I hope--I believe, that in your case it\nwill not be so.  You are young, and you are immensely strong; not merely\nmuscularly, but in constitution.  I can see that you have been an\nathlete, and no mean one either.  All this will stand to you.  But it\r\nwill take time.  It will need all your own help; all the calm restraint\nof your body and your mind.  I am doing all that science knows; you must\ndo the rest!'  He waited, giving time to the other to realise his ideas.\nHarold lay still for a long time before he spoke:\n\n'Doctor.'  The voice was so strangely different that the other was more\nhopeful at once.  He had feared opposition, or conflict of some kind.  He\nanswered as cheerily as he could:\n\n'Yes!  I am listening.'\n\n'You are a good fellow; and I am grateful to you, both for what you have\r\ndone and what you have told me.  I cannot say how grateful just yet; hope\nunmans me at present.  But I think you deserve that I should tell you the\ntruth!'  The other nodded; he forgot that the speaker could not see.\n\n'I was not intending to commit suicide.  Such an idea didn't even enter\nmy head.  To me, suicide is the resource of a coward.  I have been in too\nmany tight places to ever fear that.'\n\n'Then in the name of goodness why were you trying to get out of that\nwindow?'\n\n'I wanted to escape; to get away!'\n\n'In your shirt and trousers; and they are not over much!  Without even","slippers!'  A faint smile curled round the lips of the injured man.  Hope\nwas beginning to help already.\n\n'Even that way!'\n\n'But man alive! you were going to your death.  How could you expect to\nget away in such an outfit without being discovered?  When you were\nmissed the whole countryside would have been up, and even before the hue-\nand-cry the first person who saw you would have taken charge of you.'\n\n'I know!  I know!  I had thought of it all.  But I was willing to chance\nit.  I had my own reasons!'  He was silent a while.  The Doctor was\r\nsilent too.  Each man was thinking in his own way.  Presently the Doctor\nspoke:\n\n'Look here, old chap!  I don't want to pry into your secrets; but, won't\nyou let me help you?  I can hold my tongue.  I want to help you.  You\nhave earned that wish from any man, and woman too, who saw the burning\nship and what you did to save those on board.  There is nothing I would\nnot do for you.  Nothing!  I don't ask you to tell me all; only enough\nfor me to understand and help.  I can see that you have some overpowering\nwish to get away.  Some reason that I cannot fathom, certainly without a\r\nclue.  You may trust me, I assure you.  If you could look into my face,\nmy eyes, you would understand.  But--There! take my hand.  It may tell\nyou something!'\n\nHarold took the hand placed in his, and held it close.  He pressed his\nother hand over it also, as though the effect of the two hands would\nbring him double knowledge.  It was infinitely pathetic to see him trying\nto make his untrained fingers do the duty of his trained eyes.  But,\ntrained or not, his hands had their instinct.  Laying down gently the\r\nhand he held he said, turning his bandaged eyes in the direction of his\ncompanion:\n\n'I shall trust you!  Are we alone; absolutely alone?'\n\n'Absolutely!'\n\n'Have I your solemn promise that anything I say shall never go beyond\nyourself?'\n\n'I promise.  I can swear, if it will make your mind more easy in the\nmatter.'\n\n'What do you hold most sacred in the world?'  Harold had an odd thought;\nhis question was its result.\n\n'All told, I should think my profession!  Perhaps it doesn't seem to you\nmuch to swear by; but it is all my world!  But I have been brought up in","honour, and you may trust my promise--as much as anything I could swear.'\n\n'All right!  My reason for wanting to get away was because I knew Lady de\nLannoy!'\n\n'What!'  Then after a pause: 'I should have thought that was a reason for\nwanting to stay.  She seems not only one of the most beautiful, but the\nsweetest woman I ever met.'\n\n'She is all that!  And a thousand times more!'\n\n'Then why--Pardon me!'\n\n'I cannot tell you all; but you must take it that my need to get away is\nimperative.'  After pondering a while Mr. Hilton said suddenly:\r\n'I must ask your pardon again.  Are you sure there is no mistake.  Lady\nde Lannoy is not married; has not been.  She is Countess in her own\nright.  It is quite a romance.  She inherited from some old branch of\nmore than three hundred years ago.'  Again Harold smiled; he quite saw\nwhat the other meant.\n\nHe answered gravely\n\n'I understand.  But it does not alter my opinion; my purpose.  It is\nneedful--absolutely and imperatively needful that I get away without her\nrecognising me, or knowing who I am.'\n\n'She does not know you now.  She has not seen you yet.'\r\n'That is why I hoped to get away in time; before she should recognise me.\nIf I stay quiet and do all you wish, will you help me?'\n\n'I will!  And what then?'\n\n'When I am well, if it should be so, I shall steal away, this time\nclothed, and disappear out of her life without her knowing.  She may\nthink it ungrateful that one whom she has treated so well should behave\nso badly.  But that can't be helped.  It is the lesser evil of the two.'\n\n'And I must abet you?  All right!  I will do it; though you must forgive\nme if you should ever hear that I have abused you and said bad things of\r\nyou.  It will have to be all in the day's work if I am not ultimately to\ngive you away.  I must take steps at once to keep her from seeing you.  I\nshall have to invent some story; some new kind of dangerous disease,\nperhaps.  I shall stay here and nurse you myself!'  Harold spoke in\njoyful gratitude:\n\n'Oh, you _are_ good.  But can you spare the time?  How long will it all\ntake?'\n\n'Some weeks!  Perhaps!'  He paused as if thinking.  'Perhaps in a month's\ntime I shall unbandage your eyes.  You will then see; or . . . '","'I understand!  I shall be patient!'\n\nIn the morning Mr. Hilton in reporting to Lady de Lannoy told her that he\nconsidered it would be necessary to keep his patient very quiet, both in\nmind and body.  In the course of the conversation he said:\n\n'Anything which might upset him must be studiously avoided.  He is not an\neasy patient to deal with; he doesn't like people to go near him.  I\nthink, therefore, it will be well if even you do not see him.  He seems\nto have an odd distrust of people, especially of women.  It may be that\r\nhe is fretful in his blindness, which is in itself so trying to a strong\nman.  But besides, the treatment is not calculated to have a very buoyant\neffect.  It is apt to make a man fretful to lie in the dark, and know\nthat he has to do so for indefinite weeks.  Pilocarpin, and salicylate of\nsoda, and mercury do not tend towards cheerfulness.  Nor do blisters on\nthe forehead add to the content of life!'\n\n'I quite understand,' said Stephen, 'and I will be careful not to go near\nhim till he is well.  Please God! it may bring him back his sight.  Thank\r\nyou a thousand times for your determination to stay with him.'\n\nSo it was that for more than two weeks Harold was kept all alone.  No one\nattended him but the Doctor.  He slept in the patient's room for the\nwhole of the first week, and never had him out of sight for more than a\nfew minutes at a time.  He was then able to leave him alone for longer\nperiods, and settled himself in the bedroom next to him.  Every hour or\ntwo he would visit him.  Occasionally he would be away for half a day,\nbut never for more.  Stephen rigidly observed the Doctor's advice\r\nherself, and gave strict orders that his instructions were to be obeyed.\n\nHarold himself went through a period of mental suffering.  It was agony\nto him to think of Stephen being so near at hand, and yet not to be able\nto see her, or even to hear her voice.  All the pain of his loss of her\naffection seemed to crowd back on him, and with it the new need of\nescaping from her unknown.  More than ever he felt it would not do that\nshe should ever learn his identity.  Her pity for him, and possibly her\nwoman's regard for a man's effort in time of stress, might lead through","the gates of her own self-sacrifice to his restoration to his old place\nin her affections.  Nay! it could not be his old place; for at the close\nof those days she had learned of his love for her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV--A CRY\n\n\nThe third week had nearly elapsed, and as yet no one was allowed to see\nthe patient.\n\nFor a time Stephen was inclined to be chagrined.  It is not pleasant to\nhave even the most generous and benevolent intentions thwarted; and she\nhad set her mind on making much of this man whom fate and his own bravery\r\nhad thrown athwart her life.  But in these days Stephen was in some ways\na changed woman.  She had so much that she wished to forget and that she\nwould have given worlds to recall, that she could not bear even to think\nof any militant or even questioning attitude.  She even began to take\nherself to task more seriously than she had ever done with regard to\nsocial and conventional duties.  When she found her house full of so many\nand so varied guests, it was borne in upon her that such a position as\nher own, with such consequent duties, called for the presence of some\r\nelder person of her own sex and of her own class.\n\nNo better proof of Stephen's intellectual process and its result could be\nadduced than her first act of recognition: she summoned an elderly lady\nto live with her and matronise her house.  This lady, the widow of a\ndistant relation, complied with all the charted requirements of\nrespectability, and had what to Stephen's eyes was a positive gift: that\nof minding her own business and not interfering in any matter whatever.\nLady de Lannoy, she felt, was her own master and quite able to take care\r\nof herself.  Her own presence was all that convention required.  So she\nlimited herself to this duty, with admirable result to all, herself\nincluded.  After a few days Stephen would almost forget that she was\npresent.\n\nMr. Hilton kept bravely to his undertaking.  He never gave even a hint of\nhis hopes of the restoration of sight; and he was so assiduous in his\nattention that there arose no opportunity of accidental discovery of the\nsecret.  He knew that when the time did come he would find himself in a\nvery unpleasant situation.  Want of confidence, and even of intentional","deceit, might be attributed to him; and he would not be able to deny nor\nexplain.  He was, however; determined to stick to his word.  If he could\nbut save his patient's sight he would be satisfied.\n\nBut to Stephen all the mystery seemed to grow out of its first shadowy\nimportance into something real.  There was coming to her a vague idea\nthat she would do well not to manifest any concern, any anxiety, any\ncuriosity.  Instinct was at work; she was content to trust it, and wait.\n\nOne forenoon she received by messenger a letter which interested her\r\nmuch.  So much that at first she was unwilling to show it to anyone, and\ntook it to her own boudoir to read over again in privacy.  She had a sort\nof feeling of expectancy with regard to it; such as sensitive natures\nfeel before a thunderstorm.  The letter was natural enough in itself.  It\nwas dated that morning from Varilands, a neighbouring estate which\nmarched with Lannoy to the south.\n\n   'MY DEAR MADAM,--Will you pardon me a great liberty, and allow my\n   little girl and me to come to see you to-day?  I shall explain when we\r\nmeet.  When I say that we are Americans and have come seven thousand\n   miles for the purpose, you will, I am sure, understand that it is no\n   common interest which has brought us, and it will be the excuse for\n   our eagerness.  I should write you more fully, but as the matter is a\n   confidential one I thought it would be better to speak.  We shall be\n   doubly grateful if you will have the kindness to see us alone.  I\n   write as a mother in making this appeal to your kindness; for my\n   child--she is only a little over eight years old--has the matter so\r\ndeeply in her heart that any disappointment or undue delay would I\n   fear affect her health.  We presume to take your kindness for granted\n   and will call a little before twelve o'clock.\n\n   'I may perhaps say (in case you should feel any hesitation as to my\n   _bona fides_) that my husband purchased some years ago this estate.  We\n   were to have come here to live in the early summer, but were kept in\n   the West by some important business of his.\n\n   'Believe me, yours sincerely,\n   'ALICE STONEHOUSE.'","Stephen had, of course, no hesitation as to receiving the lady.  Even had\nthere been objection, the curiosity she had in common with her kind would\nhave swept difficulties aside.  She gave orders that when Mrs. Stonehouse\narrived with her daughter they were to be shown at once into the Mandarin\ndrawing-room.  That they would probably stay for lunch.  She would see\nthem alone.\n\nA little before twelve o'clock Mrs. Stonehouse and Pearl arrived, and\nwere shown into the room where Lady de Lannoy awaited them.  The high\r\nsun, streaming in from the side, shone on her beautiful hair, making it\nlook like living gold.  When the Americans came in they were for an\ninstant entranced by her beauty.  One glance at Mrs. Stonehouse's sweet\nsympathetic face was enough to establish her in Stephen's good graces\nforever.  As for Pearl, she was like one who has unexpectedly seen a\nfairy or a goddess.  She had been keeping guardedly behind her mother,\nbut on the instant she came out fearlessly into the open.\n\nStephen advanced quickly and shook hands with Mrs. Stonehouse, saying\nheartily:\r\n'I am so glad you have come.  I am honoured in being trusted.'\n\n'Thank you so much, Lady de Lannoy.  I felt that you would not mind,\nespecially when you know why we came.  Indeed I had no choice.  Pearl\ninsisted on it; and when Pearl is urgent--we who love her have all to\ngive way.  This is Pearl!'\n\nIn an instant Stephen was on her knees by the beautiful child.\n\nThe red rosebud of a mouth was raised to her kiss, and the little arms\nwent lovingly round her neck and clung to her.  As the mother looked on\ndelighted she thought she had never seen a more beautiful sight.  The two\r\nfaces so different, and yet with so much in common.  The red hair and the\nflaxen, both tints of gold.  The fine colour of each heightened to a\nbright flush in their eagerness.  Stephen was so little used to children,\nand yet loved them so, that all the womanhood in her, which is possible\nmotherhood, went out in an instant to the lovely eager child.  She felt\nthe keenest pleasure when the little thing, having rubbed her silk-gloved\npalms over her face, and then holding her away so that she could see her\nmany beauties, whispered in her ear:","'How pretty you are!'\n\n'You darling!' whispered Stephen in reply.  'We must love each other very\nmuch, you and I!'\n\nWhen the two ladies had sat down, Stephen holding Pearl in her lap, Mrs.\nStonehouse said:\n\n'I suppose you have wondered, Lady de Lannoy, what has brought us here?'\n\n'Indeed I was very much interested.'\n\n'Then I had better tell you all from the beginning so that you may\nunderstand.'  She proceeded to give the details of the meeting with Mr.\nRobinson on the _Scoriac_.  Of how Pearl took to him and insisted on\r\nmaking him her special friend; of the terrible incident of her being\nswept overboard, and of the gallant rescue.  Mrs. Stonehouse was much\nmoved as she spoke.  All that fearful time, of which the minutes had\nseemed years of agony, came back to her so vividly at times that she\ncould hardly speak.  Pearl listened too; all eagerness, but without fear.\nStephen was greatly moved and held Pearl close to her all the time, as\nthough protecting her.  When the mother spoke of her feeling when she saw\nthe brave man struggling up and down the giant waves, and now and again\r\nlosing sight of him in the trough of the sea, she put out one hand and\nheld the mother's with a grasp which vibrated in sympathy, whilst the\ngreat tears welled over in her eyes and ran down her cheeks.  Pearl,\nwatching her keenly, said nothing, but taking her tiny cambric\nhandkerchief from her pocket silently wiped the tears away, and clung all\nthe tighter.  It was her turn to protect now!\n\nPearl's own time for tears came when her mother began to tell this new\nand sympathetic friend of how she became so much attached to her rescuer\r\nthat when she knew he would not be coming to the West with them, but\ngoing off to the wildest region of the far North, her health became\nimpaired; and that it was only when Mr. Robinson promised to come back to\nsee her within three years that she was at all comforted.  And how, ever\nsince, she had held the man in her heart and thought of him every day;\nsleeping as well as waking, for he was a factor in her dreams!\n\nStephen was more than ever moved, for the child's constancy touched her\nas well as her grief.  She strained the little thing in her strong young","arms, as though the fervency of her grasp would bring belief and comfort;\nas it did.  She in her turn dried the others' eyes.  Then Mrs. Stonehouse\nwent on with her story:\n\n'We were at Banff, high up in the Rockies, when we read of the burning\nand wrecking of the _Dominion_.  It is, as you know, a Montreal boat of\nthe Allan Line; so that naturally there was a full telegraphic report in\nall the Canadian papers.  When we read of the brave man who swam ashore\nwith the line and who was unable to reach the port but swam out across\r\nthe bay, Pearl took it for granted that it must have been \"The Man,\" as\nshe always called Mr. Robinson.  When by the next paper we learned that\nthe man's name _was_ Robinson nothing would convince her that it was not\n_her_ Mr. Robinson.  My husband, I may tell you, had firmly come to the\nsame conclusion.  He had ever since the rescue of our child always looked\nfor any news from Alaska, whither he knew Mr. Robinson had gone.  He\nlearned that up away in the very far North a new goldfield had been\ndiscovered by a man of the same name; and that a new town, Robinson City,\r\nbegan to grow up in the wilderness, where the condition of life from the\ncold was a new experience to even the most hardy gold miners.  Then we\nbegan to think that the young hero who had so gallantly saved our darling\nwas meeting some of his reward . . . !'\n\nShe paused, her voice breaking.  Stephen was in a glow of holy feeling.\nGladness, joy, gratitude, enthusiasm; she knew not which.  It all seemed\nlike a noble dream which was coming true.  Mrs. Stonehouse went on:-\n\n'From Californian papers of last month we learned that Robinson, of\r\nRobinson City, had sailed for San Francisco, but had disappeared when the\nship touched at Portland; and then the whole chain of his identity seemed\ncomplete.  Nothing would satisfy Pearl but that we should come at once to\nEngland and see \"The Man,\" who was wounded and blind, and do what we\ncould for him.  Her father could not then come himself; he had important\nwork on hand which he could not leave without some preparation.  But he\nis following us and may be here at any time.\n\n'And now, we want you to help us, Lady de Lannoy.  We are not sure yet of","the identity of Mr. Robinson, but we shall know the instant we see him,\nor hear his voice.  We have learned that he is still here.  Won't you let\nus?  Do let us see him as soon as ever you can!'  There was a pleading\ntone in her voice which alone would have moved Stephen, even had she not\nbeen wrought up already by the glowing fervour of her new friend.\n\nBut she paused.  She did not know what to say; how to tell them that as\nyet she herself knew nothing.  She, too, in the depths of her own heart\nknew--_knew_--that it was the same Robinson.  And she also knew that both\r\nidentities were one with another.  The beating of her heart and the wild\nsurging of her blood told her all.  She was afraid to speak lest her\nvoice should betray her.\n\nShe could not even think.  She would have to be alone for that.\n\nMrs. Stonehouse, with the wisdom and power of age, waited, suspending\njudgment.  But Pearl was in a fever of anxiety; she could imagine nothing\nwhich could keep her away from The Man.  But she saw that there was some\ndifficulty, some cause of delay.  So she too added her pleading.  Putting\r\nher mouth close to Lady de Lannoy's ear she whispered very faintly, very\ncaressingly:\n\n'What is your name?  Your own name?  Your very own name?'\n\n'Stephen, my darling!'\n\n'Oh, won't you let us see The Man, Stephen; dear Stephen!  I love him so;\nand I do _so_ want to see him.  It is ages till I see him!  Won't you let\nme?  I shall be so good--Stephen!'  And she strained her closer in her\nlittle arms and kissed her all over face, cheeks and forehead and eyes\nand mouth wooingly.  Stephen returned the embrace and the kisses, but\r\nremained silent a little longer.  Then she found voice:\n\n'I hardly know what to say.  Believe me, I should--I shall, do all I can;\nbut the fact is that I am not in authority.  The Doctor has taken him in\ncharge and will not let anyone go near him: He will not even have a\nnurse, but watches and attends to him himself.  He says it might be fatal\nif anything should occur to agitate him.  Why, even I am not allowed to\nsee him!'\n\n'Haven't you seen him yet at all; ever, ever, Stephen?' asked Pearl, all\nher timidity gone.  Stephen smiled--a wan smile it was, as she answered:","'I saw him in the water, but it was too far away to distinguish.  And it\nwas only by firelight.'\n\n'Oh yes, I know,' said Pearl; 'Mother and Daddy told me how you had\nburned the house down to give him light.  Didn't you want to see him more\nafter that?  I should!'  Stephen drew the impulsive child closer as she\nanswered:\n\n'Indeed I did, dear.  But I had to think of what was good for him.  I\nwent to his room the next day when he was awake, and the Doctor let me\ncome in for only a moment.'\n\n'Well!  What did you see.  Didn't you know him?'  She forgot that the\r\nother did not know him from her point of view.  But the question went\nthrough Stephen's heart like a sword.  What would she not have given to\nhave known him!  What would she not give to know him now! . . . She spoke\nmechanically:\n\n'The room was quite dark.  It is necessary, the Doctor says, that he be\nkept in the dark.  I saw only a big beard, partly burned away by the\nfire; and a great bandage which covered his eyes!'  Pearl's hold relaxed,\nshe slipped like an eel to the floor and ran over to her mother.  Her new\nfriend was all very well, but no one would do as well as mother when she\r\nwas in trouble.\n\n'Oh mother, mother!  My Robinson had no beard!'  Her mother stroked her\nface comfortingly as she answered:\n\n'But, my dear, it is more than two years since you saw him.  Two years\nand three months, for it was in June that we crossed.'  How the date\nthrilled Stephen.  It verified her assumption.\n\nMrs. Stonehouse did not notice, but went on:\n\n'His beard would have grown.  Men wear beards up in the cold place where\nhe was.'  Pearl kissed her; there was no need for words.  Throwing\nherself again on Stephen's knees she went on with her questioning:\r\n'But didn't you hear him?'\n\n'I heard very little, darling.  He was very weak.  It was only the\nmorning after the wreck, and he spoke in a whisper!'  Then with an\ninstinct of self-preservation she added: 'But how could I learn anything\nby hearing him when he was a stranger to me?  I had never even heard of\nMr. Robinson!'\n\nAs she was speaking she found her own ideas, the proofs of her own\nconviction growing.  This was surely another link in the chain of proving\nthat all three men were but one.  But in such case Harold must know; must","have tried to hide his identity!\n\nShe feared, with keen eyes upon her, to pursue the thought.  But her\nblood began to grow cold and her brain to swim.  With an effort she went\non:\n\n'Even since then I have not been allowed to go near him.  Of course I\nmust obey orders.  I am waiting as patiently as I can.  But we must ask\nthe Doctor if he thinks his patient will see you--will let you see\nhim--though he will not let me.'  This she added with a touch of what she\nfelt: regret rather than bitter ness.  There was no room for bitterness\r\nin her full heart where Harold was concerned.\n\n'Will you ask the Doctor now?'  Pearl did not let grass grow under her\nfeet.  For answer Stephen rang the bell, and when a servant appeared\nasked:\n\n'Is Mr. Hilton in the house?'\n\n'I think not, your Ladyship.  He said he was going over to Port Lannoch.\nShall I inquire if he left word at what time he would be back?'\n\n'If you please!'  The man returned in a few minutes with the butler, who\nsaid:\n\n'Mr. Hilton said, your Ladyship, that he expected to be back by one\no'clock at latest.'\r\n'Please ask him on his arrival if he will kindly come here at once.  Do\nnot let us be disturbed until then.'  The butler bowed and withdrew.\n\n'Now,' said Stephen, 'as we have to wait till our tyrant comes, won't you\ntell me all that went on after The Man had left you?'  Pearl brightened\nup at once.  Stephen would have given anything to get away even for a\nwhile.  Beliefs and hopes and fears were surging up, till she felt\nchoking.  But the habit of her life, especially her life of the last two\nyears, gave her self-control.  And so she waited, trying with all her\r\nmight to follow the child's prattle.\n\nAfter a long wait Pearl exclaimed: 'Oh!  I do wish that Doctor would\ncome.  I want to see The Man!'  She was so restless, marching about the\nroom, that Stephen said:\n\n'Would you like to go out on the balcony, darling; of course if Mother\nwill let you?  It is quite safe, I assure you, Mrs. Stonehouse.  It is\nwide and open and is just above the flower-borders, with a stone tail.\nYou can see the road from it by which Mr. Hilton comes from Port Lannoch.\nHe will be riding.'  Pearl yielded at once to the diversion.  It would at","any rate be something to do, to watch.  Stephen opened the French window\nand the child ran out on the balcony.\n\nWhen Stephen came back to her seat Mrs. Stonehouse said quietly:\n\n'I am glad she is away for a few minutes.  She has been over wrought, and\nI am always afraid for her.  She is so sensitive.  And after all she is\nonly a baby!'\n\n'She is a darling!' said Stephen impulsively; and she meant it.  Mrs.\nStonehouse smiled gratefully as she went on:\n\n'I suppose you noticed what a hold on her imagination that episode of\r\nMollie Watford at the bank had.  Mr. Stonehouse is, as perhaps you know,\na very rich man.  He has made his fortune himself, and most honourably;\nand we are all very proud of him, and of it.  So Pearl does not think of\nthe money for itself.  But the feeling was everything; she really loves\nMr. Robinson; as indeed she ought!  He has done so much for us that it\nwould be a pride and a privilege for us to show our gratitude.  My\nhusband, between ourselves, wanted to make him his partner.  He tells me\nthat, quite independent of our feeling towards him, he is just the man he\r\nwanted.  And if indeed it was he who discovered the Alaskan goldfield and\norganised and ruled Robinson City, it is a proof that Mr. Stonehouse's\njudgment was sound.  Now he is injured, and blind; and our little Pearl\nloves him.  If indeed he be the man we believe he is, then we may be able\nto do something which all his millions cannot buy.  He will come to us,\nand be as a son to us, and a brother to Pearl.  We will be his eyes; and\nnothing but love and patience will guide his footsteps!'  She paused, her\nmouth quivering; then she went on:\r\n'If it is not our Mr. Robinson, then it will be our pleasure to do all\nthat is necessary for his comfort.  If he is a poor man he will never\nwant . . . It will be a privilege to save so gallant a man from hardship\n. . . '  Here she came to a stop.\n\nStephen too was glad of the pause, for the emotion which the words and\ntheir remembrances evoked was choking her.  Had not Harold been as her\nown father's son.  As her own brother! . . . She turned away, fearing\nlest her face should betray her.\n\nAll at once Mrs. Stonehouse started to her feet, her face suddenly white","with fear; for a cry had come to their ears.  A cry which even Stephen\nknew as Pearl's.  The mother ran to the window.\n\nThe balcony was empty.  She came back into the room, and, ran to the\ndoor.\n\nBut on the instant a voice that both women knew was heard from without:\n\n'Help there!  Help, I say!  The child has fainted.  Is there no one\nthere?  And I am blind!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI--LIGHT\n\n\nHarold had been in a state of increasing restlessness.  The month of\nwaiting which Dr. Hilton had laid down for him seemed to wear away with\r\nextraordinary slowness; this was increased by the lack of companionship,\nand further by the cutting off of even the little episodes usual to daily\nlife.  His patience, great as it was naturally and trained as it had been\nby the years of self-repression, was beginning to give way.  Often and\noften there came over him a wild desire to tear off the irksome bandages\nand try for himself whether the hopes held out to him were being even\npartially justified.  He was restrained only by the fear of perpetual\nblindness, which came over him in a sort of cold wave at each reaction.\r\nTime, too, added to his fear of discovery; but he could not but think\nthat his self-sought isolation must be a challenge to the curiosity of\neach and all who knew of it.  And with all these disturbing causes came\nthe main one, which never lessened but always grew: that whatever might\nhappen Stephen would be further from him than ever.  Look at the matter\nhow he would; turn it round in whatsoever possible or impossible way, he\ncould see no relief to this gloomy conclusion.\n\nFor it is in the nature of love that it creates or enlarges its own pain.\r\nIf troubles or difficulties there be from natural causes, then it will\nexaggerate them into nightmare proportions.  But if there be none, it\nwill create them.  Love is in fact the most serious thing that comes to\nman; where it exists all else seem as phantoms, or at best as actualities\nof lesser degree.  During the better part of two years his troubles had\nbut slept; and as nothing wakes the pangs of old love better than the\nsound of a voice, all the old acute pain of love and the agony that\nfollowed its denial were back with him.  Surely he could never, never","believe that Stephen did not mean what she had said to him that morning\nin the beech grove.  All his new resolution not to hamper her with the\nburden of a blind and lonely-hearted man was back to the full.\n\nIn such mood had he been that morning.  He was additionally disturbed\nbecause the Doctor had gone early to Port Lannoch; and as he was the only\nperson with whom he could talk, he clung to him with something of the\nhelpless feeling of a frightened child to its nurse.\n\nThe day being full of sunshine the window was open, and only the dark-\r\ngreen blind which crackled and rustled with every passing breeze made the\ndarkness of the room.  Harold was dressed and lay on a sofa placed back\nin the room, where the few rays of light thus entering could not reach\nhim.  His eyes and forehead were bandaged as ever.  For some days the\nDoctor, who had his own reasons and his own purpose, had not taken them\noff; so the feeling of blind helplessness was doubly upon him.  He knew\nhe was blind; and he knew also that if he were not he could not in his\npresent condition see.\r\nAll at once he started up awake.  His hearing had in the weeks of\ndarkness grown abnormally acute, and some trifling sound had recalled him\nto himself.  It might have been inspiration, but he seemed to be\nconscious of some presence in the room.\n\nAs he rose from the sofa, with the violent motion of a strong man\nstartled into unconscious activity, he sent a shock of fear to the eager\nchild who had strayed into the room through the open window.  Had he\npresented a normal appearance, she would not have been frightened.  She\r\nwould have recognised his identity despite the changes, and have sprung\nto him so impulsively that she would have been in his arms before she had\ntime to think.  But now all she saw was a great beard topped with a mass\nof linen and lint, which obscured all the rest of the face and seemed in\nthe gloom like a gigantic and ominous turban.\n\nIn her fright she screamed out.  He in turn, forgetful for the moment of\nhis intention of silence, called aloud:\n\n'Who is that?'  Pearl, who had been instinctively backing towards the\nwindow by which she had entered, and whose thoughts in her fright had","gone back to her mother--refuge in time of danger--cried out:\n\n'Mother, Mother!  It is him!  It is The Man!'  She would have run towards\nhim in spite of his forbidding appearance; but the shock had been too\nmuch for her.  The little knees trembled and gave way; the brain reeled;\nand with a moan she sank on the floor in a swoon.\n\nHarold knew the voice the instant she spoke; there was no need for the\nenlightening words\n\n'Pearl!  Pearl!' he cried.  'Come to me, darling!'  But as he spoke he\nheard her moan, and the soft thud of her little body on the thick carpet.\r\nHe guessed the truth and groped his way towards where the sound had been,\nfor he feared lest he might trample upon her in too great eagerness.\nKneeling by her he touched her little feet, and then felt his way to her\nface.  And as he did so, such is the double action of the mind, even in\nthe midst of his care the remembrance swept across his mind of how he had\nonce knelt in just such manner in an old church by another little\nsenseless form.  In his confusion of mind he lost the direction of the\ndoor, and coming to the window pushed forward the flapping blind and went\r\nout on the balcony.  He knew from the freshness of the air and the\ndistant sounds that he was in the open.  This disturbed him, as he wished\nto find someone who could attend to the fainting child.  But as he had\nlost the way back to the room now, he groped along the wall of the Castle\nwith one hand, whilst he held Pearl securely in the other.  As he went he\ncalled out for help.\n\nWhen he came opposite the window of the Mandarin room Mrs. Stonehouse saw\nhim; she ran to him and caught Pearl in her arms.  She was so agitated,\r\nso lost in concern for the child that she never even thought to speak to\nthe man whom she had come so far to seek.  She wailed over the child:\n\n'Pearl!  Pearl!  What is it, darling?  It is Mother!'  She laid the girl\non the sofa, and taking the flowers out of a glass began to sprinkle\nwater on the child's face.  Harold knew her voice and waited in patience.\nPresently the child sighed; the mother, relieved, thought of other things\nat last and looked around her.\n\nThere was yet another trouble.  There on the floor, where she had slipped","down, lay Lady de Lannoy in a swoon.  She called out instinctively,\nforgetting for the moment that the man was blind, but feeling all the old\nconfidence which he had won in her heart:\n\n'Oh!  Mr. Robinson, help me!  Lady de Lannoy has fainted too, and I do\nnot know what to do!'  As she spoke she looked up at him and remembered\nhis blindness.  But she had no time to alter her words; the instant she\nhad spoken Harold, who had been leaning against the window-sash, and\nwhose mind was calmer since with his acute hearing he too had heard Pearl\nsigh, seemed to leap into the room.\r\n'Where is she?  Where is she?  Oh, God, now am I blind indeed!'\n\nIt gave her a pang to hear him and to see him turn helplessly with his\narms and hands outstretched as though he would feel for her in the air.\n\nWithout pause, and under an instinctive and uncontrollable impulse, he\ntore the bandages from his eyes.  The sun was streaming in.  As he met it\nhis eyes blinked and a cry burst from him; a wild cry whose joy and\nsurprise pierced even through the shut portals of the swooning woman's\nbrain.  Not for worlds would she ever after have lost the memory of that\r\nsound:\n\n'Light! light!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  I am not blind!'\n\nBut he looked round him still in terrified wonder:\n\n'Where is she?  Where is she?  I cannot see her!  Stephen!  Stephen!\nwhere are you?'  Mrs. Stonehouse, bewildered, pointed where Stephen's\nsnow-white face and brilliant hair seemed in the streaming sunlight like\nivory and gold:\n\n'There!  There!'  He caught her arm mechanically, and putting his eyes to\nher wrist, tried to look along her pointed finger.  In an instant he\ndropped her arm moaning.\r\n'I cannot see her!  What is it that is over me?  This is worse than to be\nblind!'  He covered his face with his hands and sobbed.\n\nHe felt light strong fingers on his forehead and hands; fingers whose\ntouch he would have known had they been laid on him were he no longer\nquick.  A voice whose music he had heard in his dreams for two long years\nsaid softly:\n\n'I am here, Harold!  I am here!  Oh! do not sob like that; it breaks my\nheart to hear you!'  He took his hands from his face and held hers in\nthem, staring intently at her as though his passionate gaze would win","through every obstacle.\n\nThat moment he never forgot.  Never could forget!  He saw the room all\nrich in yellow.  He saw Pearl, pale but glad-eyed, lying on a sofa\nholding the hand of her mother, who stood beside her.  He saw the great\nhigh window open, the lines of the covered stone balcony without, the\nstretch of green sward all vivid in the sunshine, and beyond it the blue\nquivering sea.  He saw all but that for which his very soul longed;\nwithout to see which sight itself was valueless . . . But still he\nlooked, and looked; and Stephen saw in his dark eyes, though he could not\r\nsee her, that which made her own eyes fill and the warm red glow on her\nface again . . . Then she raised her eyes again, and the gladness of her\nbeating heart seemed the answer to his own.\n\nFor as he looked he saw, as though emerging from a mist whose obscurity\nmelted with each instant, what was to him the one face in all the world.\nHe did not think then of its beauty--that would come later; and besides\nno beauty of one born of woman could outmatch the memorised beauty which\nhad so long held his heart.  But that he had so schooled himself in long\r\nmonths of gloomy despair, he would have taken her in his arms there and\nthen; and, heedless of the presence of others, have poured out his full\nheart to her.\n\nMrs. Stonehouse saw and understood.  So too Pearl, who though a child was\na woman-child; softly they rose up to steal away.  But Stephen saw them;\nher own instincts, too, told her that her hour had not come.  What she\nhoped for must come alone!  So she called to her guests:\n\n'Don't go!  Don't go, Mrs. Stonehouse.  You know now that Harold and I\r\nare old friends, though neither of us knew it--till this moment.  We were\nbrought up as . . . almost as brother and sister.  Pearl, isn't it lovely\nto see your friend . . . to see The Man again?'\n\nShe was so happy that she could only express herself, with dignity,\nthrough the happiness of others.\n\nPearl actually shrieked with joy as she rushed across the room and flung\nherself into Harold's arms as he stooped to her.  He raised her; and she\nkissed him again and again, and put her little hands all over his face\nand stroked, very, very gently, his eyes, and said:","'Oh, I am so glad!  And so glad your poor eyes are unbind again!  May I\ncall you Harold, too?'\n\n'You darling!' was all he could say as he kissed her, and holding her in\none arm went across and shook hands with Mrs. Stonehouse, who wrung his\nhand hard.\n\nThere was a little awkwardness in the group, for none of them knew what\nwould be best to do next.  In the midst of it there came a light knock at\nthe door, and Mr. Hilton entered saying:\n\n'They told me you wished to see me at once--Hulloa!'  He rushed across\nthe room and took Harold by the shoulders, turning his face to the light.\r\nHe looked in his eyes long and earnestly, the others holding their\nbreaths.  Presently he said, without relaxing his gaze:\n\n'Did you see mistily at first?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Seeing at the periphery; but the centre being opaque?'\n\n'Yes!  How did you know?  Why, I couldn't see'--see pointing to\nStephen--'Lady de Lannoy; though her face was right in front of me!'\n\nDr. Hilton took his hands from his patient's shoulders and shook him\nwarmly by both hands:-\n\n'I am glad, old fellow!  It was worth waiting for, wasn't it?  But I say,\r\nit was a dangerous thing to take off those bandages before I permitted.\nHowever, it has done no harm!  But it was lucky that I mistrusted your\npatience and put the time for the experiment a week later than I thought\nnecessary . . . What is it?'  He turned from one to the other\nquestioningly; there was a look on Harold's face that he did not quite\ncomprehend.\n\n'H-s-h,' said the latter warningly, 'I'll tell you all about it . . .\nsome time!'\n\nThe awkward pause was broken by Pearl, who came to the Doctor and said:\n\n'I must kiss you, you know.  It was you who saved The Man's eyes.  Stephen\r\nhas told me how you watched him!'  The Doctor was somewhat taken aback;\nas yet he was ignorant of Pearl's existence.  However, he raised the\nchild in his arms and kissed her, saying:\n\n'Thank you, my dear!  I did all I could.  But he helped much himself;\nexcept at the very last.  Don't you ever go and take off bandages, if you\nshould ever have the misfortune to have them on, without the doctor's\npermission!'  Pearl nodded her head wisely and then wriggled out of his\narms and came again to Harold, looking up at him protectingly and saying","in an old-fashioned way:\n\n'How are you feeling now?  None the worse, I hope, _Harold_!'\n\nThe Man lifted her up and kissed her again.  When he set her down she\ncame over to Lady de Lannoy and held up her arms to be lifted:\n\n'And I must kiss you again too, Stephen!'  If Lady de Lannoy hadn't loved\nthe sweet little thing already she would have loved her for that!\n\nThe door was opened, and the butler announced:\n\n'Luncheon is served, your Ladyship.'\n\n* * * * *\n\nAfter a few days Harold went over to Varilands to stay for a while with\r\nthe Stonehouses.  Mr. Stonehouse had arrived, and both men were rejoiced\nto meet again.  The elder never betrayed by word or sign that he\nrecognised the identity of the other person of the drama of whom he had\ntold him and who had come so accidentally into his life; and the younger\nwas grateful to him for it.  Harold went almost every day to Lannoy, and\nsometimes the Stonehouses went with him; at other times Stephen paid\nflying visits to Varilands.  She did not make any effort to detain\nHarold; she would not for worlds have made a sign which might influence\r\nhim.  She was full now of that diffidence which every woman has who\nloves.  She felt that she must wait; must wait even if the waiting lasted\nto her grave.  She felt, as every woman does who really loves, that she\nhad found her Master.\n\nAnd Harold, to whom something of the same diffidence was an old story,\ngot the idea that her reticence was a part of the same feeling whose\nviolent expression had sent him out into the wilderness.  And with the\nthought came the idea of his duty, implied in her father's dying trust:\r\n'Give her time! . . . Let her choose!'  For him the clock seemed to have\nstopped for two whole years, and he was back at the time when the\nguardianship of his boy life was beginning to yield to the larger and\nmore selfish guardianship of manhood.\n\nStephen, noticing that he did not come near her as closely as she felt he\nmight, and not realising his true reason--for when did love ever realise\nthe true reason of the bashfulness of love?--felt a chillness which in\nturn reacted on her own manner.\n\nAnd so these two ardent souls, who yearned for each other's love and the","full expression of it, seemed as if they might end after all in drifting\napart.  Each thought that their secret was concealed.  But both secrets\nwere already known to Mrs. Stonehouse, who knew nothing; and to Mr.\nStonehouse, who knew everything.  Even Pearl had her own ideas, as was\nonce shown in a confidence when they were alone in Stephen's bedroom\nafter helping her to finish her dressing, just as Stephen herself had at\na similar age helped her Uncle Gilbert.  After some coy leading up to the\nsubject of pretty dresses, the child putting her little mouth to the\r\nother's ear whispered:\n\n'May I be your bridesmaid, Stephen?'  The woman was taken aback; but she\nhad to speak at once, for the child's eyes were on her:\n\n'Of course you will, darling.  But I--I may never be married.'\n\n'You!  You must!  I know someone who will make you!'  Stephen's heart\nbeat hard and rapidly.  The child's talk, though sweet and dear, was more\nthan embarrassing.  With, however, the desire to play with fire, which is\na part of the nature of women, she answered:\n\n'You have some queer ideas, little one, in that pretty knowledge-box of\r\nyours.'\n\n'Oh! he never told me.  But I know it all the same!  And you know it too,\nStephen!'  This was getting too close to be without danger; so she tried\nto divert the thought from herself:\n\n'My darling, you may guess about other people, though I don't say you\nought; but you must not guess about me!'\n\n'All right!' then she held up her arms to be lifted on the other's knee\nand said:\n\n'I want to whisper to you!'  Her voice and manner were so full of feeling\nthat somehow the other was moved.  She bent her head, and Pearl taking\r\nher neck in her little palms, said:\n\n'I thought, oh! long ago, that I would marry him myself.  But you knew\nhim first . . . And he only saved me . . . But you saved him!' . . . And\nthen she laid her head down on the throbbing bosom, and sobbed . . .\n\nAnd Stephen sobbed too.\n\nBefore they left the room, Stephen said to her, very gravely, for the\nissue might be one of great concern:\n\n'Of course, Pearl dear, our secrets are all between ourselves!'  Pearl\ncrossed her two forefingers and kissed them.  But she said nothing; she\nhad sworn!  Stephen went on:","'And, darling, you will remember too that one must never speak or even\nthink if they can help it about anyone's marrying anyone else till they\nsay so themselves!  What is it, dear, that you are smiling at?'\n\n'I know, Stephen!  I musn't take off the bandage till the Doctor says\nso!'\n\nStephen smiled and kissed her.  Hand in hand, Pearl chattering merrily,\nthey went down to the drawing-room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII--GOLDEN SILENCE\n\n\nEach day that passed seemed to add to the trouble in the heart of these\r\nyoung people; to widen the difficulty of expressing themselves.  To\nStephen, who had accepted the new condition of things and whose whole\nnature had bloomed again under the sunshine of hope, it was the less\nintolerable.  She had set herself to wait, as had countless thousands of\nwomen before her; and as due proportion will, till the final cataclysm\nabolishes earthly unions.  But Harold felt the growth, both positive and\nnegative, as a new torture; and he began to feel that he would be unable\nto go through with it.  In his heart was the constant struggle of hope;\r\nand in opposition to it the seeming realisation of every new fancy of\nevil.  That bitter hour, when the whole of creation was for him turned\nupside down, was having its sad effect at last.  Had it not been for that\nhorrid remembrance he would have come to believe enough in himself to put\nhis future to the test.  He would have made an opportunity at which\nStephen and himself would have with the fires of their mutual love burned\naway the encircling mist.  There are times when a single minute of\ncommonsense would turn sorrow into joy; and yet that minute, our own\r\nnatures being the opposing forces, will be allowed to pass.\n\nThose who loved these young people were much concerned about them.  Mrs.\nStonehouse took their trouble so much to heart that she spoke to her\nhusband about it, seriously advising that one or other of them should\nmake an effort to bring things in the right way for their happiness.  The\nwoman was sure of the woman's feeling.  It is from men, not women, that\nwomen hide their love.  By side-glances and unthinking moments women note\nand learn.  The man knew already, from his own lips, of the man's","passion.  But his lips were sealed by his loyalty; and he said earnestly:\n\n'My dear, we must not interfere.  Not now, at any rate; we might cause\nthem great trouble.  I am as sure as you are that they really love each\nother.  But they must win happiness by themselves and through themselves\nalone.  Otherwise it would never be to them what it ought to be; what it\nmight be; what it will be!'\n\nSo these friends were silent, and the little tragedy developed.  Harold's\npatience began to give way under the constant strain of self-suppression.\r\nStephen tried to hide her love and fear, under the mask of a gracious\ncalm.  This the other took for indifference.\n\nAt last there came an hour which was full of new, hopeless agony to\nStephen.  She heard Harold, in a fragment of conversation, speak to Mr.\nStonehouse of the need of returning to Alaska.  That sounded like a word\nof doom.  In her inmost heart she knew that Harold loved her; and had she\nbeen free she would have herself spoken the words which would have drawn\nthe full truth to them both.  But how could she do so, having the\r\nremembrance of that other episode; when, without the reality of love, she\nhad declared herself? . . . Oh! the shame of it . . . The folly! . . .\nAnd Harold knew it all!  How could he ever believe that it was real this\ntime! . . .\n\nBy the exercise of that self-restraint which long suffering had taught\nher, Stephen so managed to control herself that none of her guests\nrealised what a blow she had received from a casual word.  She bore\nherself gallantly till the last moment.  After the old fashion of her\nyouth, she had from the Castle steps seen their departure.  Then she took\r\nher way to her own room, and locked herself in.  She did not often, in\nthese days, give way to tears; when she did cry it was as a luxury, and\nnot from poignant cause.  Her deep emotion was dry-eyed as of old.  Now,\nshe did not cry, she sat still, her hands clasped below her knees, with\nset white face gazing out on the far-off sea.  For hours she sat there\nlonely; staring fixedly all the time, though her thoughts were whirling\nwildly.  At first she had some vague purpose, which she hoped might\neventually work out into a plan.  But thought would not come.  Everywhere","there was the same beginning: a wild, burning desire to let Harold\nunderstand her feeling towards him; to blot out, with the conviction of\ntrust and love, those bitter moments when in the madness of her\noverstrung passion she had heaped such insult upon him.  Everywhere the\nsame end: an impasse.  He seemingly could not, would not, understand.  She\nknew now that the man had diffidences, forbearances, self-judgments and\nself-denials which made for the suppression, in what he considered to be\nher interest, of his own desires.  This was tragedy indeed!  Again and\r\nagain came back the remembrance of that bitter regret of her Aunt\nLaetitia, which no happiness and no pain of her own had ever been able to\nefface:\n\n'To love; and be helpless!  To wait, and wait, and wait; with heart all\naflame!  To hope, and hope; till time seemed to have passed away, and all\nthe world to stand still on your hopeless misery!  To know that a word\nmight open up Heaven; and yet to have to remain mute!  To keep back the\nglances that could enlighten, to modulate the tones that might betray!  To\nsee all you hoped for passing away . . . !'\r\nAt last she seemed to understand the true force of pride; which has in it\na thousand forces of its own, positive, negative, restrainful.  Oh! how\nblind she had been!  How little she had learned from the miseries that\nthe other woman whom she loved had suffered!  How unsympathetic she had\nbeen; how self-engrossed; how callous to the sensibilities of others!  And\nnow to her, in her turn, had come the same suffering; the same galling of\nthe iron fetters of pride, and of convention which is its original\nexpression!  Must it be that the very salt of youth must lose its savour,\r\nbefore the joys of youth could be won!  What, after all, was youth if out\nof its own inherent power it must work its own destruction!  If youth was\nso, why not then trust the wisdom of age?  If youth could not act for its\nown redemption . . .\n\nHere the rudiment of a thought struck her and changed the current of her\nreason.  A thought so winged with hope that she dared not even try to\ncomplete it! . . . She thought, and thought till the long autumn shadows\nfell around her.  But the misty purpose had become real.","After dinner she went up alone to the mill.  It was late for a visit, for\nthe Silver Lady kept early hours.  But she found her friend as usual in\nher room, whose windows swept the course of the sun.  Seeing that her\nvisitor was in a state of mental disturbance such as she had once before\nexhibited, she blew out the candles and took the same seat in the eastern\nwindow she had occupied on the night which they both so well remembered.\n\nStephen understood both acts, and was grateful afresh.  The darkness\r\nwould be a help to her in what she had to say; and the resumption of the\nold seat and attitude did away with the awkwardness of new confidence.\nDuring the weeks that had passed Stephen had kept her friend informed of\nthe rescue and progress of the injured man.  Since the discovery of\nHarold's identity she had allowed her to infer her feeling towards him.\n\nShyly she had conveyed her hopes that all the bitter part of the past\nmight be wiped out.  To the woman who already knew of the love that had\nalways been, but had only awakened to consciousness in the absence of its\r\nobject, a hint was sufficient to build upon.  She had noticed the gloom\nthat had of late been creeping over the girl's happiness; and she had\nbeen much troubled about it.  But she had thought it wiser to be silent;\nshe well knew that should unhappily the time for comfort come, it must be\nprecluded by new and more explicit confidence.  So she too had been\nanxiously waiting the progress of events.  Now; as she put her arms round\nthe girl she said softly; not in the whisper which implies doubt of some\nkind, but in the soft voices which conveys sympathy and trust:\r\n'Tell me, dear child!'\n\nAnd then in broken words shyly spoken, and spoken in such a way that the\nsilences were more eloquent than the words, the girl conveyed what was in\nher heart.  The other listened, now and again stroking the beautiful\nhair.  When all was said, there was a brief pause.  The Silver Lady spoke\nno word; but the pressure of her delicate hand conveyed sympathy.\n\nIn but a half-conscious way, in words that came so shrinkingly through\nthe darkness that they hardly reached the ear bent low to catch them,\ncame Stephen's murmured thought:","'Oh, if he only knew!  And I can't tell him; I can't! dare not!  I must\nnot.  How could I dishonour him by bearing myself towards him as to that\nother . . . worthless . . . !  Oh! the happy, happy girls, who have\nmothers . . . !'  All the muscles of her body seemed to shrink and\ncollapse, till she was like an inert mass at the Silver Lady's feet.\n\nBut the other understood!\n\n After a long, long pause; when Stephen's sobbing had died away; when\neach muscle of her body had become rigid on its return to normal calm;\nthe Silver Lady began to talk of other matters, and conversation became\r\nnormal.  Stephen's courage seemed somehow to be restored, and she talked\nbrightly.\n\nBefore they parted the Silver Lady made a request.  She said in her\nnatural voice:\n\n'Couldst thou bring that gallant man who saved so many lives, and to whom\nthe Lord was so good in the restoration of his sight, to see me?  Thou\nknowest I have made a resolution not to go forth from this calm place\nwhilst I may remain.  But I should like to see him before he returns to\nthat far North where he has done such wonders.  He is evidently a man of\r\nkind heart; perhaps he will not mind coming to see a lonely woman who is\nno longer young.  There is much I should like to ask him of that land of\nwhich nothing was known in my own youth.  Perhaps he will not mind seeing\nme alone.'  Stephen's heart beat furiously.  She felt suffocating with\nnew hope, for what could be but good from Harold's meeting with that\nsweet woman who had already brought so much comfort into her own life?\nShe was abashed, and yet radiant; she seemed to tread on air as she stood\nbeside her friend saying farewell.  She did not wish to speak.  So the\r\ntwo women kissed and parted.\n\nIt had been arranged that two days hence the Stonehouse party were to\nspend the day at Lannoy, coming before lunch and staying the night, as\nthey wanted in the afternoon to return a visit at some distance to the\nnorth of Lannoy.  Harold was to ride over with them.\n\nWhen the Varilands party arrived, Stephen told them of Sister Ruth's wish\nto see Harold.  Pearl at once proffered a request that she also should be\ntaken at some other time to see the Silver Lady.  Harold acquiesced","heartily; and it was agreed that some time in the late afternoon he\nshould pay the visit.  Stephen would bring him.\n\nStrangely enough, she felt no awkwardness, no trepidation, as they rode\nup the steep road to the Mill.\n\nWhen the introduction had been effected, and half an hour had been\nconsumed in conventional small talk, Stephen, obedience to a look from\nthe Silver Lady, rose.  She said in they most natural way she could:\n\n'Now Sister Ruth, I will leave you two alone, if you do not mind.  Harold\ncan tell you all you want to know about Alaska; and perhaps, if you are\r\nvery good, he will tell some of his adventures!  Good afternoon, dear.  I\nwish you were to be with us to-night; but I know your rule.  I go for my\nride.  Sultan has had no exercise for five days; and he looked at me\nquite reproachfully when we met this morning.  Au revoir, Harold.  We\nshall meet at dinner!'\n\nWhen she had gone Harold came back from the door, and stood in the window\nlooking east.  The Silver Lady came and stood beside him.  She did not\nseem to notice his face, but in the mysterious way of women she watched\r\nhim keenly.  She wished to satisfy her own mind before she undertook her\nself-appointed task.\n\n Her eyes were turned towards the headland towards which Stephen on her\nwhite Arab was galloping at breakneck speed.  He was too good a horseman\nhimself, and he knew her prowess on horseback too well to have any\nanxiety regarding such a rider at Stephen.  It was not fear, then, that\nmade his face so white, and his eyes to have such an illimitable sadness.\n\nThe Silver Lady made up her mind.  All her instincts were to trust him.\r\nShe recognised a noble nature, with which truth would be her surest\nforce.\n\n'Come,' she said, 'sit here, friend; where another friend has often sat\nwith me.  From this you can see all the coastline, and all that thou\nwilt!'  Harold put a chair beside the one she pointed out; and when she\nwas seated he sat also.  She began at once with a desperate courage:\n\n'I have wanted much to see thee.  I have heard much of thee, before thy\ncoming.'  There was something in the tone of her voice which arrested his\nattention, and he looked keenly at her.  Here, in the full light, her","face looked sadly white and he noticed that her lips trembled.  He said\nwith all the kindliness of his nature, for from the first moment he had\nseen her he had taken to her, her purity and earnestness and sweetness\nappealing to some aspiration within him:\n\n'You are pale!  I fear you are not well!  May I call your maid?  Can I do\nanything for you?'  She waved her hand gently:\n\n'Nay!  It is nothing.  It is but the result of a sleepless night and much\nthought.'\n\n'Oh!  I wish I had known!  I could have put off my visit; and I could\r\nhave come any other time to suit you.'  She smiled gently:\n\n'I fear that would have availed but little.  It was of thy coming that I\nwas concerned.'  Seeing his look of amazement, she went on quickly, her\nvoice becoming more steady as she lost sight of herself in her task:\n\n'Be patient a little with me.  I am an old woman; and until recently it\nhas been many and many years since the calm which I sought here has been\nruffled.  I had come to believe that for me earthly troubles were no\nmore.  But there has come into my life a new concern.  I have heard so\r\nmuch of thee, and before thy coming.'  The recurrence of the phrase\nstruck him.  He would have asked how such could be, but he deemed it\nbetter to wait.  She went on:\n\n'I have been wishful to ask thy advice.  But why should not I tell thee\noutright that which troubles me?  I am not used, at least for these many\nyears, to dissemble.  I can but trust thee in all; and lean on thy man's\nmercy to understand, and to aid me!'\n\n'I shall do all in my power, believe me!' said Harold simply.  'Speak\nfreely!'  She pointed out of the window, where Stephen's white horse\r\nseemed on the mighty sweep of green sward like a little dot.\n\n'It is of her that I would speak to thee!'  Harold's heart began to beat\nhard; he felt that something was coming.  The Silver Lady went on:\n\n'Why thinkest thou that she rideth at such speed?  It is her habit!'  He\nwaited.  She continued:\n\n'Doth it not seem to thee that such reckless movement is the result of\nmuch trouble; that she seeketh forgetfulness?'  He knew that she was\nspeaking truly; and somehow the conviction was borne upon him that she\nknew his secret heart, and was appealing to it.  If it was about Stephen!","If her disquiet was about her; then God bless her!  He would be patient\nand grateful.  The Quaker's voice seemed to come through his thought, as\nthough she had continued speaking whilst he had paused:\n\n'We have all our own secrets.  I have had mine; and I doubt not that thou\nhast had, may still have, thine own.  Stephen hath hers!  May I speak to\nthee of her?'\n\n'I shall be proud!  Oh! madam, I thank you with all my heart for your\nsweet kindness to her.  I cannot say what I feel; for she has always been\r\nvery dear to me!'  In the pause before she spoke again the beating of his\nown heart seemed to re-echo the quick sounds of Stephen's galloping\nhorse.  He was surprised at the method of her speech when it did come;\nfor she forgot her Quaker idiom, and spoke in the phrasing of her youth:\n\n'Do you love her still?'\n\n'With all my soul!  More than ever!'\n\n'Then, God be thanked; for it is in your power to do much good.  To\nrescue a poor, human, grieving soul from despair!'  Her words conveyed\njoy greater than she knew.  Harold did not himself know why the air\r\nseemed filled with sounds that seemed to answer every doubt of his life.\nHe felt, understood, with that understanding which is quicker than\nthought.  The Silver Lady went on now with a rush:\n\n'See, I have trusted you indeed!  I have given away another woman's\nsecret; but I do it without fear.  I can see that you also are troubled;\nand when I look back on my own life and remember the trouble that sent me\nout of the world; a lonely recluse here in this spot far from the stress\nof life, I rejoice that any act of mine can save such another tragedy as\r\nmy own.  I see that I need not go into detail.  You know that I am\nspeaking truth.  It was before you came so heroically on this new scene\nthat she told me her secret.  At a time when nothing was known of you\nexcept that you had disappeared.  When she laid bare her poor bleeding\nheart to me, she did it in such wise that for an instant I feared that it\nwas a murder which she had committed.  Indeed, she called it so!  You\nunderstand that I know all your secret; all her part in it at least.  And\nI know that you understand what loving duty lies before you.  I see it in","your eyes; your brave, true eyes!  Go! and the Lord be with thee!'  Her\naccustomed idiom had returned with prayer.  She turned her head away,\nand, standing up, leaned against the window.  Bending over, he took her\nhand and said simply:\n\n'God bless you!  I shall come back to thank you either to-night or to-\nmorrow; and I hope that she will be with me.'\n\nHe went quickly out of the room.  The woman stood for long looking out of\nthe window, and following with tear-dimmed eyes the movement of his great\nblack horse as he swept across country straight as the crow flies,\r\ntowards the headland whither Stephen had gone.\n\n* * * * *\n\nStephen passed over the wide expanse without thought; certainly without\nmemory of it.  Never in her after-life could she recall any thought that\nhad passed through her mind from the time she left the open gate of the\nwindmill yard till she pulled up her smoking, panting horse beside the\nruin of the fisher's house.\n\nStephen was not unhappy!  She was not happy in any conscious form.  She\nwas satisfied rather than dissatisfied.  She was a woman!  A woman who\r\nwaited the coming of a man!\n\nFor a while she stood at the edge of the cliff, and looked at the turmoil\nof the tide churning on the rocks below.  Her heart went out in a great\nburst of thankfulness that it was her hand which had been privileged to\naid in rescuing so dear a life.  Then she looked around her.  Ostensibly\nit was to survey the ruined house; but in reality to search, even then\nunder her lashes, the whole green expanse sloping up to the windmill for\nsome moving figure.  She saw that which made her throat swell and her\r\nears to hear celestial music.  But she would not allow herself to think,\nof that at all events.  She was all woman now; all-patient, and\nall-submissive.  She waited the man; and the man was coming!\n\nFor a few minutes she walked round the house as though looking at it\ncritically for some after-purpose.  After the wreck Stephen had suggested\nto Trinity House that there should be a lighthouse on the point; and\noffered to bear the expense of building it.  She was awaiting the answer\nof the Brethren; and of course nothing would be done in clearing the","ground for any purpose till the answer had come.  She felt now that if\nthat reply was negative, she would herself build there a pleasure-house\nof her own.\n\nThen she went to the edge of the cliff, and went down the zigzag by which\nthe man and horse had gone to their gallant task.  At the edge of the\nflat rock she sat and thought.\n\nAnd through all her thoughts passed the rider who even now was thundering\nover the green sward on his way to her.  In her fancy at first, and later\nin her ears, she could hear the sound of his sweeping gallop.\r\nIt was thus that a man should come to a woman!\n\nShe had no doubts now.  Her quietude was a hymn of grateful praise!\n\nThe sound stopped.  With all her ears she listened, her heart now\nbeginning to beat furiously.  The sea before her, all lines and furrows\nwith the passing tide, was dark under the shadow of the cliff; and the\nedge of the shadow was marked with the golden hue of sunset.\n\nAnd then she saw suddenly a pillar of shadow beyond the line of the\ncliff.  It rested but a moment, moved swiftly along the edge, and then\nwas lost to her eyes.\r\nBut to another sense there was greater comfort: she heard the clatter of\nrolling pebbles and the scramble of eager feet.  Harold was hastening\ndown the zigzag.\n\nOh! the music of that sound!  It woke all the finer instincts of the\nwoman.  All the dross and thought of self passed away.  Nature, sweet and\nsimple and true, reigned alone.  Instinctively she rose and came towards\nhim.  In the simple nobility of her self-surrender and her purpose, which\nwere at one with the grandeur of nature around her, to be negative was to\nbe false.\n\nSince he had spoken with the Silver Lady Harold had swept through the\r\nair; the rush of his foaming horse over the sward had been but a slow\nphysical progress, which mocked the on-sweep of his mind.  In is rapid\nride he too had been finding himself.  By the reading of his own soul he\nknew now that love needs a voice; that a man's love, to be welcomed to\nthe full, should be dominant and self-believing.\n\nWhen the two saw each other's eyes there was no need for words.  Harold\ncame close, opening wide his arms, Stephen flew to them.\n\nIn that divine moment, when their mouths met, both knew that their souls\nwere one."],"NormalizedText":"start of the project

a moments reflection  thats a fine idea in the\r\nabstract but i doubt of its happiness in the longrun\r\n\r\ndoubt of its happiness  come now what could there be better after\r\nall  isnt it good enough to be god  what more do you want\r\n\r\nthe girls tone was quizzical but her great black eyes blazed with some\r\nthought of sincerity which lay behind the fun  the young man shook his\r\nhead with a smile of kindly tolerance as he answered\r\n\r\nit isnt thatsurely you must know it  im ambitious enough goodness\r\nknows but there are bounds to satisfy even me  but im not sure that\r\nthe good little thing isnt right  she seemed somehow to hit a bigger\r\ntruth than she knew fancy having to be just\r\n\r\ni dont see much difficulty in that  anyone can be just\r\n\r\npardon me he answered there is perhaps nothing so difficult in the\r\nwhole range of a mans work  there was distinct defiance in the girls\r\neyes as she asked\r\n\r\na mans work  why a mans work  isnt it a womans work also\r\n\r\nwell i suppose it ought to be theoretically practically it isnt\r\n\r\nand why not pray  the mere suggestion of any disability of woman as\r\nsuch aroused immediate antagonism  her companion suppressed a smile as\r\nhe answered deliberately\r\n\r\nbecause my dear stephen the almighty has ordained that justice is not\r\na virtue women can practise  mind i do not say women are unjust  far\r\nfrom it where there are no interests of those dear to them they can be\r\nof a sincerity of justice that can make a mans blood run cold  but\r\njustice in the abstract is not an ordinary virtue it has to be\r\nconsiderate as well as stern and above all interest of all kinds and of\r\nevery one  the girl interrupted hotly\r\n\r\ni dont agree with you at all  you cant give an instance where women\r\nare unjust  i dont mean of course individual instances but classes of\r\ncases where injustice is habitual  the suppressed smile cropped out now\r\nunconsciously round the mans lips in a way which was intensely\r\naggravating to the girl\r\n\r\nill give you a few he said  did you ever know a mother just to a\r\nboy who beat her own boy at school  the girl replied quietly\r\n\r\nilltreatment and bullying are subjects for punishment not justice\r\n\r\noh i dont mean that kind of beating  i mean getting the prizes their\r\nown boys contended for getting above them in class showing superior\r\npowers in running or cricket or swimming or in any of the forms of\r\neffort in which boys vie with each other  the girl reflected then she\r\nspoke\r\n\r\nwell you may be right  i dont altogether admit it but i accept it as\r\nnot on my side  but this is only one case\r\n\r\na pretty common one  do you think that sheriff of galway who in\r\ndefault of a hangman hanged his son with his own hands would have done\r\nso if he had been a woman  the girl answered at once\r\n\r\nfrankly no  i dont suppose the mother was ever born who would do such\r\na thing  but that is not a common case is it  have you any other  the\r\nyoung man paused before he spoke\r\n\r\nthere is another but i dont think i can go into it fairly with you\r\n\r\nwhy not\r\n\r\nwell because after all you know stephen you are only a girl and you\r\ncant be expected to know  the girl laughed\r\n\r\nwell if its anything about women surely a girl even of my tender age\r\nmust know something more of it or be able to guess at than any young\r\nman can  however say what you think and ill tell you frankly if i\r\nagreethat is if a woman can be just in such a matter\r\n\r\nshortly the point is this can a woman be just to another woman or to a\r\nman for the matter of that where either her own affection or a fault of\r\nthe other is concerned\r\n\r\ni dont see any reason to the contrary  surely pride alone should\r\nensure justice in the former case and the consciousness of superiority\r\nin the other  the young man shook his head\r\n\r\npride and the consciousness of superiority  are they not much the same\r\nthing  but whether or no if either of them has to be relied on im\r\nafraid the scales of justice would want regulating and her sword should\r\nbe blunted in case its edge should be turned back on herself  i have an\r\nidea that although pride might be a guiding principle with you\r\nindividually it would be a failure with the average  however as it\r\nwould be in any case a rule subject to many exceptions i must let it go\r\n\r\nharold looked at his watch and rose  stephen followed him transferring\r\nher whip into the hand which held up the skirt she took his arm with her\r\nright hand in the pretty way in which a young girl clings to her elders\r\ntogether they went out at the lichgate  the groom drew over with the\r\nhorses  stephen patted hers and gave her a lump of sugar  then putting\r\nher foot into harolds ready hand she sprang lightly into the saddle\r\nharold swung himself into his saddle with the dexterity of an\r\naccomplished rider\r\n\r\nas the two rode up the road keeping on the shady side under the trees\r\nstephen said quietly half to herself as if the sentence had impressed\r\nitself on her mind\r\n\r\nto be god and able to do things\r\n\r\nharold rode on in silence  the chill of some vague fear was upon him\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter istephen\r\n\r\n\r\nstephen norman of normanstand had remained a bachelor until close on\r\nmiddle age when the fact took hold of him that there was no immediate\r\nheir to his great estate  whereupon with his wonted decision he set\r\nabout looking for a wife\r\n\r\nhe had been a close friend of his next neighbour squire rowly ever\r\nsince their college days  they had of course been often in each\r\nothers houses and rowlys young sisteralmost a generation younger\r\nthan himself and the sole fruit of his fathers second marriagehad\r\nbeen like a little sister to him too  she had in the twenty years which\r\nhad elapsed grown to be a sweet and beautiful young woman  in all the\r\npast years with the constant opportunity which friendship gave of close\r\ncompanionship the feeling never altered  squire norman would have been\r\nsurprised had he been asked to describe margaret rowly and found himself\r\ncompelled to present the picture of a woman not a child\r\n\r\nnow however when his thoughts went womanward and wifeward he awoke to\r\nthe fact that margaret came within the category of those he sought  his\r\nusual decision ran its course  semibrotherly feeling gave place to a\r\nstronger and perhaps more selfish feeling  before he even knew it he\r\nwas head over ears in love with his pretty neighbour\r\n\r\nnorman was a fine man stalwart and handsome his forty years sat so\r\nlightly on him that his age never seemed to come into question in a\r\nwomans mind  margaret had always liked him and trusted him he was the\r\nbig brother who had no duty in the way of scolding to do  his presence\r\nhad always been a gladness and the sex of the girl first unconsciously\r\nthen consciously answered to the mans overtures and her consent was\r\nsoon obtained\r\n\r\nwhen in the fulness of time it was known that an heir was expected\r\nsquire norman took for granted that the child would be a boy and held\r\nthe idea so tenaciously that his wife who loved him deeply gave up\r\nwarning and remonstrance after she had once tried to caution him against\r\ntoo fond a hope  she saw how bitterly he would be disappointed in case\r\nit should prove to be a girl  he was however so fixed on the point\r\nthat she determined to say no more  after all it might be a boy the\r\nchances were equal  the squire would not listen to any one else at all\r\nso as the time went on his idea was more firmly fixed than ever  his\r\narrangements were made on the base that he would have a son  the name\r\nwas of course decided  stephen had been the name of all the squires of\r\nnormanstand for agesas far back as the records went and stephen the\r\nnew heir of course would be\r\n\r\nlike all middleaged men with young wives he was supremely anxious as the\r\ntime drew near  in his anxiety for his wife his belief in the son became\r\npassive rather than active  indeed the idea of a son was so deeply\r\nfixed in his mind that it was not disturbed even by his anxiety for the\r\nyoung wife he idolised\r\n\r\nwhen instead of a son a daughter was born the doctor and the nurse who\r\nknew his views on the subject held back from the mother for a little the\r\nknowledge of the sex  dame norman was so weak that the doctor feared\r\nlest anxiety as to how her husband would bear the disappointment might\r\nmilitate against her  therefore the doctor sought the squire in his\r\nstudy and went resolutely at his task\r\n\r\nwell squire i congratulate you on the birth of your child  norman\r\nwas of course struck with the use of the word child but the cause of\r\nhis anxiety was manifested by his first question\r\n\r\nhow is she doctor  is she safe  the child was after all of secondary\r\nimportance  the doctor breathed more freely the question had lightened\r\nhis task  there was therefore more assurance in his voice as he\r\nanswered\r\n\r\nshe is safely through the worst of her trouble but i am greatly anxious\r\nyet  she is very weak  i fear anything that might upset her\r\n\r\nthe squires voice came quick and strong\r\n\r\nthere must be no upset  and now tell me about my son  he spoke the\r\nlast word half with pride half bashfully\r\n\r\nyour son is a daughter  there was silence for so long that the doctor\r\nbegan to be anxious  squire norman sat quite still his right hand\r\nresting on the writingtable before him became clenched so hard that the\r\nknuckles looked white and the veins red  after a long slow breath he\r\nspoke\r\n\r\nshe my daughter is well  the doctor answered with cheerful alacrity\r\n\r\nsplendidi never saw a finer child in my life  she will be a comfort\r\nand an honour to you  the squire spoke again\r\n\r\nwhat does her mother think  i suppose shes very proud of her\r\n\r\nshe does not know yet that it is a girl  i thought it better not to let\r\nher know till i had told you\r\n\r\nwhy\r\n\r\nbecausebecausenorman old friend you know why  because you had set\r\nyour heart on a son and i know how it would grieve that sweet young wife\r\nand mother to feel your disappointment  i want your lips to be the first\r\nto tell her so that on may assure her of your happiness in that a\r\ndaughter has been born to you\r\n\r\nthe squire put out his great hand and laid it on the others shoulder\r\nthere was almost a break in his voice as he said\r\n\r\nthank you my old friend my true friend for your thought  when may i\r\nsee her\r\n\r\nby right not yet  but as knowing your views she may fret herself\r\ntill she knows i think you had better come at once\r\n\r\nall normans love and strength combined for his task  as he leant over\r\nand kissed his young wife there was real fervour in his voice as he said\r\n\r\nwhere is my dear daughter that you may place her in my arms  for an\r\ninstant there came a chill to the mothers heart that her hopes had been\r\nso far disappointed but then came the reaction of her joy that her\r\nhusband her babys father was pleased  there was a heavenly dawn of\r\nred on her pale face as she drew her husbands head down and kissed him\r\n\r\noh my dear she said i am so happy that you are pleased  the nurse\r\ntook the mothers hand gently and held it to the baby as she laid it in\r\nthe fathers arms\r\n\r\nhe held the mothers hand as he kissed the babys brow\r\n\r\nthe doctor touched him gently on the arm and beckoned him away  he went\r\nwith careful footsteps looking behind as he went\r\n\r\nafter dinner he talked with the doctor on various matters but presently\r\nhe asked\r\n\r\ni suppose doctor it is no sort of rule that the first child regulates\r\nthe sex of a family\r\n\r\nno of course not  otherwise how should we see boys and girls mixed in\r\none family as is nearly always the case  but my friend he went on\r\nyou must not build hopes so far away  i have to tell you that your wife\r\nis far from strong  even now she is not so well as i could wish and\r\nthere yet may be change  the squire leaped impetuously to his feet as\r\nhe spoke quickly\r\n\r\nthen why are we waiting here  can nothing be done  let us have the\r\nbest help the best advice in the world  the doctor raised his hand\r\n\r\nnothing can be done as yet  i have only fear\r\n\r\nthen let us be ready in case your fears should be justified  who are\r\nthe best men in london to help in such a case  the doctor mentioned two\r\nnames and within a few minutes a mounted messenger was galloping to\r\nnorcester the nearest telegraph centre  the messenger was to arrange\r\nfor a special train if necessary  shortly afterwards the doctor went\r\nagain to see his patient  after a long absence he came back pale and\r\nagitated  norman felt his heart sink when he saw him a groan broke from\r\nhim as the doctor spoke\r\n\r\nshe is much worse  i am in great fear that she may pass away before the\r\nmorning  the squires strong voice was clouded with a hoarse veil as\r\nhe asked\r\n\r\nmay i see her\r\n\r\nnot yet at present she is sleeping  she may wake strengthened in\r\nwhich case you may see her  but if not\r\n\r\nif notthe voice was not like his own\r\n\r\nthen i shall send for you at once  the doctor returned to his vigil\r\nthe squire left alone sank on his knees his face in his hands his\r\ngreat shoulders shook with the intensity of his grief\r\n\r\nan hour or more passed before he heard hurried steps  he sprang to the\r\ndoor\r\n\r\nwell\r\n\r\nyou had better come now\r\n\r\nis she better\r\n\r\nalas no  i fear her minutes are numbered  school yourself my dear\r\nold friend  god will help you in this bitter hour  all you can do now\r\nis to make her last moments happy\r\n\r\ni know  i know he answered in a voice so calm that his companion\r\nwondered\r\n\r\nwhen they came into the room margaret was dozing  when her eyes opened\r\nand she found her husband beside her bed there spread over her face a\r\nglad look which alas soon changed to one of pain  she motioned to him\r\nto bend down  he knelt and put his head beside her on the pillow his\r\narms went tenderly round her as though by his iron devotion and strength\r\nhe would shield her from all harm  her voice came very low and in broken\r\ngasps she was summoning all her strength that she might speak\r\n\r\nmy dear dear husband i am so sad at leaving you  you have made me so\r\nhappy and i love you so  forgive me dear for the pain i know you will\r\nsuffer when i am gone  and oh stephen i know you will cherish our\r\nlittle oneyours and minewhen i am gone  she will have no mother you\r\nwill have to be father and mother too\r\n\r\ni will hold her in my very hearts core my darling as i hold you  he\r\ncould hardly speak from emotion  she went on\r\n\r\nand oh my dear you will not grieve that she is not a son to carry on\r\nyour name  and then a sudden light came into her eyes and there was\r\nexultation in her weak voice as she said\r\n\r\nshe is to be our only one let her be indeed our son  call her the name\r\nwe both love  for answer he rose and laid his hand very very tenderly\r\non the babe as he said\r\n\r\nthis dear one my sweet wife who will carry your soul in her breast\r\nwill be my son the only son i shall ever have  all my life long i\r\nshall please almighty god so love herour little stephenas you and i\r\nlove each other\r\n\r\nshe laid her hand on his so that it touched at once her husband and her\r\nchild  then she raised the other weak arm and placed it round his neck\r\nand their lips met  her soul went out in this last kiss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter iithe heart of a child\r\n\r\n\r\nfor some weeks after his wifes death squire norman was overwhelmed with\r\ngrief  he made a brave effort however to go through the routine of his\r\nlife and succeeded so far that he preserved an external appearance of\r\nbearing his loss with resignation  but within all was desolation\r\n\r\nlittle stephen had winning ways which sent deep roots into her fathers\r\nheart  the little bundle of nerves which the father took into his arms\r\nmust have realised with all its senses that in all that it saw and heard\r\nand touched there was nothing but love and help and protection\r\ngradually the trust was followed by expectation  if by some chance the\r\nfather was late in coming to the nursery the child would grow impatient\r\nand cast persistent longing glances at the door  when he came all was\r\njoy\r\n\r\ntime went quickly by and norman was only recalled to its passing by the\r\ngrowth of his child  seedtime and harvest the many comings of natures\r\ngrowth were such commonplaces to him and had been for so many years\r\nthat they made on him no impressions of comparison  but his baby was one\r\nand one only  any change in it was not only in itself a new experience\r\nbut brought into juxtaposition what is with what was  the changes that\r\nbegan to mark the divergence of sex were positive shocks to him for they\r\nwere unexpected  in the very dawn of babyhood dress had no special\r\nimport to his masculine eyes sex was lost in youth  but little by\r\nlittle came the tiny changes which convention has established  and with\r\neach change came to squire norman the growing realisation that his child\r\nwas a woman  a tiny woman it is true and requiring more care and\r\nprotection and devotion than a bigger one but still a woman  the pretty\r\nlittle ways the eager caresses the graspings and holdings of the\r\nchildish hands the little roguish smiles and pantings and flirtings were\r\nall but repetitions in little of the dalliance of long ago  the father\r\nafter all reads in the same book in which the lover found his knowledge\r\n\r\nat first there was through all his love for his child a certain\r\nresentment of her sex  his old hope of a son had been rooted too deeply\r\nto give way easily  but when the conviction came and with it the habit\r\nof its acknowledgment there came also a certain resignation which is\r\nthe haltingplace for satisfaction  but he never not then nor\r\nafterwards quite lost the old belief that stephen was indeed a son\r\ncould there ever have been a doubt the remembrance of his wifes eyes\r\nand of her faint voice of her hope and her faith as she placed her baby\r\nin his arms would have refused it a restingplace  this belief tinged\r\nall his afterlife and moulded his policy with regard to his girls\r\nupbringing  if she was to be indeed his son as well as his daughter she\r\nmust from the first be accustomed to boyish as well as to girlish ways\r\nthis in that she was an only child was not a difficult matter to\r\naccomplish  had she had brothers and sisters matters of her sex would\r\nsoon have found their own level\r\n\r\nthere was one person who objected strongly to any deviation from the\r\nconventional rule of a girls education  this was miss laetitia rowly\r\nwho took after a time in so far as such a place could be taken that of\r\nthe childs mother  laetitia rowly was a young aunt of squire rowly of\r\nnorwood the younger sister of his father and some sixteen years his own\r\nsenior  when the old squires second wife had died laetitia then a\r\nconceded spinster of thirtysix had taken possession of the young\r\nmargaret  when margaret had married squire norman miss rowly was well\r\nsatisfied for she had known stephen norman all her life  though she\r\ncould have wished a younger bridegroom for her darling she knew it would\r\nbe hard to get a better man or one of more suitable station in life  also\r\nshe knew that margaret loved him and the woman who had never found the\r\nhappiness of mutual love in her own life found a pleasure in the romance\r\nof true love even when the wooer was middleaged  she had been\r\ntravelling in the far east when the belated news of margarets death came\r\nto her  when she had arrived home she announced her intention of taking\r\ncare of margarets child just as she had taken care of margaret  for\r\nseveral reasons this could not be done in the same way  she was not old\r\nenough to go and live at normanstand without exciting comment and the\r\nsquire absolutely refused to allow that his daughter should live anywhere\r\nexcept in his own house  educational supervision exercised at such\r\ndistance and so intermittently could neither be complete nor exact\r\n\r\nthough stephen was a sweet child she was a wilful one and very early in\r\nlife manifested a dominant nature  this was a secret pleasure to her\r\nfather who never losing sight of his old idea that she was both son and\r\ndaughter took pleasure as well as pride out of each manifestation of her\r\nimperial will  the keen instinct of childhood which reasons in feminine\r\nfashion and is therefore doubly effective in a womanchild early\r\ngrasped the possibilities of her own will  she learned the measure of\r\nher nurses foot and then of her fathers and so knowing where lay the\r\nbounds of possibility of the achievement of her wishes she at once\r\navoided trouble and learned how to make the most of the space within the\r\nlimit of her tether\r\n\r\nit is not those who cry for the moon who go furthest or get most in\r\nthis limited world of ours  stephens pretty ways and unfailing good\r\ntemper were a perpetual joy to her father and when he found that as a\r\nrule her desires were reasonable his wish to yield to them became a\r\nhabit\r\n\r\nmiss rowly seldom saw any individual thing to disapprove of  she it was\r\nwho selected the governesses and who interviewed them from time to time\r\nas to the childs progress  not often was there any complaint for the\r\nlittle thing had such a pretty way of showing affection and such a\r\nmanifest sense of justified trust in all whom she encountered that it\r\nwould have been hard to name a specific fault\r\n\r\nbut though all went in tears of affectionate regret and with eminently\r\nsatisfactory emoluments and references there came an irregularly timed\r\nsuccession of governesses\r\n\r\nstephens affection for her auntie was never affected by any of the\r\nchanges  others might come and go but there no change came  the\r\nchilds little hand would steal into one of the old ladys strong ones\r\nor would clasp a finger and hold it tight  and then the woman who had\r\nnever had a child of her own would feel afresh each time as though the\r\nchilds hand was gripping her heart\r\n\r\nwith her father she was sweetest of all  and as he seemed to be pleased\r\nwhen she did anything like a little boy the habit of being like one\r\ninsensibly grew on her\r\n\r\nan only child has certain educational difficulties  the true learning is\r\nnot that which we are taught but that which we take in for ourselves\r\nfrom experience and observation and childrens experiences and\r\nobservation especially of things other than repressive are mainly of\r\nchildren  the little ones teach each other  brothers and sisters are\r\nmore with each other than are ordinary playmates and in the familiarity\r\nof their constant intercourse some of the great lessons so useful in\r\nafterlife are learned  little stephen had no means of learning the\r\nwisdom of giveandtake  to her everything was given given bountifully\r\nand gracefully  graceful acceptance of good things came to her\r\nnaturally as it does to one who is born to be a great lady  the\r\nchildren of the farmers in the neighbourhood with whom at times she\r\nplayed were in such habitual awe of the great house that they were\r\nseldom sufficiently at ease to play naturally  children cannot be on\r\nequal terms on special occasions with a person to whom they have been\r\ntaught to bow or courtesy as a public habit  the children of\r\nneighbouring landowners who were few and far between and of the\r\nprofessional people in norcester were at such times as stephen met them\r\ngenerally so much on their good behaviour that the spontaneity of play\r\nthrough which it is that sharp corners of individuality are knocked off\r\nor worn down did not exist\r\n\r\nand so stephen learned to read in the book of life though only on one\r\nside of it  at the age of six she had though surrounded with loving\r\ncare and instructed by skilled teachers learned only the accepting side\r\nof life  giving of course there was in plenty for the traditions of\r\nnormanstand were royally benevolent many a blessing followed the little\r\nmaids footsteps as she accompanied some timely aid to the sick and needy\r\nsent from the squires house  moreover her aunt tried to inculcate\r\ncertain maxims founded on that noble one that it is more blessed to give\r\nthan to receive  but of giving in its true sense the giving that which\r\nwe want for ourselves the giving that is as a temple built on the rock\r\nof selfsacrifice she knew nothing  her sweet and spontaneous nature\r\nwhich gave its love and sympathy so readily was almost a bar to\r\neducation it blinded the eyes that would have otherwise seen any defect\r\nthat wanted altering any evil trait that needed repression any lagging\r\nvirtue that required encouragementor the spur\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter iiiharold\r\n\r\n\r\nsquire norman had a clerical friend whose rectory of carstone lay some\r\nthirty miles from normanstand  thirty miles is not a great distance for\r\nrailway travel but it is a long drive  the days had not come nor were\r\nthey ever likely to come for the making of a railway between the two\r\nplaces  for a good many years the two men had met in renewal of their\r\nold university days  squire norman and dr an wolf had been chums at\r\ntrinity cambridge and the boyish friendship had ripened and lasted\r\nwhen harold an wolf had put in his novitiate in a teeming midland\r\nmanufacturing town it was normans influence which obtained the\r\nrectorship for his friend  it was not often that they could meet for an\r\nwolfs work which though not very exacting had to be done\r\nsinglehanded kept him to his post  besides he was a good scholar and\r\neked out a small income by preparing a few pupils for public school  an\r\noccasional midweek visit to normanstand in the slack time of school work\r\non the doctors part and now and again a drive by norman over to the\r\nrectory returning the next day had been for a good many years the\r\nmeasure of their meeting  then an wolfs marriage and the birth of a son\r\nhad kept him closer to home  mrs an wolf had been killed in a railway\r\naccident a couple of years after her only child had been born and at the\r\ntime norman had gone over to render any assistance in his power to the\r\nafflicted man and to give him what was under the circumstances his best\r\ngift sympathy  after an interval of a few years the squires courtship\r\nand marriage at which his old friend had assisted had confined his\r\nactivities to a narrower circle  the last time they had met was when an\r\nwolf had come over to norcester to aid in the burial of his friends\r\nwife  in the process of years however the shadow over normans life\r\nhad begun to soften when his baby had grown to be something of a\r\ncompanion they met again  norman who had never since his wifes death\r\nbeen able to tear himself even for a night away from normanstand and\r\nstephen wrote to his old friend asking him to come to him  an wolf\r\ngladly promised and for a week of growing expectation the squire looked\r\nforward to their meeting  each found the other somewhat changed in all\r\nbut their old affection\r\n\r\nan wolf was delighted with the little stephen  her dainty beauty seemed\r\nto charm him and the child seeming to realise what pleasure she was\r\ngiving exercised all her little winning ways  the rector who knew more\r\nof children than did his friend told her as she sat on his knee of a\r\nvery interesting person his own son  the child listened interested at\r\nfirst then enraptured  she asked all kinds of questions and the\r\nfathers eyes brightened as he gladly answered the pretty sympathetic\r\nchild already deep in his heart for her fathers sake  he told her\r\nabout the boy who was so big and strong and who could run and leap and\r\nswim and play cricket and football better than any other boy with whom he\r\nplayed  when warmed himself by the keen interest of the little girl\r\nand seeing her beautiful black eyes beginning to glow he too woke to the\r\nglory of the time and all the treasured moments of the fathers lonely\r\nheart gave out their store  and the other father thrilled with delight\r\nbecause of his babys joy with underlying all an added pleasure that\r\nthe little stephens interest was in sports that were for boys looked on\r\napprovingly now and again asking questions himself in furtherance of the\r\nchilds wishes\r\n\r\nall the afternoon they sat in the garden close to the stream that came\r\nout of the rock and an wolf told fathers tales of his only son  of the\r\ngreat cricket match with castra puerorum when he had made a hundred not\r\nout  of the school races when he had won so many prizes  of the\r\nswimming match in the islam river when after he had won the race and had\r\ndressed himself he went into the water in his clothes to help some\r\nchildren who had upset a boat  how when widow nortons only son could\r\nnot be found he dived into the deep hole of the intake of the milldam of\r\nthe great carstone mills where wingate the farrier had been drowned  and\r\nhow after diving twice without success he had insisted on going down\r\nthe third time though people had tried to hold him back and how he had\r\nbrought up in his arms the child all white and so near death that they\r\nhad to put him in the ashes of the bakers oven before he could be\r\nbrought back to life\r\n\r\nwhen her nurse came to take her to bed she slid down from her fathers\r\nknee and coming over to dr an wolf gravely held out her hand and said\r\ngoodbye  then she kissed him and said\r\n\r\nthank you so much mr harolds daddy  wont you come soon again and\r\ntell us more  then she jumped again upon her fathers knee and hugged\r\nhim round the neck and kissed him and whispered in his ear\r\n\r\ndaddy please make mr harolds daddy when he comes again bring harold\r\nwith him\r\n\r\nafter all it is natural for women to put the essence of the letter in the\r\npostscript\r\n\r\ntwo weeks afterwards dr an wolf came again and brought harold with him\r\nthe time had gone heavily with little stephen when she knew that harold\r\nwas coming with his father  stephen had been all afire to see the big\r\nboy whose feats had so much interested her and for a whole week had\r\nflooded mrs jarrold with questions which she was unable to answer  at\r\nlast the time came and she went out to the hall door with her father to\r\nwelcome the guests  at the top of the great granite steps down which in\r\ntime of bad weather the white awning ran she stood holding her fathers\r\nhand and waving a welcome\r\n\r\ngood morning harold  good morning mr harolds daddy\r\n\r\nthe meeting was a great pleasure to both the children and resulted in an\r\nimmediate friendship  the small girl at once conceived a great\r\nadmiration for the big strong boy nearly twice her age and more than\r\ntwice her size  at her time of life the convenances are not and love is\r\na thing to be spoken out at once and in the open  mrs jarrold from the\r\nmoment she set eyes on him liked the big kindlyfaced boy who treated\r\nher like a lady and who stood awkwardly blushing and silent in the\r\nmiddle of the nursery listening to the tiny childs proffers of\r\naffection  for whatever kind of love it is that boys are capable of\r\nharold had fallen into it  calflove is a thing habitually treated\r\nwith contempt  it may be ridiculous but all the same it is a serious\r\nrealityto the calf\r\n\r\nharolds newfound affection was as deep as his nature  an only child\r\nwho had in his memory nothing of a mothers love his naturally\r\naffectionate nature had in his childish days found no means of\r\nexpression  a man child can hardly pour out his full heart to a man\r\neven a father or a comrade and this child had not in a way the\r\nconsolations of other children  his fathers secondary occupation of\r\nteaching brought other boys to the house and necessitated a domestic\r\nroutine which had to be exact  there was no place for little girls in a\r\nboys school and though many of dr an wolfs friends who were mothers\r\nmade much of the pretty quiet boy and took him to play with their\r\nchildren he never seemed to get really intimate with them  the equality\r\nof companionship was wanting  boys he knew and with them he could hold\r\nhis own and yet be on affectionate terms  but girls were strange to him\r\nand in their presence he was shy  with this lack of understanding of the\r\nother sex grew up a sort of awe of it  his opportunities of this kind\r\nof study were so few that the view never could become rectified\r\n\r\nand so it was that from his boyhood up to his twelfth year harolds\r\nknowledge of girlhood never increased nor did his awe diminish  when his\r\nfather had told him all about his visit to normanstand and of the\r\ninvitation which had been extended to him there came first awe then\r\ndoubt then expectation  between harold and his father there was love\r\nand trust and sympathy   the fathers married love so soon cut short\r\nfound expression towards his child and between them there had never been\r\neven the shadow of a cloud  when his father told him how pretty the\r\nlittle stephen was how dainty how sweet he began to picture her in his\r\nminds eye and to be bashfully excited over meeting her\r\n\r\nhis first glimpse of stephen was he felt one that he never could\r\nforget  she had made up her mind that she would let harold see what she\r\ncould do  harold could fly kites and swim and play cricket she could\r\nnot do any of these but she could ride  harold should see her pony and\r\nsee her riding him all by herself  and there would be another pony for\r\nharold a big big big oneshe had spoken about its size herself to\r\ntopham the studgroom  she had coaxed her daddy into promising that\r\nafter lunch she should take harold riding  to this end she had made\r\nready early  she had insisted on putting on the red riding habit which\r\ndaddy had given her for her birthday and now she stood on the top of the\r\nsteps all glorious in hunting pink with the habit held over her arms\r\nwith the tiny huntinghoots all shiny underneath  she had no hat on and\r\nher beautiful hair of golden red shone in its glory  but even it was\r\nalmost outshone by the joyous flush on her cheeks as she stood waving the\r\nlittle hand that did not hold daddys  she was certainly a picture to\r\ndream of  her fathers eyes lost nothing of her dainty beauty  he was\r\nso proud of her that he almost forgot to wish that she had been a boy\r\nthe pleasure he felt in her appearance was increased by the fact that her\r\ndress was his own idea\r\n\r\nduring luncheon stephen was fairly silent she usually chattered all\r\nthrough as freely as a bird sings  stephen was silent because the\r\noccasion was important  besides daddy wasnt all alone and therefore\r\nhad not to be cheered up  alsothis in postscript formharold was\r\nsilent  in her present frame of mind harold could do no wrong and what\r\nharold did was right  she was unconsciously learning already a lesson\r\nfrom his presence\r\n\r\nthat evening when going to bed she came to say goodnight to daddy  after\r\nshe had kissed him she also kissed old mr harold as she now called\r\nhim and as a matter of course kissed harold also  he coloured up at\r\nonce  it was the first time a girl had ever kissed him\r\n\r\nthe next day from early morning until bedtime was one long joy to\r\nstephen and there were few things of interest that harold had not been\r\nshown there were few of the little secrets which had not been shared\r\nwith him as they went about hand in hand  like all manly boys harold was\r\ngood to little children and patient with them  he was content to follow\r\nstephen about and obey all her behests  he had fallen in love with her\r\nto the very bottom of his boyish heart\r\n\r\nwhen the guests were going stephen stood with her father on the steps to\r\nsee them off  when the carriage had swept behind the farthest point in\r\nthe long avenue and when harolds cap waving from the window could no\r\nlonger be seen squire norman turned to go in but paused in obedience to\r\nthe unconscious restraint of stephens hand  he waited patiently till\r\nwith a long sigh she turned to him and they went in together\r\n\r\nthat night before she went to bed stephen came and sat on her fathers\r\nknee and after sundry pattings and kissings whispered in his ear\r\n\r\ndaddy wouldnt it be nice if harold could come here altogether\r\ncouldnt you ask him to  and old mr harold could come too  oh i wish\r\nhe was here\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter ivharold at normanstand\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo years afterwards a great blow fell upon harold  his father who had\r\nbeen suffering from repeated attacks of influenza was when in the low\r\ncondition following this seized with pneumonia to which in a few days\r\nhe succumbed  harold was heartbroken  the affection which had been\r\nbetween him and his father had been so consistent that he had never known\r\na time when it was not\r\n\r\nwhen squire norman had returned to the house with him after the funeral\r\nhe sat in silence holding the boys hand till he had wept his heart out\r\nby this time the two were old friends and the boy was not afraid or too\r\nshy to break down before him  there was sufficient of the love of the\r\nold generation to begin with trust in the new\r\n\r\npresently when the storm was past and harold had become his own man\r\nagain norman said\r\n\r\nand now harold i want you to listen to me  you know my dear boy\r\nthat i am your fathers oldest friend and right sure i am that he would\r\napprove of what i say  you must come home with me to live  i know that\r\nin his last hours the great concern of your dear fathers heart would\r\nhave been for the future of his boy  and i know too that it was a\r\ncomfort to him to feel that you and i are such friends and that the son\r\nof my dearest old friend would be as a son to me  we have been friends\r\nyou and i a long time harold and we have learned to trust and i hope\r\nto love one another  and you and my little stephen are such friends\r\nalready that your coming into the house will be a joy to us all  why\r\nlong ago when first you came she said to me the night you went away\r\ndaddy wouldnt it be nice if harold could come here altogether\r\n\r\nand so harold an wolf came back with the squire to normanstand and from\r\nthat day on became a member of his house and as a son to him  stephens\r\ndelight at his coming was of course largely qualified by her sympathy\r\nwith his grief but it would have been hard to give him more comfort than\r\nshe did in her own pretty way  putting her lips to his she kissed him\r\nand holding his big hand in both of her little ones she whispered\r\nsoftly\r\n\r\npoor harold  you and i should love each other for we have both lost\r\nour mother  and now you have lost your father  but you must let my dear\r\ndaddy be yours too\r\n\r\nat this time harold was between fourteen and fifteen years old  he was\r\nwell educated in so far as private teaching went  his father had devoted\r\nmuch care to him so that he was well grounded in all the academic\r\nbranches of learning  he was also for his years an expert in most\r\nmanly exercises  he could ride anything shoot straight fence run\r\njump or swim with any boy more than his age and size\r\n\r\nin normanstand his education was continued by the rector  the squire\r\nused often to take him with him when he went to ride or fish or shoot\r\nfrankly telling him that as his daughter was as yet too young to be his\r\ncompanion in these matters he would act as her locum tenens  his living\r\nin the house and his helping as he did in stephens studies made\r\nfamiliarity perpetual  he was just enough her senior to command her\r\nchildish obedience and there were certain qualities in his nature which\r\nwere eminently calculated to win and keep the respect of women as well as\r\nof men  he was the very incarnation of sincerity and had now and again\r\nin certain ways a sublime selfnegation which at times seemed in\r\nstartling contrast to a manifestly militant nature  when at school he\r\nhad often been involved in fights which were nearly always on matters of\r\nprinciple and by a sort of unconscious chivalry he was generally found\r\nfighting on the weaker side  harolds father had been very proud of his\r\nancestry which was gothic through the dutch as the manifestly corrupted\r\nprefix of the original name implied and he had gathered from a constant\r\nstudy of the sagas something of the philosophy which lay behind the ideas\r\nof the vikings\r\n\r\nthis new stage of harolds life made for quicker development than any\r\nwhich had gone before  hitherto he had not the same sense of\r\nresponsibility  to obey is in itself a relief and as it is an actual\r\nconsolation to weak natures so it is only a retarding of the strong  now\r\nhe had another individuality to think of  there was in his own nature a\r\nvein of anxiety of which the subconsciousness of his own strength threw\r\nup the outcrop\r\n\r\nlittle stephen with the instinct of her sex discovered before long this\r\nweakness  for it is a weakness when any quality can be assailed or used\r\nthe using of a mans weakness is not always coquetry but it is something\r\nvery like it  many a time the little girl who looked up to and admired\r\nthe big boy who could compel her to anything when he was so minded\r\nwould for her own ends work on his sense of responsibility taking an\r\nelfin delight in his discomfiture\r\n\r\nthe result of stephens harmless little coquetries was that harold had\r\noccasionally either to thwart some little plan of daring or else cover\r\nup its results  in either case her confidence in him grew so that\r\nbefore long he became an established fact in her life a being in whose\r\npower and discretion and loyalty she had absolute blind faith  and this\r\nfeeling seemed to grow with her own growth  indeed at one time it came\r\nto be more than an ordinary faith  it happened thus\r\n\r\nthe old church of st stephen which was the parish church of\r\nnormanstand had a peculiar interest for the norman family  there\r\neither within the existing walls or those which had preceded them when\r\nthe church was rebuilt by that sir stephen who was standardbearer to\r\nhenry vi were buried all the direct members of the line  it was an\r\nunbroken record of the inheritors since the first sir stephen who had\r\nhis place in the domesday book  without in the churchyard close to the\r\nchurch were buried all such of the collaterals as had died within hail\r\nof norcester  some there were of course who having achieved distinction\r\nin various walks of life were further honoured by a restingplace within\r\nthe chancel  the whole interior was full of records of the family\r\nsquire norman was fond of coming to the place and often from the very\r\nbeginning had taken stephen with him  one of her earliest recollections\r\nwas kneeling down with her father who held her hand in his whilst with\r\nthe other he wiped the tears from his eyes before a tomb sculptured\r\nbeautifully in snowy marble  she never forgot the words he had said to\r\nher\r\n\r\nyou will always remember darling that your dear mother rests in this\r\nsacred place  when i am gone if you are ever in any trouble come here\r\ncome alone and open out your heart  you need never fear to ask god for\r\nhelp at the grave of your mother  the child had been impressed as had\r\nbeen many and many another of her race  for seven hundred years each\r\nchild of the house of norman had been brought alone by either parent and\r\nhad heard some such words  the custom had come to be almost a family\r\nritual and it never failed to leave its impress in greater or lesser\r\ndegree\r\n\r\nwhenever harold had in the early days paid a visit to normanstand the\r\nchurch had generally been an objective of their excursions  he was\r\nalways delighted to go  his love for his own ancestry made him admire\r\nand respect that of others so that stephens enthusiasm in the matter\r\nwas but another cord to bind him to her\r\n\r\nin one of their excursions they found the door into the crypt open and\r\nnothing would do stephen but that they should enter it  today however\r\nthey had no light but they arranged that on the morrow they would bring\r\ncandles with them and explore the place thoroughly  the afternoon of the\r\nnext day saw them at the door of the crypt with a candle which harold\r\nproceeded to light  stephen looked on admiringly and said in a half\r\nconscious way the halfconsciousness being shown in the implication\r\n\r\nyou are not afraid of the crypt\r\n\r\nnot a bit  in my fathers church there was a crypt and i was in it\r\nseveral times  as he spoke the memory of the last time he had been\r\nthere swept over him  he seemed to see again the many lights held in\r\nhands that were never still making a grim gloom where the black shadows\r\nwere not to hear again the stamp and hurried shuffle of the many feet\r\nas the great oak coffin was borne by the struggling mass of men down the\r\nsteep stairway and in through the narrow door    and then the hush\r\nwhen voices faded away and the silence seemed a real thing as for a\r\nwhile he stood alone close to the dead father who had been all in all to\r\nhim  and once again he seemed to feel the recall to the living world of\r\nsorrow and of light when his inert hand was taken in the strong loving\r\none of squire norman\r\n\r\nhe paused and drew back\r\n\r\nwhy dont you go on she asked surprised\r\n\r\nhe did not like to tell her then  somehow it seemed out of place  he\r\nhad often spoken to her of his father and she had always been a\r\nsympathetic listener but here at the entrance of the grim vault he did\r\nnot wish to pain her with his own thoughts of sorrow and all the terrible\r\nmemories which the similarity of the place evoked  and even whilst he\r\nhesitated there came to him a thought so laden with pain and fear that he\r\nrejoiced at the pause which gave it to him in time  it was in that very\r\ncrypt that stephens mother had been buried and had they two gone in as\r\nthey had intended the girl might have seen her mothers coffin as he had\r\nseen his fathers but under circumstances which made him shiver  he had\r\nbeen as he said often in the crypt at carstone and well he knew the\r\nsordidness of the chamber of death  his imagination was alive as well as\r\nhis memory he shuddered not for himself but for stephen  how could he\r\nallow the girl to suffer in such a way as she might as she infallibly\r\nwould if it were made apparent to her in such a brutal way  how\r\npitiful how meanly pitiful is the aftermath of death  well he\r\nremembered how many a night he woke in an agony thinking of how his\r\nfather lay in that cold silent duststrewn vault in the silence and\r\nthe dark with never a ray of light or hope or love  gone abandoned\r\nforgotten by all save perhaps one heart which bled    he would save\r\nlittle stephen if he could from such a memory  he would not give any\r\nreason for refusing to go in\r\n\r\nhe blew out the candle and turned the key in the lock took it out and\r\nput it in his pocket\r\n\r\ncome stephen he said let us go somewhere else  we will not go into\r\nthe crypt today\r\n\r\nwhy not  the lips that spoke were pouted mutinously and the face was\r\nflushed  the imperious little lady was not at all satisfied to give up\r\nthe cherished project  for a whole day and night she had whilst waking\r\nthought of the coming adventure the thrill of it was not now to be\r\nturned to cold disappointment without even an explanation  she did not\r\nthink that harold was afraid that would be ridiculous  but she\r\nwondered and mysteries always annoyed her  she did not like to be at\r\nfault more especially when other people knew  all the pride in her\r\nrevolted\r\n\r\nwhy not she repeated more imperiously still\r\n\r\nharold said kindly\r\n\r\nbecause stephen there is really a good reason  dont ask me for i\r\ncant tell you  you must take it from me that i am right  you know\r\ndear that i wouldnt willingly disappoint you and i know that you had\r\nset your heart on this  but indeed indeed i have a good reason\r\n\r\nstephen was really angry now  she was amenable to reason though she did\r\nnot consciously know what reason was but to accept some one elses\r\nreason blindfold was repugnant to her nature even at her then age  she\r\nwas about to speak angrily but looking up she saw that harolds mouth\r\nwas set with marble firmness  so after her manner she acquiesced in\r\nthe inevitable and said\r\n\r\nall right  harold\r\n\r\nbut in the inner recesses of her firmset mind was a distinct intention\r\nto visit the vault when more favourable circumstances would permit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter vthe crypt\r\n\r\n\r\nit was some weeks before stephen got the chance she wanted  she knew it\r\nwould be difficult to evade harolds observation for the big boys\r\nacuteness as to facts had impressed itself on her  it was strange that\r\nout of her very trust in harold came a form of distrust in others  in\r\nthe little matter of evading him she inclined to any one in whom there\r\nwas his opposite in whose reliability she instinctively mistrusted\r\nthere is nothing bad or good but thinking makes it so  to enter that\r\ncrypt which had seemed so small a matter at first had now in process of\r\nthinking and wishing and scheming become a thing to be much desired\r\nharold saw or rather felt that something was in the girls mind and\r\ntook for granted that it had something to do with the crypt  but he\r\nthought it better not to say anything lest he should keep awake a desire\r\nwhich he hoped would die naturally\r\n\r\none day it was arranged that harold should go over to carstone to see the\r\nsolicitor who had wound up his fathers business  he was to stay the\r\nnight and ride back next day  stephen on hearing of the arrangement so\r\ncontrived matters that master everard the son of a banker who had\r\nrecently purchased an estate in the neighbourhood was asked to come to\r\nplay with her on the day when harold left  it was holiday time at eton\r\nand he was at home  stephen did not mention to harold the fact of his\r\ncoming it was only from a chance allusion of mrs jarrold before he went\r\nthat he inferred it  he did not think the matter of sufficient\r\nimportance to wonder why stephen who generally told him everything had\r\nnot mentioned this\r\n\r\nduring their play stephen after pledging him to secrecy told leonard\r\nof her intention of visiting the crypt and asked him to help her in it\r\nthis was an adventure and as such commended itself to the schoolboy\r\nheart  he entered at once into the scheme con amore and the two\r\ndiscussed ways and means  leonards only regret was that he was\r\nassociated with a little girl in such a project  it was something of a\r\nblow to his personal vanity which was a large item in his moral\r\nequipment that such a project should have been initiated by the girl and\r\nnot by himself  he was to get possession of the key and in the forenoon\r\nof the next day he was to be waiting in the churchyard when stephen\r\nwould join him as soon as she could evade her nurse  she was now more\r\nthan eleven and had less need of being watched than in her earlier\r\nyears  it was possible with strategy to get away undiscovered for an\r\nhour\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nat carstone harold got though what he had to do that same afternoon and\r\narranged to start early in the morning for normanstand  after an early\r\nbreakfast he set out on his thirtymile journey at eight oclock\r\nlittlejohn his horse was in excellent form notwithstanding his long\r\njourney of the day before and with his nose pointed for home put his\r\nbest foot foremost  harold felt in great spirits  the long ride the day\r\nbefore had braced him physically though there were on his journey times\r\nof great sadness when the thought of his father came back to him and the\r\nsense of loss was renewed with each thought of his old home  but youth\r\nis naturally buoyant  his visit to the church the first thing on his\r\narrival at carstone and his kneeling before the stone made sacred to his\r\nfathers memory though it entailed a silent gush of tears did him good\r\nand even seemed to place his sorrow farther away  when he came again in\r\nthe morning before leaving carstone there were no tears  there was only\r\na holy memory which seemed to sanctify loss and his father seemed nearer\r\nto him than ever\r\n\r\nas he drew near normanstand he looked forward eagerly to seeing stephen\r\nand the sight of the old church lying far below him as he came down the\r\nsteep road over alt hill which was the shortcut from norcester set his\r\nmind working  his visit to the tomb of his own father made him think of\r\nthe day when he kept stephen from entering the crypt\r\n\r\nthe keenest thought is not always conscious  it was without definite\r\nintention that when he came to the bridlepath harold turned his horses\r\nhead and rode down to the churchyard  as he pushed open the door of the\r\nchurch he half expected to see stephen and there was a vague possibility\r\nthat leonard everard might be with her\r\n\r\nthe church was cool and dim  coming from the hot glare the august\r\nsunshine it seemed at the first glance dark  he looked around and a\r\nsense of relief came over him  the place was empty\r\n\r\nbut even as he stood there came a sound which made his heart grow cold\r\na cry muffled far away and full of anguish a sobbing cry which\r\nsuddenly ceased\r\n\r\nit was the voice of stephen  he instinctively knew where it came from\r\nthe crypt  only for the experience he had had of her desire to enter the\r\nplace he would never have suspected that it was so close to him  he ran\r\ntowards the corner where commenced the steps leading downward  as he\r\nreached the spot a figure came rushing up the steps  a boy in eton\r\njacket and wide collar careless pale and agitated  it was leonard\r\neverard  harold seized him as he came\r\n\r\nwhere is stephen he cried in a quick low voice\r\n\r\nin the vault below there  she dropped her light and then took mine and\r\nshe dropped it too  let me go  let me go  he struggled to get away\r\nbut harold held him tight\r\n\r\nwhere are the matches\r\n\r\nin my pocket  let me go  let me go\r\n\r\ngive me themthis instant  he was examining the frightened boys\r\nwaistcoat pockets as he spoke  when he had got the matches he let the\r\nboy go and ran down the steps and through the open door into the crypt\r\ncalling out as he came\r\n\r\nstephen  stephen dear where are you  it is iharold  there was no\r\nresponse his heart seemed to grow cold and his knees to weaken  the\r\nmatch spluttered and flashed and in the momentary glare he saw across\r\nthe vault which was not a large place a white mass on the ground  he\r\nhad to go carefully lest the match should be blown out by the wind of\r\nhis passage but on coming close he saw that it was stephen lying\r\nsenseless in front of a great coffin which rested on a builtout pile of\r\nmasonry  then the match went out  in the flare of the next one he lit\r\nhe saw a piece of candle lying on top of the coffin  he seized and lit\r\nit  he was able to think coolly despite his agitation and knew that\r\nlight was the first necessity  the bruised wick was slow to catch he\r\nhad to light another match his last one before it flamed  the couple\r\nof seconds that the light went down till the grease melted and the flame\r\nleaped again seemed of considerable length  when the lit candle was\r\nplaced steadily on top of the coffin and a light dim though strong\r\nenough to see with spread around he stooped and lifted stephen in his\r\narms  she was quite senseless and so limp that a great fear came upon\r\nhim that she might be dead  he did not waste time but carried her\r\nacross the vault where the door to the church steps stood out sharp\r\nagainst the darkness and bore her up into the church  holding her in\r\none arm with the other hand he dragged some long cushions from one of\r\nthe pews and spread them on the floor on these he laid her  his heart\r\nwas smitten with love and pity as he looked  she was so helpless so\r\npitifully helpless  her arms and legs were doubled up as though broken\r\ndisjointed the white frock was smeared with patches of thick dust\r\ninstinctively he stooped and pulled the frock down and straightened out\r\nthe arms and feet  he knelt beside her and felt if her heart was still\r\nbeating a great fear over him a sick apprehension  a gush of thankful\r\nprayer came from his heart  thank god she was alive he could feel her\r\nheart beat though faintly underneath his hand  he started to his feet\r\nand ran towards the door seizing his hat which lay on a seat  he\r\nwanted it to bring back some water  as he passed out of the door he saw\r\nleonard a little distance off but took no notice of him  he ran to the\r\nstream filled his hat with water and brought it back  when he came\r\ninto the church he saw stephen already partially restored sitting up on\r\nthe cushions with leonard supporting her\r\n\r\nhe was rejoiced but somehow disappointed  he would rather leonard had\r\nnot been there  he rememberedhe could not forgetthe white face of\r\nthe boy who fled out of the crypt leaving stephen in a faint within and\r\nwho had lingered outside the church door whilst he ran for water  harold\r\ncame forward quickly and raised stephen intending to bring her into the\r\nfresh air  he had a shrewd idea that the sight of the sky and gods\r\ngreenery would be the best medicine for her after her fright  he lifted\r\nher in his strong arms as he used to do when she was a very little child\r\nand had got tired in their walks together and carried her to the door\r\nshe lent herself unconsciously to the movement holding fast with her arm\r\nround his neck as she used to do  in her clinging was the expression of\r\nher trust in him  the little sigh with which she laid her head on his\r\nshoulder was the tribute to his masculine power and her belief in it\r\nevery instant her senses were coming back to her more and more  the veil\r\nof oblivion was passing from her halfclosed eyes as the tide of full\r\nremembrance swept in upon her  her inner nature was expressed in the\r\nsequence of her emotions  her first feeling was one of her own fault\r\nthe sight of harold and his proximity recalled to her vividly how he had\r\nrefused to go into the crypt and how she had intentionally deceived him\r\nnegatively as to her intention of doing that of which he disapproved\r\nher second feeling was one of justice and was perhaps partially evoked\r\nby the sight of leonard who followed close as harold brought her to the\r\ndoor  she did not wish to speak of herself or harold before him but she\r\ndid not hesitate to speak of him to harold\r\n\r\nyou must not blame leonard  it was all my fault  i made him come  her\r\ngenerosity appealed to harold  he was angry with the boy for being there\r\nat all but more for his desertion of the girl in her trouble\r\n\r\nim not blaming him for being with you he said simply  leonard spoke\r\nat once  he had been waiting to defend himself for that was what first\r\nconcerned that young gentleman next to his pleasure his safety most\r\nappealed to him\r\n\r\ni went to get help  you had let the candle drop and how could i see in\r\nthe dark  you would insist on looking at the plate on the coffin\r\n\r\na low moan broke from stephen a long low trembling moan which went to\r\nharolds heart  her head drooped over again on his shoulder and she\r\nclung close to him as the memory of her shock came back to her  harold\r\nspoke to leonard over his shoulder in a low fierce whisper which\r\nstephen did not seem to hear\r\n\r\nthere that will do  go away  you have done enough already  go  go\r\nhe added more sternly as the boy seemed disposed to argue  leonard ran\r\na few steps then walked to the lichgate where he waited\r\n\r\nstephen clung close to harold in a state of agitation which was almost\r\nhysterical  she buried her face in his shoulder sobbing brokenly\r\n\r\noh harold  it was too awful  i never thought never for a moment\r\nthat my poor dear mother was buried in the crypt  and when i went to\r\nlook at the name on the coffin that was nearest to where i was i knocked\r\naway the dust and then i saw her name margaret norman aetat   i\r\ncouldnt bear it  she was only a girl herself only just twice my\r\nagelying there in that terrible dark place with all the thick dust and\r\nthe spiders webs  oh harold harold  how shall i ever bear to think\r\nof her lying there and that i shall never see her dear face  never\r\nnever\r\n\r\nhe tried to soothe her by patting and holding her hands  for a good\r\nwhile the resolution of the girl faltered and she was but as a little\r\nchild  then her habitual strength of mind asserted itself  she did not\r\nask harold how she came to be out in the church instead of in the crypt\r\nwhen she recovered her senses  she seemed to take it for granted that\r\nleonard had carried her out and when she said how brave it had been of\r\nhim harold with his customary generosity allowed her to preserve the\r\nbelief  when they had made their way to the gate leonard came up to\r\nthem but before he could speak stephen had begun to thank him  he\r\nallowed her to do so though the sight of harolds mouth set in scorn\r\nand his commanding eyes firmly fixed on him made him grow hot and cold\r\nalternately  he withdrew without speaking and took his way home with a\r\nheart full of bitterness and revengeful feelings\r\n\r\nin the park stephen tried to dust herself and then harold tried to\r\nassist her  but her white dress was incurably soiled the fine dust of\r\nthe vault seemed to have got ingrained in the muslin  when she got to\r\nthe house she stole upstairs so that no one might notice her till she\r\nhad made herself tidy\r\n\r\nthe next day but one she took harold for a walk in the afternoon  when\r\nthey were quite alone and out of earshot she said\r\n\r\ni have been thinking all night about poor mother  of course i know she\r\ncannot be moved from the crypt  she must remain there  but there\r\nneednt be all that dust  i want you to come there with me some time\r\nsoon  i fear i am afraid to go alone  i want to bring some flowers and\r\nto tidy up the place  wont you come with me this time  i know now\r\nharold why you didnt let me go in before  but now it is different\r\nthis is not curiosity  it is duty and love  wont you come with me\r\nharold\r\n\r\nharold leaped from the edge of the haha where he had been sitting and\r\nheld up his hand  she took it and leaped down lightly beside him\r\n\r\ncome he said let us go there now  she took his arm when they got\r\non the path again and clinging to him in her pretty girlish way they\r\nwent together to the piece of garden which she called her own there they\r\npicked a great bunch of beautiful white flowers  then they walked to the\r\nold church  the door was open and they passed in  harold took from his\r\npocket a tiny key  this surprised her and heightened the agitation\r\nwhich she naturally suffered from revisiting the place  she said nothing\r\nwhilst he opened the door to the crypt  within on a bracket stood some\r\ncandles in glass shades and boxes of matches  harold lit three candles\r\nand leaving one of them on the shelf and placing his cap beside it took\r\nthe other two in his hands  stephen holding her flowers tightly to her\r\nbreast with her right hand took harolds arm with the left and with\r\nbeating heart entered the crypt\r\n\r\nfor several minutes harold kept her engaged telling her about the crypt\r\nin his fathers church and how he went down at his last visit to see the\r\ncoffin of his dear father and how he knelt before it  stephen was much\r\nmoved and held tight to his arm her heart beating  but in the time she\r\nwas getting accustomed to the place  her eyes useless at first on\r\ncoming out of the bright sunlight and not able to distinguish anything\r\nbegan to take in the shape of the place and to see the rows of great\r\ncoffins that stood out along the far wall  she also saw with surprise\r\nthat the newest coffin on which for several reasons her eyes rested was\r\nno longer dusty but was scrupulously clean  following with her eyes as\r\nwell as she could see into the further corners she saw that there the\r\nsame reform had been effected  even the walls and ceiling had been swept\r\nof the hanging cobwebs and the floor was clean with the cleanliness of\r\nablution  still holding harolds arm she moved over towards her\r\nmothers coffin and knelt before it  harold knelt with her for a little\r\nwhile she remained still and silent praying inwardly  then she rose\r\nand taking her great bunch of flowers placed them lovingly on the lid of\r\nthe coffin above where she thought her mothers heart would be  then she\r\nturned to harold her eyes flowing and her cheeks wet with tears and\r\nlaid her head against his breast  her arms could not go round his neck\r\ntill he had bent his head for with his great height he simply towered\r\nabove her  presently she was quiet the paroxysm of her grief had\r\npassed  she took harolds hand in both hers and together they went to\r\nthe door  with his disengaged hand for he would not have disturbed the\r\nother for worlds harold put out the lights and locked the door behind\r\nthem\r\n\r\nin the church she held him away from her and looked him fairly in the\r\nface  she said slowly\r\n\r\nharold was it you who had the crypt cleaned  he answered in a low\r\nvoice\r\n\r\ni knew you would want to go again\r\n\r\nshe took the great hand which she held between hers and before he knew\r\nwhat she was doing and could prevent her raised it to her lips and\r\nkissed it saying lovingly\r\n\r\noh harold  no brother in all the wide world could be kinder  andand\r\nthis with a sob we both thank you mother and i\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter via visit to oxford\r\n\r\n\r\nthe next important move in the household was harolds going to cambridge\r\nhis father had always intended this and squire norman had borne his\r\nwishes in mind  harold joined trinity the college which had been his\r\nfathers and took up his residence in due course\r\n\r\nstephen was now nearly twelve  her range of friendships naturally\r\nlimited by her circumstances in life was enlarged to the full and if\r\nshe had not many close friends there were at least of them all that was\r\nnumerically possible  she still kept up to certain degree the little\r\ngatherings which in her childhood were got together for her amusement\r\nand in the various games then instituted she still took a part  she\r\nnever lost sight of the fact that her father took a certain pleasure in\r\nher bodily vigour  and though with her growing years and the conscious\r\nacceptance of her womanhood she lost sight of the old childish fancy of\r\nbeing a boy instead of a girl she could not lose sight of the fact that\r\nstrength and alertness are sources of feminine as well as of masculine\r\npower\r\n\r\namongst the young friends who came from time to time during his holidays\r\nwas leonard everard now a tall handsome boy  he was one of those boys\r\nwho develop young and who seem never to have any of that gawky stage so\r\nnoticeable in the youth of men made in a large pattern  he was always\r\nwellpoised trimset alert fleet of foot and springy all over  in\r\ngames he was facile princeps seeming to make his effort always in the\r\nright way and without exertion as if by an instinct of physical\r\nmasterdom  his universal success in such matters helped to give him an\r\neasy debonair manner which was in itself winning  so physically complete\r\na youth has always a charm  in its very presence there is a sort of\r\nsympathetic expression such as comes with the sunshine\r\n\r\nstephen always in leonards presence showed something of the common\r\nattitude  his youth and beauty and sex all had their influence on her\r\nthe influence of sex as it is understood with regard to a later period\r\nof life did not in her case exist cupids darts are barbed and winged\r\nfor more adult victims  but in her case leonards masculine superiority\r\nemphasised by the few years between their age his sublime selfbelief\r\nand above all his absolute disregard for herself or her wishes or her\r\nfeelings put him on a level at which she had to look up to him  the\r\nfirst step in the ladder of preeminence had been achieved when she\r\nrealised that he was not on her level the second when she experienced\r\nrather than thought that he had more influence on her than she had on\r\nhim  here again was a little morsel of hero worship which though based\r\non a misconception of fact was still of influence  in that episode of\r\nthe crypt she had always believed that it was leonard who had carried her\r\nout and laid her on the church floor in light and safety  he had been\r\nstrong enough and resolute enough to do this whilst she had fainted\r\nharolds generous forbearance had really worked to a false end\r\n\r\nit was not strange therefore that she found occasional companionship\r\nwith the handsome wilful domineering boy somewhat of luxury  she did\r\nnot see him often enough to get tired of him to find out the weakness of\r\nhis character to realise his deepseated remorseless selfishness  but\r\nafter all he was only an episode in a young life which was full of\r\ninterests  term after term came and went the holidays had their\r\nseasonable pleasures occasionally shared in common  that was all\r\n\r\nharolds attitude was the same as ever  he was of a constant nature and\r\nnow that manhood was within hail the love of his boyhood was ripening to\r\na mans love  that was all  he was with regard to stephen the same\r\ndevoted worshipping protector without thought of self without hope of\r\nreward  whatever stephen wished harold did and stephen knowing their\r\nold wishes and their old pleasures was content with their renewal  each\r\nholiday between the terms became mainly a repetition of the days of the\r\nold life  they lived in the past\r\n\r\namongst the things that did not change was stephens riding dress  the\r\nscarlet habit had never been a thing for everyday wear but had from the\r\nfirst been kept for special occasions  stephen herself knew that it was\r\nnot a conventional costume but she rather preferred it if on that\r\naccount alone  in a certain way she felt justified in using it for a\r\nred habit was a sort of tradition in the family\r\n\r\nit was on one of these occasions that she had gone with harold into the\r\nchurchyard where they had heard the discussion regarding god and the\r\nangels\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nwhen stephen was about sixteen she went for a short visit to oxford  she\r\nstayed at somerville with mrs egerton an old friend of her mothers\r\nwho was a professor at the college  she sent back her maid who had\r\ntravelled with her as she knew that the college girls did not have\r\nservants of their own  the visit was prolonged by mutual consent into a\r\nduration of some weeks  stephen fell in love with the place and the\r\nlife and had serious thoughts of joining the college herself  indeed\r\nshe had made up her mind to ask her father to allow her knowing well\r\nthat he would consent to that or to any other wholesome wish of hers  but\r\nthen came the thought that he would be all alone at home and following\r\nthat came another thought and one of more poignant feeling  he was\r\nalone now  already for many days she had left him for the first time\r\nin her life  stephen was quick to act well she knew that at home there\r\nwould be no fault found with her for a speedy return  within a few hours\r\nshe had brought her visit to an end and was by herself despite mrs\r\negertons protest in the train on the way back to norcester\r\n\r\nin the train she began to review for the first time her visit to the\r\nuniversity  all had been so strange and new and delightful to her that\r\nshe had never stopped for retrospect  life in the new and enchanting\r\nplace had been in the moving present  the mind had been receptive only\r\ngathering data for later thought  during her visit she had had no one to\r\ndirect her thought and so it had been all personal with the freedom of\r\nindividuality at large  of course her mothers friend skilled in the\r\nmindworkings of average girls and able to pick her way through\r\nintellectual and moral quagmires had taken good care to point out to her\r\ncertain intellectual movements and certain moral lessons just as she had\r\nin their various walks and drives pointed out matters of\r\ninterestarchitectural beauties and spots of historic import  and she\r\nhad taken in loyally accepted and thoroughly assimilated all that she\r\nhad been told  but there were other lessons which were for her young\r\neyes facts which the older eyes had ceased to notice if they had ever\r\nnoticed them at all  the selfcontent the sexcontent in the endless\r\ntide of young men that thronged the streets and quads and parks the all\r\nsufficing nature of sport or study to whichever their inclinations\r\ntended  the small part which womankind seemed to have in their lives\r\nstephen had had as we know a peculiar training whatever her instincts\r\nwere her habits were largely boy habits  here she was amongst boys a\r\nglorious tide of them it made now and again her heart beat to look at\r\nthem  and yet amongst them all she was only an outsider  she could not\r\ndo anything better than any of them  of course each time she went out\r\nshe became conscious of admiring glances she could not be woman without\r\nsuch consciousness  but it was as a girl that men looked at her not as\r\nan equal  as well as personal experience and the lessons of eyes and\r\nears and intelligence there were other things to classify and adjust\r\nthings which were entirely from the outside of her own life  the\r\nfragments of commonroom gossip which it had been her fortune to hear\r\naccidentally now and again  the half confidences of scandals borne on\r\nwhispered breaths  the whole confidences of dormitory and study which\r\nshe had been privileged to share  all were parts of the new and strange\r\nworld the great world which had swum into her ken\r\n\r\nas she sat now in the train with some formulation of memory already\r\naccomplished in the two hours of solitude her first comment spoken half\r\naudibly would have surprised her teachers as much as it would have\r\nsurprised herself if she had been conscious of it for as yet her\r\nthinking was not selfconscious\r\n\r\nsurely i am not like that\r\n\r\nit was of the women she had been thinking not of the men  the glimpse\r\nwhich she had had of her own sex had been an awakening to her and the\r\nawakening had not been to a pleasant world  all at once she seemed to\r\nrealise that her sex had defectslittlenesses meannesses cowardices\r\nfalsenesses  that their occupations were apt to be trivial or narrow or\r\nselfish that their desires were earthly and their tastes coarse that\r\nwhat she held to be goodness was apt to be realised only as fear  that\r\ninnocence was but ignorance or at least baffled curiosity  that   \r\n\r\na flood of shame swept over her and instinctively she put her hands\r\nbefore her burning face  as usual she was running all at once into\r\nextremes\r\n\r\nand above all these was borne upon her and for the first time in her\r\nlife that she was herself a woman\r\n\r\nfor a long time she sat quite still  the train thrilled and roared on\r\nits way  crowded stations took and gave their quantum of living freight\r\nbut the young girl sat abstracted unmoved seemingly unconscious  all\r\nthe dominance and energy of her nature were at work\r\n\r\nif indeed she was a woman and had to abide by the exigencies of her\r\nown sex she would at least not be ruled and limited by womans weakness\r\nshe would plan and act and manage things for herself in her own way\r\n\r\nwhatever her thoughts might be she could at least control her acts  and\r\nthose acts should be based not on womans weakness but on mans\r\nstrength\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter viithe need of knowing\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen stephen announced her intention of going with her father to the\r\npetty sessions court there was consternation amongst the female\r\npopulation of normanstand and norwood  such a thing had not been heard\r\nof in the experiences of any of them  courts of justice were places for\r\nmen and the lower courts dealt with a class of cases    it was quite\r\nimpossible to imagine where any young lady could get such an idea   \r\n\r\nmiss laetitia rowly recognised that she had a difficult task before her\r\nfor she was by now accustomed to stephens quiet method of having her own\r\nway\r\n\r\nshe made a careful toilet before driving over to normanstand  her\r\nwearing her best bonnet was a circumstance not unattended with dread for\r\nsome one  behold her then sailing into the great drawingroom at\r\nnormanstand with her mind so firmly fixed on the task before her as to be\r\noblivious of minor considerations  she was so fond of stephen and\r\nadmired so truly her many beauties and fine qualities that she was\r\nsecure and without flaw in her purpose  stephen was in danger and\r\nthough she doubted if she would be able to effect any change she was\r\ndetermined that at least she should not go into danger with her eyes\r\nunopened\r\n\r\nstephen entered hastily and ran to her  she loved her greataunt really\r\nand truly loved her  and indeed it would have been strange if she had\r\nnot for from the earliest hour which she could recollect she had\r\nreceived from her nothing but the truest fondest affection  moreover\r\nshe deeply respected the old lady her truth her resolution her\r\nkindliness her genuine commonsense ability  stephen always felt safe\r\nwith her aunt  in the presence of others she might now and again have a\r\nqualm or a doubt but not with her  there was an abiding calm in her\r\nlove answering love realised and respected  her long and intimate\r\nknowledge of laetitia made her aware of her moods  she could read the\r\nsigns of them  she knew well the meaning of the bonnet which actually\r\nseemed to quiver as though it had a sentience of its own  she knew well\r\nthe cause of her aunts perturbation the pain which must be caused to\r\nher was perhaps the point of most resistance in herselfshe having made\r\nup her mind to her new experience  all she could do would be to try to\r\nreconcile her by the assurance of good intention by reason and by\r\nsweetness of manner  when she had kissed her and sat beside her holding\r\nher hand after her pretty way she seeing the elder woman somewhat at a\r\nloss opened the subject herself\r\n\r\nyou look troubled auntie  i hope it is nothing serious\r\n\r\nit is my dear  very serious  everything is serious to me which\r\ntouches you\r\n\r\nme auntie  hypocrisy is a fine art\r\n\r\nyes yes stephen  oh my dear child what is this i hear about your\r\ngoing to petty sessions with your father\r\n\r\noh that  why auntie dear you must not let that trouble you  it is\r\nall right  that is necessary\r\n\r\nnecessary the old ladys figure grew rigid and her voice was loud and\r\nhigh  necessary for a young lady to go to a court house  to hear low\r\npeople speaking of low crimes  to listen to cases of the most shocking\r\nkind cases of low immorality cases of a kind of a nature of aaclass\r\nthat you are not supposed to know anything about  really stephen   \r\n  she was drawing away her hand in indignation  but stephen held it\r\ntight as she said very sweetly\r\n\r\nthat is just it auntie  i am so ignorant that i feel i should know\r\nmore of the lives of those very people  miss laetitia interrupted\r\n\r\nignorant  of course you are ignorant  that is what you ought to be\r\nisnt it what we have all been devoting ourselves to effect ever since\r\nyou were born  read your third chapter of genesis and remember what came\r\nof eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge\r\n\r\ni think the tree of knowledge must have been an orange tree  the old\r\nlady looked up her interest aroused\r\n\r\nwhy\r\n\r\nbecause ever since eden other brides have worn its blossom  her tone\r\nwas demure  miss rowly looked sharply at her but her sharpness softened\r\noff into a smile\r\n\r\nhm she said and was silent  stephen seized the opportunity to put\r\nher own case\r\n\r\nauntie dear you must forgive me  you really must for my heart is set\r\non this  i assure you i am not doing it merely to please myself  i have\r\nthought over the whole matter  father has always wished me to be in a\r\npositiona position of knowledge and experienceto manage normanstand\r\nif i should ever succeed him  from the earliest time i can remember he\r\nhas always kept this before me and though of course i did not at first\r\nunderstand what it meant i have seemed in the last few years to know\r\nbetter  accordingly i learned all sorts of things under his care and\r\nsometimes even without his help  i have studied the estate map and i\r\nhave been over the estate books and read some of the leases and all such\r\nmatters which they deal with in the estate office  this only told me the\r\nbones of the thing  i wanted to know more of our people and so i made a\r\npoint of going now and again to each house that we own  of seeing the\r\npeople and talking with them familiarly as familiarly as they would let\r\nme and indeed so far as was possible considering my position  for\r\nauntie dear i soon began to learnto learn in a way there was no\r\nmistakingwhat my position is  and so i want to get to know more of\r\ntheir ordinary lives the darker as well as the lighter side  i would\r\nlike to do them good  i can see how my dear daddy has always been a sort\r\nof power to help them and i would like to carry on his work to carry it\r\nfurther if i may  but i must know\r\n\r\nher aunt had been listening with growing interest and with growing\r\nrespect too for she realised the intense earnestness which lay behind\r\nthe girls words and her immediate purpose  her voice and manner were\r\nboth softened\r\n\r\nbut my dear surely it is not necessary to go into the court to know\r\nthese things  the results of each case become known\r\n\r\nthat is just it auntie she answered quickly  the magistrates have\r\nto hear the two sides of the case before even they can make up their\r\nminds  i want to hear both sides too  if people are guilty i want to\r\nknow the cause of their guilt  if they are innocent i want to know what\r\nthe circumstances can be which make innocence look like guilt  in my own\r\ndaily life i may be in the way of just such judgments and surely it is\r\nonly right that judgment should be just\r\n\r\nagain she paused there rose before her mind that conversation in the\r\nchurchyard when harold had said that it was difficult for women to be\r\njust\r\n\r\nmiss rowly reflected too  she was becoming convinced that in principle\r\nthe girl was right  but the details were repugnant as ever to her\r\nconcentrating her mind on the point where she felt the ground firm under\r\nher she made her objection\r\n\r\nbut stephen dear there are so many cases that are sordid and painful\r\n\r\nthe more need to know of sordid things if sordidness plays so important\r\na part in the tragedy of their lives\r\n\r\nbut there are cases which are not within a womans province  cases that\r\ntouch sin    \r\n\r\nwhat kind of sin do you mean  surely all wrongdoing is sin  the old\r\nlady was embarrassed  not by the fact for she had been for too many\r\nyears the mistress of a great household not to know something of the\r\nsubject on which she spoke but that she had to speak of such a matter to\r\nthe young girl whom she so loved\r\n\r\nthe sin my dear of    of womans wrongdoing    as woman   \r\nof motherhood without marriage  all stephens nature seemed to rise in\r\nrevolt\r\n\r\nwhy auntie she spoke out at once you yourself show the want of the\r\nvery experience i look for\r\n\r\nhow what asked the old lady amazed and bristling  stephen took her\r\nhand and held it affectionately as she spoke\r\n\r\nyou speak of a womans wrongdoing when surely it is a mans as well\r\nthere does not seem to be blame for him who is the more guilty  only for\r\npoor women    and auntie dear it is such poor women that i should\r\nlike to help    not when it is too late but before  but how can i\r\nhelp unless i know  good girls cannot tell me and good women wont  you\r\nyourself auntie didnt want to speak on the subject even to me\r\n\r\nbut my dear child these are not things for unmarried women  i never\r\nspeak of them myself except with matrons  stephens answer flashed out\r\nlike a sword and cut like one\r\n\r\nand yet you are unmarried  oh auntie dear i did not and i do not mean\r\nto be offensive or to hurt you in any way  i know dear your goodness\r\nand your kindness to all  but you limit yourself to one side  the\r\nelder lady interrupted\r\n\r\nhow do you mean one side which side\r\n\r\nthe punishment side  i want to know the cause of that which brings the\r\npunishment  there surely is some cross road in a girls life where the\r\nways part  i want to stand there if i can with warning in one hand and\r\nhelp in the other  oh auntie auntie cant you see that my heart is in\r\nthis    these are our people daddy says they are to be my people and\r\ni want to know their lives right through to understand their wants and\r\ntheir temptations and their weakness  bad and good whatever it be i\r\nmust know it all or i shall be working in the dark and may injure or\r\ncrush where i had looked to help and raise\r\n\r\nas she spoke she looked glorified  the afternoon autumn sun shone full\r\nthrough the great window and lighted her up till she looked like a\r\nspirit  lighted her white diaphanous dress till it seemed to take shape\r\nas an ethereal robe lighted her red hair till it looked like a celestial\r\ncrown lighted her great dark eyes till their black beauty became swept\r\nin the tide of glory\r\n\r\nthe heart of the old woman who loved her best heaved and her bosom\r\nswelled with pride  instinctively she spoke\r\n\r\noh you noble beautiful creature  of course you are right and your\r\nway is gods way  with tears that rained down her furrowed cheeks she\r\nput her arms round the girl and kissed her fondly  still holding her in\r\nher arms she gave her the gentle counsel which was the aftermath of her\r\nmoment of inspiration\r\n\r\nbut stephen dear do be careful  knowledge is a twoedged sword and it\r\nis apt to side with pride  remember what was the last temptation of the\r\nserpent to eve your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods\r\nknowing good and evil\r\n\r\ni shall be very careful she said gravely and then added as if by an\r\nafterthought of course you understand that my motive is the acquisition\r\nof knowledge\r\n\r\nyes the answer was given interrogatively\r\n\r\ndont you think dear that eves object was not so much the acquisition\r\nof knowledge as the gratification of curiosity\r\n\r\nthat may be said the elder lady in a doubtful tone but my dear who\r\nis to enlighten us as to which is which  we are apt in such matters to\r\ndeceive ourselves  the more we know the better are we able to deceive\r\nothers and the better we are able to deceive others the better we are\r\nable to deceive ourselves  as i tell you dear knowledge is twoedged\r\nand needs extra carefulness in its use\r\n\r\ntrue said stephen reflectively  long after her aunt had gone she sat\r\nthinking\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nonce again did miss rowly try to restrain stephen from a project  this\r\nwas when a little later she wished to go for a few days to the university\r\nmission house in the east end of london  ever since her visit to oxford\r\nshe had kept up a correspondence with her mothers old friend  it was\r\nthis ladys habit to spend a part of vacation in the mission and stephen\r\nhad had much correspondence with her regarding the work  at last she\r\nwrote that if she might she would like to come and see for herself  the\r\nanswer was a cordial invitation armed with which she asked her father to\r\nallow her to go  he at once assented  he had been watching keenly the\r\ndevelopment of her character and had seen with pride and satisfaction\r\nthat as time went on she seemed to acquire greater resolution larger\r\nselfdependence  she was becoming more and more of his ideal  without\r\nlosing any of her womanhood she was beginning to look at things more\r\nfrom a mans point of view than is usually done by or possible to\r\nwomen\r\n\r\nwhen she returned at the end of a week she was full of new gravity  after\r\na while this so far changed that her old lighter moods began to have\r\ntheir place but it seemed that she never lost and that she never would\r\nlose the effect of that week of bitter experience amongst the submerged\r\ntenth\r\n\r\nthe effect of the mental working was shown by a remark made by harold\r\nwhen home on his next college vacation  he had been entering with her on\r\na discussion of an episode on the estate\r\n\r\nstephen you are learning to be just\r\n\r\nat the moment she was chagrined by the remark though she accepted it in\r\nsilence but later when she had thought the matter over she took from\r\nit infinite pleasure  this was indeed to share mans ideas and to think\r\nwith the workings of mans mind  it encouraged her to further and larger\r\nideas and to a greater toleration than she had hitherto dreamed of\r\n\r\nof all those who loved her none seemed to understand so fully as\r\nlaetitia rowly the change in her mental attitude or rather the\r\ndevelopment of it  now and again she tried to deflect or modify certain\r\ncoming forces so that the educational process in which she had always\r\nhad a part would continue in the right direction  but she generally\r\nfound that the girl had been over the ground so thoroughly that she was\r\nable to defend her position  once when she had ventured to remonstrate\r\nwith her regarding her attitude of womans equality with man she felt as\r\nif stephens barque was indeed entering on dangerous seas  the occasion\r\nhad arisen thus stephen had been what her aunt had stigmatised as\r\nlaying down the law with regard to the position a married woman and\r\nmiss rowly seeing a good argumentative opening remarked\r\n\r\nbut what if a woman does not get the opportunity of being married\r\nstephen looked at her a moment before saying with conviction\r\n\r\nit is a womans fault if she does not get the opportunity  the old\r\nlady smiled as she answered\r\n\r\nher fault  my dear what if no man asks her  this seemed to her own\r\nmind a poser\r\n\r\nstill her own fault  why doesnt she ask him  her aunts lorgnon was\r\ndropped in horrified amazement\r\n\r\nstephen went on impassively\r\n\r\ncertainly  why shouldnt she  marriage is a union  as it is in the\r\neye of the law a civil contract either party to it should be at liberty\r\nto originate the matter  if a woman is not free to think of a man in all\r\nways how is she to judge of the suitability of their union  and if she\r\nis free in theory why not free to undertake if necessary the initiative\r\nin a matter so momentous to herself  the old lady actually groaned and\r\nwrung her hands she was horrified at such sentiments  they were daring\r\nenough to think but to put them in words   \r\n\r\noh my dear my dear she moaned be careful what you say  some one\r\nmight hear you who would not understand as i do that you are talking\r\ntheory  stephens habit of thought stood to her here  she saw that her\r\naunt was distressed and as she did not wish to pain her unduly was\r\nwilling to divert the immediate channel of her fear  she took the hand\r\nwhich lay in her lap and held it firmly whilst she smiled in the loving\r\nold eyes\r\n\r\nof course auntie dear it is theory  but still it is a theory which i\r\nhold very strongly    here a thought struck her and she said\r\nsuddenly\r\n\r\ndid you ever    how many proposals did you have auntie  the old\r\nlady smiled her thoughts were already diverted\r\n\r\nseveral my dear  it is so long ago that i dont remember\r\n\r\noh yes you do auntie  no woman ever forgets that no matter what else\r\nshe may or may not remember  tell me wont you  the old lady blushed\r\nslightly as she answered\r\n\r\nthere is no need to specify my dear  let it be at this that there\r\nwere more than you could count on your right hand\r\n\r\nand why did you refuse them  the tone was wheedling and the elder\r\nwoman loved to hear it  wheedling is the courtship by the young of the\r\nold\r\n\r\nbecause my dear i didnt love them\r\n\r\nbut tell me auntie was there never any one that you did love\r\n\r\nah my dear that is a different matter  that is the real tragedy of a\r\nwomans life  in flooding reminiscent thought she forgot her\r\nremonstrating her voice became full of natural pathos\r\n\r\nto love and be helpless  to wait and wait and wait with your heart\r\nall aflame  to hope and hope till time seems to have passed away and\r\nall the world to stand still on your hopeless misery  to know that a\r\nword might open up heaven and yet to have to remain mute  to keep back\r\nthe glances that could enlighten to modulate the tones that might\r\nbetray  to see all you hoped for passing away    to another    \r\n\r\nstephen bent over and kissed her then standing up said\r\n\r\ni understand  isnt it wrong auntie that there should be such\r\ntragedies  should not that glance be given  why should that tone be\r\nchecked  why should one be mute when a single word might would avert\r\nthe tragedy  is it not possible auntie that there is something wrong\r\nin our social system when such things can happen and can happen so\r\noften\r\n\r\nshe looked remorseless as well as irresistible in the pride of her\r\nyouthful strength as with eyes that blazed not flashing as in passion\r\nbut with a steady light that seemed to burn she continued\r\n\r\nsome day women must learn their own strength as well as they have\r\nlearned their own weakness  they are taught this latter from their\r\ncradles up but no one ever seems to teach them wherein their power lies\r\nthey have to learn this for themselves and the process and the result of\r\nthe selfteaching are not good  in the university settlement i learned\r\nmuch that made my heart ache but out of it there seemed some lesson for\r\ngood  she paused and her aunt wishing to keep the subject towards\r\nhigher things asked\r\n\r\nand that lesson stephen dear  the blazing eyes turned to her so that\r\nshe was stirred by them as the answer came\r\n\r\nit is bad women who seem to know men best and to be able to influence\r\nthem most  they can make men come and go at will  they can turn and\r\ntwist and mould them as they choose  and they never hesitate to speak\r\ntheir own wishes to ask for what they want  there are no tragedies of\r\nthe negative kind in their lives  their tragedies have come and gone\r\nalready and their power remains  why should good women leave power to\r\nsuch as they  why should good womens lives be wrecked for a convention\r\nwhy in the blind following of some society fetish should life lose its\r\ncharm its possibilities  why should love eat its heart out in vain\r\nthe time will come when women will not be afraid to speak to men as they\r\nshould speak as free and equal  surely if a woman is to be the equal\r\nand lifelong companion of a man the closest to himnay the only one\r\nreally close to him the mother of his childrenshe should be free at\r\nthe very outset to show her inclination to him just as he would to her\r\ndont be frightened auntie dear your eyes are paining me    there\r\nperhaps i said too much  but after all it is only theory  take for your\r\ncomfort auntie dear that i am free an heartwhole  you need not fear\r\nfor me i can see what your dear eyes tell me  yes  i am very young\r\nperhaps too young to think such things  but i have thought of them\r\nthought them all over in every way and phase i can imagine\r\n\r\nshe stopped suddenly bending over she took the old lady in her arms and\r\nkissed her fondly several times holding her tight  then as suddenly\r\nreleasing her she ran away before she could say a word\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter viiithe tcart\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen harold took his degree stephens father took her to cambridge  she\r\nenjoyed the trip very much indeed it seemed under conditions that were\r\nabsolutely happy\r\n\r\nwhen they had returned to normanstand the squire took an early\r\nopportunity of bringing harold alone into his study  he spoke to him\r\nwith what in a very young man would have seemed diffidence\r\n\r\ni have been thinking harold that the time has come when you should be\r\naltogether your own master  i am more than pleased my boy with the way\r\nyou have gone through college it is i am sure just as your dear father\r\nwould have wished it and as it would have pleased him best  he paused\r\nand harold said in a low voice\r\n\r\ni tried hard sir to do what i thought he would like and what you\r\nwould  the squire went on more cheerfully\r\n\r\ni know that my boy  i know that well  and i can tell you that it is\r\nnot the least of the pleasures we have all had in your success how you\r\nhave justified yourself  you have won many honours in the schools and\r\nyou have kept the reputation as an athlete which your father was so proud\r\nof  well i suppose in the natural order of things you would go into a\r\nprofession and of course if you so desire you can do that  but if you\r\ncan see your way to it i would rather that you stayed here  my house is\r\nyour home as long as i live but i dont wish you to feel in any way\r\ndependent  i want you to stay here if you will but to do it just\r\nbecause you wish to  to this end i have made over to you the estate at\r\ncamp which was my fathers gift to me when i came of age  it is not a\r\nvery large one but it will give you a nice position of your own and a\r\ncomfortable income  and with it goes my blessing my dear boy  take it\r\nas a gift from your father and myself\r\n\r\nharold was much moved not only by the act itself but by the gracious way\r\nof doing it  there were tears in his eyes as he wrung the squires hand\r\nhis voice thrilled with feeling as he said\r\n\r\nyour many goodnesses to my fathers son sir will i hope be justified\r\nby his love and loyalty  if i dont say much it is because i do not feel\r\nquite master of myself  i shall try to show in time as i cannot say it\r\nall at once all that i feel\r\n\r\nharold continued to live at normanstand  the house at camp was in\r\nreality a charming cottage  a couple of servants were installed and now\r\nand again he stayed there for a few days as he wished to get accustomed\r\nto the place  in a couple of months every one accepted the order of\r\nthings and life at normanstand went on much as it had done before harold\r\nhad gone to college  there was a man in the house now instead of a boy\r\nthat was all  stephen too was beginning to be a young woman but the\r\nrelative positions were the same as they had been  her growth did not\r\nseem to make an ostensible difference to any one  the one who might have\r\nnoticed it most mrs jarrold had died during the last year of harolds\r\nlife at college\r\n\r\nwhen the day came for the quarterly meeting of the magistrates of the\r\ncounty of norcester squire rowly arranged as usual to drive squire\r\nnorman  this had been their habit for good many years  the two men\r\nusually liked to talk over the meeting as they returned home together  it\r\nwas a beautiful morning for a drive and when rowly came flying up the\r\navenue in his tcart with three magnificent bays stephen ran out on the\r\ntop of the steps to see him draw up  rowly was a fine whip and his\r\nhorses felt it  squire norman was ready and after a kiss from stephen\r\nclimbed into the high cart  the men raised their hats and waved good\r\nbye  a word from rowly with a bound the horses were off  stephen stood\r\nlooking at them delighted all was so sunny so bright so happy  the\r\nworld was so full of life and happiness today that it seemed as if it\r\nwould never end that nothing except good could befall\r\n\r\nharold later on that morning was to go into norcester also so stephen\r\nwith a lonely day before her set herself to take up looseends of all\r\nsorts of little personal matters  they would all meet at dinner as rowly\r\nwas to stop the night at normanstand\r\n\r\nharold left the club in good time to ride home to dinner  as he passed\r\nthe county hotel he stopped to ask if squire norman had left and was\r\ntold that he had started only a short time before with squire rowly in\r\nhis tcart  he rode on fast thinking that perhaps he might overtake\r\nthem and ride on with them  but the bays knew their work and did it\r\nthey kept their start it was only at the top of the north hill five\r\nmiles out of norcester that he saw them in the distance flying along\r\nthe level road  he knew he would not now overtake them and so rode on\r\nsomewhat more leisurely\r\n\r\nthe norcester highroad when it has passed the village of brackling\r\nturns away to the right behind the great clump of oaks  from this the\r\nroad twists to the left again making a double curve and then runs to\r\nnorling parva in a clear stretch of some miles before reaching the sharp\r\nturn down the hill which is marked dangerous to cyclists  from the\r\nlatter village branches the byroad over the hill which is the short cut\r\nto normanstand\r\n\r\nwhen harold turned the corner under the shadow of the oaks he saw a\r\nbelated roadmender surrounded by some gaping peasants pointing\r\nexcitedly in the distance  the man who of course knew him called to\r\nhim to stop\r\n\r\nwhat is it he asked reining up\r\n\r\nit be squire rowlys bays which have run away with him  three on em\r\nall in a row and comin like the wind  squire he had his reins all\r\nright but they osses didnt seem to mind un  they was fair mad and\r\nbolted  the leader he had got frightened at the heap o stones theer\r\nan the others took scare from him\r\n\r\nwithout a word harold shook his reins and touched the horse with his\r\nwhip  the animal seemed to understand and sprang forward covering the\r\nground at a terrific pace  harold was not given to alarms but here\r\nmight be serious danger  three spirited horses in a light cart made for\r\npace all bolting in fright might end any moment in calamity  never in\r\nhis life did he ride faster than on the road to norling parva  far ahead\r\nof him he could see at the turn now and again a figure running\r\nsomething had happened  his heart grew cold he knew as well as though\r\nhe had seen it the high cart swaying on one wheel round the corner as\r\nthe maddened horses tore on their way the one jerk too much and the\r\nmomentary reaction in the crash   \r\n\r\nwith beating heart and eyes aflame in his white face he dashed on\r\n\r\nit was all too true  by the side of the roadway on the inner curve lay\r\nthe cart on its side with broken shafts  the horses were prancing and\r\nstamping about along the roadway not recovered from their fright  each\r\nwas held by several men\r\n\r\nand on the grass two figures were still lying where they had been thrown\r\nout  rowly who had of course been on the offside had been thrown\r\nfurthest  his head had struck the milestone that stood back on the waste\r\nground before the ditch  there was no need for any one to tell that his\r\nneck had been broken  the way his head lay on one side and the twisted\r\ninert limbs all told their story plainly enough\r\n\r\nsquire norman lay on his back stretched out  some one had raised him to\r\na sitting posture and then lowered him again straightening his limbs  he\r\ndid not therefore look so dreadful as rowly but there were signs of\r\ncoming death in the stertorous breathing the ooze of blood from nostrils\r\nand ears as well as mouth  harold knelt down by him at once and examined\r\nhim  those who were round all knew him and stood back  he felt the ribs\r\nand limbs so far as he could ascertain by touch no bone was broken\r\n\r\njust then the local doctor for whom some one had run arrived in his\r\ngig  he too knelt beside the injured man a quick glance having\r\nsatisfied him that there was only one patient requiring his care  harold\r\nstood up and waited  the doctor looked up shaking his head  harold\r\ncould hardly suppress the groan which was rising in his throat  he\r\nasked\r\n\r\nis it immediate  should his daughter be brought here\r\n\r\nhow long would it take her to arrive\r\n\r\nperhaps half an hour she would not lose an instant\r\n\r\nthen you had better send for her\r\n\r\ni shall go at once answered harold turning to jump on his horse\r\nwhich was held on the road\r\n\r\nno no said the doctor send some one else  you had better stay here\r\nyourself  he may become conscious just before the end and he may want\r\nto say something  it seemed to harold that a great bell was sounding in\r\nhis earsbefore the end  good god  poor stephen    but this was\r\nno time for sorrow or for thinking of it  that would come later  all\r\nthat was possible must be done and to do it required a cool head  he\r\ncalled to one of the lads he knew could ride and said to him\r\n\r\nget on my horse and ride as fast as you can to normanstand  send at\r\nonce to miss norman and tell her that she is wanted instantly  tell her\r\nthat there has been an accident that her father is alive but that she\r\nmust come at once without a moments delay  she had better ride my horse\r\nback as it will save time  she will understand from that the importance\r\nof time  quick\r\n\r\nthe lad sprang to the saddle and was off in a flash  whilst harold was\r\nspeaking the doctor had told the men who accustomed to hunting\r\naccidents had taken a gate from its hinges and held it in readiness to\r\nbring it closer  then under his direction the squire was placed on the\r\ngate  the nearest house was only about a hundred yards away and thither\r\nthey bore him  he was lifted on a bed and then the doctor made fuller\r\nexamination  when he stood up he looked very grave and said to harold\r\n\r\ni greatly fear she cannot arrive in time  that bleeding from the ears\r\nmeans rupture of the brain  it is relieving the pressure however and\r\nhe may recover consciousness before he dies  you had better be close to\r\nhim  there is at present nothing that can be done  if he becomes\r\nconscious at all it will be suddenly  he will relapse and probably die\r\nas quickly\r\n\r\nall at once norman opened his eyes and seeing him said quietly as he\r\nlooked around\r\n\r\nwhat place is this harold\r\n\r\nmartinsjames martins sir  you were brought here after the\r\naccident\r\n\r\nyes i remember  am i badly hurt  i can feel nothing\r\n\r\ni fear so sir  i have sent for stephen\r\n\r\nsent for stephen  am i about to die  his voice though feeble was\r\ngrave and even\r\n\r\nalas sir i fear so  he sank on his knees as he spoke and took him\r\nhis second father in his arms\r\n\r\nis it close\r\n\r\nyes\r\n\r\nthen listen to me  if i dont see stephen give her my love and\r\nblessing  say that with my last breath i prayed god to keep her and make\r\nher happy  you will tell her this\r\n\r\ni will  i will  he could hardly speak for the emotion which was\r\nchoking him  then the voice went on but slower and weaker\r\n\r\nand harold my dear boy you will look after her will you not  guard\r\nher and cherish her as if you were indeed my son and she your sister\r\n\r\ni will  so help me god  there was a pause of a few seconds which\r\nseemed an interminable time  then in a feebler voice squire norman spoke\r\nagain\r\n\r\nand haroldbend downi must whisper  if it should be that in time you\r\nand stephen should find that there is another affection between you\r\nremember that i sanction itwith my dying breath  but give her time  i\r\ntrust that to you  she is young and the world is all before her  let\r\nher choose    and be loyal to her if it is another  it may be a hard\r\ntask but i trust you harold  god bless you my other son  he rose\r\nslightly and listened  harolds heart leaped  the swift hoofstrokes of\r\na galloping horse were heard    the father spoke joyously\r\n\r\nthere she is  that is my brave girl  god grant that she may be in\r\ntime  i know what it will mean to her hereafter\r\n\r\nthe horse stopped suddenly\r\n\r\na quick patter of feet along the passage and then stephen half dressed\r\nwith a peignoir thrown over her swept into the room  with the soft\r\nagility of a leopard she threw herself on her knees beside her father and\r\nput her arms round him  the dying man motioned to harold to raise him\r\nwhen this had been done he laid his hand tenderly on his daughters head\r\nsaying\r\n\r\nlet now o lord thy servant depart in peace  god bless and keep you\r\nmy dear child  you have been all your life a joy and a delight to me  i\r\nshall tell your mother when i meet her all that you have been to me\r\nharold be good to her  goodbyestephen    margaret    \r\n\r\nhis head fell over and harold laying him gently down knelt beside\r\nstephen  he put his arm round her and she turning to him laid her\r\nhand on his breast and sobbed as though her heart would break\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nthe bodies of the two squires were brought to normanstand  rowly had\r\nlong ago said that if he died unmarried he would like to lie beside his\r\nhalfsister and that it was fitting that as stephen would be the new\r\nsquire of norwood her dust should in time lie by his  when the terrible\r\nnews of her nephews and of normans death came to norwood miss laetitia\r\nhurried off to normanstand as fast as the horses could bring her\r\n\r\nher coming was an inexpressible comfort to stephen  after the first\r\noverwhelming burst of grief she had settled into an acute despair  of\r\ncourse she had been helped by the fact that harold had been with her and\r\nshe was grateful for that too  but it did not live in her memory of\r\ngratitude in the same way  of course harold was with her in trouble  he\r\nhad always been would always be\r\n\r\nbut the comfort which aunt laetitia could give was of a more positive\r\nkind\r\n\r\nfrom that hour miss rowly stayed at normanstand  stephen wanted her and\r\nshe wanted to be with stephen\r\n\r\nafter the funeral harold with an instinctive delicacy of feeling had\r\ngone to live in his own house but he came to normanstand every day\r\nstephen had so long been accustomed to consulting him about everything\r\nthat there was no perceptible change in their relations  even necessary\r\nbusiness to be done did not come as a new thing\r\n\r\nand so things went on outwardly at normanstand very much as they had done\r\nbefore the coming of the tragedy  but for a long time stephen had\r\noccasional bursts of grief which to witness was positive anguish to those\r\nwho loved her\r\n\r\nthen her duty towards her neighbours became a sort of passion  she did\r\nnot spare herself by day or by night  with swift intuition she grasped\r\nthe needs of any ill case which came before her and with swift movement\r\nshe took the remedy in hand\r\n\r\nher aunt saw and approved  stephen she felt was in this way truly\r\nfulfilling her duty as a woman  the old lady began to secretly hope and\r\nalmost to believe that she had laid aside those theories whose carrying\r\ninto action she so dreaded\r\n\r\nbut theories do not die so easily  it is from theory that practice takes\r\nits real strength as well as its direction  and did the older woman\r\nwhose life had been bound under more orderly restraint but know stephen\r\nwas following out her theories remorselessly and to the end\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter ixin the spring\r\n\r\n\r\nthe months since her fathers death spread into the second year before\r\nstephen began to realise the loneliness of her life  she had no\r\ncompanion now but her aunt and though the old lady adored her and she\r\nreturned her love in full the mere years between them made impossible\r\nthe companionship that youth craves  miss rowlys life was in the past\r\nstephens was in the future  and loneliness is a feeling which comes\r\nunbidden to a heart\r\n\r\nstephen felt her loneliness all round  in old days harold was always\r\nwithin hail and companionship of equal age and understanding was\r\navailable  but now his very reticence in her own interest and by her\r\nfathers wishes made for her pain  harold had put his strongest\r\nrestraint on himself and in his own way suffered a sort of silent\r\nmartyrdom  he loved stephen with every fibre of his being  day by day\r\nhe came toward her with eager step day by day he left her with a pang\r\nthat made his heart ache and seemed to turn the brightness of the day to\r\ngloom  night by night he tossed for hours thinking thinking wondering\r\nif the time would ever come when her kisses would be his    but the\r\ntortures and terrors of the night had their effect on his days  it\r\nseemed as if the mere act of thinking of longing gave him ever renewed\r\nselfcontrol so that he was able in his bearing to carry out the task he\r\nhad undertaken to give stephen time to choose a mate for herself  herein\r\nlay his weaknessa weakness coming from his want of knowledge of the\r\nworld of women  had he ever had a love affair be it never so mild a\r\none he would have known that love requires a positive expression  it is\r\nnot sufficient to sigh and wish and hope and long all to oneself\r\nstephen felt instinctively that his guarded speech and manner were due to\r\nthe coldnessor rather the trusting abated worshipof the brotherhood\r\nto which she had been always accustomed  at the time when new forces\r\nwere manifesting and expanding themselves within her when her growing\r\ninstincts cultivated by the senses and the passions of young nature\r\nmade her aware of other forces new and old expanding themselves outside\r\nher at the time when the heart of a girl is eager for new impressions\r\nand new expansions and the calls of sex are working within her all\r\nunconsciously harold to whom her heart would probably have been the\r\nfirst to turn made himself in his effort to best show his love a\r\nquantite negligeable\r\n\r\nthus stephen whilst feeling that the vague desires of budding womanhood\r\nwere trembling within her had neither thought nor knowledge of their\r\ncharacter or their ultimate tendency  she would have been shocked\r\nhorrified had that logical process which she applied so freely to less\r\npersonal matters been used upon her own intimate nature  in her case\r\nlogic would of course act within a certain range and as logic is a\r\nconscious intellectual process she became aware that her objective was\r\nman  manin the abstract  man not a man  beyond that she could\r\nnot go  it is not too much to say that she did not ever even in her\r\nmost errant thought apply her reasoning or even dream of its following\r\nout either the duties the responsibilities or the consequences of\r\nhaving a husband  she had a vague longing for younger companionship and\r\nof the kind naturally most interesting to her  there thought stopped\r\n\r\none only of her male acquaintances did not at this time appear  leonard\r\neverard who had some time ago finished his course at college was living\r\npartly in london and partly on the continent  his very absence made him\r\nof added interest to his old playfellow  the image of his grace and\r\ncomeliness of his dominance and masculine force early impressed on her\r\nmind began to compare favourably with the actualities of her other\r\nfriends those of them at least who were within the circle of her\r\npersonal interest  absence makes the heart grow fonder  in stephens\r\nmind had been but a very mustardseed of fondness  but new lights were\r\nbreaking for her and all of them in greater or lesser degree shone in\r\nturn on the memory of the pretty selfwilled dominant boy who now grew\r\nlarger and more masculine in stature under the instance of each\r\nsuccessive light  stephen knew the others fairly well through and\r\nthrough  the usual mixture of good and evil of strength and weakness\r\nof purpose and vacillation was quite within the scope of her own feeling\r\nand of her observation  but this man was something of a problem to her\r\nand as such had a prominence in her thoughts quite beyond his own\r\nworthiness\r\n\r\nin movement of some form is life and even ideas grow when the pulses\r\nbeat and thought quickens  stephen had long had in her mind the idea of\r\nsexual equality  for a long time in deference to her aunts feelings\r\nshe had not spoken of it for the old lady winced in general under any\r\nsuggestion of a breach of convention  but though her outward expression\r\nbeing thus curbed had helped to suppress or minimise the opportunities of\r\ninward thought the idea had never left her  now when sex was\r\nconsciously or unconsciously a dominating factor in her thoughts the\r\ndormant idea woke to new life  she had held that if men and women were\r\nequal the woman should have equal rights and opportunities as the man  it\r\nhad been she believed an absurd conventional rule that such a thing as\r\na proposal of marriage should be entirely the prerogative of man\r\n\r\nand then came to her as it ever does to woman opportunity  opportunity\r\nthe cruelest most remorseless most unsparing subtlest foe that\r\nwomanhood has  here was an opportunity for her to test her own theory\r\nto prove to herself and others that she was right  theythey being\r\nthe impersonal opponents of or unbelievers in her theorywould see\r\nthat a woman could propose as well as a man and that the result would be\r\ngood\r\n\r\nit is a part of selfsatisfaction and perhaps not the least dangerous\r\npart of it that it has an increasing or multiplying power of its own\r\nthe desire to do increases the power to do and desire and power united\r\nfind new ways for the exercise of strength  up to now stephens\r\ninclination towards leonard had been vague nebulous but now that theory\r\nshowed a way to its utilisation it forthwith began to become first\r\ndefinite then concrete then substantial  when once the idea had become\r\na possibility the mere passing of time did the rest\r\n\r\nher aunt sawand misunderstood  the lesson of her own youth had not\r\nbeen applied not even of those long hours and days and weeks at which\r\nshe hinted when she had spoken of the tragedy of life which by inference\r\nwas her own tragedy to love and to be helpless  to wait and wait and\r\nwait with your heart all aflame\r\n\r\nstephen recognised her aunts concern for her health in time to protect\r\nherself from the curiosity of her lovingkindness  her youth and\r\nreadiness and adaptability and that power of playacting which we all\r\nhave within us and of which she had her share stood to her  with but\r\nlittle effort based on a seeming acquiescence in her aunts views she\r\nsucceeded in convincing the old lady that her incipient feverish cold had\r\nalready reached its crisis and was passing away  but she had gained\r\ncertain knowledge in the playing of her little part  all this\r\nselfprotective instinct was new for good or ill she had advanced one\r\nmore step in not only the knowledge but the power of duplicity which is\r\nso necessary in the conventional life of a woman\r\n\r\noh did we but see  could we but see  here was a woman dowered in her\r\nyouth with all the goods and graces in the power of the gods to bestow\r\nwho fought against convention and who yet found in convention the\r\nstrongest as well as the readiest weapon of defence\r\n\r\nfor nearly two weeks stephens resolution was held motionless neither\r\nadvancing nor receding it was veritably the slack water of her\r\nresolution  she was afraid to go on  not afraid in sense of fear as it\r\nis usually understood but with the opposition of virginal instincts\r\nthose instincts which are natural but whose uses as well as whose powers\r\nare unknown to us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xthe resolve\r\n\r\n\r\nthe next few days saw stephen abnormally restless  she had fairly well\r\nmade up her mind to test her theory of equality of the sexes by asking\r\nleonard everard to marry her but her difficulty was as to the doing it\r\nshe knew well that it would not do to depend on a chance meeting for an\r\nopportunity  after all the matter was too serious to allow of the\r\npossibility of levity  there were times when she thought she would write\r\nto him and make her proffer of affection in this way but on every\r\noccasion when such thought recurred it was forthwith instantly abandoned\r\nduring the last few days however she became more reconciled to even\r\nthis method of procedure  the fever of growth was unabated  at last\r\ncame an evening which she had all to herself  miss laetitia was going\r\nover to norwood to look after matters there and would remain the night\r\nstephen saw in her absence an opportunity for thought and action and\r\nsaid that having a headache she would remain at home  her aunt offered\r\nto postpone her visit  but she would not hear of it and so she had the\r\nevening to herself\r\n\r\nafter dinner in her boudoir she set herself to the composition of a\r\nletter to leonard which would convey at least something of her feelings\r\nand wishes towards him  in the depths of her heart which now and again\r\nbeat furiously she had a secret hope that when once the idea was\r\nbroached leonard would do the rest  and as she thought of that rest a\r\nlanguorous dreaminess came upon her  she thought how he would come to\r\nher full of love of yearning passion how she would try to keep towards\r\nhim at first an independent front which would preserve her secret\r\nanxiety until the time should come when she might yield herself to his\r\narms and tell him all  for hours she wrote letter after letter\r\ndestroying them as quickly as she wrote as she found that she had but\r\nswayed pendulum fashion between overtness and coldness  some of the\r\nletters were so chilly in tone that she felt they would defeat their own\r\nobject  others were so frankly warm in the expression ofregard she\r\ncalled it that with burning blushes she destroyed them at once at the\r\ncandle before her\r\n\r\nat last she made up her mind  just as she had done when a baby she\r\nrealised that the opposing forces were too strong for her she gave in\r\ngracefully  it would not do to deal directly in a letter with the matter\r\nin hand  she would write to leonard merely asking him to see her  then\r\nwhen they were together without fear of interruption she would tell him\r\nher views\r\n\r\nshe got as far as dear mr leonard when she stood up saying to\r\nherself\r\n\r\ni shall not be in a hurry  i must sleep on it before i write  she\r\ntook up the novel she had been reading in the afternoon and read on at\r\nit steadily till her bedtime\r\n\r\nthat night she did not sleep  it was not that she was agitated  indeed\r\nshe was more at ease than she had been for days she had after much\r\nanxious thought made up her mind to a definite course of action\r\ntherefore her sleeplessness was not painful  it was rather that she did\r\nnot want to sleep than that she could not  she lay still thinking\r\nthinking dreaming such dreams as are the occasions of sanctified privacy\r\nto her age and sex\r\n\r\nin the morning she was no worse for her vigil  when at luncheontime\r\naunt laetitia had returned she went into all the little matters of which\r\nshe had to report  it was after teatime when she found herself alone\r\nand with leisure to attend to what was she felt directly her own\r\naffair  during the night she had made up her mind exactly what to say to\r\nleonard and as her specific resolution bore the test of daylight she was\r\nsatisfied  the opening words had in their inception caused her some\r\nconcern but after hours of thought she had come to the conclusion that\r\nto address under the circumstance the recipient of the letter as dear\r\nmr everard would hardly do  the only possible justification of her\r\nunconventional act was that there existed already a friendship an\r\nintimacy of years since childhood that there were already between them\r\nknowledge and understanding of each other that what she was doing and\r\nabout to do was but a further step in a series of events long ago\r\nundertaken\r\n\r\nshe thought it better to send by post rather than messenger as the\r\nlatter did away with all privacy with regard to the act\r\n\r\nthe letter was as follows\r\n\r\n   dear leonardwould it be convenient for you to meet me tomorrow\r\n   tuesday at halfpast twelve oclock on the top of caester hill  i\r\n   want to speak about a matter that may have some interest to you and\r\n   it will be more private there than in the house  also it will be\r\n   cooler in the shade on the hilltop\r\n\r\n   yours sincerely stephen norman\r\n\r\nhaving posted the letter she went about the usual routine of her life at\r\nnormanstand and no occasion of suspicion or remark regarding her came to\r\nher aunt\r\n\r\nin her room that night when she had sent away her maid she sat down to\r\nthink and all the misgivings of the day came back  one by one they were\r\nconquered by one protective argument\r\n\r\ni am free to do as i like  i am my own mistress and i am doing nothing\r\nthat is wrong  even if it is unconventional what of that  god knows\r\nthere are enough conventions in the world that are wrong hopelessly\r\nunalterably wrong  after all who are the people who are most bound by\r\nconvention  those who call themselves smart  if convention is the god\r\nof the smart set then it is about time that honest people chose\r\nanother\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nleonard received the letter at breakfasttime  he did not give it any\r\nspecial attention as he had other letters at the same time some of\r\nwhich were if less pleasant of more immediate importance  he had of\r\nlate been bombarded with dunning letters from tradesmen for during his\r\nuniversity life and ever since he had run into debt  the moderate\r\nallowance his father made him he had treated as cash for incidental\r\nexpenses but everything else had been on credit  indeed he was\r\nbeginning to get seriously alarmed about the future for his father who\r\nhad paid his debts once and at a time when they were by comparison\r\ninconsiderable had said that he would not under any circumstances pay\r\nothers  he was not sorry therefore for an opportunity of getting away\r\nfor a few hours from home from himselffrom anxieties possibilities\r\nthe morning was a sweltering one and he grumbled to himself as he set\r\nout on his journey through the woods\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nstephen rose fresh and in good spirits despite her sleepless night  when\r\nyouth and strength are to the fore a nights sleep is not of much\r\naccount for the system once braced up is not allowed to slacken  it was\r\na notable sign of her strong nature that she was not even impatient but\r\nwaited with calm fixity the hour at which she had asked leonard everard\r\nto meet her  it is true that as the time grew closer her nerve was less\r\nmarked  and just before it she was a girland nothing more with all\r\ngirls diffidence a girls selfdistrust a girls abnegation a girls\r\nplasticity\r\n\r\nin the more purely personal aspect of her enterprise stephens effort was\r\nmore conscious  it is hardly possible for a pretty woman to seek in her\r\nstudy of perfection the aid of her mirror and to be unconscious of her\r\naims  there must certainly be at least one dominant purpose the\r\nachievement of success  stephen did not attempt to deny her own beauty\r\non the contrary she gave it the fullest scope  there was a certain\r\ntriumph in her glance as she took her last look in her mirror a\r\ngratification of her wish to show herself in the best way possible  it\r\nwas a very charming picture which the mirror reflected\r\n\r\nit may be that there is a companionship in a mirror especially to a\r\nwoman that the reflection of oneself is an emboldening presence a\r\npersonality which is better than the actuality of an unvalued stranger\r\ncertainly when stephen closed the door and stood in the wainscoted\r\npassage which was only dimly lit by the high window at either end her\r\ncourage seemed at once to ooze away\r\n\r\nprobably for the first time in her life as she left the shade of the\r\nlong passage and came out on the staircase flooded with the light of the\r\nnoonday sun stephen felt that she was a girlgirl standing as some\r\nsort of synonym for weakness pretended or actual  fear in whatever\r\nform or degree it may come is a vital quality and must move  it cannot\r\nstand at a fixed point if it be not sent backward it must progress\r\nstephen felt this and though her whole nature was repugnant to the\r\ntask forced herself to the effort of repression  it would she felt\r\nhave been to her a delicious pleasure to have abandoned all effort to\r\nhave sunk in the lassitude of selfsurrender\r\n\r\nthe woman in her was working her sex had found her out\r\n\r\nshe turned and looked around her as though conscious of being watched\r\nthen seeing that she was alone she went her way with settled purpose\r\nwith flashing eyes and glowing cheeksand a beating heart  a heart all\r\nwomans since it throbbed the most with apprehension when the enemy man\r\nwas the objective of her most resolute attack  she knew that she must\r\nkeep moving that she must not stop or pause or her whole resolution\r\nmust collapse  and so she hurried on fearful lest a chance meeting with\r\nany one might imperil her purpose\r\n\r\non she went through the faint mossgreen paths through meadows rich with\r\nflowering grasses and the many reds of the summer wildflowers  and so\r\nup through the path cut in the natural dipping of the rock that rose over\r\ncaester hill and formed a strong base for the clump of great trees that\r\nmade a landmark for many a mile around  during the first part of her\r\njourney between the house and the hilltop she tried to hold her purpose\r\nat arms length it would be sufficient to face its terrors when the time\r\nhad come  in the meantime the matter was of such overwhelming importance\r\nthat nothing else could take its place all she could do was to suspend\r\nthe active part of the thinking faculties and leave the mind only\r\nreceptive\r\n\r\nbut when she had passed through the thin belt of stunted oak and beech\r\nwhich hedged in the last of the lush meadows and caught sight of the\r\nclump of trees on the hilltop she unconsciously braced herself as a\r\nyoung regiment loses its tremors when the sight of the enemy breaks upon\r\nit  no longer her eyes fell earthward they were raised and raised\r\nproudly  stephen norman was fixed in her intention  like the woman of\r\nold her feet were on the ploughshares and she would not hesitate\r\n\r\nas she drew near the appointed place her pace grew slower and slower the\r\nwoman in her was unconsciously manifesting itself  she would not be\r\nfirst in her tryst with a man  unconsciousness however is not a\r\nworking quality which can be relied upon for staying power the approach\r\nto the trystingplace brought once more home to her the strange nature of\r\nher enterprise  she had made up her mind to it there was no use in\r\ndeceiving herself  what she had undertaken to do was much more\r\nunconventional than being first at a meeting  it was foolish and weak to\r\ndelay  the last thought braced her up and it was with a hurried gait\r\nwhich alone would have betrayed her to an intelligent observer that she\r\nentered the grove\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xithe meeting\r\n\r\n\r\nhad stephen been better acquainted with men and women she would have\r\nbeen more satisfied with herself for being the first at the tryst  the\r\nconventional idea in the minds of most women and of all men is that a\r\nwoman should never be the first  but real women those in whom the heart\r\nbeats strong and whose blood can leap know better  these are the\r\ncommanders of men  in them sex calls to sex all unconsciously at first\r\nand men answer to their call as they to mens\r\n\r\ntwo opposite feelings strove for dominance as stephen found herself on\r\nthe hilltop alone  one a feeling natural enough to any one and\r\nespecially to a girl of relief that a dreaded hour had been postponed\r\nthe other of chagrin that she was the first\r\n\r\nafter a few moments however one of the two militant thoughts became\r\ndominant the feeling of chagrin  with a pang she thought if she had\r\nbeen a man and summoned for such a purpose how she would have hurried to\r\nthe trystingplace how the flying of her feet would have vied with the\r\nquick rapturous beating of her heart  with a little sigh and a blush\r\nshe remembered that leonard did not know the purpose of the meeting that\r\nhe was a friend almost brought up with her since boy and girl times that\r\nhe had often been summoned in similar terms and for the most trivial of\r\nsocial purposes\r\n\r\nfor nearly half an hour stephen sat on the rustic seat under the shadow\r\nof the great oak looking half unconscious of its beauty and yet\r\ninfluenced by it over the wide landscape stretched at her feet\r\n\r\nin spite of her disregard of conventions she was no fool the instinct\r\nof wisdom was strong within her so strong that in many ways it ruled her\r\nconscious efforts  had any one told her that her preparations for this\r\ninterview were made deliberately with some of the astuteness that\r\ndominated the devil when he took jesus to the top of a high mountain and\r\nshowed him all the kingdoms of the earth at his feet she would have and\r\nwith truth denied it with indignation  nevertheless it was a fact that\r\nshe had in all unconsciousness chosen for the meeting a spot which\r\nwould evidence to a man consciously or unconsciously the desirability\r\nfor his own sake of acquiescence in her views and wishes  for all this\r\nspreading landscape was her possession which her husband would share  as\r\nfar as the eye could reach was within the estate which she had inherited\r\nfrom her father and her uncle\r\n\r\nthe halfhour passed in waiting had in one way its advantages to the\r\ngirl though she was still as high strung as ever she acquired a larger\r\nmeasure of control over herself  the nervous tension however was so\r\ncomplete physically that all her faculties were acutely awake very early\r\nshe became conscious of a distant footstep\r\n\r\nto stephens straining ears the footsteps seemed wondrous slow and more\r\nwondrous regular she felt instinctively that she would have liked to\r\nhave listened to a more hurried succession of less evenlymarked sounds\r\nbut notwithstanding these thoughts and the qualms which came in their\r\nturn the sound of the coming feet brought great joy  for after all\r\nthey were coming and coming just in time to prevent the sense of\r\ndisappointment at their delay gaining firm foothold  it was only when\r\nthe coming was assured that she felt how strong had been the undercurrent\r\nof her apprehension lest they should not come at all\r\n\r\nvery sweet and tender and beautiful stephen looked at this moment  the\r\nstrong lines of her face were softened by the dark fire in her eyes and\r\nthe feeling which glowed in the deep blushes which mantled her cheeks\r\nthe proudness of her bearing was no less marked than ever but in the\r\nwillowy sway of her body there was a yielding of mere sorry pride  in\r\nall the many moods which the gods allow to good women there is none so\r\ndear or so alluring consciously as well as instinctively to true men as\r\nthis selfsurrender  as leonard drew near stephen sank softly into a\r\nseat doing so with a guilty feeling of acting a part  when he actually\r\ncame into the grove he found her seemingly lost in a reverie as she gazed\r\nout over the wide expanse in front of her  he was hot after his walk\r\nand with something very like petulance threw himself into a cane\r\narmchair exclaiming as he did so with the easy insolence of old\r\nfamiliarity\r\n\r\nwhat a girl you are stephen dragging a fellow all the way up here\r\ncouldnt you have fixed it down below somewhere if you wanted to see me\r\n\r\nstrangely enough as it seemed to her stephen did not dislike his tone\r\nof mastery  there was something in it which satisfied her  the\r\nunconscious recognition of his manhood as opposed to her womanhood\r\nsoothed her in a peaceful way  it was easy to yield to a dominant man\r\nshe was never more womanly than when she answered him softly\r\n\r\nit was rather unfair but i thought you would not mind coming so far  it\r\nis so cool and delightful here and we can talk without being disturbed\r\nleonard was lying back in his chair fanning himself with his widebrimmed\r\nstraw hat with outstretched legs wide apart and resting on the back of\r\nhis heels  he replied with grudging condescension\r\n\r\nyes its cool enough after the hot tramp over the fields and through\r\nthe wood  its not so good as the house though in one way a man cant\r\nget a drink here  i say stephen it wouldnt be half bad if there were\r\na shanty put up here like those at the grands mulets or on the\r\nmatterhorn  there could be a tap laid on where a fellow could quench his\r\nthirst on a day like this\r\n\r\nbefore stephens eyes floated a momentary vision of a romantic chalet\r\nwith wide verandah and big windows looking over the landscape a great\r\nwide stone hearth quaint furniture made from the gnarled branches of\r\ntrees skins on the floor and the walls adorned with antlers great\r\nhorns and various trophies of the chase  and amongst them leonard in a\r\npicturesque suit lolling back just as at present and smiling with a\r\nloving look in his eyes as she handed him a great blueandwhite munich\r\nbeer mug topped with cool foam  there was a soft mystery in her voice as\r\nshe answered\r\n\r\nperhaps leonard there will some day be such a place here  he seemed\r\nto grumble as he replied\r\n\r\ni wish it was here now  some day seems a long way off\r\n\r\nthis seemed a good opening for stephen for the fear of the situation was\r\nagain beginning to assail her and she felt that if she did not enter on\r\nher task at once its difficulty might overwhelm her  she felt angry\r\nwith herself that there was a change in her voice as she said\r\n\r\nsome day may meancan mean everything  things neednt be a longer way\r\noff than we choose ourselves sometimes\r\n\r\ni say thats a good one  do you mean to say that because i am some day\r\nto own brindehow i can do as i like with it at once whilst the\r\ngovernors all there and a better life than i am any day  unless you\r\nwant me to shoot the old man by accident when we go out on the first  he\r\nlaughed a short unmeaning masculine laugh which jarred somewhat on her\r\nshe did not however mean to be diverted from her main purpose so she\r\nwent on quickly\r\n\r\nyou know quite well leonard that i dont mean anything of the kind\r\nbut there was something i wanted to say to you and i wished that we\r\nshould be alone  can you not guess what it is\r\n\r\nno ill be hanged if i can was his response lazily given\r\n\r\ndespite her resolution she turned her head she could not meet his eyes\r\nit cut her with a sharp pain to notice when she turned again that he was\r\nnot looking at her  he continued fanning himself with his hat as he\r\ngazed out at the view  she felt that the critical moment of her life had\r\ncome that it was now or never as to her fulfilling her settled\r\nintention  so with a rush she went on her way\r\n\r\nleonard you and i have been friends a long time  you know my views on\r\nsome points and that i think a woman should be as free to act as a man\r\nshe paused words and ideas did not seem to flow with the readiness she\r\nexpected  leonards arrogant assurance completed the dragging her back\r\nto earth which her own selfconsciousness began\r\n\r\ndrive on old girl  i know youre a crank from crankville on some\r\nsubjects  let us have it for all youre worth  im on the grass and\r\nlistening\r\n\r\nstephen paused  a crank from crankvillethis after her nights of\r\nsleepless anxiety after the making of the resolution which had cost her\r\nso much and which was now actually in process of realisation  was it\r\nall worth so much why not abandon it now    abandon it  abandon a\r\nresolution  all the obstinacy of her natureshe classed it herself as\r\nfirmnessrose in revolt  she shook her head angrily pulled herself\r\ntogether and went on\r\n\r\nthat may be though its not what i call myself or what i am usually\r\ncalled so far as i know  at any rate my convictions are honest and i\r\nam sure you will respect them as such even if you do not share them\r\nshe did not see the ready response in his face which she expected and so\r\nhurried on\r\n\r\nit has always seemed to me that awhen a woman has to speak to a man\r\nshe should do so as frankly as she would like him to speak to her and as\r\nfreely  leonard ii as she halted a sudden idea winged with\r\npossibilities of rescuing procrastination came to her  she went on more\r\neasily\r\n\r\ni know you are in trouble about money matters  why not let me help\r\nyou  he sat up and looked at her and said genially\r\n\r\nwell stephen you are a good old sort  no mistake about it  do you\r\nmean to say you would help me to pay my debts when the governor has\r\nrefused to do so any more\r\n\r\nit would be a great pleasure to me leonard to do anything for your\r\ngood or your pleasure\r\n\r\nthere was a long pause they both sat looking down at the ground  the\r\nwomans heart beat loud she feared that the man must hear it  she was\r\nconsumed with anxiety and with a desolating wish to be relieved from the\r\nstrain of saying more  surely surely leonard could not be so blind as\r\nnot to see the state of things    he would surely seize the occasion\r\nthrow aside his diffidence and relieve her    his words made a\r\nmomentary music in her ears as he spoke\r\n\r\nand is this what you asked me to come here for\r\n\r\nthe words filled her with a great shame  she felt herself a dilemma  it\r\nhad been no part of her purpose to allude his debts  viewed in the light\r\nof what was to follow it would seem to him that she was trying to\r\nforeclose his affection   that could not be allowed to pass the error\r\nmust be rectified  and yet    and yet this very error must be\r\ncleared up before she could make her full wish apparent  she seemed to\r\nfind herself compelled by inexorable circumstances into an unlookedfor\r\nbluntness  in any case she must face the situation  her pluck did not\r\nfail her it was with a very noble and graceful simplicity that she\r\nturned to her companion and said\r\n\r\nleonard i did not quite mean that  it would be a pleasure to me to be\r\nof that or any other service to you if i might be so happy  but i never\r\nmeant to allude to your debts   oh leonard cant you understand  if\r\nyou were my husbandoror going to be all such little troubles would\r\nfall away from you  but i would not for the world have you think    \r\n\r\nher very voice failed her  she could not speak what was in her mind she\r\nturned away hiding in her hands her face which fairly seemed to burn\r\nthis she thought was the time for a true lovers opportunity  oh if\r\nshe had been a man and a woman had so appealed how he would have sprung\r\nto her side and taken her in his arms and in a wild rapture of declared\r\naffection have swept away all the pain of her shame\r\n\r\nbut she remained alone  there was no springing to her side no rapture\r\nof declared affection no obliteration of her shame  she had to bear it\r\nall alone  there in the open under the eyes that she would fain have\r\nseen any other phase of her distress  her heart beat loud and fast she\r\nwaited to gain her selfcontrol\r\n\r\nleonard everard had his faults plenty of them and he was in truth\r\ncomposed of an amalgam of far baser metals than stephen thought but he\r\nhad been born of gentle blood and reared amongst gentlefolk  he did not\r\nquite understand the cause or the amount of his companions concern but\r\nhe could not but recognise her distress  he realised that it had\r\nfollowed hard upon her most generous intention towards himself  he could\r\nnot therefore do less than try to comfort her and he began his task in\r\na conventional way but with a blundering awkwardness which was all\r\nmanlike  he took her hand and held it in his this much at any rate he\r\nhad learned in sitting on stairs or in conservatories after extra dances\r\nhe said as tenderly as he could but with an impatient gesture unseen by\r\nher\r\n\r\nforgive me stephen  i suppose i have said or done something which i\r\nshouldnt  but i dont know what it is upon my honour i dont  anyhow\r\ni am truly sorry for it  cheer up old girl  im not your husband you\r\nknow so you neednt be distressed\r\n\r\nstephen took her courage a deux mains  if leonard would not speak she\r\nmust  it was manifestly impossible that the matter could be left in its\r\npresent state\r\n\r\nleonard she said softly and solemnly might not that some day be\r\n\r\nleonard in addition to being an egotist and the very incarnation of\r\nselfishness was a prig of the first water  he had been reared\r\naltogether in convention  home life and eton and christchurch had taught\r\nhim many things wise as well as foolish but had tended to fix his\r\nconviction that affairs of the heart should proceed on adamantine lines\r\nof conventional decorum  it never even occurred to him that a lady could\r\nso far step from the confines of convention as to take the initiative in\r\na matter of affection  in his blind ignorance he blundered brutally  he\r\nstruck better than he knew as meaning only to pass safely by an awkward\r\nconversational corner he replied\r\n\r\nno jolly fear of that  youre too much of a boss for me  the words\r\nand the levity with which they were spoken struck the girl as with a\r\nwhip  she turned for an instant as pale as ashes then the red blood\r\nrushed from her heart and face and neck were dyed crimson  it was not a\r\nblush it was a suffusion  in his ignorance leonard thought it was the\r\nformer and went on with what he considered his teasing\r\n\r\noh yes  you know you always want to engineer a chap your own way and\r\nmake him do just as you wish  the man who has the happiness of marrying\r\nyou stephen will have a hard row to hoe  his chaff with its utter\r\nwant of refinement seemed to her in her highstrung earnest condition\r\nnothing short of brutal and for a few seconds produced a feeling of\r\nrepellence  but it is in the nature of things that opposition of any\r\nkind arouses the fighting instinct of a naturally dominant nature  she\r\nlost sight of her femininity in the pursuit of her purpose and as this\r\nwas to win the man to her way of thinking she took the logical course of\r\nanswering his argument  if leonard everard had purposely set himself to\r\nstimulate her efforts in this direction he could hardly have chosen a\r\nbetter way  it came somewhat as a surprise to stephen when she heard\r\nher own words\r\n\r\ni would make a good wife leonard  a husband whom i loved and honoured\r\nwould i think not be unhappy  the sound of her own voice speaking\r\nthese words though the tone was low and tender and more selfsuppressing\r\nby far than was her wont seemed to peal like thunder in her own ears\r\nher last bolt seemed to have sped  the blood rushed to her head and she\r\nhad to hold on to the arms of the rustic chair or she would have fallen\r\nforward\r\n\r\nthe time seemed long before leonard spoke again every second seemed an\r\nage  she seemed to have grown tired of waiting for the sound of his\r\nvoice it was with a kind of surprise that she heard him say\r\n\r\nyou limit yourself wisely stephen\r\n\r\nhow do you mean she asked making a great effort to speak\r\n\r\nyou would promise to love and honour but there isnt anything about\r\nobeying\r\n\r\nas he spoke leonard stretched himself again luxuriously and laughed with\r\nthe intellectual arrogance of a man who is satisfied with a joke however\r\ninferior of his own manufacture  stephen looked at him with a long look\r\nwhich began in angerthat anger which comes from an unwonted sense of\r\nimpotence and ends in tolerance the intermediate step being admiration\r\nit is the primeval curse that a womans choice is to her husband and it\r\nis an important part of the teaching of a british gentlewoman knit in\r\nthe very fibres of her being by the remorseless etiquette of a thousand\r\nyears that she be true to him  the man who has in his person the\r\nnecessary powers or graces to evoke admiration in his wife even for a\r\npassing moment has a stronghold unconquerable as a rule by all the\r\ndeadliest arts of mankind\r\n\r\nleonard everard was certainly good to look upon as he lolled at his ease\r\non that summer morning  tall straight supple a typical british\r\ngentleman of the educated class with all parts of the body properly\r\ndeveloped and held in some kind of suitable poise\r\n\r\nas stephen looked the anxiety and chagrin which tormented her seemed to\r\npass  she realised that here was a nature different from her own and\r\nwhich should be dealt with in a way unsuitable to herself and the\r\nconviction seemed to make the action which it necessitated more easy as\r\nwell as more natural to her  perhaps for the first time in her life\r\nstephen understood that it may be necessary to apply to individuals a\r\nstandard of criticism unsuitable to selfjudgment  her recognition might\r\nhave been summed up in the thought which ran through her mind\r\n\r\none must be a little lenient with a man one loves\r\n\r\nstephen when once she had allowed the spirit of toleration to work\r\nwithin her felt immediately its calming influence  it was with brighter\r\nthoughts and better humour that she went on with her task  a task only\r\nit seemed now a means to an end which she desired\r\n\r\nleonard tell me seriously why do you think i gave you the trouble of\r\ncoming out here\r\n\r\nupon my soul stephen i dont know\r\n\r\nyou dont seem to care either lolling like that when i am serious  the\r\nwords were acid but the tone was soft and friendly familiar and\r\ngenuine putting quite a meaning of its own on them  leonard looked at\r\nher indolently\r\n\r\ni like to loll\r\n\r\nbut cant you even guess or try to guess what i ask you\r\n\r\ni cant guess  the days too hot and that shanty with the drinks is\r\nnot built yet\r\n\r\nor may never be  again he looked at her sleepily\r\n\r\nnever be  why not\r\n\r\nbecause leonard it may depend on you\r\n\r\nall right then  drive on  hurry up the architect and the\r\njerrybuilder\r\n\r\na quick blush leaped to stephens cheeks  the words were full of\r\nmeaning though the tone lacked something but the news was too good  she\r\ncould not accept it at once she decided to herself to wait a short time\r\nere many seconds had passed she rejoiced that she had done so as he went\r\non\r\n\r\ni hope youll give me a say before that husband of yours comes along  he\r\nmight be a blueribbonite and it wouldnt do to start such a shanty for\r\nrotgut\r\n\r\nagain a cold wave swept over her  the absolute difference of feeling\r\nbetween the man and herself his levity against her earnestness his\r\ncallous blindness to her purpose even the commonness of his words\r\nchilled her  for a few seconds she wavered again in her intention but\r\nonce again his comeliness and her own obstinacy joined hands and took her\r\nback to her path  with chagrin she felt that her words almost stuck in\r\nher throat as summoning up all her resolution she went on\r\n\r\nit would be for you i would have it built leonard  the man sat up\r\nquickly\r\n\r\nfor me he asked in a sort of wonderment\r\n\r\nyes leonard for you and me  she turned away her blushes so overcame\r\nher that she could not look at him  when she faced round again he was\r\nstanding up his back towards her\r\n\r\nshe stood up also  he was silent for a while so long that the silence\r\nbecame intolerable and she spoke\r\n\r\nleonard i am waiting  he turned round and said slowly the absence of\r\nall emotion from his face chilling her till her face blanched\r\n\r\ni dont think i would worry about it\r\n\r\nstephen norman was plucky and when she was face to face with any\r\ndifficulty she was all herself  leonard did not look pleasant his face\r\nwas hard and there was just a suspicion of anger  strangely enough this\r\nlast made the next step easier to the girl she said slowly\r\n\r\nall right  i think i understand\r\n\r\nhe turned from her and stood looking out on the distant prospect  then\r\nshe felt that the blow which she had all along secretly feared had fallen\r\non her  but her pride as well as her obstinacy now rebelled  she would\r\nnot accept a silent answer  there must be no doubt left to torture her\r\nafterwards  she would take care that there was no mistake  schooling\r\nherself to her task and pressing one hand for a moment to her side as\r\nthough to repress the beating of her heart she came behind him and\r\ntouched him tenderly on the arm\r\n\r\nleonard she said softly are you sure there is no mistake  do you\r\nnot see that i am asking you she intended to say to be my husband\r\nbut she could not utter the words they seemed to stick in her mouth so\r\nshe finished the sentence that i be your wife\r\n\r\nthe moment the words were spokenthe bare hard naked shameless\r\nwordsthe revulsion came  as a lightning flash shows up the blackness\r\nof the night the appalling truth of what she had done was forced upon\r\nher  the blood rushed to her head till cheeks and shoulders and neck\r\nseemed to burn  covering her face with her hands she sank back on the\r\nseat crying silently bitter tears that seemed to scald her eyes and her\r\ncheeks as they ran\r\n\r\nleonard was angry  when it began to dawn upon him what was the purpose\r\nof stephens speech he had been shocked  young men are so easily\r\nshocked by breaches of convention made by women they respect  and his\r\npride was hurt  why should he have been placed in such a ridiculous\r\nposition  he did not love stephen in that way and she should have known\r\nit  he liked her and all that sort of thing but what right had she to\r\nassume that he loved her  all the weakness of his moral nature came out\r\nin his petulance  it was boyish that his eyes filled with tears  he\r\nknew it and that made him more angry than ever  stephen might well have\r\nbeen at a loss to understand his anger as with manifest intention to\r\nwound he answered her\r\n\r\nwhat a girl you are stephen  you are always doing something or other\r\nto put a chap in the wrong and make him ridiculous  i thought you were\r\njokingnot a good joke either  upon my soul i dont know what ive\r\ndone that you should fix on me  i wish to goodness\r\n\r\nif stephen had suffered the red terror before she suffered the white\r\nterror now  it was not injured pride it was not humiliation it was not\r\nfear it was something vague and terrible that lay far deeper than any of\r\nthese  under ordinary circumstances she would have liked to have spoken\r\nout her mind and given back as good as she got and even as the thoughts\r\nwhirled through her brain they came in a torrent of vague vituperative\r\neloquence  but now her tongue was tied  instinctively she knew that she\r\nhad put it out of her power to revenge or even to defend herself  she\r\nwas tied to the stake and must suffer without effort and in silence\r\n\r\nmost humiliating of all was the thought that she must propitiate the man\r\nwho had so wounded her  all love for him had in the instant passed from\r\nher or rather she realised fully the blank bare truth that she had\r\nnever really loved him at all  had she really loved him even a blow at\r\nhis hands would have been acceptable but now   \r\n\r\nshe shook the feelings and thoughts from her as a bird does the water\r\nfrom its wings and with the courage and strength and adaptability of\r\nher nature addressed herself to the hard task which faced her in the\r\nimmediate present  with eloquent womanly gesture she arrested the\r\ntorrent of leonards indignation and as he paused in surprised\r\nobedience she said\r\n\r\nthat will do leonard  it is not necessary to say any more and i am\r\nsure you will see later on that at least there was no cause for your\r\nindignation  i have done an unconventional thing i know and i dare say\r\ni shall have to pay for it in humiliating bitterness of thought later on\r\nbut please remember we are all alone  this is a secret between us no\r\none else need ever know or suspect it\r\n\r\nshe rose as she concluded  the quiet dignity of her speech and bearing\r\nbrought back leonard in some way to his sense of duty as a gentleman  he\r\nbegan in a sheepish way to make an apology\r\n\r\nim sure i beg your pardon stephen  but again she held the warning\r\nhand\r\n\r\nthere is no need for pardon the fault if there were any was mine\r\nalone  it was i remember who asked you to come here and who introduced\r\nand conducted this melancholy business  i have asked you several things\r\nleonard and one more i will addtis only one that you will forget\r\n\r\nas she moved away her dismissal of the subject was that of an empress to\r\na serf  leonard would have liked to answer her to have given vent to\r\nhis indignation that even when he had refused her offer she should have\r\nthe power to treat him if he was the one refused and to make him feel\r\nsmall and ridiculous in his own eyes  but somehow he felt constrained to\r\nsilence her simple dignity outclassed him\r\n\r\nthere was another factor too in his forming his conclusion of silence\r\nhe had never seen stephen look so well or so attractive  he had never\r\nrespected her so much as when her playfulness had turned to majestic\r\ngravity  all the boy and girl strife of the years that had gone seemed\r\nto have passed away  the girl whom he had played with and bullied and\r\ntreated as frankly as though she had been a boy had in an instant become\r\na womanand such a woman as demanded respect and admiration even from\r\nsuch a man\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xiion the road home\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen leonard everard parted from stephen he did so with a feeling of\r\ndissatisfaction firstly with stephen secondly with things in general\r\nthirdly with himself  the first was definite concrete and immediate\r\nhe could give himself chapter and verse for all the girls misdoing\r\neverything she had said or done had touched some nerve painfully or had\r\noffended his feelings and to a man of his temperament his feelings are\r\nvery sacred things to himself\r\n\r\nwhy had she put him in such a ridiculous position  that was the worst\r\nof women  they were always wanting him to do something he didnt want to\r\ndo or crying    there was that girl at oxford\r\n\r\nhere he turned his head slowly and looked round in a furtive way which\r\nwas getting almost a habit with him  a fellow should go away so that he\r\nwouldnt have to swear lies  women were always wanting money or worse\r\nto be married  confound women they all seemed to want him to marry\r\nthem  there was the oxford girl and then the spaniard and now\r\nstephen  this put his thoughts in a new channel  he wanted money\r\nhimself  why stephen had spoken of it herself had offered to pay his\r\ndebts  gad it was a good idea that every one round the countryside\r\nseemed to know his affairs  what a flat he had been not to accept her\r\noffer then and there before matters had gone further  stephen had lots\r\nof money more than any girl could want  but she didnt give him time to\r\nget the thing fixed    if he had only known beforehand what she wanted\r\nhe could have come prepared    that was the way with women  always\r\nthinking of themselves  and now  of course she wouldnt stump up after\r\nhis refusing her  what would his father say if he came to hear of it\r\nand he must speak to him soon for these chaps were threatening to county\r\ncourt him if he didnt pay  those harpies in vere street were quite\r\nnasty      he wondered if he could work stephen for a loan\r\n\r\nhe walked on through the woodland path his pace slower than before  how\r\npretty she had looked  here he touched his little moustache  gad\r\nstephen was a fine girl anyhow  if it wasnt for all that red hair   \r\ni like em dark better    and her being such an infernal boss  \r\nthen he said unconsciously aloud\r\n\r\nif i was her husband id keep her to rights\r\n\r\npoor stephen\r\n\r\nso thats what the governor meant by telling me that fortune was to be\r\nhad and had easily if a man wasnt a blind fool  the governor is a\r\nstarchy old party  he wouldnt speak out straight and say heres\r\nstephen norman the richest girl you are ever likely to meet why dont\r\nyou make up to her and marry her  but that would be encouraging his son\r\nto be a fortunehunter  rot    and now just because she didnt tell\r\nme what she wanted to speak about or the governor didnt give me a hint\r\nso that i might be prepared i have gone and thrown away the chance\r\nafter all it mightnt be so bad  stephen is a fine girl    but she\r\nmustnt ever look at me as she did when i spoke about her not obeying  i\r\nmean to be master in my own house anyhow\r\n\r\na man mustnt be tied down too tight even if he is married  and if\r\ntheres plenty of loose cash about it isnt hard to cover up your tracks\r\n   i think id better think this thing over calmly and be ready when\r\nstephen comes at me again  thats the way with women  when a woman like\r\nstephen fixes her cold grey on a man she does not mean to go asleep over\r\nit  i daresay my best plan will be to sit tight and let her work\r\nherself up a bit  theres nothing like a little wholesome neglect for\r\nbringing a girl to her bearings   \r\n\r\nfor a while he walked on in satisfied selfcomplacency\r\n\r\nconfound her why couldnt she have let me know that she was fond of me\r\nin some decent way without all that formal theatrical proposing  its a\r\ndeuced annoying thing in the long run the way the women get fond of me\r\nthough its nice enough in some ways while it lasts he added as if in\r\nunwilling recognition of fact  as the path debouched on the highroad he\r\nsaid to himself half aloud\r\n\r\nwell shes a mighty fine girl anyhow  and if she is red ive had\r\nabout enough of the black    that spanish girl is beginning to kick\r\ntoo  i wish i had never come across    \r\n\r\nshut up you fool he said to himself as he walked on\r\n\r\nwhen he got home he found a letter from his father  he took it to his\r\nroom before breaking the seal  it was at least concise and to the point\r\n\r\n   the enclosed has been sent to me  you will have to deal with it\r\n   yourself  you know my opinion and also my intention   the items\r\n   which i have marked have been incurred since i spoke to you last about\r\n   your debts  i shall not pay another farthing for you  so take your\r\n   own course\r\n\r\n   jasper everard\r\n\r\nthe enclosed was a jewellers bill the length and the total of which\r\nlengthened his face and drew from him a low whistle   he held it in his\r\nhand for a long time standing quite still and silent  then drawing a\r\ndeep breath he said aloud\r\n\r\nthat settles it  the halter is on me  its no use squealing  if its\r\nto be a red head on my pillow    all right  i must only make the\r\nbest of it  anyhow ill have a good time today even if it must be the\r\nlast\r\n\r\nthat day harold was in norcester on business  it was late when he went\r\nto the club to dine  whilst waiting for dinner he met leonard everard\r\nflushed and somewhat at uncertain in his speech  it was something of a\r\nshock to harold to see him in such a state\r\n\r\nleonard was however an old friend and man is as a rule faithful to\r\nfriends in this form of distress  so in his kindly feeling harold\r\noffered to drive him home for he knew that he could thus keep him out of\r\nfurther harm  leonard thanked him in uncertain speech and said he would\r\nbe ready  in the meantime he would go and play billiards with the marker\r\nwhilst harold was having his dinner\r\n\r\nat ten oclock harolds dogcart was ready and he went to look for\r\nleonard who had not since come near him  he found him half asleep in\r\nthe smokingroom much drunker than he had been earlier in the evening\r\n\r\nthe drive was fairly long so harold made up his mind for a prolonged\r\nterm of uneasiness and anxiety  the cool nightair whose effect was\r\nincreased by the rapid motion soon increased leonards somnolence and\r\nfor a while he slept soundly his companion watching carefully lest he\r\nshould sway over and fall out of the trap  he even held him up as they\r\nswung round sharp corners\r\n\r\nafter a time he woke up and woke in a nasty temper  he began to find\r\nfault in an incoherent way with everything  harold said little just\r\nenough to prevent any cause for further grievance  then leonard changed\r\nand became affectionate  this mood was a greater bore than the other\r\nbut harold managed to bear it with stolid indifference  leonard was this\r\nby time making promises to do things for him that as he was what he\r\ncalled a goo fell he might count on his help and support in the\r\nfuture  as harold knew him to be a wastrel over head and ears in debt\r\nand with only the succession to a small estate he did not take much heed\r\nto his maunderings  at last the drunken man said something which\r\nstartled him so much that he instinctively drew himself together with\r\nsuch suddenness as to frighten the horse and almost make him rear up\r\nstraight\r\n\r\nwoa  woa  steady boy  gently he said quieting him  then turning\r\nto his companion said in a voice hollow with emotion and vibrant with\r\nsuppressed passion\r\n\r\nwhat was it you said\r\n\r\nleonard half awake and not half of that half master of himself\r\nanswered\r\n\r\ni said i will make you agent of normanstand when i marry stephen\r\n\r\nharold grew cold  to hear of any one marrying stephen was to him like\r\nplunging him in a glacier stream but to hear her name so lightly spoken\r\nand by such a man was a bewildering shock which within a second set his\r\nblood on fire\r\n\r\nwhat do you mean he thundered  you marry ste    miss norman\r\nyoure not worthy to untie her shoe  you indeed  she wouldnt look on\r\nthe same side of the street with a drunken brute like you  how dare you\r\nspeak of her in such a way\r\n\r\nbrute said leonard angrily his vanity reaching inward to heart and\r\nbrain through all the numbing obstacle of his drunken flesh  whos\r\nbrute  brute yourself  tell you goin to marry stephen cos stephen\r\nwants it  stephen loves me  loves me with all her red head  whare you\r\ndoin  wha\r\n\r\nhis words merged in a lessening gurgle for harold had now got him by the\r\nthroat\r\n\r\ntake care what you say about that lady damn you he said putting his\r\nface close the others with eyes that blazed  dont you dare to mention\r\nher name in such a way or you will regret it longer than you can think\r\nloves you you swine\r\n\r\nthe struggle and the fierce grip on his throat sobered leonard somewhat\r\nmomentarily sobbed him to that point when he could be coherent and\r\nvindictive though not to the point where he could think ahead  caution\r\nwisdom discretion taste were not for him at such a moment  guarding\r\nhis throat with both hands in an instinctive and spasmodic manner he\r\nanswered the challenge\r\n\r\nwho are you calling swine  i tell you she loves me  she ought to know\r\ndidnt she tell me so this very day  harold drew back his arm to strike\r\nhim in the face his anger too great for words  but the other seeing\r\nthe motion and in the sobering recognition of danger spoke hastily\r\n\r\nkeep your hair on  you know so jolly much more than i do  i tell you\r\nthat she told me this and a lot more this morning when she asked me to\r\nmarry her\r\n\r\nharolds heart grew cold as ice  there is something in the sound of a\r\nvoice speaking truthfully which a true man can recognise  through all\r\nleonards halfdrunken utterings came such a ring of truth and harold\r\nrecognised it  he felt that his voice was weak and hollow as he spoke\r\nthinking it necessary to give at first a sort of official denial to such\r\na monstrous statement\r\n\r\nliar\r\n\r\nim no liar answered leonard  he would like to have struck him in\r\nanswer to such a word had he felt equal to it  she asked me to marry\r\nher today on the hill above the house where i went to meet her by\r\nappointment  here  ill prove it to you  read this  whilst he was\r\nspeaking he had opened the greatcoat and was fumbling in the\r\nbreastpocket of his coat  he produced a letter which he handed to\r\nharold who took it with trembling hand  by this time the reins had\r\nfallen slack and the horse was walking quietly  there was moonlight but\r\nnot enough to read by  harold bent over and lifted the drivinglamp next\r\nto him and turned it so that he could read the envelope  he could hardly\r\nkeep either lamp or paper still his hand trembled so when he saw that\r\nthe direction was in stephens handwriting  he was handing it back when\r\nleonard said again\r\n\r\nopen it  read it  you must do so i tell you you must  you called me\r\na liar and now must read the proof that i am not  if you dont i shall\r\nhave to ask stephen to make you  before harolds mind flashed a rapid\r\nthought of what the girl might suffer in being asked to take part in such\r\na quarrel  he could not himself even act to the best advantage unless he\r\nknew the truth    he took the letter from the envelope and held it\r\nbefore the lamp the paper fluttering as though in a breeze from the\r\ntrembling of his hand  leonard looked on the dull glare of his eyes\r\nbrightening with malignant pleasure as he beheld the others concern  he\r\nowed him a grudge and by god he would pay it  had he not been\r\nstruckthrottledcalled a liar   \r\n\r\nas he read the words harolds face cleared  why you infernal young\r\nscoundrel he said angrily that letter is nothing but a simple note\r\nfrom a young girl to an old friendplaymate asking him to come to see\r\nher about some trivial thing  and you construe it into a proposal of\r\nmarriage  you hound  he held the letter whilst he spoke heedless of\r\nthe outstretched hand of the other waiting to take it back  there was a\r\ndangerous glitter in leonards eyes  he knew his man and he knew the\r\ntruth of what he had himself said and he felt with all the strength of\r\nhis base soul how best he could torture him  in the very strength of\r\nharolds anger in the poignancy of his concern in the relief to his\r\nsoul expressed in his eyes and his voice his antagonist realised the\r\njealousy of one who honoursand loves  second by second leonard grew\r\nmore sober and more and better able to carry his own idea into act\r\n\r\ngive me my letter he began\r\n\r\nwait said harold as he put the lamp back into its socket  that will\r\ndo presently  take back what you said just now\r\n\r\nwhat  take back what\r\n\r\nthat base lie that miss norman asked you to marry her\r\n\r\nleonard felt that in a physical struggle for the possession of the letter\r\nhe would be outmatched but his passion grew colder and more malignant\r\nand in a voice that cut like the hiss of a snake he spoke slowly and\r\ndeliberately  he was all sober now the drunkenness of brain and blood\r\nwas lost for the time in the strength of his cold passion\r\n\r\nit is true  by god it is true every word of it  that letter which\r\nyou want to steal is only a proof that i went to meet her on caester\r\nhill by her own appointment  when i got there she was waiting for me\r\nshe began to talk about a chalet there and at first i didnt know what\r\nshe meant\r\n\r\nthere was such conviction such a triumphant truth in his voice that\r\nharold was convinced\r\n\r\nstop he thundered stop dont tell me anything  i dont want to\r\nhear  i dont want to know  he covered his face with his hands and\r\ngroaned  it was not as though the speaker were a stranger in which case\r\nhe would have been by now well on in his death by strangulation he had\r\nknown leonard all his life and he was a friend of stephens  and he was\r\nspeaking truth\r\n\r\nthe baleful glitter of leonards eyes grew brighter still  he was as a\r\nserpent when he goes to strike  in this wise he struck\r\n\r\ni shall not stop  i shall go on and tell you all i choose  you have\r\ncalled me liartwice  you have also called me other names  now you\r\nshall hear the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  and if\r\nyou wont listen to me some one else will  harold groaned again\r\nleonards eyes brightened still more and the evil smile on his face grew\r\nbroader as he began more and more to feel his power  he went on to speak\r\nwith a cold deliberate malignancy but instinctively so sticking to\r\nabsolute truth that he could trust himself to hurt most  the other\r\nlistened cold at heart and physically his veins and arteries seemed\r\nstagnant\r\n\r\ni wont tell you anything of her pretty embarrassments how her voice\r\nfell as she pleaded how she blushed and stammered  why even i who am\r\nused to women and their pretty ways and their passions and their\r\nflushings and their stormy upbraidings didnt quite know for a while\r\nwhat she was driving at  so at last she spoke out pretty plainly and\r\ntold me what a fond wife shed make me if i would only take her  harold\r\nsaid nothing he only rocked a little as one in pain and his hands fell\r\nthe other went on\r\n\r\nthat is what happened this morning on caester hill under the trees where\r\ni met stephen norman by her own appointment honestly what happened  if\r\nyou dont believe me now you can ask stephen  my stephen he added in a\r\nfinal burst of venom as in a gleam of moonlight through a rift in the\r\nshadowy wood he saw the ghastly pallor of harolds face  then he added\r\nabruptly as he held out his hand\r\n\r\nnow give me my letter\r\n\r\nin the last few seconds harold had been thinking  and as he had been\r\nthinking for the good the safety of stephen his thoughts flew swift\r\nand true  this mans very tone the openness of his malignity the\r\nunderlying scorn when he spoke of her whom others worshipped showed him\r\nthe dangerthe terrible immediate danger in which she stood from such a\r\nman  with the instinct of a mind working as truly for the woman he loved\r\nas the needle does to the pole he spoke quietly throwing a sneer into\r\nthe tone so as to exasperate his companionit was brain against brain\r\nnow and for stephens sake\r\n\r\nand of course you accepted  you naturally would  the other fell into\r\nthe trap  he could not help giving an extra dig to his opponent by\r\nproving him once more in the wrong\r\n\r\noh no i didnt  stephen is a fine girl but she wants taking down a\r\nbit  shes too high and mighty just at present and wants to boss a chap\r\ntoo much  i mean to be master in my own house and shes got to begin as\r\nshe will have to go on  ill let her wait a bit and then ill yield by\r\ndegrees to her lovemaking  shes a fine girl for all her red head and\r\nshe wont be so bad after all\r\n\r\nharold listened chilled into still and silent amazement  to hear\r\nstephen spoken of in such a way appalled him  she of all women   \r\nleonard never knew how near sudden death he was as he lay back in his\r\nseat his eyes getting dull again and his chin sinking  the drunkenness\r\nwhich had been arrested by his passion was reasserting itself  harold\r\nsaw his state in time and arrested his own movement to take him by the\r\nthroat and dash him to the ground  even as he looked at him in scornful\r\nhate the cart gave a lurch and leonard fell forward  instinctively\r\nharold swept an arm round him and held him up  as he did so the\r\nunconsciousness of arrested sleep came leonards chin sank on his breast\r\nand he breathed stertorously\r\n\r\nas he drove on harolds thoughts circled in a tumult  vague ideas of\r\nextreme measures which he ought to take flashed up and paled away\r\nintention revolved upon itself till its weak side was exposed and it\r\nwas abandoned  he could not doubt the essential truth of leonards\r\nstatement regarding the proposal of marriage  he did not understand this\r\nnor did he try to  his own love for the girl and the bitter awaking to\r\nits futility made him so hopeless that in his own desolation all the\r\nmystery of her doing and the cause of it was merged and lost\r\n\r\nhis only aim and purpose now was her safety  one thing at least he could\r\ndo by fair means or foul stop leonards mouth so that others need not\r\nknow her shame  he groaned aloud as the thought came to him  beyond\r\nthis first step he could do nothing think of nothing as yet  and he\r\ncould not take this first step till leonard had so far sobered that he\r\ncould understand\r\n\r\nand so waiting for that time to come he drove on through the silent\r\nnight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xiiiharolds resolve\r\n\r\n\r\nas they went on their way harold noticed that leonards breathing became\r\nmore regular as in honest sleep  he therefore drove slowly so that the\r\nother might be sane again before they should arrive at the gate of his\r\nfathers place he had something of importance to say before they should\r\npart\r\n\r\nseeing him sleeping so peacefully harold passed a strap round him to\r\nprevent him falling from his seat  then he could let his thoughts run\r\nmore freely  her safety was his immediate concern again and again he\r\nthought over what he should say to leonard to ensure his silence\r\n\r\nwhilst he was pondering with set brows he was startled by leonards\r\nvoice at his side\r\n\r\nis that you harold  i must have been asleep  harold remained silent\r\namazed at the change  leonard went on quite awake and coherent\r\n\r\nby george  i must have been pretty well cut  i dont remember a thing\r\nafter coming down the stairs of the club and you and the hallporter\r\nhelping me up here  i say old chap you have strapped me up all safe\r\nand tight  it was good of you to take charge of me  i hope i havent\r\nbeen a beastly nuisance  harold answered grimly\r\n\r\nit wasnt exactly what i should have called it  then after looking\r\nkeenly at his companion he said are you quite awake and sober now\r\n\r\nquite  the answer came defiantly there was something in his\r\nquestioners tone which was militant and aggressive  before speaking\r\nfurther harold pulled up the horse  they were now crossing bare\r\nmoorland where anything within a mile could have easily been seen  they\r\nwere quite alone and would be undisturbed  then he turned to his\r\ncompanion\r\n\r\nyou talked a good deal in your drunken sleepif sleep it was  you\r\nappeared to be awake  leonard answered\r\n\r\ni dont remember anything of it  what did i say\r\n\r\ni am going to tell you  you said something so strange and so wrong that\r\nyou must answer for it  but first i must know its truth\r\n\r\nmust  you are pretty dictatorial said leonard angrily  must answer\r\nfor it  what do you mean\r\n\r\nwere you on caester hill today\r\n\r\nwhats that to you  there was no mistaking the defiant quarrelsome\r\nintent\r\n\r\nanswer me were you  harolds voice was strong and calm\r\n\r\nwhat if i was  it is none of your affair  did i say anything in what\r\nyou have politely called my drunken sleep\r\n\r\nyou did\r\n\r\nwhat did i say\r\n\r\ni shall tell you in time  but i must know the truth as i proceed  there\r\nis some one else concerned in this and i must know as i go on  you can\r\neasily judge by what i say if i am right\r\n\r\nthen ask away and be damned to you  harolds calm voice seemed to\r\nquell the others turbulence as he went on\r\n\r\nwere you on caester hill this morning\r\n\r\ni was\r\n\r\ndid you meet miss  a lady there\r\n\r\nwhat    i did\r\n\r\nwas it by appointment  some sort of idea or halfrecollection seemed\r\nto come to leonard he fumbled half consciously in his breastpocket\r\nthen he broke out angrily\r\n\r\nyou have taken my letter\r\n\r\ni know the answer to that question said harold slowly  you showed me\r\nthe letter yourself and insisted on my reading it  leonards heart\r\nbegan to quail  he seemed to have an instinctive dread of what was\r\ncoming  harold went on calmly and remorselessly\r\n\r\ndid a proposal of marriage pass between you\r\n\r\nyes  the answer was defiantly given leonard began to feel that his\r\nback was against the wall\r\n\r\nwho made it  the answer was a sudden attempt at a blow but harold\r\nstruck down his hand in time and held it  leonard though a fairly\r\nstrong man was powerless in that iron grasp\r\n\r\nyou must answer  it is necessary that i know the truth\r\n\r\nwhy must you  what have you to do with it  you are not my keeper  nor\r\nstephens though i dare say you would like to be  the insult cooled\r\nharolds rising passion even whilst it wrung his heart\r\n\r\ni have to do with it because i choose  you may find the answer if you\r\nwish in your last insult  now clearly understand me leonard everard\r\nyou know me of old and you know that what i say i shall do  one way or\r\nanother your life or mine may hang on your answers to meif necessary\r\nleonard felt himself pulled up  he knew well the strength and purpose of\r\nthe man  with a light laugh which he felt to be as it was hollow he\r\nanswered\r\n\r\nwell schoolmaster as you are asking questions i suppose i may as well\r\nanswer them  go on  next  harold went on in the same calm cold\r\nvoice\r\n\r\nwho made the proposal of marriage\r\n\r\nshe did\r\n\r\ndid    was it made at once and directly or after some preliminary\r\nsuggestion\r\n\r\nafter a bit  i didnt quite understand at first what she was driving\r\nat  there was a long pause  with an effort harold went on\r\n\r\ndid you accept  leonard hesitated  with a really wicked scowl he eyed\r\nhis big powerfullybuilt companion who still had his hand as in a vice\r\nthen seeing no resource he answered\r\n\r\ni did not  that does not mean that i wont though he added\r\ndefiantly  to his surprise harold suddenly released his hand  there was\r\na grimness in his tone as he said\r\n\r\nthat will do  i know now that you have spoken the truth sober as well\r\nas drunk  you need say no more  i know the rest  most meneven brutes\r\nlike you if there are anywould have been ashamed even to think the\r\nthings you said said openly to me you hound  you vile traitorous\r\nmeansouled hound\r\n\r\nwhat did i say\r\n\r\ni know what you said and i shall not forget it  he went on his voice\r\ndeepening into a stern judicial utterance as though he were pronouncing\r\na sentence of death\r\n\r\nleonard everard you have treated vilely a lady whom i love and honour\r\nmore than i love my own soul  you have insulted her to her face and\r\nbehind her back  you have made such disloyal reference to her and to her\r\nmad act in so trusting you and have so shown your intention of causing\r\nintentionally or unintentionally woe to her that i tell you here and\r\nnow that you hold henceforth your life in your hand  if you ever mention\r\nto a living soul what you have told me twice tonight even though you\r\nshould be then her husband if you should cause her harm though she\r\nshould then be your wife if you should cause her dishonour in public or\r\nin private i shall kill you  so help me god\r\n\r\nnot a word more did he say but taking up the reins drove on in silence\r\ntill they arrived at the gate of brindehow where he signed to him to\r\nalight\r\n\r\nhe drove off in silence\r\n\r\nwhen he arrived at his own house he sent the servant to bed and then\r\nwent to his study where he locked himself in  then and then only did\r\nhe permit his thoughts to have full range  for the first time since the\r\nblow had fallen he looked straight in the face the change in his own\r\nlife  he had loved stephen so long and so honestly that it seemed to him\r\nnow as if that love had been the very foundation of his life  he could\r\nnot remember a time when he had not loved her away back to the time when\r\nhe a big boy took her a little girl under his care and devoted\r\nhimself to her  he had grown into the belief that so strong and so\r\nconsistent an affection though he had never spoken it or even hinted at\r\nit or inferred it had become a part of her life as well as of his own\r\nand this was the end of that dreaming  not only did she not care for\r\nhim but found herself with a heart so empty that she needs must propose\r\nmarriage to another man  there was surely something more than at\r\npresent he knew of or could understand behind such an act done by her\r\nwhy should she ask everard to marry her  why should she ask any man\r\nwomen didnt do such things    here he paused  women didnt do such\r\nthings  all at once there came back to him fragments of discussionsin\r\nwhich stephen had had a part in which matters of convention had been\r\ndealt with  out of these dim and shattered memories came a comfort to\r\nhis heart though his brain could not as yet grasp the reason of it  he\r\nknew that stephen had held an unconventional idea as to the equality of\r\nthe sexes  was it possible that she was indeed testing one of her\r\ntheories\r\n\r\nthe idea stirred him so that he could not remain quiet  he stood up and\r\nwalked the room  somehow he felt light beginning to dawn though he\r\ncould not tell its source or guess at the final measure of its fulness\r\nthe fact of stephen having done such a thing was hard to bear but it was\r\nharder to think that she should have done such a thing without a motive\r\nor worse with love of leonard as a motive  he shuddered as he paused\r\nshe could not love such a man  it was monstrous  and yet she had done\r\nthis thing    oh if she had had any one to advise her to restrain\r\nher  but she had no mother  no mother  poor stephen\r\n\r\nthe pity of it not for himself but for the woman he loved overcame him\r\nsitting down heavily before his desk he put his face on his hands and\r\nhis great shoulders shook\r\n\r\nlong long after the violence of his emotion had passed he sat there\r\nmotionless thinking with all the power and sincerity he knew thinking\r\nfor stephens good\r\n\r\nwhen a strong man thinks unselfishly some good may come out of it  he\r\nmay blunder but the conclusion of his reasoning must be in the main\r\nright  so it was with harold  he knew that he was ignorant of women\r\nand of womans nature as distinguished from mans  the only woman he\r\nhad ever known well was stephen and she in her youth and in her\r\nignorance of the world and herself was hardly sufficient to supply to him\r\ndata for his present needs  to a cleanminded man of his age a woman is\r\nsomething divine  it is only when in later life disappointment and\r\nexperience have hammered bitter truth into his brain that he begins to\r\nrealise that woman is not angelic but human  when he knows more and\r\nfinds that she is like himself human and limited but with qualities of\r\npurity and sincerity and endurance which put his own to shame he\r\nrealises how much better a helpmate she is for man than could be the\r\nvague unreal creations of his dreams  and then he can thank god for his\r\ngoodness that when he might have given us angels he did give us women\r\n\r\nof one thing despite the seeming of facts he was sure stephen did not\r\nlove leonard  every fibre of his being revolted at the thought  she of\r\nso high a nature he of so low  she so noble he so mean  bah the\r\nbelief was impossible\r\n\r\nimpossible  herein was the manifestation of his ignorance anything is\r\npossible where love is concerned  it was characteristic of the man that\r\nin his mind he had abandoned for the present at all events his own\r\npain  he still loved stephen with all the strength of his nature but\r\nfor him the selfish side ceased to exist  he was trying to serve\r\nstephen and every other thought had to give way  he had been satisfied\r\nthat in a manner she loved him in some way and in some degree and he had\r\nhoped that in the fulness of time the childish love would ripen so that\r\nin the end would come a mutual affection which was of the very essence of\r\nheaven  he believed still that she loved him in some way but the future\r\nthat was based on hope had now been wiped out with a sudden and unsparing\r\nhand  she had actually proposed marriage to another man  if the idea of\r\na marriage with him had ever crossed her mind she could have had no doubt\r\nof her feeling toward another    and yet  and yet he could not\r\nbelieve that she loved leonard not even if all trains of reasoning\r\nshould end by leading to that point  one thing he had at present to\r\naccept that whatever might be the measure of affection stephen might\r\nhave for him it was not love as he understood it  he resolutely turned\r\nhis back on the thought of his own side of the matter and tried to find\r\nsome justification of stephens act\r\n\r\nseek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened to ye has perhaps\r\na general as well as a special significance  it is by patient tireless\r\nseeking that many a precious thing has been found  it was after many a\r\nlong cycle of thought that the seeking and the knocking had effectual\r\nresult  harold came to believe vaguely at first but more definitely as\r\nthe evidence nucleated that stephens act was due to some mad girlish\r\nwish to test her own theory to prove to herself the correctness of her\r\nown reasoning the fixity of her own purpose  he did not go on analysing\r\nfurther for as he walked the room with a portion of the weight taken\r\nfrom his heart he noticed that the sky was beginning to quicken  the day\r\nwould soon be upon him and there was work to be done  instinctively he\r\nknew that there was trouble in store for stephen and he felt that in\r\nsuch an hour he should be near her  all her life she had been accustomed\r\nto him  in her sorrows to confide in him to tell him her troubles so\r\nthat they might dwindle and pass away to enhance her pleasures by making\r\nhim a sharer in them\r\n\r\nharold was inspirited by the coming of the new day  there was work to be\r\ndone and the work must be based on thought  his thoughts must take a\r\npractical turn what was he to do that would help stephen  here there\r\ndawned on him for the first time the understanding of a certain\r\nhumiliation which she had suffered she had been refused  she who had\r\nstepped so far out of the path of maidenly reserve in which she had\r\nalways walked as to propose marriage to a man had been refused  he did\r\nnot could not know to the full the measure of such humiliation to a\r\nwoman but he could guess at any rate a part  and that guessing made him\r\ngrind his teeth in impotent rage\r\n\r\nbut out of that rage came an inspiration  if stephen had been humiliated\r\nby the refusal of one man might not this be minimised if she in turn\r\nmight refuse another  harold knew so well the sincerity of his own love\r\nand the depth of his own devotion that he was satisfied that he could not\r\nerr in giving the girl the opportunity of refusing him  it would be some\r\nsort of balm to her wounded spirit to know that leonards views were not\r\nshared by all men  that there were others who would deem it a joy to\r\nserve as her slaves  when she had refused him she would perhaps feel\r\neasier in her mind  of course if she did not refuse him    ah well\r\nthen would the gates of heaven open    but that would never be  the\r\npast could not be blotted out  all he could do would be to serve her  he\r\nwould go early  such a man as leonard everard might make some new\r\ncomplication and the present was quite bad enough\r\n\r\nit was a poor enough thing for him he thought at length  she might\r\ntrample on him but it was for her sake  and to him what did it matter\r\nthe worst had come  all was over now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xivthe beech grove\r\n\r\n\r\non the morning following the proposal stephen strolled out into a beech\r\ngrove some little distance from the house which from childhood had been\r\na favourite haunt of hers  it was not in the immediate road to anywhere\r\nand so there was no occasion for any of the household or the garden to go\r\nthrough it or near it  she did not put on a hat but took only a\r\nsunshade which she used in passing over the lawn  the grove was on the\r\nside of the house away from her own room and the breakfastroom  when\r\nshe had reached its shade she felt that at last she was alone\r\n\r\nthe grove was a privileged place  long ago a great number of young\r\nbeeches had been planted so thickly that as they grew they shot up\r\nstraight and branchless in their struggle for the light  not till they\r\nhad reached a considerable altitude had they been thinned and then the\r\nthinning had been so effected that as the high branches began to shoot\r\nout in the freer space they met in time and interlaced so closely that\r\nthey made in many places a perfect screen of leafy shade  here and there\r\nwere rifts or openings through which the light passed under such places\r\nthe grass was fine and green or the wild hyacinths in due season tinged\r\nthe earth with blue  through the grove some wide alleys had been left\r\ngreat broad walks where the soft grass grew short and fine and to whose\r\nedges came a drooping of branches and an upspringing of undergrowth of\r\nlaurel and rhododendron  at the far ends of these walks were little\r\npavilions of marble built in the classic style which ruled for garden use\r\ntwo hundred years ago  at the near ends some of them were close to the\r\nbroad stretch of water from whose edges ran back the great sloping banks\r\nof emerald sward dotted here and there with great forest trees  the\r\ngrove was protected by a haha so that it was never invaded from\r\nwithout and the servants of the house both the domestics and the\r\ngardeners and grooms had been always forbidden to enter it  thus by\r\nlong usage it had become a place of quiet and solitude for the members of\r\nthe family\r\n\r\nto this soothing spot had come stephen in her pain  the long spell of\r\nselfrestraint during that morning had almost driven her to frenzy and\r\nshe sought solitude as an anodyne to her tortured soul  the long anguish\r\nof a third sleepless night following on a day of humiliation and terror\r\nhad destroyed for a time the natural resilience of a healthy nature  she\r\nhad been for so long in the prison of her own purpose with fear as\r\nwarder the fetters of conventional life had so galled her that here in\r\nthe accustomed solitude of this place in which from childhood she had\r\nbeen used to move and think freely she felt as does a captive who has\r\nescaped from an irksome durance  as stephen had all along been free of\r\nmovement and speech no such opportunities of freedom called to her  the\r\npentup passion in her however found its own relief  her voice was\r\nsilent and she moved with slow steps halting often between the green\r\ntreetrunks in the cool shade but her thoughts ran free and passion\r\nfound a vent  no stranger seeing the tall queenly girl moving slowly\r\nthrough the trees could have imagined the fierce passion which blazed\r\nwithin her unless he had been close enough to see her eyes  the habit\r\nof physical restraint to which all her life she had been accustomed and\r\nwhich was intensified by the experience of the past thirtysix hours\r\nstill ruled her even here  gradually the habit of security began to\r\nprevail and the shackles to melt away  here had she come in all her\r\nchildish troubles  here had she fought with herself and conquered\r\nherself  here the spirits of the place were with her and not against\r\nher  here memory in its second degree habit gave her the full sense of\r\nspiritual freedom\r\n\r\nas she walked to and fro the raging of her spirit changed its objective\r\nfrom restraint to its final causes and chief amongst them the pride\r\nwhich had been so grievously hurt  how she loathed the day that had\r\npassed and how more than all she hated herself for her part in it her\r\nmad foolish idiotic selfimportance which gave her the idea of such an\r\nact and urged her to the bitter end of its carrying out her mulish\r\nobstinacy in persisting when every fibre of her being had revolted at the\r\ndoing and when deep in her inmost soul was a deterring sense of its\r\nfutility  how could she have stooped to have done such a thing to ask a\r\nman    oh the shame of it the shame of it all  how could she have\r\nbeen so blind as to think that such a man was worthy   \r\n\r\nin the midst of her whirlwind of passion came a solitary gleam of relief\r\nshe knew with certainty that she did not love leonard that she had never\r\nloved him  the coldness of disdain to him the fear of his future acts\r\nwhich was based on disbelief of the existence of that finer nature with\r\nwhich she had credited him all proved to her convincingly that he could\r\nnever really have been within the charmed circle of her inner life  did\r\nshe but know it there was an even stronger evidence of her indifference\r\nto him in the ready manner in which her thoughts flew past him in their\r\ncircling sweep  for a moment she saw him as the centre of a host of\r\nbesetting fears but her own sense of superior power nullified the force\r\nof the vision  she was able to cope with him and his doings were there\r\nsuch need  and so her mind flew back to the personal side of her\r\ntrouble her blindness her folly her shame\r\n\r\nin truth she was doing good work for herself  her mind was working truly\r\nand to a beneficent end  one by one she was overcoming the false issues\r\nof her passion and drifting to an end in which she would see herself face\r\nto face and would place so truly the blame for what had been as to make\r\nit a warning and ennobling lesson of her life  she moved more quickly\r\npassing to and fro as does a panther in its cage when the desire of\r\nforest freedom is heavy upon it\r\n\r\nthat which makes the irony of life will perhaps never be understood in\r\nits casual aspect by the finite mind of man  the why and wherefore\r\nand the how of it is only to be understood by that allwise\r\nintelligence which can scan the future as well as the present and see\r\nthe far farreaching ramifications of those schemes of final development\r\nto which the manifestation of completed character tend\r\n\r\nto any mortal it would seem a pity that to stephen in her solitude when\r\nher passion was working itself out to an end which might be good should\r\ncome an interruption which would throw it back upon itself in such a way\r\nas to multiply its malignant force  but again it is a part of the great\r\nplan that instruments whose use mans finite mind could never predicate\r\nshould be employed the seeming good to evil the seeming evil to good\r\n\r\nas she swept to and fro her raging spirit compelling to violent\r\nmovement stephens eyes were arrested by the figure of a man coming\r\nthrough the aisles of the grove  at such a time any interruption of her\r\npassion was a cause for heightening anger but the presence of a person\r\nwas as a draught to a fullfed furnace  most of all in her present\r\ncondition of mind the presence of a manfor the thought of a man lay\r\nbehind all her trouble was as a tornado striking a burning forest  the\r\nblood of her tortured heart seemed to leap to her brain and to suffuse\r\nher eyes  she saw blood\r\n\r\nit mattered not that the man whom she saw she knew and trusted  indeed\r\nthis but added fuel to the flame  in the presence of a stranger some of\r\nher habitual selfrestraint would doubtless have come back to her  but\r\nnow the necessity for such was foregone harold was her alter ego and in\r\nhis presence was safety  he was in this aspect but a higher and more\r\nintelligent rendering of the trees around her  in another aspect he was\r\nan opportune victim something to strike at  when the anger of a poison\r\nsnake opens its gland and the fang is charged with venom it must strike\r\nat something  it does not pause or consider what it may be it strikes\r\nthough it may be at stone or iron  so stephen waited till her victim was\r\nwithin distance to strike  her black eyes fierce with passion and blood\r\nrimmed as a cobras glittered as he passed among the treetrunks towards\r\nher eager with his errand of devotion\r\n\r\nharold was a man of strong purpose  had he not been he would never have\r\ncome on his present errand  never perhaps had any suitor set forth on\r\nhis quest with a heavier heart  all his life since his very boyhood\r\nhad been centred round the girl whom today he had come to serve  all\r\nhis thought had been for her and today all he could expect was a gentle\r\ndenial of all his hopes so that his future life would be at best a\r\nblank\r\n\r\nbut he would be serving stephen  his pain might be to her good ought to\r\nbe to a certain extent to her mental ease  her wounded pride would\r\nfind some solace    as he came closer the feeling that he had to play\r\na part veritably to act one came stronger and stronger upon him and\r\nfilled him with bitter doubt as to his power  still he went on boldly\r\nit had been a part of his plan to seem to come eagerly as a lover should\r\ncome and so he came  when he got close to stephen all the witchery of\r\nher presence came upon him as of old  after all he loved her with his\r\nwhole soul and the chance had come to tell her so  even under the\r\ndistressing conditions of his suit the effort had its charm\r\n\r\nstephen schooled herself to her usual attitude with him and that too\r\nsince the effort was based on truth came with a certain ease to her  at\r\nthe present time in her present frame of mind nothing in the wide world\r\ncould give her pleasure the ease which came if it did not change her\r\npurpose increased her power  their usual salutation begun when she was\r\na little baby was good morning stephen  good morning harold  it\r\nhad become so much a custom that now it came mechanically on her part\r\nthe tender reference to childhoods days though it touched her companion\r\nto the quick did not appeal to her since she had no special thought of\r\nit  had such a thought come to her it might have softened her even to\r\ntears for harold had been always deep in her heart  as might have been\r\nexpected from her character and condition of mind she was the first to\r\nbegin\r\n\r\ni suppose you want to see me about something special harold you have\r\ncome so early\r\n\r\nyes stephen  very special\r\n\r\nwere you at the house she asked in a voice whose quietness might have\r\nconveyed a warning  she was so suspicious now that she suspected even\r\nharold ofof what she did not know  he answered in all simplicity\r\n\r\nno  i came straight here\r\n\r\nhow did you know i should be here  her voice was now not only quiet\r\nbut sweet  without thinking harold blundered on  his intention was so\r\nsingleminded and his ignorance of woman so complete that he did not\r\nrecognise even elementary truths\r\n\r\ni knew you always came here long ago when you were a child when you were\r\nin  here it suddenly flashed upon him that if he seemed to expect that\r\nshe was in trouble as he had purposed saying he would give away his\r\nknowledge of what had happened and so destroy the work to which he had\r\nset himself  so he finished the sentence in a lame and impotent manner\r\nwhich however saved complete annihilation as it was verbally accurate\r\nin short frocks  stephen needed to know little more  her quick\r\nintelligence grasped the fact that there was some purpose afoot which she\r\ndid not know or understand  she surmised of course that it was some\r\nway in connection with her mad act and she grew cooler in her brain as\r\nwell as colder in her heart as she prepared to learn more  stephen had\r\nchanged from girl to woman in the last twentyfour hours and all the\r\nwoman in her was now awake  after a moments pause she said with a\r\nwinning smile\r\n\r\nwhy harold ive been in long frocks for years  why should i come here\r\non this special day on that account  even as she was speaking she felt\r\nthat it would be well to abandon this ground of inquiry  it had clearly\r\ntold her all it could  she would learn more by some other means  so she\r\nwent on in a playful way as a catnot a kittendoes when it has got a\r\nmouse\r\n\r\nthat reason wont work harold  its quite rusty in the joints  but\r\nnever mind it  tell me why you have come so early  this seemed to\r\nharold to be a heavensent opening he rushed in at once\r\n\r\nbecause stephen i wanted to ask you to be my wife  oh stephen dont\r\nyou know that i love you  ever since you were a little girl  when you\r\nwere a little girl and i a big boy i loved you  i have loved you ever\r\nsince with all my heart and soul and strength  without you the world\r\nis a blank to me  for you and your happiness i would do\r\nanythinganything\r\n\r\nthis was no acting  when once the barrier of beginning had been broken\r\nhis soul seemed to pour itself out  the man was vibrant through all his\r\nnature and the womans very soul realised its truth  for an instant a\r\nflame of gladness swept through her and for the time it lasted put all\r\nother thought aside\r\n\r\nbut suspicion is a hard metal which does not easily yield to fire  it\r\ncan come to white heat easily enough but its meltingpoint is high\r\nindeed  when the flame had leaped it had spent its force the reaction\r\ncame quick  stephens heart seemed to turn to ice all the heat and life\r\nrushing to her brain  her thoughts flashed with convincing quickness\r\nthere was no time for doubting amid their rush  her life was for good or\r\nill at the crossing of the ways  she had trusted harold thoroughly  the\r\nhabit of her whole life from her babyhood up had been to so look to him\r\nas comrade and protector and sympathetic friend  she was so absolutely\r\nsure of his earnest devotion that this new experience of a riper feeling\r\nwould have been a joy to her if it should be that his act was all\r\nspontaneous and done in ignorance of her shame  shame was the generic\r\nword which now summarised to herself her thought of her conduct in\r\nproposing to leonard  but of this she must be certain  she could not\r\ndare not go farther till this was settled  with the same craving for\r\ncertainty with which she convinced herself that leonard understood her\r\novertures and with the same dogged courage with which she pressed the\r\nmatter on him she now went on to satisfy her mind\r\n\r\nwhat did you do yesterday\r\n\r\ni was at norcester all day  i went early  by the way here is the\r\nribbon you wanted i think its exactly the same as the pattern  as he\r\nspoke he took a tissuepiper parcel from his pocket and handed it to her\r\n\r\nthanks she said  did you meet any friends there\r\n\r\nnot many  he answered guardedly he had a secret to keep\r\n\r\nwhere did you dine\r\n\r\nat the club  he began to be uneasy at this questioning but he did not\r\nsee any way to avoid answering without creating some suspicion\r\n\r\ndid you see any one you knew at the club  her voice as she spoke was a\r\nlittle harder a little more strained  harold noticed the change rather\r\nby instinct than reason  he felt that there was danger in it and\r\npaused  the pause seemed to suddenly create a new fury in the breast of\r\nstephen  she felt that harold was playing with her  harold  if she\r\ncould not trust him where then was she to look for trust in the world\r\nif he was not frank with her what then meant his early coming his\r\nseeking her in the grove his proposal of marriage which seemed so\r\nsudden and so inopportune  he must have seen leonard and by some means\r\nhave become acquainted with her secret of shame    his motive\r\n\r\nhere her mind halted  she knew as well as if it had been trumpeted from\r\nthe skies that harold knew all  but she must be certain    certain\r\n\r\nshe was standing erect her hands held down by her sides and clenched\r\ntogether till the knuckles were white all her body strung highlike an\r\noverpitched violin  now she raised her right hand and flung it downward\r\nwith a passionate jerk\r\n\r\nanswer me she cried imperiously  answer me  why are you playing\r\nwith me  did you see leonard everard last night  answer me i say\r\nharold an wolf you do not lie  answer me\r\n\r\nas she spoke harold grew cold  from the question he now knew that\r\nstephen had guessed his secret  the fat was in the fire with a\r\nvengeance  he did not know what to do and still remained silent  she\r\ndid not give him time to think but spoke again this time more coldly\r\nthe white terror had replaced the red\r\n\r\nare you not going to answer me a simple question harold  to be silent\r\nnow is to wrong me  i have a right to know\r\n\r\nin his trouble for he felt that say what he would he could only give her\r\nnew pain he said humbly\r\n\r\ndont ask me stephen  wont you understand that i want to do what is\r\nbest for you  wont you trust me  her answer came harshly  a more\r\nexperienced man than harold one who knew women better would have seen\r\nhow overwrought she was and would have made pity the pivot of his future\r\nbearing and acts and words while the interview lasted pity and pity\r\nonly  but to harold the high ideal was ever the same  the stephen whom\r\nhe loved was no subject for pity but for devotion only  he knew the\r\nnobility of her nature and must trust it to the end  when her silence\r\nand her blazing eyes denied his request he answered her query in a low\r\nvoice\r\n\r\ni did  even whilst he spoke he was thankful for one thing he had not\r\nbeen pledged in any way to confidence  leonard had forced the knowledge\r\non him and though he would have preferred a million times over to be\r\nsilent he was still free to speak  stephens next question came more\r\ncoldly still\r\n\r\ndid he tell you of his meeting with me\r\n\r\nhe did\r\n\r\ndid he tell you all  it was torture to him to answer but he was at\r\nthe stake and must bear it\r\n\r\ni think so  if it was true\r\n\r\nwhat did he tell you  stay  i shall ask you the facts myself the\r\nbroad facts  we need not go into details    \r\n\r\noh stephen  she silenced his pleading with an imperious hand\r\n\r\nif i can go into this matter surely you can  if i can bear the shame\r\nof telling you can at least bear that of listening  remember that\r\nknowingknowing what you know or at least what you have heardyou\r\ncould come here and propose marriage to me  this she said with a cold\r\ncutting sarcasm which sounded like the rasping of a roughlysharpened\r\nknife through raw flesh  harold groaned in spirit he felt a weakness\r\nwhich began at his heart to steal through him  it took all his manhood\r\nto bear himself erect  he dreaded what was coming as of old the once\r\ntortured victim dreaded the coming torment of the rack\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xvthe end of the meeting\r\n\r\n\r\nstephen went on in her calm cold voice\r\n\r\ndid he tell you that i had asked him to marry me  despite herself as\r\nshe spoke the words a red tide dyed her face  it was not a flush it was\r\nnot a blush it was a sort of flood which swept through her leaving her\r\nin a few seconds whiter than before  harold saw and understood  he\r\ncould not speak he lowered his head silently  her eyes glittered more\r\ncoldly  the madness that every human being may have once was upon her\r\nsuch a madness is destructive and here was something more vulnerable\r\nthan herself\r\n\r\ndid he tell you how i pressed him  there was no red tide this time\r\nnor ever again whilst the interview lasted  to bow in affirmation was\r\ninsufficient with an effort he answered\r\n\r\ni understood so  she answered with an icy sarcasm\r\n\r\nyou understood so  oh i dont doubt he embellished the record with\r\nsome of his own pleasantries  but you understood it and that is\r\nsufficient  after a pause she went on\r\n\r\ndid he tell you that he had refused me\r\n\r\nyes  harold knew now that he was under the torture and that there was\r\nno refusing  she went on with a light laugh which wrung his heart even\r\nmore than her pain had done    stephen to laugh like that\r\n\r\nand i have no doubt that he embellished that too with some of his fine\r\nmasculine witticisms  i understood myself that he was offended at my\r\nasking him  i understood it quite well he told me so  then with\r\nfeminine intuition she went on\r\n\r\ni dare say that before he was done he said something kindly of the poor\r\nlittle thing that loved him that loved him so much and that she had to\r\nbreak down all the bounds of modesty and decorum that had made the women\r\nof her house honoured for a thousand years  and you listened to him\r\nwhilst he spoke  ohhh she quivered with her whitehot anger as the\r\nfierce heat in the heart of a furnace quivers  but her voice was cold\r\nagain as she went on\r\n\r\nbut who could help loving him  girls always did  it was such a beastly\r\nnuisance  you understood all that i dare say though perhaps he did\r\nnot put it in such plain words  then the scorn which up to now had\r\nbeen imprisoned turned on him and he felt as though some hose of\r\ndeathly chill was being played upon him\r\n\r\nand yet you knowing that only yesterday he had refused merefused my\r\npressing request that he should marry me come to me hotfoot in the\r\nearly morning and ask me to be your wife  i thought such things did not\r\ntake place that men were more honourable or more considerate or more\r\nmerciful  or at least i used to think so till yesterday  no till to\r\nday  yesterdays doings were my own doings and i had to bear the\r\npenalty of them myself  i had come here to fight out by myself the\r\nbattle of my shame    \r\n\r\nhere harold interrupted her  he could not bear to hear stephen use such\r\na word in connection with herself\r\n\r\nno  you must not say shame  there is no shame to you stephen  there\r\ncan be none and no one must say it in my presence  in her secret heart\r\nof hearts she admired him for his words she felt them at the moment sink\r\ninto her memory and knew that she would never forget the mastery of his\r\nface and bearing  but the blindness of rage was upon her and it is of\r\nthe essence of this whitehot anger that it preys not on what is basest\r\nin us but on what is best  that harold felt deeply was her opportunity\r\nto wound him more deeply than before\r\n\r\neven here in the solitude which i had chosen as the battleground of my\r\nshame you had need to come unasked unthought of when even a lesser mind\r\nthan yours for you are no fool would have thought to leave me alone  my\r\nshame was my own i tell you and i was learning to take my punishment\r\nmy punishment  poor creatures that we are we think our punishment will\r\nbe what we would like best to suffer in silence and not to have spread\r\nabroad our shame  how she harped on that word though she knew that\r\nevery time she uttered it it cut to the heart of the man who loved her\r\nand yet you come right on top of my torture to torture me still more and\r\nillimitably  you come you who alone had the power to intrude yourself\r\non my grief and sorrow power given you by my fathers kindness  you\r\ncome to me without warning considerately telling me that you knew i\r\nwould be here because i had always come here when i had been in trouble\r\nnoi do you an injustice  in trouble was not what you said but that\r\ni had come when i had been in short frocks  short frocks  and you came\r\nto tell me that you loved me  you thought i suppose that as i had\r\nrefused one man i would jump at the next that came along  i wanted a\r\nman  god god what have i done that such an affront should come upon\r\nme  and come too from a hand that should have protected me if only in\r\ngratitude for my fathers kindness  she was eyeing him keenly with\r\neyes that in her unflinching anger took in everything with the accuracy\r\nof sunpainting  she wanted to wound and she succeeded\r\n\r\nbut harold had nerves and muscles of steel and when the call came to\r\nthem they answered  though the pain of death was upon him he did not\r\nflinch  he stood before her like a rock in all his great manhood but a\r\nrock on whose summit the waves had cast the wealth of their foam for his\r\nface was as white as snow  she saw and understood but in the madness\r\nupon her she went on trying new places and new ways to wound\r\n\r\nyou thought i suppose that this poor neglected despised rejected\r\nwoman who wanted so much to marry that she couldnt wait for a man to\r\nask her would hand herself over to the first chance comer who threw his\r\nhandkerchief to her would hand over herselfand her fortune\r\n\r\noh stephen  how can you say such things think such things  the\r\nprotest broke from him with a groan  his pain seemed to inflame her\r\nstill further to gratify her hate and to stimulate her mad passion\r\n\r\nwhy did i ever see you at all  why did my father treat you as a son\r\nthat when you had grown and got strong on his kindness you could thus\r\ninsult his daughter in the darkest hour of her pain and her shame  she\r\nalmost choked with passion  there was now nothing in the whole world\r\nthat she could trust  in the pause he spoke\r\n\r\nstephen i never meant you harm  oh dont speak such wild words  they\r\nwill come back to you with sorrow afterwards  i only meant to do you\r\ngood  i wanted      her anger broke out afresh\r\n\r\nthere you speak it yourself  you only wanted to do me good  i was so\r\nbad that any kind of a husband    oh get out of my sight  i wish to\r\ngod i had never seen you  i hope to god i may never see you again  go\r\ngo  go\r\n\r\nthis was the end  to harolds honest mind such words would have been\r\nimpossible had not thoughts of truth lain behind them  that stephenhis\r\nstephen whose image in his mind shut out every other woman in the world\r\npast present and futureshould say such things to any one that she\r\nshould think such things was to him a deadly blow  but that she should\r\nsay them to him    utterance even the utterance which speaks in the\r\ninmost soul failed him  he had in some way that he knew not\r\nhurtwoundedkilled stephen for the finer part was gone from the\r\nstephen that he had known and worshipped so long  she wished him gone\r\nshe wished she had never seen him she hoped to god never to see him\r\nagain  life for him was over and done  there could be no more happiness\r\nin the world no more wish to work to live   \r\n\r\nhe bowed gravely and without a word turned and walked away\r\n\r\nstephen saw him go his tall form moving amongst the tree trunks till\r\nfinally it was lost in their massing  she was so filled with the tumult\r\nof her passion that she looked unmoved  even the sense of his going did\r\nnot change her mood  she raged to and fro amongst the trees her\r\nmovements getting quicker and quicker as her excitement began to change\r\nfrom mental to physical till the fury began to exhaust itself  all at\r\nonce she stopped as though arrested by a physical barrier and with a\r\nmoan sank down in a helpless heap on the cool moss\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nharold went from the grove as one seems to move in a dream  little\r\nthings and big were mixed up in his mind  he took note as he went\r\ntowards the town by the byroads of everything around him in his usual\r\nway for he had always been one of those who notice unconsciously or\r\nrather unintentionally  long afterwards he could shut his eyes and\r\nrecall every step of the way from the spot where he had turned from\r\nstephen to the railway station outside norcester  and on many and many\r\nsuch a time when he opened them again the eyelids were wet  he wanted to\r\nget away quickly silently unobserved  with the instinct of habitual\r\nthought his mind turned londonward  he met but few persons and those\r\nonly cottiers  he saluted them in his usual cheery way but did not stop\r\nto speak with any  he was about to take a single ticket to london when\r\nit struck him that this might look odd so he asked for a return  then\r\nhis mind being once more directed towards concealment of purpose he sent\r\na telegram to his housekeeper telling her that he was called away to\r\nlondon on business  it was only when he was far on his journey that he\r\ngave thought to ways and means and took stock of his possessions  before\r\nhe took out his purse and pocketbook he made up his mind that he would\r\nbe content with what it was no matter how little  he had left\r\nnormanstand and all belonging to it for ever and was off to hide himself\r\nin whatever part of the world would afford him the best opportunity  life\r\nwas over  there was nothing to look forward to nothing to look back at\r\nthe present was a living pain whose lightest element was despair  as\r\nhowever he got further and further away his practical mind began to\r\nwork he thought over matters so as to arrange in his mind how best he\r\ncould dispose of his affairs so to cause as little comment as might be\r\nand to save the possibility of worry or distress of any kind to stephen\r\n\r\neven then in his agony of mind his heart was with her it was not the\r\nleast among his troubles that he would have to be away from her when\r\nperhaps she would need him most  and yet whenever he would come to this\r\npoint in his endless chain of thought he would have to stop for a while\r\novercome with such pain that his power of thinking was paralysed  he\r\nwould never could never be of service to her again  he had gone out of\r\nher life as she had gone out of his life though she never had nor\r\nnever could out of his thoughts  it was all over  all the years of\r\nsweetness of hope and trust and satisfied and justified faith in each\r\nother had been wiped out by that last terrible cruel meeting  oh how\r\ncould she have said such things to him  how could she have thought them\r\nand there she was now in all the agony of her unrestrained passion  well\r\nhe knew from his long experience of her nature how she must have\r\nsuffered to be in such a state of mind to have so forgotten all the\r\nrestraint of her teaching and her life  poor poor stephen  fatherless\r\nnow as well as motherless and friendless as well as fatherless  no one\r\nto calm her in the height of her wild abnormal passion  no one to\r\ncomfort her when the fit had passed  no one to sympathise with her for\r\nall that she had suffered  no one to help her to build new and better\r\nhopes out of the wreck of her mad ideas  he would cheerfully have given\r\nhis life for her  only last night he was prepared to kill which was\r\nworse than to die for her sake  and now to be far away unable to help\r\nunable even to know how she fared  and behind her eternally the shadow\r\nof that worthless man who had spurned her love and flouted her to a\r\nchance comer in his drunken delirium  it was too bitter to bear  how\r\ncould god lightly lay such a burden on his shoulders who had all his life\r\ntried to walk in sobriety and chastity and in all worthy and manly ways\r\nit was unfair  it was unfair  if he could do anything for her\r\nanything  anything    and so the unending whirl of thoughts went on\r\n\r\nthe smoke of london was dim on the horizon when he began to get back to\r\npractical matters  when the train drew up at euston he stepped from it\r\nas one to whom death would be a joyous relief\r\n\r\nhe went to a quiet hotel and from there transacted by letter such\r\nbusiness matters as were necessary to save pain and trouble to others  as\r\nfor himself he made up his mind that he would go to alaska which he\r\ntook to be one of the best places in the as yet uncivilised world for a\r\nman to lose his identity  as a security at the start he changed his\r\nname and as john robinson which was not a name to attract public\r\nattention he shipped as a passenger on the scoriac from london to new\r\nyork\r\n\r\nthe scoriac was one of the great cargo boats which take a certain\r\nnumber of passengers  the few necessaries which he took with him were\r\nchosen with an eye to utility in that frozen land which he sought  for\r\nthe rest he knew nothing nor did he care how or whither he went  his\r\nvague purpose was to cross the american continent to san francisco and\r\nthere to take passage for the high latitudes north of the yukon river\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nwhen stephen began to regain consciousness her first sensation was one of\r\nnumbness  she was cold in the back and her feet did not seem to exist\r\nbut her head was hot and pulsating as though her brain were a living\r\nthing  then her halfopen eyes began to take in her surroundings  for\r\nanother long spell she began to wonder why all around her was green  then\r\ncame the inevitable process of reason  trees  it is a wood  how did i\r\ncome here why am i lying on the ground\r\n\r\nall at once wakened memory opened on her its floodgates and overwhelmed\r\nher with pain  with her hands pressed to her throbbing temples and her\r\nburning face close to the ground she began to recall what she could of\r\nthe immediate past  it all seemed like a terrible dream  by degrees her\r\nintelligence came back to its normal strength and all at once as does\r\none suddenly wakened from sleep to the knowledge of danger she sat up\r\n\r\nsomehow the sense of time elapsed made stephen look at her watch  it was\r\nhalfpast twelve  as she had come into the grove immediately after\r\nbreakfast and as harold had almost immediately joined her and as the\r\ninterview between them had been but short she must have lain on the\r\nground for more than three hours  she rose at once trembling in every\r\nlimb  a new fear began to assail her that she had been missed at home\r\nand that some one might have come to look for her  up to now she had not\r\nbeen able to feel the full measure of pain regarding what had passed but\r\nwhich would she knew come to her in the end  it was too vague as yet\r\nshe could not realise that it had really been  but the fear of discovery\r\nwas immediate and must be guarded against without delay  as well as she\r\ncould she tidied herself and began to walk slowly back to the house\r\nhoping to gain her own room unnoticed  that her general intelligence was\r\nawake was shown by the fact that before she left the grove she remembered\r\nthat she had forgotten her sunshade  she went back and searched till she\r\nhad found it\r\n\r\ngaining her room without meeting any one she at once change her dress\r\nfearing that some soil or wrinkle might betray her  resolutely she put\r\nback from her mind all consideration of the past there would be time for\r\nthat later on  her nerves were already much quieter than they had been\r\nthat long faint or lapse into insensibility had for the time taken the\r\nplace of sleep  there would be a price to be paid for it later but for\r\nthe present it had served its purpose  now and again she was disturbed\r\nby one thought she could not quite remember what had occurred after\r\nharold had left and just before she became unconscious  she dared not\r\ndwell upon it however  it would doubtless all come back to her when she\r\nhad leisure to think the whole matter over as a connected narrative\r\n\r\nwhen the gong sounded for lunch she went down with a calm exterior to\r\nface the dreaded ordeal of another meal\r\n\r\nluncheon passed off without a hitch  she and her aunt talked as usual\r\nover all the small affairs of the house and the neighbourhood and the\r\ncalm restraint was in itself soothing  even then she could not help\r\nfeeling how much convention is to a womans life  had it not been for\r\nthese recurring trials of set hours and duties she could never have\r\npassed the last day and night without discovery of her condition of mind\r\nthat one terrible hysterical outburst was perhaps the safety valve  had\r\nit been spread over the time occupied in conventional duties its force\r\neven then might have betrayed her but without the necessity of nerving\r\nherself to conventional needs she would have infallibly betrayed herself\r\nby her negative condition\r\n\r\nafter lunch she went to her own boudoir where when she had shut the\r\ninner door no one was allowed to disturb her without some special need\r\nin the house or on the arrival of visitors  this sporting oak was the\r\nsign of not at home which she had learned in her glimpse of college\r\nlife  here in the solitude of safety she began to go over the past\r\nresolutely and systematically\r\n\r\nshe had already been so often over the memory of the previous humiliating\r\nand unhappy day that she need not revert to it at present  since then\r\nhad she not quarrelled with harold whom she had all her life so trusted\r\nthat her quarrel with him seemed to shake the very foundations of her\r\nexistence  as yet she had not remembered perfectly all that had gone on\r\nunder the shadow of the beech grove  she dared not face it all at once\r\neven as yet  time must elapse before she should dare to cry to think of\r\nher loss of harold was to risk breaking down altogether  already she\r\nfelt weak  the strain of the last fortyeight hours was too much for her\r\nphysical strength  she began to feel as she lay back in her cushioned\r\nchair that a swoon is no worthy substitute for sleep  indeed it had\r\nseemed to make the need for sleep even more imperative\r\n\r\nit was all too humiliating  she wanted to think over what had been to\r\nrecall it as far as possible so as to fix it in her mind whilst it was\r\nstill fresh  later on some action might have to be based on her\r\nrecollection  and yet    how could she think when she was so tired\r\n   tired   \r\n\r\nnature came to the poor girls relief at last and she fell into a heavy\r\nsleep   \r\n\r\nit was like coming out of the grave to be dragged back to waking life out\r\nof such a sleep and so soon after it had begun  but the voice seemed to\r\nreach to her inner consciousness in some compelling way  for a second\r\nshe could not understand but as she rose from the cushions the maids\r\nmessage repeated brought her wide awake and alert in an instant\r\n\r\nmr everard young mr everard to see you miss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xvia private conversation\r\n\r\n\r\nthe name braced stephen at once  here was danger an enemy to be\r\nencountered all the fighting blood of generations leaped to the\r\noccasion  the short spell of sleep had helped to restore her  there\r\nremained still quite enough of mental and nervous excitement to make her\r\nthink quickly the words were hardly out of the maids mouth before her\r\nresolution was taken  it would never do to let leonard everard see she\r\nwas diffident about meeting him she would go down at once  but she\r\nwould take the precaution of having her aunt present at any rate till\r\nshe should have seen how the land lay  her being just waked from sleep\r\nwould be an excuse for asking her aunt to see the visitor till she came\r\ndown  so she said to the maid\r\n\r\ni have been asleep  i must have got tired walking in the wood in the\r\nheat  ask auntie to kindly see mr everard in the blue drawingroom till\r\ni come down  i must tidy my hair but i will be down in a few minutes\r\n\r\nshall i send marjorie to you miss\r\n\r\nno  dont mind i can do what i want myself  hurry down to miss\r\nrowly\r\n\r\nhow she regarded leonard everard now was shown in her instinctive\r\nclassing him amongst her enemies\r\n\r\nwhen she entered the room she seemed all aglow  she wanted not only to\r\novercome but to punish and all the woman in her had risen to the effort\r\nnever in her life had stephen norman looked more radiantly beautiful\r\nmore adorable more desirable  even leonard everard felt his pulses\r\nquicken as he saw that glowing mass of beauty standing out against the\r\ncold background of old french tapestry  all the physical side of him\r\nleaped in answer to the call of her beauty and even his cold heart and\r\nhis selfengrossed brain followed with slower gait  he had been sitting\r\nopposite miss rowly in one of the windows twirling his hat in nervous\r\nsuspense  he jumped up and as she came towards him went forward\r\nrapidly to greet her  no one could mistake the admiration in his eyes\r\never since he had made up his mind to marry her she had assumed a new\r\naspect in his thoughts  but now her presence swept away all false\r\nimaginings from the moment that her loveliness dawned upon him something\r\nlike love began to grow within his breast  stephen saw the look and it\r\nstrengthened her  he had so grievously wounded her pride the previous\r\nday that her victory on this was a compensation which set her more at her\r\nold poise\r\n\r\nher greeting was all sweetness she was charmed to see him  how was his\r\nfather and what was the news  miss rowly looked on with smiling visage\r\nshe too had seen the look of admiration in his eyes and it pleased her\r\nold ladies especially when they are maiden ladies always like to see\r\nadmiration in the eyes of young men when they are turned in the direction\r\nof any girl dear to them\r\n\r\nthey talked for some time keeping all the while by stephens clever\r\ngeneralship to the smalltalk of the neighbourhood and the minor events\r\nof social importance  as the time wore on she could see that leonard was\r\ngrowing impatient and evidently wanted to see her alone  she ignored\r\nhowever all his little private signalling and presently ordered tea to\r\nbe brought  this took some little time when it had been brought and\r\nserved and drunk leonard was in a smothered fume of impatience  she was\r\nglad to see that as yet her aunt had noticed nothing and she still hoped\r\nthat she would be able to so prolong matters that she would escape\r\nwithout a private interview  she did not know the cause of leonards\r\nimpatience that he must see her before the day passed  she too was an\r\negoist in her own way in the flush of belief of his subjugation she did\r\nnot think of attributing to him any other motive than his desire for\r\nherself  as she had made up her mind on the final issue she did not want\r\nto be troubled by a new scene\r\n\r\nbut after all leonard was a man and mans ways are more direct than\r\nwomans  seeing that he could not achieve his object in any other way\r\nhe said out suddenly thinking and rightly that she would not wish to\r\nforce an issue in the presence of her aunt\r\n\r\nby the way miss norman he had always called her miss norman in her\r\naunts presence i want to have two minutes with you before i go  on a\r\nmatter of business he added noticing miss rowlys surprised look  the\r\nold lady was oldfashioned even for her age in her time no young man\r\nwould have asked to see a young lady alone on business  except on one\r\nkind of business and with regard to that kind of business gentlemen had\r\nto obtain first the confidence and permission of guardians  leonard saw\r\nthe difficulty and said quickly\r\n\r\nit is on the matter you wrote to me about\r\n\r\nstephen was prepared for a nasty shock but hardly for so nasty a one as\r\nthis  there was an indelicacy about it which went far beyond the bounds\r\nof thoughtless conventionality  that such an appeal should be made to\r\nher and in such a way savoured of danger  her womans intuition gave\r\nher the guard and at once she spoke smilingly and gently as one\r\nrecalling a matter in which the concern is not her own\r\n\r\nof course  it was selfish of me not to have thought of it and to have\r\nkept you so long waiting  the fact is auntie that leonardi like to\r\ncall him leonard since we were children together and he is so young\r\nthough perhaps it would be more decorous nowadays to say mr\r\neverardhas consulted me about his debts  you know auntie dear that\r\nyoung men will be young men in such matters or perhaps you do not since\r\nthe only person who ever worried you has been myself  but i stayed at\r\noxford and i know something of young mens ways and as i am necessarily\r\nmore or less of a man of business he values my help  dont you\r\nleonard  the challenge was so direct and the position he was in so\r\ndaringly put that he had to acquiesce  miss rowly who had looked on\r\nwith a frown of displeasure said coldly\r\n\r\ni know you are your own mistress my dear  but surely it would be\r\nbetter if mr everard would consult with his solicitor or his fathers\r\nagent or some of his gentlemen friends rather than with a young lady\r\nwhose relations with him after all are only those of a neighbour on\r\nvisiting terms  for my own part i should have thought that mr\r\neverards best course would have been to consult his own father  but the\r\nthings that gentlemen as well as ladies do have been sadly changed\r\nsince my time  then rising in formal dignity she bowed gravely to the\r\nvisitor before leaving the room\r\n\r\nbut the position of being left alone in the room with leonard did not at\r\nall suit stephens plans  rising quickly she said to her aunt\r\n\r\ndont stir auntie  i dare say you are right in what you say but i\r\npromised mr everard to go into the matter  and as i have brought the\r\nawkwardness on myself i suppose i must bear it  if mr everard wants to\r\nsee me alone and i suppose he is diffident in speaking on such a matter\r\nbefore youhe didnt play with you you knowwe can go out on the\r\nlawn  we shant be long  before leonard could recover his wits she had\r\nheaded him out on the lawn\r\n\r\nher strategy was again thoroughly good  the spot she chose though\r\nbeyond earshot was quite in the open and commanded by all the windows in\r\nthat side of the house  a person speaking there might say what he liked\r\nbut his actions must be discreet\r\n\r\non the lawn stephen tripped ahead leonard followed inwardly raging  by\r\nher clever use of the opening she had put him in a difficulty from which\r\nthere was no immediate means of extrication  he could not quarrel\r\novertly with stephen if he did so how could he enter on the pressing\r\nmatter of his debts  he dared not openly proclaim his object in wishing\r\nto marry her for had he done so her aunt might have interfered with\r\nwhat success he could not be sure  in any case it would cause delay and\r\ndelay was what he could not afford  he felt that in mentioning his debts\r\nat just such a movement he had given stephen the chance she had so aptly\r\ntaken  he had to be on his good behaviour however and with an\r\napprehension that was new to him he followed her\r\n\r\nan old roman marble seat was placed at an angle from the house so that\r\nthe one of the two occupants within its curve must almost face the house\r\nwhilst the other gave to it at least a quarterface  stephen seated\r\nherself on the near side leaving to leonard the exposed position  as\r\nsoon as he was seated she began\r\n\r\nnow leonard tell me all about the debts  she spoke in tones of gay\r\nfriendliness but behind the mask of her cheerfulness was the real face\r\nof fear  down deep in her mind was a conviction that her letter was a\r\npivotal point of future sorrow  it was in the meantime quite apparent to\r\nher that leonard kept it as his last resource so her instinct was to\r\nkeep it to the front and thus minimise its power\r\n\r\nleonard though inwardly weakened by qualms of growing doubt had the\r\nanimal instinct that as he was in opposition his safety was in\r\nattacking where his opponent most feared  he felt that there was some\r\nsubtle change in his companion this was never the same stephen norman\r\nwhom only yesterday he had met upon the hill  he plunged at once into\r\nhis purpose\r\n\r\nbut it wasnt about my debts you asked me to meet you stephen\r\n\r\nyou surprise me leonard  i thought i simply asked you to come to meet\r\nme  i know the first subject i mentioned when we began to talk after\r\nyour grumbling about coming in the heat was your money matters  leonard\r\nwinced but went on\r\n\r\nit was very good of you stephen but really that is not what i came to\r\nspeak of today  at first at all events he added with a sublime\r\nnaivette as the subject of his debts and his imperative want of money\r\nrose before him  stephens eyes flashed she saw more clearly than ever\r\nthrough his purpose  such as admission at the very outset of the proffer\r\nof marriage which she felt was coming was little short of monstrous\r\nher companion did not see the look of mastery on her face he was looking\r\ndown at the moment  a true lover would have been looking up\r\n\r\ni wanted to tell you stephen that i have been thinking over what you\r\nsaid to me in your letter and what you said in words and i want to\r\naccept  as he was speaking he was looking her straight in the face\r\n\r\nstephen answered slowly with a puzzled smile which wrinkled up her\r\nforehead\r\n\r\naccept what i said in my letter why leonard what do you mean  that\r\nletter must have had a lot more in it than i thought  i seem to remember\r\nthat it was simply a line asking you to meet me  just let me look at it\r\ni should like to be sure of what actually is  as she spoke she held out\r\nher hand  leonard was nonplussed he did not know what to say  stephen\r\nmade up her mind to have the letter back  leonard was chafing under the\r\nposition forced upon him and tried to divert his companion from her\r\npurpose  he knew well why she had chosen that exposed position for their\r\ninterview  now as her outstretched hand embarrassed him he made\r\nreprisal he tried to take it in his in a tender manner\r\n\r\nshe instantly drew back her hand and put it behind her in a decided\r\nmanner  she was determined that whatever might happen she would not let\r\nany watcher at the windows by chance or otherwise see any sign of\r\ntenderness on her part  leonard thinking that his purpose had been\r\neffected went on breathing more freely\r\n\r\nyour letter wasnt much  except of course that it gave me the\r\nopportunity of listening to what you said to all your sweet words  to\r\nyour more than sweet proposal\r\n\r\nyes  it must have been sweet to have any one who was in a position to\r\ndo so offer to help you when you knew that you were overwhelmed with\r\ndebts  the words were brutal  stephen felt so but she had no\r\nalternative  leonard had some of the hard side of human nature but he\r\nhad also some of the weak side  he went on blindly\r\n\r\ni have been thinking ever since of what you said and i want to tell you\r\nthat i would like to do as you wish  as he spoke his words seemed even\r\nto him to be out of place  he felt it would be necessary to throw more\r\nfervour into the proceedings  the sudden outburst which followed\r\nactually amused stephen even in her state of fear\r\n\r\noh stephen dont you know that i love you  you are so beautiful  i\r\nlove you  i love you  wont you be my wife\r\n\r\nthis was getting too much to close quarters  stephen said in a calm\r\nbusinesslike way\r\n\r\nmy dear leonard one thing at a time  i came out here you know to\r\nspeak of your debts and until that is done i really wont go into any\r\nother matter  of course if youd rather not      leonard really\r\ncould not afford this matters were too pressing with him  so he tried\r\nto affect a cheery manner but in his heart was a black resolve that she\r\nshould yet pay for this\r\n\r\nall right stephen  whatever you wish i will do you are the queen of\r\nmy heart you know\r\n\r\nhow much is the total amount said stephen\r\n\r\nthis was a change to the prosaic which made sentiment impossible  he\r\ngave over for the time\r\n\r\ngo on said stephen following up her advantage  dont you even know\r\nhow much you owe\r\n\r\nthe fact is i dont  not exactly  i shall make up the amount as well\r\nas i can and let you know  but thats not what i came about today\r\nstephen was going to make an angry gesture of dissent  she was not going\r\nto have that matter opened up  she waited however for leonard was\r\ngoing on after his momentary pause  she breathed more freely after his\r\nfirst sentence  he was unable evidently to carry on a double train of\r\nthought\r\n\r\nit was about that infernal moneylenders letter that the governor got\r\nstephen got still less anxious  this open acknowledgment of his true\r\npurpose seemed to clear the air\r\n\r\nwhat is the amount  leonard looked quickly at her the relief of her\r\nmind made her tone seem joyful\r\n\r\na monkey  five hundred pounds you know  but then theres three\r\nhundred for interest that has to be paid also  its an awful lot of\r\nmoney isnt it  the last phrase was added on seeing stephens\r\nsurprised look\r\n\r\nyes she answered quietly  a great deal of moneyto waste  they\r\nwere both silent for a while  then she said\r\n\r\nwhat does your father say to it\r\n\r\nhe was in an awful wax  one of these beastly duns had written to him\r\nabout another account and he was in a regular fury  when i told him i\r\nwould pay it within a week he said very little which was suspicious\r\nand then just when i was going out he sprung this on me  mean of him\r\nwasnt it  i need expect no help from him  as he was speaking he took\r\na mass of letters from his pocket and began to look among them for the\r\nmoneylenders letter\r\n\r\nwhy what a correspondence you have there  do you keep all your letters\r\nin your pockets said stephen quietly\r\n\r\nall i dont tear up or burn  it wouldnt do to let the governor into my\r\nsecrets  he might know too much\r\n\r\nand are all those letters from duns\r\n\r\nmostly but i only keep those letters i have to attend to and those i\r\ncare for\r\n\r\nshow me the bundle she said  then seeing him hesitate added\r\n\r\nyou know if i am to help you to get clear you must take me into your\r\nconfidence  i dare say i shall have to see a lot more letters than these\r\nbefore you are quite clear  her tone was too quiet  knowing already\r\nthe silent antagonism between them he began to suspect her knowing also\r\nthat her own letter was not amongst them he used his wits and handed\r\nthem over without a word  she too suspected him  after his tacit\r\nrefusal to give her the letter she almost took it for granted that it\r\nwas not amongst them  she gave no evidence of her feeling however but\r\nopened and read the letters in due sequence all save two which being\r\nin a female hand she gave back without a word  there was a calmness and\r\nan utter absence of concern much less of jealousy about this which\r\ndisconcerted him  throughout her reading stephens face showed surprise\r\nnow and again but when she came to the last which was that of the\r\nusurers it showed alarm  being a woman a legal threat had certain\r\nfears of its own\r\n\r\nthere must be no delay about this she said\r\n\r\nwhat am i to do he answered a weight off his mind that the fiscal\r\nmatter had been practically entered on\r\n\r\ni shall see that you get the money she said quietly  it will be\r\nreally a gift but i prefer it to be as a loan for many reasons  leonard\r\nmade no comment   he found so many reasons in his own mind that he\r\nthought it wise to forbear from asking any of hers  then she took the\r\npractical matter in hand\r\n\r\nyou must wire to these people at once to say that you will pay the\r\namount on the day after tomorrow  if you will come here tomorrow at\r\nfour oclock the money will be ready for you  you can go up to town by\r\nthe evening train and pay off the debt first thing in the morning  when\r\nyou bring the receipt i shall speak to you about the other debts but you\r\nmust make out a full list of them  we cant have any halfmeasure  i\r\nwill not go into the matter till i have all the details before me  then\r\nshe stood up to go\r\n\r\nas they walked across the lawn she said\r\n\r\nby the way dont forget to bring that letter with you  i want to see\r\nwhat i really did say in it  her tone was quiet enough and the wording\r\nwas a request but leonard knew as well as if it had been spoken outright\r\nas a threat that if he did not have the letter with him when he came\r\nthings were likely to be unpleasant\r\n\r\nthe farther he got from normanstand on his way home the more discontented\r\nleonard grew  whilst he had been in stephens presence she had so\r\ndominated him not only by her personality but by her use of her\r\nknowledge of his own circumstances that he had not dared to make protest\r\nor opposition but now he began to feel how much less he was to receive\r\nthan he had expected  he had come prepared to allow stephen to fall into\r\nhis arms fortune and all  but now although he had practical assurance\r\nthat the weight of his debts would be taken from him he was going away\r\nwith his tail between his legs  he had not even been accepted as a\r\nsuitor he who had himself been wooed only a day before  his proposal of\r\nmarriage had not been accepted had not even been considered by the woman\r\nwho had so lately broken ironclad convention to propose marriage to him\r\nhe had been treated merely as a scapegrace debtor who had come to ask\r\nfavours from an old friend  he had even been treated like a bad boy had\r\nbeen told that he had wasted money had been ordered in no doubtful way\r\nto bring the full schedule of his debts  and all the time he dared not\r\nsay anything lest the thing shouldnt come off at all  stephen had such\r\nan infernally masterly way with her  it didnt matter whether she was\r\nproposing to him or he was proposing to her he was made to feel small\r\nall the same  he would have to put up with it till he had got rid of the\r\ndebts\r\n\r\nand then as to the letter  why was she so persistent about seeing it\r\ndid she want to get it into her hands and then keep it as harold an wolf\r\nhad done  was it possible that she suspected he would use it to coerce\r\nher she would call it blackmail he supposed  this being the very\r\nthing he had intended to do and had done he grew very indignant at the\r\nvery thought of being accused of it  it was he felt a very awkward\r\nthing that he had lost possession of the letter  he might need it if\r\nstephen got nasty  then harold might give it to her as he had\r\nthreatened to do  he thought he would call round that evening by\r\nharolds house and see if he couldnt get back the letter  it belonged\r\nto him harold had no right to keep it  he would see him before he and\r\nstephen got putting their heads together  so on his way home he turned\r\nhis steps at once to harolds house\r\n\r\nhe did not find him in  the maid who opened the door could give him no\r\ninformation all she could say was that mrs dingle the housekeeper had\r\ngot a telegram from master saying that he had been called suddenly away\r\non business\r\n\r\nthis was a new source of concern to leonard  he suspected a motive of\r\nsome sort though what that motive could be he could not hazard the\r\nwildest guess  on his way home he called at the postoffice and sent a\r\ntelegram to cavendish and cecil the name of the usurers firm in\r\naccordance with stephens direction  he signed it jasper everard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xviia business transaction\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen stephen had sent off her letter to the bank she went out for a\r\nstroll she knew it would be no use trying to get rest before dinner\r\nthat ordeal too had to be gone through  she found herself\r\nunconsciously going in the direction of the grove but when she became\r\naware of it a great revulsion overcame her and she shuddered\r\n\r\nslowly she took her way across the hard stretch of finelykept grass\r\nwhich lay on the side of the house away from the wood  the green sward\r\nlay like a sea dotted with huge trees singly or in clumps as islands\r\nin its farstretching stateliness there was something soothing  she came\r\nback to the sound of the dressinggong with a better strength to resist\r\nthe trial before her  well she knew her aunt would have something to say\r\non the subject of her interference in leonard everards affairs\r\n\r\nher fears were justified for when they had come into the drawingroom\r\nafter dinner miss rowly began\r\n\r\nstephen dear is it not unwise of you to interfere in mr everards\r\naffairs\r\n\r\nwhy unwise auntie\r\n\r\nwell my dear the world is censorious  and when a young lady of your\r\nposition and your wealth takes a part in a young mans affairs tongues\r\nare apt to wag  and also dear debts young mens debts are hardly the\r\nsubjects for a girls investigation  remember that we ladies live very\r\ndifferent lives from men from some men i should say for your dear\r\nfather was the best of men and i should think that in all his life there\r\nwas nothing which he would have wished concealed  but my dear young\r\nmen are less restrained in their ways than we are than we have to be for\r\nour own safety and protection  the poor lady was greatly perturbed at\r\nhaving to speak in such a way  stephen saw her distress coming over to\r\nher she sat down and took her hand  stephen had a very tender side to\r\nher nature and she loved very truly the dear old lady who had taken her\r\nmothers place and had shown her all a mothers love  now in her\r\nloneliness and woe and fear she clung to her in spirit  she would have\r\nliked to have clung to her physically to have laid her head on her\r\nbosom and have cried her heart out  the time for tears had not come\r\nhourly she felt more and more the weight that a shameful secret is to\r\ncarry  she knew however that she could set her aunts mind at rest on\r\nthe present subject so she said\r\n\r\ni think you are right auntie dear  it would have been better if i had\r\nasked you first but i saw that leonard was in distress and wormed the\r\ncause of it from him  when i heard that it was only debt i offered to\r\nhelp him  he is an old friend you know auntie  we were children\r\ntogether and as i have much more money than i can ever want or spend i\r\nthought i might help him  i am afraid i have let myself in for a bigger\r\nthing than i intended but as i have promised i must go on with it  i\r\ndare say auntie that you are afraid that i may end by getting in love\r\nwith him and marrying him  dont you dear  this was said with a hug\r\nand a kiss which gave the old lady delight  her instinct told her what\r\nwas coming  she nodded her head in acquiescence  stephen went on\r\ngravely\r\n\r\nput any such fear out of your mind  i shall never marry him  i can\r\nnever love him  she was going to say could never love him when she\r\nremembered\r\n\r\nare you sure my dear  the heart is not always under ones own\r\ncontrol\r\n\r\nquite sure auntie  i know leonard everard and though i have always\r\nliked him i do not respect him  why the very fact of his coming to me\r\nfor money would make me reconsider any view i had formed had nothing\r\nelse ever done so  you may take it auntie dear that in the way you\r\nmean leonard is nothing to me can never be anything to me  here a\r\nsudden inspiration took her  in its light a serious difficulty passed\r\nand the doing of a thing which had a fear of its own became easy  with a\r\nconviction in her tone which in itself aided her immediate purpose she\r\nsaid\r\n\r\ni shall prove it to you  that is if you will not mind doing something\r\nwhich will save me an embarrassment\r\n\r\nyou know i will do anything my dearest which an old woman can do for a\r\nyoung one  stephen squeezed the mittened hand which she held as she\r\nwent on\r\n\r\nas i said i have promised to lend him some money  the first instalment\r\nis to be given him tomorrow he is to call for it in the afternoon  will\r\nyou give it to him for me\r\n\r\ngladly my dear said the old lady much relieved  stephen continued\r\n\r\none other thing auntie i want you to do for me not to think of the\r\namount or to say a word to me about it  it is a large sum and i dare\r\nsay it will frighten you a little  but i have made up my mind to it  i\r\nam learning a great deal out of this auntie dear and i am quite willing\r\nto pay for my knowledge  after all money is the easiest and cheapest\r\nway of paying for knowledge  dont you agree with me\r\n\r\nmiss rowly gulped down her disappointment  she felt that she ought not\r\nto say too much now that stephen had set aside her graver fears  she\r\nconsoled herself with the thought that even a large amount of money would\r\ncause no inconvenience to so wealthy a woman as stephen  beyond this as\r\nshe would have the handing over of the money to leonard she would know\r\nthe amount  if advisable she could remonstrate  she could if necessary\r\nconsult in confidence with harold  her relief from her greater fear\r\nand her gladness at this new proof of her nieces confidence were\r\nmanifested in the extra affection with which she bade her goodnight\r\n\r\nstephen did not dare to breathe freely till she was quite alone and as\r\nshe lay quiet in her bed in the dark she thought before sleep came\r\n\r\nher first feeling was one of thankfulness that immediate danger was\r\nswerving from her  things were so shaping themselves that she need not\r\nhave any fear concerning leonard  for his own sake he would have to keep\r\nsilent  if he intended to blackmail her she would have the protection of\r\nher aunts knowledge of the loan and of her participation in it  the\r\nonly weapon that remained to him was her letter and that she would get\r\nfrom him before furnishing the money for the payment of his other debts\r\n\r\nthese things out of the way her thoughts turned to the matter of the\r\ngreater dread that of which all along she had feared to think for a\r\nmoment harold\r\n\r\nharold and her treatment of him\r\n\r\nthe first reception of the idea was positive anguish  from the moment he\r\nhad left her till now there had been no time when a consideration of the\r\nmatter was possible  time pressed or circumstances had interfered or\r\nher own personal condition had forbidden  now when she was alone the\r\nwhole awful truth burst on her like an avalanche  stephen felt the issue\r\nof her thinking before the thinking itself was accomplished and it was\r\nwith a smothered groan that she in the darkness held up her arms with\r\nfingers linked in desperate concentration of appeal\r\n\r\noh if she could only take back one hour of her life well she knew what\r\nthat hour would be  even that shameful time with leonard on the hilltop\r\nseemed innocuous beside the degrading remembrance of her conduct to the\r\nnoble friend of her whole life\r\n\r\nsadly she turned over in her bed and with shut eyes put her burning face\r\non the pillow to hide as it were from herself her abject depth of\r\nshame\r\n\r\nleonard lounged through the next morning with what patience he could  at\r\nfour oclock he was at the door of normanstand in his dogcart  this time\r\nhe had a groom with him and a suitcase packed for a nights use as he\r\nwas to go on to london after his interview with stephen  he had lost\r\nsight altogether of the matter of stephens letter or else he would have\r\nbeen more nervous\r\n\r\nhe was taken into the blue drawingroom where shortly miss rowly joined\r\nhim  he had not expected this  his mental uneasiness manifested itself\r\nin his manner and his fidgeting was not unobserved by the astute old\r\nlady  he was disconcerted overwhelmed would better have described his\r\nfeelings when she said\r\n\r\nmiss norman is sorry she cant see you today as she is making a visit\r\nbut she has given me a message for you or rather a commission to\r\ndischarge  perhaps you had better sit down at the table there are\r\nwriting materials there and i shall want a receipt of some sort\r\n\r\nstephen did not say anything about a receipt  the other smiled sweetly\r\nas she said in a calm way\r\n\r\nbut unfortunately miss norman is not here and so i have to do the best\r\ni can  i really must have some proof that i have fulfilled my trust  you\r\nsee mr everard though it is what lawyers call a friendly\r\ntransaction it is more or less a business act and i must protect\r\nmyself\r\n\r\nleonard saw that he must comply for time pressed  he sat down at the\r\ntable  taking up a pen and drawing a sheet of paper towards him he said\r\nwith what command of his voice he could\r\n\r\nwhat am i to write  the old lady took from her basket a folded sheet\r\nof notepaper and putting on her readingglasses said as she smoothed\r\nit out\r\n\r\ni think it would be well to say something like thisi leonard\r\neverard of brindehow in the parish of normanstand in the county of\r\nnorcester hereby acknowledge the receipt from miss laetitia rowly of\r\nnine hundred pounds sterling lent to me in accordance with my request\r\nthe same being to clear me of a pressing debt due by me\r\n\r\nwhen he had finished writing the receipt miss rowly looked it over and\r\nhanding it back to him said\r\n\r\nnow sign and date  he did so with suppressed anger\r\n\r\nshe folded the document carefully and put it in her pocket  then taking\r\nfrom the little pouch which she wore at her belt a roll of notes she\r\ncounted out on the table nine notes of one hundred pounds each  as she\r\nput down the last she said\r\n\r\nmiss norman asked me to say that a hundred pounds is added to the sum\r\nyou specified to her as doubtless the usurers would since you are\r\nactually behind the time promised for repayment require something extra\r\nas a solatium or to avoid legal proceedings already undertaken  in fact\r\nthat they would put more salt on your tail  the expression i regret\r\nto say is not mine\r\n\r\nleonard folded up the notes put them into his pocketbook and walked\r\naway  he did not feel like adding verbal thanks to the document already\r\nsigned  as he got near the door the thought struck him turning back he\r\nsaid\r\n\r\nmay i ask if stephen said anything about getting the document\r\n\r\ni beg your pardon she said icily did you speak of any one\r\n\r\nmiss norman i meant  miss rowlys answer to this came so smartly that\r\nit left an added sting  her arrow was fledged with two feathers so that\r\nit must shoot true her distrust of him and his own impotence\r\n\r\noh no  miss norman knows nothing of this  she simply asked me to give\r\nyou the money  this is my own doing entirely  you see i must exercise\r\nmy judgment on my dear nieces behalf  of course it may not be necessary\r\nto show her the receipt but if it should ever be advisable it is always\r\nthere\r\n\r\nhe looked at her with anger not unmixed with admiration as bowing\r\nrather lower than necessary he went out of the door saying sotto voce\r\nbetween his teeth\r\n\r\nwhen my turn comes out you go  neck and crop  quick  normanstand\r\nisnt big enough to hold us both\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xviiimore business\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen leonard tendered the eight hundred pounds in payment of his debt of\r\nfive hundred mr cavendish at first refused to take it  but when\r\nleonard calmly but firmly refused to pay a single penny beyond the\r\nobligations already incurred including interest on the full sum for one\r\nday he acquiesced  he knew the type of man fully and knew also that in\r\nall probability it would not be long before he would come to the firm\r\nagain on a borrowing errand  when such time should come he would put an\r\nextra clause into his memorandum of agreement which would allow the firm\r\nfull power to make whatever extra charge they might choose in case of the\r\nslightest default in making payment\r\n\r\nleonards visits to town had not of late been many and such as he had\r\nhad were not accompanied with a plethora of cash  he now felt that he\r\nhad earned a holiday and it was not till the third morning that he\r\nreturned to brindehow  his father made no comment on his absence his\r\nonly allusion to the subject was\r\n\r\nback all right  any news in town  there was however an unwonted\r\nsuavity in his manner which made leonard a little anxious  he busied\r\nhimself for the balance of the morning in getting together all his unpaid\r\naccounts and making a schedule of them  the total at first amazed almost\r\nas much as it frightened him  he feared what stephen would say  she had\r\nalready commented unfavourably on the one amount she had seen  when she\r\nwas face to face with this she might refuse to pay altogether  it would\r\ntherefore be wise to propitiate her  what could he do in this direction\r\nhis thoughts naturally turned to the missing letter  if he could get\r\npossession of it it would either serve as a sop or a threat  in the one\r\ncase she would be so glad to have it back that she would not stick at a\r\nfew pounds in the other it would bring her to her senses as he put in\r\nhis own mind his intention of blackmail\r\n\r\nhe was getting so tightened up in situation that as yet he could only do\r\nas he was told and keep his temper as well as he could\r\n\r\naltogether it was in a chastened mood that he made his appearance at\r\nnormanstand later in the afternoon  he was evidently expected for he\r\nwas shown into the study without a word  here miss rowly and stephen\r\njoined him  both were very kind in manner  after the usual greetings\r\nand commonplaces stephen said in a brisk businesslike way\r\n\r\nhave you the papers with you  he took the bundle of accounts from his\r\npocket and handed them to her  after his previous experience he would\r\nhave suggested had he dared that he should see stephen alone but he\r\nfeared the old lady  he therefore merely said\r\n\r\ni am afraid you will find the amount very large  but i have put down\r\neverything\r\n\r\nso he had and more than everything  at the last an idea struck him that\r\nas he was getting so much he might as well have a little more  he\r\ntherefore added several goodsized amounts which he called debts of\r\nhonour  this would he thought appeal to the feminine mind  stephen\r\ndid not look at the papers at once  she stood up holding them and said\r\nto miss rowly\r\n\r\nnow if you will talk to mr everard i will go over these documents\r\nquietly by myself  when i have been through them and understand them all\r\ni shall come back and we will see what can be done  she moved\r\ngracefully out of the room closing the door behind her  as is usual\r\nwith women she had more than one motive for her action in going away  in\r\nthe first place she wished to be alone whilst she went over the schedule\r\nof the debts  she feared she might get angry and in the present state\r\nof her mind towards leonard the expression of any feeling even contempt\r\nwould not be wise  her best protection from him would be a manifest\r\nkindly negation of any special interest  in the second place she\r\nbelieved that he would have her letter with the other papers and she did\r\nnot wish her aunt to see it lest she should recognise the writing  in\r\nher boudoir with a beating heart she untied the string and looked\r\nthrough the papers\r\n\r\nher letter was not among them\r\n\r\nfor a few seconds she stood stock still thinking  then with a sigh\r\nshe sat down and began to read the list of debts turning to the\r\noriginals now and again for details  as she went on her wonder and\r\ndisgust grew and even a sense of fear came into her thoughts  a man who\r\ncould be so wildly reckless and so selfishly unscrupulous was to be\r\nfeared  she knew his father was a comparatively poor man who could not\r\npossibly meet such a burden  if he were thus to his father what might\r\nhe be to her if he got a chance\r\n\r\nthe thought of what he might have been to her had he taken the chance\r\nshe had given him never occurred to her  this possibility had already\r\nreached the historical stage in her mind\r\n\r\nshe made a few pencil notes on the list and went back to the study  her\r\nmind was made up\r\n\r\nshe was quite businesslike and calm did not manifest the slightest\r\ndisapproval but seemed to simply accept everything as facts  she asked\r\nleonard a few questions on subjects regarding which she had made notes\r\nsuch as discounts  then she held the paper out to him and without any\r\npreliminary remark said\r\n\r\nwill you please put the names to these\r\n\r\nhow do you mean he asked flushing\r\n\r\nthe names of the persons to whom these sums marked debt of honour are\r\ndue  his reply came quickly and was a little aggressive he thought\r\nthis might be a good time to make a bluff\r\n\r\ni do not see that that is necessary  i can settle them when i have the\r\nmoney  slowly and without either pause or flurry stephen replied\r\nlooking him straight in the eyes as she handed him the papers\r\n\r\nof course it is not necessary  few things in the world really are  i\r\nonly wanted to help you out of your troubles but if you do not wish me\r\nto      leonard interrupted in alarm\r\n\r\nno no  i only spoke of these items  you see being debts of honour\r\ni ought not to give the names  looking with a keen glance at her set\r\nface he saw she was obdurate and recognising his defeat said as calmly\r\nas he could for he felt raging\r\n\r\nall right  give me the paper  bending over the table he wrote  when\r\nshe took the paper a look half surprised half indignant passed over\r\nher face  her watchful aunt saw it and bending over looked also at the\r\npaper  then she too smiled bitterly\r\n\r\nleonard had printed in the names  the feminine keenness of both women\r\nhad made his intention manifest  he did not wish for the possibility of\r\nhis handwriting being recognised  his punishment came quickly  with a\r\ndazzling smile stephen said to him\r\n\r\nbut leonard you have forgotten to put the addresses\r\n\r\nis that necessary\r\n\r\nof course it is  why you silly how is the money to be paid if there\r\nare no addresses\r\n\r\nleonard felt like a rat in a trap but he had no alternative  so\r\nirritated was he and so anxious to hide his irritation that forgetting\r\nhis own caution he wrote not in printing characters but in his own\r\nhandwriting addresses evolved from his own imagination  stephens eyes\r\ntwinkled as he handed her the paper he had given himself away all round\r\n\r\nleonard having done all that as yet had been required of him felt that\r\nhe might now ask a further favour so he said\r\n\r\nthere is one of those bills which i have promised to pay by monday\r\n\r\npromised said stephen with wideopened eyes  she had no idea of\r\nsparing him she remembered the printed names  why leonard i thought\r\nyou said you were unable to pay any of those debts\r\n\r\nagain he had put himself in a false position  he could not say that it\r\nwas to his father he had made the promise for he had already told\r\nstephen that he had been afraid to tell him of his debts  in his\r\ndesperation for miss rowlys remorseless glasses were full on him he\r\nsaid\r\n\r\ni thought i was justified in making the promise after what you said\r\nabout the pleasure it would be to help me  you remember that day on the\r\nhilltop\r\n\r\nif he had wished to disconcert her he was mistaken she had already\r\nthought over and over again of every form of embarrassment her unhappy\r\naction might bring on her at his hands  she now said sweetly and calmly\r\nso sweetly and so calmly that he with knowledge of her secret was\r\nalarmed\r\n\r\nbut that was not a promise to pay  if you will remember it was only an\r\noffer which is a very different thing  you did not accept it then  she\r\nwas herself somewhat desperate or she would not have sailed so close to\r\nthe wind\r\n\r\nah but i accepted later he said quickly feeling in his satisfaction\r\nin an epigrammatic answer a certain measure of victory  he felt his\r\nmistake when she went on calmly\r\n\r\noffers like that are not repeated  they are but phantoms after all\r\nthey come at their own choice when they do come and they stay but the\r\nmeasure of a breath or two  you cannot summon them  leonard fell into\r\nthe current of the metaphor and answered\r\n\r\ni dont know that even that is impossible  there are spells which call\r\nand recall even phantoms\r\n\r\nindeed  stephen was anxious to find his purpose\r\n\r\nleonard felt that he was getting on that he was again acquiring the\r\nupper hand so he pushed on the metaphor more and more satisfied with\r\nhimself\r\n\r\nand it is wonderful how simple some spells and these the most powerful\r\ncan be  a remembered phrase the recollection of a pleasant meeting the\r\nsmell of a forgotten flower or the sight of a forgotten letter any or\r\nall of these can through memory bring back the past  and it is often\r\nin the past that the secret of the future lies\r\n\r\nmiss rowly felt that something was going on before her which she could\r\nnot understand  anything of this mans saying which she could not fathom\r\nmust be at least dangerous so she determined to spoil his purpose\r\nwhatever it might be\r\n\r\ndear me  that is charmingly poetic  past and future memory and the\r\nsmell of flowers meetings and letters  it is quite philosophy  do\r\nexplain it all mr everard  leonard was not prepared to go on under\r\nthe circumstances  his own mention of letter although he had\r\ndeliberately used it with the intention of frightening stephen had\r\nfrightened himself  it reminded him that he had not brought had not\r\ngot the letter and that as yet he was not certain of getting the money\r\nstephen also had noted the word and determined not to pass the matter\r\nby  she said gaily\r\n\r\nif a letter is a spell i think you have a spell of mine which is a\r\nspell of my own weaving  you were to show me the letter in which i asked\r\nyou to come to see me  it was in that i think you said that i\r\nmentioned your debts but i dont remember doing so  show it to me\r\n\r\ni have not got it with me  this was said with mulish sullenness\r\n\r\nwhy not\r\n\r\ni forgot\r\n\r\nthat is a pity  it is always a pity to forget things in a business\r\ntransaction as this is  i think auntie we must wait till we have all\r\nthe documents before we can complete this transaction\r\n\r\nleonard was seriously alarmed  if the matter of the loan were not gone\r\non with at once the jewellers bill could not be paid by monday and the\r\nresult would be another scene with his father  he turned to stephen and\r\nsaid as charmingly as he could and he was all in earnest now\r\n\r\nim awfully sorry  but these debts have been so worrying me that they\r\nput lots of things out of my head  that bill to be paid on monday when\r\ni havent a feather to fly with is enough to drive a fellow off his\r\nchump  the moment i lay my hands on the letter i shall keep it with me\r\nso that i cant forget it again  wont you forgive me for this time\r\n\r\nforgive she answered with a laugh  why its not worth forgiveness\r\nit is not worth a second thought  all right  leonard make your mind\r\neasy the bill will be paid on monday  miss rowly said quietly\r\n\r\ni have to be in london on monday afternoon i can pay it for you  this\r\nwas a shock to leonard he said impulsively\r\n\r\noh i say  cant i      his words faded away as the old lady again\r\nraised her lorgnon and gazed at him calmly  she went on\r\n\r\nyou know my dear it wont be even out of my way as i have to call at\r\nmr malpass office and i can go there from the hotel in regent street\r\nthis was all news to stephen  she did not know that her aunt had\r\nintended going to london and indeed she did not know of any business\r\nwith mr malpas whose firm had been london solicitor to the rowlys for\r\nseveral generations  she had no doubt however as to the old ladys\r\nintention  it was plain to her that she wanted to help  so she thanked\r\nher sweetly  leonard could say nothing  he seemed to be left completely\r\nout of it  when stephen rose as a hint to him that it was time for him\r\nto go he said humbly as he left\r\n\r\nwould it be possible that i should have the receipt before monday\r\nevening  i want to show it to my father\r\n\r\ncertainly said the old lady answering him  i shall be back by the\r\ntwo oclock train and if you happen to be at the railway station at\r\nnorcester when i arrive i can give it to you\r\n\r\nhe went away relieved but vindictive determined in his own mind that\r\nwhen he had received the money for the rest of the debts he would see\r\nstephen when the old lady was not present and have it out with her\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xixa letter\r\n\r\n\r\non monday evening after dinner mr everard and his son sat for a while in\r\nsilence  they had not met since morning and in the presence of the\r\nservants conversation had been scrupulously polite  now though they\r\nwere both waiting to talk neither liked to begin  the older man was\r\noutwardly placid when leonard a little flushed and a little nervous of\r\nvoice began\r\n\r\nhave you had any more bills  he had expected none and thus hoped to\r\nbegin by scoring against his father  it was something of a setdown when\r\nthe latter taking some papers from his breastpocket handed them to\r\nhim saying\r\n\r\nonly these  leonard took them in silence and looked at them  all were\r\nrequests for payment of debts due by his son\r\n\r\nin each case the full bill was enclosed  he was silent a while but his\r\nfather spoke\r\n\r\nit would almost seem as if all these people had made up their minds that\r\nyou were of no further use to them  then without pausing he said but\r\nin a sharper voice\r\n\r\nhave you paid the jewellers  this is monday  without speaking leonard\r\ntook leisurely from his pocket folded paper  this he opened and after\r\ndeliberately smoothing out the folds handed it to his father  doubtless\r\nsomething in his manner had already convinced the latter that the debt\r\nwas paid  he took the paper in as leisurely a way as it had been given\r\nadjusted his spectacles and read it  seeing that his son had scored\r\nthis time he covered his chagrin with an appearance of paternal\r\nsatisfaction\r\n\r\ngood  for many reasons he was glad the debt was paid he was himself\r\ntoo poor a man to allow the constant drain his sons debts and too\r\ncareful of his position to be willing have such exposure as would come\r\nwith a county court action against his son  all the same his\r\nexasperation continued  neither was his quiver yet empty  he shot his\r\nnext arrow\r\n\r\ni am glad you paid off those usurers  leonard did not like the\r\ndefinite way he spoke  still in silence he took from his pocket a\r\nsecond paper which he handed over unfolded  mr everard read it and\r\nreturned it politely with again one word\r\n\r\ngood  for a few minutes there was silence  the father spoke again\r\n\r\nthose other debts have you paid them  with a calm deliberation so\r\nfull of tacit rudeness that it made his father flush leonard answered\r\n\r\nnot yet sir  but i shall think of them presently  i dont care to be\r\nbustled by them and i dont mean to  it was apparent that though he\r\nspoke verbally of his creditors his meaning was with regard to others\r\nalso\r\n\r\nwhen will they be paid  as his son hesitated he went on\r\n\r\ni am alluding to those who have written to me  i take it that as my\r\nestate is not entailed and as you have no income except from me the\r\ncredit which has been extended to you has been rather on my account than\r\nyour own  therefore as the matter touches my own name i am entitled to\r\nknow something of what is going on  his manner as well as his words was\r\nso threatening that leonard was a little afraid  he might imperil his\r\ninheritance  he answered quickly\r\n\r\nof course sir you shall know everything  after all you know my\r\naffairs are your affairs\r\n\r\ni know nothing of the sort  i may of course be annoyed by your affairs\r\neven dishonoured in a way by them  but i accept no responsibility\r\nwhatever  as you have made your bed so must you lie on it\r\n\r\nits all right sir i assure you  all my debts both those you know of\r\nand some you dont i shall settle very shortly\r\n\r\nhow soon  the question was sternly put\r\n\r\nin a few days  i dare say a week at furthest will see everything\r\nstraightened out\r\n\r\nthe elder man stood saying gravely as he went to the door\r\n\r\nyou will do well to tell me when the last of them is paid  there is\r\nsomething which i shall then want to tell you  without waiting for\r\nreply he went to his study\r\n\r\nleonard went to his room and made a systematic though unavailing search\r\nfor stephens letter thinking that by some chance he might have\r\nrecovered it from harold and had overlooked it\r\n\r\nthe next few days he passed in considerable suspense  he did not dare go\r\nnear normanstand until he was summoned as he knew he would be when he\r\nwas required\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nwhen miss rowly returned from her visit to london she told stephen that\r\nshe had paid the bill at the jewellers and had taken the precaution of\r\ngetting a receipt together with a duplicate for mr everard  the\r\noriginal was by her own request made out as received from miss laetitia\r\nrowly in settlement of the account of leonard everard esq the\r\nduplicate merely was recd in settlement of the account of etc\r\nstephens brows bent hit thought as she said\r\n\r\nwhy did you have it done that way auntie dear  the other answered\r\nquietly\r\n\r\ni had a reason my dear good reason  perhaps i shall tell you all\r\nabout it some day in the meantime i want you not to ask me anything\r\nabout it  i have a reason for that too  stephen wont you trust me in\r\nthis blindfold  there was something so sweet and loving in the way she\r\nmade the request that stephen was filled with emotion  she put her arms\r\nround her aunts neck and hugged her tight  then laying her head on her\r\nbosom she said with a sigh\r\n\r\noh my dear you cant know how i trust you or how much your trust is\r\nto me  you never can know\r\n\r\nthe next day the two women held a long consultation over the schedule of\r\nleonards debts  neither said a word of disfavour or even commented on\r\nthe magnitude  the only remark touching on the subject was made by miss\r\nrowly\r\n\r\nwe must ask for proper discounts  oh the villainy of those tradesmen\r\ni do believe they charge double in the hope of getting half  as to\r\njewellers      then she announced her intention of going up to town\r\nagain on thursday at which visit she would arrange for the payment of\r\nthe various debts  stephen tried to remonstrate but she was obdurate\r\nshe held stephens hand in hers and stroked it lovingly as she kept on\r\nrepeating\r\n\r\nleave it all to me dear  leave it all to me  everything shall be paid\r\nas you wish but leave it to me\r\n\r\nstephen acquiesced  this gentle yielding was new in her it touched the\r\nelder lady to the quick even whilst it pained her  well she knew that\r\nsome trouble must have gone to the smoothing of that imperious nature\r\n\r\nstephens inner life in these last few days was so bitterly sad that she\r\nkept it apart from all the routine of social existence  into it never\r\ncame now except as the exciting cause of all the evil a thought of\r\nleonard  the saddening memory was of harold  and of him the sadness was\r\nincreased and multiplied by a haunting fear  since he had walked out of\r\nthe grove she had not seen him nor heard from him  this was in itself\r\nstrange for in all her life when she was at home and he too never a\r\nday passed without her seeing him  she had heard her aunt say that word\r\nhad come of his having made a sudden journey to london from which he had\r\nnot yet returned  she was afraid to make inquiries  partly lest she\r\nmight hear bad newsthis was her secret fear partly lest she might\r\nbring some attention to herself in connection with his going  of some\r\nthings in connection with her conduct to him she was afraid to think at\r\nall  thought she felt would come in time and with it new pains and\r\nnew shames of which as yet she dared not think\r\n\r\none morning came an envelope directed in harolds hand  the sight made\r\nher almost faint  she rejoiced that she had been first down and had\r\nopened the postbag with her own key  she took the letter to her room and\r\nshut herself in before opening it  within were a few lines of writing\r\nand her own letter to leonard in its envelope  her head beat so hard\r\nthat she could scarcely see but gradually the writing seemed to grow out\r\nof the mist\r\n\r\nthe enclosed should be in your hands  it is possible that it may\r\ncomfort you to know that it is safe  whatever may come god love and\r\nguard you\r\n\r\nfor a moment joy hot and strong blazed through her  the last words\r\nwere ringing through her brain  then came the cold shock and the gloom\r\nof fear  harold would never have written thus unless he was going away\r\nit was a farewell\r\n\r\nfor a long time she stood motionless holding the letter in her hand\r\nthen she said half aloud\r\n\r\ncomfort  comfort  there is no more comfort in the world for me  never\r\nnever again  oh harold  harold\r\n\r\nshe sank on her knees beside her bed and buried her face in her cold\r\nhands sobbing in all that saddest and bitterest phase of sorrow which\r\ncan be to a womans heart the sorrow that is dryeyed and without hope\r\n\r\npresently the habit of caution which had governed her last days woke her\r\nto action  she bathed her eyes smoothed her hair locked the letter and\r\nits enclosure in the little jewelsafe let into the wall and came down\r\nto breakfast\r\n\r\nthe sense of loss was so strong on her that she forgot herself  habit\r\ncarried her on without will or voluntary effort and so faithfully\r\nworked to her good that even the loving eyes of her auntand the eyes of\r\nlove are keenhad no suspicion that any new event had come into her\r\nlife\r\n\r\nnot till she was alone in her room that night did stephen dare to let her\r\nthoughts run freely  in the darkness her mind began to work truly so\r\ntruly that she began at the first step of logical process to study\r\nfacts  and to study them she must question till she found motive\r\n\r\nwhy had harold sent her the letter  his own words said that it should be\r\nin her hands  then again he said it might comfort her to know the\r\nletter was safe  how could it comfort her  how did he get possession of\r\nthe letter\r\n\r\nthere she began to understand her quick intuition and her old knowledge\r\nof harolds character and her new knowledge of leonards helped her to\r\nreconstruct causes  in his interview with her he had admitted that\r\nleonard had told him much all  he would no doubt have refused to\r\nbelieve him and leonard would have shown him as proof her letter\r\nasking him to meet her  he would have seen then as she did now how\r\nmuch the possession of that letter might mean to any one\r\n\r\ngood god to any one  could it have been so to harold himself   \r\nthat he thought to use it as an engine to force her to meet his\r\nwishesas leonard had already tried to do  the mistrust founded on her\r\nfear was not dead yet    no no no  her whole being resented such a\r\nmonstrous proposition  besides there was proof  thank god there was\r\nproof  a blackmailer would have stayed close to her and would have kept\r\nthe letter harold did neither  her recognition of the truth was shown\r\nin her act when stretching out her arms in the darkness she whispered\r\npleadingly\r\n\r\nforgive me harold\r\n\r\nand harold far away where the setting sun was lying red on the rim of\r\nthe western sea could not hear her  but perhaps god did\r\n\r\nas then harolds motive was not of the basest it must have been of the\r\nnoblest  what would be a mans noblest motive under such circumstances\r\nsurely selfsacrifice\r\n\r\nand yet there could be no doubt as to harolds earnestness when he had\r\ntold her that he loved her   \r\n\r\nhere stephen covered her face in one moment of rapture  but the gloom\r\nthat followed was darker than the night  she did not pursue the thought\r\nthat would come later when she should understand\r\n\r\nand yet so little do we poor mortals know the verities of things so\r\nblind are we to things thrust before our eyes that she understood more\r\nin that moment of ecstasy than in all the reasoning that preceded and\r\nfollowed it  but the reasoning went on\r\n\r\nif he really loved and told her so wherein was the selfsacrifice  she\r\nhad reproached him with coming to her with his suit hotfoot upon his\r\nknowledge of her shameful proffer of herself to another man of her\r\nrefusal by him  could he have been so blind as not to have seen as she\r\ndid the shameful aspect of his impulsive act  surely if he had\r\nthought he must have seen    and he must have thought there had\r\nbeen time for it  it was at dinner that he had seen leonard it was\r\nafter breakfast when he had seen her    and if he had seen then   \r\n\r\nin an instant it all burst upon her the whole splendid truth  he had\r\nheld back the expression of his long love for her waiting for the time\r\nwhen her maturity might enable her to understand truly and judge wisely\r\nwaiting till her grief for the loss of her father had become a story of\r\nthe past waiting for god knows what a mans mind sees of obstacles when\r\nhe loves  but he had spoken it out when it was to her benefit  what\r\nthen had been his idea of her benefit  was it that he wished to meet\r\nthe desire that she had manifested to have some man toto love   \r\nthe way she covered her face with her hands whilst she groaned aloud made\r\nher answer to her own query a perfect negative\r\n\r\nwas it then to save her from the evil of marrying leonard in case he\r\nshould repent of his harshness and later on yield himself to her wooing\r\nthe fierce movement of her whole body which almost threw the clothes\r\nfrom her bed as the shameful recollection rolled over her marked the\r\nmeasure of her selfdisdain\r\n\r\none other alternative there was but it seemed so remote so farfetched\r\nso noble so unlike what a woman would do that she could only regard it\r\nin a shamefaced way  she put the matter to herself questioningly and\r\nwith a meekness which had its roots deeper than she knew  and here out\r\nof the depths of her humility came a noble thought  a noble thought\r\nwhich was a noble truth  through the darkness of the night through the\r\ninky gloom of her own soul came with that thought a ray of truth which\r\nwhilst it showed her her own shrivelled unworthiness made the man whom\r\nshe had dishonoured with insults worse than death stand out in noble\r\nrelief  in that instant she guessed at and realised harolds unselfish\r\nnobility of purpose the supreme effort of his constant love  knowing\r\nthe humiliation she must have suffered at leonards hands he had so\r\nplaced himself that even her rejection of him might be some solace to her\r\nwounded spirit her pride\r\n\r\nhere at last was truth  she knew it in the very marrow of her bones\r\n\r\nthis time she did not move  she thought and thought of that noble\r\ngentleman who had used for her sake even that pentup passion which for\r\nher sake also he had suppressed so long\r\n\r\nin that light which restored in her eyes and justified so fully the man\r\nwhom she had always trusted her own shame and wrongdoing and the perils\r\nwhich surrounded her were for the time forgotten\r\n\r\nand its glory seemed to rest upon her whilst she slept\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxconfidences\r\n\r\n\r\nmiss rowly had received a bulky letter by the mornings post  she had\r\nnot opened it but had allowed it to rest beside her plate all breakfast\r\ntime  then she had taken it away with her to her own sittingroom\r\nstephen did not appear to take any notice of it  she knew quite well\r\nthat it was from some one in london whom her aunt had asked to pay\r\nleonards bills  she also knew that the old lady had some purpose in her\r\nreticence so she waited  she was learning to be patient in these days\r\nmiss rowly did say anything about it that day or the next or the next\r\nthe thirdmorning she received another letter which she had read in an\r\nenlightening manner  she began its perusal with set brow frowning then\r\nshe nodded her head and smiled  she put the letter back in its envelope\r\nand placed it in the little bag always carried  but she said nothing\r\nstephen wondered but waited\r\n\r\nthat night when stephens maid had left her there came a gentle tap at\r\nher door and an instant after the door opened  the tap had been a\r\nwarning not a request it had in a measure prepared stephen who was not\r\nsurprised to see her aunt in dressinggown though it was many a long day\r\nsince she had visited her nieces room at night  she closed the door\r\nbehind her saying\r\n\r\nthere is something i want to talk to you about dearest and i thought\r\nit would be better to do so when there could not be any possible\r\ninterruption  and besides here there was a little break in her voice\r\ni could hardly summon up my courage in the daylight  she stopped and\r\nthe stopping told its own story  in an instant stephens arms were\r\nround her all the protective instinct in her awake at the distress of\r\nthe woman she loved  the old lady took comfort from the warmth of the\r\nembrace and held her tight whilst she went on\r\n\r\nit is about these bills my dear  come and sit down and put a candle\r\nnear me  i want you to read something\r\n\r\ngo on auntie dear she said gravely  the old lady after a pause\r\nspoke with a certain timidity\r\n\r\nthey are all paid at least all that can be  perhaps i had better read\r\nyou the letter i have had from my solicitors\r\n\r\ndear madamin accordance with your instructions we have paid all the\r\naccounts mentioned in schedule a enclosed  we have placed for your\r\nconvenience three columns  the original amount of each account \r\nthe amount of discount we were able to arrange and  the amount paid\r\nwe regret that we have been unable to carry out your wishes with regard\r\nto the items enumerated in schedule b enclosed  we have we assure\r\nyou done all in our power to find the gentlemen whose names and\r\naddresses are therein given  these were marked debt of honour in the\r\nlist you handed to us  not having been able to obtain any reply to our\r\nletters we sent one of our clerks first to the addresses in london and\r\nafterwards to oxford  that clerk who is well used to such inquiries\r\ncould not find trace of any of the gentlemen or indeed of their\r\nexistence  we have therefore come to the conclusion that either there\r\nmust be some error with regard to a names b addresses or c both\r\nor that no such persons exist  as it would be very unlikely that such\r\nerrors could occur in all the cases we can only conclude that there have\r\nnot been any such persons  if we may hazard an opinion it is possible\r\nthat these debts being what young men call debts of honour the\r\ndebtor or possibly the creditors may not have wished the names\r\nmentioned  in such case fictitious names and addresses may have been\r\nsubstituted for the real ones  if you should like any further inquiry\r\ninstituted we would suggest that you ascertain the exact names and\r\naddresses from the debtor  or should you prefer it we would see the\r\ngentleman on your behalf on learning from you his name and address  we\r\ncan keep in the person of either one of the firm or a confidential clerk\r\nas you might prefer any appointment in such behalf you may care to make\r\n\r\nwe have already sent to you the receipted account from each of the\r\ncreditors as you directed viz received from miss laetitia rowly in\r\nfull settlement to date of the account due by mr leonard everard the sum\r\nof etc etc  and also as you further directed a duplicate receipt of\r\nthe sumtotal due in each case made out as received in full settlement\r\nto date of account due by etc etc  the duplicate receipt was pinned\r\nat the back of each account so as to be easily detachable\r\n\r\nwith regard to finance we have carried out your orders etc  she\r\nhurried on the reading  these sums together with the amounts of nine\r\nhundred pounds sterling and seven hundred pounds sterling lodged to the\r\naccount of miss stephen norman in the norcester branch of the bank as\r\nrepayment of moneys advanced to you as by your written instructions have\r\nexhausted the sum etc  she folded up the letter with the schedules\r\nlaying the bundle of accounts on the table  stephen paused she felt it\r\nnecessary to collect herself before speaking\r\n\r\nauntie dear will you let me see that letter  oh my dear dear auntie\r\ndont think i mistrust you that i ask it  i do because i love you and\r\nbecause i want to love you more if it is possible to do so  miss rowly\r\nhanded her the letter  she rose from the arm of the chair and stood\r\nbeside the table as though to get better light from the candle than she\r\ncould get from where she had sat\r\n\r\nshe read slowly and carefully to the end then folded up the letter and\r\nhanded it to her aunt  she came back to her seat on the edge of the\r\nchair and putting her arms round her companions neck looked her\r\nstraight in the eyes  the elder woman grew embarrassed under the\r\nscrutiny she coloured up and smiled in a deprecatory way as she said\r\n\r\ndont look at me like that darling and dont shake your head so  it\r\nis all right  i told you i had my reasons and you said you would trust\r\nme  i have only done what i thought best\r\n\r\nbut auntie you have paid away more than half your little fortune  i\r\nknow all the figures  father and uncle told me everything  why did you\r\ndo it  why did you do it  the old woman held out her arms as she said\r\n\r\ncome here dear one and sit on my knee as you used to when you were a\r\nchild and i will whisper you  stephen sprang from her seat and almost\r\nthrew herself into the loving arms  for a few seconds the two clasped\r\ntight to each others heart rocked gently to and fro  the elder kissed\r\nthe younger and was kissed impulsively in return  then she stroked the\r\nbeautiful bright hair with her wrinkled hand and said admiringly\r\n\r\nwhat lovely hair you have my dear one  stephen held her closer and\r\nwaited\r\n\r\nwell my dear i did it because i love you\r\n\r\ni know that auntie you have never done anything else my life\r\n\r\nthat is true dear one  but it is right that i should do this  now you\r\nmust listen to me and not speak till i have done  keep your thoughts on\r\nmy words so that you may follow my thoughts  you can do your own\r\nthinking about them afterwards  and your own talking too i shall listen\r\nas long as you like\r\n\r\ngo on ill be good\r\n\r\nmy dear it is not right that you should appear to have paid the debts\r\nof a young man who is no relation to you and who will i know well never\r\nbe any closer to you than he is now  she hurried on as though fearing\r\nan interruption but stephen felt that her clasp tightened  we never\r\ncan tell what will happen as life goes on  and as the world is full of\r\nscandal one cannot be too careful not to give the scandalmongers\r\nanything to exercise their wicked spite upon  i dont trust that young\r\nman he is a bad one all round or i am very much mistaken  and my\r\ndear come close to me  i cannot but see that you and he have some\r\nsecret which he is using to distress you  she paused and her clasp\r\ngrew closer still as stephens head sank on her breast  i know you have\r\ndone something or said something foolish of which he has a knowledge  and\r\ni know my dear one that whatever it was and no matter how foolish it\r\nmay have been it was not a wrong thing  god knows we are all apt to do\r\nwrong things as well as foolish ones the best of us  but such is not\r\nfor you  your race your father and mother your upbringing yourself\r\nand the truth and purity which are yours would save you from anything\r\nwhich was in itself wrong  that i know my dear as well as i know\r\nmyself  ah better far better for the gods did not think it well to\r\ndower me as they have dowered you  the god of all the gods has given you\r\nthe ten talents to guard and he knows as i do that you will be\r\nfaithful to your trust\r\n\r\nthere was a solemn ring in her voce as the words were spoken which went\r\nthrough the young girls heart  love and confidence demanded in return\r\nthat she should have at least the relief of certain acquiescence there\r\nis a possible note of pain in the tensity of every string  stephen\r\nlifted her head proudly and honestly though her cheeks were scarlet\r\nsaying with a consciousness of integrity which spoke directly soul to\r\nsoul\r\n\r\nyou are right dear  i have done something very foolish very very\r\nfoolish  but it was nothing which any one could call wrong  do not ask\r\nme what it was  i need only tell you this that it was an outrage on\r\nconvention  it was so foolish and based on such foolish misconception\r\nit sprang from such overweening arrogant selfopinion that it deserves\r\nthe bitter punishment which will come which is coming which is with me\r\nnow  it was the cause of something whose blackness i cant yet realise\r\nbut of which i will tell you when i can speak of it  but it was not\r\nwrong in itself or in the eyes of god or man  the old woman said not a\r\nword  no word was needed for had she not already expressed her belief\r\nbut stephen felt her relief in the glad pressure of her fingertips  in\r\na voice less strained and tense miss rowly went on\r\n\r\nwhat need have i for money dear  here i have all that any woman\r\nespecially at my age can need  there is no room even for charity you\r\nare so good to all your people that my help is hardly required  and my\r\ndear one i knowi know she emphasised the word as she stroked the\r\nbeautiful hair that when i am gone my own poor the few that i have\r\nlooked after all my life will not suffer when my darling thinks of me\r\nstephen fairly climbed upon her as she said looking in the brave old\r\neyes\r\n\r\nso help me god my darling they shall never want\r\n\r\nsilence for a time and then miss rowlys voice again\r\n\r\nthough it would not do for the world to know that a young maiden lady\r\nhad paid the debts of a vicious young man it makes no matter if they be\r\npaid by an old woman be the same maid wife or widow  and really my\r\ndear i do not see how any money i might have could be better spent than\r\nin keeping harm away from you\r\n\r\nthere need not be any harm at all auntie\r\n\r\nperhaps not dear  i hope not with all my heart  but i fear that young\r\nman  just fancy him threatening you and in your own house in my very\r\npresence  oh yes my dear  he meant to threaten anyhow  though i\r\ncould not exactly understand what he was driving at i could see that he\r\nwas driving at something  and after all that you were doing for him and\r\nhad done for him  i mean of course after all that i had done for him\r\nand was doing for him  it is mean enough surely for a man to beg and\r\nfrom a woman but to threaten afterwards  ach  but i think my dear it\r\nis checkmate to him this time  all along the line the only proof that is\r\nof there being any friendliness towards him from this house points to me\r\nand moreover my dear i have a little plan in my head that will tend to\r\nshow him up even better in case he may ever try to annoy us  look at me\r\nwhen next he is here  i mean to do a little playacting which will\r\nastonish him i can tell you if it doesnt frighten him out of the house\r\naltogether  but we wont talk of that yet  you will understand when you\r\nsee it  her eyes twinkled and her mouth shut with a loud snap as she\r\nspoke\r\n\r\nafter a few minutes of repose which was like a glimpse of heaven to\r\nstephens aching heart she spoke again\r\n\r\nthere was something else that troubled you more than even this  you\r\nsaid you would tell me when you were able to speak of it    why not\r\nspeak now  oh my dear our hearts are close together tonight and in\r\nall your life you will never have any one who will listen with greater\r\nsympathy than i will or deal more tenderly with your fault whatever it\r\nmay have been  tell me dear  dear she whispered after a pause\r\nduring which she realised the depth of the girls emotion by her\r\nconvulsive struggling to keep herself in check\r\n\r\nall at once the tortured girl seemed to yield herself and slipped\r\ninertly from her grasp till kneeling down she laid her head in the\r\nmotherly lap and sobbed  miss rowly kept stroking her hair in silence\r\npresently the girl looked up and with a pang the aunt saw that her eyes\r\nwere dry  in her pain she said\r\n\r\nyou sob like that my child and yet you are not crying what is it oh\r\nmy dear one  what is it that hurts you so that you cannot cry\r\n\r\nand then the bitter sobbing broke out again but still alas without\r\ntears  crouching low and still enclosing her aunts waist with her\r\noutstretched arms and hiding her head in her breast she said\r\n\r\noh auntie i have sent harold away\r\n\r\nwhat my dear  what said the old lady astonished  why i thought\r\nthere was no one in the world that you trusted so much as harold\r\n\r\nit is true  there wasthere is no one except you whom i trust so much\r\nbut i mistook something he said  i was in a blind fury at the time and\r\ni said things that i thought my fathers daughter never could have said\r\nand she never thought them even then  oh auntie i drove him away with\r\nall the horrible things i could say that would wound him  and all\r\nbecause he acted in a way that i see now was the most noble and knightly\r\nin which any man could act  he that my dear father had loved and\r\nhonoured and trusted as another son  he that was a real son to him and\r\nnot a mock sop like me  i sent him away with such fierce and bitter pain\r\nthat his poor face was ashen grey and there was woe in his eyes that\r\nshall make woe in mine whenever i shall see them in my mind waking or\r\nsleeping  he the truest friend    the most faithful the most\r\ntender the most strong the most unselfish  oh auntie auntie he just\r\nturned and bowed and went away  and he couldnt do anything else with\r\nthe way i spoke to him and now i shall never see him again\r\n\r\nthe young girls eyes ware still dry but the old womans were wet  for\r\na few minutes she kept softly stroking the bowed heat till the sobbing\r\ngrew less and less and then died away and the girl lay still collapsed\r\nin the abandonment of dryeyed grief\r\n\r\nthen she rose and taking off her dressinggown said tenderly\r\n\r\nlet me stay with you tonight dear one  go to sleep in my arms as you\r\ndid long ago when there was any grief that you could not bear\r\n\r\nso stephen lay in those loving arms till her own young breast ceased\r\nheaving and she breathed softly  till dawn she slept on the bosom of\r\nher who loved her so well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxithe duty of courtesy\r\n\r\n\r\nleonard was getting tired of waiting when he received his summons to\r\nnormanstand  but despite his impatience he was ill pleased with the\r\nsummons which came in the shape of a polite note from miss rowly asking\r\nhim to come that afternoon at teatime  he had expected to hear from\r\nstephen\r\n\r\ndamn that old woman  youd think she was working the whole show\r\nhowever he turned up at a little before five oclock spruce and dapper\r\nand well dressed and groomed as usual  he was shown as before into the\r\nblue drawingroom  miss rowly who sat there rose as he entered and\r\ncoming across the room greeted him as he thought effusively  he\r\nactually winced when she called him my dear boy before the butler\r\n\r\nshe ordered tea to be served at once and when it had been brought she\r\nsaid to the butler\r\n\r\ntell mannerly to bring me a large thick envelope which is on the table\r\nin my room  it is marked le on the outside  presently an elderly\r\nmaid handed her the envelope and withdrew  when tea was over she opened\r\nthe envelope and taking from it a number of folios looked over them\r\ncarefully holding them in her lap she said quietly\r\n\r\nyou will find writing materials on the table  i am all ready now to\r\nhand you over the receipts  his eyes glistened  this was good news at\r\nall events the debts were paid  in a rapid flash of thought he came to\r\nthe conclusion that if the debts were actually paid he need not be civil\r\nto the old lady  he felt that he could have been rude to her if he had\r\nactual possession of the receipts  as it was however he could not yet\r\nafford to have any unpleasantness  there was still to come that lowering\r\ninterview with his father and he could not look towards it\r\nsatisfactorily until he had the assurance of the actual documents that he\r\nwas safe  miss rowly was in her own way reading his mind in his face\r\nher lorgnon seemed to follow his every expression like a searchlight  he\r\nremembered his former interview with her and how he had been bested in\r\nit so he made up his mind to acquiesce in time  he went over to the\r\ntable and sat down  taking a pen he turned to miss rowly and said\r\n\r\nwhat shall i write  she answered calmly\r\n\r\ndate it and then say received from miss laetitia rowly the receipts\r\nfor the following amounts from the various firms hereunder enumerated\r\nshe then proceeded to read them he writing and repeating as he wrote\r\nthen she added\r\n\r\nthe same being the total amount of my debts which she has kindly paid\r\nfor me  he paused here she asked\r\n\r\nwhy dont you go on\r\n\r\ni thought it was stephenmiss norman he corrected catching sight of\r\nher lorgnon who was paying them\r\n\r\ngood lord man she answered what does it matter who has paid them\r\nso long as they are paid\r\n\r\nbut i didnt ask you to pay them he went on obstinately  there was a\r\npause and then the old lady with a distinctly sarcastic smile said\r\n\r\nit seems to me young man that you are rather particular as to how\r\nthings are done for you  if you had begun to be just a little bit as\r\nparticular in making the debts as you are in the way of having them paid\r\nthere would be a little less trouble and expense all round  however the\r\ndebts have been paid and we cant unpay them  but of course you can\r\nrepay me the money if you like  it amounts in all to four thousand three\r\nhundred and seventeen pounds twelve shillings and sixpence and i have\r\npaid every penny of it out of my own pocket  if you cant pay it\r\nyourself perhaps your father would like to do so\r\n\r\nthe last shot told he went on writing kindly paid for me she\r\ncontinued in the same even voice\r\n\r\nin remembrance of my mother of whom she was an acquaintance  now\r\nsign it  he did so and handed it to her  she read it over carefully\r\nfolded it and put it in her pocket  she then stood  he rose also and\r\nas he moved to the doorhe had not offered to shake hands with herhe\r\nsaid\r\n\r\ni should like to see miss norman\r\n\r\ni am afraid you will have to wait\r\n\r\nwhy\r\n\r\nshe is over at heply regis  she went there for lady heplys ball and\r\nwill remain for a few days  good afternoon  the tone in which the last\r\ntwo words were spoken seemed in his ears like the crow of the victor\r\nafter a cockfight\r\n\r\nas he was going out of the room a thought struck her  she felt he\r\ndeserved some punishment for his personal rudeness to her  after all\r\nshe had paid half her fortune for him though not on his account and not\r\nonly had he given no thanks but had not even offered the usual courtesy\r\nof saying goodbye  she had intended to have been silent on the subject\r\nand to have allowed him to discover it later  now she said as if it was\r\nan afterthought\r\n\r\nby the way i did not pay those items you put down as debts of honour\r\nyou remember you gave the actual names and addresses\r\n\r\nwhy not the question came from him involuntarily  the persecuting\r\nlorgnon rose again\r\n\r\nbecause they were all bogus  addresses names debts honour  good\r\nafternoon\r\n\r\nhe went out flaming free from debt money debts all but one  and some\r\nother debtsnot financialwhose magnitude was exemplified in the\r\ngrinding of his teeth\r\n\r\nafter breakfast next morning he said to his father\r\n\r\nby the way you said you wished to speak to me sir  there was\r\nsomething in the tone of his voice which called up antagonism\r\n\r\nthen you have paid your debts\r\n\r\nall\r\n\r\ngood  now there is something which it is necessary i should call your\r\nattention to  do you remember the day on which i handed you that\r\npleasing epistle from messrs cavendish and cecil\r\n\r\ncertainly sir\r\n\r\ndidnt you send a telegram to them\r\n\r\ni did\r\n\r\nyou wrote it yourself\r\n\r\ncertainly\r\n\r\ni had a courteous letter from the moneylenders thanking me for my\r\nexertions in securing the settlement of their claim and saying that in\r\naccordance with the request in my telegram they had held over proceedings\r\nuntil the day named  i did not quite remember having sent any telegram\r\nto them or any letter either  so being at a loss i went to our\r\nexcellent postmaster and requested that he would verify the sending of a\r\ntelegram to london from me  he courteously looked up the file which was\r\nready for transference to the gpo and showed me the form  it was in\r\nyour handwriting  he paused so long that leonard presently said\r\n\r\nwell\r\n\r\nit was signed jasper everard  jasper everard my name and yet it was\r\nsent by my son who was christened if i remember rightly leonard  then\r\nhe went on only in a cold acrid manner which made his son feel as though\r\na february wind was blowing on his back\r\n\r\ni think there need not have been much trouble in learning to avoid\r\nconfusing our names  they are really dissimilar  have you any\r\nexplanation to offer of thethe error let us call it  a bright\r\nthought struck leonard\r\n\r\nwhy sir he said i put it in your name as they had written to you  i\r\nthought it only courteous  the elder man winced he had not expected\r\nthe excuse  we went on speaking in the same calm way but his tone was\r\nmore acrid than before\r\n\r\ngood of course  it was only courteous of you  quite so  but i think\r\nit will be well in the future to let me look after my own courtesy as\r\nregards my signature at any rate  you see my dear boy a signature is\r\nqueer sort of thing and judges and juries are apt to take a poor view of\r\ncourtesy as over against the conventions regarding a man writing his own\r\nname  what i want to tell you is this that on seeing that signature i\r\nmade a new will  you see my estate is not entailed and therefore i\r\nthink it only right to see that in such a final matter justice is done\r\nall round  i therefore made a certain provision of which i am sure you\r\nwill approve  indeed since i am assured of the payment of your debts i\r\nfeel justified in my action  i may say inter alia that i congratulate\r\nyou on either the extent of your resources or the excellence of your\r\nfriendships or both  i confess that the amounts brought to my notice\r\nwere rather large more especially in proportion to the value of the\r\nestate which you are some day to inherit  for you are of course to\r\ninherit some day my dear boy  you are my only son and it would be\r\nhardlyhardly courteous of me not to leave it to you  but i have put a\r\nclause in my will to the effect that the trustees are to pay all debts\r\nof your accruing which can be proved against you before handing over to\r\nyou either the estate itself or the remainder after its sale and the\r\nsettlement of all claims  thats all  now run away my boy i have some\r\nimportant work to do\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nthe day after her return from heply regis stephen was walking in the\r\nwood when she thought she heard a slight rustling of leaves some way\r\nbehind her  she looked round expecting to see some one but the leafy\r\npath was quite clear  her suspicion was confirmed some one was secretly\r\nfollowing her  a short process of exclusions pointed to the personality\r\nof the some one  tramps and poachers were unknown in normanstand and\r\nthere was no one else whom she could think of who had any motive in\r\nfollowing her in such a way it must be leonard everard  she turned and\r\nwalked rapidly in the opposite direction  as this would bring her to the\r\nhouse leonard had to declare his presence at once or else lose the\r\nopportunity of a private interview which he sought  when she saw him she\r\nsaid at once and without any salutation\r\n\r\nwhat are you doing there why are you following me\r\n\r\ni wanted to see you alone  i could not get near you on account of that\r\ninfernal old woman  stephens face grew hard\r\n\r\non account of whom she asked with dangerous politeness\r\n\r\nmiss rowly your aunt\r\n\r\ndont you think mr everard she said icily that it is at least an\r\nunpardonable rudeness to speak that way and to me of the woman i love\r\nbest in all the world\r\n\r\nsorry he said in the offhand way of younger days i apologise  fact\r\nis i was angry that she wouldnt let me see you\r\n\r\nnot let you see me she said as if amazed  what do mean\r\n\r\nwhy i havent been able to see you alone ever since i went to meet you\r\non caester hill\r\n\r\nbut why should you see me alone she asked as if still in amazement\r\nsurely you can say anything you have to say before my aunt  with an\r\nunwisdom for which an instant later he blamed himself he blurted out\r\n\r\nwhy old girl you yourself did not think her presence necessary when\r\nyou asked me to meet you on the hill\r\n\r\nwhen was that  she saw that he was angry and wanted to test him to\r\ntry how far he would venture  he was getting dangerous she must know\r\nthe measure of what she had to fear\r\n\r\nhe fell into the trap at once  his debts being paid fear was removed\r\nand all the hectoring side of the man was aroused  his antagonist was a\r\nwoman and he had already had in his life so many unpleasant scenes with\r\nwomen that this was no new experience  this woman had by her own\r\nindiscretion put a whip into his hand and if necessary to secure his\r\nown way by god he meant to use it  these last days had made her a more\r\ndesirable possession in his eyes  the vastness of her estate had taken\r\nhold on him and his fathers remorseless intention with regard to his\r\nwill would either keep him with very limited funds or leave him\r\neventually a pauper if he forestalled his inheritance  the desire of her\r\nwealth had grown daily and it was now the main force in bringing him\r\nhere today  and to this was now added the personal desire which her\r\npresence evoked  stephen at all times beautiful had never looked more\r\nlovely  in the days since she had met him on the hilltop a time that to\r\nher seemed so long ago she had grown to be a woman and there is some\r\nsubtle inconceivable charm in completed womanhood  the reaction from her\r\nterrible fear and depression had come and her strong brilliant youth was\r\nmanifesting itself  her step was springy and her eyes were bright and\r\nthe glow of fine health accentuated by the militant humour of the\r\npresent moment seemed to light up her beautiful skin  in herself she\r\nwas desirable very desirable leonard felt his pulses quicken and his\r\nblood leap as he looked at her  even his prejudice against her red hair\r\nhad changed to something like hungry admiration  leonard felt for the\r\nfirst moment since he had known her that she was a woman and that with\r\nrelation to her he was a man\r\n\r\nand at the moment all the man in him asserted itself  it was with half\r\nlove as he saw it and half selfassertion that he answered her\r\nquestion\r\n\r\nthe day you asked me to marry you  oh what a fool i was not to leap at\r\nsuch a chance  i should have taken you in my arms then and kissed you\r\ntill i showed you how much i loved you  but that will all come yet the\r\nkissing is still to come  oh  stephen dont you see that i love you\r\nwont you tell me that you love me still  darling  he almost sprang at\r\nher his arms extended to clasp her\r\n\r\nstop  her voice rang like a trumpet  she did not mean to submit to\r\nphysical violence and in the present state of her feeling an embrace\r\nfrom him would be a desecration  he was now odious to her she\r\npositively loathed him\r\n\r\nbefore her uplifted hand and those flashing eyes he stopped as one\r\nstricken into stone  in that instant she knew she was safe and with a\r\nwomans quickness of apprehension and resolve made up her mind what\r\ncourse to pursue  in a calm voice she said quietly\r\n\r\nmr everard you have followed me in secret and without my permission\r\ni cannot talk here with you alone  i absolutely refuse to do so now or\r\nat any other time  if you have anything especial to say to me you will\r\nfind me at home at noon tomorrow  remember i do not ask you to come  i\r\nsimply yield to the pressure of your importunity  and remember also that\r\ni do not authorise you in any way to resume this conversation  in fact\r\ni forbid it  if you come to my house you must control yourself to my\r\nwish\r\n\r\nthen with a stately bow whose imperious distance inflamed him more than\r\never and without once looking back she took her way home all agitated\r\ninwardly and with fast beating heart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxiifixing the bounds\r\n\r\n\r\nleonard came towards normanstand next forenoon in considerable mental\r\ndisturbance  in the first place he was seriously in love with stephen\r\nand love is in itself a disturbing influence\r\n\r\nleonards love was all of the flesh and as such had power at present to\r\ndisturb him as it would later have power to torture him  again he was\r\ndisturbed by the fear of losing stephen or rather of not being able to\r\ngain her  at first ever since she had left him on the path from the\r\nhilltop till his interview the next day he had looked on her possession\r\nas an option to the acceptance of which circumstances seemed to be\r\ncompelling him  but ever since that asset seemed to have been\r\ndwindling and now he was almost beginning to despair  he was altogether\r\ncold at heart and yet highly strung with apprehension as he was shown\r\ninto the blue drawingroom\r\n\r\nstephen came in alone closing the door behind her  she shook hands with\r\nhim and sat down by a writingtable near the window pointing to him to\r\nsit on an ottoman a little distance away  the moment he sat down he\r\nrealised that he was at a disadvantage he was not close to her and he\r\ncould not get closer without manifesting his intention of so doing  he\r\nwanted to be closer both for the purpose of his suit and for his own\r\npleasure the proximity of stephen began to multiply his love for her  he\r\nthought that today she looked better than ever of a warm radiant beauty\r\nwhich touched his senses with unattainable desire  she could not but\r\nnotice the passion in his eyes and instinctively her eyes wandered to a\r\nsilver gong placed on the table well within reach  the more he glowed\r\nthe more icily calm she sat till the silence between them began to grow\r\noppressive  she waited determined that he should be the first to speak\r\nrecognising the helplessness of silence he began huskily\r\n\r\ni came here today in the hope that you would listen to me  her\r\nanswer given with a conventional smile was not helpful\r\n\r\ni am listening\r\n\r\ni cannot tell you how sorry i am that i did not accept your offer  if i\r\nhad know when i was coming that day that you loved me      she\r\ninterrupted him calm of voice and with uplifted hand\r\n\r\ni never said so did i  surely i could not have said such a thing  i\r\ncertainly dont remember it  leonard was puzzled\r\n\r\nyou certainly made me think so  you asked me to marry you didnt you\r\nher answer came calmly though in a low voice\r\n\r\ni did\r\n\r\nthen if you didnt love me why did you ask me to marry you  it was\r\nhis nature to be more or less satisfied when he had put any one opposed\r\nto him proportionally in the wrong and now his exultation at having put\r\na poser manifested itself in his tone  this however braced up stephen\r\nto cope with a difficult and painful situation  it was with a calm\r\nseemingly genial frankness that she answered smilingly\r\n\r\ndo you know that is what has been puzzling me from that moment to\r\nthis  her words appeared to almost stupefy leonard  this view of the\r\nmatter had not occurred to him and now the puzzle of it made him angry\r\n\r\ndo you mean to say he asked hotly that you asked a man to marry you\r\nwhen you didnt even love him\r\n\r\nthat is exactly what i do mean  why i did it is i assure you as much\r\na puzzle to me as it is to you  i have come to the conclusion that it\r\nmust have been from my vanity  i suppose i wanted to dominate somebody\r\nand you were the weakest within range\r\n\r\nthank you  he was genuinely angry by this time and but for a\r\nwholesome fear of the consequences would have used strong language\r\n\r\ni dont see that i was the weakest about  somehow this set her on her\r\nguard  she wanted to know more so she asked\r\n\r\nwho else\r\n\r\nharold an wolf  you had him on a string already  the name came like a\r\nsword through her heart but the bitter comment braced her to further\r\ncaution  her voice seemed to her to sound as though far away\r\n\r\nindeed  and may i ask you how you came to know that  her voice seemed\r\nso cold and sneering to him that he lost his temper still further\r\n\r\nsimply because he told me so himself  it pleased him to do in ill turn\r\nto harold  he did not forget that savage clutch at his throat and he\r\nnever would  stephens senses were all alert  she saw an opportunity of\r\nlearning something and went on with the same cold voice\r\n\r\nand i suppose it was that pleasing confidence which was the cause of\r\nyour refusal of my offer of marriage of which circumstance you have so\r\nthoughtfully and so courteously reminded me  this somehow seemed of\r\ngood import to leonard  if he could show her that his intention to marry\r\nher was antecedent to harolds confidence she might still go back to her\r\nold affection for him  he could not believe that it did not still exist\r\nhis experience of other women showed him that their love outlived their\r\nanger whether the same had been hot or cold\r\n\r\nit had nothing in the world to do with it  he never said a word about\r\nit till he threatened to kill methe great brute  this was learning\r\nsomething indeed  she went on in the same voice\r\n\r\nand may i ask you what was the cause of such sanguinary intention\r\n\r\nbecause he knew that i was going to marry you  as he spoke he felt\r\nthat he had betrayed himself he went on hastily hoping that it might\r\nescape notice\r\n\r\nbecause he knew that i loved you  oh stephen dont you know it now\r\ncant you see that i love you and that i want you for my wife\r\n\r\nbut did he threaten to kill you out of mere jealousy  do you still go\r\nin fear of your life  will it be necessary to arrest him  leonard was\r\nchagrined at her ignoring of his lovesuit and in his selfengrossment\r\nanswered sulkily\r\n\r\nim not afraid of him  and besides i believe he has bolted  i called\r\nat his house yesterday and his servant said they hadnt heard a word\r\nfrom him  stephens heart sank lower and lower  this was what she had\r\ndreaded  she said in as steady a voice as she could muster\r\n\r\nbolted  has he gone altogether\r\n\r\noh hell come back all right in time  hes not going to give up the\r\njolly good living he has here\r\n\r\nbut why has he bolted  when he threatened to kill you did he give any\r\nreason  there was too much talk about harold  it made him angry so he\r\nanswered in an offhand way\r\n\r\noh i dont know  and moreover i dont care\r\n\r\nand now said stephen having ascertained what she wanted to know\r\nwhat is it that you want to speak to me about\r\n\r\nher words fell on leonard like a cold douche  here had he been talking\r\nabout his love for her and yet she ignored the whole thing and asked\r\nhim what he wanted to talk about\r\n\r\nwhat a queer girl you are  you dont seem to attend to what a fellow is\r\nsaying  here have i been telling you that i love you and asking you to\r\nmarry me and yet you dont seem to have even heard me  she answered at\r\nonce quite sweetly and with a smile of superiority which maddened him\r\n\r\nbut that subject is barred\r\n\r\nhow do you mean  barred\r\n\r\nyes  i told you yesterday\r\n\r\nbut stephen he cried out quickly all the alarm in him and all the\r\nearnestness of which he was capable uniting to his strengthening cant\r\nyou understand that i love you with all my heart  you are so beautiful\r\nso beautiful  he felt now in reality what he was saying\r\n\r\nthe torrent of his words left no opening for her objection it swept all\r\nmerely verbal obstacles before it  she listened content in a measure\r\nso long as he sat at the distance which she had arranged before his\r\ncoming she did not fear any personal violence  moreover it was a\r\nsatisfaction to her now to hear him who had refused her pleading in\r\nvain  the more sincere his eloquence the larger her satisfaction she\r\nhad no pity for him now\r\n\r\ni know i was a fool stephen  i had my chance that day on the hilltop\r\nand if i had felt then as i feel now as i have felt every moment since\r\ni would not have been so cold  i would have taken you in my arms and\r\nheld you close and kissed you again and again and again  oh darling\r\ni love you  i love you  i love you  he held out his arms imploringly\r\nwont you love me  wont\r\n\r\nhe stopped paralysed with angry amazement  she was laughing\r\n\r\nhe grew purple in the face his hands were still outstretched  the few\r\nseconds seemed like hours\r\n\r\nforgive me she said in a polite tone suddenly growing grave  but\r\nreally you looked so funny sitting there so quietly and speaking in\r\nsuch a way that i couldnt help it  you really must forgive me  but\r\nremember i told you the subject was barred and as knowing that you\r\nwent on you really have no one but yourself to blame  leonard was\r\nfurious but managed to say as he dropped his arms\r\n\r\nbut i love you\r\n\r\nthat may be now she went on icily  but it is too late  i do not\r\nlove you and i have never loved you  of course had you accepted my\r\noffer of marriage you should never have known that  no matter how great\r\nhad been my shame and humiliation when i had come to a sense of what i\r\nhad done i should have honourably kept my part of the tacit compact\r\nentered into when i made that terrible mistake  i cannot tell you how\r\nrejoiced and thankful i am that you took my mistake in such a way  of\r\ncourse i do not give you any credit for it you thought only of\r\nyourself and did that which you liked best\r\n\r\nthat is a nice sort of thing to tell a man he interrupted with cynical\r\nfrankness\r\n\r\noh i do not want to hurt you unnecessarily but i wish there to be no\r\npossible misconception in the matter  now that i have discovered my\r\nerror i am not likely to fall into it again and that you may not have\r\nany error at all i tell you now again that i have not loved you do not\r\nlove you and never will and never can love you  here an idea struck\r\nleonard and he blurted out\r\n\r\nbut do you not think that something is due to me\r\n\r\nhow do you mean  her brows were puckered with real wonder this time\r\n\r\nfor false hopes raised in my mind  if i did not love you before the\r\nvery act of proposing to me has made me love you and now i love you so\r\nwell that i cannot live without you  in his genuine agitation he was\r\nstarting up when the sight of her hand laid upon the gong arrested him\r\nshe laughed as she said\r\n\r\ni thought that the privilege of changing ones mind was a female\r\nprerogative  besides i have done already something to make reparation\r\nto you for the wrong of    ofi may put it fairly as the suggestion\r\nis your ownof not having treated you as a woman\r\n\r\ndamn\r\n\r\nas you observe so gracefully it is annoying to have ones own silly\r\nwords come back at one boomerang fashion  i made up my mind to do\r\nsomething for you to pay off your debts  this so exasperated him that\r\nhe said out brutally\r\n\r\nno thanks to you for that  as i had to put up with the patronage and\r\nthe lecturings and the eyeglass of that infernal old woman i dont\r\nintend    \r\n\r\nstephen stood up her hand upon the gong\r\n\r\nmr everard if you do not remember that you are in my drawingroom and\r\nspeaking of my dear and respected aunt i shall not detain you longer\r\n\r\nhe sat down at once saying surlily\r\n\r\ni beg your pardon  i forgot  you make me so wild thatthat      he\r\nchewed the ends of his moustache angrily  she resumed her seat taking\r\nher hand from the gong  without further pause she continued\r\n\r\nquite right  it has been miss rowly who paid your debts  at first i\r\nhad promised myself the pleasure but from something in your speech and\r\nmanner she thought it better that such an act should not be done by a\r\nwoman in my position to a man in yours  it might if made public have\r\ncreated quite a wrong impression in the minds of many of our friends\r\n\r\nthere was something like a snort from leonard  she ignored it\r\n\r\nso she paid the money herself out of her own fortune  and indeed i\r\nmust say that you do not seem to have treated her with much gratitude\r\n\r\nwhat did i say or do that put you off doing the thing yourself\r\n\r\ni shall answer it frankly it was because you manifested several times\r\nin a manner there was no mistaking both by words and deeds an intention\r\nof levying blackmail on me by using your knowledge of my ridiculous\r\nunmaidenly act  no one can despise or deplore or condemn that act more\r\nthan i do so that rather than yield a single point to you i am if\r\nnecessary ready to face the odium which the public knowledge of it might\r\nproduce  what i had intended to do for you in the way of compensation\r\nfor false hopes raised to you by that act has now been done  that it was\r\ndone by my aunt on my behalf and not by me matters to you no more than\r\nit did to your creditors who when they received the money made no\r\ncomplaint of injury to their feelings on that account\r\n\r\nnow when you think the whole matter over in quietness you will\r\nknowing that i am ready at any time to face if necessary the unpleasant\r\npublicity be able to estimate what damage you would do to yourself by\r\nany expose  it seems to me that you would come out of it pretty badly\r\nall round  that however is not my affair it entirely rests with\r\nyourself  i think i know how women would regard it  i dare say you best\r\nknow how men would look at it and at you\r\n\r\nleonard knew already how the only man who knew of it had taken it and\r\nthe knowledge did not reassure him\r\n\r\nyou jade  you infernal devilish cruel smoothtongued jade  he\r\nstood as bespoke  she stood too and stood watching him with her hand on\r\nthe gong  after a pause of a couple of seconds she said gravely\r\n\r\none other thing i should wish to say and i mean it  understand me\r\nclearly that i mean it  you must not come again into my grounds without\r\nmy special permission  i shall not allow my liberty to be taken away or\r\nrestricted by you  if there be need at any time to come to the house\r\ncome in ceremonious fashion by the avenues which are used by others  you\r\ncan always speak to me in public or socially in the most friendly\r\nmanner as i shall hope to be able to speak to you  but you must never\r\ntransgress the ordinary rules of decorum  if you do i shall have to\r\ntake for my own protection another course  i know you now  i am\r\nwilling to blot out the past but it must be the whole past that is wiped\r\nout\r\n\r\nshe stood facing him and as he looked at her clearcut aquiline face\r\nher steady eyes her resolute mouth her carriage masterly in its self\r\npossessed poise he saw that there was no further hope for him  there\r\nwas no love and no fear\r\n\r\nyou devil he hissed\r\n\r\nshe struck the gong her aunt entered the room\r\n\r\noh is that you auntie  mr everard has finished his business with\r\nme  then to the servant who had entered after miss rowly\r\n\r\nmr everard would like his carriage  by the way she added turning to\r\nhim in a friendly way as an afterthought will you not stay mr\r\neverard and take lunch with us  my aunt has been rather moping lately\r\ni am sure your presence would cheer her up\r\n\r\nyes do stay mr everard added miss rowly placidly  it would make a\r\npleasant hour for us all\r\n\r\nleonard with a great effort said with conventional politeness\r\n\r\nthanks awfully  but i promised my father to be home for lunch and he\r\nwithdrew to the door which the servant held open\r\n\r\nhe went out filled with anger and despair and sad for him with a\r\nfierce overmastering desirelove he called itfor the clever proud\r\nimperious beauty who had so outmatched and crushed him\r\n\r\nthat beautiful red head which he had at first so despised was\r\nhenceforth to blaze in his dreams\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxiiithe man\r\n\r\n\r\non the scoriac harold an wolf now john robinson kept aloof from every\r\none  he did not make any acquaintances did not try to  some of those\r\nat table with him being ladies and gentlemen now and again made a\r\npolite remark to which he answered with equal politeness  being what he\r\nwas he could not willingly offend any one and there was nothing in his\r\nmanner to repel any kindly overture to acquaintance  but this was the\r\nfull length his acquaintanceship went so he gradually felt himself\r\npractically alone  this was just what he wished he sat all day silent\r\nand alone or else walked up and down the great deck that ran from stem\r\nto stern still always alone  as there were no secondclass or steerage\r\npassengers on the scoriac there were no deck restraints and so there\r\nwas ample room for individual solitude  the travellers however were a\r\nsociable lot and a general feeling of friendliness was abroad  the\r\nfirst four days of the journey were ideally fine and life was a joy  the\r\ngreat ship with bilge keels was as steady as a rock\r\n\r\namong the other passengers was an american family consisting of andrew\r\nstonehouse the great ironmaster and contractor with his wife and little\r\ndaughter\r\n\r\nstonehouse was a remarkable man in his way a typical product of the\r\nanglosaxon under american conditions  he had started in young manhood\r\nwith nothing but a good education due in chief to his own industry and\r\nhis having taken advantage to the full of such opportunities as life had\r\nafforded to him  by unremitting work he had at thirty achieved a great\r\nfortune which had however been up to then entirely invested and\r\ninvolved in his businesses  with however the colossal plant at his\r\ndisposal and by aid of the fine character he had won for honesty and\r\ngood work he was able within the next ten years to pile up a fortune\r\nvast even in a nation where multimillionaires are scattered freely  then\r\nhe had married wisely and happily  but no child had come to crown the\r\nhappiness of the pair who so loved each other till a good many years had\r\ncome and gone  then when the hope of issue had almost passed away a\r\nlittle daughter came  naturally the child was idolised by her parents\r\nand thereafter every step taken by either was with an eye to her good\r\nwhen the rigour of winter and the heat of summer told on the child in a\r\nway which the more hardy parents had never felt she was whirled away to\r\nsome place with more promising conditions of health and happiness  when\r\nthe doctors hinted that an ocean voyage and a winter in italy would be\r\ngood those too were duly undertaken  and now the child being in\r\nperfect health the family was returning before the weather should get\r\ntoo hot to spend the summer at their chalet amongst the great pines on\r\nthe slopes of mount ranier  like the others on board mr and mrs\r\nstonehouse had proffered travellers civilities to the sad lonely young\r\nman  as to the others he had shown thanks for their gracious courtesy\r\nbut friendship as in other cases did not advance  the stonehouses were\r\nnot in any way chagrined their lives were too happy and too full for\r\nthem to take needless offence  they respected the young mans manifest\r\ndesire for privacy and there so far as they were concerned the matter\r\nrested\r\n\r\nbut this did not suit the child  pearl was a sweet little thing a real\r\nblueeyed goldenhaired little fairy full of lovingkindness  all the\r\nmotherinstinct in her and even at six a womanchild can be a\r\nmothertheoretically went out towards the huge lonely sad silent\r\nyoung man  she insisted on friendship with him insisted shamelessly\r\nwith the natural inclination of innocence which rises high above shame\r\neven the halfhearted protests of the mother who loved to see the child\r\nhappy did not deter her after the second occasion of pearls seeking\r\nhim as she persisted harold could but remonstrate with the mother in\r\nturn the ease of the gentle lady and the happiness of her child were\r\nmore or less at stake  when mrs stonehouse would say\r\n\r\nthere darling  you must be careful not to annoy the gentleman pearl\r\nwould turn a rosy allcommanding face to her and answer\r\n\r\nbut mother i want him to play with me  you must play with me  then\r\nas the mother would look at him he would say quickly and with genuine\r\nheartiness too\r\n\r\noh please madam do let her play with me  come pearl shall you ride\r\na cockhorse or go to market the way the gentleman rides  then the\r\nchild would spring on his knee with a cry of delight and their games\r\nbegan\r\n\r\nthe presence of the child and her loving ways were unutterably sweet to\r\nharold but his pleasure was always followed by a pain that rent him as\r\nhe thought of that other little one now so far away and of those times\r\nthat seemed so long since gone\r\n\r\nbut the child never relaxed in her efforts to please and in the long\r\nhours of the sea voyage the friendship between her and the man grew and\r\ngrew  he was the biggest and strongest and therefore most lovely thing\r\non board the ship and that sufficed her  as for him the child\r\nmanifestly loved and trusted him and that was allinall to his weary\r\ndesolate heart\r\n\r\nthe fifth day out the weather began to change the waves grew more and\r\nmore mountainous as the day wore on and the ship advanced west  not even\r\nthe great bulk and weight of the ship which ordinarily drove through the\r\nseas without pitch or roll were proof against waves so gigantic  then\r\nthe wind grew fiercer and fiercer coming in roaring squalls from the\r\nsouthwest  most of those on board were alarmed for the great waves\r\nwere dreadful to see and the sound of the wind was a trumpetcall to\r\nfear\r\n\r\nthe sick stayed in their cabins the rest found an interest if not a\r\npleasure on deck  among the latter were the stonehouses who were old\r\ntravellers  even pearl had already had more seavoyages than fall to\r\nmost people in their lives  as for harold the storm seemed to come\r\nquite naturally to him and he paced the deck like a shipmaster\r\n\r\nit was fortunate for the passengers that most of them had at this period\r\nof the voyage got their sea legs otherwise walking on the slippery deck\r\nthat seemed to heave as the rolling of the vessel threw its slopes up or\r\ndown would have been impossible  pearl was like most children pretty\r\nsurefooted holding fast to harolds hand she managed to move about\r\nceaselessly  she absolutely refused to go with any one else  when her\r\nmother said that she had better sit still she answered\r\n\r\nbut mother i am quite safe with the man  the man was the name she\r\nhad given harold and by which she always now spoke of him  they had had\r\na good many turns together and harold had with the captains\r\npermission taken her up on the bridge and showed her how to look out\r\nover the dodger without the wind hurting her eyes  then came the\r\nwelcome beeftea hour and all who had come on deck were cheered and\r\nwarmed with the hot soup  pearl went below and harold in the shelter\r\nof the charthouse together with a good many others looked out over the\r\nwild sea\r\n\r\nharold despite the wild turmoil of winds and seas around him which\r\nusually lifted his spirits was sad feeling lonely and wretched he was\r\nsuffering from the recoil of his little friends charming presence  pearl\r\ncame on deck again looking for him  he did not see her and the child\r\nseeing an opening for a new game avoided both her father and mother who\r\nalso stood in the shelter of the charthouse and ran round behind it on\r\nthe weather side calling a loud boo to attract harolds attention as\r\nshe ran\r\n\r\na few seconds later the scoriac put her nose into a coming wave at just\r\nthe angle which makes for the full exercise of the opposing forces  the\r\ngreat wave seemed to strike the ship on the port quarter like a giant\r\nhammer and for an instant she stood still trembling  then the top of\r\nthe wave seemed to leap up and deluge her  the wind took the flying\r\nwater and threw it high in volumes of broken spray which swept not only\r\nthe deck but the rigging as high as the top of the funnels  the child\r\nsaw the mass of water coming and shrieking flew round the port side of\r\nthe charthouse  but just as she turned down the open space between it\r\nand the funnel the vessel rolled to starboard  at the same moment came a\r\npuff of wind of greater violence than ever  the child calling out half\r\nin simulated half in real fear flew down the slope  as she did so the\r\ngale took her and in an instant whirled her almost touching her mother\r\nover the rail into the sea\r\n\r\nmrs stonehouse shrieked and sprang forward as though to follow her\r\nchild  she was held back by the strong arm of her husband  they both\r\nslipped on the sloping deck and fell together into the scuppers  there\r\nwas a chorus of screams from all the women present  harold with an\r\ninstinctive understanding of the dangers yet to be encountered seized a\r\nred tamoshanter from the head of a young girl who stood near\r\n\r\nher exclamation of surprise was drowned in the fearful cry man\r\noverboard and all rushed down to the rail and saw harold as he emerged\r\nfrom the water pull the red cap over his head and then swim desperately\r\ntowards the child whose golden hair was spread on the rising wave\r\n\r\nthe instant after pearls being swept overboard might be seen the\r\nsplendid discipline of a wellordered ship  every man to his post and\r\nevery man with a knowledge of his duty  the first officer called to the\r\nquartermaster at the wheel in a voice which cut through the gale like a\r\ntrumpet\r\n\r\nhard a port  hard\r\n\r\nthe stern of the great ship swung away to port in time to clear the\r\nfloating child from the whirling screw which would have cut her to\r\npieces in an instant  then the officer after tearing the engineroom\r\nsignal to starboard engine full speed astern ran for the lifebuoy\r\nhanging at the starboard end of the bridge  this he hurled far into the\r\nsea  as it fell the attached rope dragged with it the signal which so\r\nsoon as it reaches water bursts into smoke and flamesignal by day and\r\nnight  this done and it had all been done in a couple of seconds he\r\nworked the electric switch of the syren which screamed out quickly once\r\ntwice thrice  this is the dread sound which means man overboard and\r\ndraws to his post every man on the ship waking or sleeping\r\n\r\nthe captain was now on the bridge and in command and the first officer\r\nfreed from his duty there ran to the emergency boat swung out on its\r\ndavits on the port side\r\n\r\nall this time though only numbered by seconds the scoriac was turning\r\nhard to starboard making a great figure of eight for it is quicker to\r\nturn one of these great sea monsters round than to stop her in mid\r\ncareer  the aim of her captain in such cases is to bring her back to the\r\nweather side of the floating buoy before launching the boat\r\n\r\non deck the anguish of the childs parents was pitiable  close to the\r\nrail with her husbands arms holding her tight to it the distressed\r\nmother leaned out but always moving so that she was at the nearest point\r\nof the ship to her child  as the ship passed on it became more difficult\r\nto see the heads  in the greater distance they seemed to be quite close\r\ntogether  all at once just as a great wave which had hidden them in the\r\nfarther trough passed on the mother screamed out\r\n\r\nshes sinking shes sinking  oh god  oh god and she fell on her\r\nknees her horrified eyes set in a face of ashen grey looking out\r\nbetween the rails\r\n\r\nbut at the instant all eyes saw the mans figure rise in the water as he\r\nbegan to dive  there was a hush which seemed deadly the onlookers\r\nfeared to draw breath  and then the mothers heart leaped and her cry\r\nrang out again as two heads rose together in the waste of sea\r\n\r\nhe has her  he has her  he has her  oh thank god  thank god and\r\nfor a single instant she hid her face in her hands\r\n\r\nthen when the fierce hurrah of all on board had been hushed in\r\nexpectation the comments broke forth  most of the passengers had by\r\nthis time got glasses of one kind or another\r\n\r\nsee  hes putting the cap on the childs head  hes a cool one that\r\nfancy him thinking of a red cap at such a time\r\n\r\nay we could see that cap when it might be we couldnt see anything\r\nelse\r\n\r\nlook this from an old sailor standing by his boat how hes raisin\r\nin the water  hes keeping his body between her an the spindrift till\r\nthe squall has passed  that would choke them both in a wind like this if\r\nhe didnt know how to guard against it  hes all right he is  the\r\nlittle maid is safe wi him\r\n\r\noh bless you  bless you for those words said the mother turning\r\ntowards him  at this moment the second officer who had run down from\r\nthe bridge touched mr stonehouse on the shoulder\r\n\r\nthe captain asked me to tell you sir that you and mrs stonehouse had\r\nbetter come to him on the bridge  youll see better from there\r\n\r\nthey both hurried up and the mother again peered out with fixed eyes\r\nthe captain tried to comfort her laying his strong hand on her shoulder\r\nhe said\r\n\r\nthere there  take comfort maam  she is in the hands of god  all\r\nthat mortal man can do is being done  and she is safer with that gallant\r\nyoung giant than she could be with any other man on the ship  look how\r\nhe is protecting her  why he knows that all that can be done is being\r\ndone  he is waiting for us to get to him and is saving himself for it\r\nany other man who didnt know so much about swimming as he does would try\r\nto reach the lifebuoy and would choke the two of them with the spindrift\r\nin the trying  mind how he took the red cap to help us see them  hes a\r\nfine lad that a gallant lad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxivfrom the deeps\r\n\r\n\r\npresently the captain handed mrs stonehouse a pair of binoculars  for\r\nan instant she looked through them then handed them back and continued\r\ngazing out to where the two heads appearedwhen they did appear on the\r\ncrest of the waves like pinheads  the captain said half to himself and\r\nhalf to the father\r\n\r\nmothers eyes  mothers eyes and the father understood\r\n\r\nas the ship swept back to the rescue her funnels sending out huge\r\nvolumes of smoke which the gale beat down on the sea to leeward the\r\nexcitement grew tenser and tenser  men dared hardly breathe women wept\r\nand clasped their hands convulsively as they prayed  in the emergency\r\nboat the men sat like statues their oars upright ready for instant use\r\nthe officer stood with the falls in his hand ready to lower away\r\n\r\nwhen opposite the lifebuoy and about a furlong from harold and pearl\r\nthe captain gave the signal stop and then a second later full speed\r\nastern\r\n\r\nready men  steady  as the coming wave slipping under the ship began\r\nto rise up her side the officer freed the falls and the boat sank softly\r\ninto the lifting sea\r\n\r\ninstantly the oars struck the water and as the men bent to them a cheer\r\nrang out\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nharold and pearl heard and the man turning his head for a moment saw\r\nthat the ship was close at hand gradually drifting down to the weather\r\nside of them  he raised the child in his arms saying\r\n\r\nnow pearl wave your hand to mother and say hurrah  the child fired\r\ninto fresh hope waved her tiny hand and cried hurrah  hurrah  the\r\nsound could not reach the mothers ears but she saw and her heart\r\nleaped  she too waved her hand but she uttered no sound  the sweet\r\nhigh voice of the child crept over the water to the ears of the men in\r\nthe boat and seemed to fire their arms with renewed strength\r\n\r\na few more strokes brought them close harold with a last effort raised\r\nthe child in his arms as the boat drove down on them  the boatswain\r\nleaning over the bow grabbed the child and with one sweep of his strong\r\narm took her into the boat  the bow oarsman caught harold by the wrist\r\nthe way of the boat took him for a moment under water but the next man\r\npulling his oar across the boat stooped over and caught him by the\r\ncollar and clung fast  a few seconds more and he was hauled abroad  a\r\nwild cheer from all on the scoriac came sweeping down on the wind\r\n\r\nwhen once the boats head had been turned towards the ship and the oars\r\nhad bent again to their work they came soon within shelter  when they\r\nhad got close enough ropes were thrown out caught and made fast and\r\nthen came down one of the bowlines which the seamen held ready along the\r\nrail of the lower deck  this was seized by the boatswain who placed it\r\nround him under his armpits  then standing with the child in his arms\r\nhe made ready to be pulled up  pearl held out her arms to harold crying\r\nin fear\r\n\r\nno no let the man take me  i want to go with the man  he said\r\nquietly so as not to frighten her\r\n\r\nno no dear  go with him  he can do this better than i can  so she\r\nclung quietly to the seaman holding her face pressed close against his\r\nshoulder  as the men above pulled at the rope keeping it as far as\r\npossible from the side of the vessel the boatswain fended himself off\r\nwith his feet  in a few seconds he was seized by eager hands and pulled\r\nover the rail tenderly holding and guarding the child all the while  in\r\nan instant she was in the arms of her mother who had thrown herself upon\r\nher knees and pressed her close to her loving heart  the child put her\r\nlittle arms around her neck and clung to her  then looking up and seeing\r\nthe grey pallor of her face which even her great joy could not in a\r\nmoment efface she stroked it and said\r\n\r\npoor mother  poor mother  and now i have made you all wet  then\r\nfeeling her fathers hand on her head she turned and leaped into his\r\narms where he held her close\r\n\r\nharold was the next to ascend  he came amid a regular tempest of cheers\r\nthe seamen joining with the passengers  the officers led by the captain\r\nwaving his cap from the bridge joined in the paean\r\n\r\nthe boat was cast loose  an instant after the engine bells tinkled\r\nfull speed ahead\r\n\r\nmrs stonehouse had no eyes but for her child except for one other  when\r\nharold leaped down from the rail she rushed at him all those around\r\ninstinctively making way for her  she flung her arms around him and\r\nkissed him and then before he could stop her sank to her knees at his\r\nfeet and taking his hand kissed it  harold was embarrassed beyond all\r\nthinking  he tried to take away his hand but she clung tight to it\r\n\r\nno no she cried  you saved my child\r\n\r\nharold was a gentleman and a kindly one  he said no word till she had\r\nrisen still holding his hand when he said quietly\r\n\r\nthere there  dont cry  i was only too happy to be of service  any\r\nother man on board would have done the same  i was the nearest and\r\ntherefore had to be first  that was all\r\n\r\nmr stonehouse came to him and said as he grasped harolds hand so hard\r\nthat his fingers ached\r\n\r\ni cannot thank you as i would  but you are a man and will understand\r\ngod be good to you as you have been good to my child and to her mother\r\nand myself  as he turned away pearl who had now been holding close to\r\nher mothers hand sprang to him holding up her arms  he raised her up\r\nand kissed her  then he placed her back in her mothers arms\r\n\r\nall at once she broke down as the recollection of danger swept back upon\r\nher  oh mother  mother she cried with a long low wail which\r\ntouched every one of her hearers to the hearts core\r\n\r\nthe hot blankets are all ready  come there is not a moment to be lost\r\nill be with you when i have seen the men attended to\r\n\r\nso the mother holding her in her arms and steadied by two seamen lest\r\nshe should slip on the wet and slippery deck took the child below\r\n\r\nharold was taken by another set of men who rubbed him down till he\r\nglowed and poured hot brandy and water into him till he had to almost\r\nuse force against the superabundance of their friendly ministrations\r\n\r\nfor the remainder of that day a sort of solemn gladness ruled on the\r\nscoriac  the stonehouse family remained in their suite content in\r\nglad thankfulness to be with pearl who lay well covered up on the sofa\r\nsleeping off the effects of the excitement and the immersion and the\r\nresult of the potation which the doctor had forced upon her  harold was\r\nsimply shy and objecting to the publicity which he felt to be his fate\r\nremained in his cabin till the trumpet had blown the dinner call\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxva little child shall lead\r\n\r\n\r\nafter dinner harold went back to his cabin locking himself in he lay\r\ndown on the sofa  the gloom of his great sorrow was heavy on him the\r\nreaction from the excitement of the morning had come\r\n\r\nhe was recalled to himself by a gentle tapping  unlocking and opening\r\nthe door he saw mr stonehouse who said with trouble in his voice\r\n\r\ni came to you on account of my little child  there he stopped with a\r\nbreak in his voice  harold with intent to set his mind at ease and to\r\nstave off further expressions of gratitude replied\r\n\r\noh pray dont say anything  i am only too glad that i was privileged\r\nto be of service  i only trust that the dear little girl is no worse for\r\nherher adventure\r\n\r\nthat is why i am here said the father quickly  my wife and i are\r\nloth to trouble you  but the poor little thing has worked herself into a\r\nparoxysm of fright and is calling for you  we have tried in vain to\r\ncomfort or reassure her  she will not be satisfied without you  she\r\nkeeps calling on the man to come and help her  i am loth to put you to\r\nfurther strain after all you have gone through today but if you would\r\ncome  harold was already in the passage as he spoke\r\n\r\nof course im coming  if i can in any way help it is both a pleasure\r\nand a duty to be with her  turning to the father he added\r\n\r\nshe is indeed a very sweet and good child  i shall never forget how she\r\nbore herself whilst we waited for aid to come\r\n\r\nyou must tell her mother and me all about it said the father much\r\nmoved\r\n\r\nwhen they came close to the stonehouses suite of rooms they heard\r\npearls voice rising with a pitiful note of fear\r\n\r\nwhere is the man  oh where is the man  why doesnt he come to me  he\r\ncan save me  i want to be with the man  when the door opened and she\r\nsaw him she gave shriek of delight and springing from the arms of her\r\nmother fairly leaped into harolds arms which were outstretched to\r\nreceive her  she clung to him and kissed him again and again rubbing\r\nher little hands all over his face as though to prove to herself that he\r\nwas real and not a dream  then with a sigh she laid her head on his\r\nbreast the reaction of sleep coming all at once to her  with a gesture\r\nof silence harold sat down holding the child in his arms  her mother\r\nlaid a thick shawl over and sat down close to harold  mr stonehouse\r\nstood quiet in the doorway with the childs nurse peering anxiously over\r\nhis shoulder\r\n\r\nafter a little while when he thought she was asleep harold rose and\r\nbegan to place her gently in the bunk  but the moment he did so she\r\nwaked with a scream  the fright in her eyes was terrible  she clung to\r\nhim moaning and crying out between her sobs\r\n\r\ndont leave me  dont leave me  dont leave me  harold was much\r\nmoved and held the little thing tight in his strong arms saying to her\r\n\r\nno darling  i shant leave you  look in my eyes dear and i will\r\npromise you and then you will be happy  wont you\r\n\r\nshe looked quickly up in his face  then she kissed him lovingly and\r\nrested her head but not sleepily this time on his breast said\r\n\r\nyes  im not afraid now  im going to stay with the man  presently\r\nmrs stonehouse who had been thinking of ways and means and of the\r\ncomfort of the strange man who had been so good to her child said\r\n\r\nyou will sleep with mother tonight darling  mr    the man she\r\nsaid this with an appealing look of apology to harold the man will stay\r\nby you till you are asleep      but she interrupted not fretfully or\r\nargumentatively but with a settled air of content\r\n\r\nno  im going to sleep with the man\r\n\r\nbut dear one the mother expostulated the man will want sleep too\r\n\r\nall right mother  he can sleep too  ill be very good and lie quite\r\nquiet but oh mother i cant sleep unless his arms are round me  im\r\nafraid if theyre not the sea will get me and she clung closer to\r\nharold tightening her arms round his neck\r\n\r\nyou will not mind asked mrs stonehouse timidly to harold and seeing\r\nacquiescence in his face added in a burst of tearful gratitude\r\n\r\noh you are good to her to us all\r\n\r\nhush harold said quietly  then he said to pearl in a cheerful matter\r\noffact way which carried conviction to the childs mind\r\n\r\nnow darling it is time for all good little girls to be asleep\r\nespecially when they have had anan interesting day  you wait here till\r\ni put my pyjamas on and then ill come back for you  and mother and\r\nfather shall come and see you nicely tucked in\r\n\r\ndont be long the child anxiously called after him as he hurried away\r\neven trust can have its doubts\r\n\r\nin a few minutes harold was back in pyjamas and slipper and a dressing\r\ngown  pearl already wrapped in a warm shawl by her mother held out her\r\narms to harold who lifted her\r\n\r\nthe stonehouses suite of rooms was close to the top of the companion\r\nway and as harolds stateroom was on the saloon deck the little\r\nprocession had much to the mans concern run the gauntlet of the thong\r\nof passengers whom the bad weather had kept indoors  when he came out of\r\nthe day cabin carrying the child there was a rush of all the women to\r\nmake much of the little girl  they were all very kind and no\r\ntroublesome their interest was natural enough and harold stopped whilst\r\nthey petted the little thing\r\n\r\nthe little procession followed  mr and mrs stonehouse coming next and\r\nlast the nurse who manifested a phase of the anxiety of a hen who sees\r\nher foster ducklings waddling toward a pond\r\n\r\nwhen harold was in his bunk the little maid was brought in\r\n\r\nwhen they had all gone and the cabin was dark save for the gleam from\r\nthe nightlight which the careful mother had placed out of sight in the\r\nbasin at the foot of the bunk harold lay a long time in a negative\r\nstate if such be possible in so far as thought was concerned\r\n\r\npresently he became conscious of a movement of the child his arms a\r\nshuddering movement and a sort of smothered groan  the little thing was\r\nliving over again in sleep the perils and fears of the day  instinctively\r\nshe put up her hands and felt the a round her  then with a sigh clasped\r\nher arms round his neck and with a peaceful look laid her head upon his\r\nbreast  even through the gates of sleep her instinct had recognised and\r\nrealised protection\r\n\r\nand then this trust of a little child brought back the man to his nobler\r\nself  once again came back to him that love which he had had and which\r\nhe knew now that he had never lost for the little child that he had seen\r\ngrow into full womanhood whose image must dwell in his heart of hearts\r\nfor evermore\r\n\r\nthe long nights sleep quite restored pearl  she woke fairly early and\r\nwithout any recurrence of fear  at first she lay still fearing she\r\nwould wake the man but finding that he was awakehe had not slept a\r\nwink all nightshe kissed him and then scrambled out of bed\r\n\r\nit was still early morning but early hours rule on shipland  harold\r\nrang for the steward and when the man came he told him to tell mr\r\nstonehouse that the child was awake  his delight when he found the child\r\nunfrightened looking out of the port was unbounded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxvia noble offer\r\n\r\n\r\nthat day harold passed in unutterable gloom  the reaction was strong on\r\nhim and all his woe his bitter remembrance of the past and his\r\ndesolation for the future were with him unceasingly\r\n\r\nin the dusk of the evening he wandered out to his favourite spot the\r\ncabletank on top of the aft wheelhouse  here he had been all alone and\r\nhis loneliness had the added advantage that from the isolated elevation\r\nhe could see if anyone approached  he had been out there during the day\r\nand the captain who had noticed his habit had had rigged up a canvas\r\ndodger on the rail on the weather side  when he sat down on the coiled\r\nhawsers in the tank he was both secluded and sheltered  in this peaceful\r\ncorner his thoughts ran freely and in sympathy with the turmoil of wind\r\nand wave\r\n\r\nhow unfair it all was  why had he been singled out for such misery  what\r\ngleam of hope or comfort was left to his miserable life since he had\r\nheard the words of stephen those dreadful words which had shattered in\r\nan instant all the cherished hopes of his life  too well he remembered\r\nthe tone and look of scorn with which the horrible truths had been\r\nconveyed to him  in his inmost soul he accepted them as truths\r\nstephens soul had framed them and stephens lips had sent them forth\r\n\r\nfrom his position behind the screen he did not see the approaching figure\r\nof mr stonehouse and was astonished when he saw his head rise above the\r\nedge of the tank as he climbed the straight jacobs ladder behind the\r\nwheelhouse  the elder man paused as he saw him and said in an apologetic\r\nway\r\n\r\nwill you forgive my intruding on your privacy  i wanted to speak to you\r\nalone and as i saw you come here a while ago i thought it would be a\r\ngood opportunity  harold was rising as he spoke\r\n\r\nby all means  this place is common property  but all the same i am\r\nhonoured in your seeking me  the poor fellow wished to be genial but\r\ndespite his efforts there was a strange formality in the expression of\r\nhis words  the elder man understood and said as he hurried forward and\r\nsank beside him\r\n\r\npray dont stir  why what a cosy corner this is  i dont believe at\r\nthis moment there is such peace in the ship\r\n\r\nonce again the bitterness of harolds heart broke out in sudden words\r\n\r\ni hope not  there is no soul on board to whom i could wish such evil\r\nthe old man said as he laid his hand softly on the others shoulder\r\n\r\ngod help you my poor boy if such pain is in your heart  mr\r\nstonehouse looked out at the sea at last turning his face to him again\r\nhe spoke\r\n\r\nif you feel that i intrude on you i earnestly ask you to forgive me but\r\ni think that the years between your age and mine as well as my feeling\r\ntowards the great obligation which i owe you will plead for excuse  there\r\nis something i would like to say to you sir but i suppose i must not\r\nwithout your permission  may i have it\r\n\r\nif you wish sir  i can at least hear it\r\n\r\nthe old man bowed and went on\r\n\r\ni could not but notice that you have some great grief bearing upon you\r\nand from one thing or anotheri can tell you the data if you wish me to\r\ndo soi have come to the conclusion that you are leaving your native\r\nland because of it  here harold wakened to amazement by the readiness\r\nwith which his secret had been divined said quickly rather as an\r\nexclamation than interrogation\r\n\r\nhow on earth did you know that  his companion taking it as a query\r\nanswered\r\n\r\nsir at your age and with your strength life should be a joy and yet\r\nyou are sad companionship should be a pleasure yet you prefer solitude\r\nthat you are brave and unselfish i know i have reason thank god to\r\nknow it  that you are kindly and tolerant is apparent from your bearing\r\nto my little child this morning as well as your goodness of last night\r\nthe remembrance of which her mother and i will bear to our graves and to\r\nme now  i have not lived all these years without having had trouble in\r\nmy own heart and although the happiness of late years has made it dim\r\nmy gratitude to you who are so sad brings it all back to me  he bowed\r\nand harold wishing to avoid speaking of his sorrow said\r\n\r\nyou are quite right so far as i have a sorrow and it is because of it i\r\nhave turned my back on home  let it rest at that  his companion bowed\r\ngravely and went on\r\n\r\ni take it that you are going to begin life afresh in the new country  in\r\nsuch case i have a proposition to make  i have a large business a\r\nbusiness so large that i am unable to manage it all myself  i was\r\nintending that when i arrived at home i would set about finding a\r\npartner  the man i want is not an ordinary man  he must have brains and\r\nstrength and daring  he paused  harold felt what was coming but\r\nrealised as he jumped at the conclusion that it would not do for him to\r\ntake for granted that he was the man sought  he waited mr stonehouse\r\nwent on\r\n\r\nas to brains i am prepared to take the existence of such on my own\r\njudgment  i have been reading men and in this aspect specially all my\r\nlife  the man i have thought of has brains  i am satisfied of that\r\nwithout proof  i have proof of the other qualities  he paused again\r\nas harold said nothing he continued in a manner ill at ease\r\n\r\nmy difficulty is to make the proposal to the man i want  it is so\r\ndifficult to talk business to a man to whom you under great obligation\r\nto whom you owe everything  he might take a friendly overture ill\r\nthere was but one thing to be said and harold said it  his heart warmed\r\nto the kindly old man and he wished to spare him pain even if he could\r\nnot accept him proposition\r\n\r\nhe couldnt take it ill unless he was an awful bounder\r\n\r\nit was you i thought of\r\n\r\ni thought so much sir said harold after a pause and i thank you\r\nearnestly and honestly  but it is impossible\r\n\r\noh my dear sir said the other chagrined as well as surprised  think\r\nagain  it is really worth your while to think of it no matter what your\r\nultimate decision may be\r\n\r\nharold shook his head  there was a long silence  the old man wished to\r\ngive his companion time to think and indeed he thought that harold was\r\nweighing the proposition in his mind  as for harold he was thinking how\r\nbest he could make his absolute refusal inoffensive  he must he felt\r\ngive some reason and his thoughts were bent on how much of the truth he\r\ncould safely give without endangering his secret  therefore he spoke at\r\nlast in general terms\r\n\r\ni can only ask you sir to bear with me and to believe that i am very\r\ntruly and sincerely grateful to you for your trust  but the fact is i\r\ncannot go anywhere amongst people  of course you understand that i am\r\nspeaking in confidence to you alone and to none other\r\n\r\nabsolutely said mr stonehouse gravely  harold went on\r\n\r\ni must be alone  i can only bear to see people on this ship because it\r\nis a necessary way to solitude\r\n\r\nyou cannot go anywhere amongst people  pardon me  i dont wish to be\r\nunduly inquisitive but on my word i fail to understand  harold was in\r\na great difficulty  common courtesy alone forbade that he should leave\r\nthe matter where it was and in addition both the magnificently generous\r\noffer which had been made to him and the way in which accident had\r\nthrown him to such close intimacy with pearls family required that he\r\nshould be at least fairly frank  at last in a sort of cold desperation\r\nhe said\r\n\r\ni cannot meet anyone    there it something that happened   \r\nsomething i did    nothing can make it right    all i can do is to\r\nlose myself in the wildest grimmest wilderness in the world and fight\r\nmy pain    my shame    \r\n\r\na long silence  then the old mans voice came clear and sweet something\r\nlike music in the shelter from the storm\r\n\r\nbut perhaps time may mend things  god is very good      harold\r\nanswered out of the bitterness of his heart  he felt that his words were\r\nladen with an anger which he did not feel but he did not see his way to\r\nalter them\r\n\r\nnothing can mend this thing  it is at the farthest point of evil and\r\nthere is no going on or coming back  nothing can wipe out what is done\r\nwhat is past\r\n\r\nagain silence and again the strong gentle voice\r\n\r\ngod can do much  oh my dear young friend you who have been such a\r\nfriend to me and mine think of this\r\n\r\ngod himself can do nothing here  it is done  and that is the end  he\r\nturned his head it was all he could do to keep from groaning  the old\r\nmans voice vibrated with earnest conviction as he spoke\r\n\r\nyou are young and strong and brave  your heart is noble  you can think\r\nquickly in moments of peril therefore your brain is sound and alert\r\nnow may i ask you a favour it is not much  only that you will listen\r\nwithout interruption to what if i have your permission i am going to\r\nsay  do not ask me anything do not deny do not interrupt  only\r\nlisten  may i ask this\r\n\r\nby all means  it is not much he almost felt like smiling as he spoke\r\nmr stonehouse after a short pause as if arranging his thoughts spoke\r\n\r\nlet me tell you what i am  i began life with nothing but a fair\r\neducation such as all our american boys get  but from a good mother i\r\ngot an idea that to be honest was the best of all things from a\r\nstrenuous father who however could not do well for himself i learned\r\napplication to work and how best to use and exercise such powers as were\r\nin me  from the start things prospered with me  men who knew me trusted\r\nme some came with offers to share in my enterprise  thus i had command\r\nof what capital i could use i was able to undertake great works and to\r\ncarry them through  fortune kept growing and growing for as i got\r\nwealthier i found newer and larger and more productive uses for my money\r\nand in all my work i can say before god i never willingly wronged any\r\nman  i am proud to be able to say that my name stands good wherever it\r\nhas been used  it may seem egotistical that i say such things of myself\r\nit may seem bad taste but i speak because i have a motive in so doing  i\r\nwant you to understand at the outset that in my own country wherever i\r\nam known and in my own work my name is a strength\r\n\r\nhe paused a while  harold sat still he knew that such man would not\r\ncould not speak in such a way without a strong motive and to learn that\r\nmotive he waited\r\n\r\nwhen you were in the water making what headway you could in that awful\r\nseawhen my little childs life hung in the balance and the anguish of\r\nmy wifes heart nearly tore my heart in two i said to myself if we had\r\na son i should wish him to be like that  i meant it then and i mean it\r\nnow  come to me as you are  faults and past and all  forget the\r\npast  whatever it was we will together try to wipe it out  much may be\r\ndone in restoring where there has been any wrongdoing  take my name as\r\nyour own  it will protect you from the result of what ever has been and\r\ngive you an opportunity to find your place again  you are not bad in\r\nheart i know  whatever you have done has not been from base motives  few\r\nof us are spotless as to facts  you and i will show ourselvesfor\r\nunless god wills to the opposite we shall confide in none otherthat a\r\nstrong brave man may win back all that was lost  let me call you by my\r\nname and hold you as the son of my heart and it will be a joy and\r\npleasure to my declining years\r\n\r\nas he had spoken harolds thoughts had at first followed in some\r\nwonderment  but gradually as his noble purpose unfolded based as it\r\nwas on a misconception as to the misdoing of which he himself had spoken\r\nhe had been almost stricken dumb  at the first realisation of what was\r\nintended he could not have spoken had he tried but at the end he had\r\nregained his thoughts and his voice  there was still wonderment in it\r\nas realising from the long pause that the old man had completed his\r\nsuggestion he spoke\r\n\r\nif i understand aright you are offering me your name  offering to share\r\nyour honour with me  with me whom if again i understand you take as\r\nhaving committed some crime\r\n\r\ni inferred from what you said and from your sadness your desire to shun\r\nyour kind that there was if not a crime some fault which needed\r\nexpiation\r\n\r\nbut your honour sir your honour  there was a proud look in the old\r\nmans eyes as he said quietly\r\n\r\nit was my desire is my desire to share with you what i have that is\r\nbest and that i take it is not the least valuable of my possessions\r\nsuch as they are  and why not  you have given to me all that makes life\r\nsweet without which it would be unbearable  that child who came to my\r\nwife and me when i was old and she had passed her youth is all in all to\r\nus both  had your strength and courage been for barter in the moments\r\nwhen my child was quivering between life and death i would have\r\ncheerfully purchased them with not half but all  sir i should have\r\ngiven my soul  i can say this now for gratitude is above all barter\r\nand surely it is allowed to a father to show gratitude for the life of\r\nhis child\r\n\r\nthis greathearted generosity touched harold to the quick  he could\r\nhardly speak for a few minutes  then instinctively grasping the old\r\nmans hand he said\r\n\r\nyou overwhelm me  such noble trust and generosity as you have shown me\r\ndemands a return of trust  but i must think  will you remain here and\r\nlet me return to you in a little while\r\n\r\nhe rose quickly and slipped down the iron ladder passing into the\r\ndarkness and the mist and the flying spray\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxviiages wisdom\r\n\r\n\r\nharold went to and fro on the deserted deck  all at once the course he\r\nhad to pursue opened out before him  he was aware that what the noble\r\nminded old man offered him was fortune great fortune in any part of the\r\nworld  he would have to be refused but the refusal should be gently\r\ndone  he believing that the other had done something very wrong had\r\nstill offered to share with him his name his honour  such confidence\r\ndemanded full confidence in return the unwritten laws which governed the\r\nmen amongst whom he had been brought up required it\r\n\r\nand the shape that confidence should take  he must first disabuse his\r\nnew friends mind of criminal or unworthy cause for his going away  for\r\nthe sake of his own name and that of his dead father that should be done\r\nthen he would have to suggest the real cause    he would in this have\r\nto trust mr stonehouses honour for secrecy  but he was worthy of\r\ntrust  he would of course give no name no clue but he would put\r\nthings generally in a way that he could understand\r\n\r\nwhen his mind was so far made up he wanted to finish the matter so he\r\nturned to the wheelhouse and climbed the ladder again  it was not till\r\nhe sat in the shelter by his companion that he became aware that he had\r\nbecome wet with the spray  the old man wishing to help him in his\r\nembarrassment said\r\n\r\nwell harold began at once the straightforward habit of his life stood\r\nto him now\r\n\r\nlet me say first sir what will i know give you pleasure  the old man\r\nextended his hand he had been hoping for acceptance and this seemed\r\nlike it  harold laid his hand on it for an instant only and then raised\r\nit as if to say wait\r\n\r\nyou have been so good to me so nobly generous in your wishes that i\r\nfeel i owe you a certain confidence  but as it concerns not myself alone\r\ni will ask that it be kept a secret between us two  not to be told to\r\nany other not even your wife\r\n\r\ni will hold your secret sacred  even from my wife the first secret i\r\nshall have ever kept from her\r\n\r\nfirst then let me say and this is what i know will rejoice you that\r\ni am not leaving home and country because of any crime i have committed\r\nnot from any offence against god or man or law  thank god i am free\r\nfrom such  i have always tried to live uprightly      here a burst\r\nof pain overcame him and with a dry sob he added and that is what\r\nmakes the terrible unfairness of it all\r\n\r\nthe old man laid a kindly hand on his shoulder and kept it there for a\r\nfew moments\r\n\r\nmy poor boy  my poor boy was all he said  harold shook himself as if\r\nto dislodge the bitter thoughts  mastering himself he went on\r\n\r\nthere was a lady with whom i was very much thrown in contact since we\r\nwere children  her father was my fathers friend  my friend too god\r\nknows for almost with his dying breath he gave sanction to my marrying\r\nhis daughter if it should ever be that she should care for me in that\r\nway  but he wished me to wait and till she was old enough to choose\r\nto leave her free  for she is several years younger than i am and i am\r\nnot very old yetexcept in heart  all this you understand was said in\r\nprivate to me none other knew it  none knew of it even till this moment\r\nwhen i tell you that such a thing has been  he paused the other said\r\n\r\nbelieve me that i value your confidence beyond all words  harold felt\r\nalready the good effects of being able to speak of his pentup trouble\r\nalready this freedom from the nightmare loneliness of his own thoughts\r\nseemed to be freeing his very soul\r\n\r\ni honestly kept to his wishes  before god i did  no man who loved a\r\nwoman honoured her worshipped her could have been more scrupulously\r\ncareful as to leaving her free  what it was to me to so hold myself no\r\none knows no one ever will know  for i loved her do love her with\r\nevery nerve and fibre of my heart  all our lives we had been friends\r\nand i believed we loved and trusted each other  but    but then there\r\ncame a day when i found by chance that a great trouble threatened her\r\nnot from anything wrong that she had done but from something perhaps\r\nfoolish harmlessly foolish except that she did not know      he\r\nstopped suddenly fearing he might have said overmuch of stephens side\r\nof the affair  when i came to her aid however meaning the best and\r\nas singleminded as a man can be she misunderstood my words my meaning\r\nmy very coming and she said things which cannot be unsaid  things   \r\nmatters were so fixed that i could not explain and i had to listen  she\r\nsaid things that i did not believe she could have said to me to anyone\r\nthings that i did not think she could have thought    i dare say she\r\nwas right in some ways  i suppose i bungled in my desire to be\r\nunselfish  what she said came to me in new lights upon what i had done\r\n   but anyhow her statements were such that i felt i could not should\r\nnot remain  my very presence must have been a trouble to her hereafter\r\nthere was nothing for it but to come away  there was no place for me  no\r\nhope for me  there is none on this side of the grave    for i love\r\nher still more than ever  i honour and worship her still and ever\r\nwill and ever must    i am content to forego my own happiness but i\r\nfeel there is a danger to her from what has been  that there is and must\r\nbe to her unhappiness even from the fact that it was i who was the object\r\nof her wrath and this adds to my woe  worst of all is    the thought\r\nand the memory that she should have done so she who    she    \r\n\r\nhe turned away overcome and hid his face in his hands  the old man sat\r\nstill he knew that at such a moment silence is the best form of\r\nsympathy  but his heart glowed the wisdom of his years told him that he\r\nhad heard as yet of no absolute bar to his friends ultimate happiness\r\n\r\ni am rejoiced my dear boy at what you tell me of your own conduct  it\r\nwould have made no difference to me had it been otherwise  but it would\r\nhave meant a harder and longer climb back to the place you should hold\r\nbut it really seems that nothing is so hopeless as you think  believe\r\nme my dear young friend who are now as a son to my heart that there\r\nwill be bright days for you yet      he paused a moment but\r\nmastering himself went on in a quiet voice\r\n\r\ni think you are wise to go away  in the solitudes and in danger things\r\nthat are little in reality will find their true perspective and things\r\nthat are worthy will appear in their constant majesty\r\n\r\nhe stood and laying once again his hand on the young mans shoulder\r\nsaid\r\n\r\ni recognise that ithat we for my wife and little girl would be at one\r\nwith me in my wish did they know of it must not keep you from your\r\npurpose of fighting out your trouble alone  every man as the scotch\r\nproverb says must dree his own weird  i shall not i must not ask\r\nyou for any promise but i trust that if ever you do come back you will\r\nmake us all glad by seeing you  and remember that what i said of myself\r\nand of all i haveallholds good so long as i shall live\r\n\r\nbefore harold could reply he had slipped down the ladder and was gone\r\n\r\nduring the rest of the voyage with the exception of one occasion he did\r\nnot allude to the subject again by word or implication and harold was\r\ngrateful to him for it\r\n\r\non the night before fire island should be sighted harold was in the bow\r\nof the great ship looking out with eyes in which gleamed no hope  to him\r\ncame through the darkness mr stonehouse  he heard the footsteps and\r\nknew them so with the instinct of courtesy knowing that his friend\r\nwould not intrude on his solitude without purpose he turned and met him\r\nwhen the american stood beside him he said studiously avoiding looking\r\nat his companion\r\n\r\nthis is the last night we shall be together and if i may there is one\r\nthing i would like to say to you\r\n\r\nsay all you like sir said harold as heartily as he could i am sure\r\nit is well meant and for that at any rate i shall be grateful to you\r\n\r\nyou will yet be grateful i think he answered gravely  when it comes\r\nback to you in loneliness and solitude you will i believe think it\r\nworth being grateful for  i dont mean that you will be grateful to me\r\nbut for the thing itself  i speak out of the wisdom of many years  at\r\nyour time of life the knowledge cannot come from observation  it may my\r\npoor boy come through pain and if what i think is correct you will even\r\nin due time be grateful to the pain which left such golden residuum  he\r\npaused and harold grew interested  there was something in the old mans\r\nmanner which presaged a truth he at least believed it  so the young\r\nman listened at first with his ears and as the other spoke his heart\r\nlistened too\r\n\r\nyoung men are apt to think somewhat wrongly of women they love and\r\nrespect  we are apt to think that such women are of a different clay\r\nfrom ourselves  nay that they are not compact of clay at all but of\r\nsome faultless flawless material which the almighty keeps for such fine\r\nwork  it is only in middle age that menexcept scamps who learn this\r\nbad side of knowledge youngrealise that women are human beings like\r\nthemselves  it may be you know that you may have misjudged this young\r\nlady  that you have not made sufficient allowance for her youth her\r\nnature even the circumstances under which she spoke  you have told me\r\nthat she was in some deep grief or trouble  may it not have been that\r\nthis in itself unnerved her distorted her views aroused her passion\r\ntill all within and around was tinged with the jaundice of her concern\r\nher humiliationwhatever it was that destroyed for the time that normal\r\nself which you had known so long  may it not have been that her\r\nbitterest memory even since may be of the speaking of these very words\r\nwhich sent you out into the wide world to hide yourself from men  i have\r\nthought waking and sleeping of your position ever since you honoured me\r\nwith your confidence and with every hour the conviction has strengthened\r\nin me that there is a way out of this situation which sends a man like\r\nyou into solitude with a heart hopeless and full of pain and which\r\nleaves her perhaps in greater pain for she has not like you the complete\r\nsense of innocence  but at present there is no way out but through time\r\nand thought  whatever may be her ideas or wishes she is powerless  she\r\ndoes not know your thoughts no matter how she may guess at them  she\r\ndoes not know where you are or how to reach you no matter how complete\r\nher penitence may be  and oh my dear young friend remember that you\r\nare a strong man and she is a woman  only a woman in her passion and\r\nher weakness after all  think this all over my poor boy  you will have\r\ntime and opportunity where you are going  god help you to judge wisely\r\nafter a pause of a few seconds he said abruptly good night and moved\r\nquickly away\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nwhen the time for parting came pearl was inconsolable  not knowing any\r\nreason why the man should not do as she wished she was persistent in her\r\npetitions to harold that he should come with her and to her father and\r\nmother that they should induce him to do so  mrs stonehouse would have\r\nwished him to join them if only for a time  her husband unable to give\r\nany hint without betraying confidence had to content himself with trying\r\nto appease his little daughter by vague hopes rather than promises that\r\nher friend would join them at some other time\r\n\r\nwhen the scoriac was warped at the pier there was a tendency on the\r\npart of the passengers to give harold a sort of public sendoff but\r\nbecoming aware of it he hurried down the gangway without waiting  having\r\nonly hand luggage for he was to get his equipment in new york he had\r\ncleared and passed the ring of customs officers before the most\r\nexpeditious of the other passengers had collected their baggage  he had\r\nsaid goodbye to the stonehouses in their own cabin  pearl had been so\r\nmuch affected at saying goodbye and his heart had so warmed to her\r\nthat at last he had said impulsively\r\n\r\ndont cry darling  if i am spared i shall come back to you within\r\nthree years  perhaps i will write before then but there are not many\r\npostoffices where i am going to\r\n\r\nchildren are easily satisfied  their trust makes a promise a real thing\r\nand its acceptance is the beginning of satisfaction  but for weeks after\r\nthe parting she had often fits of deep depression and at such times her\r\ntears always flowed  she took note of the date and there was never a\r\nday that she did not think of and sigh for the man\r\n\r\nand the man away in the wilds of alaska was feeling day by day and\r\nhour by hour the chastening and purifying influences of the wilderness\r\nhot passions cooled before the breath of the snowfield and the glacier\r\nthe moaning of a tortured spirit was lost in the roar of the avalanche\r\nand the scream of the cyclone  pale sorrow and cold despair were warmed\r\nand quickened by the fierce sunlight which came suddenly and stayed only\r\nlong enough to vitalise all nature\r\n\r\nand as the first step to understanding the man forgot himself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxviiide lannoy\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo years\r\n\r\nnot much to look back upon but a world to look forward to  to stephen\r\ndowered though she was with rare personal gifts and with wealth and\r\nposition accorded to but few the hours of waiting were longer than the\r\nyears that were past  yet the time had new and startling incidents for\r\nher  towards christmas in the second year the boer war had reached its\r\nclimax of evil  as the news of disaster after disaster was flashed\r\nthrough the cable she like others felt appalled at the sacrifices that\r\nwere being exacted by the god of war\r\n\r\none day she casually read in the times that the earl de lannoy had died\r\nin his london mansion and further learned that he had never recovered\r\nfrom the shock of hearing that his two sons and his nephew had been\r\nkilled  the paragraph concluded by his death the title passes to a\r\ndistant relative  the new lord de lannoy is at present in india with his\r\nregiment the th or grey hussars of which he is colonel  she gave\r\nthe matter a more than passing thought for it was sad to find a whole\r\nfamily thus wiped out at a blow\r\n\r\nearly in february she received a telegram from her london solicitor\r\nsaying that he wished to see her on an important matter  her answer was\r\ncome at once and at teatime mr copleston arrived  he was an old\r\nfriend and she greeted him warmly  she was a little chilled when he\r\nanswered with what seemed unusual deference\r\n\r\ni thank your ladyship for your kindness  she raised her eyebrows but\r\nmade no comment she was learning to be silent under surprise  when she\r\nhad handed the old gentleman his tea she said\r\n\r\nmy aunt has chosen to remain away thinking that you might wish to see\r\nme privately  but i take it that there is nothing which she may not\r\nshare  i have no secrets from her\r\n\r\nhe rubbed his hands genially as he replied\r\n\r\nnot at all not at all  i should like her to be present  it will i am\r\nsure be a delight to us all\r\n\r\nagain raised eyebrows again silence on the subject  when a servant\r\nanswered her bell she told him to ask miss rowly if she would kindly join\r\nthem\r\n\r\naunt laetitia and the solicitor were old cronies and their greeting was\r\nmost friendly  when the old gentlewoman had seated herself and taken her\r\ncup of tea mr copleston said to stephen with a sort of pomposity\r\n\r\ni have to announce your succession to the earldom de lannoy\r\n\r\nstephen sat quite still  she knew the news was true mr copleston was\r\nnot one who would jest on a business subject and too accurate a lawyer\r\nto make an error in a matter of fact  but the fact did not seem to touch\r\nher  it was not that she was indifferent to it few women could hear\r\nsuch news without a thrill  mr copleston seemed at a loss  miss rowly\r\nrose and quietly kissed her and saying simply god bless you my dear\r\nwent back to her seat\r\n\r\nrealising that mr copleston expected some acknowledgment stephen held\r\nout her hand to him and said quietly\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n\r\nafter a long pause she added quietly\r\n\r\nnow wont you tell us about it  i am in absolute ignorance and dont\r\nunderstand\r\n\r\ni had better not burden you at first with too many details which can\r\ncome later but give you a rough survey of the situation\r\n\r\nyour title of countess de lannoy comes to you through your ancestor\r\nisobel third and youngest daughter of the sixth earl messrs collinbrae\r\nand jackson knowing that my firm acted for your family communicated\r\nwith us  lest there should be any error we followed most carefully every\r\ndescendant and every branch of the family for we thought it best not to\r\ncommunicate with you till your right of inheritance was beyond dispute\r\nwe arrived independently at the same result as messrs collinbrae and\r\njackson  there is absolutely no doubt whatever of your claim  you will\r\npetition the crown and on reference to the house of lords the committee\r\nfor privileges will admit your right  may i offer my congratulations\r\nlady de lannoy on your acquisition  by the way i may say that all the\r\nestates of the earldom which have been from the first kept in strict\r\nentail go with the title de lannoy\r\n\r\nduring the recital stephen was conscious of a sort of bitter comment on\r\nthe tendencies of good fortune\r\n\r\ntoo late too late something seemed to whisper what delight it would\r\nhave been had father inherited    if harold had not gone      all\r\nthe natural joy seemed to vanish as bubbles break into empty air\r\n\r\nto aunt laetitia the new title was a source of pride and joy far greater\r\nthan would have been the case had it come to herself  she had for so\r\nmany years longed for new honours for stephen that she had almost come to\r\nregard them as a right whose coming should not be too long delayed  miss\r\nrowly had never been to lannoy and indeed she knew personally nothing\r\nof the county angleshire in which it was situated  she was naturally\r\nanxious to see the new domain but kept her feeling concealed during the\r\nmonths that elapsed until stephens right had been conceded by the\r\ncommittee for privileges  but after that her impatience became manifest\r\nto stephen who said one day in a teasing caressing way as was\r\nsometimes her wont\r\n\r\nwhy auntie what a hurry you are in  lannoy will keep wont it\r\n\r\noh my dear she replied shaking her head i can understand your own\r\nreticence for you dont want to seem greedy and in a hurry about your\r\nnew possessions  but when people come to my age theres no time to\r\nwaste  i feel i would not have complete material for happiness in the\r\nworldtocome if there were not a remembrance of my darling in her new\r\nhome\r\n\r\nstephen was much touched she said impulsively\r\n\r\nwe shall go tomorrow auntie  no  let us go today  you shall not\r\nwait an hour that i can help  she ran to the bell but before her hand\r\nwas on the cord the other said\r\n\r\nnot yet  stephen dear  it would flurry me to start all at once to\r\nmorrow will be time enough  and that will give you time to send word so\r\nthat they will be prepared for your coming\r\n\r\nhow often do we look for that tomorrow which never comes  how often do\r\nwe find that its lookedfor rosy tints are none other than the\r\ngloomladen grey of the present\r\n\r\nbefore the morrows sun was high in the heavens stephen was hurriedly\r\nsummoned to her aunts bedside  she lay calm and peaceful but one side\r\nof her face was alive and the other seemingly dead  in the night a\r\nparalytic stroke had seized her  the doctors said she might in time\r\nrecover a little but she would never be her old active self again  she\r\nherself with much painful effort managed to convey to stephen that she\r\nknew the end was near  stephen knowing the wish of her heart and\r\nthinking that it might do her good to gratify her wish asked if she\r\nshould arrange that she be brought to lannoy  feebly and slowly word by\r\nword she managed to convey her idea\r\n\r\nnot now dear one  i shall see it all in timesoon  and i shall\r\nunderstand and rejoice  for a long time she lay still holding with her\r\nright hand which was not paralysed the others hand  then she\r\nmurmured\r\n\r\nyou will find happiness there  she said no more but seemed to sleep\r\n\r\nfrom that sleep she never woke but faded slowly softly away\r\n\r\nstephen was brokenhearted  now indeed she felt alone and desolate\r\nall were gone  father uncle auntand  harold  the kingdoms of the\r\nearth which lay at her feet were of no account  one hour of the dead or\r\ndeparted any of them back again were worth them all\r\n\r\nnormanstand was now too utterly lonely to be endurable so stephen\r\ndetermined to go for a time at any rate to lannoy  she was becoming\r\naccustomed to be called my lady and your ladyship and the new\r\nloneness made her feel better prepared to take her place amongst new\r\nsurroundings\r\n\r\nin addition there was another spur to her going  leonard everard\r\nknowing of her absolute loneliness and feeling that in it was a\r\npossibility of renewing his old status was beginning to make himself\r\napparent  he had learned by experience a certain wisdom and did not put\r\nhimself forward obtrusively  but whenever they met he looked at her so\r\nmeekly and so lovingly that it brought remembrances which came with\r\nblushes  so all at once without giving time for the news to permeate\r\nthrough the neighbourhood she took her way to lannoy with a few\r\nservants\r\n\r\nstephens life had hitherto been spent inland  she had of course now and\r\nagain been for short periods to various places but the wonder of the sea\r\nas a constant companion had been practically unknown to her\r\n\r\nnow at her new home its full splendour burst upon her and so impressed\r\nitself upon her that new life seemed to open\r\n\r\nlannoy was on the northeastern coast the castle standing at the base of\r\na wide promontory stretching far into the north sea  from the coast the\r\nland sloped upward to a great rolling ridge  the outlook seaward was\r\nover a mighty expanse of green sward dotted here and there with woods\r\nand isolated clumps of trees which grew fewer and smaller as the rigour\r\nof the northern sea was borne upon them by the easterly gales\r\n\r\nthe coast was a wild and lonely one  no habitation other than an\r\nisolated fishers cottage was to be seen between the little fishingport\r\nat the northern curve away to the south where beyond a waste of\r\nsandhills and strand another tiny fishingvillage nestled under a high\r\ncliff sheltering it from northerly wind  for centuries the lords of\r\nlannoy had kept their magnificent prospect to themselves and though they\r\nhad treated their farmers and cottagers well none had ever been allowed\r\nto settle in the great park to seaward of the castle\r\n\r\nfrom the terrace of the castle only than one building other than the\r\ncottage on the headland could be seen  far off on the very crest of the\r\nridge was the tower of an old windmill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxixthe silver lady\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen it was known that lady de lannoy had come to lannoy there was a\r\nprompt rush of such callers as the county afforded  stephen however\r\ndid not wish to see anyone just at present  partly to avoid the chance\r\nmeeting with strangers and partly because she enjoyed and benefited by\r\nthe exercise she was much away from home every day  sometimes attended\r\nonly by a groom she rode long distances north or south along the coast\r\nor up over the ridge behind the castle and far inland along the shaded\r\nroads through the woods or over bleak windswept stretches of moorland\r\nsometimes she would walk all alone far down to the searoad and would\r\nsit for hours on the shore or high up on some little rocky headland where\r\nshe could enjoy the luxury of solitude\r\n\r\nnow and again in her journeyings she made friends most of them humble\r\nones  she was so great a lady in her station that she could be familiar\r\nwithout seeming to condescend  the fishermen of the little ports to\r\nnorth and south came to know her and to look gladly for her coming\r\ntheir goodwives had for her always a willing curtsy and a ready smile  as\r\nfor the children they looked on her with admiration and love tempered\r\nwith awe  she was so gentle with them so ready to share their pleasures\r\nand interests that after a while they came to regard her as some strange\r\nembodiment of fairydom and dreamland  many a little heart was made glad\r\nby the arrival of some item of delight from the castle and the hearts of\r\nthe sick seemed never to hope or their eyes to look in vain\r\n\r\none friend she made who became very dear and of great import  often she\r\nhad looked up at the old windmill on the crest of the ridge and wondered\r\nwho inhabited it for that some one lived in it or close by was shown\r\nat times by the drifting smoke  one day she made up her mind to go and\r\nsee for herself  she had a fancy not to ask anyone about it  the place\r\nwas a little item of mystery and as such to be treasured and exploited\r\nand in due course explored  the mill itself was picturesque and the\r\ndetail at closer acquaintance sustained the faroff impression  the\r\nroadway forked on the near side of the mill reuniting again the further\r\nside so that the place made a sort of islandmill outoffices and\r\ngarden  as the mill was on the very top of the ridge the garden which\r\nlay seawards was sheltered by the building from the west and from the\r\neast by a thick hedge of thorn and privet which quite hid it from the\r\nroadway  stephen took the lower road  finding no entrance save a locked\r\nwooden door she followed round to the western side where the business\r\nside of the mill had been  it was all still now and silent and that it\r\nhad long fallen into disuse was shown by the grey faded look of\r\neverything  grass green and luxuriant grew untrodden between the\r\ncobblestones with which the yard was paved  there was a sort of old\r\nworld quietude about everything which greatly appealed to stephen\r\n\r\nstephen dismounted and walked round the yard admiring everything  she\r\ndid not feel as if intruding for the gateway was wide open\r\n\r\na low door in the base of the mill tower opened and a maid appeared a\r\ndemure pretty little thing of sixteen or seventeen years dressed in a\r\nprim strait dress and an oldfashioned puritan cap  seeing a stranger\r\nshe made an ejaculation and drew back hastily  stephen called out to\r\nher\r\n\r\ndont be afraid little girl  will you kindly tell me who lives here\r\nthe answer came with some hesitation\r\n\r\nsister ruth\r\n\r\nand who is sister ruth  the question came instinctively and without\r\npremeditation  the maid embarrassed held hard to the halfopen door\r\nand shifted from foot to foot uneasily\r\n\r\ni dont know she said at last  only sister ruth i suppose  it was\r\nmanifest that the matter had never afforded her anything in the nature of\r\na problem  there was an embarrassing silence  stephen did not wish to\r\nseem or even to be prying but her curiosity was aroused  what manner\r\nof woman was this who lived so manifestly alone and who had but a\r\nchristian name  stephen however had all her life been accustomed to\r\ndominance and at normanstand and norwood had made many acquaintances\r\namongst her poorer neighbours  she was just about to ask if she might\r\nsee sister ruth when behind the maid in the dark of the low passageway\r\nappeared the tall slim figure of a silver woman  truly a silver woman\r\nthe first flash of stephens thought was correct  whitehaired white\r\nfaced whitecapped whitekerchiefed in a plaincut dress of lightgrey\r\nsilk without adornment of any kind  the whole ensemble was as a piece\r\nof old silver  the lines of her face were very dignified very sweet\r\nvery beautiful  stephen felt at once that she was in the presence of no\r\ncommon woman  she looked an admiration which all her quaker garments\r\ncould not forbid the other to feel  she was not the first to speak in\r\nsuch a noble presence the dignity of stephens youth imperatively\r\ndemanded silence if not humility  so she waited  the silver lady for\r\nso stephen ever after held her in her mind said quietly but with\r\nmanifest welcome\r\n\r\ndidst thou wish to see me  wilt thou come in  stephen answered\r\nfrankly\r\n\r\ni should like to come in if you will not think me rude  the fact is i\r\nwas struck when riding by with the beautiful situation of the mill  i\r\nthought it was only an old mill till i saw the garden hedges and i came\r\nround to ask if i might go in  the  silver lady came forward at a pace\r\nthat by itself expressed warmth as she said heartily\r\n\r\nindeed thou mayest  stay it is teatime  let us put thy horse in one\r\nof the sheds there is no man here at present to do it  then thou shalt\r\ncome with me and see my beautiful view  she was about to take the horse\r\nherself but stephen forestalled her with a quick no no pray let me\r\ni am quite accustomed  she led the horse to a shed and having looped\r\nthe rein over a hook patted him and ran back  the silver lady gave her\r\na hand and they entered the dark passage together\r\n\r\nstephen was thinking if she ought to begin by telling her name  but the\r\nharoun al raschid feeling for adventure incognito is an innate principle\r\nof the sons of men  it was seldom indeed that her life had afforded her\r\nsuch an opportunity\r\n\r\nthe silver lady on her own part also wished for silence as she looked\r\nfor the effect on her companion when the glory of the view should break\r\nupon her  when they had climbed the winding stone stair which led up\r\nsome twenty feet there was a low wide landing with the remains of the\r\nmain shaft of the mill machinery running through it  from one side rose\r\na stone stair curving with the outer wall of the mill tower and guarded\r\nby a heavy iron rail  a dozen steps there were and then a landing a\r\ncouple of yards square then a deep doorway cut in the thickness of the\r\nwall round which the winding stair continued\r\n\r\nthe silver lady who had led the way threw open the door and motioned\r\nto her guest to enter  stephen stood for a few moments surprised as\r\nwell as delighted for the room before her as not like anything which she\r\nhad ever seen or thought of\r\n\r\nit was a section of almost the whole tower and was of considerable size\r\nfor the machinery and even the inner shaft had been removed  east and\r\nsouth and west the wall had been partially cut away so that great wide\r\nwindows nearly the full height of the room showed the magnificent\r\npanorama  in the depths of the ample windows were little cloistered\r\nnooks where one might with a feeling of supersolitude be away from and\r\nabove the world\r\n\r\nthe room was beautifully furnished and everywhere were flowers with\r\nleaves and sprays and branches where possible\r\n\r\neven from where she stood in the doorway stephen had a birdseye view of\r\nthe whole countryside not only of the coast with which she was already\r\nfamiliar and on which her windows at the castle looked but to the south\r\nand west which the hill rising steep behind the castle and to southward\r\nshut out\r\n\r\nthe silver lady could not but notice her guests genuine admiration\r\n\r\nthou likest my room and my view  there is no use asking thee i see\r\nthou dost  stephen answered with a little gasp\r\n\r\ni think it is the quaintest and most beautiful place i have ever seen\r\n\r\ni am so glad thou likest it  i have lived here for nearly forty years\r\nand they have been years of unutterable peace and earthly happiness  and\r\nnow thou wilt have some tea\r\n\r\nstephen left the mill that afternoon with a warmth of heart that she had\r\nbeen a stranger to for many a day  the two women had accepted each other\r\nsimply  i am called ruth said the silver lady  and i am stephen\r\nsaid the countess de lannoy in reply  and that was all neither had any\r\nclue to the others identity  stephen felt that some story lay behind\r\nthat calm sweet personality much sorrow goes to the making of fearless\r\nquietude  the quaker lady moved so little out of her own environment\r\nthat she did not even suspect the identity of her visitor  all that she\r\nknew of change was a notice from the solicitor to the estate that as the\r\nheadship had lapsed into another branch of the possessing family she\r\nmust be prepared if necessary to vacate her tenancy which was one at\r\nwill\r\n\r\nit was not long before stephen availed herself of the permission to come\r\nagain  this time she made up her mind to tell who she was lest the\r\nconcealment of her identity might lead to awkwardness  at that meeting\r\nfriendship became union\r\n\r\nthe natures of the two women expanded to each other and after a very few\r\nmeetings there was established between them a rare confidence  even the\r\npersonal austerity of quakerdom or the state and estate of the peeress\r\ncould not come between  their friendship seemed to be for the life of\r\none  to the other it would be a memory\r\n\r\nthe silver lady never left the chosen routine of her own life  whatever\r\nwas the reason of her giving up the world she kept it to herself and\r\nstephen respected her reticence as much as she did her confidence\r\n\r\nit had become a habit early in their friendship for stephen to ride or\r\nwalk over to the windmill in the dusk of the evening when she felt\r\nespecially lonely  on one such occasion she pushed open the outer door\r\nwhich was never shut and took her way up the stone stair  she knew she\r\nwould find her friend seated in the window with hands folded on lap\r\nlooking out into the silent dusk with that absorbed understanding of\r\nthings which is holier than reverence and spiritually more active than\r\nconscious prayer\r\n\r\nshe tapped the door lightly and stepped into the room\r\n\r\nwith a glad exclamation which coming through her habitual sedateness\r\nshowed how much she loved the young girl sister ruth started to her\r\nfeet  there was something of such truth in the note she had sounded\r\nthat the lonely girls heart went out to her in abandoned fulness  she\r\nheld out her arms and as she came close to the other fell rather than\r\nsank at her feet  the elder woman recognised and knew  she made no\r\neffort to restrain her but sinking back into her own seat laid the\r\ngirls head in her lap and held her hands close against her breast\r\n\r\ntell me she whispered  wont you tell me dear child what troubles\r\nyou  tell me dear  it may bring peace\r\n\r\noh i am miserable miserable miserable moaned stephen in a low voice\r\nwhose despair made the others heart grow cold  the silver lady knew\r\nthat here golden silence was the best of help holding close the others\r\nhands she waited  stephens breast began to heave with an impulsive\r\nmotion she drew away her hands and put them before her burning face\r\nwhich she pressed lower still on the others lap  sister ruth knew that\r\nthe trouble whatever it was was about to find a voice  and then came\r\nin a low shuddering whisper a voice muffled in the folds of the dress\r\n\r\ni killed a man\r\n\r\nin all her life the silver lady had never been so startled or so shocked\r\nshe had grown so to love the bright brilliant young girl that the\r\nwhispered confession cut through the silence of the dusk as a shriek of\r\nmurder goes through the silent gloom of night  her hands flew wide from\r\nher breast and the convulsive shudder which shook her all in an instant\r\nwoke stephen through all her own deep emotion to the instinct of\r\nprotection of the other  the girl looked up shaking her head and said\r\nwith a sadness which stilled all the others fear\r\n\r\nah  dont be frightened  it is not murder that i tell you of  perhaps\r\nif it were the thought would be easier to bear  he would have been hurt\r\nless if it had been only his body that i slew  well i know now that his\r\nlife would have been freely given if i wished it if it had been for my\r\ngood  but it was the best of him that i killed his soul  his noble\r\nloving trusting unselfish soul  the bravest and truest soul that ever\r\nhad place in a mans breast      her speaking ended with a sob her\r\nbody sank lower\r\n\r\nsister ruths heart began to beat more freely  she understood now and\r\nall the womanhood all the wifehood motherhood suppressed for a\r\nlifetime awoke to the womans need  gently she stroked the beautiful\r\nhead that lay so meekly on her lap and as the girl sobbed with but\r\nlittle appearance of abatement she said to her softly\r\n\r\ntell me dear child  tell me all about it  see we are alone together\r\nthou and i and god  in gods dusk with only the silent land and sea\r\nbefore us  wont thou trust me dear one and speak\r\n\r\nand then as the shadows fell and faroff lights at sea began to twinkle\r\nover the waste of waters stephen found voice and told without reserve\r\nthe secret of her shame and her remorse\r\n\r\nat last when her broken voice had trailed away into gentle catchings of\r\nthe breath the older woman knowing that the time come for comfort took\r\nher in her strong arms holding her face wet against her own their tears\r\nmingling\r\n\r\ncry on dear heart she said as she kissed her  cry on  it will do\r\nthee good  she was startled once again as the other seemed for an\r\ninstant to grow rigid in her arms and raising her hands cried out in a\r\nburst of almost hysterical passion\r\n\r\ncry cry  oh my god my god  then becoming conscious of her wet face\r\nshe seemed to become in an instant all limp and sank on her knees again\r\nthere was so different a note in her voice that the others heart leaped\r\nas she heard her say\r\n\r\ngod be thanked for these tears  oh thank god  thank god  looking up\r\nshe saw through the gloom the surprise in her companions eyes and\r\nanswered their query in words\r\n\r\noh you dont know  you cant know what it is to me  i have not cried\r\nsince last i saw him pass from me in the wood\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nthat time of confession seemed to have in some way cleared purified and\r\nsatisfied stephens soul  life was now easier to bear  she was able to\r\nadapt herself justifiably to the needs of her position and all around\r\nher and dependent on her began to realise that amongst them was a\r\ncontrolling force farreaching sympathy and a dominant resolution that\r\nmade for good\r\n\r\nshe began to shake off the gloom of her sorrows and to take her place in\r\nher new high station  friends there were in many and quondam lovers by\r\nthe score  lovers of all sorts  fortunehunters there were be sure not\r\na few  but no need was there for baseness when the lady herself was so\r\ndesirable so young so fair so lovable  that she was of great estate\r\nand richly left made all things possible to any man who had sufficient\r\nacquisitiveness or a good conceit of himself  in a wide circle of\r\ncountry were many truelovers who would have done aught to win her\r\npraise\r\n\r\nand so in the east the passing of the two years of silence and gloom\r\nseemed to be the winning of something brighter to follow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxxthe lesson of the wilderness\r\n\r\n\r\nin the west the two years flew  time seemed to go faster there because\r\nlife was more strenuous  harold being mainly alone found endless work\r\nalways before him  from daylight to dark labour never ceased and for\r\nhis own part he never wished that it should  in the wilderness and\r\nespecially under such conditions as held in northern alaska labour is\r\nnot merely mechanical  every hour of the day is fraught with danger in\r\nsome new form and the head has to play its part in the strife against\r\nnature  in such a life there is not much time for thinking or brooding\r\n\r\nat first when the work and his surroundings were strange to him harold\r\ndid many useless things and ran many unnecessary risks  but his\r\nknowledge grew with experience  privations he had in plenty and all the\r\nfibre of his body and the strength of his resolution and endurance were\r\nnow and again taxed to their utmost  but with a man of his nature and\r\nrace the breaking strain is high and endurance and resolution are\r\nqualities which develop with practice\r\n\r\ngradually his mind came back to normal level he had won seemingly\r\nthrough the pain that shadowed him  without anguish he could now think\r\nremember look forward  then it was that the kindly wisdom of the\r\namerican came back to him and came to stay  he began to examine himself\r\nas to his own part of the unhappy transaction and stray moments of\r\nwonderment came as to whether the fault may not at the very base have\r\nhis own  he began to realise that it is insufficient in this strenuous\r\nworld to watch and wait to suppress ones self to put aside in the\r\nwish to benefit others all the hopes ambitions cravings which make for\r\npersonal gain\r\n\r\nthus it was that harolds thoughts ever circling round stephen came\r\nback with increasing insistence to his duty towards her  he often\r\nthought and with a bitter feeling against himself that it came too late\r\nof the dying trust of her father\r\n\r\nguard her and cherish her as if you were indeed my son and she your\r\nsister    if it should be that you and stephen should find that there\r\nis another affection between you remember i sanction it  but give her\r\ntime  i trust that to you  she is young and the world is all before\r\nher  let her choose    and be loyal to her if it is another  it may\r\nbe a hard task but i trust you harold\r\n\r\nhere he would groan as all the anguish of the past would rush back upon\r\nhim and keenest of all would be the fear suspicion thought which grew\r\ntowards belief that he may have betrayed that trust   \r\n\r\nat first the side of this memory personal to his own happiness was\r\nfaintly emphasised the important side was of the duty to stephen  but\r\nas time went on the other thought became a sort of corollary a timid\r\nhalting blushing thought which followed sheepishly borne down by\r\ntrembling hope  no matter what adventure came to him the thought of\r\nneglected duty returned ever afresh  once when he lay sick for weeks in\r\nan indian wigwam the idea so grew with each day of the monotony that\r\nwhen he was able to crawl out by himself into the sunshine he had almost\r\nmade up his mind to start back for home\r\n\r\nluck is a strange thing  it seems in some mysterious way to be the\r\ndivine machinery for adjusting averages  whatever may be the measure of\r\nhappiness or unhappiness good or evil allotted to anyone luck is the\r\ncause or means of counterbalancing so that the main result reaches the\r\nstandard set\r\n\r\nfrom the time of harolds illness dame fortune seemed to change her\r\nattitude to him  the fierce frown nay the malignant scowl to which he\r\nhad become accustomed changed to a smile  hitherto everything seemed to\r\nhave gone wrong with him but now all at once all seemed to go right  he\r\ngrew strong and hardy again  indeed he seemed by contrast to his late\r\nhelplessness to be so strong and hard that it looked as if that very\r\nillness had done him good instead of harm  game was plentiful and he\r\nnever seemed to want  everywhere he went there were traces of gold as\r\nthough by some instinct he was tracking it to its home  he did not value\r\ngold for its own sake but he did for the ardour of the search  harold\r\nwas essentially a man and as a man an adventurer  to such a man of such\r\na race adventure is the very salt of existence\r\n\r\nthe adventurers instinct took with it the adventurers judgment harold\r\nwas not content with small results  amidst the vast primeval forces\r\nthere were he felt vast results of their prehistoric working and he\r\ndetermined to find some of them  in such a quest purpose is much  it\r\nwas hardly any wonder then that in time harold found himself alone in\r\nthe midst of one of the great treasureplaces of the world  only labour\r\nwas needed to take from the earth riches beyond the dreams of avarice\r\nbut that labour was no easy problem great and difficult distance had to\r\nbe overcome secrecy must be observed for even a whisper of the\r\nexistence of such a place would bring a horde of desperadoes  but all\r\nthese difficulties were at least sources of interest if not in\r\nthemselves pleasures  the new harold seemingly freshly created by a\r\nyear of danger and strenuous toil of selfexamining and humiliation of\r\nthe realisation of duty andthough he knew it not as yetof the\r\ndawning of hope found delight in the thought of dangers and difficulties\r\nto be overcome  having taken his bearings exactly so as to be safe in\r\nfinding the place again he took his specimens with him and set out to\r\nfind the shortest and best route to the nearest port\r\n\r\nat length he came to the port and set quietly about finding men  this he\r\ndid very carefully and very systematically  finally with the full\r\ncomplement and with ample supply of stores he started on his expedition\r\nto the new goldfields\r\n\r\nit is not purposed to set out here the extraordinary growth of robinson\r\ncity for thus the mining camp soon became  its history has long ago\r\nbeen told for all the world  in the early days when everything had to\r\nbe organised and protected harold worked like a giant and with a system\r\nand energy which from the first established him as a master  but when\r\nthe second year of his exile was coming to a close and robinson city was\r\nteeming with life and commerce when banks and police and soldiers made\r\nlife and property comparatively safe he began to be restless again  this\r\nwas not the life to which he had set himself  he had gone into the\r\nwilderness to be away from cities and from men and here a city had\r\nsprung up around him and men claimed him as their chief  moreover with\r\nthe restless feeling there began to come back to him the old thoughts and\r\nthe old pain\r\n\r\nbut he felt strong enough by this time to look forward in life as well as\r\nbackward  with him now to think was to act so much at least he had\r\ngained from his position of dominance in an upspringing city  he quietly\r\nconsolidated such outlying interests as he had placed the management of\r\nhis great estate in the hands of a man he had learned to trust and\r\ngiving out that he was going to san francisco to arrange some business\r\nleft robinson city  he had already accumulated such a fortune that the\r\nworld was before him in any way he might choose to take\r\n\r\nknowing that at san francisco to which he had booked he would have to\r\nrun the gauntlet of certain of his friends and business connections he\r\nmade haste to leave the ship quietly at portland the first point she\r\ntouched on her southern journey  thence he got on the canadian pacific\r\nline and took his way to montreal\r\n\r\nwhat most arrested his attention and in a very disconcerting way were\r\nthe glimpses of english life one sees reproduced so faithfully here and\r\nthere in canada  the whole of the past rushed back on him so\r\noverpoweringly that he was for the moment unnerved  the acute feeling of\r\ncourse soon became mitigated but it was the beginning of a\r\nrerealisation of what had been and which grew stronger with each mile\r\nas the train swept back eastward\r\n\r\nat first he tried to fight it tried with all the resources of his strong\r\nnature  his mind was made up he assured himself over and over again\r\nthe past was past and what had been was no more to him than to any of\r\nthe other passengers of the train  destiny had long ago fulfilled\r\nitself  stephen no doubt had by now found some one worthy of her and had\r\nmarried  in no dream sleeping or waking could he ever admit that she\r\nhad married leonard that was the only gleam of comfort in what had grown\r\nto be remorse for his neglected duty\r\n\r\nand so it was that harold an wolf slowly drifted though he knew it not\r\ninto something of the same intellectual position which had dominated him\r\nwhen he had started on his journeying and the sunset fell nightly on his\r\ndespairing face  the life in the wilderness and then in the dominance\r\nand masterdom of enterprise had hardened and strengthened him into more\r\nselfreliant manhood giving him greater forbearance and a more practical\r\nview of things\r\n\r\nwhen he took ship in the dominion a large cargoboat with some\r\npassengers running to london he had a vague purpose of visiting in\r\nsecret norcester whence he could manage to find out how matters were at\r\nnormanstand  he would then he felt be in a better position to regulate\r\nhis further movements  he knew that he had already a sufficient disguise\r\nin his great beard  he had nothing to fear from the tracing of him on\r\nhis journey from alaska or the interest of his fellowpassengers  he had\r\nall along been so fortunate as to be able to keep his identity concealed\r\nthe name john robinson told nothing in itself and the width of a whole\r\ngreat continent lay between him and the place of his fame  he was able\r\nto take his part freely amongst both the passengers and the officers\r\neven amongst the crew he soon came to be known the men liked his\r\ngeniality and instinctively respected his enormous strength and his\r\nmanifest force of character  men who work and who know danger soon learn\r\nto recognise the forces which overcome both  and as sufficient time had\r\nnot elapsed to impair his hardihood or lower his vast strength he was\r\nfacile princeps  and so the crew acknowledged him to them he was a born\r\ncaptain whom to obey would be a natural duty\r\n\r\nafter some days the weather changed  the great ship which usually\r\nrested evenkeeled on two waves and whose bilge keels under normal\r\nconditions rendered rolling impossible began to pitch and roll like a\r\nleviathan at play  the decks swept by gigantic seas were injured\r\nwherever was anything to injure bulwarks were torn away as though they\r\nhad been compact of paper  more than once the double doors at the head\r\nof the companion stairs had been driven in  the bulls eye glasses of\r\nsome of the ports were beaten from their brazen sockets  nearly all the\r\nboats had been wrecked broken or torn from their cranes as the great\r\nship rolled heavily in the trough or giant waves had struck her till she\r\nquivered like a frightened horse\r\n\r\nat that season she sailed on the far northern course  driven still\r\nfarther north by the gales she came within a short way of south of\r\ngreenland  then avoiding moville which should have been her place of\r\ncall she ran down the east of britain the wild weather still\r\nprevailing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxxithe lifeline\r\n\r\n\r\non the coast of angleshire the weather in the early days of september had\r\nbeen stormy  with the southwest wind had come deluges of rain not a\r\ncommon thing for the time of year on the east coast  stephen whose\r\nspirits always rose with high wind was in a condition of prolonged\r\nexcitement  she could not keep still every day she rode long distances\r\nand found a wonderful satisfaction in facing the strong winds  like a\r\ntrue horsewoman she did not mind the wet and had glorious gallops over\r\nthe grassy ridge and down the slopes on the farther side out on the open\r\nroad or through the endless grass rides amid the pine woods\r\n\r\non the tuesday morning the storm was in full sweep and stephen was in\r\nwild spirits  nothing would do her but to go out on the tower of the\r\ncastle where she could walk about and leaning on the crenellated parapet\r\nlook over all the coast stretching far in front and sweeping away to the\r\nleft and right  the prospect so enchanted her and the fierce sweep of\r\nthe wind so suited her exalted mood that she remained there all the\r\nmorning  the whole coast was a mass of leaping foam and flying spray\r\nand far away to the horizon whitetopped waves rolled endlessly  that\r\nday she did not even ride out but contented herself with watching the\r\nsea and the storm from the tower  after lunch she went to her tower\r\nagain and again after tea  the storm was now furious  she made up her\r\nmind that after dinner she would ride down and see its happenings close\r\nat hand\r\n\r\nwhen she had finished dinner she went to her room to dress for her ride\r\nthe rush and roar of the storm were in her ears and she was in wild\r\ntumultuous spirits  all her youth seemed to sweep back on her or\r\nperhaps it was that the sickness of the last two years was swept away\r\nsomewhere deep down in stephens heart below her intention or even her\r\nconsciousness was a desire to be her old self if only for an hour  and\r\nto this end externals were of help  without weighing the matter in her\r\nmind and acting entirely on impulse she told her maid to get the red\r\nhabit she had not worn for years  when she was dressed she sent round to\r\nhave out her white arab while it was getting ready she went once more to\r\nthe tower to see the stormeffect in the darkening twilight  as she\r\nlooked her heart for an instant stood still  halfway to the horizon a\r\ngreat ship ablaze in the bows was driving through the waves with all\r\nher speed  she was heading towards the little port beyond which the\r\nshallows sent up a moving wall of white spray\r\n\r\nstephen tore down the turret stair and gave hurried directions to have\r\nbeds prepared in a number of rooms fires everywhere and plenty of\r\nprovisions  she also ordered that carriages should be sent at once to\r\nthe fishing port with clothing and restoratives  there would she felt\r\nbe need for such help before a time to be measured by minutes should have\r\npassed and as some of her servants were as yet strange to her ways she\r\ndid not leave anything to chance  one carriage was to go for the doctor\r\nwho lived at lannoy the village over the hill whence nothing could be\r\nseen of what was happening  she knew that others within sight or hailing\r\nwould be already on their way  work was afoot and had she time or\r\nthought of it she would have chosen a more sedate garb  but in the\r\nexcitement no thought of herself came to her\r\n\r\nin a few seconds she was in the saddle tearing at full speed down the\r\nroad that led to the port  the wind was blowing so strongly in her face\r\nthat only in the lulls could she hear the hoofstrokes of the grooms\r\nhorse galloping behind her\r\n\r\nat first the height of the road allowed her to see the ship and the port\r\ntowards which she was making  but presently the road dipped and the\r\ncurving of the hill shut both from her sight it was only when she came\r\nclose that she could see either again\r\n\r\nnow the great ship was close at hand  the flames had gained terribly\r\nand it was a race for life or death  there was no time do more than run\r\nher aground if life was to be saved at all  the captain who in the gaps\r\nof the smoke could be seen upon the bridge knew his work well  as he\r\ncame near the shoal he ran a little north and then turned sharply so as\r\nto throw the boats head to the south of the shoal  thus the wind would\r\ndrive fire and smoke forward and leave the after part of the vessel free\r\nfor a time\r\n\r\nthe shock of her striking the sand was terrific though the tinkle of the\r\nbell borne in on the gale showed that the engines had been slowed down\r\nthe funnels were shaken down and the masts broke off falling forward  a\r\nwild shriek from a hundred throats cleft the roaring of wind and wave\r\nthe mast fell the foremast with all its cumbering tophamper on the\r\nbridge which was in an instant blotted out of existence together with\r\nthe little band of gallant men who stood on it true to their last duty\r\nas the wind took the smoke south a man was seen to climb on the wreck of\r\nthe mast aft and make fast the end of a great coil of rope which he\r\ncarried  he was a huge man with a full dark beard  two sailors working\r\nwith furious haste helped him with the rope  the waves kept raising the\r\nship a little each time bumping her on the sand with a shock  the\r\npeople on deck held frantically to the wreckage around them\r\n\r\nthen the bearded man stripping to his waist and cutting off his trousers\r\nabove the knee fastened an end of the rope round his waist  the sailors\r\nstood ready one behind the other to pay it out  as a great wave rolled\r\nunder the ship he threw himself into the sea\r\n\r\nin the meantime the coastguard had fixed board of trade rocketapparatus\r\nand in a few seconds the prolonged roar of a rocket was heard  it flew\r\nstraight towards the ship rising at a high angle so as to fall beyond\r\nit  but the force of the wind took it up as it rose and the gale\r\nincreased so that it rose nearly vertically and in this position the\r\nwind threw it south of its objective and short of it  another rocket\r\nwas got ready at once and blue lights were burned so that the course of\r\nthe venturous swimmer might be noted  he swam strongly but the great\r\nweight of the rope behind kept pulling him back and the southern trend\r\nof the tide current and the force of the wind kept dragging him from the\r\npier  within the bar the waves were much less than without but they\r\nwere still so unruly that no boat in the harbourwhich was not a\r\nlifeboat stationcould venture out  indeed in the teeth of the storm\r\nit would have been a physical impossibility to have driven one seaward\r\n\r\nas the gathered crowd saw stephen approach they made way for her  she\r\nhad left her horse with the groom and despite the drenching spray fought\r\na way against the wind out on the pier  as in the glare of the blue\r\nlight which brought many things into harsh unnatural perspective she\r\ncaught sight of the set face of the swimmer rising and falling with the\r\nwaves her heart leaped  this was indeed a man a brave man and all the\r\nwoman in her went out to him  for him and to aid him and his work she\r\nwould have given everything done anything and in her heart which beat\r\nin an ecstasy of anxiety she prayed with that desperate conviction of\r\nhope which comes in such moments of exaltation\r\n\r\nbut it soon became apparent that no landing could be effected  the force\r\nof the current and the wind were taking the man too far southward for him\r\never to win a way back  then one of coastguards took the leadtopped\r\ncane which they use for throwing practice and after carefully coiling\r\nthe line attached it so that it would run free managed with a desperate\r\neffort to fling it far out  the swimmer to whom it fell close fought\r\ntowards it frantically and as the cord began to run through the water\r\nmanaged to grasp it  a wild cheer rose from the shore and the ship  a\r\nstout line was fastened to the shore end of the cord and the swimmer\r\ndrew it out to him  he bent it on the rope which trailed behind him\r\nthen seeing that he was himself a drag on it with the knife which he\r\ndrew from the sheath at the back of his waist he cut himself free  one\r\nof the coastguards on the pier helped by a host of willing hands began\r\ndrawing the end of the rope on shore  the swimmer still held the line\r\nthrown to him and several men on the pier began to draw on it  unhappily\r\nthe thin cord broke under the strain and within a few seconds the\r\nswimmer had drifted out of possible help  seeing that only wild rocks\r\nlay south of the seawall and that on them seas beat furiously he\r\nturned and made out for sea  in the light beyond the glare he could see\r\nvaguely the shore bending away to the west in a deep curve of unbroken\r\nwhite leaping foam  there was no hope of landing there  to the south\r\nwas the headland perhaps two miles away as the crow flies  here was the\r\nonly chance for him  if he could round the headland he might find\r\nshelter beyond or somewhere along the farther shore some opening might\r\npresent itself  whilst the light from the blue fires still reached him\r\nhe turned and made for the headland\r\n\r\nin the meantime on ship and on shore men worked desperately  before long\r\nthe end of the hawser was carried round on the high cliff and pulled as\r\ntaut as the force at hand could manage and made fast  soon endless\r\nropes were bringing in passengers and crew as fast as place could be\r\nfound for them  it became simply a race for time  if the fire working\r\nagainst the wind did not reach the hawser and if the ship lasted the\r\nfurious bumping on the sandbank which threatened to shake her to pieces\r\neach moment all on board might yet be saved\r\n\r\nstephens concern was now for the swimmer alone  such a gallant soul\r\nshould not perish without help if help could be on this side of heaven\r\nshe asked the harbourmaster an old fisherman who knew every inch of the\r\ncoast for miles if anything could be done  he shook his head sadly as\r\nhe answered\r\n\r\ni fear no my lady  the lifeboat from granport is up north no boat\r\nfrom here could get outside the harbour  theres never a spot in the bay\r\nwhere he could land even in a less troubled sea than this  wi the wind\r\nashore theres no hope for ship or man here that cannot round the point\r\nand a stranger is no like to do that\r\n\r\nwhy not she asked breathlessly\r\n\r\nbecause my lady theres a wheen o sunken rocks beyond the head  no\r\none that didnt know would ever think to keep out beyond them for the\r\ncliff itself goes down sheer  hes a gallant soul yon an its a sore\r\npity hes goin to his death  but it must be  god can save him if he\r\nwishes but i fear none other\r\n\r\neven as he spoke rose to stephens mind a memory of an old churchyard\r\nwith great trees and the scent of many flowers and a childs voice that\r\nsounded harsh through the monotonous hum of bees\r\n\r\nto be god and able to do things\r\n\r\noh to be god if but an hour and able to do things  to do anything to\r\nhelp a brave man  a wild prayer surged up in the girls heart\r\n\r\noh god give me this mans life  give it to me to atone for the other\r\ni destroyed  let me but help him and do with me as thou wilt\r\n\r\nthe passion of her prayer seemed to help her and her brain cleared\r\nsurely something could be done  she would do what she could but first\r\nshe must understand the situation  she turned again to the old harbour\r\nmaster\r\n\r\nhow long would it take him to reach the headland if he can swim so\r\nfar  the answer came with a settled conviction bearing hope with it\r\n\r\nthe wind and tide are wi him an hes a strong swimmer  perhaps half\r\nan hour will take him there  hes all right in himself  he can swim it\r\nsure  but alack its when he gets there his trouble will be when none\r\ncan warn him  look how the waves are lashing the cliff and mark the\r\nwhite water beyond  what voice can sound to him out in those deeps  how\r\ncould he see if even one were there to warn\r\n\r\nhere was a hope at any rate  light and sound were the factors of safety\r\nsome good might be effected if she could get a trumpet and there were\r\ntrumpets in the rocketcart  light could be hadmust be had if all the\r\nfences round the headland had to be gathered for a bonfire  there was\r\nnot a moment to be lost  she ran to the rocketcart and got a trumpet\r\nfrom the man in charge  then she ran to where she had left her horse\r\nshe had plenty of escort for by this time many gentlemen had arrived on\r\nhorseback from outlying distances and all offered their services  she\r\nthanked them and said\r\n\r\nyou may be useful here  when all these are ashore send on the rocket\r\ncart and come yourselves to the headland as quick as you can  tell the\r\ncoastguards that all those saved are to be taken to the castle  in the\r\nrocketcart bring pitch and tar and oil and anything that will flame\r\nstay she cried to the chief boatman  give me some blue lights  his\r\nanswer chilled her\r\n\r\nim sorry my lady but they are all used  there are the last of them\r\nburning now  we have burned them ever since that man began to swim\r\nashore\r\n\r\nthen hurry on the rocketcart she said as she sprang to the saddle\r\nand swept out on the rough track that ran by the cliffs following in\r\nbold curves the windings of the shore  the white arab seemed to know\r\nthat his speed was making for life  as he swept along far outdistancing\r\nthe groom stephens heart went out in silent words which seemed to keep\r\ntime to the gallop\r\n\r\noh to be god and be able to do things  give me this mans life oh\r\ngod  give me this mans life to atone for that noble one which i\r\ndestroyed\r\n\r\nfaster and faster over rough road cattle track and grassy sward over\r\nrising and falling ground now and again so close to the edge of the high\r\ncliff that the spume swept up the gulleys in the rocks like a snowstorm\r\nthe white arab swept round the curve of the bay and came out on the high\r\nheadland where stood the fishers house  on the very brink of the cliff\r\nall the fisher folk men women and children stood looking at the far\r\noff burning ship from which the flames rose in leaping columns\r\n\r\nso intent were all on the cliff that they did not notice her coming as\r\nthe roar of the wind came from them to her they could not hear her voice\r\nwhen she spoke from a distance  she had drawn quite close having\r\ndismounted and hung her rein over the post of the garden paling when one\r\nof the children saw her and cried out\r\n\r\nthe lady the lady an shes all in red  the men were so intent on\r\nsomething that they did not seem to hear  they were peering out to the\r\nnorth and were arguing in dumb show as though on something regarding\r\nwhich they did not agree  she drew closer and touching the old\r\nfisherman on the shoulder called out at his ear\r\n\r\nwhat is it  he answered without turning keeping his eyes fixed\r\n\r\ni say its a man swimmin  joe and garge here say as its only a\r\npiece o wood or seawrack  but i know im right  thats a man\r\nswimmin or my old eyes have lost their power  his words carried\r\nconviction the seed of hope in her beating heart grew on the instant\r\ninto certainty\r\n\r\nit is a man  i saw him swim off towards here when he had taken the\r\nrope on shore  do not turn round  keep your eyes on him so that you may\r\nnot lose sight of him in the darkness  the old man chuckled\r\n\r\nthis darkness  hee hee  there be no differ to me between light and\r\ndark  but ill watch him  its you my lady  i shant turn round to do\r\nmy reverence as you tell me to watch  but poor soul itll not be for\r\nlong to watch  the skyres will have him sure enow\r\n\r\nwe can warn him she said when he comes close enough  i have a\r\ntrumpet here  he shook his head sorrowfully\r\n\r\nah my lady what trumpet could sound against that storm an from this\r\nheight  stephens heart sank  but there was still hope  if the\r\nswimmers ears could not be reached his eyes might  eagerly she looked\r\nback for the coming of the rocketcart  far off across the deep bay she\r\ncould see its lamp sway as it passed over the rough ground but alas it\r\nwould never arrive in time  with a note of despair in her voice she\r\nasked\r\n\r\nhow long before he reaches the rocks  still without turning the old\r\nman answered\r\n\r\nat the rate hes going he will be in the sweep of the current through\r\nthe rocks within three minutes  if hes to be saved he must turn seaward\r\nere the stream grips him\r\n\r\nwould there be time to build a bonfire\r\n\r\nno no my lady  the wood couldnt catch in the time\r\n\r\nfor an instant a black film of despair seemed to fall on her  the\r\nsurging of the blood in her head made her dizzy and once again the\r\nprayer of the old memory rang in her brain\r\n\r\noh to be god and able to do things\r\n\r\non the instant an inspiration flashed through her  she too could do\r\nthings in a humble way  she could do something at any rate  if there\r\nwas no time to build a fire there was a fire already built\r\n\r\nthe house would burn\r\n\r\nthe two feet deep of old thatch held down with nets and battened with\r\nwreck timber would flare like a beacon  forthwith she spoke\r\n\r\ngood people this noble man who has saved a whole shipload of others\r\nmust not die without an effort  there must be light so that he can see\r\nour warning to pass beyond the rocks  the only light can be from the\r\nhouse  i buy it of you  it is mine but i shall pay you for it and\r\nbuild you such another as you never thought of  but it must be fired at\r\nonce  you have one minute to clear out all you want  in quick and take\r\nall can  quick quick for gods sake  it is for a brave mans life\r\n\r\nthe men and women without a word rushed into the house  they too knew\r\nthe danger and the only hope there was for a life  the assurance of the\r\ncountess took the sting from the present loss  before the minute which\r\nshe timed watch in hand was over all came forth bearing armloads of\r\ntheir lares and penates  then one of the younger men ran in again and\r\nout bearing a flaming stick from the fire  stephen nodded he held it to\r\nthe northern edge of the thatch  the straw caught in a flash and the\r\nflame ran up the slope and along the edge of the roof like a quick match\r\nthe squeaking of many rats was heard and their brown bodies streamed over\r\nthe roof  before another minute had passed a great mass of flame towered\r\ninto the sky and shed a red light far out over the waste of sea\r\n\r\nit lit up the wilderness of white water where the sea churned savagely\r\namongst the sunken rocks and it lit too the white face of a swimmer now\r\nnearly spent who rising and falling with each wave drifted in the sea\r\nwhose current bore him on towards the fatal rocks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxxiito be god and able to do things\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen the swimmer saw the light he looked up even at the distance they\r\ncould see the lift of his face but he did not seem to realise that there\r\nwas any intention in the lighting or that it was created for his\r\nbenefit  he was manifestly spent with his tremendous exertions and with\r\nhis long heavy swim in the turbulent sea  stephens heart went out to\r\nhim in a wave of infinite pity  she tried to use the trumpet  but\r\nsimple as it is a trumpet needs skill or at least practice in its use\r\nshe could only make an unintelligible sound and not much even of that\r\none of the young men said\r\n\r\nlet me try it my lady  she handed him the trumpet and he in turn used\r\nwith a will  but it was of no avail even his strong lungs and lusty\r\nmanhood availed nothing in the teeth of that furious gale  the roof and\r\nthe whole house was now well alight and the flame roared and leapt\r\nstephen began to make gestures bidding the swimmer in case he might see\r\nher and understand move round the rocks  but he made no change in his\r\ndirection and was fast approaching a point in the tiderace whence to\r\navoid the sunken rocks would be an impossibility  the old whaler\r\naccustomed to use all his wits in times of difficulty said suddenly\r\n\r\nhow can he understand when were all between him and the light  we are\r\nonly black shadows to him all he can see are waving arms  his sons\r\ncaught his meaning and were already dashing towards the burning house\r\nthey came back with piles of blazing wood and threw them down on the very\r\nedge of the cliff brought more and piled them up flinging heaps of\r\nstraw on the bonfire and pouring on oil and pitch till the flames rose\r\nhigh  stephen saw what was necessary and stood out of the way but close\r\nto the old whaler where the light fell on both of their faces as they\r\nlooked in the direction of the swimmer  stephens red dress itself stood\r\nout like a flame  the gale tearing up the front of the cliff had whirled\r\naway her hat in the stress of the wind her hair was torn from its up\r\npinning and flew wide itself like leaping flame\r\n\r\nher gestures as she swept her right arm round as though demonstrating\r\nthe outward curve of a circle or raising the hand above her head\r\nmotioned with wide palm and spread fingers back back seemed to have\r\nreached the swimmers intelligence  he half rose in the water and looked\r\nabout  as if seeing something that he realised he sank back again and\r\nbegan swim frantically out to sea  a great throb of joy made stephen\r\nalmost faint  at last she had been able to do something to help this\r\ngallant man  in half a minute his efforts seemed to tell in his race for\r\nlife  he drew sufficiently far from dangerous current for there to be a\r\nhope that he might be saved if he could last out the stress to come\r\n\r\nthe fishermen kept watch in silent eagerness and in their presence\r\nstephen felt a comfort though like her they could do nothing at\r\npresent\r\n\r\nwhen the swimmer had passed sufficiently far out to be clear of the\r\nrocks the fire began to lose its flame though not its intensity  it\r\nwould be fiery still for hours to come and of great heat but the flames\r\nceased to leap and in the moderated light stephen only saw the white\r\nface for one more instant ere it faded out of her ken when turning the\r\nman looked towards the light and made a gesture which she did not\r\nunderstand for he put for an instant both hands before his face\r\n\r\njust then there was a wild noise on the cliff  the rocketcart drawn by\r\nsixteen splendid horses some of them hunters came tearing up the slope\r\nand with it many men on horseback afoot  many of the runners were the\r\ngentlemen who had given their horses for the good work\r\n\r\nas the coastguards jumped from the cart and began to get out the rocket\r\nstand the old whaler pointed out the direction where the swimmers head\r\ncould still be seen  some of the sailors could see it too though to\r\nstephen and the laymen it was invisible  the chief boatman shook his\r\nhead\r\n\r\nno use throwing a line there  even if he got it we could never drag him\r\nalive through these rocks  he would be pounded to death before twenty\r\nfathom  stephens heart grew cold as she listened  was this the end\r\nthen with a bitter cry she wailed\r\n\r\noh can nothing be done  can nothing be done  can no boat come from\r\nthe other side of the point  must such a brave man be lost and her\r\ntears began to flow\r\n\r\none of the young men who had just arrived a neighbouring squire a\r\nproved wastrel but a fine horseman who had already regarded stephen at\r\nthe few occasions of their meeting with eyes of manifest admiration\r\nspoke up\r\n\r\ndont cry lady de lannoy  theres a chance for him yet  ill see what\r\ni can do\r\n\r\nbless you oh bless you she cried impulsively as she caught his hand\r\nthen came the chill of doubt  but what can you do she added\r\ndespairingly\r\n\r\nhector and i may be able to do something together  turning to one of\r\nthe fishermen he asked\r\n\r\nis there any way down to the water in the shelter of the point\r\n\r\nay ay sir came the ready answer  theres the path as we get down\r\nby to our boats\r\n\r\ncome on then he said  some of you chaps show us a light on the way\r\ndown  if hector can manage the scramble theres a chance  you see he\r\nsaid turning again to stephen hector can swim like a fish  when he\r\nwas a racer i trained him in the sea so that none of the touts could spy\r\nout his form  manys the swim weve had together and in rough water\r\ntoo though in none so wild as this\r\n\r\nbut it is a desperate chance for you said stephen womanlike drawing\r\nsomewhat back from a danger she had herself evoked  the young man\r\nlaughed lightly\r\n\r\nwhat of that  i may do one good thing before i die  that fine fellows\r\nlife is worth a hundred of my wasted one  here some of you fellows help\r\nme with hector  we must take him from the cart and get a girth on him\r\ninstead of the saddle  we shall want something to hold on to without\r\npulling his head down by using the bridle\r\n\r\nhe followed by some others ran to the rocketcart where the horses\r\nstood panting their steam rising in a white cloud in the glow of the\r\nburning house  in an incredibly short time the horse was ready with only\r\nthe girth  the young squire took him by the mane and he followed\r\neagerly he had memories of his own  as they passed close to stephen the\r\nsquire said to one of his friends\r\n\r\nhold him a minute jack  he ran over to stephen and looked at her\r\nhard\r\n\r\ngoodbye  wish me luck and give us light  tears were in her eyes and\r\na flush on her cheek as she took his hand and clasped it hard\r\n\r\noh you brave man  god bless you  he stooped suddenly and impulsively\r\nkissed the back of her hand lightly and was gone  for a fleeting moment\r\nshe was angry  no man had kissed her hand before but the thought of his\r\nliberty was swept away by another\r\n\r\nlittle enough when he may be going to his death\r\n\r\nit was a sight to see that man and horse surrounded by an eager crowd of\r\nhelpers scrambling down the rough zigzag cut and worn in the very face\r\nof the cliff  they stumbled and slipped pebbles and broken rock fell\r\naway under their feet  alone close to the bonfire stood stephen\r\nfollowing every movement with racing blood and beating heart  the\r\nbonfire was glowing a constant stream of men and women were dragging and\r\nhauling all sorts of material for its increase  the head of the swimmer\r\ncould be seen rising and falling amid the waves beyond the skyres\r\n\r\nwhen about twenty feet from the waterlevel the path jutted out to one\r\nside left of the little beach whereon the sea now broke fiercely  this\r\nwas a place where men watched and whence at times they fished with rods\r\nthe broad rock overhung the water  the fire above though it threw\r\nshadows made light enough for everything  the squire held up his hand\r\n\r\nstop  we can take off this rock if the water is deep enough  how much\r\nis it\r\n\r\nten fathoms sheer\r\n\r\ngood  he motioned to them all to keep back  then threw off all his\r\nclothes except shirt and trousers  for an instant he patted hector and\r\nthen sprang upon his back  holding him by the mane he urged him forward\r\nwith a cry  the noble animal did not hesitate an instant  he knew that\r\ngrasp of the mane that cry that dig of the spurless heels  he sprang\r\nforward with wide dilated nostrils and from the edge of the jutting rock\r\njumped far out into the sea  man and horse disappeared for a few\r\nseconds but rose safely  the man slid from the horses back and\r\nholding by the girth with one hand swam beside him out to sea in the\r\ndirection the swimmer must come on rounding the sunken rocks\r\n\r\na wild cheer broke from all on the cliff above and those already\r\nscrambling back up the zigzag  stephen kept encouraging the men to bring\r\nfuel to the bonfire\r\n\r\nbring everything you can find the carts the palings the roofs the\r\ncorn the dried fish anything and everything that will burn  we must\r\nhave light plenty of light  two brave mens lives are at stake now\r\n\r\nthe whole place was a scene of activity  stephen stood on the edge of\r\nthe cliff with the old whaler and the chief boatman and some of the\r\nwomen  the rest of the coastguards were by orders of their chief rigging\r\nup a whip which they thought might be necessary to hoist the men up from\r\nthe water if they could ever get close enough  one of the young men who\r\nhad ridden with the rocketcart kept tight hold of hectors bridle he\r\nknew it would be wanted if the horse ever had a chance of landing\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nwhen harold turned away from the dazzling blue lights on the pier and\r\nsaw the far white line of the cliffs beyond the bay his heart sank\r\nwithin him  even his great strength and hardihood won by work and\r\nprivation in the far northwest had been already taxed in the many days\r\nof the battling with the gale when all on board who could lend a hand\r\nwere taken into service  again by the frantic struggle of the last hour\r\nor two when the ship ran shoreward at the utmost of her speed in the\r\nlast hope of beaching in time to save life  finally in that grim\r\nstruggle to draw the lifeline shoreward  the cold and then the great\r\nheat and on top of it the chill of the long swim seemed to have struck\r\nat him  alone on the dark sea for soon the current and his own\r\nexertions were taking him away from the rocks the light of the burning\r\nship was ceasing to be effective  it was just enough to hinder his\r\nvision looking from the patch of light which bathed the light and him he\r\ncould just see far off the white water which marked the cliff fronts and\r\non the edge of his horizon the grim moving white wall where the waves\r\nbroke on the headland\r\n\r\non and on he toiled  his limbs were becoming more cramped with the cold\r\nand the terrible strain of swimming in such waves  but still the brave\r\nheart bore him up and resolutely sternly he forced himself afresh to\r\nthe effort before him  he reasoned that where there was such a headland\r\nstanding out so stark into the sea there ought to be some shelter in its\r\nlee  if he could pass it he might find calmer water and even a landing\r\nplace beyond\r\n\r\nhere at least was hope  he would try to round the point at any rate  now\r\nhe drew so close that the great rocks seemed to tower vast above him  he\r\nwas not yet close enough to feel as though lapped in their shadow but\r\neven the overcast sky seemed full of light above the line of the cliff\r\nthere was a strange roaring rushing sound around him  he thought that\r\nit was not merely the waves dashing on the rocks but that partly it came\r\nfrom his own ears that his ebbing strength was feeling the frantic\r\nstruggle which he was making  the end was coming he thought but still\r\nhe kept valiantly on set and silent as is the way with brave men\r\n\r\nsuddenly from the top of the cliff a bright light flashed  he looked at\r\nit sideways as he fought his way on and saw the light rise and fall and\r\nflicker as the flames leaped  high over him he saw fantastic figures\r\nwhich seemed to dance on the edge of the high cliff  they had evidently\r\nnoticed him and were making signals of some sort but what the motions\r\nwere he could not see or understand for they were but dark silhouettes\r\nedged with light against the background of fire  the only thing he\r\ncould think was that they meant to encourage him and so he urged himself\r\nto further effort  it might be that help was at hand\r\n\r\nseveral times as he turned his head sideways he saw the figures and the\r\nlight but not so clearly it was as though the light was lessening in\r\npower  when again he looked he saw a new fire leap out on the edge of\r\nthe cliff and some figures to the right of it  they were signalling in\r\nsome way  so pausing in his swimming he rose a little from the water\r\nand looked at them\r\n\r\na thrill shot through him and a paralysing thought that he must have\r\ngone mad  with his wet hand he cleared his eyes though the touching\r\nthem pained him terribly and for an instant saw clearly\r\n\r\nthere on the edge of the cliff standing beside some men and waving her\r\narms in a wild sweep as though motioning frantically keep out keep\r\nout was a woman  instinctively he glanced to his left and saw a white\r\nwaste of leaping water through which sharp rocks rose like monstrous\r\nteeth  on the instant he saw the danger and made out seaward swimming\r\nfrantically to clear the dangerous spot before the current would sweep\r\nhim upon the rocks\r\n\r\nbut the woman  as one remembers the last sight when the lightning has\r\nbanished sight so that vision seemed burned into his brain  a woman\r\nwith a scarlet ridinghabit and masses of long red hair blowing in the\r\ngale like leaping flame  could there be two such persons in the world\r\nno no  it was a vision  a vision of the woman he loved come to save\r\nhim in the direst moment of great peril\r\n\r\nhis heart beat with new hope only the blackness of the stormy sea was\r\nbefore him as he strove frantically on\r\n\r\npresently when he felt the current slacken for he had been swimming\r\nacross it and could feel its power he turned and looked back  as he did\r\nso he murmured aloud\r\n\r\na dream  a vision  she came to warn me  for as he looked all had\r\ndisappeared  cliff and coastline dark rocks and leaping seas blazing\r\nfire and the warning vision of the woman he loved\r\n\r\nagain he looked where the waste of sea churning amongst the sunken rocks\r\nhad been  he could hear the roaring of waters the thunder of great\r\nwaves beating on the ironbound coast but nothing could he see  he was\r\nalone on the wild sea in the dark\r\n\r\nthen truly the swift shadow of despair fell upon him\r\n\r\nblind  blind he moaned and for the moment stricken with despair\r\nsank into the trough of the waves  but the instinctive desire for life\r\nrecalled him  once more he fought his way up to the surface and swam\r\nblindly desperately on  seeing nothing he did not know which way he\r\nwas going  he might have heard better had his eyes been able to help his\r\nears but in the sudden strange darkness all the senses were astray  in\r\nthe agony of his mind he could not even feel the pain of his burnt face\r\nthe torture of his eyes had passed  but with the instinct of a strong\r\nman he kept on swimming blindly desperately\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nit seemed as if ages of untold agony had gone by when he heard a voice\r\nseemingly beside him\r\n\r\nlay hold here  catch the girth  the voice came muffled by wind and\r\nwave  his strength was now nearly at its last\r\n\r\nthe shock of his blindness and the agony of the moments that had passed\r\nhad finished his exhaustion  but a little longer and he must have sunk\r\ninto his rest  but the voice and the help it promised rallied him for a\r\nmoment  he had hardly strength to speak but he managed to gasp out\r\n\r\nwhere where  help me  i am blind  a hand took his and guided it to\r\na tightened girth  instinctively his fingers closed round it and he\r\nhung on grimly  his senses were going fast  he felt as if it was all a\r\nstrange dream  a voice here in the sea  a girth  a horse he could\r\nhear its hard breathing\r\n\r\nthe voice came again\r\n\r\nsteady  hold on  my god hes fainted  i must tie him on  he heard\r\na tearing sound and something was wound round his wrists  then his\r\nnerveless fingers relaxed their hold and all passed into oblivion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxxiiithe queens room\r\n\r\n\r\nto stephen all that now happened seemed like a dream  she saw hector and\r\nhis gallant young master forge across the smoother water of the current\r\nwhose boisterous stream had been somewhat stilled in the churning amongst\r\nthe rocks and then go north in the direction of the swimmer who strange\r\nto say was drifting in again towards the sunken rocks  then she saw the\r\nswimmers head sink under the water and her heart grew cold  was this\r\nto be the end  was such a brave man to be lost after such gallant effort\r\nas he had made and just at the moment when help was at hand\r\n\r\nthe few seconds seemed ages  instinctively she shut her eyes and prayed\r\nagain  oh god  give me this mans life that i may atone\r\n\r\ngod seemed to have heard her prayer  nay more  he had mercifully\r\nallowed her to be the means of averting great danger  she would never\r\ncould never forget the look on the mans face when he saw by the flame\r\nthat she had kindled ahead of him the danger from the sunken rocks  she\r\nhad exulted at the thought  and now   \r\n\r\nshe was recalled by a wild cheer beside her  opening her eyes she saw\r\nthat the mans head had risen again from the water  he was swimming\r\nfuriously this time seaward  but close at hand were the heads of the\r\nswimming horse and man    she saw the young squire seize the man   \r\n\r\nand then the rush of her tears blinded her  when she could see again the\r\nhorse had turned and was making back again to the shelter of the point\r\nthe squire had his arm stretched across the horses back he was holding\r\nup the sailors head which seemed to roll helplessly with every motion\r\nof the cumbering sea\r\n\r\nfor a little she thought he was dead but the voice of the old whaler\r\nreassured her\r\n\r\nhe was just in time  the poor chap was done  and so with beating\r\nheart and eyes that did not flinch now she watched the slow progress to\r\nthe shelter of the point  the coastguards and fishermen had made up\r\ntheir minds where the landing could be made and were ready on the rocky\r\nshelf whence hector had at jumped they stood by with lines  when the\r\nsquire had steered and encouraged the horse whose snorting could be\r\nheard from the sheltered water till he was just below the rocks they\r\nlowered a noosed rope  this he fastened round the senseless man below\r\nhis shoulders  one strong careful pull and he was safe on land and\r\nsoon was being borne up the steep zigzag on the shoulders of the willing\r\ncrowd\r\n\r\nin the meantime other ropes were passed down to the squire  one he\r\nplaced round his own waist two others he fastened one on each side of\r\nthe horses girth  then his friend lowered the bridle and he managed to\r\nput it on the horse and attached a rope to it  the fishermen took the\r\nlines and paying out as they went so as to leave plenty of slack line\r\ngot on the rocks just above the little beach whereon sheltered though it\r\nwas the seas broke heavily  there they waited ready to pull the horse\r\nthrough the surf when he should have come close enough\r\n\r\nstephen did not see the rescue of the horse for just then a tall grave\r\nman spoke to her\r\n\r\npardon me lady de lannoy but is the man to be brought up to the\r\ncastle  i am told you have given orders that all the rescued shall be\r\ntaken there  she answered unhesitatingly\r\n\r\ncertainly  i gave orders before coming out that preparation was to be\r\nmade for them\r\n\r\ni am mr hilton  i have just come down to do lacum tenens for dr\r\nwinter at lannoch port  i rode over on hearing there was a wreck and\r\ncame here with the rocketcart  i shall take charge of the man and bring\r\nhim up  he will doubtless want some special care\r\n\r\nif you will be so good she answered feeling a diffidence which was\r\nnew to her  at that moment the crowd carrying the senseless man began to\r\nappear over the cliff coming up the zigzag  the doctor hurried towards\r\nhim she followed at a little distance fearing lest she should hamper\r\nhim  under his orders they laid the patient on the weather side of the\r\nbonfire so that the smoke would not reach him  the doctor knelt by his\r\nside\r\n\r\nan instant after he looked up and said\r\n\r\nhe is alive his heart is beating though faintly  he had better be\r\ntaken away at once  there is no means here of shelter\r\n\r\nbring him in the rocketcart it is the only conveyance here cried\r\nstephen  and bring mr hepburn too  he also will need some care after\r\nhis gallant service  i shall ride on and advise my household of your\r\ncoming  and you good people come all to the castle  you are to be my\r\nguests if you will so honour me  no  no  really i should prefer to\r\nride alone\r\n\r\nshe said this impulsively seeing that several of the gentlemen were\r\nrunning for their horses to accompany her  i shall not wait to thank\r\nthat valiant young gentleman  i shall see him at lannoy\r\n\r\nas she was speaking she had taken the bridle of her horse  one of the\r\nyoung men stooped and held his hand she bowed put her foot in it and\r\nsprang to the saddle  in an instant she was flying across country at\r\nfull speed in the dark  a wild mood was on her reaction from the\r\nprolonged agony of apprehension  there was little which she would not\r\nhave done just then\r\n\r\nthe gale whistled round her and now and again she shouted with pure joy\r\nit seemed as if god himself had answered her prayer and given her the\r\nreturning life\r\n\r\nby the time she had reached the castle the wild ride had done its\r\nsoothing work  she was calm again comparatively her wits and feelings\r\nwere her own\r\n\r\nthere was plenty to keep her occupied mind and body  the train of\r\npersons saved from the wreck were arriving in all sorts of vehicles and\r\nas clothes had to be found for them as well as food and shelter there was\r\nno end to the exertions necessary  she felt as though the world were not\r\nwide enough for the welcome she wished to extend  its exercise was a\r\nsort of reward of her exertions a thankoffering for the response to her\r\nprayer  she moved amongst her guests forgetful of herself of her\r\nstrange attire of the state of dishevelment and grime in which she was\r\nthe result of the storm her long ride over rough ground with its share\r\nof marshes and pools and the smoke from the bonfire and the blazing\r\nhouse  the strangers wondered at first till they came to understand\r\nthat she was the lady bountiful who had stretched her helpful hands to\r\nthem  those who could made themselves useful with the new batches of\r\narrivals  the whole castle was lit from cellar to tower  the kitchens\r\nwere making lordly provision the servants were carrying piles of clothes\r\nof all sorts and helping to fit those who came still wet from their\r\npassage through or over the heavy sea\r\n\r\nin the general disposition of chambers stephen ordered to be set apart\r\nfor the rescued swimmer the royal chamber where queen elizabeth had lain\r\nand for mr hepburn that which had been occupied by the second george\r\nshe had a sort of idea that the stranger was gods guest who was coming\r\nto her house and that nothing could be too good for him  as she waited\r\nfor his coming even though she swept to and fro in her ministrations to\r\nothers she felt as though she trod on air  some great weight seemed to\r\nhave been removed from her  her soul was free again\r\n\r\nat last the rocketcart arrived and with it many horsemen and such men\r\nand women as could run across country with equal speed to the horses\r\nlabouring by the longer road\r\n\r\nthe rescued man was still senseless but that alone did not seem to cause\r\nanxiety to the doctor who hurried him at once into the prepared room\r\nwhen assisted by some of the other men he had undressed him rubbed him\r\ndown and put him to bed and had seen some of the others who had been\r\nrescued from the wreck he sought out lady de lannoy  he told her that\r\nhis anxiety was for the mans sight an announcement which blanched his\r\nhearers cheeks  she had so made up her mind as to his perfect safety\r\nthat the knowledge of any kind of ill came like a cruel shock  she\r\nquestioned mr hilton closely so closely that he thought it well to tell\r\nher at once all that he surmised and feared\r\n\r\nthat fine young fellow who swam out with his horse to him tells me that\r\nwhen he neared him he cried out that he was blind  i have made some\r\ninquiries from those on the ship and they tell me that he was a\r\npassenger named robinson  not only was he not blind then but he was\r\nthe strongest and most alert man on the ship  if it be blindness it must\r\nhave come on during that long swim  it may be that before leaving the\r\nship he received some special injuryindeed he has several cuts and\r\nburns and bruisesand that the irritation of the seawater increased it\r\ni can do nothing till he wakes  at present he is in such a state that\r\nnothing can be done for him  later i shall if necessary give him a\r\nhypodermic to ensure sleep  in the morning when i come again i shall\r\nexamine him fully\r\n\r\nbut you are not going away tonight said stephen in dismay  cant\r\nyou manage to stay here  indeed you must  look at all these people\r\nsome of whom may need special attention or perhaps treatment  we do not\r\nknow yet if any may be injured  he answered at once\r\n\r\nof course i shall stay if you wish it  but there are two other doctors\r\nhere already  i must go over to my own place to get some necessary\r\ninstruments for the examination of this special patient  but that i can\r\ndo in the early morning\r\n\r\ncan i not send for what you want the whole household are at your\r\nservice  all that can be done for that gallant man must be done  you\r\ncan send to london for special help if you wish  if that man is blind\r\nor in danger of blindness we must have the best oculist in the world for\r\nhim\r\n\r\nall shall be done that is possible said he earnestly  but till i\r\nexamine him in the morning we can do nothing  i am myself an oculist\r\nthat is my department in st stephens hospital  i have an idea of what\r\nis wrong but i cannot diagnose exactly until i can use the\r\nophthalmoscope  his words gave stephen confidence  laying her hand on\r\nhis arm unconsciously in the extremity of pity she said earnestly\r\n\r\noh do what you can for him  he must be a noble creature and all that\r\nis possible must be done  i shall never rest happily if through any\r\nfailing on my part he suffers as you fear\r\n\r\ni shall do all i can he said with equal earnestness touched with her\r\neager pity  and i shall not trust myself alone if any other can be of\r\nservice  depend upon it lady de lannoy all shall be as you wish\r\n\r\nthere was little sleep in the castle that night till late  mr hilton\r\nslept on a sofa in the queens room after he had administered a narcotic\r\nto his patient\r\n\r\nas soon as the eastern sky began to quicken he rode as he had arranged\r\nduring the evening to dr winters house at lannoch port where he was\r\nstaying  after selecting such instruments and drugs as he required he\r\ncame back in the dogcart\r\n\r\nit was still early morning when he regained the castle  he found lady de\r\nlannoy up and looking anxiously for him  her concern was somewhat abated\r\nwhen he was able to tell her that his patient still slept\r\n\r\nit was a painful scene for mr hilton when his patient woke  fortunately\r\nsome of the aftereffects of the narcotic remained for his despair at\r\nrealising that he was blind was terrible  it was not that he was\r\nviolent to be so under his present circumstances would have been foreign\r\nto harolds nature  but there was a despair which was infinitely more\r\nsad to witness than passion  he simply moaned to himself\r\n\r\nblind  blind and again in every phase of horrified amazement as\r\nthough he could not realise the truth blind  blind  the doctor laid\r\nhis hand on his breast and said very gently\r\n\r\nmy poor fellow it is a dreadful thing to face to think of  but as yet\r\ni have not been able to come to any conclusion unable even to examine\r\nyou  i do not wish to encourage hopes that may be false but there are\r\ncases when injury is not vital and perhaps only temporary  in such case\r\nyour best chance indeed your only chance is to keep quiet  you must\r\nnot even think if possible of anything that may excite you  i am now\r\nabout to examine you with the ophthalmoscope  you are a man none of us\r\nwho saw your splendid feat last night can doubt your pluck  now i want\r\nyou to use some of it to help us both  you for your recovery if such\r\nis possible me to help me in my work  i have asked some of your late\r\ncompanions who tell me that on shipboard you were not only well and of\r\ngood sight but that you were remarkable even amongst strong men\r\nwhatever it is you suffer from must have come on quickly  tell me all\r\nyou can remember of it\r\n\r\nthe doctor listened attentively whilst harold told all he could remember\r\nof his sufferings  when he spoke of the return of old rheumatic pains\r\nhis hearer said involuntarily good  harold paused but went on at\r\nonce  the doctor recognised that he had rightly appraised his remark\r\nand by it judged that he was a welleducated man  something in the\r\nmethod of speaking struck him and he said as nonchalantly as he could\r\n\r\nby the way which was your university\r\n\r\ncambridge  trinity  he spoke without thinking and the instant he had\r\ndone so stopped  the sense of his blindness rushed back on him  he\r\ncould not see and his ears were not yet trained to take the place of his\r\neyes  he must guard himself  thenceforward he was so cautious in his\r\nreplies that mr hilton felt convinced there was some purpose in his\r\nreticence  he therefore stopped asking questions and began to examine\r\nhim  he was unable to come to much result his opinion was shown in his\r\nreport to lady de lannoy\r\n\r\ni am unable to say anything definite as yet  the case is a most\r\ninteresting one as a case and quite apart from the splendid fellow who\r\nis the subject of it  i have hopes that within a few days i may be able\r\nto know more  i need not trouble you with surgical terms but later on\r\nif the diagnosis supports the supposition at present in my mind i shall\r\nbe able to speak more fully  in the meantime i shall with your\r\npermission wait here so that i may watch him myself\r\n\r\noh you are good  thank you  thank you said stephen  she had so\r\ntaken the man under her own care that she was grateful for any kindness\r\nshown to him\r\n\r\nnot at all said mr hilton  any man who behaved as that fellow did\r\nhas a claim on any of us who may help him  no time of mine could be\r\nbetter spent\r\n\r\nwhen he went back to the patients room he entered softly for he thought\r\nhe might be asleep  the room was according to his instructions quite\r\ndark and as it was unfamiliar to him he felt his way cautiously  harold\r\nhowever heard the small noise he made and said quietly\r\n\r\nwho is there\r\n\r\nit is i hilton\r\n\r\nare you alone\r\n\r\nyes\r\n\r\nlook round the room and see  then lock the door and come and talk to me\r\nif you will  you will pity a poor blind fellow i know  the darkness\r\nhas come down upon me so quickly that i am not accustomed to it  there\r\nwas a break in his voice which moved the other  he lit a candle feeling\r\nthat the doing so would impress his patient and went round the room not\r\nwith catlike movement this timehe wanted the other to hear him  when\r\nhe had turned the key in the lock as sharply as he could he came to the\r\nbedside and sat down  harold spoke again after a short pause\r\n\r\nis that candle still lit\r\n\r\nyes  would you like it put out\r\n\r\nif you dont mind  again i say pity me and pardon me  but i want to\r\nask you something privately between our two selves and i will feel more\r\nof equality than if you were looking at me whilst i cannot see you  mr\r\nhilton blew out the candle\r\n\r\nthere  we are equal now\r\n\r\nthank you  a long pause then he went on\r\n\r\nwhen a man becomes suddenly blind is there usually or even\r\noccasionally any sort of odd sight    does he see anything like a\r\ndream a vision\r\n\r\nnot that i know of  i have never heard of such a case  as a rule\r\npeople struck blind by lightning which is the most common cause\r\nsometimes remember with extraordinary accuracy the last thing they have\r\nseen  just as though it were photographed on the retina\r\n\r\nthank you  is such usually the recurrence of any old dream or anything\r\nthey have much thought of\r\n\r\nnot that i know of  it would be unusual  harold waited a long time\r\nbefore he spoke again  when he did so it was in a different voice a\r\nconstrained voice  the doctor accustomed to take enlightenment from\r\ntrivial details noted it\r\n\r\nnow tell me mr hilton something about what has happened  where am\r\ni\r\n\r\nin lannoy castle\r\n\r\nwhere is it\r\n\r\nin angleshire\r\n\r\nwho does it belong to\r\n\r\nlady de lannoy  the countess de lannoy they tell me she is a countess\r\nin her own right\r\n\r\nit is very good of her to have me here  is she an old lady\r\n\r\nno  a young one  young and very beautiful  after a pause before his\r\nquery\r\n\r\nwhats she like  describe her to me\r\n\r\nshe is young a little over twenty  tall and of a very fine figure  she\r\nhas eyes like black diamonds and hair like a flame  for a long time\r\nharold remained still  then he said\r\n\r\ntell me all you know or have learned of this whole affair  how was i\r\nrescued and by whom  so the doctor proceeded to give him every detail\r\nhe knew of  when he was quite through the other again lay still for a\r\nlong time  the silence was broken by a gentle tap at the door  the\r\ndoctor lit a candle  he turned the key softly so that no one would\r\nnotice that the door was locked  something was said in a low whisper\r\nthen the door was gently closed and the doctor returning said\r\n\r\nlady lannoy wants if it will not disturb you to ask how you are\r\nordinarily i should not let anyone see you  but she is not only your\r\nhostess but as i have just told you it was her ride to the headland\r\nwhere she burned the house to give you light which was the beginning of\r\nyour rescue  still if you think it better not    \r\n\r\ni hardly like anybody to see me like this said harold feebly seeking\r\nan excuse\r\n\r\nmy dear man said the other you may be easy in your mind she wont\r\nsee much of you  you are all bandages and beard  shell have to wait a\r\nwhile before she sees you\r\n\r\ndidnt she see me last night\r\n\r\nnot she  whilst we were trying to restore you she was rushing back to\r\nthe castle to see that all was ready for you and for the others from the\r\nwreck  this vaguely soothed harold\r\n\r\nif his surmise was correct and if she had not seen him then it was well\r\nthat he was bandaged now  he felt that it would not do to refuse to let\r\nher see him it might look suspicious  so after pausing a short while he\r\nsaid in a low voice\r\n\r\ni suppose she had better come now  we must not keep her waiting  when\r\nthe doctor brought her to his bedside stephen felt in a measure awed  his\r\nbandaged face and head and his great beard singed in patches looked to\r\nher in the dim light rather awesome  in a very gentle voice she said\r\nkind things to the sick man who acknowledged them in a feeble whisper\r\nthe doctor a keen observer noticed the change in his voice and\r\ndetermined to understand more  stephen spoke of his bravery and of how\r\nit was due to him that all on the ship were saved and as she spoke her\r\nemotion moved her so much that her sweet voice shook and quivered  to\r\nthe ears of the man who had now only sound to guide him it was music of\r\nthe sweetest he had ever heard  fearing lest his voice should betray\r\nhim he whispered his own thanks feebly and in few words\r\n\r\nwhen stephen went away the doctor went with her it was more than an hour\r\nbefore he returned  he found his patient in what he considered a state\r\nof suppressed excitement for though his thoughts were manifestly\r\ncollected and his words were calm he was restless and excited in other\r\nways  he had evidently been thinking of his own condition for shortly\r\nafter the doctor came in he said\r\n\r\nare we alone\r\n\r\nquite\r\n\r\ni want you to arrange that there shall not be any nurse with me\r\n\r\nmy dear sir  dont handicap me and yourself with such a restriction\r\nit is for your own good that you should have regular and constant\r\nattention\r\n\r\nbut i dont wish it  not for the present at all events  i am not\r\naccustomed to a nurse and shall not feel comfortable  in a few days\r\nperhaps      the decided tone of his voice struck the other  keeping\r\nhis own thoughts and intentions in abeyance even to himself he answered\r\nheartily\r\n\r\nall right  i shall not have any nurse at present\r\n\r\nthanks  there was relief in the tone which seemed undue and mr\r\nhilton again took mental note  presently he asked a question but in\r\nsuch a tone that the doctor pricked up his ears  there was a\r\npremeditated selfsuppression a gravity of restraint which implied some\r\nfalsity some intention other than the words conveyed\r\n\r\nit must have been a job to carry me up those stairs  the doctor was\r\ndoubting everything but as the safest attitude he stuck to literal truth\r\nso far as his words conveyed it\r\n\r\nyes  you are no light weight  to himself he mused\r\n\r\nhow did he know there were stairs  he cannot know it he was senseless\r\ntherefore he must be guessing or inquiring  harold went on\r\n\r\ni suppose the castle is on high ground  can you see far from the\r\nwindows  i suppose we are up a good height\r\n\r\nfrom the windows you can see all round the promontory  but we are not\r\nhigh up that is the room is not high from the ground though the castle\r\nis from the sea  harold asked again his voice vibrating in the note of\r\ngladness\r\n\r\nare we on the ground floor then\r\n\r\nyes\r\n\r\nand i suppose the gardens are below us\r\n\r\nyes  the answer was given quickly for a thought was floating through\r\nhim why did this strong brave man suddenly stricken blind wish to know\r\nwhether his windows were at a height  he was not surprised when his\r\npatient reaching out a hand rested it on his arm and said in an imploring\r\ntone\r\n\r\nit should be moonlight full moon two nights ago  wont you pull up the\r\nblind and describe to me all you see    tell me fully    remember\r\ni am blind\r\n\r\nthis somehow fixed the doctors thought\r\n\r\nsuicide  but i must convey the inutility of such effort by inference\r\nnot falsity\r\n\r\naccordingly he began to describe the scene from the very base of the\r\nwall where below the balcony the great border was glorious with a mass\r\nof foliage plants away to the distant sea now bathed in the flood of\r\nmoonlight  harold asked question after question the doctor replying\r\naccurately till he felt that the patient was building up a concrete idea\r\nof his surroundings near and far  then he left him  he stood for a long\r\ntime out in the passage thinking  he said to himself as he moved away\r\n\r\nthe poor fellow has some grim intention in his mind  i must not let him\r\nknow that i suspect but tonight i will watch without his knowing it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxxivwaiting\r\n\r\n\r\nmr hilton telegraphed at once countermanding for the present the nurse\r\nfor whom he had sent\r\n\r\nthat night when the household had all retired he came quietly to his\r\npatients room and entering noiselessly sat silent in a far corner\r\nthere was no artificial right the patient had to be kept in darkness\r\nthere was however a bright moonlight sufficient light stole in through\r\nthe edges of the blinds to allow him when his eyes grew accustomed to\r\nsee what might happen\r\n\r\nharold lay quite still till the house was quiet  he had been thinking\r\never since he had ascertained the identity of stephen  in his weakness\r\nand the paralysing despair of his blindness all his former grief and\r\napprehension had come bank upon him in a great wave veritably the tide\r\nof circumstances seemed to run hard against him  he had had no idea of\r\nforcing himself upon stephen and yet here he was a guest in her house\r\nwithout her knowledge or his own  she had saved his life by her energy\r\nand resource  fortunately she did not as yet know him the bandages and\r\nhis act in suppressing his voice had so far protected him  but such\r\ncould not last for long  he could not see to protect himself and take\r\nprecautions as need arose  and he knew well that stephens nature would\r\nnot allow her to be satisfied without doing all that was possible to help\r\none who had under her eyes made a great effort on behalf of others and\r\nto whom there was the added bond that his life was due to her  in but a\r\nlittle time she must find out to whom she ministered\r\n\r\nwhat then would happen  her kindness was such that when she realised the\r\nblindness of her old friend she might so pity him that out of the depths\r\nof her pity she would forgive  she would take back all the past and now\r\nthat she knew of his old love for her would perhaps be willing to marry\r\nhim  back flooded the old memory of her independence and her theory of\r\nsexual equality  if out of any selfish or mistaken idea she did not\r\nhesitate to ask a man to marry her would it be likely that when the\r\nnobler and more heroic side of her nature spoke she would hesitate to a\r\nsimilar act in pursuance of her selfsacrifice\r\n\r\nso it might be that she would either find herself once again flouted or\r\nelse married to a man she did not love\r\n\r\nsuch a catastrophe should not happen whatever the cost to him  he\r\nwould blind as he was steal away in the night and take himself out of\r\nher life this time for ever  better the ingratitude of an unknown man\r\nthe saving of whose life was due to her than the long dull routine of a\r\nspoiled life which would otherwise be her unhappy lot\r\n\r\nwhen once this idea had taken root in his mind he had taken such steps as\r\nhad been open to him without endangering the secrecy of his motive\r\nthanks to his subtle questioning of the doctor he now knew that his room\r\nwas close to the ground so that he would easily drop from the window and\r\nsteal away with out immediate danger of any restraining accident  if he\r\ncould once get away he would be all right  there was a large sum to his\r\ncredit in each of two london banks  he would manage somehow to find his\r\nway to london even if he had to walk and beg his way\r\n\r\nhe felt that now in the silence of the night the time had come  quietly\r\nhe rose and felt his way to the door now and again stumbling and\r\nknocking against unknown obstacles in the manner of the recently blind\r\nafter each such noise he paused and listened  he felt as if the very\r\nwalls had ears  when he reached the door he turned the key softly  then\r\nhe breathed more freely  he felt that he was at last alone and free to\r\nmove without suspicion\r\n\r\nthen began a great and arduous search one that was infinitely difficult\r\nand exasperating and full of pathos to the sympathetic man who watched\r\nhim in silence  mr hilton could not understand his movements as he felt\r\nhis way about the room opening drawers and armoires now and again\r\nstooping down and feeling along the floor  he did not betray his\r\npresence however but moved noiselessly away as the other approached  it\r\nwas a hideously real game of blindmansbuff with perhaps a life as the\r\nforfeit\r\n\r\nharold went all over the room and at last sat down on the edge of his\r\nbed with a hollow suppressed groan that was full of pain  he had found\r\nhis clothes but realised that they were now but rags  he put on the\r\nclothes and then for a long time sat quiet rocking gently to and fro as\r\none in pain a figure of infinite woe  at last he roused himself  his\r\nmind was made up the time for action had come  he groped his way\r\ntowards the window looking south  the doctor who had taken off his\r\nshoes followed him with catlike stealthiness\r\n\r\nhe easily threw open the window for it was already partly open for\r\nventilation\r\n\r\nwhen mr hilton saw him sit on the rail of the balcony and begin to raise\r\nhis feet getting ready to drop over he rushed forward and seized him\r\nharold instinctively grappled with him the habit of his alaskan life\r\namidst continual danger made in such a case action swift as thought  mr\r\nhilton with the single desire to prevent him from killing himself threw\r\nhimself backward and pulled harold with him to the stone floor\r\n\r\nharold as he held him in a grip of iron thundered out forgetful in the\r\nexcitement of the moment the hushed voice to which he had limited\r\nhimself\r\n\r\nwhat do you want who are you\r\n\r\nhsssh  i am mr hilton  harold relaxed the rigour of his grasp but\r\nstill held him firmly\r\n\r\nhow did you come here  i locked my door\r\n\r\ni have been in the room a long time  i suspected something and came to\r\nwatch to prevent your rash act\r\n\r\nrash act  how\r\n\r\nwhy man if you didnt kill you would at least cripple yourself\r\n\r\nhow can i cripple myself when the flowerbed is only a few feet below\r\n\r\nthere are other dangers for a man whoa man in your sad state  and\r\nbesides have i no duty to prevent a suicide  here a brilliant idea\r\nstruck harold  this man had evidently got some wrong impression but it\r\nwould serve to shield his real purpose  he would therefore encourage it\r\nfor the moment of course his purpose to escape unnoticed was foiled\r\nbut he would wait and in due time seize another opportunity  in a\r\nharder and more determined tone than he had yet used he said\r\n\r\ni dont see what right you have to interfere  i shall kill myself if i\r\nlike\r\n\r\nnot whilst you are in my care  this was spoken with a resolution equal\r\nto his own  then mr hilton went on more softly and with infinite\r\ncompassion moreover i want to have a talk with you which may alter\r\nyour views  harold interrupted still playing the game of hiding his\r\nreal purpose\r\n\r\ni shall do as i wish as i intend\r\n\r\nyou are injuring yourself even now by standing in the draught of that\r\nopen window  your eyes will feel it before long    are you mad   \r\n\r\n\r\nharold felt a prick like a pin in his neck and turned to seize his\r\ncompanion  he could not find him and for a few moments stumbled through\r\nthe dark raging   \r\n\r\nit seemed a long time before he remembered anything  he had a sense of\r\ntime lapsed of dreamland thoughts and visions  then gradually\r\nrecollection came back  he tried to move but found it impossible  his\r\narms and legs were extended wide and were tied he could feel the cord\r\nhurting his wrists and ankles as he moved  to him it was awful to be\r\nthus blind and helpless and anger began to surge up  he heard the voice\r\nof mr hilton close by him speaking in a calm grave sympathetic tone\r\n\r\nmy poor fellow i hated to take such a step but it was really necessary\r\nfor your own safety  you are a man and a brave one  wont you listen\r\nto me for a few minutes  when you have heard what i have to say i shall\r\nrelease you  in the meantime i apologise for the outrage as i dare say\r\nyou consider it  harold was reasonable and he was now blind and\r\nhelpless  moreover there was something in the doctors voice that\r\ncarried a sense of power with it\r\n\r\ngo on i shall listen  he compelled himself to quietude  the doctor\r\nsaw and realised that he was master of himself  there were some snips\r\nof scissors and he was free\r\n\r\nsee all i want is calm for a short time and you have it  may i go\r\non\r\n\r\ngo on said harold not without respect  the doctor after a pause\r\nspoke\r\n\r\nmy poor fellow i want you to understand that i wish to help you to do\r\nall in my power to restore to you that which you seem to have lost  i\r\ncan sympathise with your desire to quit life altogether now that the best\r\npart of it sight seems gone  i do not pretend to judge the actions of\r\nmy fellows and if you determine to carry out your purpose i shall not be\r\nable to prevent you for ever  i shall not try to  but you certainly\r\nshall not do so till you know what i know  i had wished to wait till i\r\ncould be a little more certain before i took you into confidence with\r\nregard to my guessing as to the future  but your desire to destroy\r\nyourself forces my hand  now let me tell you that there is a possibility\r\nof the removal of the cause of your purpose\r\n\r\nwhat do you mean gasped harold  he was afraid to think outright and\r\nto the full what the others words seemed to imply\r\n\r\ni mean said the other solemnly that there is a possibility more\r\nthan a possibility that you may recover your sight  as he spoke there\r\nwas a little break in his voice  he too was somewhat unnerved at the\r\nsituation\r\n\r\nharold lay still  the whole universe seemed to sway and then whirl\r\nround him in chaotic mass  through it at length he seemed to hear the\r\ncalm voice\r\n\r\nat first i could not be sure of my surmise for when i used the\r\nophthalmoscope your suffering was too recent to disclose the cause i\r\nlooked for  now i am fairly sure of it  what i have since heard from\r\nyou has convinced me your having suffered from rheumatic fever and the\r\nrecrudescence of the rheumatic pain after your terrible experience of the\r\nfire and that long chilling swim with so seemingly hopeless an end to it\r\nthe symptoms which i have since noticed though they have not been as\r\nenlightening to me as they might be  your disease as i have diagnosed\r\nit is an obscure one and not common  i have not before been able to\r\nstudy a case  all these things give me great hopes\r\n\r\nthank god  thank god the voice from the bed was now a whisper\r\n\r\nthank god say i too  this that you suffer from is an acute form of\r\ninflammation of the optic nerve  it may of course end badly in\r\npermanent loss of sight  but i hopei believe that in your case it\r\nwill not be so  you are young and you are immensely strong not merely\r\nmuscularly but in constitution  i can see that you have been an\r\nathlete and no mean one either  all this will stand to you  but it\r\nwill take time  it will need all your own help all the calm restraint\r\nof your body and your mind  i am doing all that science knows you must\r\ndo the rest  he waited giving time to the other to realise his ideas\r\nharold lay still for a long time before he spoke\r\n\r\ndoctor  the voice was so strangely different that the other was more\r\nhopeful at once  he had feared opposition or conflict of some kind  he\r\nanswered as cheerily as he could\r\n\r\nyes  i am listening\r\n\r\nyou are a good fellow and i am grateful to you both for what you have\r\ndone and what you have told me  i cannot say how grateful just yet hope\r\nunmans me at present  but i think you deserve that i should tell you the\r\ntruth  the other nodded he forgot that the speaker could not see\r\n\r\ni was not intending to commit suicide  such an idea didnt even enter\r\nmy head  to me suicide is the resource of a coward  i have been in too\r\nmany tight places to ever fear that\r\n\r\nthen in the name of goodness why were you trying to get out of that\r\nwindow\r\n\r\ni wanted to escape to get away\r\n\r\nin your shirt and trousers and they are not over much  without even\r\nslippers  a faint smile curled round the lips of the injured man  hope\r\nwas beginning to help already\r\n\r\neven that way\r\n\r\nbut man alive you were going to your death  how could you expect to\r\nget away in such an outfit without being discovered  when you were\r\nmissed the whole countryside would have been up and even before the hue\r\nandcry the first person who saw you would have taken charge of you\r\n\r\ni know  i know  i had thought of it all  but i was willing to chance\r\nit  i had my own reasons  he was silent a while  the doctor was\r\nsilent too  each man was thinking in his own way  presently the doctor\r\nspoke\r\n\r\nlook here old chap  i dont want to pry into your secrets but wont\r\nyou let me help you  i can hold my tongue  i want to help you  you\r\nhave earned that wish from any man and woman too who saw the burning\r\nship and what you did to save those on board  there is nothing i would\r\nnot do for you  nothing  i dont ask you to tell me all only enough\r\nfor me to understand and help  i can see that you have some overpowering\r\nwish to get away  some reason that i cannot fathom certainly without a\r\nclue  you may trust me i assure you  if you could look into my face\r\nmy eyes you would understand  butthere take my hand  it may tell\r\nyou something\r\n\r\nharold took the hand placed in his and held it close  he pressed his\r\nother hand over it also as though the effect of the two hands would\r\nbring him double knowledge  it was infinitely pathetic to see him trying\r\nto make his untrained fingers do the duty of his trained eyes  but\r\ntrained or not his hands had their instinct  laying down gently the\r\nhand he held he said turning his bandaged eyes in the direction of his\r\ncompanion\r\n\r\ni shall trust you  are we alone absolutely alone\r\n\r\nabsolutely\r\n\r\nhave i your solemn promise that anything i say shall never go beyond\r\nyourself\r\n\r\ni promise  i can swear if it will make your mind more easy in the\r\nmatter\r\n\r\nwhat do you hold most sacred in the world  harold had an odd thought\r\nhis question was its result\r\n\r\nall told i should think my profession  perhaps it doesnt seem to you\r\nmuch to swear by but it is all my world  but i have been brought up in\r\nhonour and you may trust my promiseas much as anything i could swear\r\n\r\nall right  my reason for wanting to get away was because i knew lady de\r\nlannoy\r\n\r\nwhat  then after a pause i should have thought that was a reason for\r\nwanting to stay  she seems not only one of the most beautiful but the\r\nsweetest woman i ever met\r\n\r\nshe is all that  and a thousand times more\r\n\r\nthen whypardon me\r\n\r\ni cannot tell you all but you must take it that my need to get away is\r\nimperative  after pondering a while mr hilton said suddenly\r\n\r\ni must ask your pardon again  are you sure there is no mistake  lady\r\nde lannoy is not married has not been  she is countess in her own\r\nright  it is quite a romance  she inherited from some old branch of\r\nmore than three hundred years ago  again harold smiled he quite saw\r\nwhat the other meant\r\n\r\nhe answered gravely\r\n\r\ni understand  but it does not alter my opinion my purpose  it is\r\nneedfulabsolutely and imperatively needful that i get away without her\r\nrecognising me or knowing who i am\r\n\r\nshe does not know you now  she has not seen you yet\r\n\r\nthat is why i hoped to get away in time before she should recognise me\r\nif i stay quiet and do all you wish will you help me\r\n\r\ni will  and what then\r\n\r\nwhen i am well if it should be so i shall steal away this time\r\nclothed and disappear out of her life without her knowing  she may\r\nthink it ungrateful that one whom she has treated so well should behave\r\nso badly  but that cant be helped  it is the lesser evil of the two\r\n\r\nand i must abet you  all right  i will do it though you must forgive\r\nme if you should ever hear that i have abused you and said bad things of\r\nyou  it will have to be all in the days work if i am not ultimately to\r\ngive you away  i must take steps at once to keep her from seeing you  i\r\nshall have to invent some story some new kind of dangerous disease\r\nperhaps  i shall stay here and nurse you myself  harold spoke in\r\njoyful gratitude\r\n\r\noh you are good  but can you spare the time  how long will it all\r\ntake\r\n\r\nsome weeks  perhaps  he paused as if thinking  perhaps in a months\r\ntime i shall unbandage your eyes  you will then see or    \r\n\r\ni understand  i shall be patient\r\n\r\nin the morning mr hilton in reporting to lady de lannoy told her that he\r\nconsidered it would be necessary to keep his patient very quiet both in\r\nmind and body  in the course of the conversation he said\r\n\r\nanything which might upset him must be studiously avoided  he is not an\r\neasy patient to deal with he doesnt like people to go near him  i\r\nthink therefore it will be well if even you do not see him  he seems\r\nto have an odd distrust of people especially of women  it may be that\r\nhe is fretful in his blindness which is in itself so trying to a strong\r\nman  but besides the treatment is not calculated to have a very buoyant\r\neffect  it is apt to make a man fretful to lie in the dark and know\r\nthat he has to do so for indefinite weeks  pilocarpin and salicylate of\r\nsoda and mercury do not tend towards cheerfulness  nor do blisters on\r\nthe forehead add to the content of life\r\n\r\ni quite understand said stephen and i will be careful not to go near\r\nhim till he is well  please god it may bring him back his sight  thank\r\nyou a thousand times for your determination to stay with him\r\n\r\nso it was that for more than two weeks harold was kept all alone  no one\r\nattended him but the doctor  he slept in the patients room for the\r\nwhole of the first week and never had him out of sight for more than a\r\nfew minutes at a time  he was then able to leave him alone for longer\r\nperiods and settled himself in the bedroom next to him  every hour or\r\ntwo he would visit him  occasionally he would be away for half a day\r\nbut never for more  stephen rigidly observed the doctors advice\r\nherself and gave strict orders that his instructions were to be obeyed\r\n\r\nharold himself went through a period of mental suffering  it was agony\r\nto him to think of stephen being so near at hand and yet not to be able\r\nto see her or even to hear her voice  all the pain of his loss of her\r\naffection seemed to crowd back on him and with it the new need of\r\nescaping from her unknown  more than ever he felt it would not do that\r\nshe should ever learn his identity  her pity for him and possibly her\r\nwomans regard for a mans effort in time of stress might lead through\r\nthe gates of her own selfsacrifice to his restoration to his old place\r\nin her affections  nay it could not be his old place for at the close\r\nof those days she had learned of his love for her\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxxva cry\r\n\r\n\r\nthe third week had nearly elapsed and as yet no one was allowed to see\r\nthe patient\r\n\r\nfor a time stephen was inclined to be chagrined  it is not pleasant to\r\nhave even the most generous and benevolent intentions thwarted and she\r\nhad set her mind on making much of this man whom fate and his own bravery\r\nhad thrown athwart her life  but in these days stephen was in some ways\r\na changed woman  she had so much that she wished to forget and that she\r\nwould have given worlds to recall that she could not bear even to think\r\nof any militant or even questioning attitude  she even began to take\r\nherself to task more seriously than she had ever done with regard to\r\nsocial and conventional duties  when she found her house full of so many\r\nand so varied guests it was borne in upon her that such a position as\r\nher own with such consequent duties called for the presence of some\r\nelder person of her own sex and of her own class\r\n\r\nno better proof of stephens intellectual process and its result could be\r\nadduced than her first act of recognition she summoned an elderly lady\r\nto live with her and matronise her house  this lady the widow of a\r\ndistant relation complied with all the charted requirements of\r\nrespectability and had what to stephens eyes was a positive gift that\r\nof minding her own business and not interfering in any matter whatever\r\nlady de lannoy she felt was her own master and quite able to take care\r\nof herself  her own presence was all that convention required  so she\r\nlimited herself to this duty with admirable result to all herself\r\nincluded  after a few days stephen would almost forget that she was\r\npresent\r\n\r\nmr hilton kept bravely to his undertaking  he never gave even a hint of\r\nhis hopes of the restoration of sight and he was so assiduous in his\r\nattention that there arose no opportunity of accidental discovery of the\r\nsecret  he knew that when the time did come he would find himself in a\r\nvery unpleasant situation  want of confidence and even of intentional\r\ndeceit might be attributed to him and he would not be able to deny nor\r\nexplain  he was however determined to stick to his word  if he could\r\nbut save his patients sight he would be satisfied\r\n\r\nbut to stephen all the mystery seemed to grow out of its first shadowy\r\nimportance into something real  there was coming to her a vague idea\r\nthat she would do well not to manifest any concern any anxiety any\r\ncuriosity  instinct was at work she was content to trust it and wait\r\n\r\none forenoon she received by messenger a letter which interested her\r\nmuch  so much that at first she was unwilling to show it to anyone and\r\ntook it to her own boudoir to read over again in privacy  she had a sort\r\nof feeling of expectancy with regard to it such as sensitive natures\r\nfeel before a thunderstorm  the letter was natural enough in itself  it\r\nwas dated that morning from varilands a neighbouring estate which\r\nmarched with lannoy to the south\r\n\r\n   my dear madamwill you pardon me a great liberty and allow my\r\n   little girl and me to come to see you today  i shall explain when we\r\n   meet  when i say that we are americans and have come seven thousand\r\n   miles for the purpose you will i am sure understand that it is no\r\n   common interest which has brought us and it will be the excuse for\r\n   our eagerness  i should write you more fully but as the matter is a\r\n   confidential one i thought it would be better to speak  we shall be\r\n   doubly grateful if you will have the kindness to see us alone  i\r\n   write as a mother in making this appeal to your kindness for my\r\n   childshe is only a little over eight years oldhas the matter so\r\n   deeply in her heart that any disappointment or undue delay would i\r\n   fear affect her health  we presume to take your kindness for granted\r\n   and will call a little before twelve oclock\r\n\r\n   i may perhaps say in case you should feel any hesitation as to my\r\n   bona fides that my husband purchased some years ago this estate  we\r\n   were to have come here to live in the early summer but were kept in\r\n   the west by some important business of his\r\n\r\n   believe me yours sincerely\r\n   alice stonehouse\r\n\r\nstephen had of course no hesitation as to receiving the lady  even had\r\nthere been objection the curiosity she had in common with her kind would\r\nhave swept difficulties aside  she gave orders that when mrs stonehouse\r\narrived with her daughter they were to be shown at once into the mandarin\r\ndrawingroom  that they would probably stay for lunch  she would see\r\nthem alone\r\n\r\na little before twelve oclock mrs stonehouse and pearl arrived and\r\nwere shown into the room where lady de lannoy awaited them  the high\r\nsun streaming in from the side shone on her beautiful hair making it\r\nlook like living gold  when the americans came in they were for an\r\ninstant entranced by her beauty  one glance at mrs stonehouses sweet\r\nsympathetic face was enough to establish her in stephens good graces\r\nforever  as for pearl she was like one who has unexpectedly seen a\r\nfairy or a goddess  she had been keeping guardedly behind her mother\r\nbut on the instant she came out fearlessly into the open\r\n\r\nstephen advanced quickly and shook hands with mrs stonehouse saying\r\nheartily\r\n\r\ni am so glad you have come  i am honoured in being trusted\r\n\r\nthank you so much lady de lannoy  i felt that you would not mind\r\nespecially when you know why we came  indeed i had no choice  pearl\r\ninsisted on it and when pearl is urgentwe who love her have all to\r\ngive way  this is pearl\r\n\r\nin an instant stephen was on her knees by the beautiful child\r\n\r\nthe red rosebud of a mouth was raised to her kiss and the little arms\r\nwent lovingly round her neck and clung to her  as the mother looked on\r\ndelighted she thought she had never seen a more beautiful sight  the two\r\nfaces so different and yet with so much in common  the red hair and the\r\nflaxen both tints of gold  the fine colour of each heightened to a\r\nbright flush in their eagerness  stephen was so little used to children\r\nand yet loved them so that all the womanhood in her which is possible\r\nmotherhood went out in an instant to the lovely eager child  she felt\r\nthe keenest pleasure when the little thing having rubbed her silkgloved\r\npalms over her face and then holding her away so that she could see her\r\nmany beauties whispered in her ear\r\n\r\nhow pretty you are\r\n\r\nyou darling whispered stephen in reply  we must love each other very\r\nmuch you and i\r\n\r\nwhen the two ladies had sat down stephen holding pearl in her lap mrs\r\nstonehouse said\r\n\r\ni suppose you have wondered lady de lannoy what has brought us here\r\n\r\nindeed i was very much interested\r\n\r\nthen i had better tell you all from the beginning so that you may\r\nunderstand  she proceeded to give the details of the meeting with mr\r\nrobinson on the scoriac  of how pearl took to him and insisted on\r\nmaking him her special friend of the terrible incident of her being\r\nswept overboard and of the gallant rescue  mrs stonehouse was much\r\nmoved as she spoke  all that fearful time of which the minutes had\r\nseemed years of agony came back to her so vividly at times that she\r\ncould hardly speak  pearl listened too all eagerness but without fear\r\nstephen was greatly moved and held pearl close to her all the time as\r\nthough protecting her  when the mother spoke of her feeling when she saw\r\nthe brave man struggling up and down the giant waves and now and again\r\nlosing sight of him in the trough of the sea she put out one hand and\r\nheld the mothers with a grasp which vibrated in sympathy whilst the\r\ngreat tears welled over in her eyes and ran down her cheeks  pearl\r\nwatching her keenly said nothing but taking her tiny cambric\r\nhandkerchief from her pocket silently wiped the tears away and clung all\r\nthe tighter  it was her turn to protect now\r\n\r\npearls own time for tears came when her mother began to tell this new\r\nand sympathetic friend of how she became so much attached to her rescuer\r\nthat when she knew he would not be coming to the west with them but\r\ngoing off to the wildest region of the far north her health became\r\nimpaired and that it was only when mr robinson promised to come back to\r\nsee her within three years that she was at all comforted  and how ever\r\nsince she had held the man in her heart and thought of him every day\r\nsleeping as well as waking for he was a factor in her dreams\r\n\r\nstephen was more than ever moved for the childs constancy touched her\r\nas well as her grief  she strained the little thing in her strong young\r\narms as though the fervency of her grasp would bring belief and comfort\r\nas it did  she in her turn dried the others eyes  then mrs stonehouse\r\nwent on with her story\r\n\r\nwe were at banff high up in the rockies when we read of the burning\r\nand wrecking of the dominion  it is as you know a montreal boat of\r\nthe allan line so that naturally there was a full telegraphic report in\r\nall the canadian papers  when we read of the brave man who swam ashore\r\nwith the line and who was unable to reach the port but swam out across\r\nthe bay pearl took it for granted that it must have been the man as\r\nshe always called mr robinson  when by the next paper we learned that\r\nthe mans name was robinson nothing would convince her that it was not\r\nher mr robinson  my husband i may tell you had firmly come to the\r\nsame conclusion  he had ever since the rescue of our child always looked\r\nfor any news from alaska whither he knew mr robinson had gone  he\r\nlearned that up away in the very far north a new goldfield had been\r\ndiscovered by a man of the same name and that a new town robinson city\r\nbegan to grow up in the wilderness where the condition of life from the\r\ncold was a new experience to even the most hardy gold miners  then we\r\nbegan to think that the young hero who had so gallantly saved our darling\r\nwas meeting some of his reward    \r\n\r\nshe paused her voice breaking  stephen was in a glow of holy feeling\r\ngladness joy gratitude enthusiasm she knew not which  it all seemed\r\nlike a noble dream which was coming true  mrs stonehouse went on\r\n\r\nfrom californian papers of last month we learned that robinson of\r\nrobinson city had sailed for san francisco but had disappeared when the\r\nship touched at portland and then the whole chain of his identity seemed\r\ncomplete  nothing would satisfy pearl but that we should come at once to\r\nengland and see the man who was wounded and blind and do what we\r\ncould for him  her father could not then come himself he had important\r\nwork on hand which he could not leave without some preparation  but he\r\nis following us and may be here at any time\r\n\r\nand now we want you to help us lady de lannoy  we are not sure yet of\r\nthe identity of mr robinson but we shall know the instant we see him\r\nor hear his voice  we have learned that he is still here  wont you let\r\nus  do let us see him as soon as ever you can  there was a pleading\r\ntone in her voice which alone would have moved stephen even had she not\r\nbeen wrought up already by the glowing fervour of her new friend\r\n\r\nbut she paused  she did not know what to say how to tell them that as\r\nyet she herself knew nothing  she too in the depths of her own heart\r\nknewknewthat it was the same robinson  and she also knew that both\r\nidentities were one with another  the beating of her heart and the wild\r\nsurging of her blood told her all  she was afraid to speak lest her\r\nvoice should betray her\r\n\r\nshe could not even think  she would have to be alone for that\r\n\r\nmrs stonehouse with the wisdom and power of age waited suspending\r\njudgment  but pearl was in a fever of anxiety she could imagine nothing\r\nwhich could keep her away from the man  but she saw that there was some\r\ndifficulty some cause of delay  so she too added her pleading  putting\r\nher mouth close to lady de lannoys ear she whispered very faintly very\r\ncaressingly\r\n\r\nwhat is your name  your own name  your very own name\r\n\r\nstephen my darling\r\n\r\noh wont you let us see the man stephen dear stephen  i love him so\r\nand i do so want to see him  it is ages till i see him  wont you let\r\nme  i shall be so goodstephen  and she strained her closer in her\r\nlittle arms and kissed her all over face cheeks and forehead and eyes\r\nand mouth wooingly  stephen returned the embrace and the kisses but\r\nremained silent a little longer  then she found voice\r\n\r\ni hardly know what to say  believe me i shouldi shall do all i can\r\nbut the fact is that i am not in authority  the doctor has taken him in\r\ncharge and will not let anyone go near him he will not even have a\r\nnurse but watches and attends to him himself  he says it might be fatal\r\nif anything should occur to agitate him  why even i am not allowed to\r\nsee him\r\n\r\nhavent you seen him yet at all ever ever stephen asked pearl all\r\nher timidity gone  stephen smileda wan smile it was as she answered\r\n\r\ni saw him in the water but it was too far away to distinguish  and it\r\nwas only by firelight\r\n\r\noh yes i know said pearl mother and daddy told me how you had\r\nburned the house down to give him light  didnt you want to see him more\r\nafter that  i should  stephen drew the impulsive child closer as she\r\nanswered\r\n\r\nindeed i did dear  but i had to think of what was good for him  i\r\nwent to his room the next day when he was awake and the doctor let me\r\ncome in for only a moment\r\n\r\nwell  what did you see  didnt you know him  she forgot that the\r\nother did not know him from her point of view  but the question went\r\nthrough stephens heart like a sword  what would she not have given to\r\nhave known him  what would she not give to know him now    she spoke\r\nmechanically\r\n\r\nthe room was quite dark  it is necessary the doctor says that he be\r\nkept in the dark  i saw only a big beard partly burned away by the\r\nfire and a great bandage which covered his eyes  pearls hold relaxed\r\nshe slipped like an eel to the floor and ran over to her mother  her new\r\nfriend was all very well but no one would do as well as mother when she\r\nwas in trouble\r\n\r\noh mother mother  my robinson had no beard  her mother stroked her\r\nface comfortingly as she answered\r\n\r\nbut my dear it is more than two years since you saw him  two years\r\nand three months for it was in june that we crossed  how the date\r\nthrilled stephen  it verified her assumption\r\n\r\nmrs stonehouse did not notice but went on\r\n\r\nhis beard would have grown  men wear beards up in the cold place where\r\nhe was  pearl kissed her there was no need for words  throwing\r\nherself again on stephens knees she went on with her questioning\r\n\r\nbut didnt you hear him\r\n\r\ni heard very little darling  he was very weak  it was only the\r\nmorning after the wreck and he spoke in a whisper  then with an\r\ninstinct of selfpreservation she added but how could i learn anything\r\nby hearing him when he was a stranger to me  i had never even heard of\r\nmr robinson\r\n\r\nas she was speaking she found her own ideas the proofs of her own\r\nconviction growing  this was surely another link in the chain of proving\r\nthat all three men were but one  but in such case harold must know must\r\nhave tried to hide his identity\r\n\r\nshe feared with keen eyes upon her to pursue the thought  but her\r\nblood began to grow cold and her brain to swim  with an effort she went\r\non\r\n\r\neven since then i have not been allowed to go near him  of course i\r\nmust obey orders  i am waiting as patiently as i can  but we must ask\r\nthe doctor if he thinks his patient will see youwill let you see\r\nhimthough he will not let me  this she added with a touch of what she\r\nfelt regret rather than bitter ness  there was no room for bitterness\r\nin her full heart where harold was concerned\r\n\r\nwill you ask the doctor now  pearl did not let grass grow under her\r\nfeet  for answer stephen rang the bell and when a servant appeared\r\nasked\r\n\r\nis mr hilton in the house\r\n\r\ni think not your ladyship  he said he was going over to port lannoch\r\nshall i inquire if he left word at what time he would be back\r\n\r\nif you please  the man returned in a few minutes with the butler who\r\nsaid\r\n\r\nmr hilton said your ladyship that he expected to be back by one\r\noclock at latest\r\n\r\nplease ask him on his arrival if he will kindly come here at once  do\r\nnot let us be disturbed until then  the butler bowed and withdrew\r\n\r\nnow said stephen as we have to wait till our tyrant comes wont you\r\ntell me all that went on after the man had left you  pearl brightened\r\nup at once  stephen would have given anything to get away even for a\r\nwhile  beliefs and hopes and fears were surging up till she felt\r\nchoking  but the habit of her life especially her life of the last two\r\nyears gave her selfcontrol  and so she waited trying with all her\r\nmight to follow the childs prattle\r\n\r\nafter a long wait pearl exclaimed oh  i do wish that doctor would\r\ncome  i want to see the man  she was so restless marching about the\r\nroom that stephen said\r\n\r\nwould you like to go out on the balcony darling of course if mother\r\nwill let you  it is quite safe i assure you mrs stonehouse  it is\r\nwide and open and is just above the flowerborders with a stone tail\r\nyou can see the road from it by which mr hilton comes from port lannoch\r\nhe will be riding  pearl yielded at once to the diversion  it would at\r\nany rate be something to do to watch  stephen opened the french window\r\nand the child ran out on the balcony\r\n\r\nwhen stephen came back to her seat mrs stonehouse said quietly\r\n\r\ni am glad she is away for a few minutes  she has been over wrought and\r\ni am always afraid for her  she is so sensitive  and after all she is\r\nonly a baby\r\n\r\nshe is a darling said stephen impulsively and she meant it  mrs\r\nstonehouse smiled gratefully as she went on\r\n\r\ni suppose you noticed what a hold on her imagination that episode of\r\nmollie watford at the bank had  mr stonehouse is as perhaps you know\r\na very rich man  he has made his fortune himself and most honourably\r\nand we are all very proud of him and of it  so pearl does not think of\r\nthe money for itself  but the feeling was everything she really loves\r\nmr robinson as indeed she ought  he has done so much for us that it\r\nwould be a pride and a privilege for us to show our gratitude  my\r\nhusband between ourselves wanted to make him his partner  he tells me\r\nthat quite independent of our feeling towards him he is just the man he\r\nwanted  and if indeed it was he who discovered the alaskan goldfield and\r\norganised and ruled robinson city it is a proof that mr stonehouses\r\njudgment was sound  now he is injured and blind and our little pearl\r\nloves him  if indeed he be the man we believe he is then we may be able\r\nto do something which all his millions cannot buy  he will come to us\r\nand be as a son to us and a brother to pearl  we will be his eyes and\r\nnothing but love and patience will guide his footsteps  she paused her\r\nmouth quivering then she went on\r\n\r\nif it is not our mr robinson then it will be our pleasure to do all\r\nthat is necessary for his comfort  if he is a poor man he will never\r\nwant    it will be a privilege to save so gallant a man from hardship\r\n     here she came to a stop\r\n\r\nstephen too was glad of the pause for the emotion which the words and\r\ntheir remembrances evoked was choking her  had not harold been as her\r\nown fathers son  as her own brother    she turned away fearing\r\nlest her face should betray her\r\n\r\nall at once mrs stonehouse started to her feet her face suddenly white\r\nwith fear for a cry had come to their ears  a cry which even stephen\r\nknew as pearls  the mother ran to the window\r\n\r\nthe balcony was empty  she came back into the room and ran to the\r\ndoor\r\n\r\nbut on the instant a voice that both women knew was heard from without\r\n\r\nhelp there  help i say  the child has fainted  is there no one\r\nthere  and i am blind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxxvilight\r\n\r\n\r\nharold had been in a state of increasing restlessness  the month of\r\nwaiting which dr hilton had laid down for him seemed to wear away with\r\nextraordinary slowness this was increased by the lack of companionship\r\nand further by the cutting off of even the little episodes usual to daily\r\nlife  his patience great as it was naturally and trained as it had been\r\nby the years of selfrepression was beginning to give way  often and\r\noften there came over him a wild desire to tear off the irksome bandages\r\nand try for himself whether the hopes held out to him were being even\r\npartially justified  he was restrained only by the fear of perpetual\r\nblindness which came over him in a sort of cold wave at each reaction\r\ntime too added to his fear of discovery but he could not but think\r\nthat his selfsought isolation must be a challenge to the curiosity of\r\neach and all who knew of it  and with all these disturbing causes came\r\nthe main one which never lessened but always grew that whatever might\r\nhappen stephen would be further from him than ever  look at the matter\r\nhow he would turn it round in whatsoever possible or impossible way he\r\ncould see no relief to this gloomy conclusion\r\n\r\nfor it is in the nature of love that it creates or enlarges its own pain\r\nif troubles or difficulties there be from natural causes then it will\r\nexaggerate them into nightmare proportions  but if there be none it\r\nwill create them  love is in fact the most serious thing that comes to\r\nman where it exists all else seem as phantoms or at best as actualities\r\nof lesser degree  during the better part of two years his troubles had\r\nbut slept and as nothing wakes the pangs of old love better than the\r\nsound of a voice all the old acute pain of love and the agony that\r\nfollowed its denial were back with him  surely he could never never\r\nbelieve that stephen did not mean what she had said to him that morning\r\nin the beech grove  all his new resolution not to hamper her with the\r\nburden of a blind and lonelyhearted man was back to the full\r\n\r\nin such mood had he been that morning  he was additionally disturbed\r\nbecause the doctor had gone early to port lannoch and as he was the only\r\nperson with whom he could talk he clung to him with something of the\r\nhelpless feeling of a frightened child to its nurse\r\n\r\nthe day being full of sunshine the window was open and only the dark\r\ngreen blind which crackled and rustled with every passing breeze made the\r\ndarkness of the room  harold was dressed and lay on a sofa placed back\r\nin the room where the few rays of light thus entering could not reach\r\nhim  his eyes and forehead were bandaged as ever  for some days the\r\ndoctor who had his own reasons and his own purpose had not taken them\r\noff so the feeling of blind helplessness was doubly upon him  he knew\r\nhe was blind and he knew also that if he were not he could not in his\r\npresent condition see\r\n\r\nall at once he started up awake  his hearing had in the weeks of\r\ndarkness grown abnormally acute and some trifling sound had recalled him\r\nto himself  it might have been inspiration but he seemed to be\r\nconscious of some presence in the room\r\n\r\nas he rose from the sofa with the violent motion of a strong man\r\nstartled into unconscious activity he sent a shock of fear to the eager\r\nchild who had strayed into the room through the open window  had he\r\npresented a normal appearance she would not have been frightened  she\r\nwould have recognised his identity despite the changes and have sprung\r\nto him so impulsively that she would have been in his arms before she had\r\ntime to think  but now all she saw was a great beard topped with a mass\r\nof linen and lint which obscured all the rest of the face and seemed in\r\nthe gloom like a gigantic and ominous turban\r\n\r\nin her fright she screamed out  he in turn forgetful for the moment of\r\nhis intention of silence called aloud\r\n\r\nwho is that  pearl who had been instinctively backing towards the\r\nwindow by which she had entered and whose thoughts in her fright had\r\ngone back to her motherrefuge in time of dangercried out\r\n\r\nmother mother  it is him  it is the man  she would have run towards\r\nhim in spite of his forbidding appearance but the shock had been too\r\nmuch for her  the little knees trembled and gave way the brain reeled\r\nand with a moan she sank on the floor in a swoon\r\n\r\nharold knew the voice the instant she spoke there was no need for the\r\nenlightening words\r\n\r\npearl  pearl he cried  come to me darling  but as he spoke he\r\nheard her moan and the soft thud of her little body on the thick carpet\r\nhe guessed the truth and groped his way towards where the sound had been\r\nfor he feared lest he might trample upon her in too great eagerness\r\nkneeling by her he touched her little feet and then felt his way to her\r\nface  and as he did so such is the double action of the mind even in\r\nthe midst of his care the remembrance swept across his mind of how he had\r\nonce knelt in just such manner in an old church by another little\r\nsenseless form  in his confusion of mind he lost the direction of the\r\ndoor and coming to the window pushed forward the flapping blind and went\r\nout on the balcony  he knew from the freshness of the air and the\r\ndistant sounds that he was in the open  this disturbed him as he wished\r\nto find someone who could attend to the fainting child  but as he had\r\nlost the way back to the room now he groped along the wall of the castle\r\nwith one hand whilst he held pearl securely in the other  as he went he\r\ncalled out for help\r\n\r\nwhen he came opposite the window of the mandarin room mrs stonehouse saw\r\nhim she ran to him and caught pearl in her arms  she was so agitated\r\nso lost in concern for the child that she never even thought to speak to\r\nthe man whom she had come so far to seek  she wailed over the child\r\n\r\npearl  pearl  what is it darling  it is mother  she laid the girl\r\non the sofa and taking the flowers out of a glass began to sprinkle\r\nwater on the childs face  harold knew her voice and waited in patience\r\npresently the child sighed the mother relieved thought of other things\r\nat last and looked around her\r\n\r\nthere was yet another trouble  there on the floor where she had slipped\r\ndown lay lady de lannoy in a swoon  she called out instinctively\r\nforgetting for the moment that the man was blind but feeling all the old\r\nconfidence which he had won in her heart\r\n\r\noh  mr robinson help me  lady de lannoy has fainted too and i do\r\nnot know what to do  as she spoke she looked up at him and remembered\r\nhis blindness  but she had no time to alter her words the instant she\r\nhad spoken harold who had been leaning against the windowsash and\r\nwhose mind was calmer since with his acute hearing he too had heard pearl\r\nsigh seemed to leap into the room\r\n\r\nwhere is she  where is she  oh god now am i blind indeed\r\n\r\nit gave her a pang to hear him and to see him turn helplessly with his\r\narms and hands outstretched as though he would feel for her in the air\r\n\r\nwithout pause and under an instinctive and uncontrollable impulse he\r\ntore the bandages from his eyes  the sun was streaming in  as he met it\r\nhis eyes blinked and a cry burst from him a wild cry whose joy and\r\nsurprise pierced even through the shut portals of the swooning womans\r\nbrain  not for worlds would she ever after have lost the memory of that\r\nsound\r\n\r\nlight light  oh god  oh god  i am not blind\r\n\r\nbut he looked round him still in terrified wonder\r\n\r\nwhere is she  where is she  i cannot see her  stephen  stephen\r\nwhere are you  mrs stonehouse bewildered pointed where stephens\r\nsnowwhite face and brilliant hair seemed in the streaming sunlight like\r\nivory and gold\r\n\r\nthere  there  he caught her arm mechanically and putting his eyes to\r\nher wrist tried to look along her pointed finger  in an instant he\r\ndropped her arm moaning\r\n\r\ni cannot see her  what is it that is over me  this is worse than to be\r\nblind  he covered his face with his hands and sobbed\r\n\r\nhe felt light strong fingers on his forehead and hands fingers whose\r\ntouch he would have known had they been laid on him were he no longer\r\nquick  a voice whose music he had heard in his dreams for two long years\r\nsaid softly\r\n\r\ni am here harold  i am here  oh do not sob like that it breaks my\r\nheart to hear you  he took his hands from his face and held hers in\r\nthem staring intently at her as though his passionate gaze would win\r\nthrough every obstacle\r\n\r\nthat moment he never forgot  never could forget  he saw the room all\r\nrich in yellow  he saw pearl pale but gladeyed lying on a sofa\r\nholding the hand of her mother who stood beside her  he saw the great\r\nhigh window open the lines of the covered stone balcony without the\r\nstretch of green sward all vivid in the sunshine and beyond it the blue\r\nquivering sea  he saw all but that for which his very soul longed\r\nwithout to see which sight itself was valueless    but still he\r\nlooked and looked and stephen saw in his dark eyes though he could not\r\nsee her that which made her own eyes fill and the warm red glow on her\r\nface again    then she raised her eyes again and the gladness of her\r\nbeating heart seemed the answer to his own\r\n\r\nfor as he looked he saw as though emerging from a mist whose obscurity\r\nmelted with each instant what was to him the one face in all the world\r\nhe did not think then of its beautythat would come later and besides\r\nno beauty of one born of woman could outmatch the memorised beauty which\r\nhad so long held his heart  but that he had so schooled himself in long\r\nmonths of gloomy despair he would have taken her in his arms there and\r\nthen and heedless of the presence of others have poured out his full\r\nheart to her\r\n\r\nmrs stonehouse saw and understood  so too pearl who though a child was\r\na womanchild softly they rose up to steal away  but stephen saw them\r\nher own instincts too told her that her hour had not come  what she\r\nhoped for must come alone  so she called to her guests\r\n\r\ndont go  dont go mrs stonehouse  you know now that harold and i\r\nare old friends though neither of us knew ittill this moment  we were\r\nbrought up as    almost as brother and sister  pearl isnt it lovely\r\nto see your friend    to see the man again\r\n\r\nshe was so happy that she could only express herself with dignity\r\nthrough the happiness of others\r\n\r\npearl actually shrieked with joy as she rushed across the room and flung\r\nherself into harolds arms as he stooped to her  he raised her and she\r\nkissed him again and again and put her little hands all over his face\r\nand stroked very very gently his eyes and said\r\n\r\noh i am so glad  and so glad your poor eyes are unbind again  may i\r\ncall you harold too\r\n\r\nyou darling was all he could say as he kissed her and holding her in\r\none arm went across and shook hands with mrs stonehouse who wrung his\r\nhand hard\r\n\r\nthere was a little awkwardness in the group for none of them knew what\r\nwould be best to do next  in the midst of it there came a light knock at\r\nthe door and mr hilton entered saying\r\n\r\nthey told me you wished to see me at oncehulloa  he rushed across\r\nthe room and took harold by the shoulders turning his face to the light\r\nhe looked in his eyes long and earnestly the others holding their\r\nbreaths  presently he said without relaxing his gaze\r\n\r\ndid you see mistily at first\r\n\r\nyes\r\n\r\nseeing at the periphery but the centre being opaque\r\n\r\nyes  how did you know  why i couldnt seesee pointing to\r\nstephenlady de lannoy though her face was right in front of me\r\n\r\ndr hilton took his hands from his patients shoulders and shook him\r\nwarmly by both hands\r\n\r\ni am glad old fellow  it was worth waiting for wasnt it  but i say\r\nit was a dangerous thing to take off those bandages before i permitted\r\nhowever it has done no harm  but it was lucky that i mistrusted your\r\npatience and put the time for the experiment a week later than i thought\r\nnecessary    what is it  he turned from one to the other\r\nquestioningly there was a look on harolds face that he did not quite\r\ncomprehend\r\n\r\nhsh said the latter warningly ill tell you all about it   \r\nsome time\r\n\r\nthe awkward pause was broken by pearl who came to the doctor and said\r\n\r\ni must kiss you you know  it was you who saved the mans eyes  stephen\r\nhas told me how you watched him  the doctor was somewhat taken aback\r\nas yet he was ignorant of pearls existence  however he raised the\r\nchild in his arms and kissed her saying\r\n\r\nthank you my dear  i did all i could  but he helped much himself\r\nexcept at the very last  dont you ever go and take off bandages if you\r\nshould ever have the misfortune to have them on without the doctors\r\npermission  pearl nodded her head wisely and then wriggled out of his\r\narms and came again to harold looking up at him protectingly and saying\r\nin an oldfashioned way\r\n\r\nhow are you feeling now  none the worse i hope harold\r\n\r\nthe man lifted her up and kissed her again  when he set her down she\r\ncame over to lady de lannoy and held up her arms to be lifted\r\n\r\nand i must kiss you again too stephen  if lady de lannoy hadnt loved\r\nthe sweet little thing already she would have loved her for that\r\n\r\nthe door was opened and the butler announced\r\n\r\nluncheon is served your ladyship\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nafter a few days harold went over to varilands to stay for a while with\r\nthe stonehouses  mr stonehouse had arrived and both men were rejoiced\r\nto meet again  the elder never betrayed by word or sign that he\r\nrecognised the identity of the other person of the drama of whom he had\r\ntold him and who had come so accidentally into his life and the younger\r\nwas grateful to him for it  harold went almost every day to lannoy and\r\nsometimes the stonehouses went with him at other times stephen paid\r\nflying visits to varilands  she did not make any effort to detain\r\nharold she would not for worlds have made a sign which might influence\r\nhim  she was full now of that diffidence which every woman has who\r\nloves  she felt that she must wait must wait even if the waiting lasted\r\nto her grave  she felt as every woman does who really loves that she\r\nhad found her master\r\n\r\nand harold to whom something of the same diffidence was an old story\r\ngot the idea that her reticence was a part of the same feeling whose\r\nviolent expression had sent him out into the wilderness  and with the\r\nthought came the idea of his duty implied in her fathers dying trust\r\ngive her time    let her choose  for him the clock seemed to have\r\nstopped for two whole years and he was back at the time when the\r\nguardianship of his boy life was beginning to yield to the larger and\r\nmore selfish guardianship of manhood\r\n\r\nstephen noticing that he did not come near her as closely as she felt he\r\nmight and not realising his true reasonfor when did love ever realise\r\nthe true reason of the bashfulness of lovefelt a chillness which in\r\nturn reacted on her own manner\r\n\r\nand so these two ardent souls who yearned for each others love and the\r\nfull expression of it seemed as if they might end after all in drifting\r\napart  each thought that their secret was concealed  but both secrets\r\nwere already known to mrs stonehouse who knew nothing and to mr\r\nstonehouse who knew everything  even pearl had her own ideas as was\r\nonce shown in a confidence when they were alone in stephens bedroom\r\nafter helping her to finish her dressing just as stephen herself had at\r\na similar age helped her uncle gilbert  after some coy leading up to the\r\nsubject of pretty dresses the child putting her little mouth to the\r\nothers ear whispered\r\n\r\nmay i be your bridesmaid stephen  the woman was taken aback but she\r\nhad to speak at once for the childs eyes were on her\r\n\r\nof course you will darling  but ii may never be married\r\n\r\nyou  you must  i know someone who will make you  stephens heart\r\nbeat hard and rapidly  the childs talk though sweet and dear was more\r\nthan embarrassing  with however the desire to play with fire which is\r\na part of the nature of women she answered\r\n\r\nyou have some queer ideas little one in that pretty knowledgebox of\r\nyours\r\n\r\noh he never told me  but i know it all the same  and you know it too\r\nstephen  this was getting too close to be without danger so she tried\r\nto divert the thought from herself\r\n\r\nmy darling you may guess about other people though i dont say you\r\nought but you must not guess about me\r\n\r\nall right then she held up her arms to be lifted on the others knee\r\nand said\r\n\r\ni want to whisper to you  her voice and manner were so full of feeling\r\nthat somehow the other was moved  she bent her head and pearl taking\r\nher neck in her little palms said\r\n\r\ni thought oh long ago that i would marry him myself  but you knew\r\nhim first    and he only saved me    but you saved him    and\r\nthen she laid her head down on the throbbing bosom and sobbed   \r\n\r\nand stephen sobbed too\r\n\r\nbefore they left the room stephen said to her very gravely for the\r\nissue might be one of great concern\r\n\r\nof course pearl dear our secrets are all between ourselves  pearl\r\ncrossed her two forefingers and kissed them  but she said nothing she\r\nhad sworn  stephen went on\r\n\r\nand darling you will remember too that one must never speak or even\r\nthink if they can help it about anyones marrying anyone else till they\r\nsay so themselves  what is it dear that you are smiling at\r\n\r\ni know stephen  i musnt take off the bandage till the doctor says\r\nso\r\n\r\nstephen smiled and kissed her  hand in hand pearl chattering merrily\r\nthey went down to the drawingroom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter xxxviigolden silence\r\n\r\n\r\neach day that passed seemed to add to the trouble in the heart of these\r\nyoung people to widen the difficulty of expressing themselves  to\r\nstephen who had accepted the new condition of things and whose whole\r\nnature had bloomed again under the sunshine of hope it was the less\r\nintolerable  she had set herself to wait as had countless thousands of\r\nwomen before her and as due proportion will till the final cataclysm\r\nabolishes earthly unions  but harold felt the growth both positive and\r\nnegative as a new torture and he began to feel that he would be unable\r\nto go through with it  in his heart was the constant struggle of hope\r\nand in opposition to it the seeming realisation of every new fancy of\r\nevil  that bitter hour when the whole of creation was for him turned\r\nupside down was having its sad effect at last  had it not been for that\r\nhorrid remembrance he would have come to believe enough in himself to put\r\nhis future to the test  he would have made an opportunity at which\r\nstephen and himself would have with the fires of their mutual love burned\r\naway the encircling mist  there are times when a single minute of\r\ncommonsense would turn sorrow into joy and yet that minute our own\r\nnatures being the opposing forces will be allowed to pass\r\n\r\nthose who loved these young people were much concerned about them  mrs\r\nstonehouse took their trouble so much to heart that she spoke to her\r\nhusband about it seriously advising that one or other of them should\r\nmake an effort to bring things in the right way for their happiness  the\r\nwoman was sure of the womans feeling  it is from men not women that\r\nwomen hide their love  by sideglances and unthinking moments women note\r\nand learn  the man knew already from his own lips of the mans\r\npassion  but his lips were sealed by his loyalty and he said earnestly\r\n\r\nmy dear we must not interfere  not now at any rate we might cause\r\nthem great trouble  i am as sure as you are that they really love each\r\nother  but they must win happiness by themselves and through themselves\r\nalone  otherwise it would never be to them what it ought to be what it\r\nmight be what it will be\r\n\r\nso these friends were silent and the little tragedy developed  harolds\r\npatience began to give way under the constant strain of selfsuppression\r\nstephen tried to hide her love and fear under the mask of a gracious\r\ncalm  this the other took for indifference\r\n\r\nat last there came an hour which was full of new hopeless agony to\r\nstephen  she heard harold in a fragment of conversation speak to mr\r\nstonehouse of the need of returning to alaska  that sounded like a word\r\nof doom  in her inmost heart she knew that harold loved her and had she\r\nbeen free she would have herself spoken the words which would have drawn\r\nthe full truth to them both  but how could she do so having the\r\nremembrance of that other episode when without the reality of love she\r\nhad declared herself    oh the shame of it    the folly   \r\nand harold knew it all  how could he ever believe that it was real this\r\ntime   \r\n\r\nby the exercise of that selfrestraint which long suffering had taught\r\nher stephen so managed to control herself that none of her guests\r\nrealised what a blow she had received from a casual word  she bore\r\nherself gallantly till the last moment  after the old fashion of her\r\nyouth she had from the castle steps seen their departure  then she took\r\nher way to her own room and locked herself in  she did not often in\r\nthese days give way to tears when she did cry it was as a luxury and\r\nnot from poignant cause  her deep emotion was dryeyed as of old  now\r\nshe did not cry she sat still her hands clasped below her knees with\r\nset white face gazing out on the faroff sea  for hours she sat there\r\nlonely staring fixedly all the time though her thoughts were whirling\r\nwildly  at first she had some vague purpose which she hoped might\r\neventually work out into a plan  but thought would not come  everywhere\r\nthere was the same beginning a wild burning desire to let harold\r\nunderstand her feeling towards him to blot out with the conviction of\r\ntrust and love those bitter moments when in the madness of her\r\noverstrung passion she had heaped such insult upon him  everywhere the\r\nsame end an impasse  he seemingly could not would not understand  she\r\nknew now that the man had diffidences forbearances selfjudgments and\r\nselfdenials which made for the suppression in what he considered to be\r\nher interest of his own desires  this was tragedy indeed  again and\r\nagain came back the remembrance of that bitter regret of her aunt\r\nlaetitia which no happiness and no pain of her own had ever been able to\r\nefface\r\n\r\nto love and be helpless  to wait and wait and wait with heart all\r\naflame  to hope and hope till time seemed to have passed away and all\r\nthe world to stand still on your hopeless misery  to know that a word\r\nmight open up heaven and yet to have to remain mute  to keep back the\r\nglances that could enlighten to modulate the tones that might betray  to\r\nsee all you hoped for passing away    \r\n\r\nat last she seemed to understand the true force of pride which has in it\r\na thousand forces of its own positive negative restrainful  oh how\r\nblind she had been  how little she had learned from the miseries that\r\nthe other woman whom she loved had suffered  how unsympathetic she had\r\nbeen how selfengrossed how callous to the sensibilities of others  and\r\nnow to her in her turn had come the same suffering the same galling of\r\nthe iron fetters of pride and of convention which is its original\r\nexpression  must it be that the very salt of youth must lose its savour\r\nbefore the joys of youth could be won  what after all was youth if out\r\nof its own inherent power it must work its own destruction  if youth was\r\nso why not then trust the wisdom of age  if youth could not act for its\r\nown redemption   \r\n\r\nhere the rudiment of a thought struck her and changed the current of her\r\nreason  a thought so winged with hope that she dared not even try to\r\ncomplete it    she thought and thought till the long autumn shadows\r\nfell around her  but the misty purpose had become real\r\n\r\nafter dinner she went up alone to the mill  it was late for a visit for\r\nthe silver lady kept early hours  but she found her friend as usual in\r\nher room whose windows swept the course of the sun  seeing that her\r\nvisitor was in a state of mental disturbance such as she had once before\r\nexhibited she blew out the candles and took the same seat in the eastern\r\nwindow she had occupied on the night which they both so well remembered\r\n\r\nstephen understood both acts and was grateful afresh  the darkness\r\nwould be a help to her in what she had to say and the resumption of the\r\nold seat and attitude did away with the awkwardness of new confidence\r\nduring the weeks that had passed stephen had kept her friend informed of\r\nthe rescue and progress of the injured man  since the discovery of\r\nharolds identity she had allowed her to infer her feeling towards him\r\n\r\nshyly she had conveyed her hopes that all the bitter part of the past\r\nmight be wiped out  to the woman who already knew of the love that had\r\nalways been but had only awakened to consciousness in the absence of its\r\nobject a hint was sufficient to build upon  she had noticed the gloom\r\nthat had of late been creeping over the girls happiness and she had\r\nbeen much troubled about it  but she had thought it wiser to be silent\r\nshe well knew that should unhappily the time for comfort come it must be\r\nprecluded by new and more explicit confidence  so she too had been\r\nanxiously waiting the progress of events  now as she put her arms round\r\nthe girl she said softly not in the whisper which implies doubt of some\r\nkind but in the soft voices which conveys sympathy and trust\r\n\r\ntell me dear child\r\n\r\nand then in broken words shyly spoken and spoken in such a way that the\r\nsilences were more eloquent than the words the girl conveyed what was in\r\nher heart  the other listened now and again stroking the beautiful\r\nhair  when all was said there was a brief pause  the silver lady spoke\r\nno word but the pressure of her delicate hand conveyed sympathy\r\n\r\nin but a halfconscious way in words that came so shrinkingly through\r\nthe darkness that they hardly reached the ear bent low to catch them\r\ncame stephens murmured thought\r\n\r\noh if he only knew  and i cant tell him i cant dare not  i must\r\nnot  how could i dishonour him by bearing myself towards him as to that\r\nother    worthless      oh the happy happy girls who have\r\nmothers      all the muscles of her body seemed to shrink and\r\ncollapse till she was like an inert mass at the silver ladys feet\r\n\r\nbut the other understood\r\n\r\n after a long long pause when stephens sobbing had died away when\r\neach muscle of her body had become rigid on its return to normal calm\r\nthe silver lady began to talk of other matters and conversation became\r\nnormal  stephens courage seemed somehow to be restored and she talked\r\nbrightly\r\n\r\nbefore they parted the silver lady made a request  she said in her\r\nnatural voice\r\n\r\ncouldst thou bring that gallant man who saved so many lives and to whom\r\nthe lord was so good in the restoration of his sight to see me  thou\r\nknowest i have made a resolution not to go forth from this calm place\r\nwhilst i may remain  but i should like to see him before he returns to\r\nthat far north where he has done such wonders  he is evidently a man of\r\nkind heart perhaps he will not mind coming to see a lonely woman who is\r\nno longer young  there is much i should like to ask him of that land of\r\nwhich nothing was known in my own youth  perhaps he will not mind seeing\r\nme alone  stephens heart beat furiously  she felt suffocating with\r\nnew hope for what could be but good from harolds meeting with that\r\nsweet woman who had already brought so much comfort into her own life\r\nshe was abashed and yet radiant she seemed to tread on air as she stood\r\nbeside her friend saying farewell  she did not wish to speak  so the\r\ntwo women kissed and parted\r\n\r\nit had been arranged that two days hence the stonehouse party were to\r\nspend the day at lannoy coming before lunch and staying the night as\r\nthey wanted in the afternoon to return a visit at some distance to the\r\nnorth of lannoy  harold was to ride over with them\r\n\r\nwhen the varilands party arrived stephen told them of sister ruths wish\r\nto see harold  pearl at once proffered a request that she also should be\r\ntaken at some other time to see the silver lady  harold acquiesced\r\nheartily and it was agreed that some time in the late afternoon he\r\nshould pay the visit  stephen would bring him\r\n\r\nstrangely enough she felt no awkwardness no trepidation as they rode\r\nup the steep road to the mill\r\n\r\nwhen the introduction had been effected and half an hour had been\r\nconsumed in conventional small talk stephen obedience to a look from\r\nthe silver lady rose  she said in they most natural way she could\r\n\r\nnow sister ruth i will leave you two alone if you do not mind  harold\r\ncan tell you all you want to know about alaska and perhaps if you are\r\nvery good he will tell some of his adventures  good afternoon dear  i\r\nwish you were to be with us tonight but i know your rule  i go for my\r\nride  sultan has had no exercise for five days and he looked at me\r\nquite reproachfully when we met this morning  au revoir harold  we\r\nshall meet at dinner\r\n\r\nwhen she had gone harold came back from the door and stood in the window\r\nlooking east  the silver lady came and stood beside him  she did not\r\nseem to notice his face but in the mysterious way of women she watched\r\nhim keenly  she wished to satisfy her own mind before she undertook her\r\nselfappointed task\r\n\r\n her eyes were turned towards the headland towards which stephen on her\r\nwhite arab was galloping at breakneck speed  he was too good a horseman\r\nhimself and he knew her prowess on horseback too well to have any\r\nanxiety regarding such a rider at stephen  it was not fear then that\r\nmade his face so white and his eyes to have such an illimitable sadness\r\n\r\nthe silver lady made up her mind  all her instincts were to trust him\r\nshe recognised a noble nature with which truth would be her surest\r\nforce\r\n\r\ncome she said sit here friend where another friend has often sat\r\nwith me  from this you can see all the coastline and all that thou\r\nwilt  harold put a chair beside the one she pointed out and when she\r\nwas seated he sat also  she began at once with a desperate courage\r\n\r\ni have wanted much to see thee  i have heard much of thee before thy\r\ncoming  there was something in the tone of her voice which arrested his\r\nattention and he looked keenly at her  here in the full light her\r\nface looked sadly white and he noticed that her lips trembled  he said\r\nwith all the kindliness of his nature for from the first moment he had\r\nseen her he had taken to her her purity and earnestness and sweetness\r\nappealing to some aspiration within him\r\n\r\nyou are pale  i fear you are not well  may i call your maid  can i do\r\nanything for you  she waved her hand gently\r\n\r\nnay  it is nothing  it is but the result of a sleepless night and much\r\nthought\r\n\r\noh  i wish i had known  i could have put off my visit and i could\r\nhave come any other time to suit you  she smiled gently\r\n\r\ni fear that would have availed but little  it was of thy coming that i\r\nwas concerned  seeing his look of amazement she went on quickly her\r\nvoice becoming more steady as she lost sight of herself in her task\r\n\r\nbe patient a little with me  i am an old woman and until recently it\r\nhas been many and many years since the calm which i sought here has been\r\nruffled  i had come to believe that for me earthly troubles were no\r\nmore  but there has come into my life a new concern  i have heard so\r\nmuch of thee and before thy coming  the recurrence of the phrase\r\nstruck him  he would have asked how such could be but he deemed it\r\nbetter to wait  she went on\r\n\r\ni have been wishful to ask thy advice  but why should not i tell thee\r\noutright that which troubles me  i am not used at least for these many\r\nyears to dissemble  i can but trust thee in all and lean on thy mans\r\nmercy to understand and to aid me\r\n\r\ni shall do all in my power believe me said harold simply  speak\r\nfreely  she pointed out of the window where stephens white horse\r\nseemed on the mighty sweep of green sward like a little dot\r\n\r\nit is of her that i would speak to thee  harolds heart began to beat\r\nhard he felt that something was coming  the silver lady went on\r\n\r\nwhy thinkest thou that she rideth at such speed  it is her habit  he\r\nwaited  she continued\r\n\r\ndoth it not seem to thee that such reckless movement is the result of\r\nmuch trouble that she seeketh forgetfulness  he knew that she was\r\nspeaking truly and somehow the conviction was borne upon him that she\r\nknew his secret heart and was appealing to it  if it was about stephen\r\nif her disquiet was about her then god bless her  he would be patient\r\nand grateful  the quakers voice seemed to come through his thought as\r\nthough she had continued speaking whilst he had paused\r\n\r\nwe have all our own secrets  i have had mine and i doubt not that thou\r\nhast had may still have thine own  stephen hath hers  may i speak to\r\nthee of her\r\n\r\ni shall be proud  oh madam i thank you with all my heart for your\r\nsweet kindness to her  i cannot say what i feel for she has always been\r\nvery dear to me  in the pause before she spoke again the beating of his\r\nown heart seemed to reecho the quick sounds of stephens galloping\r\nhorse  he was surprised at the method of her speech when it did come\r\nfor she forgot her quaker idiom and spoke in the phrasing of her youth\r\n\r\ndo you love her still\r\n\r\nwith all my soul  more than ever\r\n\r\nthen god be thanked for it is in your power to do much good  to\r\nrescue a poor human grieving soul from despair  her words conveyed\r\njoy greater than she knew  harold did not himself know why the air\r\nseemed filled with sounds that seemed to answer every doubt of his life\r\nhe felt understood with that understanding which is quicker than\r\nthought  the silver lady went on now with a rush\r\n\r\nsee i have trusted you indeed  i have given away another womans\r\nsecret but i do it without fear  i can see that you also are troubled\r\nand when i look back on my own life and remember the trouble that sent me\r\nout of the world a lonely recluse here in this spot far from the stress\r\nof life i rejoice that any act of mine can save such another tragedy as\r\nmy own  i see that i need not go into detail  you know that i am\r\nspeaking truth  it was before you came so heroically on this new scene\r\nthat she told me her secret  at a time when nothing was known of you\r\nexcept that you had disappeared  when she laid bare her poor bleeding\r\nheart to me she did it in such wise that for an instant i feared that it\r\nwas a murder which she had committed  indeed she called it so  you\r\nunderstand that i know all your secret all her part in it at least  and\r\ni know that you understand what loving duty lies before you  i see it in\r\nyour eyes your brave true eyes  go and the lord be with thee  her\r\naccustomed idiom had returned with prayer  she turned her head away\r\nand standing up leaned against the window  bending over he took her\r\nhand and said simply\r\n\r\ngod bless you  i shall come back to thank you either tonight or to\r\nmorrow and i hope that she will be with me\r\n\r\nhe went quickly out of the room  the woman stood for long looking out of\r\nthe window and following with teardimmed eyes the movement of his great\r\nblack horse as he swept across country straight as the crow flies\r\ntowards the headland whither stephen had gone\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nstephen passed over the wide expanse without thought certainly without\r\nmemory of it  never in her afterlife could she recall any thought that\r\nhad passed through her mind from the time she left the open gate of the\r\nwindmill yard till she pulled up her smoking panting horse beside the\r\nruin of the fishers house\r\n\r\nstephen was not unhappy  she was not happy in any conscious form  she\r\nwas satisfied rather than dissatisfied  she was a woman  a woman who\r\nwaited the coming of a man\r\n\r\nfor a while she stood at the edge of the cliff and looked at the turmoil\r\nof the tide churning on the rocks below  her heart went out in a great\r\nburst of thankfulness that it was her hand which had been privileged to\r\naid in rescuing so dear a life  then she looked around her  ostensibly\r\nit was to survey the ruined house but in reality to search even then\r\nunder her lashes the whole green expanse sloping up to the windmill for\r\nsome moving figure  she saw that which made her throat swell and her\r\nears to hear celestial music  but she would not allow herself to think\r\nof that at all events  she was all woman now allpatient and\r\nallsubmissive  she waited the man and the man was coming\r\n\r\nfor a few minutes she walked round the house as though looking at it\r\ncritically for some afterpurpose  after the wreck stephen had suggested\r\nto trinity house that there should be a lighthouse on the point and\r\noffered to bear the expense of building it  she was awaiting the answer\r\nof the brethren and of course nothing would be done in clearing the\r\nground for any purpose till the answer had come  she felt now that if\r\nthat reply was negative she would herself build there a pleasurehouse\r\nof her own\r\n\r\nthen she went to the edge of the cliff and went down the zigzag by which\r\nthe man and horse had gone to their gallant task  at the edge of the\r\nflat rock she sat and thought\r\n\r\nand through all her thoughts passed the rider who even now was thundering\r\nover the green sward on his way to her  in her fancy at first and later\r\nin her ears she could hear the sound of his sweeping gallop\r\n\r\n it was thus that a man should come to a woman\r\n\r\nshe had no doubts now  her quietude was a hymn of grateful praise\r\n\r\nthe sound stopped  with all her ears she listened her heart now\r\nbeginning to beat furiously  the sea before her all lines and furrows\r\nwith the passing tide was dark under the shadow of the cliff and the\r\nedge of the shadow was marked with the golden hue of sunset\r\n\r\nand then she saw suddenly a pillar of shadow beyond the line of the\r\ncliff  it rested but a moment moved swiftly along the edge and then\r\nwas lost to her eyes\r\n\r\nbut to another sense there was greater comfort she heard the clatter of\r\nrolling pebbles and the scramble of eager feet  harold was hastening\r\ndown the zigzag\r\n\r\noh the music of that sound  it woke all the finer instincts of the\r\nwoman  all the dross and thought of self passed away  nature sweet and\r\nsimple and true reigned alone  instinctively she rose and came towards\r\nhim  in the simple nobility of her selfsurrender and her purpose which\r\nwere at one with the grandeur of nature around her to be negative was to\r\nbe false\r\n\r\nsince he had spoken with the silver lady harold had swept through the\r\nair the rush of his foaming horse over the sward had been but a slow\r\nphysical progress which mocked the onsweep of his mind  in is rapid\r\nride he too had been finding himself  by the reading of his own soul he\r\nknew now that love needs a voice that a mans love to be welcomed to\r\nthe full should be dominant and selfbelieving\r\n\r\nwhen
