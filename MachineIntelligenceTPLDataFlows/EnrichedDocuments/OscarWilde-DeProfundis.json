V. Lucas, no selections of\r\npoetry or prose have ever given complete satisfaction to anyone except\r\nthe compiler.  But critics derive great satisfaction from pointing out\r\nerrors of omission and inclusion on the part of the anthologist, and all\r\nof us have putatively re-arranged and re-edited even the \"Golden\r\nTreasury\" in our leisure moments.  In an age when \"Art for Art's sake\" is\r\nan exploded doctrine, anthologies, like everything else, must have a\r\npurpose.  The purpose or object of the present volume is to afford\r\nadmirers of Wilde's work the same innocent pleasure obtainable from\r\nsimilar compilations, namely that of reconstructing a selection of their\r\nown in their mind's eye--for copyright considerations would interfere\r\nwith the materialisation of their dream.\r\n\r\nA stray observation in an esteemed weekly periodical determined the plan\r\nof this anthology and the choice of particular passages.  The writer,\r\nwhose name has escaped me, opined that the reason the works of Pater and\r\nWilde were no longer read was owing to both authors having treated\r\nEnglish as a dead language.  By a singular coincidence I had purchased\r\nsimultaneously with the newspaper a shilling copy of Pater's\r\n\"Renaissance,\" published by Messrs. Macmillan; and a few days afterwards\r\nMessrs. Methuen issued at a shilling the twenty-eighth edition of \"De\r\nProfundis.\"  Obviously either Messrs. Macmillan and Messrs. Methuen or\r\nthe authority on dead languages must have been suffering from\r\nhallucinations.  It occurred to me that a selection of Wilde's prose\r\nmight at least rehabilitate the notorious reputation for common sense\r\nenjoyed by all publishers, who rarely issue shilling editions of deceased\r\nauthors for mere aesthetic considerations.  And I confess to a hope that\r\nthis volume may reach the eye or ear of those who have not read Wilde's\r\nbooks, or of those, such as Mr. Sydney Grundy, who are irritated by the\r\nrevival of his plays and the praise accorded to his works throughout the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nWilde's prose is distinguished by its extraordinary ease and clarity, and\r\nby the absence--very singular in his case--of the preciosity which he\r\nadmired too much in other writers, and advocated with over-emphasis.\r\nPerhaps that is why many of his stories and essays and plays are used as\r\nEnglish text-books in Russian and Scandinavian and Hungarian schools.\r\nArtifice and affectation, often assumed to be recurrent defects in his\r\nwritings by those unacquainted with them, are comparatively rare.  Wilde\r\nonce boasted in an interview that only Flaubert, Pater, Keats, and\r\nMaeterlinck had influenced him, and then added in a characteristic way:\r\n\"But I had already gone more than half-way to meet them.\"  Anyone curious\r\nas to the origin of Wilde's style and development should consult the\r\nlearned treatise {1} of Dr. Ernst Bendz, whose comprehensive treatment of\r\nthe subject renders any elucidation of mine superfluous; while nothing\r\ncan be added to Mr. Holbrook Jackson's masterly criticism {2} of Wilde\r\nand his position in literature.\r\n\r\nIn making this selection, with the valuable assistance of Mr. Stuart\r\nMason, I have endeavoured to illustrate and to justify the critical\r\nappreciations of both Dr. Bendz and Mr. Holbrook Jackson, as well as to\r\nafford the general reader a fair idea of Wilde's variety as a prose\r\nwriter.  He is more various than almost any author of the last century,\r\nthough the act of writing was always a burden to him.  Some critic\r\nacutely pointed out that poetry and prose were almost side-issues for\r\nhim.  The resulting faults and weakness of what he left are obvious.\r\nExcept in the plays he has no sustained scheme of thought.  Even \"De\r\nProfundis\" is too desultory.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of convenient reference I have exercised the prerogative\r\nof a literary executor and editor by endowing with special titles some of\r\nthe pieces quoted in these pages.  Though unlike one of Wilde's other\r\nfriends I cannot claim to have collaborated with him or to have assisted\r\nhim in any of his plays, I was sometimes permitted, as Wilde acknowledges\r\nin different letters, to act in the capacity of godfather by suggesting\r\nthe actual titles by which some of his books are known to the world.  I\r\nmention the circumstance only as a precedent for my present temerity.  To\r\ncompensate those who disapprove of my choice, I have included two\r\nunpublished letters.  The examples of Wilde's epistolary style, published\r\nsince his death, have been generally associated with disagreeable\r\nsubjects.  Those included here will, I hope, prove a pleasant contrast.\r\n\r\nROBERT ROSS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THEY STRUCK A CONTEMPORARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is such a thing as robbing a story of its reality by trying to make\r\nit too true, and _The Black Arrow_ is so inartistic as not to contain a\r\nsingle anachronism to boast of, while the transformation of Dr. Jekyll\r\nreads dangerously like an experiment out of the _Lancet_.  As for Mr.\r\nRider Haggard, who really has, or had once, the makings of a perfectly\r\nmagnificent liar, he is now so afraid of being suspected of genius that\r\nwhen he does tell us anything marvellous, he feels bound to invent a\r\npersonal reminiscence, and to put it into a footnote as a kind of\r\ncowardly corroboration.  Nor are our other novelists much better.  Mr.\r\nHenry James writes fiction as if it were a painful duty, and wastes upon\r\nmean motives and imperceptible 'points of view' his neat literary style,\r\nhis felicitous phrases, his swift and caustic satire.  Mr. Hall Caine, it\r\nis true, aims at the grandiose, but then he writes at the top of his\r\nvoice.  He is so loud that one cannot bear what he says.  Mr. James Payn\r\nis an adept in the art of concealing what is not worth finding.  He hunts\r\ndown the obvious with the enthusiasm of a short-sighted detective.  As\r\none turns over the pages, the suspense of the author becomes almost\r\nunbearable.  The horses of Mr. William Black's phaeton do not soar\r\ntowards the sun.  They merely frighten the sky at evening into violent\r\nchromolithographic effects.  On seeing them approach, the peasants take\r\nrefuge in dialect.  Mrs. Oliphant prattles pleasantly about curates, lawn-\r\ntennis parties, domesticity, and other wearisome things.  Mr. Marion\r\nCrawford has immolated himself upon the altar of local colour.  He is\r\nlike the lady in the French comedy who keeps talking about \"le beau ciel\r\nd'Italie.\"  Besides, he has fallen into the bad habit of uttering moral\r\nplatitudes.  He is always telling us that to be good is to be good, and\r\nthat to be bad is to be wicked.  At times he is almost edifying.  _Robert\r\nElsmere_ is of course a masterpiece--a masterpiece of the \"genre\r\nennuyeux,\" the one form of literature that the English people seems\r\nthoroughly to enjoy.  A thoughtful young friend of ours once told us that\r\nit reminded him of the sort of conversation that goes on at a meat tea in\r\nthe house of a serious Nonconformist family, and we can quite believe it.\r\nIndeed it is only in England that such a book could be produced.  England\r\nis the home of lost ideas.  As for that great and daily increasing school\r\nof novelists for whom the sun always rises in the East-End, the only\r\nthing that can be said about them is that they find life crude, and leave\r\nit raw.--_The Decay of Lying_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUALITY OF GEORGE MEREDITH\r\n\r\n\r\nAh!  Meredith!  Who can define him?  His style is chaos illumined by\r\nflashes of lightning.  As a writer he has mastered everything except\r\nlanguage: as a novelist he can do everything, except tell a story: as an\r\nartist he is everything except articulate.  Somebody in\r\nShakespeare--Touchstone, I think--talks about a man who is always\r\nbreaking his shins over his own wit, and it seems to me that this might\r\nserve as the basis for a criticism of Meredith's method.  But whatever he\r\nis, he is not a realist.  Or rather I would say that he is a child of\r\nrealism who is not on speaking terms with his father.  By deliberate\r\nchoice he has made himself a romanticist.  He has refused to bow the knee\r\nto Baal, and after all, even if the man's fine spirit did not revolt\r\nagainst the noisy assertions of realism, his style would be quite\r\nsufficient of itself to keep life at a respectful distance.  By its means\r\nhe has planted round his garden a hedge full of thorns, and red with\r\nwonderful roses.  As for Balzac, he was a most remarkable combination of\r\nthe artistic temperament with the scientific spirit.  The latter he\r\nbequeathed to his disciples.  The former was entirely his own.  The\r\ndifference between such a book as M. Zola's _L'Assommoir_ and Balzac's\r\n_Illusions Perdues_ is the difference between unimaginative realism and\r\nimaginative reality.  'All Balzac's characters;' said Baudelaire, 'are\r\ngifted with the same ardour of life that animated himself.  All his\r\nfictions are as deeply coloured as dreams.  Each mind is a weapon loaded\r\nto the muzzle with will.  The very scullions have genius.'  A steady\r\ncourse of Balzac reduces our living friends to shadows, and our\r\nacquaintances to the shadows of shades.  His characters have a kind of\r\nfervent fiery-coloured existence.  They dominate us, and defy scepticism.\r\nOne of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of Lucien de\r\nRubempre.  It is a grief from which I have never been able completely to\r\nrid myself.  It haunts me in my moments of pleasure.  I remember it when\r\nI laugh.  But Balzac is no more a realist than Holbein was.  He created\r\nlife, he did not copy it.  I admit, however, that he set far too high a\r\nvalue on modernity of form, and that, consequently, there is no book of\r\nhis that, as an artistic masterpiece, can rank with _Salammbo_ or\r\n_Esmond_, or _The Cloister and the Hearth_, or the _Vicomte de\r\nBragelonne_.--_The Decay of Lying_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE THE FALLACIOUS MODEL\r\n\r\n\r\nArt begins with abstract decoration, with purely imaginative and\r\npleasurable work dealing with what is unreal and non-existent.  This is\r\nthe first stage.  Then Life becomes fascinated with this new wonder, and\r\nasks to be admitted into the charmed circle.  Art takes life as part of\r\nher rough material, recreates it, and refashions it in fresh forms, is\r\nabsolutely indifferent to fact, invents, imagines, dreams, and keeps\r\nbetween herself and reality the impenetrable barrier of beautiful style,\r\nof decorative or ideal treatment.  The third stage is when Life gets the\r\nupper hand, and drives Art out into the wilderness.  That is the true\r\ndecadence, and it is from this that we are now suffering.\r\n\r\nTake the case of the English drama.  At first in the hands of the monks\r\nDramatic Art was abstract, decorative and mythological.  Then she\r\nenlisted Life in her service, and using some of life's external forms,\r\nshe created an entirely new race of beings, whose sorrows were more\r\nterrible than any sorrow man has ever felt, whose joys were keener than\r\nlover's joys, who had the rage of the Titans and the calm of the gods,\r\nwho had monstrous and marvellous sins, monstrous and marvellous virtues.\r\nTo them she gave a language different from that of actual use, a language\r\nfull of resonant music and sweet rhythm, made stately by solemn cadence,\r\nor made delicate by fanciful rhyme, jewelled with wonderful words, and\r\nenriched with lofty diction.  She clothed her children in strange raiment\r\nand gave them masks, and at her bidding the antique world rose from its\r\nmarble tomb.  A new Caesar stalked through the streets of risen Rome, and\r\nwith purple sail and flute-led oars another Cleopatra passed up the river\r\nto Antioch.  Old myth and legend and dream took shape and substance.\r\nHistory was entirely re-written, and there was hardly one of the\r\ndramatists who did not recognise that the object of Art is not simple\r\ntruth but complex beauty.  In this they were perfectly right.  Art itself\r\nis really a form of exaggeration; and selection, which is the very spirit\r\nof art, is nothing more than an intensified mode of over-emphasis.\r\n\r\nBut Life soon shattered the perfection of the form.  Even in Shakespeare\r\nwe can see the beginning of the end.  It shows itself by the gradual\r\nbreaking-up of the blank-verse in the later plays, by the predominance\r\ngiven to prose, and by the over-importance assigned to characterisation.\r\nThe passages in Shakespeare--and they are many--where the language is\r\nuncouth, vulgar, exaggerated, fantastic, obscene even, are entirely due\r\nto Life calling for an echo of her own voice, and rejecting the\r\nintervention of beautiful style, through which alone should life be\r\nsuffered to find expression.  Shakespeare is not by any means a flawless\r\nartist.  He is too fond of going directly to life, and borrowing life's\r\nnatural utterance.  He forgets that when Art surrenders her imaginative\r\nmedium she surrenders everything.--_The Decay of Lying_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE THE DISCIPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have all seen in our own day in England how a certain curious and\r\nfascinating type of beauty, invented and emphasised by two imaginative\r\npainters, has so influenced Life that whenever one goes to a private view\r\nor to an artistic salon one sees, here the mystic eyes of Rossetti's\r\ndream, the long ivory throat, the strange square-cut jaw, the loosened\r\nshadowy hair that he so ardently loved, there the sweet maidenhood of\r\n'The Golden Stair,' the blossom-like mouth and weary loveliness of the\r\n'Laus Amoris,' the passion-pale face of Andromeda, the thin hands and\r\nlithe beauty of the Vivian in 'Merlin's Dream.'  And it has always been\r\nso.  A great artist invents a type, and Life tries to copy it, to\r\nreproduce it in a popular form, like an enterprising publisher.  Neither\r\nHolbein nor Vandyck found in England what they have given us.  They\r\nbrought their types with them, and Life with her keen imitative faculty\r\nset herself to supply the master with models.  The Greeks, with their\r\nquick artistic instinct, understood this, and set in the bride's chamber\r\nthe statue of Hermes or of Apollo, that she might bear children as lovely\r\nas the works of art that she looked at in her rapture or her pain.  They\r\nknew that Life gains from art not merely spirituality, depth of thought\r\nand feeling, soul-turmoil or soul-peace, but that she can form herself on\r\nthe very lines and colours of art, and can reproduce the dignity of\r\nPheidias as well as the grace of Praxiteles.  Hence came their objection\r\nto realism.  They disliked it on purely social grounds.  They felt that\r\nit inevitably makes people ugly, and they were perfectly right.  We try\r\nto improve the conditions of the race by means of good air, free\r\nsunlight, wholesome water, and hideous bare buildings for the better\r\nhousing of the lower orders.  But these things merely produce health,\r\nthey do not produce beauty.  For this, Art is required, and the true\r\ndisciples of the great artist are not his studio-imitators, but those who\r\nbecome like his works of art, be they plastic as in Greek days, or\r\npictorial as in modern times; in a word, Life is Art's best, Art's only\r\npupil.--_The Decay of Lying_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE THE PLAGIARIST\r\n\r\n\r\nI once asked a lady, who knew Thackeray intimately, whether he had had\r\nany model for Becky Sharp.  She told me that Becky was an invention, but\r\nthat the idea of the character had been partly suggested by a governess\r\nwho lived in the neighbourhood of Kensington Square, and was the\r\ncompanion of a very selfish and rich old woman.  I inquired what became\r\nof the governess, and she replied that, oddly enough, some years after\r\nthe appearance of _Vanity Fair_, she ran away with the nephew of the lady\r\nwith whom she was living, and for a short time made a great splash in\r\nsociety, quite in Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's style, and entirely by Mrs.\r\nRawdon Crawley's methods.  Ultimately she came to grief, disappeared to\r\nthe Continent, and used to be occasionally seen at Monte Carlo and other\r\ngambling places.  The noble gentleman from whom the same great\r\nsentimentalist drew Colonel Newcome died, a few months after _The\r\nNewcomer_ had reached a fourth edition, with the word 'Adsum' on his\r\nlips.  Shortly after Mr. Stevenson published his curious psychological\r\nstory of transformation, a friend of mine, called Mr. Hyde, was in the\r\nnorth of London, and being anxious to get to a railway station, took what\r\nhe thought would be a short cut, lost his way, and found himself in a\r\nnetwork of mean, evil-looking streets.  Feeling rather nervous he began\r\nto walk extremely fast, when suddenly out of an archway ran a child right\r\nbetween his legs.  It fell on the pavement, he tripped over it, and\r\ntrampled upon it.  Being of course very much frightened and a little\r\nhurt, it began to scream, and in a few seconds the whole street was full\r\nof rough people who came pouring out of the houses like ants.  They\r\nsurrounded him, and asked him his name.  He was just about to give it\r\nwhen he suddenly remembered the opening incident in Mr. Stevenson's\r\nstory.  He was so filled with horror at having realised in his own person\r\nthat terrible and well-written scene, and at having done accidentally,\r\nthough in fact, what the Mr. Hyde of fiction had done with deliberate\r\nintent, that he ran away as hard as he could go.  He was, however, very\r\nclosely followed, and finally he took refuge in a surgery, the door of\r\nwhich happened to be open, where he explained to a young assistant, who\r\nhappened to be there, exactly what had occurred.  The humanitarian crowd\r\nwere induced to go away on his giving them a small sum of money, and as\r\nsoon as the coast was clear he left.  As he passed out, the name on the\r\nbrass door-plate of the surgery caught his eye.  It was 'Jekyll.'  At\r\nleast it should have been.--_The Decay of Lying_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDISPENSABLE EAST\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is true about the drama and the novel is no less true about those\r\narts that we call the decorative arts.  The whole history of these arts\r\nin Europe is the record of the struggle between Orientalism, with its\r\nfrank rejection of imitation, its love of artistic convention, its\r\ndislike to the actual representation of any object in Nature, and our own\r\nimitative spirit.  Wherever the former has been paramount, as in\r\nByzantium, Sicily and Spain, by actual contact, or in the rest of Europe\r\nby the influence of the Crusades, we have had beautiful and imaginative\r\nwork in which the visible things of life are transmuted into artistic\r\nconventions, and the things that Life has not are invented and fashioned\r\nfor her delight.  But wherever we have returned to Life and Nature, our\r\nwork has always become vulgar, common and uninteresting.  Modern\r\ntapestry, with its aerial effects, its elaborate perspective, its broad\r\nexpanses of waste sky, its faithful and laborious realism, has no beauty\r\nwhatsoever.  The pictorial glass of Germany is absolutely detestable.  We\r\nare beginning to weave possible carpets in England, but only because we\r\nhave returned to the method and spirit of the East.  Our rugs and carpets\r\nof twenty years ago, with their solemn depressing truths, their inane\r\nworship of Nature, their sordid reproductions of visible objects, have\r\nbecome, even to the Philistine, a source of laughter.  A cultured\r\nMahomedan once remarked to us, \"You Christians are so occupied in\r\nmisinterpreting the fourth commandment that you have never thought of\r\nmaking an artistic application of the second.\"  He was perfectly right,\r\nand the whole truth of the matter is this: The proper school to learn art\r\nin is not Life but Art.--_The Decay of Lying_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF THE IMPRESSIONISTS ON CLIMATE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere, if not from the Impressionists, do we get those wonderful brown\r\nfogs that come creeping down our streets, blurring the gas-lamps and\r\nchanging the houses into monstrous shadows?  To whom, if not to them and\r\ntheir master, do we owe the lovely silver mists that brood over our\r\nriver, and turn to faint forms of fading grace curved bridge and swaying\r\nbarge?  The extraordinary change that has taken place in the climate of\r\nLondon during the last ten years is entirely due to a particular school\r\nof Art.  You smile.  Consider the matter from a scientific or a\r\nmetaphysical point of view, and you will find that I am right.  For what\r\nis Nature?  Nature is no great mother who has borne us.  She is our\r\ncreation.  It is in our brain that she quickens to life.  Things are\r\nbecause we see them, and what we see, and how we see it, depends on the\r\nArts that have influenced us.  To look at a thing is very different from\r\nseeing a thing.  One does not see anything until one sees its beauty.\r\nThen, and then only, does it come into existence.  At present, people see\r\nfogs, not because there are fogs, but because poets and painters have\r\ntaught them the mysterious loveliness of such effects.  There may have\r\nbeen fogs for centuries in London.  I dare say there were.  But no one\r\nsaw them, and so we do not know anything about them.  They did not exist\r\ntill Art had invented them.  Now, it must be admitted, fogs are carried\r\nto excess.  They have become the mere mannerism of a clique, and the\r\nexaggerated realism of their method gives dull people bronchitis.  Where\r\nthe cultured catch an effect, the uncultured catch cold.  And so, let us\r\nbe humane, and invite Art to turn her wonderful eyes elsewhere.  She has\r\ndone so already, indeed.  That white quivering sunlight that one sees now\r\nin France, with its strange blotches of mauve, and its restless violet\r\nshadows, is her latest fancy, and, on the whole, Nature reproduces it\r\nquite admirably.  Where she used to give us Corots and Daubignys, she\r\ngives us now exquisite Monets and entrancing Pissaros.  Indeed there are\r\nmoments, rare, it is true, but still to be observed from time to time,\r\nwhen Nature becomes absolutely modern.  Of course she is not always to be\r\nrelied upon.  The fact is that she is in this unfortunate position.  Art\r\ncreates an incomparable and unique effect, and, having done so, passes on\r\nto other things.  Nature, upon the other hand, forgetting that imitation\r\ncan be made the sincerest form of insult, keeps on repeating this effect\r\nuntil we all become absolutely wearied of it.  Nobody of any real\r\nculture, for instance, ever talks nowadays about the beauty of a sunset.\r\nSunsets are quite old-fashioned.  They belong to the time when Turner was\r\nthe last note in art.  To admire them is a distinct sign of provincialism\r\nof temperament.  Upon the other hand they go on.--_The Decay of Lying_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXPOSURE OF NATURALISM\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter all, what the imitative arts really give us are merely the various\r\nstyles of particular artists, or of certain schools of artists.  Surely\r\nyou don't imagine that the people of the Middle Ages bore any resemblance\r\nat all to the figures on mediaeval stained glass, or in mediaeval stone\r\nand wood carving, or on mediaeval metal-work, or tapestries, or\r\nilluminated MSS.  They were probably very ordinary-looking people, with\r\nnothing grotesque, or remarkable, or fantastic in their appearance.  The\r\nMiddle Ages, as we know them in art, are simply a definite form of style,\r\nand there is no reason at all why an artist with this style should not be\r\nproduced in the nineteenth century.  No great artist ever sees things as\r\nthey really are.  If he did, he would cease to be an artist.  Take an\r\nexample from our own day.  I know that you are fond of Japanese things.\r\nNow, do you really imagine that the Japanese people, as they are\r\npresented to us in art, have any existence?  If you do, you have never\r\nunderstood Japanese art at all.  The Japanese people are the deliberate\r\nself-conscious creation of certain individual artists.  If you set a\r\npicture by Hokusai, or Hokkei, or any of the great native painters,\r\nbeside a real Japanese gentleman or lady, you will see that there is not\r\nthe slightest resemblance between them.  The actual people who live in\r\nJapan are not unlike the general run of English people; that is to say,\r\nthey are extremely commonplace, and have nothing curious or extraordinary\r\nabout them.  In fact the whole of Japan is a pure invention.  There is no\r\nsuch country, there are no such people.  One of our most charming\r\npainters {3} went recently to the Land of the Chrysanthemum in the\r\nfoolish hope of seeing the Japanese.  All he saw, all he had the chance\r\nof painting, were a few lanterns and some fans.  He was quite unable to\r\ndiscover the inhabitants, as his delightful exhibition at Messrs.\r\nDowdeswell's Gallery showed only too well.  He did not know that the\r\nJapanese people are, as I have said, simply a mode of style, an exquisite\r\nfancy of art.  And so, if you desire to see a Japanese effect, you will\r\nnot behave like a tourist and go to Tokio.  On the contrary, you will\r\nstay at home and steep yourself in the work of certain Japanese artists,\r\nand then, when you have absorbed the spirit of their style, and caught\r\ntheir imaginative manner of vision, you will go some afternoon and sit in\r\nthe Park or stroll down Piccadilly, and if you cannot see an absolutely\r\nJapanese effect there, you will not see it anywhere.  Or, to return again\r\nto the past, take as another instance the ancient Greeks.  Do you think\r\nthat Greek art ever tells us what the Greek people were like?  Do you\r\nbelieve that the Athenian women were like the stately dignified figures\r\nof the Parthenon frieze, or like those marvellous goddesses who sat in\r\nthe triangular pediments of the same building?  If you judge from the\r\nart, they certainly were so.  But read an authority, like Aristophanes,\r\nfor instance.  You will find that the Athenian ladies laced tightly, wore\r\nhigh-heeled shoes, dyed their hair yellow, painted and rouged their\r\nfaces, and were exactly like any silly fashionable or fallen creature of\r\nour own day.  The fact is that we look back on the ages entirely through\r\nthe medium of art, and art, very fortunately, has never once told us the\r\ntruth.--_The Decay of Lying_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS GRIFFITHS WAINEWRIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was taken back to Newgate, preparatory to his removal to the colonies.\r\nIn a fanciful passage in one of his early essays he had fancied himself\r\n'lying in Horsemonger Gaol under sentence of death' for having been\r\nunable to resist the temptation of stealing some Marc Antonios from the\r\nBritish Museum in order to complete his collection.  The sentence now\r\npassed on him was to a man of his culture a form of death.  He complained\r\nbitterly of it to his friends, and pointed out, with a good deal of\r\nreason, some people may fancy, that the money was practically his own,\r\nhaving come to him from his mother, and that the forgery, such as it was,\r\nhad been committed thirteen years before, which, to use his own phrase,\r\nwas at least a _circonstance attenuante_.  The permanence of personality\r\nis a very subtle metaphysical problem, and certainly the English law\r\nsolves the question in an extremely rough-and-ready manner.  There is,\r\nhowever, something dramatic in the fact that this heavy punishment was\r\ninflicted on him for what, if we remember his fatal influence on the\r\nprose of modern journalism, was certainly not the worst of all his sins.\r\n\r\nWhile he was in gaol, Dickens, Macready, and Hablot Browne came across\r\nhim by chance.  They had been going over the prisons of London, searching\r\nfor artistic effects, and in Newgate they suddenly caught sight of\r\nWainewright.  He met them with a defiant stare, Forster tells us, but\r\nMacready was 'horrified to recognise a man familiarly known to him in\r\nformer years, and at whose table he had dined.'\r\n\r\nOthers had more curiosity, and his cell was for some time a kind of\r\nfashionable lounge.  Many men of letters went down to visit their old\r\nliterary comrade.  But he was no longer the kind light-hearted Janus whom\r\nCharles Lamb admired.  He seems to have grown quite cynical.\r\n\r\nTo the agent of an insurance company who was visiting him one afternoon,\r\nand thought he would improve the occasion by pointing out that, after\r\nall, crime was a bad speculation, he replied: 'Sir, you City men enter on\r\nyour speculations, and take the chances of them.  Some of your\r\nspeculations succeed, some fail.  Mine happen to have failed, yours\r\nhappen to have succeeded.  That is the only difference, sir, between my\r\nvisitor and me.  But, sir, I will tell you one thing in which I have\r\nsucceeded to the last.  I have been determined through life to hold the\r\nposition of a gentleman.  I have always done so.  I do so still.  It is\r\nthe custom of this place that each of the inmates of a cell shall take\r\nhis morning's turn of sweeping it out.  I occupy a cell with a bricklayer\r\nand a sweep, but they never offer me the broom!'  When a friend\r\nreproached him with the murder of Helen Abercrombie he shrugged his\r\nshoulders and said, 'Yes; it was a dreadful thing to do, but she had very\r\nthick ankles.'--_Pen, Pencil and Poison_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAINEWRIGHT AT HOBART TOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nHis love of art, however, never deserted him.  At Hobart Town he started\r\na studio, and returned to sketching and portrait-painting, and his\r\nconversation and manners seem not to have lost their charm.  Nor did he\r\ngive up his habit of poisoning, and there are two cases on record in\r\nwhich he tried to make away with people who had offended him.  But his\r\nhand seems to have lost its cunning.  Both of his attempts were complete\r\nfailures, and in 1844, being thoroughly dissatisfied with Tasmanian\r\nsociety, he presented a memorial to the governor of the settlement, Sir\r\nJohn Eardley Wilmot, praying for a ticket-of-leave.  In it he speaks of\r\nhimself as being 'tormented by ideas struggling for outward form and\r\nrealisation, barred up from increase of knowledge, and deprived of the\r\nexercise of profitable or even of decorous speech.'  His request,\r\nhowever, was refused, and the associate of Coleridge consoled himself by\r\nmaking those marvellous _Paradis Artificiels_ whose secret is only known\r\nto the eaters of opium.  In 1852 he died of apoplexy, his sole living\r\ncompanion being a cat, for which he had evinced at extraordinary\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nHis crimes seem to have had an important effect upon his art.  They gave\r\na strong personality to his style, a quality that his early work\r\ncertainly lacked.  In a note to the _Life of Dickens_, Forster mentions\r\nthat in 1847 Lady Blessington received from her brother, Major Power, who\r\nheld a military appointment at Hobart Town, an oil portrait of a young\r\nlady from his clever brush; and it is said that 'he had contrived to put\r\nthe expression of his own wickedness into the portrait of a nice, kind-\r\nhearted girl.'  M. Zola, in one of his novels, tells us of a young man\r\nwho, having committed a murder, takes to art, and paints greenish\r\nimpressionist portraits of perfectly respectable people, all of which\r\nbear a curious resemblance to his victim.  The development of Mr.\r\nWainewright's style seems to me far more subtle and suggestive.  One can\r\nfancy an intense personality being created out of sin.--_Pen, Pencil and\r\nPoison_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDINAL NEWMAN AND THE AUTOBIOGRAPHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn literature mere egotism is delightful.  It is what fascinates us in\r\nthe letters of personalities so different as Cicero and Balzac, Flaubert\r\nand Berlioz, Byron and Madame de Sevigne.  Whenever we come across it,\r\nand, strangely enough, it is rather rare, we cannot but welcome it, and\r\ndo not easily forget it.  Humanity will always love Rousseau for having\r\nconfessed his sins, not to a priest, but to the world, and the couchant\r\nnymphs that Cellini wrought in bronze for the castle of King Francis, the\r\ngreen and gold Perseus, even, that in the open Loggia at Florence shows\r\nthe moon the dead terror that once turned life to stone, have not given\r\nit more pleasure than has that autobiography in which the supreme\r\nscoundrel of the Renaissance relates the story of his splendour and his\r\nshame.  The opinions, the character, the achievements of the man, matter\r\nvery little.  He may be a sceptic like the gentle Sieur de Montaigne, or\r\na saint like the bitter son of Monica, but when he tells us his own\r\nsecrets he can always charm our ears to listening and our lips to\r\nsilence.  The mode of thought that Cardinal Newman represented--if that\r\ncan be called a mode of thought which seeks to solve intellectual\r\nproblems by a denial of the supremacy of the intellect--may not, cannot,\r\nI think, survive.  But the world will never weary of watching that\r\ntroubled soul in its progress from darkness to darkness.  The lonely\r\nchurch at Littlemore, where 'the breath of the morning is damp, and\r\nworshippers are few,' will always be dear to it, and whenever men see the\r\nyellow snapdragon blossoming on the wall of Trinity they will think of\r\nthat gracious undergraduate who saw in the flower's sure recurrence a\r\nprophecy that he would abide for ever with the Benign Mother of his\r\ndays--a prophecy that Faith, in her wisdom or her folly, suffered not to\r\nbe fulfilled.  Yes; autobiography is irresistible.--_The Critic as\r\nArtist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT BROWNING\r\n\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole the man was great.  He did not belong to the Olympians,\r\nand had all the incompleteness of the Titan.  He did not survey, and it\r\nwas but rarely that he could sing.  His work is marred by struggle,\r\nviolence and effort, and he passed not from emotion to form, but from\r\nthought to chaos.  Still, he was great.  He has been called a thinker,\r\nand was certainly a man who was always thinking, and always thinking\r\naloud; but it was not thought that fascinated him, but rather the\r\nprocesses by which thought moves.  It was the machine he loved, not what\r\nthe machine makes.  The method by which the fool arrives at his folly was\r\nas dear to him as the ultimate wisdom of the wise.  So much, indeed, did\r\nthe subtle mechanism of mind fascinate him that he despised language, or\r\nlooked upon it as an incomplete instrument of expression.  Rhyme, that\r\nexquisite echo which in the Muse's hollow hill creates and answers its\r\nown voice; rhyme, which in the hands of the real artist becomes not\r\nmerely a material element of metrical beauty, but a spiritual element of\r\nthought and passion also, waking a new mood, it may be, or stirring a\r\nfresh train of ideas, or opening by mere sweetness and suggestion of\r\nsound some golden door at which the Imagination itself had knocked in\r\nvain; rhyme, which can turn man's utterance to the speech of gods; rhyme,\r\nthe one chord we have added to the Greek lyre, became in Robert\r\nBrowning's hands a grotesque, misshapen thing, which at times made him\r\nmasquerade in poetry as a low comedian, and ride Pegasus too often with\r\nhis tongue in his cheek.  There are moments when he wounds us by\r\nmonstrous music.  Nay, if he can only get his music by breaking the\r\nstrings of his lute, he breaks them, and they snap in discord, and no\r\nAthenian tettix, making melody from tremulous wings, lights on the ivory\r\nhorn to make the movement perfect, or the interval less harsh.  Yet, he\r\nwas great: and though he turned language into ignoble clay, he made from\r\nit men and women that live.  He is the most Shakespearian creature since\r\nShakespeare.  If Shakespeare could sing with myriad lips, Browning could\r\nstammer through a thousand mouths.  Even now, as I am speaking, and\r\nspeaking not against him but for him, there glides through the room the\r\npageant of his persons.  There, creeps Fra Lippo Lippi with his cheeks\r\nstill burning from some girl's hot kiss.  There, stands dread Saul with\r\nthe lordly male-sapphires gleaming in his turban.  Mildred Tresham is\r\nthere, and the Spanish monk, yellow with hatred, and Blougram, and Ben\r\nEzra, and the Bishop of St. Praxed's.  The spawn of Setebos gibbers in\r\nthe corner, and Sebald, hearing Pippa pass by, looks on Ottima's haggard\r\nface, and loathes her and his own sin, and himself.  Pale as the white\r\nsatin of his doublet, the melancholy king watches with dreamy treacherous\r\neyes too loyal Strafford pass forth to his doom, and Andrea shudders as\r\nhe hears the cousins whistle in the garden, and bids his perfect wife go\r\ndown.  Yes, Browning was great.  And as what will he be remembered?  As a\r\npoet?  Ah, not as a poet!  He will be remembered as a writer of fiction,\r\nas the most supreme writer of fiction, it may be, that we have ever had.\r\nHis sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled, and, if he could not\r\nanswer his own problems, he could at least put problems forth, and what\r\nmore should an artist do?  Considered from the point of view of a creator\r\nof character he ranks next to him who made Hamlet.  Had he been\r\narticulate, he might have sat beside him.  The only man who can touch the\r\nhem of his garment is George Meredith.  Meredith is a prose Browning, and\r\nso is Browning. He used poetry as a medium for writing in prose.--_The\r\nCritic as Artist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO SUPREME AND HIGHEST ARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLife and Literature, life and the perfect expression of life.  The\r\nprinciples of the former, as laid down by the Greeks, we may not realise\r\nin an age so marred by false ideals as our own.  The principles of the\r\nlatter, as they laid them down, are, in many cases, so subtle that we can\r\nhardly understand them.  Recognising that the most perfect art is that\r\nwhich most fully mirrors man in all his infinite variety, they elaborated\r\nthe criticism of language, considered in the light of the mere material\r\nof that art, to a point to which we, with our accentual system of\r\nreasonable or emotional emphasis, can barely if at all attain; studying,\r\nfor instance, the metrical movements of a prose as scientifically as a\r\nmodern musician studies harmony and counterpoint, and, I need hardly say,\r\nwith much keener aesthetic instinct.  In this they were right, as they\r\nwere right in all things.  Since the introduction of printing, and the\r\nfatal development of the habit of reading amongst the middle and lower\r\nclasses of this country, there has been a tendency in literature to\r\nappeal more and more to the eye, and less and less to the ear which is\r\nreally the sense which, from the standpoint of pure art, it should seek\r\nto please, and by whose canons of pleasure it should abide always.  Even\r\nthe work of Mr. Pater, who is, on the whole, the most perfect master of\r\nEnglish prose now creating amongst us, is often far more like a piece of\r\nmosaic than a passage in music, and seems, here and there, to lack the\r\ntrue rhythmical life of words and the fine freedom and richness of effect\r\nthat such rhythmical life produces.  We, in fact, have made writing a\r\ndefinite mode of composition, and have treated it as a form of elaborate\r\ndesign.  The Greeks, upon the other hand, regarded writing simply as a\r\nmethod of chronicling.  Their test was always the spoken word in its\r\nmusical and metrical relations.  The voice was the medium, and the ear\r\nthe critic.  I have sometimes thought that the story of Homer's blindness\r\nmight be really an artistic myth, created in critical days, and serving\r\nto remind us, not merely that the great poet is always a seer, seeing\r\nless with the eyes of the body than he does with the eyes of the soul,\r\nbut that he is a true singer also, building his song out of music,\r\nrepeating each line over and over again to himself till he has caught the\r\nsecret of its melody, chaunting in darkness the words that are winged\r\nwith light.  Certainly, whether this be so or not, it was to his\r\nblindness, as an occasion, if not as a cause, that England's great poet\r\nowed much of the majestic movement and sonorous splendour of his later\r\nverse.  When Milton could no longer write he began to sing.--_The Critic\r\nas Artist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECRETS OF IMMORTALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the mouldering citadel of Troy lies the lizard like a thing of green\r\nbronze.  The owl has built her nest in the palace of Priam.  Over the\r\nempty plain wander shepherd and goatherd with their flocks, and where, on\r\nthe wine-surfaced, oily sea, [Greek text], as Homer calls it,\r\ncopper-prowed and streaked with vermilion, the great galleys of the\r\nDanaoi came in their gleaming crescent, the lonely tunny-fisher sits in\r\nhis little boat and watches the bobbing corks of his net.  Yet, every\r\nmorning the doors of the city are thrown open, and on foot, or in horse-\r\ndrawn chariot, the warriors go forth to battle, and mock their enemies\r\nfrom behind their iron masks.  All day long the fight rages, and when\r\nnight comes the torches gleam by the tents, and the cresset burns in the\r\nhall.  Those who live in marble or on painted panel, know of life but a\r\nsingle exquisite instant, eternal indeed in its beauty, but limited to\r\none note of passion or one mood of calm.  Those whom the poet makes live\r\nhave their myriad emotions of joy and terror, of courage and despair, of\r\npleasure and of suffering.  The seasons come and go in glad or saddening\r\npageant, and with winged or leaden feet the years pass by before them.\r\nThey have their youth and their manhood, they are children, and they grow\r\nold.  It is always dawn for St. Helena, as Veronese saw her at the\r\nwindow.  Through the still morning air the angels bring her the symbol of\r\nGod's pain.  The cool breezes of the morning lift the gilt threads from\r\nher brow.  On that little hill by the city of Florence, where the lovers\r\nof Giorgione are lying, it is always the solstice of noon, of noon made\r\nso languorous by summer suns that hardly can the slim naked girl dip into\r\nthe marble tank the round bubble of clear glass, and the long fingers of\r\nthe lute-player rest idly upon the chords.  It is twilight always for the\r\ndancing nymphs whom Corot set free among the silver poplars of France.  In\r\neternal twilight they move, those frail diaphanous figures, whose\r\ntremulous white feet seem not to touch the dew-drenched grass they tread\r\non.  But those who walk in epos, drama, or romance, see through the\r\nlabouring months the young moons wax and wane, and watch the night from\r\nevening unto morning star, and from sunrise unto sunsetting can note the\r\nshifting day with all its gold and shadow.  For them, as for us, the\r\nflowers bloom and wither, and the Earth, that Green-tressed Goddess as\r\nColeridge calls her, alters her raiment for their pleasure.  The statue\r\nis concentrated to one moment of perfection.  The image stained upon the\r\ncanvas possesses no spiritual element of growth or change.  If they know\r\nnothing of death, it is because they know little of life, for the secrets\r\nof life and death belong to those, and those only, whom the sequence of\r\ntime affects, and who possess not merely the present but the future, and\r\ncan rise or fall from a past of glory or of shame.  Movement, that\r\nproblem of the visible arts, can be truly realised by Literature alone.\r\nIt is Literature that shows us the body in its swiftness and the soul in\r\nits unrest.--_The Critic as Artist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRITIC AND HIS MATERIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nWho cares whether Mr. Ruskin's views on Turner are sound or not?  What\r\ndoes it matter?  That mighty and majestic prose of his, so fervid and so\r\nfiery-coloured in its noble eloquence, so rich in its elaborate symphonic\r\nmusic, so sure and certain, at its best, in subtle choice of word and\r\nepithet, is at least as great a work of art as any of those wonderful\r\nsunsets that bleach or rot on their corrupted canvases in England's\r\nGallery; greater indeed, one is apt to think at times, not merely because\r\nits equal beauty is more enduring, but on account of the fuller variety\r\nof its appeal, soul speaking to soul in those long-cadenced lines, not\r\nthrough form and colour alone, though through these, indeed, completely\r\nand without loss, but with intellectual and emotional utterance, with\r\nlofty passion and with loftier thought, with imaginative insight, and\r\nwith poetic aim; greater, I always think, even as Literature is the\r\ngreater art.  Who, again, cares whether Mr. Pater has put into the\r\nportrait of Monna Lisa something that Lionardo never dreamed of?  The\r\npainter may have been merely the slave of an archaic smile, as some have\r\nfancied, but whenever I pass into the cool galleries of the Palace of the\r\nLouvre, and stand before that strange figure 'set in its marble chair in\r\nthat cirque of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea,' I\r\nmurmur to myself, 'She is older than the rocks among which she sits; like\r\nthe vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the\r\ngrave; and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day\r\nabout her: and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants; and,\r\nas Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as St. Anne, the mother of\r\nMary; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes,\r\nand lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing\r\nlineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands.'  And I say to my\r\nfriend, 'The presence that thus so strangely rose beside the waters is\r\nexpressive of what in the ways of a thousand years man had come to\r\ndesire'; and he answers me, 'Hers is the head upon which all \"the ends of\r\nthe world are come,\" and the eyelids are a little weary.'\r\n\r\nAnd so the picture becomes more wonderful to us than it really is, and\r\nreveals to us a secret of which, in truth, it knows nothing, and the\r\nmusic of the mystical prose is as sweet in our ears as was that flute-\r\nplayer's music that lent to the lips of La Gioconda those subtle and\r\npoisonous curves.  Do you ask me what Lionardo would have said had any\r\none told him of this picture that 'all the thoughts and experience of the\r\nworld had etched and moulded therein that which they had of power to\r\nrefine and make expressive the outward form, the animalism of Greece, the\r\nlust of Rome, the reverie of the Middle Age with its spiritual ambition\r\nand imaginative loves, the return of the Pagan world, the sins of the\r\nBorgias?'  He would probably have answered that he had contemplated none\r\nof these things, but had concerned himself simply with certain\r\narrangements of lines and masses, and with new and curious\r\ncolour-harmonies of blue and green.  And it is for this very reason that\r\nthe criticism which I have quoted is criticism of the highest kind.  It\r\ntreats the work of art simply as a starting-point for a new creation.  It\r\ndoes not confine itself--let us at least suppose so for the moment--to\r\ndiscovering the real intention of the artist and accepting that as final.\r\nAnd in this it is right, for the meaning of any beautiful created thing\r\nis, at least, as much in the soul of him who looks at it, as it was in\r\nhis soul who wrought it.  Nay, it is rather the beholder who lends to the\r\nbeautiful thing its myriad meanings, and makes it marvellous for us, and\r\nsets it in some new relation to the age, so that it becomes a vital\r\nportion of our lives, and a symbol of what we pray for, or perhaps of\r\nwhat, having prayed for, we fear that we may receive.--_The Critic as\r\nArtist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANTE THE LIVING GUIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no mood or passion that Art cannot give us, and those of us who\r\nhave discovered her secret can settle beforehand what our experiences are\r\ngoing to be.  We can choose our day and select our hour.  We can say to\r\nourselves, 'To-morrow, at dawn, we shall walk with grave Virgil through\r\nthe valley of the shadow of death,' and lo! the dawn finds us in the\r\nobscure wood, and the Mantuan stands by our side.  We pass through the\r\ngate of the legend fatal to hope, and with pity or with joy behold the\r\nhorror of another world.  The hypocrites go by, with their painted faces\r\nand their cowls of gilded lead.  Out of the ceaseless winds that drive\r\nthem, the carnal look at us, and we watch the heretic rending his flesh,\r\nand the glutton lashed by the rain.  We break the withered branches from\r\nthe tree in the grove of the Harpies, and each dull-hued poisonous twig\r\nbleeds with red blood before us, and cries aloud with bitter cries.  Out\r\nof a horn of fire Odysseus speaks to us, and when from his sepulchre of\r\nflame the great Ghibelline rises, the pride that triumphs over the\r\ntorture of that bed becomes ours for a moment.  Through the dim purple\r\nair fly those who have stained the world with the beauty of their sin,\r\nand in the pit of loathsome disease, dropsy-stricken and swollen of body\r\ninto the semblance of a monstrous lute, lies Adamo di Brescia, the coiner\r\nof false coin.  He bids us listen to his misery; we stop, and with dry\r\nand gaping lips he tells us how he dreams day and night of the brooks of\r\nclear water that in cool dewy channels gush down the green Casentine\r\nhills.  Sinon, the false Greek of Troy, mocks at him.  He smites him in\r\nthe face, and they wrangle.  We are fascinated by their shame, and\r\nloiter, till Virgil chides us and leads us away to that city turreted by\r\ngiants where great Nimrod blows his horn.  Terrible things are in store\r\nfor us, and we go to meet them in Dante's raiment and with Dante's heart.\r\nWe traverse the marshes of the Styx, and Argenti swims to the boat\r\nthrough the slimy waves.  He calls to us, and we reject him.  When we\r\nhear the voice of his agony we are glad, and Virgil praises us for the\r\nbitterness of our scorn.  We tread upon the cold crystal of Cocytus, in\r\nwhich traitors stick like straws in glass.  Our foot strikes against the\r\nhead of Bocca.  He will not tell us his name, and we tear the hair in\r\nhandfuls from the screaming skull.  Alberigo prays us to break the ice\r\nupon his face that he may weep a little.  We pledge our word to him, and\r\nwhen he has uttered his dolorous tale we deny the word that we have\r\nspoken, and pass from him; such cruelty being courtesy indeed, for who\r\nmore base than he who has mercy for the condemned of God?  In the jaws of\r\nLucifer we see the man who sold Christ, and in the jaws of Lucifer the\r\nmen who slew Caesar.  We tremble, and come forth to re-behold the\r\nstars.--_The Critic as Artist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIMITATIONS OF GENIUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal of all Art is simply to the artistic temperament.  Art does\r\nnot address herself to the specialist.  Her claim is that she is\r\nuniversal, and that in all her manifestations she is one.  Indeed, so far\r\nfrom its being true that the artist is the best judge of art, a really\r\ngreat artist can never judge of other people's work at all, and can\r\nhardly, in fact, judge of his own.  That very concentration of vision\r\nthat makes a man an artist, limits by its sheer intensity his faculty of\r\nfine appreciation.  The energy of creation hurries him blindly on to his\r\nown goal.  The wheels of his chariot raise the dust as a cloud around\r\nhim.  The gods are hidden from each other.  They can recognise their\r\nworshippers.  That is all . . . Wordsworth saw in _Endymion_ merely a\r\npretty piece of Paganism, and Shelley, with his dislike of actuality, was\r\ndeaf to Wordsworth's message, being repelled by its form, and Byron, that\r\ngreat passionate human incomplete creature, could appreciate neither the\r\npoet of the cloud nor the poet of the lake, and the wonder of Keats was\r\nhidden from him.  The realism of Euripides was hateful to Sophokles.\r\nThose droppings of warm tears had no music for him.  Milton, with his\r\nsense of the grand style, could not understand the method of Shakespeare,\r\nany more than could Sir Joshua the method of Gainsborough.  Bad artists\r\nalways admire each other's work.  They call it being large-minded and\r\nfree from prejudice.  But a truly great artist cannot conceive of life\r\nbeing shown, or beauty fashioned, under any conditions other than those\r\nthat he has selected.  Creation employs all its critical faculty within\r\nits own sphere.  It may not use it in the sphere that belongs to others.\r\nIt is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is the proper judge\r\nof it.--_The Critic as Artist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWANTED A NEW BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who would stir us now by fiction must either give us an entirely new\r\nbackground, or reveal to us the soul of man in its innermost workings.\r\nThe first is for the moment being done for us by Mr. Rudyard Kipling.  As\r\none turns over the pages of his _Plain Tales from the Hills_, one feels\r\nas if one were seated under a palm-tree reading life by superb flashes of\r\nvulgarity.  The bright colours of the bazaars dazzle one's eyes.  The\r\njaded, second-rate Anglo-Indians are in exquisite incongruity with their\r\nsurroundings.  The mere lack of style in the story-teller gives an odd\r\njournalistic realism to what he tells us.  From the point of view of\r\nliterature Mr. Kipling is a genius who drops his aspirates.  From the\r\npoint of view of life, he is a reporter who knows vulgarity better than\r\nany one has ever known it.  Dickens knew its clothes and its comedy.  Mr.\r\nKipling knows its essence and its seriousness.  He is our first authority\r\non the second-rate, and has seen marvellous things through keyholes, and\r\nhis backgrounds are real works of art.  As for the second condition, we\r\nhave had Browning, and Meredith is with us.  But there is still much to\r\nbe done in the sphere of introspection.  People sometimes say that\r\nfiction is getting too morbid.  As far as psychology is concerned, it has\r\nnever been morbid enough.  We have merely touched the surface of the\r\nsoul, that is all.  In one single ivory cell of the brain there are\r\nstored away things more marvellous and more terrible than even they have\r\ndreamed of, who, like the author of _Le Rouge et le Noir_, have sought to\r\ntrack the soul into its most secret places, and to make life confess its\r\ndearest sins.  Still, there is a limit even to the number of untried\r\nbackgrounds, and it is possible that a further development of the habit\r\nof introspection may prove fatal to that creative faculty to which it\r\nseeks to supply fresh material.  I myself am inclined to think that\r\ncreation is doomed.  It springs from too primitive, too natural an\r\nimpulse.  However this may be, it is certain that the subject-matter at\r\nthe disposal of creation is always diminishing, while the subject-matter\r\nof criticism increases daily.  There are always new attitudes for the\r\nmind, and new points of view.  The duty of imposing form upon chaos does\r\nnot grow less as the world advances.  There was never a time when\r\nCriticism was more needed than it is now.  It is only by its means that\r\nHumanity can become conscious of the point at which it has arrived.--_The\r\nCritic as Artist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITHOUT FRONTIERS\r\n\r\n\r\nGoethe--you will not misunderstand what I say--was a German of the\r\nGermans.  He loved his country--no man more so.  Its people were dear to\r\nhim; and he led them.  Yet, when the iron hoof of Napoleon trampled upon\r\nvineyard and cornfield, his lips were silent.  'How can one write songs\r\nof hatred without hating?' he said to Eckermann, 'and how could I, to\r\nwhom culture and barbarism are alone of importance, hate a nation which\r\nis among the most cultivated of the earth and to which I owe so great a\r\npart of my own cultivation?'  This note, sounded in the modern world by\r\nGoethe first, will become, I think, the starting point for the\r\ncosmopolitanism of the future.  Criticism will annihilate\r\nrace-prejudices, by insisting upon the unity of the human mind in the\r\nvariety of its forms.  If we are tempted to make war upon another nation,\r\nwe shall remember that we are seeking to destroy an element of our own\r\nculture, and possibly its most important element.  As long as war is\r\nregarded as wicked, it will always have its fascination.  When it is\r\nlooked upon as vulgar, it will cease to be popular.  The change will of\r\ncourse be slow, and people will not be conscious of it.  They will not\r\nsay 'We will not war against France because her prose is perfect,' but\r\nbecause the prose of France is perfect, they will not hate the land.\r\nIntellectual criticism will bind Europe together in bonds far closer than\r\nthose that can be forged by shopman or sentimentalist.  It will give us\r\nthe peace that springs from understanding.--_The Critic as Artist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POETRY OF ARCHAEOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nInfessura tells us that in 1485 some workmen digging on the Appian Way\r\ncame across an old Roman sarcophagus inscribed with the name 'Julia,\r\ndaughter of Claudius.'  On opening the coffer they found within its\r\nmarble womb the body of a beautiful girl of about fifteen years of age,\r\npreserved by the embalmer's skill from corruption and the decay of time.\r\nHer eyes were half open, her hair rippled round her in crisp curling\r\ngold, and from her lips and cheek the bloom of maidenhood had not yet\r\ndeparted.  Borne back to the Capitol, she became at once the centre of a\r\nnew cult, and from all parts of the city crowded pilgrims to worship at\r\nthe wonderful shrine, till the Pope, fearing lest those who had found the\r\nsecret of beauty in a Pagan tomb might forget what secrets Judaea's rough\r\nand rock-hewn sepulchre contained, had the body conveyed away by night,\r\nand in secret buried.  Legend though it may be, yet the story is none the\r\nless valuable as showing us the attitude of the Renaissance towards the\r\nantique world.  Archaeology to them was not a mere science for the\r\nantiquarian; it was a means by which they could touch the dry dust of\r\nantiquity into the very breath and beauty of life, and fill with the new\r\nwine of romanticism forms that else had been old and outworn.  From the\r\npulpit of Niccola Pisano down to Mantegna's 'Triumph of Caesar,' and the\r\nservice Cellini designed for King Francis, the influence of this spirit\r\ncan be traced; nor was it confined merely to the immobile arts--the arts\r\nof arrested movement--but its influence was to be seen also in the great\r\nGraeco-Roman masques which were the constant amusement of the gay courts\r\nof the time, and in the public pomps and processions with which the\r\ncitizens of big commercial towns were wont to greet the princes that\r\nchanced to visit them; pageants, by the way, which were considered so\r\nimportant that large prints were made of them and published--a fact which\r\nis a proof of the general interest at the time in matters of such\r\nkind.--_The Truth of Masks_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF ARCHAEOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed archaeology is only really delightful when transfused into some\r\nform of art.  I have no desire to underrate the services of laborious\r\nscholars, but I feel that the use Keats made of Lempriere's Dictionary is\r\nof far more value to us than Professor Max Muller's treatment of the same\r\nmythology as a disease of language.  Better _Endymion_ than any theory,\r\nhowever sound, or, as in the present instance, unsound, of an epidemic\r\namong adjectives!  And who does not feel that the chief glory of\r\nPiranesi's book on Vases is that it gave Keats the suggestion for his\r\n'Ode on a Grecian Urn'?  Art, and art only, can make archaeology\r\nbeautiful; and the theatric art can use it most directly and most\r\nvividly, for it can combine in one exquisite presentation the illusion of\r\nactual life with the wonder of the unreal world.  But the sixteenth\r\ncentury was not merely the age of Vitruvius; it was the age of Vecellio\r\nalso.  Every nation seems suddenly to have become interested in the dress\r\nof its neighbours.  Europe began to investigate its own clothes, and the\r\namount of books published on national costumes is quite extraordinary.  At\r\nthe beginning of the century the _Nuremberg Chronicle_, with its two\r\nthousand illustrations, reached its fifth edition, and before the century\r\nwas over seventeen editions were published of Munster's _Cosmography_.\r\nBesides these two books there were also the works of Michael Colyns, of\r\nHans Weigel, of Amman, and of Vecellio himself, all of them well\r\nillustrated, some of the drawings in Vecellio being probably from the\r\nhand of Titian.\r\n\r\nNor was it merely from books and treatises that they acquired their\r\nknowledge.  The development of the habit of foreign travel, the increased\r\ncommercial intercourse between countries, and the frequency of diplomatic\r\nmissions, gave every nation many opportunities of studying the various\r\nforms of contemporary dress.  After the departure from England, for\r\ninstance, of the ambassadors from the Czar, the Sultan and the Prince of\r\nMorocco, Henry the Eighth and his friends gave several masques in the\r\nstrange attire of their visitors.  Later on London saw, perhaps too\r\noften, the sombre splendour of the Spanish Court, and to Elizabeth came\r\nenvoys from all lands, whose dress, Shakespeare tells us, had an\r\nimportant influence on English costume.--_The Truth of Masks_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEROD SUPPLIANT\r\n\r\n\r\nNon, non, vous ne voulez pas cela.  Vous me dites cela seulement pour me\r\nfaire de la peine, parce que je vous ai regardee pendant toute la soiree.\r\nEh! bien, oui.  Je vous ai regardee pendant toute la soiree.  Votre\r\nbeaute m'a trouble.  Votre beaute m'a terriblement trouble, et je vous ai\r\ntrop regardee.  Mais je ne le ferai plus.  Il ne faut regarder ni les\r\nchoses ni les personnes.  Il ne faut regarder que dans les miroirs.  Car\r\nles miroirs ne nous montrent que des masques . . . Oh!  Oh! du vin! j'ai\r\nsoif . . . Salome, Salome, soyons amis.  Enfin, voyez . . . Qu'est-ce que\r\nje voulais dire?  Qu'est-ce que c'etait?  Ah! je m'en souviens! . . .\r\nSalome!  Non, venez plus pres de moi.  J'ai peur que vous ne m'entendiez\r\npas . . . Salome, vous connaissez mes paons blancs, mes beaux paons\r\nblancs, qui se promenent dans le jardin entre les myrtes et les grands\r\ncypres.  Leurs becs sont dores, et les grains qu'ils mangent sont dores\r\naussi, et leurs pieds sont teints de pourpre.  La pluie vient quand ils\r\ncrient, et quand ils se pavanent la lune se montre au ciel.  Ils vont\r\ndeux a deux entre les cypres et les myrtes noirs et chacun a son esclave\r\npour le soigner.  Quelquefois ils volent a travers les arbres, et\r\nquelquefois ils couchent sur le gazon et autour de l'etang.  Il n'y a pas\r\ndans le monde d'oiseaux si merveilleux.  Il n'y a aucun roi du monde qui\r\npossede des oiseaux aussi merveilleux.  Je suis sur que meme Cesar ne\r\npossede pas d'oiseaux aussi beaux.  Eh bien! je vous donnerai cinquante\r\nde mes paons.  Ils vous suivront partout, et au milieu d'eux vous serez\r\ncomme la lune dans un grand nuage blanc . . . Je vous les donnerai tous.\r\nJe n'en ai que cent, et il n'y a aucun roi du monde qui possede des paons\r\ncomme les miens, mais je vous les donnerai tous.  Seulement, il faut me\r\ndelier de ma parole et ne pas me demander ce que vous m'avez\r\ndemande.--_Salome_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TETRARCH'S REMORSE\r\n\r\n\r\nSalome, pensez a ce que vous faites.  Cet homme vient peut-etre de Dieu.\r\nJe suis sur qu'il vient de Dieu.  C'est un saint homme.  Le doigt de Dieu\r\nl'a touche.  Dieu a mis dans sa bouche des mots terribles.  Dans le\r\npalais, comme dans le desert, Dieu est toujours avec lui . . . Au moins,\r\nc'est possible.  On ne sait pas, mais il est possible que Dieu soit pour\r\nlui et avec lui.  Aussi peut-etre que s'il mourrait, il m'arriverait un\r\nmalheur.  Enfin, il a dit que le jour ou il mourrait il arriverait un\r\nmalheur a quelqu'un.  Ce ne peut etre qu'a moi.  Souvenez-vous, j'ai\r\nglisse dans le sang quand je suis entre ici.  Aussi j'ai entendu un\r\nbattement d'ailes dans l'air, un battement d'ailes gigantesques.  Ce sont\r\nde tres mauvais presages.  Et il y en avait d'autres.  Je suis sur qu'il\r\ny en avait d'autres, quoique je ne les aie pas vus.  Eh bien!  Salome,\r\nvous ne voulez pas qu'un malheur m'arrive?  Vous ne voulez pas\r\ncela.--_Salome_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TETRARCH'S TREASURE\r\n\r\n\r\nMoi, je suis tres calme.  Je suis tout a fait calme.  Ecoutez.  J'ai des\r\nbijoux caches ici que meme votre mere n'a jamais vus, des bijoux tout a\r\nfait extraordinaires.  J'ai un collier de perles a quatre rangs.  On\r\ndirait des lunes enchainees de rayons d'argent.  On dirait cinquante\r\nlunes captives dans un filet d'or.  Une reine l'a porte sur l'ivoire de\r\nses seins.  Toi, quand tu le porteras, tu seras aussi belle qu'une reine.\r\nJ'ai des amethystes de deux especes.  Une qui est noire comme le vin.\r\nL'autre qui est rouge comme du vin qu'on a colore avec de l'eau.  J'ai\r\ndes topazes jaunes comme les yeux des tigres, et des topazes roses comme\r\nles yeux des pigeons, et des topazes vertes comme les yeux des chats.\r\nJ'ai des opales qui brulent toujours avec une flamme qui est tres froide,\r\ndes opales qui attristent les esprits et ont peur des tenebres.  J'ai des\r\nonyx semblables aux prunelles d'une morte.  J'ai des selenites qui\r\nchangent quand la lune change et deviennent pales quand elles voient le\r\nsoleil.  J'ai des saphirs grands comme des oeufs et bleus comme des\r\nfleurs bleues.  La mer erre dedans, et la lune ne vient jamais troubler\r\nle bleu de ses flots.  J'ai des chrysolithes et des beryls, j'ai des\r\nchrysoprases et des rubis, j'ai des sardonyx et des hyacinthes, et des\r\ncalcedoines et je vous les donnerai tous, mais tous, et j'ajouterai\r\nd'autres choses.  Le roi des Indes vient justement de m'envoyer quatre\r\neventails faits de plumes de perroquets, et le roi de Numidie une robe\r\nfaite de plumes d'autruche.  J'ai un cristal qu'il n'est pas permis aux\r\nfemmes de voir et que meme les jeunes hommes ne doivent regarder qu'apres\r\navoir ete flagelles de verges.  Dans un coffret de nacre j'ai trois\r\nturquoises merveilleuses.  Quand on les porte sur le front on peut\r\nimaginer des choses qui n'existent pas, et quand on les porte dans la\r\nmain on peut rendre les femmes steriles.  Ce sont des tresors de grande\r\nvaleur.  Ce sont des tresors sans prix.  Et ce n'est pas tout.  Dans un\r\ncoffret d'ebene j'ai deux coupes d'ambre qui ressemblent a des pommes\r\nd'or.  Si un ennemi verse du poison dans ces coupes elles deviennent\r\ncomme des pommes d'argent.  Dans un coffret incruste d'ambre j'ai des\r\nsandales incrustees de verre.  J'ai des manteaux qui viennent du pays des\r\nSeres et des bracelets garnis d'escarboucles et de jade qui viennent de\r\nla ville d'Euphrate. . . Enfin, que veux-tu, Salome?  Dis-moi ce que tu\r\ndesires et je te le donnerai.  Je te donnerai tout ce que tu demanderas,\r\nsauf une chose.  Je te donnerai tout ce que je possede, sauf une vie.  Je\r\nte donnerai le manteau du grand pretre.  Je te donnerai le voile du\r\nsanctuaire.--_Salome_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALOME ANTICIPATES DR. STRAUSS\r\n\r\n\r\nAh! tu n'as pas voulu me laisser baiser ta bouche, Iokanaan.  Eh bien! je\r\nla baiserai maintenant.  Je la mordrai avec mes dents comme on mord un\r\nfruit mur.  Oui, je baiserai ta bouche, Iokanaan.  Je te l'ai dit, n'est-\r\nce pas? je te l'ai dit.  Eh bien! je la baiserai maintenant . . . Mais\r\npourquoi ne me regardes-tu pas, Iokanaan?  Tes yeux qui etaient si\r\nterribles, qui etaient si pleins de colere et de mepris, ils sont fermes\r\nmaintenant.  Pourquoi sont-ils fermes?  Ouvre tes yeux!  Souleve tes\r\npaupieres, Iokanaan.  Pourquoi ne me regardes-tu pas?  As-tu peur de moi,\r\nIokanaan, que tu ne veux pas me regarder? . . . Et ta langue qui etait\r\ncomme un serpent rouge dardant des poisons, elle ne remue plus, elle ne\r\ndit rien maintenant, Iokanaan, cette vipere rouge qui a vomi son venin\r\nsur moi.  C'est etrange, n'est-ce pas?  Comment se fait-il que la vipere\r\nrouge ne remue plus? . . . Tu n'as pas voulu de moi, Iokanaan.  Tu m'as\r\nrejetee.  Tu m'as dit des choses infames.  Tu m'as traitee comme une\r\ncourtisane, comme une prostituee, moi, Salome, fille d'Herodias,\r\nPrincesse de Judee!  Eh bien, Iokanaan, moi je vis encore, mais toi tu es\r\nmort et ta tete m'appartient.  Je puis en faire ce que je veux.  Je puis\r\nla jeter aux chiens et aux oiseaux de l'air.  Ce que laisseront les\r\nchiens, les oiseaux de l'air le mangeront . . . Ah! Iokanaan, Iokanaan,\r\ntu as ete le seul homme que j'ai aime.  Tous les autres hommes\r\nm'inspirent du degout.  Mais, toi, tu etais beau.  Ton corps etait une\r\ncolonne d'ivoire sur un socle d'argent.  C'etait un jardin plein de\r\ncolombes et de lis d'argent.  C'etait une tour d'argent ornee de\r\nboucliers d'ivoire.  Il n'y avait rien au monde d'aussi blanc que ton\r\ncorps.  Il n'y avait rien au monde d'aussi noir que tes cheveux.  Dans le\r\nmonde tout entier il n'y avait rien d'aussi rouge que ta bouche.  Ta voix\r\netait un encensoir qui repandait d'etranges parfums, et quand je te\r\nregardais j'entendais une musique etrange!  Ah! pourquoi ne m'as-tu pas\r\nregardee, Iokanaan?  Derriere tes mains et tes blasphemes tu as cache ton\r\nvisage.  Tu as mis sur tes yeux le bandeau de celui qui veut voir son\r\nDieu.  Eh bien, tu l'as vu, ton Dieu, Iokanaan, mais moi, moi . . . tu ne\r\nm'as jamais vue.  Si tu m'avais vue, tu m'aurais aimee.  Moi, je t'ai vu,\r\nIokanaan, et je t'ai aime.  Oh! comme je t'ai aime.  Je t'aime encore,\r\nIokanaan.  Je n'aime que toi . . . J'ai soif de ta beaute.  J'ai faim de\r\nton corps.  Et ni le vin, ni les fruits ne peuvent apaiser mon desir.  Que\r\nferai-je, Iokanaan, maintenant?  Ni les fleuves ni les grandes eaux, ne\r\npourraient eteindre ma passion.  J'etais une Princesse, tu m'as\r\ndedaignee.  J'etais une vierge, tu m'as defloree.  J'etais chaste, tu as\r\nrempli mes veines de feu . . . Ah!  Ah! pourquoi ne m'as-tu pas regardee,\r\nIokanaan?  Si tu m'avais regardee tu m'aurais aimee.  Je sais bien que tu\r\nm'aurais aimee, et le mystere de l'amour est plus grand que le mystere de\r\nla mort.  Il ne faut regarder que l'amour.--_Salome_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG KING\r\n\r\n\r\nAll rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination for him,\r\nand in his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many merchants,\r\nsome to traffic for amber with the rough fisher-folk of the north seas,\r\nsome to Egypt to look for that curious green turquoise which is found\r\nonly in the tombs of kings, and is said to possess magical properties,\r\nsome to Persia for silken carpets and painted pottery, and others to\r\nIndia to buy gauze and stained ivory, moonstones and bracelets of jade,\r\nsandal-wood and blue enamel and shawls of fine wool.\r\n\r\nBut what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his\r\ncoronation, the robe of tissued gold, and the ruby-studded crown, and the\r\nsceptre with its rows and rings of pearls.  Indeed, it was of this that\r\nhe was thinking to-night, as he lay back on his luxurious couch, watching\r\nthe great pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth.\r\nThe designs, which were from the hands of the most famous artists of the\r\ntime, had been submitted to him many months before, and he had given\r\norders that the artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out,\r\nand that the whole world was to be searched for jewels that would be\r\nworthy of their work.  He saw himself in fancy standing at the high altar\r\nof the cathedral in the fair raiment of a King, and a smile played and\r\nlingered about his boyish lips, and lit up with a bright lustre his dark\r\nwoodland eyes.\r\n\r\nAfter some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the carved\r\npenthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly-lit room.  The walls\r\nwere hung with rich tapestries representing the Triumph of Beauty.  A\r\nlarge press, inlaid with agate and lapis-lazuli, filled one corner, and\r\nfacing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels\r\nof powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets\r\nof Venetian glass, and a cup of dark-veined onyx.  Pale poppies were\r\nbroidered on the silk coverlet of the bed, as though they had fallen from\r\nthe tired hands of sleep, and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the\r\nvelvet canopy, from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang, like\r\nwhite foam, to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling.  A laughing\r\nNarcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its head.  On the\r\ntable stood a flat bowl of amethyst.\r\n\r\nOutside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral, looming like a\r\nbubble over the shadowy houses, and the weary sentinels pacing up and\r\ndown on the misty terrace by the river.  Far away, in an orchard, a\r\nnightingale was singing.  A faint perfume of jasmine came through the\r\nopen window.  He brushed his brown curls back from his forehead, and\r\ntaking up a lute, let his fingers stray across the cords.  His heavy\r\neyelids drooped, and a strange languor came over him.  Never before had\r\nhe felt so keenly, or with such exquisite joy, the magic and the mystery\r\nof beautiful things.\r\n\r\nWhen midnight sounded from the clock-tower he touched a bell, and his\r\npages entered and disrobed him with much ceremony, pouring rose-water\r\nover his hands, and strewing flowers on his pillow.  A few moments after\r\nthat they had left the room, he fell asleep.--_The Young King_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CORONATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when the Bishop had heard them he knit his brows, and said, 'My son,\r\nI am an old man, and in the winter of my days, and I know that many evil\r\nthings are done in the wide world.  The fierce robbers come down from the\r\nmountains, and carry off the little children, and sell them to the Moors.\r\nThe lions lie in wait for the caravans, and leap upon the camels.  The\r\nwild boar roots up the corn in the valley, and the foxes gnaw the vines\r\nupon the hill.  The pirates lay waste the sea-coast and burn the ships of\r\nthe fishermen, and take their nets from them.  In the salt-marshes live\r\nthe lepers; they have houses of wattled reeds, and none may come nigh\r\nthem.  The beggars wander through the cities, and eat their food with the\r\ndogs.  Canst thou make these things not to be?  Wilt thou take the leper\r\nfor thy bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy board?  Shall the lion do\r\nthy bidding, and the wild boar obey thee?  Is not He who made misery\r\nwiser than thou art?  Wherefore I praise thee not for this that thou hast\r\ndone, but I bid thee ride back to the Palace and make thy face glad, and\r\nput on the raiment that beseemeth a king, and with the crown of gold I\r\nwill crown thee, and the sceptre of pearl will I place in thy hand.  And\r\nas for thy dreams, think no more of them.  The burden of this world is\r\ntoo great for one man to bear, and the world's sorrow too heavy for one\r\nheart to suffer.'\r\n\r\n'Sayest thou that in this house?' said the young King, and he strode past\r\nthe Bishop, and climbed up the steps of the altar, and stood before the\r\nimage of Christ.\r\n\r\nHe stood before the image of Christ, and on his right hand and on his\r\nleft were the marvellous vessels of gold, the chalice with the yellow\r\nwine, and the vial with the holy oil.  He knelt before the image of\r\nChrist, and the great candles burned brightly by the jewelled shrine, and\r\nthe smoke of the incense curled in thin blue wreaths through the dome.  He\r\nbowed his head in prayer, and the priests in their stiff copes crept away\r\nfrom the altar.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside, and in entered\r\nthe nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes, and shields of polished\r\nsteel.  'Where is this dreamer of dreams?' they cried.  'Where is this\r\nKing who is apparelled like a beggar--this boy who brings shame upon our\r\nstate?  Surely we will slay him, for he is unworthy to rule over us.'\r\n\r\nAnd the young King bowed his head again, and prayed, and when he had\r\nfinished his prayer he rose up, and turning round he looked at them\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! through the painted windows came the sunlight streaming upon him,\r\nand the sun-beams wove round him a tissued robe that was fairer than the\r\nrobe that had been fashioned for his pleasure.  The dead staff blossomed,\r\nand bare lilies that were whiter than pearls.  The dry thorn blossomed,\r\nand bare roses that were redder than rubies.  Whiter than fine pearls\r\nwere the lilies, and their stems were of bright silver.  Redder than male\r\nrubies were the roses, and their leaves were of beaten gold.\r\n\r\nHe stood there in the raiment of a king, and the gates of the jewelled\r\nshrine flew open, and from the crystal of the many-rayed monstrance shone\r\na marvellous and mystical light.  He stood there in a king's raiment, and\r\nthe Glory of God filled the place, and the saints in their carven niches\r\nseemed to move.  In the fair raiment of a king he stood before them, and\r\nthe organ pealed out its music, and the trumpeters blew upon their\r\ntrumpets, and the singing boys sang.\r\n\r\nAnd the people fell upon their knees in awe, and the nobles sheathed\r\ntheir swords and did homage, and the Bishop's face grew pale, and his\r\nhands trembled.  'A greater than I hath crowned thee,' he cried, and he\r\nknelt before him.\r\n\r\nAnd the young King came down from the high altar, and passed home through\r\nthe midst of the people.  But no man dared look upon his face, for it was\r\nlike the face of an angel.--_The Young King_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING OF SPAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a window in the palace the sad melancholy King watched them.  Behind\r\nhim stood his brother, Don Pedro of Aragon, whom he hated, and his\r\nconfessor, the Grand Inquisitor of Granada, sat by his side.  Sadder even\r\nthan usual was the King, for as he looked at the Infanta bowing with\r\nchildish gravity to the assembling counters, or laughing behind her fan\r\nat the grim Duchess of Albuquerque who always accompanied her, he thought\r\nof the young Queen, her mother, who but a short time before--so it seemed\r\nto him--had come from the gay country of France, and had withered away in\r\nthe sombre splendour of the Spanish court, dying just six months after\r\nthe birth of her child, and before she had seen the almonds blossom twice\r\nin the orchard, or plucked the second year's fruit from the old gnarled\r\nfig-tree that stood in the centre of the now grass-grown courtyard.  So\r\ngreat had been his love for her that he had not suffered even the grave\r\nto hide her from him.  She had been embalmed by a Moorish physician, who\r\nin return for this service had been granted his life, which for heresy\r\nand suspicion of magical practices had been already forfeited, men said,\r\nto the Holy Office, and her body was still lying on its tapestried bier\r\nin the black marble chapel of the Palace, just as the monks had borne her\r\nin on that windy March day nearly twelve years before.  Once every month\r\nthe King, wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled lantern in his hand,\r\nwent in and knelt by her side calling out, '_Mi reina_!  _Mi reina_!' and\r\nsometimes breaking through the formal etiquette that in Spain governs\r\nevery separate action of life, and sets limits even to the sorrow of a\r\nKing, he would clutch at the pale jewelled hands in a wild agony of\r\ngrief, and try to wake by his mad kisses the cold painted face.\r\n\r\nTo-day he seemed to see her again, as he had seen her first at the Castle\r\nof Fontainebleau, when he was but fifteen years of age, and she still\r\nyounger.  They had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the Papal\r\nNuncio in the presence of the French King and all the Court, and he had\r\nreturned to the Escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow\r\nhair, and the memory of two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand\r\nas he stepped into his carriage.  Later on had followed the marriage,\r\nhastily performed at Burgos, a small town on the frontier between the two\r\ncountries, and the grand public entry into Madrid with the customary\r\ncelebration of high mass at the Church of La Atocha, and a more than\r\nusually solemn _auto-da-fe_, in which nearly three hundred heretics,\r\namongst whom were many Englishmen, had been delivered over to the secular\r\narm to be burned.\r\n\r\nCertainly he had loved her madly, and to the ruin, many thought, of his\r\ncountry, then at war with England for the possession of the empire of the\r\nNew World.  He had hardly ever permitted her to be out of his sight; for\r\nher, he had forgotten, or seemed to have forgotten, all grave affairs of\r\nState; and, with that terrible blindness that passion brings upon its\r\nservants, he had failed to notice that the elaborate ceremonies by which\r\nhe sought to please her did but aggravate the strange malady from which\r\nshe suffered.  When she died he was, for a time, like one bereft of\r\nreason.  Indeed, there is no doubt but that he would have formally\r\nabdicated and retired to the great Trappist monastery at Granada, of\r\nwhich he was already titular Prior, had he not been afraid to leave the\r\nlittle Infanta at the mercy of his brother, whose cruelty, even in Spain,\r\nwas notorious, and who was suspected by many of having caused the Queen's\r\ndeath by means of a pair of poisoned gloves that he had presented to her\r\non the occasion of her visiting his castle in Aragon.  Even after the\r\nexpiration of the three years of public mourning that he had ordained\r\nthroughout his whole dominions by royal edict, he would never suffer his\r\nministers to speak about any new alliance, and when the Emperor himself\r\nsent to him, and offered him the hand of the lovely Archduchess of\r\nBohemia, his niece, in marriage, he bade the ambassadors tell their\r\nmaster that the King of Spain was already wedded to Sorrow, and that\r\nthough she was but a barren bride he loved her better than Beauty; an\r\nanswer that cost his crown the rich provinces of the Netherlands, which\r\nsoon after, at the Emperor's instigation, revolted against him under the\r\nleadership of some fanatics of the Reformed Church.--_The Birthday of the\r\nInfranta_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BULL FIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nA procession of noble boys, fantastically dressed as _toreadors_, came\r\nout to meet her, and the young Count of Tierra-Nueva, a wonderfully\r\nhandsome lad of about fourteen years of age, uncovering his head with all\r\nthe grace of a born hidalgo and grandee of Spain, led her solemnly in to\r\na little gilt and ivory chair that was placed on a raised dais above the\r\narena.  The children grouped themselves all round, fluttering their big\r\nfans and whispering to each other, and Don Pedro and the Grand Inquisitor\r\nstood laughing at the entrance.  Even the Duchess--the Camerera-Mayor as\r\nshe was called--a thin, hard-featured woman with a yellow ruff, did not\r\nlook quite so bad-tempered as usual, and something like a chill smile\r\nflitted across her wrinkled face and twitched her thin bloodless lips.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was a marvellous bull-fight, and much nicer, the Infanta\r\nthought, than the real bull-fight that she had been brought to see at\r\nSeville, on the occasion of the visit of the Duke of Parma to her father.\r\nSome of the boys pranced about on richly-caparisoned hobby-horses\r\nbrandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands attached\r\nto them; others went on foot waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull,\r\nand vaulting lightly over the barrier when he charged them; and as for\r\nthe bull himself, he was just like a live bull, though he was only made\r\nof wicker-work and stretched hide, and sometimes insisted on running\r\nround the arena on his hind legs, which no live bull ever dreams of\r\ndoing.  He made a splendid fight of it too, and the children got so\r\nexcited that they stood up upon the benches, and waved their lace\r\nhandkerchiefs and cried out: _Bravo toro_!  _Bravo toro_! just as\r\nsensibly as if they had been grown-up people.  At last, however, after a\r\nprolonged combat, during which several of the hobby-horses were gored\r\nthrough and through, and, their riders dismounted, the young Count of\r\nTierra-Nueva brought the bull to his knees, and having obtained\r\npermission from the Infanta to give the _coup de grace_, he plunged his\r\nwooden sword into the neck of the animal with such violence that the head\r\ncame right off, and disclosed the laughing face of little Monsieur de\r\nLorraine, the son of the French Ambassador at Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe arena was then cleared amidst much applause, and the dead\r\nhobby-horses dragged solemnly away by two Moorish pages in yellow and\r\nblack liveries, and after a short interlude, during which a French\r\nposture-master performed upon the tightrope, some Italian puppets\r\nappeared in the semi-classical tragedy of _Sophonisba_ on the stage of a\r\nsmall theatre that had been built up for the purpose.  They acted so\r\nwell, and their gestures were so extremely natural, that at the close of\r\nthe play the eyes of the Infanta were quite dim with tears.  Indeed some\r\nof the children really cried, and had to be comforted with sweetmeats,\r\nand the Grand Inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not help\r\nsaying to Don Pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made\r\nsimply out of wood and coloured wax, and worked mechanically by wires,\r\nshould be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunes.--_The\r\nBirthday of the Infanta_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a throne-room, used for the reception of foreign ambassadors, when\r\nthe King, which of late had not been often, consented to give them a\r\npersonal audience; the same room in which, many years before, envoys had\r\nappeared from England to make arrangements for the marriage of their\r\nQueen, then one of the Catholic sovereigns of Europe, with the Emperor's\r\neldest son.  The hangings were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt\r\nchandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the\r\nblack and white ceiling.  Underneath a great canopy of gold cloth, on\r\nwhich the lions and towers of Castile were broidered in seed pearls,\r\nstood the throne itself, covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded\r\nwith silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls.  On\r\nthe second step of the throne was placed the kneeling-stool of the\r\nInfanta, with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue, and below that\r\nagain, and beyond the limit of the canopy, stood the chair for the Papal\r\nNuncio, who alone had the right to be seated in the King's presence on\r\nthe occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose Cardinal's hat, with its\r\ntangled scarlet tassels, lay on a purple _tabouret_ in front.  On the\r\nwall, facing the throne, hung a life-sized portrait of Charles V. in\r\nhunting dress, with a great mastiff by his side, and a picture of Philip\r\nII. receiving the homage of the Netherlands occupied the centre of the\r\nother wall.  Between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet, inlaid with\r\nplates of ivory, on which the figures from Holbein's Dance of Death had\r\nbeen graved--by the hand, some said, of that famous master himself.\r\n\r\nBut the little Dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence.  He would\r\nnot have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy, nor one white\r\npetal of his rose for the throne itself.  What he wanted was to see the\r\nInfanta before she went down to the pavilion, and to ask her to come away\r\nwith him when he had finished his dance.  Here, in the Palace, the air\r\nwas close and heavy, but in the forest the wind blew free, and the\r\nsunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside.\r\nThere were flowers, too, in the forest, not so splendid, perhaps, as the\r\nflowers in the garden, but more sweetly scented for all that; hyacinths\r\nin early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool glens, and\r\ngrassy knolls; yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round the\r\ngnarled roots of the oak-trees; bright celandine, and blue speedwell, and\r\nirises lilac and gold.  There were grey catkins on the hazels, and the\r\nfoxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled bee-haunted cells.  The\r\nchestnut had its spires of white stars, and the hawthorn its pallid moons\r\nof beauty.  Yes: surely she would come if he could only find her!  She\r\nwould come with him to the fair forest, and all day long he would dance\r\nfor her delight.  A smile lit up his eyes at the thought, and he passed\r\ninto the next room.\r\n\r\nOf all the rooms this was the brightest and the most beautiful.  The\r\nwalls were covered with a pink-flowered Lucca damask, patterned with\r\nbirds and dotted with dainty blossoms of silver; the furniture was of\r\nmassive silver, festooned with florid wreaths, and swinging Cupids; in\r\nfront of the two large fire-places stood great screens broidered with\r\nparrots and peacocks, and the floor, which was of sea-green onyx, seemed\r\nto stretch far away into the distance.  Nor was he alone.  Standing under\r\nthe shadow of the doorway, at the extreme end of the room, he saw a\r\nlittle figure watching him.  His heart trembled, a cry of joy broke from\r\nhis lips, and he moved out into the sunlight.  As he did so, the figure\r\nmoved out also, and he saw it plainly.--_The Birthday of the Infanta_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROTECTED COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n'The kings of each city levied tolls on us, but would not suffer us to\r\nenter their gates.  They threw us bread over the walls, little\r\nmaize-cakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled with dates.  For\r\nevery hundred baskets we gave them a bead of amber.\r\n\r\n'When the dwellers in the villages saw us coming, they poisoned the wells\r\nand fled to the hill-summits.  We fought with the Magadae who are born\r\nold, and grow younger and younger every year, and die when they are\r\nlittle children; and with the Laktroi who say that they are the sons of\r\ntigers, and paint themselves yellow and black; and with the Aurantes who\r\nbury their dead on the tops of trees, and themselves live in dark caverns\r\nlest the Sun, who is their god, should slay them; and with the Krimnians\r\nwho worship a crocodile, and give it earrings of green glass, and feed it\r\nwith butter and fresh fowls; and with the Agazonbae, who are dog-faced;\r\nand with the Sibans, who have horses' feet, and run more swiftly than\r\nhorses.  A third of our company died in battle, and a third died of want.\r\nThe rest murmured against me, and said that I had brought them an evil\r\nfortune.  I took a horned adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me.\r\nWhen they saw that I did not sicken they grew afraid.\r\n\r\n'In the fourth month we reached the city of Illel.  It was night-time\r\nwhen we came to the grove that is outside the walls, and the air was\r\nsultry, for the Moon was travelling in Scorpion.  We took the ripe\r\npomegranates from the trees, and brake them, and drank their sweet\r\njuices.  Then we lay down on our carpets, and waited for the dawn.\r\n\r\n'And at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city.  It was wrought\r\nout of red bronze, and carved with sea-dragons and dragons that have\r\nwings.  The guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our\r\nbusiness.  The interpreter of the caravan answered that we had come from\r\nthe island of Syria with much merchandise.  They took hostages, and told\r\nus that they would open the gate to us at noon, and bade us tarry till\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n'When it was noon they opened the gate, and as we entered in the people\r\ncame crowding out of the houses to look at us, and a crier went round the\r\ncity crying through a shell.  We stood in the market-place, and the\r\nnegroes uncorded the bales of figured cloths and opened the carved chests\r\nof sycamore.  And when they had ended their task, the merchants set forth\r\ntheir strange wares, the waxed linen from Egypt and the painted linen\r\nfrom the country of the Ethiops, the purple sponges from Tyre and the\r\nblue hangings from Sidon, the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of\r\nglass and the curious vessels of burnt clay.  From the roof of a house a\r\ncompany of women watched us.  One of them wore a mask of gilded leather.\r\n\r\n'And on the first day the priests came and bartered with us, and on the\r\nsecond day came the nobles, and on the third day came the craftsmen and\r\nthe slaves.  And this is their custom with all merchants as long as they\r\ntarry in the city.\r\n\r\n'And we tarried for a moon, and when the moon was waning, I wearied and\r\nwandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of\r\nits god.  The priests in their yellow robes moved silently through the\r\ngreen trees, and on a pavement of black marble stood the rose-red house\r\nin which the god had his dwelling.  Its doors were of powdered lacquer,\r\nand bulls and peacocks were wrought on them in raised and polished gold.\r\nThe tilted roof was of sea-green porcelain, and the jutting eaves were\r\nfestooned with little bells.  When the white doves flew past, they struck\r\nthe bells with their wings and made them tinkle.\r\n\r\n'In front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with veined onyx.\r\nI lay down beside it, and with my pale fingers I touched the broad\r\nleaves.  One of the priests came towards me and stood behind me.  He had\r\nsandals on his feet, one of soft serpent-skin and the other of birds'\r\nplumage.  On his head was a mitre of black felt decorated with silver\r\ncrescents.  Seven yellows were woven into his robe, and his frizzed hair\r\nwas stained with antimony.\r\n\r\n'After a little while he spake to me, and asked me my desire.\r\n\r\n'I told him that my desire was to see the god.'--_The Fisherman and His\r\nSoul_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACKMAILING OF THE EMPEROR\r\n\r\n\r\n'As soon as the man was dead the Emperor turned to me, and when he had\r\nwiped away the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin of purfled\r\nand purple silk, he said to me, \"Art thou a prophet, that I may not harm\r\nthee, or the son of a prophet, that I can do thee no hurt?  I pray thee\r\nleave my city to-night, for while thou art in it I am no longer its\r\nlord.\"\r\n\r\n'And I answered him, \"I will go for half of thy treasure.  Give me half\r\nof thy treasure, and I will go away.\"\r\n\r\n'He took me by the hand, and led me out into the garden.  When the\r\ncaptain of the guard saw me, he wondered.  When the eunuchs saw me, their\r\nknees shook and they fell upon the ground in fear.\r\n\r\n'There is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry,\r\nand a brass-sealed ceiling hung with lamps.  The Emperor touched one of\r\nthe walls and it opened, and we passed down a corridor that was lit with\r\nmany torches.  In niches upon each side stood great wine-jars filled to\r\nthe brim with silver pieces.  When we reached the centre of the corridor\r\nthe Emperor spake the word that may not be spoken, and a granite door\r\nswung back on a secret spring, and he put his hands before his face lest\r\nhis eyes should be dazzled.\r\n\r\n'Thou couldst not believe how marvellous a place it was.  There were huge\r\ntortoise-shells full of pearls, and hollowed moonstones of great size\r\npiled up with red rubies.  The gold was stored in coffers of elephant-\r\nhide, and the gold-dust in leather bottles.  There were opals and\r\nsapphires, the former in cups of crystal, and the latter in cups of jade.\r\nRound green emeralds were ranged in order upon thin plates of ivory, and\r\nin one corner were silk bags filled, some with turquoise-stones, and\r\nothers with beryls.  The ivory horns were heaped with purple amethysts,\r\nand the horns of brass with chalcedonies and sards.  The pillars, which\r\nwere of cedar, were hung with strings of yellow lynx-stones.  In the flat\r\noval shields there were carbuncles, both wine-coloured and coloured like\r\ngrass.  And yet I have told thee but a tithe of what was there.\r\n\r\n'And when the Emperor had taken away his hands from before his face he\r\nsaid to me: \"This is my house of treasure, and half that is in it is\r\nthine, even as I promised to thee.  And I will give thee camels and camel\r\ndrivers, and they shall do thy bidding and take thy share of the treasure\r\nto whatever part of the world thou desirest to go.  And the thing shall\r\nbe done to-night, for I would not that the Sun, who is my father, should\r\nsee that there is in my city a man whom I cannot slay.\"\r\n\r\n'But I answered him, \"The gold that is here is thine, and the silver also\r\nis thine, and thine are the precious jewels and the things of price.  As\r\nfor me, I have no need of these.  Nor shall I take aught from thee but\r\nthat little ring that thou wearest on the finger of thy hand.\"\r\n\r\n'And the Emperor frowned.  \"It is but a ring of lead,\" he cried, \"nor has\r\nit any value.  Therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my\r\ncity.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Nay,\" I answered, \"but I will take nought but that leaden ring, for I\r\nknow what is written within it, and for what purpose.\"\r\n\r\n'And the Emperor trembled, and besought me and said, \"Take all the\r\ntreasure and go from my city.  The half that is mine shall be thine\r\nalso.\"\r\n\r\n'And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a cave\r\nthat is but a day's journey from this place have, I hidden the Ring of\r\nRiches.  It is but a day's journey from this place, and it waits for thy\r\ncoming.  He who has this Ring is richer than all the kings of the world.\r\nCome therefore and take it, and the world's riches shall be thine.'--_The\r\nFisherman and His Soul_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOVENT GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere he went he hardly knew.  He had a dim memory of wandering through a\r\nlabyrinth of sordid houses, of being lost in a giant web of sombre\r\nstreets, and it was bright dawn when he found himself at last in\r\nPiccadilly Circus.  As he strolled home towards Belgrave Square, he met\r\nthe great waggons on their way to Covent Garden.  The white-smocked\r\ncarters, with their pleasant sunburnt faces and coarse curly hair, strode\r\nsturdily on, cracking their whips, and calling out now and then to each\r\nother; on the back of a huge grey horse, the leader of a jangling team,\r\nsat a chubby boy, with a bunch of primroses in his battered hat, keeping\r\ntight hold of the mane with his little hands, and laughing; and the great\r\npiles of vegetables looked like masses of jade against the morning sky,\r\nlike masses of green jade against the pink petals of some marvellous\r\nrose.  Lord Arthur felt curiously affected, he could not tell why.  There\r\nwas something in the dawn's delicate loveliness that seemed to him\r\ninexpressibly pathetic, and he thought of all the days that break in\r\nbeauty, and that set in storm.  These rustics, too, with their rough,\r\ngood-humoured voices, and their nonchalant ways, what a strange London\r\nthey saw!  A London free from the sin of night and the smoke of day, a\r\npallid, ghost-like city, a desolate town of tombs!  He wondered what they\r\nthought of it, and whether they knew anything of its splendour and its\r\nshame, of its fierce, fiery-coloured joys, and its horrible hunger, of\r\nall it makes and mars from morn to eve.  Probably it was to them merely a\r\nmart where they brought their fruits to sell, and where they tarried for\r\na few hours at most, leaving the streets still silent, the houses still\r\nasleep.  It gave him pleasure to watch them as they went by.  Rude as\r\nthey were, with their heavy, hob-nailed shoes, and their awkward gait,\r\nthey brought a little of a ready with them.  He felt that they had lived\r\nwith Nature, and that she had taught them peace.  He envied them all that\r\nthey did not know.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had reached Belgrave Square the sky was a faint blue, and\r\nthe birds were beginning to twitter in the gardens.--_Lord Arthur\r\nSavile's Crime_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER FROM MISS JANE PERCY TO HER AUNT\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEANERY, CHICHESTER,\r\n\r\n27_th May_.\r\n\r\nMy Dearest Aunt,\r\n\r\nThank you so much for the flannel for the Dorcas Society, and also for\r\nthe gingham.  I quite agree with you that it is nonsense their wanting to\r\nwear pretty things, but everybody is so Radical and irreligious nowadays,\r\nthat it is difficult to make them see that they should not try and dress\r\nlike the upper classes.  I am sure I don't know what we are coming to.  As\r\npapa has often said in his sermons, we live in an age of unbelief.\r\n\r\nWe have had great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papa last\r\nThursday.  It arrived in a wooden box from London, carriage paid, and\r\npapa feels it must have been sent by some one who had read his remarkable\r\nsermon, 'Is Licence Liberty?' for on the top of the clock was a figure of\r\na woman, with what papa said was the cap of Liberty on her head.  I\r\ndidn't think it very becoming myself, but papa said it was historical, so\r\nI suppose it is all right.  Parker unpacked it, and papa put it on the\r\nmantelpiece in the library, and we were all sitting there on Friday\r\nmorning, when just as the clock struck twelve, we heard a whirring noise,\r\na little puff of smoke came from the pedestal of the figure, and the\r\ngoddess of Liberty fell off, and broke her nose on the fender!  Maria was\r\nquite alarmed, but it looked so ridiculous, that James and I went off\r\ninto fits of laughter, and even papa was amused.  When we examined it, we\r\nfound it was a sort of alarum clock, and that, if you set it to a\r\nparticular hour, and put some gunpowder and a cap under a little hammer,\r\nit went off whenever you wanted.  Papa said it must not remain in the\r\nlibrary, as it made a noise, so Reggie carried it away to the schoolroom,\r\nand does nothing but have small explosions all day long.  Do you think\r\nArthur would like one for a wedding present?  I suppose they are quite\r\nfashionable in London.  Papa says they should do a great deal of good, as\r\nthey show that Liberty can't last, but must fall down.  Papa says Liberty\r\nwas invented at the time of the French Revolution.  How awful it seems!\r\n\r\nI have now to go to the Dorcas, where I will read them your most\r\ninstructive letter.  How true, dear aunt, your idea is, that in their\r\nrank of life they should wear what is unbecoming.  I must say it is\r\nabsurd, their anxiety about dress, when there are so many more important\r\nthings in this world, and in the next.  I am so glad your flowered poplin\r\nturned out so well, and that your lace was not torn.  I am wearing my\r\nyellow satin, that you so kindly gave me, at the Bishop's on Wednesday,\r\nand think it will look all right.  Would you have bows or not?  Jennings\r\nsays that every one wears bows now, and that the underskirt should be\r\nfrilled.  Reggie has just had another explosion, and papa has ordered the\r\nclock to be sent to the stables.  I don't think papa likes it so much as\r\nhe did at first, though he is very flattered at being sent such a pretty\r\nand ingenious toy.  It shows that people read his sermons, and profit by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPapa sends his love, in which James, and Reggie, and Maria all unite,\r\nand, hoping that Uncle Cecil's gout is better, believe me, dear aunt,\r\never your affectionate niece,\r\n\r\nJANE PERCY.\r\n\r\nPS.--Do tell me about the bows.  Jennings insists they are the\r\nfashion.--_Lord Arthur Savile's Crime_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF AMERICAN 'HUMOR'\r\n\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed.  For some time he was\r\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the light-\r\nhearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves before\r\nthey retired to rest, but at a quarter past eleven all was still, and, as\r\nmidnight sounded, he sallied forth.  The owl beat against the window\r\npanes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind wandered\r\nmoaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family slept\r\nunconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he could\r\nhear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States.  He\r\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\r\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\r\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his murdered\r\nwife were blazoned in azure and gold.  On and on he glided, like an evil\r\nshadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.  Once he\r\nthought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only the baying\r\nof a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange sixteenth-\r\ncentury curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger in the\r\nmidnight air.  Finally he reached the corner of the passage that led to\r\nluckless Washington's room.  For a moment he paused there, the wind\r\nblowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into grotesque\r\nand fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's shroud.  Then\r\nthe clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was come.  He chuckled\r\nto himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had he done so, than,\r\nwith a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid his blanched face in\r\nhis long, bony hands.  Right in front of him was standing a horrible\r\nspectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous as a madman's dream!\r\nIts head was bald and burnished; its face round, and fat, and white; and\r\nhideous laughter seemed to have writhed its features into an eternal\r\ngrin.  From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet light, the mouth was a wide\r\nwell of fire, and a hideous garment, like to his own, swathed with its\r\nsilent snows the Titan form.  On its breast was a placard with strange\r\nwriting in antique characters, some scroll of shame it seemed, some\r\nrecord of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime, and, with its right\r\nhand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\r\n\r\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\r\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\r\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\r\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's jack-\r\nboots, where it was found in the morning by the butler.  Once in the\r\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small pallet-\r\nbed, and hid his face under the clothes.  After a time, however, the\r\nbrave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to go and\r\nspeak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight.  Accordingly, just\r\nas the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards the\r\nspot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling that,\r\nafter all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid of his\r\nnew friend, he might safely grapple with the twins.  On reaching the\r\nspot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze.  Something had evidently\r\nhappened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from its hollow\r\neyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it was leaning\r\nup against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable attitude.  He rushed\r\nforward and seized it in his arms, when, to his horror, the head slipped\r\noff and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a recumbent posture, and he\r\nfound himself clasping a white dimity bed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush,\r\na kitchen cleaver, and a hollow turnip lying at his feet!--_The\r\nCanterville Ghost_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GARDEN OF DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\n'Far away beyond the pine-woods,' he answered, in a low dreamy voice,\r\n'there is a little garden.  There the grass grows long and deep, there\r\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\r\nsings all night long.  All night long he sings, and the cold, crystal\r\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\r\nsleepers.'\r\n\r\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n'You mean the Garden of Death,' she whispered.\r\n\r\n'Yes, Death.  Death must be so beautiful.  To lie in the soft brown\r\nearth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence.\r\nTo have no yesterday, and no to-morrow.  To forget time, to forgive life,\r\nto be at peace.  You can help me.  You can open for me the portals of\r\nDeath's house, for Love is always with you, and Love is stronger than\r\nDeath is.'\r\n\r\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\r\nthere was silence.  She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\r\n\r\nThen the Ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n'Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, often,' cried the little girl, looking up; 'I know it quite well.  It\r\nis painted in curious black letters, and it is difficult to read.  There\r\nare only six lines:\r\n\r\n   When a golden girl can win\r\n   Prayer from out the lips of sin,\r\n   When the barren almond bears,\r\n   And a little child gives away its tears,\r\n   Then shall all the house be still\r\n   And peace come to Canterville.\r\n\r\nBut I don't know what they mean.'\r\n\r\n'They mean,' he said sadly, 'that you must weep for me for my sins,\r\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\r\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle, the\r\nAngel of Death will have mercy on me.  You will see fearful shapes in\r\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\r\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\r\ncannot prevail.'\r\n\r\nVirginia made no answer, and the Ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as\r\nhe looked down at her bowed golden head.  Suddenly she stood up, very\r\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes.  'I am not afraid,' she said\r\nfirmly, 'and I will ask the Angel to have mercy on you.'\r\n\r\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\r\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it.  His fingers were as cold\r\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as he\r\nled her across the dusky room.  On the faded green tapestry were\r\nbroidered little huntsmen.  They blew their tasselled horns and with\r\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back.  'Go back! little Virginia,'\r\nthey cried, 'go back!' but the Ghost clutched her hand more tightly, and\r\nshe shut her eyes against them.  Horrible animals with lizard tails, and\r\ngoggle eyes, blinked at her from the carven chimney-piece, and murmured\r\n'Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,' but the\r\nGhost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen.  When they\r\nreached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she could\r\nnot understand.  She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly fading away\r\nlike a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her.  A bitter cold\r\nwind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her dress.\r\n'Quick, quick,' cried the Ghost, 'or it will be too late,' and, in a\r\nmoment, the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry Chamber\r\nwas empty.--_The Canterville Ghost_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ETON KIT-CAT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Erskine, lighting a cigarette, \"I must begin by telling you\r\nabout Cyril Graham himself.  He and I were at the same house at Eton.  I\r\nwas a year or two older than he was, but we were immense friends, and did\r\nall our work and all our play together.  There was, of course, a good\r\ndeal more play than work, but I cannot say that I am sorry for that.  It\r\nis always an advantage not to have received a sound commercial education,\r\nand what I learned in the playing fields at Eton has been quite as useful\r\nto me as anything I was taught at Cambridge.  I should tell you that\r\nCyril's father and mother were both dead.  They had been drowned in a\r\nhorrible yachting accident off the Isle of Wight.  His father had been in\r\nthe diplomatic service, and had married a daughter, the only daughter, in\r\nfact, of old Lord Crediton, who became Cyril's guardian after the death\r\nof his parents.  I don't think that Lord Crediton cared very much for\r\nCyril.  He had never really forgiven his daughter for marrying a man who\r\nhad not a title.  He was an extraordinary old aristocrat, who swore like\r\na costermonger, and had the manners of a farmer.  I remember seeing him\r\nonce on Speech-day.  He growled at me, gave me a sovereign, and told me\r\nnot to grow up 'a damned Radical' like my father.  Cyril had very little\r\naffection for him, and was only too glad to spend most of his holidays\r\nwith us in Scotland.  They never really got on together at all.  Cyril\r\nthought him a bear, and he thought Cyril effeminate.  He was effeminate,\r\nI suppose, in some things, though he was a very good rider and a capital\r\nfencer.  In fact he got the foils before he left Eton.  But he was very\r\nlanguid in his manner, and not a little vain of his good looks, and had a\r\nstrong objection to football.  The two things that really gave him\r\npleasure were poetry and acting.  At Eton he was always dressing up and\r\nreciting Shakespeare, and when he went up to Trinity he became a member\r\nof the A.D.C. his first term.  I remember I was always very jealous of\r\nhis acting.  I was absurdly devoted to him; I suppose because we were so\r\ndifferent in some things.  I was a rather awkward, weakly lad, with huge\r\nfeet, and horribly freckled.  Freckles run in Scotch families just as\r\ngout does in English families.  Cyril used to say that of the two he\r\npreferred the gout; but he always set an absurdly high value on personal\r\nappearance, and once read a paper before our debating society to prove\r\nthat it was better to be good-looking than to be good.  He certainly was\r\nwonderfully handsome.  People who did not like him, Philistines and\r\ncollege tutors, and young men reading for the Church, used to say that he\r\nwas merely pretty; but there was a great deal more in his face than mere\r\nprettiness.  I think he was the most splendid creature I ever saw, and\r\nnothing could exceed the grace of his movements, the charm of his manner.\r\nHe fascinated everybody who was worth fascinating, and a great many\r\npeople who were not.  He was often wilful and petulant, and I used to\r\nthink him dreadfully insincere.  It was due, I think, chiefly to his\r\ninordinate desire to please.  Poor Cyril!  I told him once that he was\r\ncontented with very cheap triumphs, but he only laughed.  He was horribly\r\nspoiled.  All charming people, I fancy, are spoiled.  It is the secret of\r\ntheir attraction.\r\n\r\n\"However, I must tell you about Cyril's acting.  You know that no\r\nactresses are allowed to play at the A.D.C.  At least they were not in my\r\ntime.  I don't know how it is now.  Well, of course, Cyril was always\r\ncast for the girls' parts, and when _As You Like It_ was produced he\r\nplayed Rosalind.  It was a marvellous performance.  In fact, Cyril Graham\r\nwas the only perfect Rosalind I have ever seen.  It would be impossible\r\nto describe to you the beauty, the delicacy, the refinement of the whole\r\nthing.  It made an immense sensation, and the horrid little theatre, as\r\nit was then, was crowded every night.  Even when I read the play now I\r\ncan't help thinking of Cyril.  It might have been written for him.  The\r\nnext term he took his degree, and came to London to read for the\r\ndiplomatic.  But he never did any work.  He spent his days in reading\r\nShakespeare's Sonnets, and his evenings at the theatre.  He was, of\r\ncourse, wild to go on the stage.  It was all that I and Lord Crediton\r\ncould do to prevent him.  Perhaps if he had gone on the stage he would be\r\nalive now.  It is always a silly thing to give advice, but to give good\r\nadvice is absolutely fatal.  I hope you will never fall into that error.\r\nIf you do, you will be sorry for it.\"--_The Portrait of Mr. W. H_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. ERLYNNE EXERCISES THE PREROGATIVE OF A GRANDMOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Windermere, before Heaven your husband is guiltless of all offence\r\ntowards you!  And I--I tell you that had it ever occurred to me that such\r\na monstrous suspicion would have entered your mind, I would have died\r\nrather than have crossed your life or his--oh! died, gladly died!  Believe\r\nwhat you choose about me.  I am not worth a moment's sorrow.  But don't\r\nspoil your beautiful young life on my account!  You don't know what may\r\nbe in store for you, unless you leave this house at once.  You don't know\r\nwhat it is to fall into the pit, to be despised, mocked, abandoned,\r\nsneered at--to be an outcast! to find the door shut against one, to have\r\nto creep in by hideous byways, afraid every moment lest the mask should\r\nbe stripped from one's face, and all the while to hear the laughter, the\r\nhorrible laughter of the world, a thing more tragic than all the tears\r\nthe world has ever shed.  You don't know what it is.  One pays for one's\r\nsin, and then one pays again, and all one's life one pays.  You must\r\nnever know that.--As for me, if suffering be an expiation, then at this\r\nmoment I have expiated all my faults, whatever they have been; for to-\r\nnight you have made a heart in one who had it not, made it and broken\r\nit.--But let that pass.  I may have wrecked my own life, but I will not\r\nlet you wreck yours.  You--why, you are a mere girl, you would be lost.\r\nYou haven't got the kind of brains that enables a woman to get back.  You\r\nhave neither the wit nor the courage.  You couldn't stand dishonour!  No!\r\nGo back, Lady Windermere, to the husband who loves you, whom you love.\r\nYou have a child, Lady Windermere.  Go back to that child who even now,\r\nin pain or in joy, may be calling to you.  God gave you that child.  He\r\nwill require from you that you make his life fine, that you watch over\r\nhim.  What answer will you make to God if his life is ruined through you?\r\nBack to your house, Lady Windermere--your husband loves you!  He has\r\nnever swerved for a moment from the love he bears you.  But even if he\r\nhad a thousand loves, you must stay with your child.  If he was harsh to\r\nyou, you must stay with your child.  If he ill-treated you, you must stay\r\nwith your child.  If he abandoned you, your place is with your\r\nchild.--_Lady Windermere's Fan_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTHERHOOD MORE THAN MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nMen don't understand what mothers are.  I am no different from other\r\nwomen except in the wrong done me and the wrong I did, and my very heavy\r\npunishments and great disgrace.  And yet, to bear you I had to look on\r\ndeath.  To nurture you I had to wrestle with it.  Death fought with me\r\nfor you.  All women have to fight with death to keep their children.\r\nDeath, being childless, wants our children from us.  Gerald, when you\r\nwere naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave you food.  Night\r\nand day all that long winter I tended you.  No office is too mean, no\r\ncare too lowly for the thing we women love--and oh! how _I_ loved _you_.\r\nNot Hannah, Samuel more.  And you needed love, for you were weakly, and\r\nonly love could have kept you alive.  Only love can keep any one alive.\r\nAnd boys are careless often and without thinking give pain, and we always\r\nfancy that when they come to man's estate and know us better they will\r\nrepay us.  But it is not so.  The world draws them from our side, and\r\nthey make friends with whom they are happier than they are with us, and\r\nhave amusements from which we are barred, and interests that are not\r\nours: and they are unjust to us often, for when they find life bitter\r\nthey blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste its\r\nsweetness with them . . . You made many friends and went into their\r\nhouses and were glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to\r\nfollow, but stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat\r\nin darkness.  What should I have done in honest households?  My past was\r\never with me. . . . And you thought I didn't care for the pleasant things\r\nof life.  I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them,\r\nfeeling I had no right.  You thought I was happier working amongst the\r\npoor.  That was my mission, you imagined.  It was not, but where else was\r\nI to go?  The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is\r\npure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the\r\nkiss of sin.  It was you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the\r\nlove you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . .\r\nAnd you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and in\r\nChurch duties.  But where else could I turn?  God's house is the only\r\nhouse where sinners are made welcome, and you were always in my heart,\r\nGerald, too much in my heart.  For, though day after day, at morn or\r\nevensong, I have knelt in God's house, I have never repented of my sin.\r\nHow could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit!  Even now\r\nthat you are bitter to me I cannot repent.  I do not.  You are more to me\r\nthan innocence.  I would rather be your mother--oh! much rather!--than\r\nhave been always pure . . . Oh, don't you see? don't you understand?  It\r\nis my dishonour that has made you so dear to me.  It is my disgrace that\r\nhas bound you so closely to me.  It is the price I paid for you--the\r\nprice of soul and body--that makes me love you as I do.  Oh, don't ask me\r\nto do this horrible thing.  Child of my shame, be still the child of my\r\nshame!--_A Woman of No Importance_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAMNABLE IDEAL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy can't you women love us, faults and all?  Why do you place us on\r\nmonstrous pedestals?  We have all feet of clay, women as well as men; but\r\nwhen we men love women, we love them knowing their weaknesses, their\r\nfollies, their imperfections, love them all the more, it may be, for that\r\nreason.  It is not the perfect, but the imperfect, who have need of love.\r\nIt is when we are wounded by our own hands, or by the hands of others,\r\nthat love should come to cure us--else what use is love at all?  All\r\nsins, except a sin against itself, Love should forgive.  All lives, save\r\nloveless lives, true Love should pardon.  A man's love is like that.  It\r\nis wider, larger, more human than a woman's.  Women think that they are\r\nmaking ideals of men.  What they are making of us are false idols merely.\r\nYou made your false idol of me, and I had not the courage to come down,\r\nshow you my wounds, tell you my weaknesses.  I was afraid that I might\r\nlose your love, as I have lost it now.  And so, last night you ruined my\r\nlife for me--yes, ruined it!  What this woman asked of me was nothing\r\ncompared to what she offered to me.  She offered security, peace,\r\nstability.  The sin of my youth, that I had thought was buried, rose up\r\nin front of me, hideous, horrible, with its hands at my throat.  I could\r\nhave killed it for ever, sent it back into its tomb, destroyed its\r\nrecord, burned the one witness against me.  You prevented me.  No one but\r\nyou, you know it.  And now what is there before me but public disgrace,\r\nruin, terrible shame, the mockery of the world, a lonely dishonoured\r\nlife, a lonely dishonoured death, it may be, some day?  Let women make no\r\nmore ideals of men! let them not put them on alters and bow before them,\r\nor they may ruin other lives as completely as you--you whom I have so\r\nwildly loved--have ruined mine!--_An Ideal Husband_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM A REJECTED PRIZE-ESSAY\r\n\r\n\r\nNations may not have missions but they certainly have functions.  And the\r\nfunction of ancient Italy was not merely to give us what is statical in\r\nour institutions and rational in our law, but to blend into one elemental\r\ncreed the spiritual aspirations of Aryan and of Semite.  Italy was not a\r\npioneer in intellectual progress, nor a motive power in the evolution of\r\nthought.  The owl of the goddess of Wisdom traversed over the whole land\r\nand found nowhere a resting-place.  The dove, which is the bird of\r\nChrist, flew straight to the city of Rome and the new reign began.  It\r\nwas the fashion of early Italian painters to represent in mediaeval\r\ncostume the soldiers who watched over the tomb of Christ, and this, which\r\nwas the result of the frank anachronism of all true art, may serve to us\r\nas an allegory.  For it was in vain that the Middle Ages strove to guard\r\nthe buried spirit of progress.  When the dawn of the Greek spirit arose,\r\nthe sepulchre was empty, the grave-clothes laid aside.  Humanity had\r\nrisen from the dead.\r\n\r\nThe study of Greek, it has been well said, implies the birth of\r\ncriticism, comparison and research.  At the opening of that education of\r\nmodern by ancient thought which we call the Renaissance, it was the words\r\nof Aristotle which sent Columbus sailing to the New World, while a\r\nfragment of Pythagorean astronomy set Copernicus thinking on that train\r\nof reasoning which has revolutionised the whole position of our planet in\r\nthe universe.  Then it was seen that the only meaning of progress is a\r\nreturn to Greek modes of thought.  The monkish hymns which obscured the\r\npages of Greek manuscripts were blotted out, the splendours of a new\r\nmethod were unfolded to the world, and out of the melancholy sea of\r\nmediaevalism rose the free spirit of man in all that splendour of glad\r\nadolescence, when the bodily powers seem quickened by a new vitality,\r\nwhen the eye sees more clearly than its wont and the mind apprehends what\r\nwas beforetime hidden from it.  To herald the opening of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, from the little Venetian printing press came forth all the great\r\nauthors of antiquity, each bearing on the title-page the words [Greek\r\ntext]; words which may serve to remind us with what wondrous prescience\r\nPolybius saw the world's fate when he foretold the material sovereignty\r\nof Roman institutions and exemplified in himself the intellectual empire\r\nof Greece.\r\n\r\nThe course of the study of the spirit of historical criticism has not\r\nbeen a profitless investigation into modes and forms of thought now\r\nantiquated and of no account.  The only spirit which is entirely removed\r\nfrom us is the mediaeval; the Greek spirit is essentially modern.  The\r\nintroduction of the comparative method of research which has forced\r\nhistory to disclose its secrets belongs in a measure to us.  Ours, too,\r\nis a more scientific knowledge of philology and the method of survival.\r\nNor did the ancients know anything of the doctrine of averages or of\r\ncrucial instances, both of which methods have proved of such importance\r\nin modern criticism, the one adding a most important proof of the\r\nstatical elements of history, and exemplifying the influences of all\r\nphysical surroundings on the life of man; the other, as in the single\r\ninstance of the Moulin Quignon skull, serving to create a whole new\r\nscience of prehistoric archaeology and to bring us back to a time when\r\nman was coeval with the stone age, the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros.\r\nBut, except these, we have added no new canon or method to the science of\r\nhistorical criticism.  Across the drear waste of a thousand years the\r\nGreek and the modern spirit join hands.\r\n\r\nIn the torch race which the Greek boys ran from the Cerameician field of\r\ndeath to the home of the goddess of Wisdom, not merely he who first\r\nreached the goal but he also who first started with the torch aflame\r\nreceived a prize.  In the Lampadephoria of civilisation and free thought\r\nlet us not forget to render due meed of honour to those who first lit\r\nthat sacred flame, the increasing splendour of which lights our footsteps\r\nto the far-off divine event of the attainment of perfect truth.--_The\r\nRise of Historical Criticism_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POSSIBILITIES OF THE USEFUL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of men in the world, two great creeds, two different\r\nforms of natures: men to whom the end of life is action, and men to whom\r\nthe end of life is thought.  As regards the latter, who seek for\r\nexperience itself and not for the fruits of experience, who must burn\r\nalways with one of the passions of this fiery-coloured world, who find\r\nlife interesting not for its secret but for its situations, for its\r\npulsations and not for its purpose; the passion for beauty engendered by\r\nthe decorative arts will be to them more satisfying than any political or\r\nreligious enthusiasm, any enthusiasm for humanity, any ecstasy or sorrow\r\nfor love.  For art comes to one professing primarily to give nothing but\r\nthe highest quality to one's moments, and for those moments' sake.  So\r\nfar for those to whom the end of life is thought.  As regards the others,\r\nwho hold that life is inseparable from labour, to them should this\r\nmovement be specially dear: for, if our days are barren without industry,\r\nindustry without art is barbarism.\r\n\r\nHewers of wood and drawers of water there must be always indeed among us.\r\nOur modern machinery has not much lightened the labour of man after all:\r\nbut at least let the pitcher that stands by the well be beautiful and\r\nsurely the labour of the day will be lightened: let the wood be made\r\nreceptive of some lovely form, some gracious design, and there will come\r\nno longer discontent but joy to the toiler.  For what is decoration but\r\nthe worker's expression of joy in his work?  And not joy merely--that is\r\na great thing yet not enough--but that opportunity of expressing his own\r\nindividuality which, as it is the essence of all life, is the source of\r\nall art.  'I have tried,' I remember William Morris saying to me once, 'I\r\nhave tried to make each of my workers an artist, and when I say an artist\r\nI mean a man.'  For the worker then, handicraftsman of whatever kind he\r\nis, art is no longer to be a purple robe woven by a slave and thrown over\r\nthe whitened body of a leprous king to hide and to adorn the sin of his\r\nluxury, but rather the beautiful and noble expression of a life that has\r\nin it something beautiful and noble.--_The English Renaissance of Art_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARTIST\r\n\r\n\r\nONE evening there came into his soul the desire to fashion an image of\r\n_The Pleasure that abideth for a Moment_.  And he went forth into the\r\nworld to look for bronze.  For he could think only in bronze.\r\n\r\nBut all the bronze of the whole world had disappeared, nor anywhere in\r\nthe whole world was there any bronze to be found, save only the bronze of\r\nthe image of _The Sorrow that endureth for Ever_.\r\n\r\nNow this image he had himself, and with his own hands, fashioned, and had\r\nset it on the tomb of the one thing he had loved in life.  On the tomb of\r\nthe dead thing he had most loved had he set this image of his own\r\nfashioning, that it might serve as a sign of the love of man that dieth\r\nnot, and a symbol of the sorrow of man that endureth for ever.  And in\r\nthe whole world there was no other bronze save the bronze of this image.\r\n\r\nAnd he took the image he had fashioned, and set it in a great furnace,\r\nand gave it to the fire.\r\n\r\nAnd out of the bronze of the image of _The Sorrow that endureth for Ever_\r\nhe fashioned an image of _The Pleasure that abideth for a Moment_.--_Poems\r\nin Prose_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOER OF GOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was night-time and He was alone.\r\n\r\nAnd He saw afar-off the walls of a round city and went towards the city.\r\n\r\nAnd when He came near He heard within the city the tread of the feet of\r\njoy, and the laughter of the mouth of gladness and the loud noise of many\r\nlutes.  And He knocked at the gate and certain of the gate-keepers opened\r\nto Him.\r\n\r\nAnd He beheld a house that was of marble and had fair pillars of marble\r\nbefore it.  The pillars were hung with garlands, and within and without\r\nthere were torches of cedar.  And He entered the house.\r\n\r\nAnd when He had passed through the hall of chalcedony and the hall of\r\njasper, and reached the long hall of feasting, He saw lying on a couch of\r\nsea-purple one whose hair was crowned with red roses and whose lips were\r\nred with wine.\r\n\r\nAnd He went behind him and touched him on the shoulder and said to him,\r\n'Why do you live like this?'\r\n\r\nAnd the young man turned round and recognised Him, and made answer and\r\nsaid, 'But I was a leper once, and you healed me.  How else should I\r\nlive?'\r\n\r\nAnd He passed out of the house and went again into the street.\r\n\r\nAnd after a little while He saw one whose face and raiment were painted\r\nand whose feet were shod with pearls.  And behind her came, slowly as a\r\nhunter, a young man who wore a cloak of two colours.  Now the face of the\r\nwoman was as the fair face of an idol, and the eyes of the young man were\r\nbright with lust.\r\n\r\nAnd He followed swiftly and touched the hand of the young man and said to\r\nhim, 'Why do you look at this woman and in such wise?'\r\n\r\nAnd the young man turned round and recognised Him and said, 'But I was\r\nblind once, and you gave me sight.  At what else should I look?'\r\n\r\nAnd He ran forward and touched the painted raiment of the woman and said\r\nto her, 'Is there no other way in which to walk save the way of sin?'\r\n\r\nAnd the woman turned round and recognised Him, and laughed and said, 'But\r\nyou forgave me my sins, and the way is a pleasant way.'\r\n\r\nAnd He passed out of the city.\r\n\r\nAnd when He had passed out of the city He saw seated by the roadside a\r\nyoung man who was weeping.\r\n\r\nAnd He went towards him and touched the long locks of his hair and said\r\nto him, 'Why are you weeping?'\r\n\r\nAnd the young man looked up and recognised Him and made answer, 'But I\r\nwas dead once, and you raised me from the dead.  What else should I do\r\nbut weep?'--_Poems in Prose_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISCIPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Narcissus died the pool of his pleasure changed from a cup of sweet\r\nwaters into a cup of salt tears, and the Oreads came weeping through the\r\nwoodland that they might sing to the pool and give it comfort.\r\n\r\nAnd when they saw that the pool had changed from a cup of sweet waters\r\ninto a cup of salt tears, they loosened the green tresses of their hair\r\nand cried to the pool and said, 'We do not wonder that you should mourn\r\nin this manner for Narcissus, so beautiful was he.'\r\n\r\n'But was Narcissus beautiful?' said the pool.\r\n\r\n'Who should know that better than you?' answered the Oreads.  'Us did he\r\never pass by, but you he sought for, and would lie on your banks and look\r\ndown at you, and in the mirror of your waters he would mirror his own\r\nbeauty.'\r\n\r\nAnd the pool answered, 'But I loved Narcissus because, as he lay on my\r\nbanks and looked down at me, in the mirror of his eyes I saw ever my own\r\nbeauty mirrored.'--_Poems in Prose_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MASTER\r\n\r\n\r\nNow when the darkness came over the earth Joseph of Arimathea, having\r\nlighted a torch of pinewood, passed down from the hill into the valley.\r\nFor he had business in his own home.\r\n\r\nAnd kneeling on the flint stones of the Valley of Desolation he saw a\r\nyoung man who was naked and weeping.  His hair was the colour of honey,\r\nand his body was as a white flower, but he had wounded his body with\r\nthorns and on his hair had he set ashes as a crown.\r\n\r\nAnd he who had great possessions said to the young man who was naked and\r\nweeping, 'I do not wonder that your sorrow is so great, for surely He was\r\na just man.'\r\n\r\nAnd the young man answered, 'It is not for Him that I am weeping, but for\r\nmyself.  I too have changed water into wine, and I have healed the leper\r\nand given sight to the blind.  I have walked upon the waters, and from\r\nthe dwellers in the tombs I have cast out devils.  I have fed the hungry\r\nin the desert where there was no food, and I have raised the dead from\r\ntheir narrow houses, and at my bidding, and before a great multitude, of\r\npeople, a barren fig-tree withered away.  All things that this man has\r\ndone I have done also.  And yet they have not crucified me.'--_Poems in\r\nProse_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF JUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there was silence in the House of Judgment, and the Man came naked\r\nbefore God.\r\n\r\nAnd God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.\r\n\r\nAnd God said to the Man, 'Thy life hath been evil, and thou hast shown\r\ncruelty to those who were in need of succour, and to those who lacked\r\nhelp thou hast been bitter and hard of heart.  The poor called to thee\r\nand thou didst not hearken, and thine ears were closed to the cry of My\r\nafflicted.  The inheritance of the fatherless thou didst take unto\r\nthyself, and thou didst send the foxes into the vineyard of thy\r\nneighbour's field.  Thou didst take the bread of the children and give it\r\nto the dogs to eat, and My lepers who lived in the marshes, and were at\r\npeace and praised Me, thou didst drive forth on to the highways, and on\r\nMine earth out of which I made thee thou didst spill innocent blood.'\r\n\r\nAnd the Man made answer and said, 'Even so did I.'\r\n\r\nAnd again God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.\r\n\r\nAnd God said to the Man, 'Thy life hath been evil, and the Beauty I have\r\nshown thou hast sought for, and the Good I have hidden thou didst pass\r\nby.  The walls of thy chamber were painted with images, and from the bed\r\nof thine abominations thou didst rise up to the sound of flutes.  Thou\r\ndidst build seven altars to the sins I have suffered, and didst eat of\r\nthe thing that may not be eaten, and the purple of thy raiment was\r\nbroidered with the three signs of shame.  Thine idols were neither of\r\ngold nor of silver that endure, but of flesh that dieth.  Thou didst\r\nstain their hair with perfumes and put pomegranates in their hands.  Thou\r\ndidst stain their feet with saffron and spread carpets before them.  With\r\nantimony thou didst stain their eyelids and their bodies thou didst smear\r\nwith myrrh.  Thou didst bow thyself to the ground before them, and the\r\nthrones of thine idols were set in the sun.  Thou didst show to the sun\r\nthy shame and to the moon thy madness.'\r\n\r\nAnd the Man made answer and said, 'Even so did I.'\r\n\r\nAnd a third time God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.\r\n\r\nAnd God said to the Man, 'Evil hath been thy life, and with evil didst\r\nthou requite good, and with wrongdoing kindness.  The hands that fed thee\r\nthou didst wound, and the breasts that gave thee suck thou didst despise.\r\nHe who came to thee with water went away thirsting, and the outlawed men\r\nwho hid thee in their tents at night thou didst betray before dawn.  Thine\r\nenemy who spared thee thou didst snare in an ambush, and the friend who\r\nwalked with thee thou didst sell for a price, and to those who brought\r\nthee Love thou didst ever give Lust in thy turn.'\r\n\r\nAnd the Man made answer and said, 'Even so did I.'\r\n\r\nAnd God closed the Book of the Life of the Man, and said, 'Surely I will\r\nsend thee into Hell.  Even into Hell will I send thee.'\r\n\r\nAnd the Man cried out, 'Thou canst not.'\r\n\r\nAnd God said to the Man, 'Wherefore can I not send thee to Hell, and for\r\nwhat reason?'\r\n\r\n'Because in Hell have I always lived,' answered the Man.\r\n\r\nAnd there was silence in the House of Judgment.\r\n\r\nAnd after a space God spake, and said to the Man, 'Seeing that I may not\r\nsend thee into Hell, surely I will send thee unto Heaven.  Even unto\r\nHeaven will I send thee.'\r\n\r\nAnd the Man cried out, 'Thou canst not.'\r\n\r\nAnd God said to the Man, 'Wherefore can I not send thee unto Heaven, and\r\nfor what reason?'\r\n\r\n'Because never, and in no place, have I been able to imagine it,'\r\nanswered the Man.\r\n\r\nAnd there was silence in the House of Judgment.--_Poems in Prose_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEACHER OF WISDOM\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom his childhood he had been as one filled with the perfect knowledge\r\nof God, and even while he was yet but a lad many of the saints, as well\r\nas certain holy women who dwelt in the free city of his birth, had been\r\nstirred to much wonder by the grave wisdom of his answers.\r\n\r\nAnd when his parents had given him the robe and the ring of manhood he\r\nkissed them, and left them and went out into the world, that he might\r\nspeak to the world about God.  For there were at that time many in the\r\nworld who either knew not God at all, or had but an incomplete knowledge\r\nof Him, or worshipped the false gods who dwell in groves and have no care\r\nof their worshippers.\r\n\r\nAnd he set his face to the sun and journeyed, walking without sandals, as\r\nhe had seen the saints walk, and carrying at his girdle a leathern wallet\r\nand a little water-bottle of burnt clay.\r\n\r\nAnd as he walked along the highway he was full of the joy that comes from\r\nthe perfect knowledge of God, and he sang praises unto God without\r\nceasing; and after a time he reached a strange land in which there were\r\nmany cities.\r\n\r\nAnd he passed through eleven cities.  And some of these cities were in\r\nvalleys, and others were by the banks of great rivers, and others were\r\nset on hills.  And in each city he found a disciple who loved him and\r\nfollowed him, and a great multitude also of people followed him from each\r\ncity, and the knowledge of God spread in the whole land, and many of the\r\nrulers were converted, and the priests of the temples in which there were\r\nidols found that half of their gain was gone, and when they beat upon\r\ntheir drums at noon none, or but a few, came with peacocks and with\r\nofferings of flesh as had been the custom of the land before his coming.\r\n\r\nYet the more the people followed him, and the greater the number of his\r\ndisciples, the greater became his sorrow.  And he knew not why his sorrow\r\nwas so great.  For he spake ever about God, and out of the fulness of\r\nthat perfect knowledge of God which God had Himself given to him.\r\n\r\nAnd one evening he passed out of the eleventh city, which was a city of\r\nArmenia, and his disciples and a great crowd of people followed after\r\nhim; and he went up on to a mountain and sat down on a rock that was on\r\nthe mountain, and his disciples stood round him, and the multitude knelt\r\nin the valley.\r\n\r\nAnd he bowed his head on his hands and wept, and said to his Soul, 'Why\r\nis it that I am full of sorrow and fear, and that each of my disciples is\r\nan enemy that walks in the noonday?'  And his Soul answered him and said,\r\n'God filled thee with the perfect knowledge of Himself, and thou hast\r\ngiven this knowledge away to others.  The pearl of great price thou hast\r\ndivided, and the vesture without seam thou hast parted asunder.  He who\r\ngiveth away wisdom robbeth himself.  He is as one who giveth his treasure\r\nto a robber.  Is not God wiser than thou art?  Who art thou to give away\r\nthe secret that God hath told thee?  I was rich once, and thou hast made\r\nme poor.  Once I saw God, and now thou hast hidden Him from me.'\r\n\r\nAnd he wept again, for he knew that his Soul spake truth to him, and that\r\nhe had given to others the perfect knowledge of God, and that he was as\r\none clinging to the skirts of God, and that his faith was leaving him by\r\nreason of the number of those who believed in him.\r\n\r\nAnd he said to himself, 'I will talk no more about God.  He who giveth\r\naway wisdom robbeth himself.'\r\n\r\nAnd after the space of some hours his disciples came near him and bowed\r\nthemselves to the ground and said, 'Master, talk to us about God, for\r\nthou hast the perfect knowledge of God, and no man save thee hath this\r\nknowledge.'\r\n\r\nAnd he answered them and said, 'I will talk to you about all other things\r\nthat are in heaven and on earth, but about God I will not talk to you.\r\nNeither now, nor at any time, will I talk to you about God.'\r\n\r\nAnd they were wroth with him and said to him, 'Thou hast led us into the\r\ndesert that we might hearken to thee.  Wilt thou send us away hungry, and\r\nthe great multitude that thou hast made to follow thee?'\r\n\r\nAnd he answered them and said, 'I will not talk to you about God.'\r\n\r\nAnd the multitude murmured against him and said to him, 'Thou hast led us\r\ninto the desert, and hast given us no food to eat.  Talk to us about God\r\nand it will suffice us.'\r\n\r\nBut he answered them not a word.  For he knew that if he spake to them\r\nabout God he would give away his treasure.\r\n\r\nAnd his disciples went away sadly, and the multitude of people returned\r\nto their own homes.  And many died on the way.\r\n\r\nAnd when he was alone he rose up and set his face to the moon, and\r\njourneyed for seven moons, speaking to no man nor making any answer.  And\r\nwhen the seventh moon had waned he reached that desert which is the\r\ndesert of the Great River.  And having found a cavern in which a Centaur\r\nhad once dwelt, he took it for his place of dwelling, and made himself a\r\nmat of reeds on which to lie, and became a hermit.  And every hour the\r\nHermit praised God that He had suffered him to keep some knowledge of Him\r\nand of His wonderful greatness.\r\n\r\nNow, one evening, as the Hermit was seated before the cavern in which he\r\nhad made his place of dwelling, he beheld a young man of evil and\r\nbeautiful face who passed by in mean apparel and with empty hands.  Every\r\nevening with empty hands the young man passed by, and every morning he\r\nreturned with his hands full of purple and pearls.  For he was a Robber\r\nand robbed the caravans of the merchants.\r\n\r\nAnd the Hermit looked at him and pitied him.  But he spake not a word.\r\nFor he knew that he who speaks a word loses his faith.\r\n\r\nAnd one morning, as the young man returned with his hands full of purple\r\nand pearls, he stopped and frowned and stamped his foot upon the sand,\r\nand said to the Hermit: 'Why do you look at me ever in this manner as I\r\npass by?  What is it that I see in your eyes?  For no man has looked at\r\nme before in this manner.  And the thing is a thorn and a trouble to me.'\r\n\r\nAnd the Hermit answered him and said, 'What you see in my eyes is pity.\r\nPity is what looks out at you from my eyes.'\r\n\r\nAnd the young man laughed with scorn, and cried to the Hermit in a bitter\r\nvoice, and said to him, 'I have purple and pearls in my hands, and you\r\nhave but a mat of reeds on which to lie.  What pity should you have for\r\nme?  And for what reason have you this pity?'\r\n\r\n'I have pity for you,' said the Hermit, 'because you have no knowledge of\r\nGod.'\r\n\r\n'Is this knowledge of God a precious thing?' asked the young man, and he\r\ncame close to the mouth of the cavern.\r\n\r\n'It is more precious than all the purple and the pearls of the world,'\r\nanswered the Hermit.\r\n\r\n'And have you got it?' said the young Robber, and he came closer still.\r\n\r\n'Once, indeed,' answered the Hermit, 'I possessed the perfect knowledge\r\nof God.  But in my foolishness I parted with it, and divided it amongst\r\nothers.  Yet even now is such knowledge as remains to me more precious\r\nthan purple or pearls.'\r\n\r\nAnd when the young Robber heard this he threw away the purple and the\r\npearls that he was bearing in his hands, and drawing a sharp sword of\r\ncurved steel he said to the Hermit, 'Give me, forthwith this knowledge of\r\nGod that you possess, or I will surely slay you.  Wherefore should I not\r\nslay him who has a treasure greater than my treasure?'\r\n\r\nAnd the Hermit spread out his arms and said, 'Were it not better for me\r\nto go unto the uttermost courts of God and praise Him, than to live in\r\nthe world and have no knowledge of Him?  Slay me if that be your desire.\r\nBut I will not give away my knowledge of God.'\r\n\r\nAnd the young Robber knelt down and besought him, but the Hermit would\r\nnot talk to him about God, nor give him his Treasure, and the young\r\nRobber rose up and said to the Hermit, 'Be it as you will.  As for\r\nmyself, I will go to the City of the Seven Sins, that is but three days'\r\njourney from this place, and for my purple they will give me pleasure,\r\nand for my pearls they will sell me joy.'  And he took up the purple and\r\nthe pearls and went swiftly away.\r\n\r\nAnd the Hermit cried out and followed him and besought him.  For the\r\nspace of three days he followed the young Robber on the road and\r\nentreated him to return, nor to enter into the City of the Seven Sins.\r\n\r\nAnd ever and anon the young Robber looked back at the Hermit and called\r\nto him, and said, 'Will you give me this knowledge of God which is more\r\nprecious than purple and pearls?  If you will give me that, I will not\r\nenter the city.'\r\n\r\nAnd ever did the Hermit answer, 'All things that I have I will give thee,\r\nsave that one thing only.  For that thing it is not lawful for me to give\r\naway.'\r\n\r\nAnd in the twilight of the third day they came nigh to the great scarlet\r\ngates of the City of the Seven Sins.  And from the city there came the\r\nsound of much laughter.\r\n\r\nAnd the young Robber laughed in answer, and sought to knock at the gate.\r\nAnd as he did so the Hermit ran forward and caught him by the skirts of\r\nhis raiment, and said to him: 'Stretch forth your hands, and set your\r\narms around my neck, and put your ear close to my lips, and I will give\r\nyou what remains to me of the knowledge of God.'  And the young Robber\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nAnd when the Hermit had given away his knowledge of God, he fell upon the\r\nground and wept, and a great darkness hid from him the city and the young\r\nRobber, so that he saw them no more.\r\n\r\nAnd as he lay there weeping he was ware of One who was standing beside\r\nhim; and He who was standing beside him had feet of brass and hair like\r\nfine wool.  And He raised the Hermit up, and said to him: 'Before this\r\ntime thou hadst the perfect knowledge of God.  Now thou shalt have the\r\nperfect love of God.  Wherefore art thou weeping?'  And he kissed\r\nhim.--_Poems in Prose_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILDE GIVES DIRECTIONS ABOUT 'DE PROFUNDIS'\r\n\r\n\r\nH.M. PRISON, READING.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 1897.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Robbie,--I send you a MS. separate from this, which I hope will\r\narrive safely.  As soon as you have read it, I want you to have it\r\ncarefully copied for me.  There are many causes why I wish this to be\r\ndone.  One will suffice.  I want you to be my literary executor in case\r\nof my death, and to have complete control of my plays, books, and papers.\r\nAs soon as I find I have a legal right to make a will, I will do so.  My\r\nwife does not understand my art, nor could be expected to have any\r\ninterest in it, and Cyril is only a child.  So I turn naturally to you,\r\nas indeed I do for everything, and would like you to have all my works.\r\nThe deficit that their sale will produce may be lodged to the credit of\r\nCyril and Vivian.  Well, if you are my literary executor, you must be in\r\npossession of the only document that gives any explanation of my\r\nextraordinary behaviour . . . When you have read the letter, you will see\r\nthe psychological explanation of a course of conduct that from the\r\noutside seems a combination of absolute idiotcy with vulgar bravado.  Some\r\nday the truth will have to be known--not necessarily in my lifetime . . .\r\nbut I am not prepared to sit in the grotesque pillory they put me into,\r\nfor all time; for the simple reason that I inherited from my father and\r\nmother a name of high distinction in literature and art, and I cannot for\r\neternity allow that name to be degraded.  I don't defend my conduct.  I\r\nexplain it.  Also there are in my letter certain passages which deal with\r\nmy mental development in prison, and the inevitable evolution of my\r\ncharacter and intellectual attitude towards life that has taken place:\r\nand I want you and others who still stand by me and have affection for me\r\nto know exactly in what mood and manner I hope to face the world.  Of\r\ncourse from one point of view I know that on the day of my release I\r\nshall be merely passing from one prison into another, and there are times\r\nwhen the whole world seems to me no larger than my cell and as full of\r\nterror for me.  Still I believe that at the beginning God made a world\r\nfor each separate man, and in that world which is within us we should\r\nseek to live.  At any rate you will read those parts of my letter with\r\nless pain than the others.  Of course I need not remind you how fluid a\r\nthing thought is with me--with us all--and of what an evanescent\r\nsubstance are our emotions made.  Still I do see a sort of possible goal\r\ntowards which, through art, I may progress.  It is not unlikely that you\r\nmay help me.\r\n\r\nAs regards the mode of copying: of course it is too long for any\r\namanuensis to attempt: and your own handwriting, dear Robbie, in your\r\nlast letter seems specially designed to remind me that the task is not to\r\nbe yours.  I think that the only thing to do is to be thoroughly modern\r\nand to have it typewritten.  Of course the MS. should not pass out of\r\nyour control, but could you not get Mrs. Marshall to send down one of her\r\ntype-writing girls--women are the most reliable as they have no memory\r\nfor the important--to Hornton Street or Phillimore Gardens, to do it\r\nunder your supervision?  I assure you that the typewriting machine, when\r\nplayed with expression, is not more annoying than the piano when played\r\nby a sister or near relation.  Indeed many among those most devoted to\r\ndomesticity prefer it.  I wish the copy to be done not on tissue paper\r\nbut on good paper such as is used for plays, and a wide rubricated margin\r\nshould be left for corrections . . . If the copy is done at Hornton\r\nStreet the lady typewriter might be fed through a lattice in the door,\r\nlike the Cardinals when they elect a Pope; till she comes out on the\r\nbalcony and can say to the world: \"Habet Mundus Epistolam\"; for indeed it\r\nis an Encyclical letter, and as the Bulls of the Holy Father are named\r\nfrom their opening words, it may be spoken of as the \"_Epistola_: _in\r\nCarcere et Vinculis_.\" . . . In point of fact, Robbie, prison life makes\r\none see people and things as they really are.  That is why it turns one\r\nto stone.  It is the people outside who are deceived by the illusions of\r\na life in constant motion.  They revolve with life and contribute to its\r\nunreality.  We who are immobile both see and know.  Whether or not the\r\nletter does good to narrow natures and hectic brains, to me it has done\r\ngood.  I have \"cleansed my bosom of much perilous stuff\"; to borrow a\r\nphrase from the poet whom you and I once thought of rescuing from the\r\nPhilistines.  I need not remind you that mere expression is to an artist\r\nthe supreme and only mode of life.  It is by utterance that we live.  Of\r\nthe many, many things for which I have to thank the Governor there is\r\nnone for which I am more grateful than for his permission to write fully\r\nand at as great a length as I desire.  For nearly two years I had within\r\na growing burden of bitterness, of much of which I have now got rid.  On\r\nthe other side of the prison wall there are some poor black\r\nsoot-besmirched trees that are just breaking out into buds of an almost\r\nshrill green.  I know quite well what they are going through.  They are\r\nfinding expression.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nOSCAR.\r\n\r\n--_Letter from Reading Prison to Robert Ross_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAREY STREET\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere there is sorrow there in holy ground.  Some day people will realise\r\nwhat that means.  They will know nothing of life till they do,--and\r\nnatures like his can realise it.  When I was brought down from my prison\r\nto the Court of Bankruptcy, between two policemen,--waited in the long\r\ndreary corridor that, before the whole crowd, whom an action so sweet and\r\nsimple hushed into silence, he might gravely raise his hat to me, as,\r\nhandcuffed and with bowed head, I passed him by.  Men have gone to heaven\r\nfor smaller things than that.  It was in this spirit, and with this mode\r\nof love, that the saints knelt down to wash the feet of the poor, or\r\nstooped to kiss the leper on the cheek.  I have never said one single\r\nword to him about what he did.  I do not know to the present moment\r\nwhether he is aware that I was even conscious of his action.  It is not a\r\nthing for which one can render formal thanks in formal words.  I store it\r\nin the treasure-house of my heart.  I keep it there as a secret debt that\r\nI am glad to think I can never possibly repay.  It is embalmed and kept\r\nsweet by the myrrh and cassia of many tears.  When wisdom has been\r\nprofitless to me, philosophy barren, and the proverbs and phrases of\r\nthose who have sought to give me consolation as dust and ashes in my\r\nmouth, the memory of that little, lovely, silent act of love has unsealed\r\nfor me all the wells of pity: made the desert blossom like a rose, and\r\nbrought me out of the bitterness of lonely exile into harmony with the\r\nwounded, broken, and great heart of the world.  When people are able to\r\nunderstand, not merely how beautiful ---'s action was, but why it meant\r\nso much to me, and always will mean so much, then, perhaps, they will\r\nrealise how and in what spirit they should approach me. . . .\r\n\r\nThe poor are wise, more charitable, more kind, more sensitive than we\r\nare.  In their eyes prison is a tragedy in a man's life, a misfortune, a\r\ncasuality, something that calls for sympathy in others.  They speak of\r\none who is in prison as of one who is 'in trouble' simply.  It is the\r\nphrase they always use, and the expression has the perfect wisdom of love\r\nin it.  With people of our own rank it is different.  With us, prison\r\nmakes a man a pariah.  I, and such as I am, have hardly any right to air\r\nand sun.  Our presence taints the pleasures of others.  We are unwelcome\r\nwhen we reappear.  To revisit the glimpses of the moon is not for us.  Our\r\nvery children are taken away.  Those lovely links with humanity are\r\nbroken.  We are doomed to be solitary, while our sons still live.  We are\r\ndenied the one thing that might heal us and keep us, that might bring\r\nbalm to the bruised heart, and peace to the soul in pain.--_De\r\nProfundis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSORROW WEARS NO MASK\r\n\r\n\r\nSorrow, being the supreme emotion of which man is capable, is at once the\r\ntype and test of all great art.  What the artist is always looking for is\r\nthe mode of existence in which soul and body are one and indivisible: in\r\nwhich the outward is expressive of the inward: in which form reveals.  Of\r\nsuch modes of existence there are not a few: youth and the arts\r\npreoccupied with youth may serve as a model for us at one moment: at\r\nanother we may like to think that, in its subtlety and sensitiveness of\r\nimpression, its suggestion of a spirit dwelling in external things and\r\nmaking its raiment of earth and air, of mist and city alike, and in its\r\nmorbid sympathy of its moods, and tones, and colours, modern landscape\r\nart is realising for us pictorially what was realised in such plastic\r\nperfection by the Greeks.  Music, in which all subject is absorbed in\r\nexpression and cannot be separated from it, is a complex example, and a\r\nflower or a child a simple example, of what I mean; but sorrow is the\r\nultimate type both in life and art.\r\n\r\nBehind joy and laughter there may be a temperament, coarse, hard and\r\ncallous.  But behind sorrow there is always sorrow.  Pain, unlike\r\npleasure, wears no mask.  Truth in art is not any correspondence between\r\nthe essential idea and the accidental existence; it is not the\r\nresemblance of shape to shadow, or of the form mirrored in the crystal to\r\nthe form itself; it is no echo coming from a hollow hill, any more than\r\nit is a silver well of water in the valley that shows the moon to the\r\nmoon and Narcissus to Narcissus.  Truth in art is the unity of a thing\r\nwith itself: the outward rendered expressive of the inward: the soul made\r\nincarnate: the body instinct with spirit.  For this reason there is no\r\ntruth comparable to sorrow.  There are times when sorrow seems to me to\r\nbe the only truth.  Other things may be illusions of the eye or the\r\nappetite, made to blind the one and cloy the other, but out of sorrow\r\nhave the worlds been built, and at the birth of a child or a star there\r\nis pain.\r\n\r\nMore than this, there is about sorrow an intense, an extraordinary\r\nreality.  I have said of myself that I was one who stood in symbolic\r\nrelations to the art and culture of my age.  There is not a single\r\nwretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in\r\nsymbolic relation to the very secret of life.  For the secret of life is\r\nsuffering.  It is what is hidden behind everything.  When we begin to\r\nlive, what is sweet is so sweet to us, and what is bitter so bitter, that\r\nwe inevitably direct all our desires towards pleasures, and seek not\r\nmerely for a 'month or twain to feed on honeycomb,' but for all our years\r\nto taste no other food, ignorant all the while that we may really be\r\nstarving the soul.--_De Profundis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVITA NUOVA\r\n\r\n\r\nFar off, like a perfect pearl, one can see the city of God.  It is so\r\nwonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summer's day.\r\nAnd so a child could.  But with me and such as me it is different.  One\r\ncan realise a thing in a single moment, but one loses it in the long\r\nhours that follow with leaden feet.  It is so difficult to keep 'heights\r\nthat the soul is competent to gain.'  We think in eternity, but we move\r\nslowly through time; and how slowly time goes with us who lie in prison I\r\nneed not tell again, nor of the weariness and despair that creep back\r\ninto one's cell, and into the cell of one's heart, with such strange\r\ninsistence that one has, as it were, to garnish and sweep one's house for\r\ntheir coming, as for an unwelcome guest, or a bitter master, or a slave\r\nwhose slave it is one's chance or choice to be.\r\n\r\nAnd, though at present my friends may find it a hard thing to believe, it\r\nis true none the less, that for them living in freedom and idleness and\r\ncomfort it is more easy to learn the lessons of humility than it is for\r\nme, who begin the day by going down on my knees and washing the floor of\r\nmy cell.  For prison life with its endless privations and restrictions\r\nmakes one rebellious.  The most terrible thing about it is not that it\r\nbreaks one's heart--hearts are made to be broken--but that it turns one's\r\nheart to stone.  One sometimes feels that it is only with a front of\r\nbrass and a lip of scorn that one can get through the day at all.  And he\r\nwho is in a state of rebellion cannot receive grace, to use the phrase of\r\nwhich the Church is so fond--so rightly fond, I dare say--for in life as\r\nin art the mood of rebellion closes up the channels of the soul, and\r\nshuts out the airs of heaven.  Yet I must learn these lessons here, if I\r\nam to learn them anywhere, and must be filled with joy if my feet are on\r\nthe right road and my face set towards 'the gate which is called\r\nbeautiful,' though I may fall many times in the mire and often in the\r\nmist go astray.\r\n\r\nThis New Life, as through my love of Dante I like sometimes to call it,\r\nis of course no new life at all, but simply the continuance, by means of\r\ndevelopment, and evolution, of my former life.  I remember when I was at\r\nOxford saying to one of my friends as we were strolling round Magdalen's\r\nnarrow bird-haunted walks one morning in the year before I took my\r\ndegree, that I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden\r\nof the world, and that I was going out into the world with that passion\r\nin my soul.  And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived.  My only mistake\r\nwas that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to\r\nme the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its\r\nshadow and its gloom.  Failure, disgrace, poverty, sorrow, despair,\r\nsuffering, tears even, the broken words that come from lips in pain,\r\nremorse that makes one walk on thorns, conscience that condemns, self-\r\nabasement that punishes, the misery that puts ashes on its head, the\r\nanguish that chooses sack-cloth for its raiment and into its own drink\r\nputs gall:--all these were things of which I was afraid.  And as I had\r\ndetermined to know nothing of them, I was forced to taste each of them in\r\nturn, to feed on them, to have for a season, indeed, no other food at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nI don't regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure.  I did it\r\nto the full, as one should do everything that one does.  There was no\r\npleasure I did not experience.  I threw the pearl of my soul into a cup\r\nof wine.  I went down the primrose path to the sound of flutes.  I lived\r\non honeycomb.  But to have continued the same life would have been wrong\r\nbecause it would have been limiting.  I had to pass on.  The other half\r\nof the garden had its secrets for me also.--_De Profundis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND ROMANTIC\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is when he deals with a sinner that Christ is most romantic, in the\r\nsense of most real.  The world had always loved the saint as being the\r\nnearest possible approach to the perfection of God.  Christ, through some\r\ndivine instinct in him, seems to have always loved the sinner as being\r\nthe nearest possible approach to the perfection of man.  His primary\r\ndesire was not to reform people, any more than his primary desire was to\r\na relieve suffering.  To turn an interesting thief into a tedious honest\r\nman was not his aim.  He would have thought little of the Prisoners' Aid\r\nSociety and other modern movements of the kind.  The conversion of a\r\npublican into a Pharisee would not have seemed to him a great\r\nachievement.  But in a manner not yet understood of the world he regarded\r\nsin and suffering as being in themselves beautiful holy things and modes\r\nof perfection.\r\n\r\nIt seems a very dangerous idea.  It is--all great ideas are dangerous.\r\nThat it was Christ's creed admits of no doubt.  That it is the true creed\r\nI don't doubt myself.\r\n\r\nOf course the sinner must repent.  But why?  Simply because otherwise he\r\nwould be unable to realise what he had done.  The moment of repentance is\r\nthe moment of initiation.  More than that: it is the means by which one\r\nalters one's past.  The Greeks thought that impossible.  They often say\r\nin their Gnomic aphorisms, 'Even the Gods cannot alter the past.'  Christ\r\nshowed that the commonest sinner could do it, that it was the one thing\r\nhe could do.  Christ, had he been asked, would have said--I feel quite\r\ncertain about it--that the moment the prodigal son fell on his knees and\r\nwept, he made his having wasted his substance with harlots, his swine-\r\nherding and hungering for the husks they ate, beautiful and holy moments\r\nin his life.  It is difficult for most people to grasp the idea.  I dare\r\nsay one has to go to prison to understand it.  If so, it may be worth\r\nwhile going to prison.\r\n\r\nThere is something so unique about Christ.  Of course just as there are\r\nfalse dawns before the dawn itself, and winter days so full of sudden\r\nsunlight that they will cheat the wise crocus into squandering its gold\r\nbefore its time, and make some foolish bird call to its mate to build on\r\nbarren boughs, so there were Christians before Christ.  For that we\r\nshould be grateful.  The unfortunate thing is that there have been none\r\nsince.  I make one exception, St. Francis of Assisi.  But then God had\r\ngiven him at his birth the soul of a poet, as he himself when quite young\r\nhad in mystical marriage taken poverty as his bride: and with the soul of\r\na poet and the body of a beggar he found the way to perfection not\r\ndifficult.  He understood Christ, and so he became like him.  We do not\r\nrequire the Liber Conformitatum to teach us that the life of St. Francis\r\nwas the true _Imitatio Christi_, a poem compared to which the book of\r\nthat name is merely prose.\r\n\r\nIndeed, that is the charm about Christ, when all is said: he is just like\r\na work of art.  He does not really teach one anything, but by being\r\nbrought into his presence one becomes something.  And everybody is\r\npredestined to his presence.  Once at least in his life each man walks\r\nwith Christ to Emmaus.--_De Profundis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAPHAM JUNCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nMy lot has been one of public infamy, of long imprisonment, of misery, of\r\nruin, of disgrace, but I am not worthy of it--not yet, at any rate.  I\r\nremember that I used to say that I thought I could bear a real tragedy if\r\nit came to me with purple pall and a mask of noble sorrow, but that the\r\ndreadful thing about modernity was that it put tragedy into the raiment\r\nof comedy, so that the great realities seemed commonplace or grotesque or\r\nlacking in style.  It is quite true about modernity.  It has probably\r\nalways been true about actual life.  It is said that all martyrdoms\r\nseemed mean to the looker on.  The nineteenth century is no exception to\r\nthe rule.\r\n\r\nEverything about my tragedy has been hideous, mean, repellent, lacking in\r\nstyle; our very dress makes us grotesque.  We are the zanies of sorrow.\r\nWe are clowns whose hearts are broken.  We are specially designed to\r\nappeal to the sense of humour.  On November 13th, 1895, I was brought\r\ndown here from London.  From two o'clock till half-past two on that day I\r\nhad to stand on the centre platform of Clapham Junction in convict dress,\r\nand handcuffed, for the world to look at.  I had been taken out of the\r\nhospital ward without a moment's notice being given to me.  Of all\r\npossible objects I was the most grotesque.  When people saw me they\r\nlaughed.  Each train as it came up swelled the audience.  Nothing could\r\nexceed their amusement.  That was, of course, before they knew who I was.\r\nAs soon as they had been informed they laughed still more.  For half an\r\nhour I stood there in the grey November rain surrounded by a jeering\r\nmob.--_De Profundis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROKEN RESOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe call ours a utilitarian age, and we do not know the uses of any single\r\nthing.  We have forgotten that water can cleanse, and fire purify, and\r\nthat the Earth is mother to us all.  As a consequence our art is of the\r\nmoon and plays with shadows, while Greek art is of the sun and deals\r\ndirectly with things.  I feel sure that in elemental forces there is\r\npurification, and I want to go back to them and live in their presence.\r\n\r\nOf course to one so modern as I am, 'Enfant de mon siecle,' merely to\r\nlook at the world will be always lovely.  I tremble with pleasure when I\r\nthink that on the very day of my leaving prison both the laburnum and the\r\nlilac will be blooming in the gardens, and that I shall see the wind stir\r\ninto restless beauty the swaying gold of the one, and make the other toss\r\nthe pale purple of its plumes, so that all the air shall be Arabia for\r\nme.  Linnaeus fell on his knees and wept for joy when he saw for the\r\nfirst time the long heath of some English upland made yellow with the\r\ntawny aromatic brooms of the common furze; and I know that for me, to\r\nwhom flowers are part of desire, there are tears waiting in the petals of\r\nsome rose.  It has always been so with me from my boyhood.  There is not\r\na single colour hidden away in the chalice of a flower, or the curve of a\r\nshell, to which, by some subtle sympathy with the very soul of things, my\r\nnature does not answer.  Like Gautier, I have always been one of those\r\n'pour qui le monde visible existe.'\r\n\r\nStill, I am conscious now that behind all this beauty, satisfying though\r\nit may be, there is some spirit hidden of which the painted forms and\r\nshapes are but modes of manifestation, and it is with this spirit that I\r\ndesire to become in harmony.  I have grown tired of the articulate\r\nutterances of men and things.  The Mystical in Art, the Mystical in Life,\r\nthe Mystical in Nature this is what I am looking for.  It is absolutely\r\nnecessary for me to find it somewhere.\r\n\r\nAll trials are trials for one's life, just as all sentences are sentences\r\nof death; and three times have I been tried.  The first time I left the\r\nbox to be arrested, the second time to be led back to the house of\r\ndetention, the third time to pass into a prison for two years.  Society,\r\nas we have constituted it, will have no place for me, has none to offer;\r\nbut Nature, whose sweet rains fall on unjust and just alike, will have\r\nclefts in the rocks where I may hide, and secret valleys in whose silence\r\nI may weep undisturbed.  She will hang the night with stars so that I may\r\nwalk abroad in the darkness without stumbling, and send the wind over my\r\nfootprints so that none may track me to my hurt: she will cleanse me in\r\ngreat waters, and with bitter herbs make me whole.--_De Profundis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTICITY AT BERNEVAL\r\n\r\n\r\nDIEPPE,\r\n\r\nJune 1st, 1897.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Robbie,--I propose to live at Berneval.  I will _not_ live in\r\nParis, nor in Algiers, nor in Southern Italy.  Surely a house for a year,\r\nif I choose to continue there, at 32 pounds is absurdly cheap.  I could\r\nnot live cheaper at a hotel.  You are penny foolish, and pound foolish--a\r\ndreadful state for my financier to be in.  I told M. Bonnet that my\r\nbankers were MM. Ross et Cie, banquiers celebres de Londres--and now you\r\nsuddenly show me that you have no place among the great financial people,\r\nand are afraid of any investment over 31 pounds, 10s.  It is merely the\r\nextra ten shillings that baffles you.  As regards people living on me,\r\nand the extra bedrooms: dear boy, there is no one who would stay with me\r\nbut you, and you will pay your own bill at the hotel for meals; and as\r\nfor your room, the charge will be nominally 2 francs 50 centimes a night,\r\nbut there will be lots of extras such as _bougie, bain_ and hot water,\r\nand all cigarettes smoked in the bedrooms are charged extra.  And if any\r\none does not take the extras, of course he is charged more:--\r\n\r\n   Bain, 25 C.\r\n\r\n   Pas de bain, 50 C.\r\n\r\n   Cigarette dans la chambre a coucher, 10 C. pour chaque cigarette.\r\n\r\n   Pas de cigarette dans la chambre a coucher, 20 C. pour chaque\r\n   cigarette.\r\n\r\nThis is the system at all good hotels.  If Reggie comes, of course he\r\nwill pay a little more: I cannot forget that he gave me a dressing-case.\r\nSphinxes pay a hundred per cent more than any one else--they always did\r\nin Ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nBut seriously, Robbie, if people stayed with me, of course they would pay\r\ntheir _pension_ at the hotel.  They would have to: except architects.  A\r\nmodern architect, like modern architecture, doesn't pay.  But then I know\r\nonly one architect and you are hiding him somewhere from me.  I believe\r\nthat he is as extinct as the dado, of which now only fossil remains are\r\nfound, chiefly in the vicinity of Brompton, where they are sometimes\r\ndiscovered by workmen excavating.  They are usually embedded in the old\r\nLincrusta Walton strata, and are rare consequently.\r\n\r\nI visited M. le Cure {4} to-day.  He has a charming house and a _jardin\r\npotager_.  He showed me over the church.  To-morrow I sit in the choir by\r\nhis special invitation.  He showed me all his vestments.  To-morrow he\r\nreally will be charming in red.  He knows I am a heretic, and believes\r\nPusey is still alive.  He says that God will convert England on account\r\nof England's kindness to _les pretres exiles_ at the time of the\r\nRevolution.  It is to be the reward of that sea-lashed island.\r\n\r\nStained glass windows are wanted in the church; he has only six; fourteen\r\nmore are needed.  He gets them at 300 francs--12 pounds--a window in\r\nParis.  I was nearly offering half a dozen, but remembered you, and so\r\nonly gave him something _pour les pauvres_.  You had a narrow escape,\r\nRobbie.  You should be thankful.\r\n\r\nI hope the 40 pounds is on its way, and that the 60 pounds will follow.  I\r\nam going to hire a boat.  It will save walking and so be an economy in\r\nthe end.  Dear Robbie, I must start well.  If the life of St. Francis of\r\nAssissi awaits me I shall not be angry.  Worse things might happen.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nOSCAR.\r\n\r\n--_Letter to Robert Ross_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO THE POPE\r\n\r\n\r\nc/o COOK & SON, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA, ROME,\r\n\r\nApril 16th, 1900.\r\n\r\nMy dear Robbie,--I simply cannot write.  It is too horrid, not of me, but\r\nto me.  It is a mode of paralysis--a _cacoethes tacendi_--the one form\r\nthat malady takes in me.\r\n\r\nWell, all passed over very successfully.  Palermo, where we stayed eight\r\ndays, was lovely.  The most beautifully situated town in the world--it\r\ndreams away its life in the _concha d'oro_, the exquisite valley that\r\nlies between two seas.  The lemon groves and the orange gardens were so\r\nentirely perfect that I became quite a Pre-Raphaelite, and loathed the\r\nordinary impressionists whose muddly souls and blurred intelligences\r\nwould have rendered, but by mud and blur, those \"golden lamps hung in a\r\ngreen night\" that filled me with such joy.  The elaborate and exquisite\r\ndetail of the true Pre-Raphaelite is the compensation they offer us for\r\nthe absence of motion; literature and motion being the only arts that are\r\nnot immobile.\r\n\r\nThen nowhere, not even at Ravenna, have I seen such mosaics as in the\r\nCapella Palatine, which from pavement to domed ceiling is all gold: one\r\nreally feels as if one was sitting in the heart of a great honey-comb\r\nlooking at angels singing: and _looking_ at angels, or indeed at people,\r\nsinging, is much nicer than listening to them, for this reason: the great\r\nartists always give to their angels lutes without strings, pipes without\r\nvent-holes, and reeds through which no wind can wander or make\r\nwhistlings.\r\n\r\nMonreale you have heard of--with its cloisters and cathedral: we often\r\ndrove there.\r\n\r\nI also made great friends with a young seminarist, who lived in the\r\ncathedral of Palermo--he and eleven others, in little rooms beneath the\r\nroof, like birds.\r\n\r\nEvery day he showed me all over the cathedral, I knelt before the huge\r\nporphyry sarcophagus in which Frederick the Second lies: it is a sublime\r\nbare monstrous thing--blood-coloured, and held up by lions who have\r\ncaught some of the rage of the great Emperor's restless soul.  At first\r\nmy young friend, Giuseppe Loverdi, gave me information; but on the third\r\nday I gave information to him, and re-wrote history as usual, and told\r\nhim all about the supreme King and his Court of Poets, and the terrible\r\nbook that he never wrote.  His reason for entering the church was\r\nsingularly mediaeval.  I asked him why he thought of becoming a\r\n_clerico_, and how.  He answered: \"My father is a cook and most poor; and\r\nwe are many at home, so it seemed to me a good thing that there should be\r\nin so small a house as ours, one mouth less to feed; for though I am\r\nslim, I eat much, too much, alas! I fear.\"\r\n\r\nI told him to be comforted, because God used poverty often as a means of\r\nbringing people to Him, and used riches never, or rarely; so Giuseppe was\r\ncomforted, and I gave him a little book of devotion, very pretty, and\r\nwith far more pictures than prayers in it--so of great service to\r\nGiuseppe whose eyes are beautiful.  I also gave him many _lire_, and\r\nprophesied for him a Cardinal's hat, if he remained very good and never\r\nforgot me.\r\n\r\nAt Naples we stopped three days: most of my friends are, as you know, in\r\nprison, but I met some of nice memory.\r\n\r\nWe came to Rome on Holy Thursday.  H--- left on Saturday for Gland--and\r\nyesterday, to the terror of Grissell {5} and all the Papal Court, I\r\nappeared in the front rank of the pilgrims in the Vatican, and got the\r\nblessing of the Holy Father--a blessing they would have denied me.\r\n\r\nHe was wonderful as he was carried past me on his throne--not of flesh\r\nand blood, but a white soul robed in white and an artist as well as a\r\nsaint--the only instance in history, if the newspapers are to be\r\nbelieved.  I have seen nothing like the extraordinary grace of his\r\ngestures as he rose, from moment to moment, to bless--possibly the\r\npilgrims, but certainly me.\r\n\r\nTree should see him.  It is his only chance.\r\n\r\nI was deeply impressed, and my walking-stick showed signs of budding,\r\nwould have budded, indeed, only at the door of the Chapel it was taken\r\nfrom me by the Knave of Spades.  This strange prohibition is, of course,\r\nin honour of Tannhauser.\r\n\r\nHow did I get the ticket?  By a miracle, of course.  I thought it was\r\nhopeless and made no effort of any kind.  On Saturday afternoon at five\r\no'clock H--- and I went to have tea at the Hotel de l'Europe.  Suddenly,\r\nas I was eating buttered toast, a man--or what seemed to be one--dressed\r\nlike a hotel porter entered and asked me would I like to see the Pope on\r\nEaster Day.  I bowed my head humbly and said \"Non sum dignus,\" or words\r\nto that effect.  He at once produced a ticket!\r\n\r\nWhen I tell you that his countenance was of supernatural ugliness, and\r\nthat the price of the ticket was thirty pieces of silver, I need say no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAn equally curious thing is that whenever I pass the hotel, which I do\r\nconstantly, I see the same man.  Scientists call that phenomenon an\r\nobsession of the visual nerve.  You and I know better.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of Easter Day I heard Vespers at the Lateran: music\r\nquite lovely.  At the close, a Bishop in red, and with red gloves--such\r\nas Pater talks of in _Gaston de Latour_--came out on the balcony and\r\nshowed us the Relics.  He was swarthy, and wore a yellow mitre.  A\r\nsinister mediaeval man, but superbly Gothic, just like the bishops carved\r\non stalls or on portals: and when one thinks that once people mocked at\r\nstained-glass attitudes! they are the only attitudes for the clothes.  The\r\nsight of the Bishop, whom I watched with fascination, filled me with the\r\ngreat sense of the realism of Gothic art.  Neither in Greek art nor in\r\nGothic art is there any pose.  Posing was invented by bad\r\nportrait-painters; and the first person who posed was a stock-broker, and\r\nhe has gone on posing ever since.\r\n\r\nI send you a photograph I took on Palm Sunday at Palermo.  Do send me\r\nsome of yours, and love me always, and try to read this letter.\r\n\r\nKindest regards to your dear mother.\r\n\r\nAlways,\r\n\r\nOSCAR.\r\n\r\n--_Letter to Robert Ross_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n{1}  \"The Influence of Pater and Matthew Arnold in the Prose-Writings of\r\nOscar Wilde,\" by Ernst Bendz.

V. Lucas, no selections of\npoetry or prose have ever given complete satisfaction to anyone except\nthe compiler.  But critics derive great satisfaction from pointing out\nerrors of omission and inclusion on the part of the anthologist, and all","of us have putatively re-arranged and re-edited even the \"Golden\nTreasury\" in our leisure moments.  In an age when \"Art for Art's sake\" is\nan exploded doctrine, anthologies, like everything else, must have a\npurpose.  The purpose or object of the present volume is to afford\nadmirers of Wilde's work the same innocent pleasure obtainable from\nsimilar compilations, namely that of reconstructing a selection of their\nown in their mind's eye--for copyright considerations would interfere\nwith the materialisation of their dream.\n\nA stray observation in an esteemed weekly periodical determined the plan\nof this anthology and the choice of particular passages.  The writer,\r\nwhose name has escaped me, opined that the reason the works of Pater and\nWilde were no longer read was owing to both authors having treated\nEnglish as a dead language.  By a singular coincidence I had purchased\nsimultaneously with the newspaper a shilling copy of Pater's\n\"Renaissance,\" published by Messrs. Macmillan; and a few days afterwards\nMessrs. Methuen issued at a shilling the twenty-eighth edition of \"De\nProfundis.\"  Obviously either Messrs. Macmillan and Messrs. Methuen or\nthe authority on dead languages must have been suffering from\nhallucinations.  It occurred to me that a selection of Wilde's prose\nmight at least rehabilitate the notorious reputation for common sense\r\nenjoyed by all publishers, who rarely issue shilling editions of deceased\nauthors for mere aesthetic considerations.  And I confess to a hope that\nthis volume may reach the eye or ear of those who have not read Wilde's\nbooks, or of those, such as Mr. Sydney Grundy, who are irritated by the\nrevival of his plays and the praise accorded to his works throughout the\nContinent.\n\nWilde's prose is distinguished by its extraordinary ease and clarity, and\nby the absence--very singular in his case--of the preciosity which he\nadmired too much in other writers, and advocated with over-emphasis.\nPerhaps that is why many of his stories and essays and plays are used as\nEnglish text-books in Russian and Scandinavian and Hungarian schools.","Artifice and affectation, often assumed to be recurrent defects in his\nwritings by those unacquainted with them, are comparatively rare.  Wilde\nonce boasted in an interview that only Flaubert, Pater, Keats, and\nMaeterlinck had influenced him, and then added in a characteristic way:\n\"But I had already gone more than half-way to meet them.\"  Anyone curious\nas to the origin of Wilde's style and development should consult the\nlearned treatise {1} of Dr. Ernst Bendz, whose comprehensive treatment of\nthe subject renders any elucidation of mine superfluous; while nothing\ncan be added to Mr. Holbrook Jackson's masterly criticism {2} of Wilde\nand his position in literature.\r\nIn making this selection, with the valuable assistance of Mr. Stuart\nMason, I have endeavoured to illustrate and to justify the critical\nappreciations of both Dr. Bendz and Mr. Holbrook Jackson, as well as to\nafford the general reader a fair idea of Wilde's variety as a prose\nwriter.  He is more various than almost any author of the last century,\nthough the act of writing was always a burden to him.  Some critic\nacutely pointed out that poetry and prose were almost side-issues for\nhim.  The resulting faults and weakness of what he left are obvious.\nExcept in the plays he has no sustained scheme of thought.  Even \"De\nProfundis\" is too desultory.\n\nFor the purpose of convenient reference I have exercised the prerogative\r\nof a literary executor and editor by endowing with special titles some of\nthe pieces quoted in these pages.  Though unlike one of Wilde's other\nfriends I cannot claim to have collaborated with him or to have assisted\nhim in any of his plays, I was sometimes permitted, as Wilde acknowledges\nin different letters, to act in the capacity of godfather by suggesting\nthe actual titles by which some of his books are known to the world.  I\nmention the circumstance only as a precedent for my present temerity.  To\ncompensate those who disapprove of my choice, I have included two\nunpublished letters.  The examples of Wilde's epistolary style, published\nsince his death, have been generally associated with disagreeable","subjects.  Those included here will, I hope, prove a pleasant contrast.\n\nROBERT ROSS\n\n\n\n\nHOW THEY STRUCK A CONTEMPORARY\n\n\nThere is such a thing as robbing a story of its reality by trying to make\nit too true, and _The Black Arrow_ is so inartistic as not to contain a\nsingle anachronism to boast of, while the transformation of Dr. Jekyll\nreads dangerously like an experiment out of the _Lancet_.  As for Mr.\nRider Haggard, who really has, or had once, the makings of a perfectly\nmagnificent liar, he is now so afraid of being suspected of genius that\nwhen he does tell us anything marvellous, he feels bound to invent a\npersonal reminiscence, and to put it into a footnote as a kind of\r\ncowardly corroboration.  Nor are our other novelists much better.  Mr.\nHenry James writes fiction as if it were a painful duty, and wastes upon\nmean motives and imperceptible 'points of view' his neat literary style,\nhis felicitous phrases, his swift and caustic satire.  Mr. Hall Caine, it\nis true, aims at the grandiose, but then he writes at the top of his\nvoice.  He is so loud that one cannot bear what he says.  Mr. James Payn\nis an adept in the art of concealing what is not worth finding.  He hunts\ndown the obvious with the enthusiasm of a short-sighted detective.  As\none turns over the pages, the suspense of the author becomes almost\nunbearable.  The horses of Mr. William Black's phaeton do not soar\r\ntowards the sun.  They merely frighten the sky at evening into violent\nchromolithographic effects.  On seeing them approach, the peasants take\nrefuge in dialect.  Mrs. Oliphant prattles pleasantly about curates, lawn-\ntennis parties, domesticity, and other wearisome things.  Mr. Marion\nCrawford has immolated himself upon the altar of local colour.  He is\nlike the lady in the French comedy who keeps talking about \"le beau ciel\nd'Italie.\"  Besides, he has fallen into the bad habit of uttering moral\nplatitudes.  He is always telling us that to be good is to be good, and\nthat to be bad is to be wicked.  At times he is almost edifying.  _Robert","Elsmere_ is of course a masterpiece--a masterpiece of the \"genre\nennuyeux,\" the one form of literature that the English people seems\nthoroughly to enjoy.  A thoughtful young friend of ours once told us that\nit reminded him of the sort of conversation that goes on at a meat tea in\nthe house of a serious Nonconformist family, and we can quite believe it.\nIndeed it is only in England that such a book could be produced.  England\nis the home of lost ideas.  As for that great and daily increasing school\nof novelists for whom the sun always rises in the East-End, the only\nthing that can be said about them is that they find life crude, and leave\nit raw.--_The Decay of Lying_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE QUALITY OF GEORGE MEREDITH\r\nAh!  Meredith!  Who can define him?  His style is chaos illumined by\nflashes of lightning.  As a writer he has mastered everything except\nlanguage: as a novelist he can do everything, except tell a story: as an\nartist he is everything except articulate.  Somebody in\nShakespeare--Touchstone, I think--talks about a man who is always\nbreaking his shins over his own wit, and it seems to me that this might\nserve as the basis for a criticism of Meredith's method.  But whatever he\nis, he is not a realist.  Or rather I would say that he is a child of\nrealism who is not on speaking terms with his father.  By deliberate\nchoice he has made himself a romanticist.  He has refused to bow the knee\r\nto Baal, and after all, even if the man's fine spirit did not revolt\nagainst the noisy assertions of realism, his style would be quite\nsufficient of itself to keep life at a respectful distance.  By its means\nhe has planted round his garden a hedge full of thorns, and red with\nwonderful roses.  As for Balzac, he was a most remarkable combination of\nthe artistic temperament with the scientific spirit.  The latter he\nbequeathed to his disciples.  The former was entirely his own.  The\ndifference between such a book as M. Zola's _L'Assommoir_ and Balzac's\n_Illusions Perdues_ is the difference between unimaginative realism and\nimaginative reality.  'All Balzac's characters;' said Baudelaire, 'are","gifted with the same ardour of life that animated himself.  All his\nfictions are as deeply coloured as dreams.  Each mind is a weapon loaded\nto the muzzle with will.  The very scullions have genius.'  A steady\ncourse of Balzac reduces our living friends to shadows, and our\nacquaintances to the shadows of shades.  His characters have a kind of\nfervent fiery-coloured existence.  They dominate us, and defy scepticism.\nOne of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of Lucien de\nRubempre.  It is a grief from which I have never been able completely to\nrid myself.  It haunts me in my moments of pleasure.  I remember it when\nI laugh.  But Balzac is no more a realist than Holbein was.  He created\r\nlife, he did not copy it.  I admit, however, that he set far too high a\nvalue on modernity of form, and that, consequently, there is no book of\nhis that, as an artistic masterpiece, can rank with _Salammbo_ or\n_Esmond_, or _The Cloister and the Hearth_, or the _Vicomte de\nBragelonne_.--_The Decay of Lying_.\n\n\n\n\nLIFE THE FALLACIOUS MODEL\n\n\nArt begins with abstract decoration, with purely imaginative and\npleasurable work dealing with what is unreal and non-existent.  This is\nthe first stage.  Then Life becomes fascinated with this new wonder, and\nasks to be admitted into the charmed circle.  Art takes life as part of\nher rough material, recreates it, and refashions it in fresh forms, is\r\nabsolutely indifferent to fact, invents, imagines, dreams, and keeps\nbetween herself and reality the impenetrable barrier of beautiful style,\nof decorative or ideal treatment.  The third stage is when Life gets the\nupper hand, and drives Art out into the wilderness.  That is the true\ndecadence, and it is from this that we are now suffering.\n\nTake the case of the English drama.  At first in the hands of the monks\nDramatic Art was abstract, decorative and mythological.  Then she\nenlisted Life in her service, and using some of life's external forms,\nshe created an entirely new race of beings, whose sorrows were more\nterrible than any sorrow man has ever felt, whose joys were keener than","lover's joys, who had the rage of the Titans and the calm of the gods,\nwho had monstrous and marvellous sins, monstrous and marvellous virtues.\nTo them she gave a language different from that of actual use, a language\nfull of resonant music and sweet rhythm, made stately by solemn cadence,\nor made delicate by fanciful rhyme, jewelled with wonderful words, and\nenriched with lofty diction.  She clothed her children in strange raiment\nand gave them masks, and at her bidding the antique world rose from its\nmarble tomb.  A new Caesar stalked through the streets of risen Rome, and\nwith purple sail and flute-led oars another Cleopatra passed up the river\nto Antioch.  Old myth and legend and dream took shape and substance.\r\nHistory was entirely re-written, and there was hardly one of the\ndramatists who did not recognise that the object of Art is not simple\ntruth but complex beauty.  In this they were perfectly right.  Art itself\nis really a form of exaggeration; and selection, which is the very spirit\nof art, is nothing more than an intensified mode of over-emphasis.\n\nBut Life soon shattered the perfection of the form.  Even in Shakespeare\nwe can see the beginning of the end.  It shows itself by the gradual\nbreaking-up of the blank-verse in the later plays, by the predominance\ngiven to prose, and by the over-importance assigned to characterisation.\nThe passages in Shakespeare--and they are many--where the language is\r\nuncouth, vulgar, exaggerated, fantastic, obscene even, are entirely due\nto Life calling for an echo of her own voice, and rejecting the\nintervention of beautiful style, through which alone should life be\nsuffered to find expression.  Shakespeare is not by any means a flawless\nartist.  He is too fond of going directly to life, and borrowing life's\nnatural utterance.  He forgets that when Art surrenders her imaginative\nmedium she surrenders everything.--_The Decay of Lying_.\n\n\n\n\nLIFE THE DISCIPLE\n\n\nWe have all seen in our own day in England how a certain curious and\nfascinating type of beauty, invented and emphasised by two imaginative","painters, has so influenced Life that whenever one goes to a private view\nor to an artistic salon one sees, here the mystic eyes of Rossetti's\ndream, the long ivory throat, the strange square-cut jaw, the loosened\nshadowy hair that he so ardently loved, there the sweet maidenhood of\n'The Golden Stair,' the blossom-like mouth and weary loveliness of the\n'Laus Amoris,' the passion-pale face of Andromeda, the thin hands and\nlithe beauty of the Vivian in 'Merlin's Dream.'  And it has always been\nso.  A great artist invents a type, and Life tries to copy it, to\nreproduce it in a popular form, like an enterprising publisher.  Neither\nHolbein nor Vandyck found in England what they have given us.  They\r\nbrought their types with them, and Life with her keen imitative faculty\nset herself to supply the master with models.  The Greeks, with their\nquick artistic instinct, understood this, and set in the bride's chamber\nthe statue of Hermes or of Apollo, that she might bear children as lovely\nas the works of art that she looked at in her rapture or her pain.  They\nknew that Life gains from art not merely spirituality, depth of thought\nand feeling, soul-turmoil or soul-peace, but that she can form herself on\nthe very lines and colours of art, and can reproduce the dignity of\nPheidias as well as the grace of Praxiteles.  Hence came their objection\nto realism.  They disliked it on purely social grounds.  They felt that\r\nit inevitably makes people ugly, and they were perfectly right.  We try\nto improve the conditions of the race by means of good air, free\nsunlight, wholesome water, and hideous bare buildings for the better\nhousing of the lower orders.  But these things merely produce health,\nthey do not produce beauty.  For this, Art is required, and the true\ndisciples of the great artist are not his studio-imitators, but those who\nbecome like his works of art, be they plastic as in Greek days, or\npictorial as in modern times; in a word, Life is Art's best, Art's only\npupil.--_The Decay of Lying_.\n\n\n\n\nLIFE THE PLAGIARIST\n\n\nI once asked a lady, who knew Thackeray intimately, whether he had had","any model for Becky Sharp.  She told me that Becky was an invention, but\nthat the idea of the character had been partly suggested by a governess\nwho lived in the neighbourhood of Kensington Square, and was the\ncompanion of a very selfish and rich old woman.  I inquired what became\nof the governess, and she replied that, oddly enough, some years after\nthe appearance of _Vanity Fair_, she ran away with the nephew of the lady\nwith whom she was living, and for a short time made a great splash in\nsociety, quite in Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's style, and entirely by Mrs.\nRawdon Crawley's methods.  Ultimately she came to grief, disappeared to\nthe Continent, and used to be occasionally seen at Monte Carlo and other\r\ngambling places.  The noble gentleman from whom the same great\nsentimentalist drew Colonel Newcome died, a few months after _The\nNewcomer_ had reached a fourth edition, with the word 'Adsum' on his\nlips.  Shortly after Mr. Stevenson published his curious psychological\nstory of transformation, a friend of mine, called Mr. Hyde, was in the\nnorth of London, and being anxious to get to a railway station, took what\nhe thought would be a short cut, lost his way, and found himself in a\nnetwork of mean, evil-looking streets.  Feeling rather nervous he began\nto walk extremely fast, when suddenly out of an archway ran a child right\nbetween his legs.  It fell on the pavement, he tripped over it, and\r\ntrampled upon it.  Being of course very much frightened and a little\nhurt, it began to scream, and in a few seconds the whole street was full\nof rough people who came pouring out of the houses like ants.  They\nsurrounded him, and asked him his name.  He was just about to give it\nwhen he suddenly remembered the opening incident in Mr. Stevenson's\nstory.  He was so filled with horror at having realised in his own person\nthat terrible and well-written scene, and at having done accidentally,\nthough in fact, what the Mr. Hyde of fiction had done with deliberate\nintent, that he ran away as hard as he could go.  He was, however, very\nclosely followed, and finally he took refuge in a surgery, the door of","which happened to be open, where he explained to a young assistant, who\nhappened to be there, exactly what had occurred.  The humanitarian crowd\nwere induced to go away on his giving them a small sum of money, and as\nsoon as the coast was clear he left.  As he passed out, the name on the\nbrass door-plate of the surgery caught his eye.  It was 'Jekyll.'  At\nleast it should have been.--_The Decay of Lying_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE INDISPENSABLE EAST\n\n\nWhat is true about the drama and the novel is no less true about those\narts that we call the decorative arts.  The whole history of these arts\nin Europe is the record of the struggle between Orientalism, with its\r\nfrank rejection of imitation, its love of artistic convention, its\ndislike to the actual representation of any object in Nature, and our own\nimitative spirit.  Wherever the former has been paramount, as in\nByzantium, Sicily and Spain, by actual contact, or in the rest of Europe\nby the influence of the Crusades, we have had beautiful and imaginative\nwork in which the visible things of life are transmuted into artistic\nconventions, and the things that Life has not are invented and fashioned\nfor her delight.  But wherever we have returned to Life and Nature, our\nwork has always become vulgar, common and uninteresting.  Modern\ntapestry, with its aerial effects, its elaborate perspective, its broad\r\nexpanses of waste sky, its faithful and laborious realism, has no beauty\nwhatsoever.  The pictorial glass of Germany is absolutely detestable.  We\nare beginning to weave possible carpets in England, but only because we\nhave returned to the method and spirit of the East.  Our rugs and carpets\nof twenty years ago, with their solemn depressing truths, their inane\nworship of Nature, their sordid reproductions of visible objects, have\nbecome, even to the Philistine, a source of laughter.  A cultured\nMahomedan once remarked to us, \"You Christians are so occupied in\nmisinterpreting the fourth commandment that you have never thought of\nmaking an artistic application of the second.\"  He was perfectly right,","and the whole truth of the matter is this: The proper school to learn art\nin is not Life but Art.--_The Decay of Lying_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF THE IMPRESSIONISTS ON CLIMATE\n\n\nWhere, if not from the Impressionists, do we get those wonderful brown\nfogs that come creeping down our streets, blurring the gas-lamps and\nchanging the houses into monstrous shadows?  To whom, if not to them and\ntheir master, do we owe the lovely silver mists that brood over our\nriver, and turn to faint forms of fading grace curved bridge and swaying\nbarge?  The extraordinary change that has taken place in the climate of\nLondon during the last ten years is entirely due to a particular school\r\nof Art.  You smile.  Consider the matter from a scientific or a\nmetaphysical point of view, and you will find that I am right.  For what\nis Nature?  Nature is no great mother who has borne us.  She is our\ncreation.  It is in our brain that she quickens to life.  Things are\nbecause we see them, and what we see, and how we see it, depends on the\nArts that have influenced us.  To look at a thing is very different from\nseeing a thing.  One does not see anything until one sees its beauty.\nThen, and then only, does it come into existence.  At present, people see\nfogs, not because there are fogs, but because poets and painters have\ntaught them the mysterious loveliness of such effects.  There may have\r\nbeen fogs for centuries in London.  I dare say there were.  But no one\nsaw them, and so we do not know anything about them.  They did not exist\ntill Art had invented them.  Now, it must be admitted, fogs are carried\nto excess.  They have become the mere mannerism of a clique, and the\nexaggerated realism of their method gives dull people bronchitis.  Where\nthe cultured catch an effect, the uncultured catch cold.  And so, let us\nbe humane, and invite Art to turn her wonderful eyes elsewhere.  She has\ndone so already, indeed.  That white quivering sunlight that one sees now\nin France, with its strange blotches of mauve, and its restless violet\nshadows, is her latest fancy, and, on the whole, Nature reproduces it","quite admirably.  Where she used to give us Corots and Daubignys, she\ngives us now exquisite Monets and entrancing Pissaros.  Indeed there are\nmoments, rare, it is true, but still to be observed from time to time,\nwhen Nature becomes absolutely modern.  Of course she is not always to be\nrelied upon.  The fact is that she is in this unfortunate position.  Art\ncreates an incomparable and unique effect, and, having done so, passes on\nto other things.  Nature, upon the other hand, forgetting that imitation\ncan be made the sincerest form of insult, keeps on repeating this effect\nuntil we all become absolutely wearied of it.  Nobody of any real\nculture, for instance, ever talks nowadays about the beauty of a sunset.\r\nSunsets are quite old-fashioned.  They belong to the time when Turner was\nthe last note in art.  To admire them is a distinct sign of provincialism\nof temperament.  Upon the other hand they go on.--_The Decay of Lying_.\n\n\n\n\nAN EXPOSURE OF NATURALISM\n\n\nAfter all, what the imitative arts really give us are merely the various\nstyles of particular artists, or of certain schools of artists.  Surely\nyou don't imagine that the people of the Middle Ages bore any resemblance\nat all to the figures on mediaeval stained glass, or in mediaeval stone\nand wood carving, or on mediaeval metal-work, or tapestries, or\nilluminated MSS.  They were probably very ordinary-looking people, with\r\nnothing grotesque, or remarkable, or fantastic in their appearance.  The\nMiddle Ages, as we know them in art, are simply a definite form of style,\nand there is no reason at all why an artist with this style should not be\nproduced in the nineteenth century.  No great artist ever sees things as\nthey really are.  If he did, he would cease to be an artist.  Take an\nexample from our own day.  I know that you are fond of Japanese things.\nNow, do you really imagine that the Japanese people, as they are\npresented to us in art, have any existence?  If you do, you have never\nunderstood Japanese art at all.  The Japanese people are the deliberate\nself-conscious creation of certain individual artists.  If you set a","picture by Hokusai, or Hokkei, or any of the great native painters,\nbeside a real Japanese gentleman or lady, you will see that there is not\nthe slightest resemblance between them.  The actual people who live in\nJapan are not unlike the general run of English people; that is to say,\nthey are extremely commonplace, and have nothing curious or extraordinary\nabout them.  In fact the whole of Japan is a pure invention.  There is no\nsuch country, there are no such people.  One of our most charming\npainters {3} went recently to the Land of the Chrysanthemum in the\nfoolish hope of seeing the Japanese.  All he saw, all he had the chance\nof painting, were a few lanterns and some fans.  He was quite unable to\r\ndiscover the inhabitants, as his delightful exhibition at Messrs.\nDowdeswell's Gallery showed only too well.  He did not know that the\nJapanese people are, as I have said, simply a mode of style, an exquisite\nfancy of art.  And so, if you desire to see a Japanese effect, you will\nnot behave like a tourist and go to Tokio.  On the contrary, you will\nstay at home and steep yourself in the work of certain Japanese artists,\nand then, when you have absorbed the spirit of their style, and caught\ntheir imaginative manner of vision, you will go some afternoon and sit in\nthe Park or stroll down Piccadilly, and if you cannot see an absolutely\nJapanese effect there, you will not see it anywhere.  Or, to return again\r\nto the past, take as another instance the ancient Greeks.  Do you think\nthat Greek art ever tells us what the Greek people were like?  Do you\nbelieve that the Athenian women were like the stately dignified figures\nof the Parthenon frieze, or like those marvellous goddesses who sat in\nthe triangular pediments of the same building?  If you judge from the\nart, they certainly were so.  But read an authority, like Aristophanes,\nfor instance.  You will find that the Athenian ladies laced tightly, wore\nhigh-heeled shoes, dyed their hair yellow, painted and rouged their\nfaces, and were exactly like any silly fashionable or fallen creature of","our own day.  The fact is that we look back on the ages entirely through\nthe medium of art, and art, very fortunately, has never once told us the\ntruth.--_The Decay of Lying_.\n\n\n\n\nTHOMAS GRIFFITHS WAINEWRIGHT\n\n\nHe was taken back to Newgate, preparatory to his removal to the colonies.\nIn a fanciful passage in one of his early essays he had fancied himself\n'lying in Horsemonger Gaol under sentence of death' for having been\nunable to resist the temptation of stealing some Marc Antonios from the\nBritish Museum in order to complete his collection.  The sentence now\npassed on him was to a man of his culture a form of death.  He complained\nbitterly of it to his friends, and pointed out, with a good deal of\r\nreason, some people may fancy, that the money was practically his own,\nhaving come to him from his mother, and that the forgery, such as it was,\nhad been committed thirteen years before, which, to use his own phrase,\nwas at least a _circonstance attenuante_.  The permanence of personality\nis a very subtle metaphysical problem, and certainly the English law\nsolves the question in an extremely rough-and-ready manner.  There is,\nhowever, something dramatic in the fact that this heavy punishment was\ninflicted on him for what, if we remember his fatal influence on the\nprose of modern journalism, was certainly not the worst of all his sins.\n\nWhile he was in gaol, Dickens, Macready, and Hablot Browne came across\r\nhim by chance.  They had been going over the prisons of London, searching\nfor artistic effects, and in Newgate they suddenly caught sight of\nWainewright.  He met them with a defiant stare, Forster tells us, but\nMacready was 'horrified to recognise a man familiarly known to him in\nformer years, and at whose table he had dined.'\n\nOthers had more curiosity, and his cell was for some time a kind of\nfashionable lounge.  Many men of letters went down to visit their old\nliterary comrade.  But he was no longer the kind light-hearted Janus whom\nCharles Lamb admired.  He seems to have grown quite cynical.\n\nTo the agent of an insurance company who was visiting him one afternoon,","and thought he would improve the occasion by pointing out that, after\nall, crime was a bad speculation, he replied: 'Sir, you City men enter on\nyour speculations, and take the chances of them.  Some of your\nspeculations succeed, some fail.  Mine happen to have failed, yours\nhappen to have succeeded.  That is the only difference, sir, between my\nvisitor and me.  But, sir, I will tell you one thing in which I have\nsucceeded to the last.  I have been determined through life to hold the\nposition of a gentleman.  I have always done so.  I do so still.  It is\nthe custom of this place that each of the inmates of a cell shall take\nhis morning's turn of sweeping it out.  I occupy a cell with a bricklayer\r\nand a sweep, but they never offer me the broom!'  When a friend\nreproached him with the murder of Helen Abercrombie he shrugged his\nshoulders and said, 'Yes; it was a dreadful thing to do, but she had very\nthick ankles.'--_Pen, Pencil and Poison_.\n\n\n\n\nWAINEWRIGHT AT HOBART TOWN\n\n\nHis love of art, however, never deserted him.  At Hobart Town he started\na studio, and returned to sketching and portrait-painting, and his\nconversation and manners seem not to have lost their charm.  Nor did he\ngive up his habit of poisoning, and there are two cases on record in\nwhich he tried to make away with people who had offended him.  But his\nhand seems to have lost its cunning.  Both of his attempts were complete\r\nfailures, and in 1844, being thoroughly dissatisfied with Tasmanian\nsociety, he presented a memorial to the governor of the settlement, Sir\nJohn Eardley Wilmot, praying for a ticket-of-leave.  In it he speaks of\nhimself as being 'tormented by ideas struggling for outward form and\nrealisation, barred up from increase of knowledge, and deprived of the\nexercise of profitable or even of decorous speech.'  His request,\nhowever, was refused, and the associate of Coleridge consoled himself by\nmaking those marvellous _Paradis Artificiels_ whose secret is only known\nto the eaters of opium.  In 1852 he died of apoplexy, his sole living\ncompanion being a cat, for which he had evinced at extraordinary","affection.\n\nHis crimes seem to have had an important effect upon his art.  They gave\na strong personality to his style, a quality that his early work\ncertainly lacked.  In a note to the _Life of Dickens_, Forster mentions\nthat in 1847 Lady Blessington received from her brother, Major Power, who\nheld a military appointment at Hobart Town, an oil portrait of a young\nlady from his clever brush; and it is said that 'he had contrived to put\nthe expression of his own wickedness into the portrait of a nice, kind-\nhearted girl.'  M. Zola, in one of his novels, tells us of a young man\nwho, having committed a murder, takes to art, and paints greenish\r\nimpressionist portraits of perfectly respectable people, all of which\nbear a curious resemblance to his victim.  The development of Mr.\nWainewright's style seems to me far more subtle and suggestive.  One can\nfancy an intense personality being created out of sin.--_Pen, Pencil and\nPoison_.\n\n\n\n\nCARDINAL NEWMAN AND THE AUTOBIOGRAPHERS\n\n\nIn literature mere egotism is delightful.  It is what fascinates us in\nthe letters of personalities so different as Cicero and Balzac, Flaubert\nand Berlioz, Byron and Madame de Sevigne.  Whenever we come across it,\nand, strangely enough, it is rather rare, we cannot but welcome it, and\ndo not easily forget it.  Humanity will always love Rousseau for having\r\nconfessed his sins, not to a priest, but to the world, and the couchant\nnymphs that Cellini wrought in bronze for the castle of King Francis, the\ngreen and gold Perseus, even, that in the open Loggia at Florence shows\nthe moon the dead terror that once turned life to stone, have not given\nit more pleasure than has that autobiography in which the supreme\nscoundrel of the Renaissance relates the story of his splendour and his\nshame.  The opinions, the character, the achievements of the man, matter\nvery little.  He may be a sceptic like the gentle Sieur de Montaigne, or\na saint like the bitter son of Monica, but when he tells us his own\nsecrets he can always charm our ears to listening and our lips to","silence.  The mode of thought that Cardinal Newman represented--if that\ncan be called a mode of thought which seeks to solve intellectual\nproblems by a denial of the supremacy of the intellect--may not, cannot,\nI think, survive.  But the world will never weary of watching that\ntroubled soul in its progress from darkness to darkness.  The lonely\nchurch at Littlemore, where 'the breath of the morning is damp, and\nworshippers are few,' will always be dear to it, and whenever men see the\nyellow snapdragon blossoming on the wall of Trinity they will think of\nthat gracious undergraduate who saw in the flower's sure recurrence a\nprophecy that he would abide for ever with the Benign Mother of his\r\ndays--a prophecy that Faith, in her wisdom or her folly, suffered not to\nbe fulfilled.  Yes; autobiography is irresistible.--_The Critic as\nArtist_.\n\n\n\n\nROBERT BROWNING\n\n\nTaken as a whole the man was great.  He did not belong to the Olympians,\nand had all the incompleteness of the Titan.  He did not survey, and it\nwas but rarely that he could sing.  His work is marred by struggle,\nviolence and effort, and he passed not from emotion to form, but from\nthought to chaos.  Still, he was great.  He has been called a thinker,\nand was certainly a man who was always thinking, and always thinking\naloud; but it was not thought that fascinated him, but rather the\r\nprocesses by which thought moves.  It was the machine he loved, not what\nthe machine makes.  The method by which the fool arrives at his folly was\nas dear to him as the ultimate wisdom of the wise.  So much, indeed, did\nthe subtle mechanism of mind fascinate him that he despised language, or\nlooked upon it as an incomplete instrument of expression.  Rhyme, that\nexquisite echo which in the Muse's hollow hill creates and answers its\nown voice; rhyme, which in the hands of the real artist becomes not\nmerely a material element of metrical beauty, but a spiritual element of\nthought and passion also, waking a new mood, it may be, or stirring a\nfresh train of ideas, or opening by mere sweetness and suggestion of","sound some golden door at which the Imagination itself had knocked in\nvain; rhyme, which can turn man's utterance to the speech of gods; rhyme,\nthe one chord we have added to the Greek lyre, became in Robert\nBrowning's hands a grotesque, misshapen thing, which at times made him\nmasquerade in poetry as a low comedian, and ride Pegasus too often with\nhis tongue in his cheek.  There are moments when he wounds us by\nmonstrous music.  Nay, if he can only get his music by breaking the\nstrings of his lute, he breaks them, and they snap in discord, and no\nAthenian tettix, making melody from tremulous wings, lights on the ivory\nhorn to make the movement perfect, or the interval less harsh.  Yet, he\r\nwas great: and though he turned language into ignoble clay, he made from\nit men and women that live.  He is the most Shakespearian creature since\nShakespeare.  If Shakespeare could sing with myriad lips, Browning could\nstammer through a thousand mouths.  Even now, as I am speaking, and\nspeaking not against him but for him, there glides through the room the\npageant of his persons.  There, creeps Fra Lippo Lippi with his cheeks\nstill burning from some girl's hot kiss.  There, stands dread Saul with\nthe lordly male-sapphires gleaming in his turban.  Mildred Tresham is\nthere, and the Spanish monk, yellow with hatred, and Blougram, and Ben\nEzra, and the Bishop of St. Praxed's.  The spawn of Setebos gibbers in\r\nthe corner, and Sebald, hearing Pippa pass by, looks on Ottima's haggard\nface, and loathes her and his own sin, and himself.  Pale as the white\nsatin of his doublet, the melancholy king watches with dreamy treacherous\neyes too loyal Strafford pass forth to his doom, and Andrea shudders as\nhe hears the cousins whistle in the garden, and bids his perfect wife go\ndown.  Yes, Browning was great.  And as what will he be remembered?  As a\npoet?  Ah, not as a poet!  He will be remembered as a writer of fiction,\nas the most supreme writer of fiction, it may be, that we have ever had.\nHis sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled, and, if he could not","answer his own problems, he could at least put problems forth, and what\nmore should an artist do?  Considered from the point of view of a creator\nof character he ranks next to him who made Hamlet.  Had he been\narticulate, he might have sat beside him.  The only man who can touch the\nhem of his garment is George Meredith.  Meredith is a prose Browning, and\nso is Browning. He used poetry as a medium for writing in prose.--_The\nCritic as Artist_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TWO SUPREME AND HIGHEST ARTS\n\n\nLife and Literature, life and the perfect expression of life.  The\nprinciples of the former, as laid down by the Greeks, we may not realise\nin an age so marred by false ideals as our own.  The principles of the\r\nlatter, as they laid them down, are, in many cases, so subtle that we can\nhardly understand them.  Recognising that the most perfect art is that\nwhich most fully mirrors man in all his infinite variety, they elaborated\nthe criticism of language, considered in the light of the mere material\nof that art, to a point to which we, with our accentual system of\nreasonable or emotional emphasis, can barely if at all attain; studying,\nfor instance, the metrical movements of a prose as scientifically as a\nmodern musician studies harmony and counterpoint, and, I need hardly say,\nwith much keener aesthetic instinct.  In this they were right, as they\nwere right in all things.  Since the introduction of printing, and the\r\nfatal development of the habit of reading amongst the middle and lower\nclasses of this country, there has been a tendency in literature to\nappeal more and more to the eye, and less and less to the ear which is\nreally the sense which, from the standpoint of pure art, it should seek\nto please, and by whose canons of pleasure it should abide always.  Even\nthe work of Mr. Pater, who is, on the whole, the most perfect master of\nEnglish prose now creating amongst us, is often far more like a piece of\nmosaic than a passage in music, and seems, here and there, to lack the\ntrue rhythmical life of words and the fine freedom and richness of effect","that such rhythmical life produces.  We, in fact, have made writing a\ndefinite mode of composition, and have treated it as a form of elaborate\ndesign.  The Greeks, upon the other hand, regarded writing simply as a\nmethod of chronicling.  Their test was always the spoken word in its\nmusical and metrical relations.  The voice was the medium, and the ear\nthe critic.  I have sometimes thought that the story of Homer's blindness\nmight be really an artistic myth, created in critical days, and serving\nto remind us, not merely that the great poet is always a seer, seeing\nless with the eyes of the body than he does with the eyes of the soul,\nbut that he is a true singer also, building his song out of music,\r\nrepeating each line over and over again to himself till he has caught the\nsecret of its melody, chaunting in darkness the words that are winged\nwith light.  Certainly, whether this be so or not, it was to his\nblindness, as an occasion, if not as a cause, that England's great poet\nowed much of the majestic movement and sonorous splendour of his later\nverse.  When Milton could no longer write he began to sing.--_The Critic\nas Artist_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECRETS OF IMMORTALITY\n\n\nOn the mouldering citadel of Troy lies the lizard like a thing of green\nbronze.  The owl has built her nest in the palace of Priam.  Over the\nempty plain wander shepherd and goatherd with their flocks, and where, on\r\nthe wine-surfaced, oily sea, [Greek text], as Homer calls it,\ncopper-prowed and streaked with vermilion, the great galleys of the\nDanaoi came in their gleaming crescent, the lonely tunny-fisher sits in\nhis little boat and watches the bobbing corks of his net.  Yet, every\nmorning the doors of the city are thrown open, and on foot, or in horse-\ndrawn chariot, the warriors go forth to battle, and mock their enemies\nfrom behind their iron masks.  All day long the fight rages, and when\nnight comes the torches gleam by the tents, and the cresset burns in the\nhall.  Those who live in marble or on painted panel, know of life but a\nsingle exquisite instant, eternal indeed in its beauty, but limited to","one note of passion or one mood of calm.  Those whom the poet makes live\nhave their myriad emotions of joy and terror, of courage and despair, of\npleasure and of suffering.  The seasons come and go in glad or saddening\npageant, and with winged or leaden feet the years pass by before them.\nThey have their youth and their manhood, they are children, and they grow\nold.  It is always dawn for St. Helena, as Veronese saw her at the\nwindow.  Through the still morning air the angels bring her the symbol of\nGod's pain.  The cool breezes of the morning lift the gilt threads from\nher brow.  On that little hill by the city of Florence, where the lovers\r\nof Giorgione are lying, it is always the solstice of noon, of noon made\nso languorous by summer suns that hardly can the slim naked girl dip into\nthe marble tank the round bubble of clear glass, and the long fingers of\nthe lute-player rest idly upon the chords.  It is twilight always for the\ndancing nymphs whom Corot set free among the silver poplars of France.  In\neternal twilight they move, those frail diaphanous figures, whose\ntremulous white feet seem not to touch the dew-drenched grass they tread\non.  But those who walk in epos, drama, or romance, see through the\nlabouring months the young moons wax and wane, and watch the night from\nevening unto morning star, and from sunrise unto sunsetting can note the\r\nshifting day with all its gold and shadow.  For them, as for us, the\nflowers bloom and wither, and the Earth, that Green-tressed Goddess as\nColeridge calls her, alters her raiment for their pleasure.  The statue\nis concentrated to one moment of perfection.  The image stained upon the\ncanvas possesses no spiritual element of growth or change.  If they know\nnothing of death, it is because they know little of life, for the secrets\nof life and death belong to those, and those only, whom the sequence of\ntime affects, and who possess not merely the present but the future, and\ncan rise or fall from a past of glory or of shame.  Movement, that\nproblem of the visible arts, can be truly realised by Literature alone.","It is Literature that shows us the body in its swiftness and the soul in\nits unrest.--_The Critic as Artist_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CRITIC AND HIS MATERIAL\n\n\nWho cares whether Mr. Ruskin's views on Turner are sound or not?  What\ndoes it matter?  That mighty and majestic prose of his, so fervid and so\nfiery-coloured in its noble eloquence, so rich in its elaborate symphonic\nmusic, so sure and certain, at its best, in subtle choice of word and\nepithet, is at least as great a work of art as any of those wonderful\nsunsets that bleach or rot on their corrupted canvases in England's\nGallery; greater indeed, one is apt to think at times, not merely because\nits equal beauty is more enduring, but on account of the fuller variety\r\nof its appeal, soul speaking to soul in those long-cadenced lines, not\nthrough form and colour alone, though through these, indeed, completely\nand without loss, but with intellectual and emotional utterance, with\nlofty passion and with loftier thought, with imaginative insight, and\nwith poetic aim; greater, I always think, even as Literature is the\ngreater art.  Who, again, cares whether Mr. Pater has put into the\nportrait of Monna Lisa something that Lionardo never dreamed of?  The\npainter may have been merely the slave of an archaic smile, as some have\nfancied, but whenever I pass into the cool galleries of the Palace of the\nLouvre, and stand before that strange figure 'set in its marble chair in\r\nthat cirque of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea,' I\nmurmur to myself, 'She is older than the rocks among which she sits; like\nthe vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the\ngrave; and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day\nabout her: and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants; and,\nas Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as St. Anne, the mother of\nMary; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes,\nand lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing\nlineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands.'  And I say to my\nfriend, 'The presence that thus so strangely rose beside the waters is","expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years man had come to\ndesire'; and he answers me, 'Hers is the head upon which all \"the ends of\nthe world are come,\" and the eyelids are a little weary.'\n\nAnd so the picture becomes more wonderful to us than it really is, and\nreveals to us a secret of which, in truth, it knows nothing, and the\nmusic of the mystical prose is as sweet in our ears as was that flute-\nplayer's music that lent to the lips of La Gioconda those subtle and\npoisonous curves.  Do you ask me what Lionardo would have said had any\none told him of this picture that 'all the thoughts and experience of the\nworld had etched and moulded therein that which they had of power to\r\nrefine and make expressive the outward form, the animalism of Greece, the\nlust of Rome, the reverie of the Middle Age with its spiritual ambition\nand imaginative loves, the return of the Pagan world, the sins of the\nBorgias?'  He would probably have answered that he had contemplated none\nof these things, but had concerned himself simply with certain\narrangements of lines and masses, and with new and curious\ncolour-harmonies of blue and green.  And it is for this very reason that\nthe criticism which I have quoted is criticism of the highest kind.  It\ntreats the work of art simply as a starting-point for a new creation.  It\ndoes not confine itself--let us at least suppose so for the moment--to\r\ndiscovering the real intention of the artist and accepting that as final.\nAnd in this it is right, for the meaning of any beautiful created thing\nis, at least, as much in the soul of him who looks at it, as it was in\nhis soul who wrought it.  Nay, it is rather the beholder who lends to the\nbeautiful thing its myriad meanings, and makes it marvellous for us, and\nsets it in some new relation to the age, so that it becomes a vital\nportion of our lives, and a symbol of what we pray for, or perhaps of\nwhat, having prayed for, we fear that we may receive.--_The Critic as\nArtist_.\n\n\n\n\nDANTE THE LIVING GUIDE\n\n\nThere is no mood or passion that Art cannot give us, and those of us who","have discovered her secret can settle beforehand what our experiences are\ngoing to be.  We can choose our day and select our hour.  We can say to\nourselves, 'To-morrow, at dawn, we shall walk with grave Virgil through\nthe valley of the shadow of death,' and lo! the dawn finds us in the\nobscure wood, and the Mantuan stands by our side.  We pass through the\ngate of the legend fatal to hope, and with pity or with joy behold the\nhorror of another world.  The hypocrites go by, with their painted faces\nand their cowls of gilded lead.  Out of the ceaseless winds that drive\nthem, the carnal look at us, and we watch the heretic rending his flesh,\nand the glutton lashed by the rain.  We break the withered branches from\r\nthe tree in the grove of the Harpies, and each dull-hued poisonous twig\nbleeds with red blood before us, and cries aloud with bitter cries.  Out\nof a horn of fire Odysseus speaks to us, and when from his sepulchre of\nflame the great Ghibelline rises, the pride that triumphs over the\ntorture of that bed becomes ours for a moment.  Through the dim purple\nair fly those who have stained the world with the beauty of their sin,\nand in the pit of loathsome disease, dropsy-stricken and swollen of body\ninto the semblance of a monstrous lute, lies Adamo di Brescia, the coiner\nof false coin.  He bids us listen to his misery; we stop, and with dry\r\nand gaping lips he tells us how he dreams day and night of the brooks of\nclear water that in cool dewy channels gush down the green Casentine\nhills.  Sinon, the false Greek of Troy, mocks at him.  He smites him in\nthe face, and they wrangle.  We are fascinated by their shame, and\nloiter, till Virgil chides us and leads us away to that city turreted by\ngiants where great Nimrod blows his horn.  Terrible things are in store\nfor us, and we go to meet them in Dante's raiment and with Dante's heart.\nWe traverse the marshes of the Styx, and Argenti swims to the boat\nthrough the slimy waves.  He calls to us, and we reject him.  When we\nhear the voice of his agony we are glad, and Virgil praises us for the","bitterness of our scorn.  We tread upon the cold crystal of Cocytus, in\nwhich traitors stick like straws in glass.  Our foot strikes against the\nhead of Bocca.  He will not tell us his name, and we tear the hair in\nhandfuls from the screaming skull.  Alberigo prays us to break the ice\nupon his face that he may weep a little.  We pledge our word to him, and\nwhen he has uttered his dolorous tale we deny the word that we have\nspoken, and pass from him; such cruelty being courtesy indeed, for who\nmore base than he who has mercy for the condemned of God?  In the jaws of\nLucifer we see the man who sold Christ, and in the jaws of Lucifer the\nmen who slew Caesar.  We tremble, and come forth to re-behold the\r\nstars.--_The Critic as Artist_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LIMITATIONS OF GENIUS\n\n\nThe appeal of all Art is simply to the artistic temperament.  Art does\nnot address herself to the specialist.  Her claim is that she is\nuniversal, and that in all her manifestations she is one.  Indeed, so far\nfrom its being true that the artist is the best judge of art, a really\ngreat artist can never judge of other people's work at all, and can\nhardly, in fact, judge of his own.  That very concentration of vision\nthat makes a man an artist, limits by its sheer intensity his faculty of\nfine appreciation.  The energy of creation hurries him blindly on to his\nown goal.  The wheels of his chariot raise the dust as a cloud around\r\nhim.  The gods are hidden from each other.  They can recognise their\nworshippers.  That is all . . . Wordsworth saw in _Endymion_ merely a\npretty piece of Paganism, and Shelley, with his dislike of actuality, was\ndeaf to Wordsworth's message, being repelled by its form, and Byron, that\ngreat passionate human incomplete creature, could appreciate neither the\npoet of the cloud nor the poet of the lake, and the wonder of Keats was\nhidden from him.  The realism of Euripides was hateful to Sophokles.\nThose droppings of warm tears had no music for him.  Milton, with his\nsense of the grand style, could not understand the method of Shakespeare,","any more than could Sir Joshua the method of Gainsborough.  Bad artists\nalways admire each other's work.  They call it being large-minded and\nfree from prejudice.  But a truly great artist cannot conceive of life\nbeing shown, or beauty fashioned, under any conditions other than those\nthat he has selected.  Creation employs all its critical faculty within\nits own sphere.  It may not use it in the sphere that belongs to others.\nIt is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is the proper judge\nof it.--_The Critic as Artist_.\n\n\n\n\nWANTED A NEW BACKGROUND\n\n\nHe who would stir us now by fiction must either give us an entirely new\nbackground, or reveal to us the soul of man in its innermost workings.\r\nThe first is for the moment being done for us by Mr. Rudyard Kipling.  As\none turns over the pages of his _Plain Tales from the Hills_, one feels\nas if one were seated under a palm-tree reading life by superb flashes of\nvulgarity.  The bright colours of the bazaars dazzle one's eyes.  The\njaded, second-rate Anglo-Indians are in exquisite incongruity with their\nsurroundings.  The mere lack of style in the story-teller gives an odd\njournalistic realism to what he tells us.  From the point of view of\nliterature Mr. Kipling is a genius who drops his aspirates.  From the\npoint of view of life, he is a reporter who knows vulgarity better than\nany one has ever known it.  Dickens knew its clothes and its comedy.  Mr.\r\nKipling knows its essence and its seriousness.  He is our first authority\non the second-rate, and has seen marvellous things through keyholes, and\nhis backgrounds are real works of art.  As for the second condition, we\nhave had Browning, and Meredith is with us.  But there is still much to\nbe done in the sphere of introspection.  People sometimes say that\nfiction is getting too morbid.  As far as psychology is concerned, it has\nnever been morbid enough.  We have merely touched the surface of the\nsoul, that is all.  In one single ivory cell of the brain there are\nstored away things more marvellous and more terrible than even they have\ndreamed of, who, like the author of _Le Rouge et le Noir_, have sought to","track the soul into its most secret places, and to make life confess its\ndearest sins.  Still, there is a limit even to the number of untried\nbackgrounds, and it is possible that a further development of the habit\nof introspection may prove fatal to that creative faculty to which it\nseeks to supply fresh material.  I myself am inclined to think that\ncreation is doomed.  It springs from too primitive, too natural an\nimpulse.  However this may be, it is certain that the subject-matter at\nthe disposal of creation is always diminishing, while the subject-matter\nof criticism increases daily.  There are always new attitudes for the\nmind, and new points of view.  The duty of imposing form upon chaos does\r\nnot grow less as the world advances.  There was never a time when\nCriticism was more needed than it is now.  It is only by its means that\nHumanity can become conscious of the point at which it has arrived.--_The\nCritic as Artist_.\n\n\n\n\nWITHOUT FRONTIERS\n\n\nGoethe--you will not misunderstand what I say--was a German of the\nGermans.  He loved his country--no man more so.  Its people were dear to\nhim; and he led them.  Yet, when the iron hoof of Napoleon trampled upon\nvineyard and cornfield, his lips were silent.  'How can one write songs\nof hatred without hating?' he said to Eckermann, 'and how could I, to\nwhom culture and barbarism are alone of importance, hate a nation which\r\nis among the most cultivated of the earth and to which I owe so great a\npart of my own cultivation?'  This note, sounded in the modern world by\nGoethe first, will become, I think, the starting point for the\ncosmopolitanism of the future.  Criticism will annihilate\nrace-prejudices, by insisting upon the unity of the human mind in the\nvariety of its forms.  If we are tempted to make war upon another nation,\nwe shall remember that we are seeking to destroy an element of our own\nculture, and possibly its most important element.  As long as war is\nregarded as wicked, it will always have its fascination.  When it is\nlooked upon as vulgar, it will cease to be popular.  The change will of","course be slow, and people will not be conscious of it.  They will not\nsay 'We will not war against France because her prose is perfect,' but\nbecause the prose of France is perfect, they will not hate the land.\nIntellectual criticism will bind Europe together in bonds far closer than\nthose that can be forged by shopman or sentimentalist.  It will give us\nthe peace that springs from understanding.--_The Critic as Artist_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE POETRY OF ARCHAEOLOGY\n\n\nInfessura tells us that in 1485 some workmen digging on the Appian Way\ncame across an old Roman sarcophagus inscribed with the name 'Julia,\ndaughter of Claudius.'  On opening the coffer they found within its\nmarble womb the body of a beautiful girl of about fifteen years of age,\r\npreserved by the embalmer's skill from corruption and the decay of time.\nHer eyes were half open, her hair rippled round her in crisp curling\ngold, and from her lips and cheek the bloom of maidenhood had not yet\ndeparted.  Borne back to the Capitol, she became at once the centre of a\nnew cult, and from all parts of the city crowded pilgrims to worship at\nthe wonderful shrine, till the Pope, fearing lest those who had found the\nsecret of beauty in a Pagan tomb might forget what secrets Judaea's rough\nand rock-hewn sepulchre contained, had the body conveyed away by night,\nand in secret buried.  Legend though it may be, yet the story is none the\r\nless valuable as showing us the attitude of the Renaissance towards the\nantique world.  Archaeology to them was not a mere science for the\nantiquarian; it was a means by which they could touch the dry dust of\nantiquity into the very breath and beauty of life, and fill with the new\nwine of romanticism forms that else had been old and outworn.  From the\npulpit of Niccola Pisano down to Mantegna's 'Triumph of Caesar,' and the\nservice Cellini designed for King Francis, the influence of this spirit\ncan be traced; nor was it confined merely to the immobile arts--the arts\nof arrested movement--but its influence was to be seen also in the great\nGraeco-Roman masques which were the constant amusement of the gay courts","of the time, and in the public pomps and processions with which the\ncitizens of big commercial towns were wont to greet the princes that\nchanced to visit them; pageants, by the way, which were considered so\nimportant that large prints were made of them and published--a fact which\nis a proof of the general interest at the time in matters of such\nkind.--_The Truth of Masks_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ART OF ARCHAEOLOGY\n\n\nIndeed archaeology is only really delightful when transfused into some\nform of art.  I have no desire to underrate the services of laborious\nscholars, but I feel that the use Keats made of Lempriere's Dictionary is\nof far more value to us than Professor Max Muller's treatment of the same\r\nmythology as a disease of language.  Better _Endymion_ than any theory,\nhowever sound, or, as in the present instance, unsound, of an epidemic\namong adjectives!  And who does not feel that the chief glory of\nPiranesi's book on Vases is that it gave Keats the suggestion for his\n'Ode on a Grecian Urn'?  Art, and art only, can make archaeology\nbeautiful; and the theatric art can use it most directly and most\nvividly, for it can combine in one exquisite presentation the illusion of\nactual life with the wonder of the unreal world.  But the sixteenth\ncentury was not merely the age of Vitruvius; it was the age of Vecellio\nalso.  Every nation seems suddenly to have become interested in the dress\r\nof its neighbours.  Europe began to investigate its own clothes, and the\namount of books published on national costumes is quite extraordinary.  At\nthe beginning of the century the _Nuremberg Chronicle_, with its two\nthousand illustrations, reached its fifth edition, and before the century\nwas over seventeen editions were published of Munster's _Cosmography_.\nBesides these two books there were also the works of Michael Colyns, of\nHans Weigel, of Amman, and of Vecellio himself, all of them well\nillustrated, some of the drawings in Vecellio being probably from the\nhand of Titian.\n\nNor was it merely from books and treatises that they acquired their","knowledge.  The development of the habit of foreign travel, the increased\ncommercial intercourse between countries, and the frequency of diplomatic\nmissions, gave every nation many opportunities of studying the various\nforms of contemporary dress.  After the departure from England, for\ninstance, of the ambassadors from the Czar, the Sultan and the Prince of\nMorocco, Henry the Eighth and his friends gave several masques in the\nstrange attire of their visitors.  Later on London saw, perhaps too\noften, the sombre splendour of the Spanish Court, and to Elizabeth came\nenvoys from all lands, whose dress, Shakespeare tells us, had an\nimportant influence on English costume.--_The Truth of Masks_.\n\n\n\n\nHEROD SUPPLIANT\r\nNon, non, vous ne voulez pas cela.

Aussi peut-etre que s'il mourrait, il m'arriverait un\nmalheur.  Enfin, il a dit que le jour ou il mourrait il arriverait un\nmalheur a quelqu'un.  Ce ne peut etre qu'a moi.  Souvenez-vous, j'ai\nglisse dans le sang quand je suis entre ici.  Aussi j'ai entendu un\nbattement d'ailes dans l'air, un battement d'ailes gigantesques.  Ce sont\nde tres mauvais presages.  Et il y en avait d'autres.  Je suis sur qu'il\ny en avait d'autres, quoique je ne les aie pas vus.  Eh bien!  Salome,\r\nvous ne voulez pas qu'un malheur m'arrive?  Vous ne voulez pas\ncela.--_Salome_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TETRARCH'S TREASURE\n\n\nMoi, je suis tres calme.  Je suis tout a fait calme.  Ecoutez.  J'ai des\nbijoux caches ici que meme votre mere n'a jamais vus, des bijoux tout a\nfait extraordinaires.  J'ai un collier de perles a quatre rangs.  On\ndirait des lunes enchainees de rayons d'argent.  On dirait cinquante\nlunes captives dans un filet d'or.  Une reine l'a porte sur l'ivoire de\nses seins.  Toi, quand tu le porteras, tu seras aussi belle qu'une reine.\nJ'ai des amethystes de deux especes.  Une qui est noire comme le vin.\nL'autre qui est rouge comme du vin qu'on a colore avec de l'eau.  J'ai","des topazes jaunes comme les yeux des tigres, et des topazes roses comme\nles yeux des pigeons, et des topazes vertes comme les yeux des chats.\nJ'ai des opales qui brulent toujours avec une flamme qui est tres froide,\ndes opales qui attristent les esprits et ont peur des tenebres.  J'ai des\nonyx semblables aux prunelles d'une morte.  J'ai des selenites qui\nchangent quand la lune change et deviennent pales quand elles voient le\nsoleil.  J'ai des saphirs grands comme des oeufs et bleus comme des\nfleurs bleues.  La mer erre dedans, et la lune ne vient jamais troubler\nle bleu de ses flots.  J'ai des chrysolithes et des beryls, j'ai des\nchrysoprases et des rubis, j'ai des sardonyx et des hyacinthes, et des\r\ncalcedoines et je vous les donnerai tous, mais tous, et j'ajouterai\nd'autres choses.  Le roi des Indes vient justement de m'envoyer quatre\neventails faits de plumes de perroquets, et le roi de Numidie une robe\nfaite de plumes d'autruche.  J'ai un cristal qu'il n'est pas permis aux\nfemmes de voir et que meme les jeunes hommes ne doivent regarder qu'apres\navoir ete flagelles de verges.  Dans un coffret de nacre j'ai trois\nturquoises merveilleuses.  Quand on les porte sur le front on peut\nimaginer des choses qui n'existent pas, et quand on les porte dans la\nmain on peut rendre les femmes steriles.  Ce sont des tresors de grande\nvaleur.  Ce sont des tresors sans prix.  Et ce n'est pas tout.  Dans un\r\ncoffret d'ebene j'ai deux coupes d'ambre qui ressemblent a des pommes\nd'or.  Si un ennemi verse du poison dans ces coupes elles deviennent\ncomme des pommes d'argent.  Dans un coffret incruste d'ambre j'ai des\nsandales incrustees de verre.  J'ai des manteaux qui viennent du pays des\nSeres et des bracelets garnis d'escarboucles et de jade qui viennent de\nla ville d'Euphrate. . . Enfin, que veux-tu, Salome?  Dis-moi ce que tu\ndesires et je te le donnerai.  Je te donnerai tout ce que tu demanderas,\nsauf une chose.  Je te donnerai tout ce que je possede, sauf une vie.  Je\nte donnerai le manteau du grand pretre.  Je te donnerai le voile du\nsanctuaire.--_Salome_.\n\n\n\n\nSALOME ANTICIPATES DR. STRAUSS","Ah! tu n'as pas voulu me laisser baiser ta bouche, Iokanaan.

C'etait un jardin plein de\ncolombes et de lis d'argent.  C'etait une tour d'argent ornee de\nboucliers d'ivoire.  Il n'y avait rien au monde d'aussi blanc que ton\ncorps.  Il n'y avait rien au monde d'aussi noir que tes cheveux.  Dans le\nmonde tout entier il n'y avait rien d'aussi rouge que ta bouche.

Il ne faut regarder que l'amour.--_Salome_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE YOUNG KING\n\n\nAll rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination for him,\nand in his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many merchants,\nsome to traffic for amber with the rough fisher-folk of the north seas,\nsome to Egypt to look for that curious green turquoise which is found\nonly in the tombs of kings, and is said to possess magical properties,\nsome to Persia for silken carpets and painted pottery, and others to\nIndia to buy gauze and stained ivory, moonstones and bracelets of jade,\r\nsandal-wood and blue enamel and shawls of fine wool.\n\nBut what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his\ncoronation, the robe of tissued gold, and the ruby-studded crown, and the\nsceptre with its rows and rings of pearls.  Indeed, it was of this that\nhe was thinking to-night, as he lay back on his luxurious couch, watching\nthe great pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth.\nThe designs, which were from the hands of the most famous artists of the\ntime, had been submitted to him many months before, and he had given\norders that the artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out,\nand that the whole world was to be searched for jewels that would be","worthy of their work.  He saw himself in fancy standing at the high altar\nof the cathedral in the fair raiment of a King, and a smile played and\nlingered about his boyish lips, and lit up with a bright lustre his dark\nwoodland eyes.\n\nAfter some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the carved\npenthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly-lit room.  The walls\nwere hung with rich tapestries representing the Triumph of Beauty.  A\nlarge press, inlaid with agate and lapis-lazuli, filled one corner, and\nfacing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels\nof powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets\nof Venetian glass, and a cup of dark-veined onyx.  Pale poppies were\r\nbroidered on the silk coverlet of the bed, as though they had fallen from\nthe tired hands of sleep, and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the\nvelvet canopy, from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang, like\nwhite foam, to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling.  A laughing\nNarcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its head.  On the\ntable stood a flat bowl of amethyst.\n\nOutside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral, looming like a\nbubble over the shadowy houses, and the weary sentinels pacing up and\ndown on the misty terrace by the river.  Far away, in an orchard, a\nnightingale was singing.  A faint perfume of jasmine came through the\r\nopen window.  He brushed his brown curls back from his forehead, and\ntaking up a lute, let his fingers stray across the cords.  His heavy\neyelids drooped, and a strange languor came over him.  Never before had\nhe felt so keenly, or with such exquisite joy, the magic and the mystery\nof beautiful things.\n\nWhen midnight sounded from the clock-tower he touched a bell, and his\npages entered and disrobed him with much ceremony, pouring rose-water\nover his hands, and strewing flowers on his pillow.  A few moments after\nthat they had left the room, he fell asleep.--_The Young King_.\n\n\n\n\nA CORONATION\n\n\nAnd when the Bishop had heard them he knit his brows, and said, 'My son,","I am an old man, and in the winter of my days, and I know that many evil\nthings are done in the wide world.  The fierce robbers come down from the\nmountains, and carry off the little children, and sell them to the Moors.\nThe lions lie in wait for the caravans, and leap upon the camels.  The\nwild boar roots up the corn in the valley, and the foxes gnaw the vines\nupon the hill.  The pirates lay waste the sea-coast and burn the ships of\nthe fishermen, and take their nets from them.  In the salt-marshes live\nthe lepers; they have houses of wattled reeds, and none may come nigh\nthem.  The beggars wander through the cities, and eat their food with the\ndogs.  Canst thou make these things not to be?  Wilt thou take the leper\r\nfor thy bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy board?  Shall the lion do\nthy bidding, and the wild boar obey thee?  Is not He who made misery\nwiser than thou art?  Wherefore I praise thee not for this that thou hast\ndone, but I bid thee ride back to the Palace and make thy face glad, and\nput on the raiment that beseemeth a king, and with the crown of gold I\nwill crown thee, and the sceptre of pearl will I place in thy hand.  And\nas for thy dreams, think no more of them.  The burden of this world is\ntoo great for one man to bear, and the world's sorrow too heavy for one\nheart to suffer.'\n\n'Sayest thou that in this house?' said the young King, and he strode past\r\nthe Bishop, and climbed up the steps of the altar, and stood before the\nimage of Christ.\n\nHe stood before the image of Christ, and on his right hand and on his\nleft were the marvellous vessels of gold, the chalice with the yellow\nwine, and the vial with the holy oil.  He knelt before the image of\nChrist, and the great candles burned brightly by the jewelled shrine, and\nthe smoke of the incense curled in thin blue wreaths through the dome.  He\nbowed his head in prayer, and the priests in their stiff copes crept away\nfrom the altar.\n\nAnd suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside, and in entered\nthe nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes, and shields of polished","steel.  'Where is this dreamer of dreams?' they cried.  'Where is this\nKing who is apparelled like a beggar--this boy who brings shame upon our\nstate?  Surely we will slay him, for he is unworthy to rule over us.'\n\nAnd the young King bowed his head again, and prayed, and when he had\nfinished his prayer he rose up, and turning round he looked at them\nsadly.\n\nAnd lo! through the painted windows came the sunlight streaming upon him,\nand the sun-beams wove round him a tissued robe that was fairer than the\nrobe that had been fashioned for his pleasure.  The dead staff blossomed,\nand bare lilies that were whiter than pearls.  The dry thorn blossomed,\nand bare roses that were redder than rubies.  Whiter than fine pearls\r\nwere the lilies, and their stems were of bright silver.  Redder than male\nrubies were the roses, and their leaves were of beaten gold.\n\nHe stood there in the raiment of a king, and the gates of the jewelled\nshrine flew open, and from the crystal of the many-rayed monstrance shone\na marvellous and mystical light.  He stood there in a king's raiment, and\nthe Glory of God filled the place, and the saints in their carven niches\nseemed to move.  In the fair raiment of a king he stood before them, and\nthe organ pealed out its music, and the trumpeters blew upon their\ntrumpets, and the singing boys sang.\n\nAnd the people fell upon their knees in awe, and the nobles sheathed\r\ntheir swords and did homage, and the Bishop's face grew pale, and his\nhands trembled.  'A greater than I hath crowned thee,' he cried, and he\nknelt before him.\n\nAnd the young King came down from the high altar, and passed home through\nthe midst of the people.  But no man dared look upon his face, for it was\nlike the face of an angel.--_The Young King_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE KING OF SPAIN\n\n\nFrom a window in the palace the sad melancholy King watched them.  Behind\nhim stood his brother, Don Pedro of Aragon, whom he hated, and his\nconfessor, the Grand Inquisitor of Granada, sat by his side.  Sadder even\nthan usual was the King, for as he looked at the Infanta bowing with","childish gravity to the assembling counters, or laughing behind her fan\nat the grim Duchess of Albuquerque who always accompanied her, he thought\nof the young Queen, her mother, who but a short time before--so it seemed\nto him--had come from the gay country of France, and had withered away in\nthe sombre splendour of the Spanish court, dying just six months after\nthe birth of her child, and before she had seen the almonds blossom twice\nin the orchard, or plucked the second year's fruit from the old gnarled\nfig-tree that stood in the centre of the now grass-grown courtyard.  So\ngreat had been his love for her that he had not suffered even the grave\nto hide her from him.  She had been embalmed by a Moorish physician, who\r\nin return for this service had been granted his life, which for heresy\nand suspicion of magical practices had been already forfeited, men said,\nto the Holy Office, and her body was still lying on its tapestried bier\nin the black marble chapel of the Palace, just as the monks had borne her\nin on that windy March day nearly twelve years before.  Once every month\nthe King, wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled lantern in his hand,\nwent in and knelt by her side calling out, '_Mi reina_!  _Mi reina_!' and\nsometimes breaking through the formal etiquette that in Spain governs\nevery separate action of life, and sets limits even to the sorrow of a\nKing, he would clutch at the pale jewelled hands in a wild agony of\r\ngrief, and try to wake by his mad kisses the cold painted face.\n\nTo-day he seemed to see her again, as he had seen her first at the Castle\nof Fontainebleau, when he was but fifteen years of age, and she still\nyounger.  They had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the Papal\nNuncio in the presence of the French King and all the Court, and he had\nreturned to the Escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow\nhair, and the memory of two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand\nas he stepped into his carriage.  Later on had followed the marriage,\nhastily performed at Burgos, a small town on the frontier between the two\ncountries, and the grand public entry into Madrid with the customary","celebration of high mass at the Church of La Atocha, and a more than\nusually solemn _auto-da-fe_, in which nearly three hundred heretics,\namongst whom were many Englishmen, had been delivered over to the secular\narm to be burned.\n\nCertainly he had loved her madly, and to the ruin, many thought, of his\ncountry, then at war with England for the possession of the empire of the\nNew World.  He had hardly ever permitted her to be out of his sight; for\nher, he had forgotten, or seemed to have forgotten, all grave affairs of\nState; and, with that terrible blindness that passion brings upon its\nservants, he had failed to notice that the elaborate ceremonies by which\r\nhe sought to please her did but aggravate the strange malady from which\nshe suffered.  When she died he was, for a time, like one bereft of\nreason.  Indeed, there is no doubt but that he would have formally\nabdicated and retired to the great Trappist monastery at Granada, of\nwhich he was already titular Prior, had he not been afraid to leave the\nlittle Infanta at the mercy of his brother, whose cruelty, even in Spain,\nwas notorious, and who was suspected by many of having caused the Queen's\ndeath by means of a pair of poisoned gloves that he had presented to her\non the occasion of her visiting his castle in Aragon.  Even after the\nexpiration of the three years of public mourning that he had ordained\r\nthroughout his whole dominions by royal edict, he would never suffer his\nministers to speak about any new alliance, and when the Emperor himself\nsent to him, and offered him the hand of the lovely Archduchess of\nBohemia, his niece, in marriage, he bade the ambassadors tell their\nmaster that the King of Spain was already wedded to Sorrow, and that\nthough she was but a barren bride he loved her better than Beauty; an\nanswer that cost his crown the rich provinces of the Netherlands, which\nsoon after, at the Emperor's instigation, revolted against him under the\nleadership of some fanatics of the Reformed Church.--_The Birthday of the\nInfranta_.\n\n\n\n\nA BULL FIGHT","A procession of noble boys, fantastically dressed as _toreadors_, came\nout to meet her, and the young Count of Tierra-Nueva, a wonderfully\nhandsome lad of about fourteen years of age, uncovering his head with all\nthe grace of a born hidalgo and grandee of Spain, led her solemnly in to\na little gilt and ivory chair that was placed on a raised dais above the\narena.  The children grouped themselves all round, fluttering their big\nfans and whispering to each other, and Don Pedro and the Grand Inquisitor\nstood laughing at the entrance.  Even the Duchess--the Camerera-Mayor as\nshe was called--a thin, hard-featured woman with a yellow ruff, did not\nlook quite so bad-tempered as usual, and something like a chill smile\r\nflitted across her wrinkled face and twitched her thin bloodless lips.\n\nIt certainly was a marvellous bull-fight, and much nicer, the Infanta\nthought, than the real bull-fight that she had been brought to see at\nSeville, on the occasion of the visit of the Duke of Parma to her father.\nSome of the boys pranced about on richly-caparisoned hobby-horses\nbrandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands attached\nto them; others went on foot waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull,\nand vaulting lightly over the barrier when he charged them; and as for\nthe bull himself, he was just like a live bull, though he was only made\nof wicker-work and stretched hide, and sometimes insisted on running\r\nround the arena on his hind legs, which no live bull ever dreams of\ndoing.  He made a splendid fight of it too, and the children got so\nexcited that they stood up upon the benches, and waved their lace\nhandkerchiefs and cried out: _Bravo toro_!  _Bravo toro_! just as\nsensibly as if they had been grown-up people.  At last, however, after a\nprolonged combat, during which several of the hobby-horses were gored\nthrough and through, and, their riders dismounted, the young Count of\nTierra-Nueva brought the bull to his knees, and having obtained\npermission from the Infanta to give the _coup de grace_, he plunged his\nwooden sword into the neck of the animal with such violence that the head","came right off, and disclosed the laughing face of little Monsieur de\nLorraine, the son of the French Ambassador at Madrid.\n\nThe arena was then cleared amidst much applause, and the dead\nhobby-horses dragged solemnly away by two Moorish pages in yellow and\nblack liveries, and after a short interlude, during which a French\nposture-master performed upon the tightrope, some Italian puppets\nappeared in the semi-classical tragedy of _Sophonisba_ on the stage of a\nsmall theatre that had been built up for the purpose.  They acted so\nwell, and their gestures were so extremely natural, that at the close of\nthe play the eyes of the Infanta were quite dim with tears.  Indeed some\r\nof the children really cried, and had to be comforted with sweetmeats,\nand the Grand Inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not help\nsaying to Don Pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made\nsimply out of wood and coloured wax, and worked mechanically by wires,\nshould be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunes.--_The\nBirthday of the Infanta_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE THRONE ROOM\n\n\nIt was a throne-room, used for the reception of foreign ambassadors, when\nthe King, which of late had not been often, consented to give them a\npersonal audience; the same room in which, many years before, envoys had\nappeared from England to make arrangements for the marriage of their\r\nQueen, then one of the Catholic sovereigns of Europe, with the Emperor's\neldest son.  The hangings were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt\nchandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the\nblack and white ceiling.  Underneath a great canopy of gold cloth, on\nwhich the lions and towers of Castile were broidered in seed pearls,\nstood the throne itself, covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded\nwith silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls.  On\nthe second step of the throne was placed the kneeling-stool of the\nInfanta, with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue, and below that\nagain, and beyond the limit of the canopy, stood the chair for the Papal","Nuncio, who alone had the right to be seated in the King's presence on\nthe occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose Cardinal's hat, with its\ntangled scarlet tassels, lay on a purple _tabouret_ in front.  On the\nwall, facing the throne, hung a life-sized portrait of Charles V. in\nhunting dress, with a great mastiff by his side, and a picture of Philip\nII. receiving the homage of the Netherlands occupied the centre of the\nother wall.  Between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet, inlaid with\nplates of ivory, on which the figures from Holbein's Dance of Death had\nbeen graved--by the hand, some said, of that famous master himself.\n\nBut the little Dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence.  He would\r\nnot have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy, nor one white\npetal of his rose for the throne itself.  What he wanted was to see the\nInfanta before she went down to the pavilion, and to ask her to come away\nwith him when he had finished his dance.  Here, in the Palace, the air\nwas close and heavy, but in the forest the wind blew free, and the\nsunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside.\nThere were flowers, too, in the forest, not so splendid, perhaps, as the\nflowers in the garden, but more sweetly scented for all that; hyacinths\nin early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool glens, and\ngrassy knolls; yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round the\r\ngnarled roots of the oak-trees; bright celandine, and blue speedwell, and\nirises lilac and gold.  There were grey catkins on the hazels, and the\nfoxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled bee-haunted cells.  The\nchestnut had its spires of white stars, and the hawthorn its pallid moons\nof beauty.  Yes: surely she would come if he could only find her!  She\nwould come with him to the fair forest, and all day long he would dance\nfor her delight.  A smile lit up his eyes at the thought, and he passed\ninto the next room.\n\nOf all the rooms this was the brightest and the most beautiful.  The\nwalls were covered with a pink-flowered Lucca damask, patterned with","birds and dotted with dainty blossoms of silver; the furniture was of\nmassive silver, festooned with florid wreaths, and swinging Cupids; in\nfront of the two large fire-places stood great screens broidered with\nparrots and peacocks, and the floor, which was of sea-green onyx, seemed\nto stretch far away into the distance.  Nor was he alone.  Standing under\nthe shadow of the doorway, at the extreme end of the room, he saw a\nlittle figure watching him.  His heart trembled, a cry of joy broke from\nhis lips, and he moved out into the sunlight.  As he did so, the figure\nmoved out also, and he saw it plainly.--_The Birthday of the Infanta_.\n\n\n\n\nA PROTECTED COUNTRY\n\n\n'The kings of each city levied tolls on us, but would not suffer us to\r\nenter their gates.  They threw us bread over the walls, little\nmaize-cakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled with dates.  For\nevery hundred baskets we gave them a bead of amber.\n\n'When the dwellers in the villages saw us coming, they poisoned the wells\nand fled to the hill-summits.  We fought with the Magadae who are born\nold, and grow younger and younger every year, and die when they are\nlittle children; and with the Laktroi who say that they are the sons of\ntigers, and paint themselves yellow and black; and with the Aurantes who\nbury their dead on the tops of trees, and themselves live in dark caverns\nlest the Sun, who is their god, should slay them; and with the Krimnians\r\nwho worship a crocodile, and give it earrings of green glass, and feed it\nwith butter and fresh fowls; and with the Agazonbae, who are dog-faced;\nand with the Sibans, who have horses' feet, and run more swiftly than\nhorses.  A third of our company died in battle, and a third died of want.\nThe rest murmured against me, and said that I had brought them an evil\nfortune.  I took a horned adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me.\nWhen they saw that I did not sicken they grew afraid.\n\n'In the fourth month we reached the city of Illel.  It was night-time\nwhen we came to the grove that is outside the walls, and the air was\nsultry, for the Moon was travelling in Scorpion.  We took the ripe","pomegranates from the trees, and brake them, and drank their sweet\njuices.  Then we lay down on our carpets, and waited for the dawn.\n\n'And at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city.  It was wrought\nout of red bronze, and carved with sea-dragons and dragons that have\nwings.  The guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our\nbusiness.  The interpreter of the caravan answered that we had come from\nthe island of Syria with much merchandise.  They took hostages, and told\nus that they would open the gate to us at noon, and bade us tarry till\nthen.\n\n'When it was noon they opened the gate, and as we entered in the people\ncame crowding out of the houses to look at us, and a crier went round the\r\ncity crying through a shell.  We stood in the market-place, and the\nnegroes uncorded the bales of figured cloths and opened the carved chests\nof sycamore.  And when they had ended their task, the merchants set forth\ntheir strange wares, the waxed linen from Egypt and the painted linen\nfrom the country of the Ethiops, the purple sponges from Tyre and the\nblue hangings from Sidon, the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of\nglass and the curious vessels of burnt clay.  From the roof of a house a\ncompany of women watched us.  One of them wore a mask of gilded leather.\n\n'And on the first day the priests came and bartered with us, and on the\nsecond day came the nobles, and on the third day came the craftsmen and\r\nthe slaves.  And this is their custom with all merchants as long as they\ntarry in the city.\n\n'And we tarried for a moon, and when the moon was waning, I wearied and\nwandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of\nits god.  The priests in their yellow robes moved silently through the\ngreen trees, and on a pavement of black marble stood the rose-red house\nin which the god had his dwelling.  Its doors were of powdered lacquer,\nand bulls and peacocks were wrought on them in raised and polished gold.\nThe tilted roof was of sea-green porcelain, and the jutting eaves were\nfestooned with little bells.  When the white doves flew past, they struck","the bells with their wings and made them tinkle.\n\n'In front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with veined onyx.\nI lay down beside it, and with my pale fingers I touched the broad\nleaves.  One of the priests came towards me and stood behind me.  He had\nsandals on his feet, one of soft serpent-skin and the other of birds'\nplumage.  On his head was a mitre of black felt decorated with silver\ncrescents.  Seven yellows were woven into his robe, and his frizzed hair\nwas stained with antimony.\n\n'After a little while he spake to me, and asked me my desire.\n\n'I told him that my desire was to see the god.'--_The Fisherman and His\nSoul_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLACKMAILING OF THE EMPEROR\r\n'As soon as the man was dead the Emperor turned to me, and when he had\nwiped away the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin of purfled\nand purple silk, he said to me, \"Art thou a prophet, that I may not harm\nthee, or the son of a prophet, that I can do thee no hurt?  I pray thee\nleave my city to-night, for while thou art in it I am no longer its\nlord.\"\n\n'And I answered him, \"I will go for half of thy treasure.  Give me half\nof thy treasure, and I will go away.\"\n\n'He took me by the hand, and led me out into the garden.  When the\ncaptain of the guard saw me, he wondered.  When the eunuchs saw me, their\nknees shook and they fell upon the ground in fear.\r\n'There is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry,\nand a brass-sealed ceiling hung with lamps.  The Emperor touched one of\nthe walls and it opened, and we passed down a corridor that was lit with\nmany torches.  In niches upon each side stood great wine-jars filled to\nthe brim with silver pieces.  When we reached the centre of the corridor\nthe Emperor spake the word that may not be spoken, and a granite door\nswung back on a secret spring, and he put his hands before his face lest\nhis eyes should be dazzled.\n\n'Thou couldst not believe how marvellous a place it was.  There were huge\ntortoise-shells full of pearls, and hollowed moonstones of great size","piled up with red rubies.  The gold was stored in coffers of elephant-\nhide, and the gold-dust in leather bottles.  There were opals and\nsapphires, the former in cups of crystal, and the latter in cups of jade.\nRound green emeralds were ranged in order upon thin plates of ivory, and\nin one corner were silk bags filled, some with turquoise-stones, and\nothers with beryls.  The ivory horns were heaped with purple amethysts,\nand the horns of brass with chalcedonies and sards.  The pillars, which\nwere of cedar, were hung with strings of yellow lynx-stones.  In the flat\noval shields there were carbuncles, both wine-coloured and coloured like\ngrass.  And yet I have told thee but a tithe of what was there.\r\n'And when the Emperor had taken away his hands from before his face he\nsaid to me: \"This is my house of treasure, and half that is in it is\nthine, even as I promised to thee.  And I will give thee camels and camel\ndrivers, and they shall do thy bidding and take thy share of the treasure\nto whatever part of the world thou desirest to go.  And the thing shall\nbe done to-night, for I would not that the Sun, who is my father, should\nsee that there is in my city a man whom I cannot slay.\"\n\n'But I answered him, \"The gold that is here is thine, and the silver also\nis thine, and thine are the precious jewels and the things of price.  As\nfor me, I have no need of these.  Nor shall I take aught from thee but\r\nthat little ring that thou wearest on the finger of thy hand.\"\n\n'And the Emperor frowned.  \"It is but a ring of lead,\" he cried, \"nor has\nit any value.  Therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my\ncity.\"\n\n'\"Nay,\" I answered, \"but I will take nought but that leaden ring, for I\nknow what is written within it, and for what purpose.\"\n\n'And the Emperor trembled, and besought me and said, \"Take all the\ntreasure and go from my city.  The half that is mine shall be thine\nalso.\"\n\n'And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a cave\nthat is but a day's journey from this place have, I hidden the Ring of\nRiches.  It is but a day's journey from this place, and it waits for thy","coming.  He who has this Ring is richer than all the kings of the world.\nCome therefore and take it, and the world's riches shall be thine.'--_The\nFisherman and His Soul_.\n\n\n\n\nCOVENT GARDEN\n\n\nWhere he went he hardly knew.  He had a dim memory of wandering through a\nlabyrinth of sordid houses, of being lost in a giant web of sombre\nstreets, and it was bright dawn when he found himself at last in\nPiccadilly Circus.  As he strolled home towards Belgrave Square, he met\nthe great waggons on their way to Covent Garden.  The white-smocked\ncarters, with their pleasant sunburnt faces and coarse curly hair, strode\nsturdily on, cracking their whips, and calling out now and then to each\r\nother; on the back of a huge grey horse, the leader of a jangling team,\nsat a chubby boy, with a bunch of primroses in his battered hat, keeping\ntight hold of the mane with his little hands, and laughing; and the great\npiles of vegetables looked like masses of jade against the morning sky,\nlike masses of green jade against the pink petals of some marvellous\nrose.  Lord Arthur felt curiously affected, he could not tell why.  There\nwas something in the dawn's delicate loveliness that seemed to him\ninexpressibly pathetic, and he thought of all the days that break in\nbeauty, and that set in storm.  These rustics, too, with their rough,\ngood-humoured voices, and their nonchalant ways, what a strange London\r\nthey saw!  A London free from the sin of night and the smoke of day, a\npallid, ghost-like city, a desolate town of tombs!  He wondered what they\nthought of it, and whether they knew anything of its splendour and its\nshame, of its fierce, fiery-coloured joys, and its horrible hunger, of\nall it makes and mars from morn to eve.  Probably it was to them merely a\nmart where they brought their fruits to sell, and where they tarried for\na few hours at most, leaving the streets still silent, the houses still\nasleep.  It gave him pleasure to watch them as they went by.  Rude as\nthey were, with their heavy, hob-nailed shoes, and their awkward gait,","they brought a little of a ready with them.  He felt that they had lived\nwith Nature, and that she had taught them peace.  He envied them all that\nthey did not know.\n\nBy the time he had reached Belgrave Square the sky was a faint blue, and\nthe birds were beginning to twitter in the gardens.--_Lord Arthur\nSavile's Crime_.\n\n\n\n\nA LETTER FROM MISS JANE PERCY TO HER AUNT\n\n\nTHE DEANERY, CHICHESTER,\n\n27_th May_.\n\nMy Dearest Aunt,\n\nThank you so much for the flannel for the Dorcas Society, and also for\nthe gingham.  I quite agree with you that it is nonsense their wanting to\nwear pretty things, but everybody is so Radical and irreligious nowadays,\nthat it is difficult to make them see that they should not try and dress\r\nlike the upper classes.  I am sure I don't know what we are coming to.  As\npapa has often said in his sermons, we live in an age of unbelief.\n\nWe have had great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papa last\nThursday.  It arrived in a wooden box from London, carriage paid, and\npapa feels it must have been sent by some one who had read his remarkable\nsermon, 'Is Licence Liberty?' for on the top of the clock was a figure of\na woman, with what papa said was the cap of Liberty on her head.  I\ndidn't think it very becoming myself, but papa said it was historical, so\nI suppose it is all right.  Parker unpacked it, and papa put it on the\nmantelpiece in the library, and we were all sitting there on Friday\r\nmorning, when just as the clock struck twelve, we heard a whirring noise,\na little puff of smoke came from the pedestal of the figure, and the\ngoddess of Liberty fell off, and broke her nose on the fender!  Maria was\nquite alarmed, but it looked so ridiculous, that James and I went off\ninto fits of laughter, and even papa was amused.  When we examined it, we\nfound it was a sort of alarum clock, and that, if you set it to a\nparticular hour, and put some gunpowder and a cap under a little hammer,\nit went off whenever you wanted.  Papa said it must not remain in the\nlibrary, as it made a noise, so Reggie carried it away to the schoolroom,\nand does nothing but have small explosions all day long.  Do you think","Arthur would like one for a wedding present?  I suppose they are quite\nfashionable in London.  Papa says they should do a great deal of good, as\nthey show that Liberty can't last, but must fall down.  Papa says Liberty\nwas invented at the time of the French Revolution.  How awful it seems!\n\nI have now to go to the Dorcas, where I will read them your most\ninstructive letter.  How true, dear aunt, your idea is, that in their\nrank of life they should wear what is unbecoming.  I must say it is\nabsurd, their anxiety about dress, when there are so many more important\nthings in this world, and in the next.  I am so glad your flowered poplin\nturned out so well, and that your lace was not torn.  I am wearing my\r\nyellow satin, that you so kindly gave me, at the Bishop's on Wednesday,\nand think it will look all right.  Would you have bows or not?  Jennings\nsays that every one wears bows now, and that the underskirt should be\nfrilled.  Reggie has just had another explosion, and papa has ordered the\nclock to be sent to the stables.  I don't think papa likes it so much as\nhe did at first, though he is very flattered at being sent such a pretty\nand ingenious toy.  It shows that people read his sermons, and profit by\nthem.\n\nPapa sends his love, in which James, and Reggie, and Maria all unite,\nand, hoping that Uncle Cecil's gout is better, believe me, dear aunt,\r\never your affectionate niece,\n\nJANE PERCY.\n\nPS.--Do tell me about the bows.  Jennings insists they are the\nfashion.--_Lord Arthur Savile's Crime_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TRIUMPH OF AMERICAN 'HUMOR'\n\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed.  For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the light-\nhearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves before\nthey retired to rest, but at a quarter past eleven all was still, and, as\nmidnight sounded, he sallied forth.  The owl beat against the window\npanes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind wandered\nmoaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family slept","unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he could\nhear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States.  He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his murdered\nwife were blazoned in azure and gold.  On and on he glided, like an evil\nshadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.  Once he\nthought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only the baying\nof a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange sixteenth-\ncentury curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger in the\r\nmidnight air.  Finally he reached the corner of the passage that led to\nluckless Washington's room.  For a moment he paused there, the wind\nblowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into grotesque\nand fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's shroud.  Then\nthe clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was come.  He chuckled\nto himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had he done so, than,\nwith a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid his blanched face in\nhis long, bony hands.  Right in front of him was standing a horrible\nspectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous as a madman's dream!\nIts head was bald and burnished; its face round, and fat, and white; and\r\nhideous laughter seemed to have writhed its features into an eternal\ngrin.  From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet light, the mouth was a wide\nwell of fire, and a hideous garment, like to his own, swathed with its\nsilent snows the Titan form.  On its breast was a placard with strange\nwriting in antique characters, some scroll of shame it seemed, some\nrecord of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime, and, with its right\nhand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the","corridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's jack-\nboots, where it was found in the morning by the butler.  Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small pallet-\nbed, and hid his face under the clothes.  After a time, however, the\nbrave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to go and\nspeak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight.  Accordingly, just\nas the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards the\nspot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling that,\nafter all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid of his\nnew friend, he might safely grapple with the twins.  On reaching the\r\nspot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze.  Something had evidently\nhappened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from its hollow\neyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it was leaning\nup against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable attitude.  He rushed\nforward and seized it in his arms, when, to his horror, the head slipped\noff and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a recumbent posture, and he\nfound himself clasping a white dimity bed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush,\na kitchen cleaver, and a hollow turnip lying at his feet!--_The\nCanterville Ghost_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GARDEN OF DEATH\n\n\n'Far away beyond the pine-woods,' he answered, in a low dreamy voice,\r\n'there is a little garden.  There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long.  All night long he sings, and the cold, crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.'\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n'You mean the Garden of Death,' she whispered.\n\n'Yes, Death.  Death must be so beautiful.  To lie in the soft brown\nearth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence.\nTo have no yesterday, and no to-morrow.  To forget time, to forgive life,\nto be at peace.  You can help me.  You can open for me the portals of","Death's house, for Love is always with you, and Love is stronger than\nDeath is.'\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence.  She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the Ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of the\nwind.\n\n'Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?'\n\n'Oh, often,' cried the little girl, looking up; 'I know it quite well.  It\nis painted in curious black letters, and it is difficult to read.  There\nare only six lines:\n\n   When a golden girl can win\n   Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n   When the barren almond bears,\n   And a little child gives away its tears,\r\nThen shall all the house be still\n   And peace come to Canterville.\n\nBut I don't know what they mean.'\n\n'They mean,' he said sadly, 'that you must weep for me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle, the\nAngel of Death will have mercy on me.  You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.'\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the Ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as\nhe looked down at her bowed golden head.  Suddenly she stood up, very\r\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes.  'I am not afraid,' she said\nfirmly, 'and I will ask the Angel to have mercy on you.'\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it.  His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as he\nled her across the dusky room.  On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen.  They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back.  'Go back! little Virginia,'\nthey cried, 'go back!' but the Ghost clutched her hand more tightly, and\nshe shut her eyes against them.  Horrible animals with lizard tails, and","goggle eyes, blinked at her from the carven chimney-piece, and murmured\n'Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,' but the\nGhost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen.  When they\nreached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she could\nnot understand.  She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly fading away\nlike a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her.  A bitter cold\nwind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her dress.\n'Quick, quick,' cried the Ghost, 'or it will be too late,' and, in a\nmoment, the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry Chamber\nwas empty.--_The Canterville Ghost_.\n\n\n\n\nAN ETON KIT-CAT\r\n\"Well,\" said Erskine, lighting a cigarette, \"I must begin by telling you\nabout Cyril Graham himself.  He and I were at the same house at Eton.  I\nwas a year or two older than he was, but we were immense friends, and did\nall our work and all our play together.  There was, of course, a good\ndeal more play than work, but I cannot say that I am sorry for that.  It\nis always an advantage not to have received a sound commercial education,\nand what I learned in the playing fields at Eton has been quite as useful\nto me as anything I was taught at Cambridge.  I should tell you that\nCyril's father and mother were both dead.  They had been drowned in a\nhorrible yachting accident off the Isle of Wight.  His father had been in\r\nthe diplomatic service, and had married a daughter, the only daughter, in\nfact, of old Lord Crediton, who became Cyril's guardian after the death\nof his parents.  I don't think that Lord Crediton cared very much for\nCyril.  He had never really forgiven his daughter for marrying a man who\nhad not a title.  He was an extraordinary old aristocrat, who swore like\na costermonger, and had the manners of a farmer.  I remember seeing him\nonce on Speech-day.  He growled at me, gave me a sovereign, and told me\nnot to grow up 'a damned Radical' like my father.  Cyril had very little\naffection for him, and was only too glad to spend most of his holidays","with us in Scotland.  They never really got on together at all.  Cyril\nthought him a bear, and he thought Cyril effeminate.  He was effeminate,\nI suppose, in some things, though he was a very good rider and a capital\nfencer.  In fact he got the foils before he left Eton.  But he was very\nlanguid in his manner, and not a little vain of his good looks, and had a\nstrong objection to football.  The two things that really gave him\npleasure were poetry and acting.  At Eton he was always dressing up and\nreciting Shakespeare, and when he went up to Trinity he became a member\nof the A.D.C. his first term.  I remember I was always very jealous of\nhis acting.  I was absurdly devoted to him; I suppose because we were so\r\ndifferent in some things.  I was a rather awkward, weakly lad, with huge\nfeet, and horribly freckled.  Freckles run in Scotch families just as\ngout does in English families.  Cyril used to say that of the two he\npreferred the gout; but he always set an absurdly high value on personal\nappearance, and once read a paper before our debating society to prove\nthat it was better to be good-looking than to be good.  He certainly was\nwonderfully handsome.  People who did not like him, Philistines and\ncollege tutors, and young men reading for the Church, used to say that he\nwas merely pretty; but there was a great deal more in his face than mere\nprettiness.  I think he was the most splendid creature I ever saw, and\r\nnothing could exceed the grace of his movements, the charm of his manner.\nHe fascinated everybody who was worth fascinating, and a great many\npeople who were not.  He was often wilful and petulant, and I used to\nthink him dreadfully insincere.  It was due, I think, chiefly to his\ninordinate desire to please.  Poor Cyril!  I told him once that he was\ncontented with very cheap triumphs, but he only laughed.  He was horribly\nspoiled.  All charming people, I fancy, are spoiled.  It is the secret of\ntheir attraction.\n\n\"However, I must tell you about Cyril's acting.  You know that no\nactresses are allowed to play at the A.D.C.  At least they were not in my","time.  I don't know how it is now.  Well, of course, Cyril was always\ncast for the girls' parts, and when _As You Like It_ was produced he\nplayed Rosalind.  It was a marvellous performance.  In fact, Cyril Graham\nwas the only perfect Rosalind I have ever seen.  It would be impossible\nto describe to you the beauty, the delicacy, the refinement of the whole\nthing.  It made an immense sensation, and the horrid little theatre, as\nit was then, was crowded every night.  Even when I read the play now I\ncan't help thinking of Cyril.  It might have been written for him.  The\nnext term he took his degree, and came to London to read for the\ndiplomatic.  But he never did any work.  He spent his days in reading\r\nShakespeare's Sonnets, and his evenings at the theatre.  He was, of\ncourse, wild to go on the stage.  It was all that I and Lord Crediton\ncould do to prevent him.  Perhaps if he had gone on the stage he would be\nalive now.  It is always a silly thing to give advice, but to give good\nadvice is absolutely fatal.  I hope you will never fall into that error.\nIf you do, you will be sorry for it.\"--_The Portrait of Mr. W. H_.\n\n\n\n\nMRS.

Believe\nwhat you choose about me.  I am not worth a moment's sorrow.  But don't\nspoil your beautiful young life on my account!  You don't know what may\nbe in store for you, unless you leave this house at once.  You don't know\nwhat it is to fall into the pit, to be despised, mocked, abandoned,\nsneered at--to be an outcast! to find the door shut against one, to have\nto creep in by hideous byways, afraid every moment lest the mask should\nbe stripped from one's face, and all the while to hear the laughter, the\nhorrible laughter of the world, a thing more tragic than all the tears","the world has ever shed.

If he abandoned you, your place is with your\nchild.--_Lady Windermere's Fan_.\n\n\n\n\nMOTHERHOOD MORE THAN MARRIAGE\r\nMen don't understand what mothers are.  I am no different from other\nwomen except in the wrong done me and the wrong I did, and my very heavy\npunishments and great disgrace.  And yet, to bear you I had to look on\ndeath.  To nurture you I had to wrestle with it.  Death fought with me\nfor you.  All women have to fight with death to keep their children.\nDeath, being childless, wants our children from us.  Gerald, when you\nwere naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave you food.  Night\nand day all that long winter I tended you.  No office is too mean, no\ncare too lowly for the thing we women love--and oh! how _I_ loved _you_.\nNot Hannah, Samuel more.  And you needed love, for you were weakly, and","only love could have kept you alive.  Only love can keep any one alive.\nAnd boys are careless often and without thinking give pain, and we always\nfancy that when they come to man's estate and know us better they will\nrepay us.  But it is not so.  The world draws them from our side, and\nthey make friends with whom they are happier than they are with us, and\nhave amusements from which we are barred, and interests that are not\nours: and they are unjust to us often, for when they find life bitter\nthey blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste its\nsweetness with them . . . You made many friends and went into their\nhouses and were glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to\r\nfollow, but stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat\nin darkness.  What should I have done in honest households?  My past was\never with me. . . . And you thought I didn't care for the pleasant things\nof life.  I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them,\nfeeling I had no right.  You thought I was happier working amongst the\npoor.  That was my mission, you imagined.  It was not, but where else was\nI to go?  The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is\npure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the\nkiss of sin.  It was you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the\r\nlove you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . .\nAnd you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and in\nChurch duties.  But where else could I turn?  God's house is the only\nhouse where sinners are made welcome, and you were always in my heart,\nGerald, too much in my heart.  For, though day after day, at morn or\nevensong, I have knelt in God's house, I have never repented of my sin.\nHow could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit!  Even now\nthat you are bitter to me I cannot repent.  I do not.  You are more to me\nthan innocence.  I would rather be your mother--oh! much rather!--than\nhave been always pure . . . Oh, don't you see? don't you understand?  It","is my dishonour that has made you so dear to me.  It is my disgrace that\nhas bound you so closely to me.  It is the price I paid for you--the\nprice of soul and body--that makes me love you as I do.  Oh, don't ask me\nto do this horrible thing.  Child of my shame, be still the child of my\nshame!--_A Woman of No Importance_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DAMNABLE IDEAL\n\n\nWhy can't you women love us, faults and all?  Why do you place us on\nmonstrous pedestals?  We have all feet of clay, women as well as men; but\nwhen we men love women, we love them knowing their weaknesses, their\nfollies, their imperfections, love them all the more, it may be, for that\nreason.  It is not the perfect, but the imperfect, who have need of love.\r\nIt is when we are wounded by our own hands, or by the hands of others,\nthat love should come to cure us--else what use is love at all?  All\nsins, except a sin against itself, Love should forgive.  All lives, save\nloveless lives, true Love should pardon.  A man's love is like that.  It\nis wider, larger, more human than a woman's.  Women think that they are\nmaking ideals of men.  What they are making of us are false idols merely.\nYou made your false idol of me, and I had not the courage to come down,\nshow you my wounds, tell you my weaknesses.  I was afraid that I might\nlose your love, as I have lost it now.  And so, last night you ruined my\nlife for me--yes, ruined it!  What this woman asked of me was nothing\r\ncompared to what she offered to me.  She offered security, peace,\nstability.  The sin of my youth, that I had thought was buried, rose up\nin front of me, hideous, horrible, with its hands at my throat.  I could\nhave killed it for ever, sent it back into its tomb, destroyed its\nrecord, burned the one witness against me.  You prevented me.  No one but\nyou, you know it.  And now what is there before me but public disgrace,\nruin, terrible shame, the mockery of the world, a lonely dishonoured\nlife, a lonely dishonoured death, it may be, some day?  Let women make no\nmore ideals of men! let them not put them on alters and bow before them,\nor they may ruin other lives as completely as you--you whom I have so","wildly loved--have ruined mine!--_An Ideal Husband_.\n\n\n\n\nFROM A REJECTED PRIZE-ESSAY\n\n\nNations may not have missions but they certainly have functions.  And the\nfunction of ancient Italy was not merely to give us what is statical in\nour institutions and rational in our law, but to blend into one elemental\ncreed the spiritual aspirations of Aryan and of Semite.  Italy was not a\npioneer in intellectual progress, nor a motive power in the evolution of\nthought.  The owl of the goddess of Wisdom traversed over the whole land\nand found nowhere a resting-place.  The dove, which is the bird of\nChrist, flew straight to the city of Rome and the new reign began.  It\r\nwas the fashion of early Italian painters to represent in mediaeval\ncostume the soldiers who watched over the tomb of Christ, and this, which\nwas the result of the frank anachronism of all true art, may serve to us\nas an allegory.  For it was in vain that the Middle Ages strove to guard\nthe buried spirit of progress.  When the dawn of the Greek spirit arose,\nthe sepulchre was empty, the grave-clothes laid aside.  Humanity had\nrisen from the dead.\n\nThe study of Greek, it has been well said, implies the birth of\ncriticism, comparison and research.  At the opening of that education of\nmodern by ancient thought which we call the Renaissance, it was the words\nof Aristotle which sent Columbus sailing to the New World, while a\r\nfragment of Pythagorean astronomy set Copernicus thinking on that train\nof reasoning which has revolutionised the whole position of our planet in\nthe universe.  Then it was seen that the only meaning of progress is a\nreturn to Greek modes of thought.  The monkish hymns which obscured the\npages of Greek manuscripts were blotted out, the splendours of a new\nmethod were unfolded to the world, and out of the melancholy sea of\nmediaevalism rose the free spirit of man in all that splendour of glad\nadolescence, when the bodily powers seem quickened by a new vitality,\nwhen the eye sees more clearly than its wont and the mind apprehends what\nwas beforetime hidden from it.  To herald the opening of the sixteenth","century, from the little Venetian printing press came forth all the great\nauthors of antiquity, each bearing on the title-page the words [Greek\ntext]; words which may serve to remind us with what wondrous prescience\nPolybius saw the world's fate when he foretold the material sovereignty\nof Roman institutions and exemplified in himself the intellectual empire\nof Greece.\n\nThe course of the study of the spirit of historical criticism has not\nbeen a profitless investigation into modes and forms of thought now\nantiquated and of no account.  The only spirit which is entirely removed\nfrom us is the mediaeval; the Greek spirit is essentially modern.  The\nintroduction of the comparative method of research which has forced\r\nhistory to disclose its secrets belongs in a measure to us.  Ours, too,\nis a more scientific knowledge of philology and the method of survival.\nNor did the ancients know anything of the doctrine of averages or of\ncrucial instances, both of which methods have proved of such importance\nin modern criticism, the one adding a most important proof of the\nstatical elements of history, and exemplifying the influences of all\nphysical surroundings on the life of man; the other, as in the single\ninstance of the Moulin Quignon skull, serving to create a whole new\nscience of prehistoric archaeology and to bring us back to a time when\nman was coeval with the stone age, the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros.\r\nBut, except these, we have added no new canon or method to the science of\nhistorical criticism.  Across the drear waste of a thousand years the\nGreek and the modern spirit join hands.\n\nIn the torch race which the Greek boys ran from the Cerameician field of\ndeath to the home of the goddess of Wisdom, not merely he who first\nreached the goal but he also who first started with the torch aflame\nreceived a prize.  In the Lampadephoria of civilisation and free thought\nlet us not forget to render due meed of honour to those who first lit\nthat sacred flame, the increasing splendour of which lights our footsteps\nto the far-off divine event of the attainment of perfect truth.--_The","Rise of Historical Criticism_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE POSSIBILITIES OF THE USEFUL\n\n\nThere are two kinds of men in the world, two great creeds, two different\nforms of natures: men to whom the end of life is action, and men to whom\nthe end of life is thought.  As regards the latter, who seek for\nexperience itself and not for the fruits of experience, who must burn\nalways with one of the passions of this fiery-coloured world, who find\nlife interesting not for its secret but for its situations, for its\npulsations and not for its purpose; the passion for beauty engendered by\nthe decorative arts will be to them more satisfying than any political or\nreligious enthusiasm, any enthusiasm for humanity, any ecstasy or sorrow\r\nfor love.  For art comes to one professing primarily to give nothing but\nthe highest quality to one's moments, and for those moments' sake.  So\nfar for those to whom the end of life is thought.  As regards the others,\nwho hold that life is inseparable from labour, to them should this\nmovement be specially dear: for, if our days are barren without industry,\nindustry without art is barbarism.\n\nHewers of wood and drawers of water there must be always indeed among us.\nOur modern machinery has not much lightened the labour of man after all:\nbut at least let the pitcher that stands by the well be beautiful and\nsurely the labour of the day will be lightened: let the wood be made\r\nreceptive of some lovely form, some gracious design, and there will come\nno longer discontent but joy to the toiler.  For what is decoration but\nthe worker's expression of joy in his work?  And not joy merely--that is\na great thing yet not enough--but that opportunity of expressing his own\nindividuality which, as it is the essence of all life, is the source of\nall art.  'I have tried,' I remember William Morris saying to me once, 'I\nhave tried to make each of my workers an artist, and when I say an artist\nI mean a man.'  For the worker then, handicraftsman of whatever kind he\nis, art is no longer to be a purple robe woven by a slave and thrown over","the whitened body of a leprous king to hide and to adorn the sin of his\nluxury, but rather the beautiful and noble expression of a life that has\nin it something beautiful and noble.--_The English Renaissance of Art_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ARTIST\n\n\nONE evening there came into his soul the desire to fashion an image of\n_The Pleasure that abideth for a Moment_.  And he went forth into the\nworld to look for bronze.  For he could think only in bronze.\n\nBut all the bronze of the whole world had disappeared, nor anywhere in\nthe whole world was there any bronze to be found, save only the bronze of\nthe image of _The Sorrow that endureth for Ever_.\n\nNow this image he had himself, and with his own hands, fashioned, and had\r\nset it on the tomb of the one thing he had loved in life.  On the tomb of\nthe dead thing he had most loved had he set this image of his own\nfashioning, that it might serve as a sign of the love of man that dieth\nnot, and a symbol of the sorrow of man that endureth for ever.  And in\nthe whole world there was no other bronze save the bronze of this image.\n\nAnd he took the image he had fashioned, and set it in a great furnace,\nand gave it to the fire.\n\nAnd out of the bronze of the image of _The Sorrow that endureth for Ever_\nhe fashioned an image of _The Pleasure that abideth for a Moment_.--_Poems\nin Prose_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOER OF GOOD\n\n\nIt was night-time and He was alone.\r\nAnd He saw afar-off the walls of a round city and went towards the city.\n\nAnd when He came near He heard within the city the tread of the feet of\njoy, and the laughter of the mouth of gladness and the loud noise of many\nlutes.  And He knocked at the gate and certain of the gate-keepers opened\nto Him.\n\nAnd He beheld a house that was of marble and had fair pillars of marble\nbefore it.  The pillars were hung with garlands, and within and without\nthere were torches of cedar.  And He entered the house.\n\nAnd when He had passed through the hall of chalcedony and the hall of\njasper, and reached the long hall of feasting, He saw lying on a couch of\nsea-purple one whose hair was crowned with red roses and whose lips were","red with wine.\n\nAnd He went behind him and touched him on the shoulder and said to him,\n'Why do you live like this?'\n\nAnd the young man turned round and recognised Him, and made answer and\nsaid, 'But I was a leper once, and you healed me.  How else should I\nlive?'\n\nAnd He passed out of the house and went again into the street.\n\nAnd after a little while He saw one whose face and raiment were painted\nand whose feet were shod with pearls.  And behind her came, slowly as a\nhunter, a young man who wore a cloak of two colours.  Now the face of the\nwoman was as the fair face of an idol, and the eyes of the young man were\nbright with lust.\n\nAnd He followed swiftly and touched the hand of the young man and said to\r\nhim, 'Why do you look at this woman and in such wise?'\n\nAnd the young man turned round and recognised Him and said, 'But I was\nblind once, and you gave me sight.  At what else should I look?'\n\nAnd He ran forward and touched the painted raiment of the woman and said\nto her, 'Is there no other way in which to walk save the way of sin?'\n\nAnd the woman turned round and recognised Him, and laughed and said, 'But\nyou forgave me my sins, and the way is a pleasant way.'\n\nAnd He passed out of the city.\n\nAnd when He had passed out of the city He saw seated by the roadside a\nyoung man who was weeping.\n\nAnd He went towards him and touched the long locks of his hair and said\r\nto him, 'Why are you weeping?'\n\nAnd the young man looked up and recognised Him and made answer, 'But I\nwas dead once, and you raised me from the dead.  What else should I do\nbut weep?'--_Poems in Prose_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DISCIPLE\n\n\nWhen Narcissus died the pool of his pleasure changed from a cup of sweet\nwaters into a cup of salt tears, and the Oreads came weeping through the\nwoodland that they might sing to the pool and give it comfort.\n\nAnd when they saw that the pool had changed from a cup of sweet waters\ninto a cup of salt tears, they loosened the green tresses of their hair\nand cried to the pool and said, 'We do not wonder that you should mourn\nin this manner for Narcissus, so beautiful was he.'","'But was Narcissus beautiful?' said the pool.\n\n'Who should know that better than you?' answered the Oreads.  'Us did he\never pass by, but you he sought for, and would lie on your banks and look\ndown at you, and in the mirror of your waters he would mirror his own\nbeauty.'\n\nAnd the pool answered, 'But I loved Narcissus because, as he lay on my\nbanks and looked down at me, in the mirror of his eyes I saw ever my own\nbeauty mirrored.'--_Poems in Prose_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MASTER\n\n\nNow when the darkness came over the earth Joseph of Arimathea, having\nlighted a torch of pinewood, passed down from the hill into the valley.\nFor he had business in his own home.\n\nAnd kneeling on the flint stones of the Valley of Desolation he saw a\r\nyoung man who was naked and weeping.  His hair was the colour of honey,\nand his body was as a white flower, but he had wounded his body with\nthorns and on his hair had he set ashes as a crown.\n\nAnd he who had great possessions said to the young man who was naked and\nweeping, 'I do not wonder that your sorrow is so great, for surely He was\na just man.'\n\nAnd the young man answered, 'It is not for Him that I am weeping, but for\nmyself.  I too have changed water into wine, and I have healed the leper\nand given sight to the blind.  I have walked upon the waters, and from\nthe dwellers in the tombs I have cast out devils.  I have fed the hungry\nin the desert where there was no food, and I have raised the dead from\r\ntheir narrow houses, and at my bidding, and before a great multitude, of\npeople, a barren fig-tree withered away.  All things that this man has\ndone I have done also.  And yet they have not crucified me.'--_Poems in\nProse_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE HOUSE OF JUDGMENT\n\n\nAnd there was silence in the House of Judgment, and the Man came naked\nbefore God.\n\nAnd God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.\n\nAnd God said to the Man, 'Thy life hath been evil, and thou hast shown\ncruelty to those who were in need of succour, and to those who lacked\nhelp thou hast been bitter and hard of heart.  The poor called to thee\nand thou didst not hearken, and thine ears were closed to the cry of My","afflicted.  The inheritance of the fatherless thou didst take unto\nthyself, and thou didst send the foxes into the vineyard of thy\nneighbour's field.  Thou didst take the bread of the children and give it\nto the dogs to eat, and My lepers who lived in the marshes, and were at\npeace and praised Me, thou didst drive forth on to the highways, and on\nMine earth out of which I made thee thou didst spill innocent blood.'\n\nAnd the Man made answer and said, 'Even so did I.'\n\nAnd again God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.\n\nAnd God said to the Man, 'Thy life hath been evil, and the Beauty I have\nshown thou hast sought for, and the Good I have hidden thou didst pass\r\nby.  The walls of thy chamber were painted with images, and from the bed\nof thine abominations thou didst rise up to the sound of flutes.  Thou\ndidst build seven altars to the sins I have suffered, and didst eat of\nthe thing that may not be eaten, and the purple of thy raiment was\nbroidered with the three signs of shame.  Thine idols were neither of\ngold nor of silver that endure, but of flesh that dieth.  Thou didst\nstain their hair with perfumes and put pomegranates in their hands.  Thou\ndidst stain their feet with saffron and spread carpets before them.  With\nantimony thou didst stain their eyelids and their bodies thou didst smear\nwith myrrh.  Thou didst bow thyself to the ground before them, and the\r\nthrones of thine idols were set in the sun.  Thou didst show to the sun\nthy shame and to the moon thy madness.'\n\nAnd the Man made answer and said, 'Even so did I.'\n\nAnd a third time God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.\n\nAnd God said to the Man, 'Evil hath been thy life, and with evil didst\nthou requite good, and with wrongdoing kindness.  The hands that fed thee\nthou didst wound, and the breasts that gave thee suck thou didst despise.\nHe who came to thee with water went away thirsting, and the outlawed men\nwho hid thee in their tents at night thou didst betray before dawn.  Thine\nenemy who spared thee thou didst snare in an ambush, and the friend who","walked with thee thou didst sell for a price, and to those who brought\nthee Love thou didst ever give Lust in thy turn.'\n\nAnd the Man made answer and said, 'Even so did I.'\n\nAnd God closed the Book of the Life of the Man, and said, 'Surely I will\nsend thee into Hell.  Even into Hell will I send thee.'\n\nAnd the Man cried out, 'Thou canst not.'\n\nAnd God said to the Man, 'Wherefore can I not send thee to Hell, and for\nwhat reason?'\n\n'Because in Hell have I always lived,' answered the Man.\n\nAnd there was silence in the House of Judgment.\n\nAnd after a space God spake, and said to the Man, 'Seeing that I may not\nsend thee into Hell, surely I will send thee unto Heaven.  Even unto\nHeaven will I send thee.'\r\nAnd the Man cried out, 'Thou canst not.'\n\nAnd God said to the Man, 'Wherefore can I not send thee unto Heaven, and\nfor what reason?'\n\n'Because never, and in no place, have I been able to imagine it,'\nanswered the Man.\n\nAnd there was silence in the House of Judgment.--_Poems in Prose_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TEACHER OF WISDOM\n\n\nFrom his childhood he had been as one filled with the perfect knowledge\nof God, and even while he was yet but a lad many of the saints, as well\nas certain holy women who dwelt in the free city of his birth, had been\nstirred to much wonder by the grave wisdom of his answers.\n\nAnd when his parents had given him the robe and the ring of manhood he\r\nkissed them, and left them and went out into the world, that he might\nspeak to the world about God.  For there were at that time many in the\nworld who either knew not God at all, or had but an incomplete knowledge\nof Him, or worshipped the false gods who dwell in groves and have no care\nof their worshippers.\n\nAnd he set his face to the sun and journeyed, walking without sandals, as\nhe had seen the saints walk, and carrying at his girdle a leathern wallet\nand a little water-bottle of burnt clay.\n\nAnd as he walked along the highway he was full of the joy that comes from\nthe perfect knowledge of God, and he sang praises unto God without\nceasing; and after a time he reached a strange land in which there were\nmany cities.","And he passed through eleven cities.  And some of these cities were in\nvalleys, and others were by the banks of great rivers, and others were\nset on hills.  And in each city he found a disciple who loved him and\nfollowed him, and a great multitude also of people followed him from each\ncity, and the knowledge of God spread in the whole land, and many of the\nrulers were converted, and the priests of the temples in which there were\nidols found that half of their gain was gone, and when they beat upon\ntheir drums at noon none, or but a few, came with peacocks and with\nofferings of flesh as had been the custom of the land before his coming.\n\nYet the more the people followed him, and the greater the number of his\r\ndisciples, the greater became his sorrow.  And he knew not why his sorrow\nwas so great.  For he spake ever about God, and out of the fulness of\nthat perfect knowledge of God which God had Himself given to him.\n\nAnd one evening he passed out of the eleventh city, which was a city of\nArmenia, and his disciples and a great crowd of people followed after\nhim; and he went up on to a mountain and sat down on a rock that was on\nthe mountain, and his disciples stood round him, and the multitude knelt\nin the valley.\n\nAnd he bowed his head on his hands and wept, and said to his Soul, 'Why\nis it that I am full of sorrow and fear, and that each of my disciples is\r\nan enemy that walks in the noonday?'  And his Soul answered him and said,\n'God filled thee with the perfect knowledge of Himself, and thou hast\ngiven this knowledge away to others.  The pearl of great price thou hast\ndivided, and the vesture without seam thou hast parted asunder.  He who\ngiveth away wisdom robbeth himself.  He is as one who giveth his treasure\nto a robber.  Is not God wiser than thou art?  Who art thou to give away\nthe secret that God hath told thee?  I was rich once, and thou hast made\nme poor.  Once I saw God, and now thou hast hidden Him from me.'\n\nAnd he wept again, for he knew that his Soul spake truth to him, and that\nhe had given to others the perfect knowledge of God, and that he was as","one clinging to the skirts of God, and that his faith was leaving him by\nreason of the number of those who believed in him.\n\nAnd he said to himself, 'I will talk no more about God.  He who giveth\naway wisdom robbeth himself.'\n\nAnd after the space of some hours his disciples came near him and bowed\nthemselves to the ground and said, 'Master, talk to us about God, for\nthou hast the perfect knowledge of God, and no man save thee hath this\nknowledge.'\n\nAnd he answered them and said, 'I will talk to you about all other things\nthat are in heaven and on earth, but about God I will not talk to you.\nNeither now, nor at any time, will I talk to you about God.'\r\nAnd they were wroth with him and said to him, 'Thou hast led us into the\ndesert that we might hearken to thee.  Wilt thou send us away hungry, and\nthe great multitude that thou hast made to follow thee?'\n\nAnd he answered them and said, 'I will not talk to you about God.'\n\nAnd the multitude murmured against him and said to him, 'Thou hast led us\ninto the desert, and hast given us no food to eat.  Talk to us about God\nand it will suffice us.'\n\nBut he answered them not a word.  For he knew that if he spake to them\nabout God he would give away his treasure.\n\nAnd his disciples went away sadly, and the multitude of people returned\nto their own homes.  And many died on the way.\r\nAnd when he was alone he rose up and set his face to the moon, and\njourneyed for seven moons, speaking to no man nor making any answer.  And\nwhen the seventh moon had waned he reached that desert which is the\ndesert of the Great River.  And having found a cavern in which a Centaur\nhad once dwelt, he took it for his place of dwelling, and made himself a\nmat of reeds on which to lie, and became a hermit.  And every hour the\nHermit praised God that He had suffered him to keep some knowledge of Him\nand of His wonderful greatness.\n\nNow, one evening, as the Hermit was seated before the cavern in which he\nhad made his place of dwelling, he beheld a young man of evil and\nbeautiful face who passed by in mean apparel and with empty hands.  Every","evening with empty hands the young man passed by, and every morning he\nreturned with his hands full of purple and pearls.  For he was a Robber\nand robbed the caravans of the merchants.\n\nAnd the Hermit looked at him and pitied him.  But he spake not a word.\nFor he knew that he who speaks a word loses his faith.\n\nAnd one morning, as the young man returned with his hands full of purple\nand pearls, he stopped and frowned and stamped his foot upon the sand,\nand said to the Hermit: 'Why do you look at me ever in this manner as I\npass by?  What is it that I see in your eyes?  For no man has looked at\nme before in this manner.  And the thing is a thorn and a trouble to me.'\r\nAnd the Hermit answered him and said, 'What you see in my eyes is pity.\nPity is what looks out at you from my eyes.'\n\nAnd the young man laughed with scorn, and cried to the Hermit in a bitter\nvoice, and said to him, 'I have purple and pearls in my hands, and you\nhave but a mat of reeds on which to lie.  What pity should you have for\nme?  And for what reason have you this pity?'\n\n'I have pity for you,' said the Hermit, 'because you have no knowledge of\nGod.'\n\n'Is this knowledge of God a precious thing?' asked the young man, and he\ncame close to the mouth of the cavern.\n\n'It is more precious than all the purple and the pearls of the world,'\nanswered the Hermit.\n\n'And have you got it?' said the young Robber, and he came closer still.\r\n'Once, indeed,' answered the Hermit, 'I possessed the perfect knowledge\nof God.  But in my foolishness I parted with it, and divided it amongst\nothers.  Yet even now is such knowledge as remains to me more precious\nthan purple or pearls.'\n\nAnd when the young Robber heard this he threw away the purple and the\npearls that he was bearing in his hands, and drawing a sharp sword of\ncurved steel he said to the Hermit, 'Give me, forthwith this knowledge of\nGod that you possess, or I will surely slay you.  Wherefore should I not\nslay him who has a treasure greater than my treasure?'\n\nAnd the Hermit spread out his arms and said, 'Were it not better for me","to go unto the uttermost courts of God and praise Him, than to live in\nthe world and have no knowledge of Him?  Slay me if that be your desire.\nBut I will not give away my knowledge of God.'\n\nAnd the young Robber knelt down and besought him, but the Hermit would\nnot talk to him about God, nor give him his Treasure, and the young\nRobber rose up and said to the Hermit, 'Be it as you will.  As for\nmyself, I will go to the City of the Seven Sins, that is but three days'\njourney from this place, and for my purple they will give me pleasure,\nand for my pearls they will sell me joy.'  And he took up the purple and\nthe pearls and went swiftly away.\n\nAnd the Hermit cried out and followed him and besought him.  For the\r\nspace of three days he followed the young Robber on the road and\nentreated him to return, nor to enter into the City of the Seven Sins.\n\nAnd ever and anon the young Robber looked back at the Hermit and called\nto him, and said, 'Will you give me this knowledge of God which is more\nprecious than purple and pearls?  If you will give me that, I will not\nenter the city.'\n\nAnd ever did the Hermit answer, 'All things that I have I will give thee,\nsave that one thing only.  For that thing it is not lawful for me to give\naway.'\n\nAnd in the twilight of the third day they came nigh to the great scarlet\ngates of the City of the Seven Sins.  And from the city there came the\nsound of much laughter.\r\nAnd the young Robber laughed in answer, and sought to knock at the gate.\nAnd as he did so the Hermit ran forward and caught him by the skirts of\nhis raiment, and said to him: 'Stretch forth your hands, and set your\narms around my neck, and put your ear close to my lips, and I will give\nyou what remains to me of the knowledge of God.'  And the young Robber\nstopped.\n\nAnd when the Hermit had given away his knowledge of God, he fell upon the\nground and wept, and a great darkness hid from him the city and the young\nRobber, so that he saw them no more.\n\nAnd as he lay there weeping he was ware of One who was standing beside\nhim; and He who was standing beside him had feet of brass and hair like","fine wool.  And He raised the Hermit up, and said to him: 'Before this\ntime thou hadst the perfect knowledge of God.  Now thou shalt have the\nperfect love of God.  Wherefore art thou weeping?'  And he kissed\nhim.--_Poems in Prose_.\n\n\n\n\nWILDE GIVES DIRECTIONS ABOUT 'DE PROFUNDIS'\n\n\nH.M. PRISON, READING.\n\nApril 1st, 1897.\n\nMy Dear Robbie,--I send you a MS. separate from this, which I hope will\narrive safely.  As soon as you have read it, I want you to have it\ncarefully copied for me.  There are many causes why I wish this to be\ndone.  One will suffice.  I want you to be my literary executor in case\nof my death, and to have complete control of my plays, books, and papers.\r\nAs soon as I find I have a legal right to make a will, I will do so.  My\nwife does not understand my art, nor could be expected to have any\ninterest in it, and Cyril is only a child.  So I turn naturally to you,\nas indeed I do for everything, and would like you to have all my works.\nThe deficit that their sale will produce may be lodged to the credit of\nCyril and Vivian.  Well, if you are my literary executor, you must be in\npossession of the only document that gives any explanation of my\nextraordinary behaviour . . . When you have read the letter, you will see\nthe psychological explanation of a course of conduct that from the\noutside seems a combination of absolute idiotcy with vulgar bravado.  Some\r\nday the truth will have to be known--not necessarily in my lifetime . . .\nbut I am not prepared to sit in the grotesque pillory they put me into,\nfor all time; for the simple reason that I inherited from my father and\nmother a name of high distinction in literature and art, and I cannot for\neternity allow that name to be degraded.  I don't defend my conduct.  I\nexplain it.  Also there are in my letter certain passages which deal with\nmy mental development in prison, and the inevitable evolution of my\ncharacter and intellectual attitude towards life that has taken place:\nand I want you and others who still stand by me and have affection for me\nto know exactly in what mood and manner I hope to face the world.  Of","course from one point of view I know that on the day of my release I\nshall be merely passing from one prison into another, and there are times\nwhen the whole world seems to me no larger than my cell and as full of\nterror for me.  Still I believe that at the beginning God made a world\nfor each separate man, and in that world which is within us we should\nseek to live.  At any rate you will read those parts of my letter with\nless pain than the others.  Of course I need not remind you how fluid a\nthing thought is with me--with us all--and of what an evanescent\nsubstance are our emotions made.  Still I do see a sort of possible goal\ntowards which, through art, I may progress.  It is not unlikely that you\r\nmay help me.\n\nAs regards the mode of copying: of course it is too long for any\namanuensis to attempt: and your own handwriting, dear Robbie, in your\nlast letter seems specially designed to remind me that the task is not to\nbe yours.  I think that the only thing to do is to be thoroughly modern\nand to have it typewritten.  Of course the MS. should not pass out of\nyour control, but could you not get Mrs. Marshall to send down one of her\ntype-writing girls--women are the most reliable as they have no memory\nfor the important--to Hornton Street or Phillimore Gardens, to do it\nunder your supervision?  I assure you that the typewriting machine, when\r\nplayed with expression, is not more annoying than the piano when played\nby a sister or near relation.  Indeed many among those most devoted to\ndomesticity prefer it.  I wish the copy to be done not on tissue paper\nbut on good paper such as is used for plays, and a wide rubricated margin\nshould be left for corrections . . . If the copy is done at Hornton\nStreet the lady typewriter might be fed through a lattice in the door,\nlike the Cardinals when they elect a Pope; till she comes out on the\nbalcony and can say to the world: \"Habet Mundus Epistolam\"; for indeed it\nis an Encyclical letter, and as the Bulls of the Holy Father are named\nfrom their opening words, it may be spoken of as the \"_Epistola_: _in","Carcere et Vinculis_.\" . . . In point of fact, Robbie, prison life makes\none see people and things as they really are.  That is why it turns one\nto stone.  It is the people outside who are deceived by the illusions of\na life in constant motion.  They revolve with life and contribute to its\nunreality.  We who are immobile both see and know.  Whether or not the\nletter does good to narrow natures and hectic brains, to me it has done\ngood.  I have \"cleansed my bosom of much perilous stuff\"; to borrow a\nphrase from the poet whom you and I once thought of rescuing from the\nPhilistines.  I need not remind you that mere expression is to an artist\nthe supreme and only mode of life.  It is by utterance that we live.  Of\r\nthe many, many things for which I have to thank the Governor there is\nnone for which I am more grateful than for his permission to write fully\nand at as great a length as I desire.  For nearly two years I had within\na growing burden of bitterness, of much of which I have now got rid.  On\nthe other side of the prison wall there are some poor black\nsoot-besmirched trees that are just breaking out into buds of an almost\nshrill green.  I know quite well what they are going through.  They are\nfinding expression.\n\nEver yours,\n\nOSCAR.\n\n--_Letter from Reading Prison to Robert Ross_.\n\n\n\n\nCAREY STREET\n\n\nWhere there is sorrow there in holy ground.  Some day people will realise\r\nwhat that means.  They will know nothing of life till they do,--and\nnatures like his can realise it.  When I was brought down from my prison\nto the Court of Bankruptcy, between two policemen,--waited in the long\ndreary corridor that, before the whole crowd, whom an action so sweet and\nsimple hushed into silence, he might gravely raise his hat to me, as,\nhandcuffed and with bowed head, I passed him by.  Men have gone to heaven\nfor smaller things than that.  It was in this spirit, and with this mode\nof love, that the saints knelt down to wash the feet of the poor, or\nstooped to kiss the leper on the cheek.  I have never said one single\nword to him about what he did.  I do not know to the present moment","whether he is aware that I was even conscious of his action.  It is not a\nthing for which one can render formal thanks in formal words.  I store it\nin the treasure-house of my heart.  I keep it there as a secret debt that\nI am glad to think I can never possibly repay.  It is embalmed and kept\nsweet by the myrrh and cassia of many tears.  When wisdom has been\nprofitless to me, philosophy barren, and the proverbs and phrases of\nthose who have sought to give me consolation as dust and ashes in my\nmouth, the memory of that little, lovely, silent act of love has unsealed\nfor me all the wells of pity: made the desert blossom like a rose, and\nbrought me out of the bitterness of lonely exile into harmony with the\r\nwounded, broken, and great heart of the world.  When people are able to\nunderstand, not merely how beautiful ---'s action was, but why it meant\nso much to me, and always will mean so much, then, perhaps, they will\nrealise how and in what spirit they should approach me. . . .\n\nThe poor are wise, more charitable, more kind, more sensitive than we\nare.  In their eyes prison is a tragedy in a man's life, a misfortune, a\ncasuality, something that calls for sympathy in others.  They speak of\none who is in prison as of one who is 'in trouble' simply.  It is the\nphrase they always use, and the expression has the perfect wisdom of love\nin it.  With people of our own rank it is different.  With us, prison\r\nmakes a man a pariah.  I, and such as I am, have hardly any right to air\nand sun.  Our presence taints the pleasures of others.  We are unwelcome\nwhen we reappear.  To revisit the glimpses of the moon is not for us.  Our\nvery children are taken away.  Those lovely links with humanity are\nbroken.  We are doomed to be solitary, while our sons still live.  We are\ndenied the one thing that might heal us and keep us, that might bring\nbalm to the bruised heart, and peace to the soul in pain.--_De\nProfundis_.\n\n\n\n\nSORROW WEARS NO MASK\n\n\nSorrow, being the supreme emotion of which man is capable, is at once the\ntype and test of all great art.  What the artist is always looking for is","the mode of existence in which soul and body are one and indivisible: in\nwhich the outward is expressive of the inward: in which form reveals.  Of\nsuch modes of existence there are not a few: youth and the arts\npreoccupied with youth may serve as a model for us at one moment: at\nanother we may like to think that, in its subtlety and sensitiveness of\nimpression, its suggestion of a spirit dwelling in external things and\nmaking its raiment of earth and air, of mist and city alike, and in its\nmorbid sympathy of its moods, and tones, and colours, modern landscape\nart is realising for us pictorially what was realised in such plastic\nperfection by the Greeks.  Music, in which all subject is absorbed in\r\nexpression and cannot be separated from it, is a complex example, and a\nflower or a child a simple example, of what I mean; but sorrow is the\nultimate type both in life and art.\n\nBehind joy and laughter there may be a temperament, coarse, hard and\ncallous.  But behind sorrow there is always sorrow.  Pain, unlike\npleasure, wears no mask.  Truth in art is not any correspondence between\nthe essential idea and the accidental existence; it is not the\nresemblance of shape to shadow, or of the form mirrored in the crystal to\nthe form itself; it is no echo coming from a hollow hill, any more than\nit is a silver well of water in the valley that shows the moon to the\r\nmoon and Narcissus to Narcissus.  Truth in art is the unity of a thing\nwith itself: the outward rendered expressive of the inward: the soul made\nincarnate: the body instinct with spirit.  For this reason there is no\ntruth comparable to sorrow.  There are times when sorrow seems to me to\nbe the only truth.  Other things may be illusions of the eye or the\nappetite, made to blind the one and cloy the other, but out of sorrow\nhave the worlds been built, and at the birth of a child or a star there\nis pain.\n\nMore than this, there is about sorrow an intense, an extraordinary\nreality.  I have said of myself that I was one who stood in symbolic\nrelations to the art and culture of my age.  There is not a single","wretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in\nsymbolic relation to the very secret of life.  For the secret of life is\nsuffering.  It is what is hidden behind everything.  When we begin to\nlive, what is sweet is so sweet to us, and what is bitter so bitter, that\nwe inevitably direct all our desires towards pleasures, and seek not\nmerely for a 'month or twain to feed on honeycomb,' but for all our years\nto taste no other food, ignorant all the while that we may really be\nstarving the soul.--_De Profundis_.\n\n\n\n\nVITA NUOVA\n\n\nFar off, like a perfect pearl, one can see the city of God.  It is so\nwonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summer's day.\r\nAnd so a child could.  But with me and such as me it is different.  One\ncan realise a thing in a single moment, but one loses it in the long\nhours that follow with leaden feet.  It is so difficult to keep 'heights\nthat the soul is competent to gain.'  We think in eternity, but we move\nslowly through time; and how slowly time goes with us who lie in prison I\nneed not tell again, nor of the weariness and despair that creep back\ninto one's cell, and into the cell of one's heart, with such strange\ninsistence that one has, as it were, to garnish and sweep one's house for\ntheir coming, as for an unwelcome guest, or a bitter master, or a slave\nwhose slave it is one's chance or choice to be.\r\nAnd, though at present my friends may find it a hard thing to believe, it\nis true none the less, that for them living in freedom and idleness and\ncomfort it is more easy to learn the lessons of humility than it is for\nme, who begin the day by going down on my knees and washing the floor of\nmy cell.  For prison life with its endless privations and restrictions\nmakes one rebellious.  The most terrible thing about it is not that it\nbreaks one's heart--hearts are made to be broken--but that it turns one's\nheart to stone.  One sometimes feels that it is only with a front of\nbrass and a lip of scorn that one can get through the day at all.  And he","who is in a state of rebellion cannot receive grace, to use the phrase of\nwhich the Church is so fond--so rightly fond, I dare say--for in life as\nin art the mood of rebellion closes up the channels of the soul, and\nshuts out the airs of heaven.  Yet I must learn these lessons here, if I\nam to learn them anywhere, and must be filled with joy if my feet are on\nthe right road and my face set towards 'the gate which is called\nbeautiful,' though I may fall many times in the mire and often in the\nmist go astray.\n\nThis New Life, as through my love of Dante I like sometimes to call it,\nis of course no new life at all, but simply the continuance, by means of\ndevelopment, and evolution, of my former life.  I remember when I was at\r\nOxford saying to one of my friends as we were strolling round Magdalen's\nnarrow bird-haunted walks one morning in the year before I took my\ndegree, that I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden\nof the world, and that I was going out into the world with that passion\nin my soul.  And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived.  My only mistake\nwas that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to\nme the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its\nshadow and its gloom.  Failure, disgrace, poverty, sorrow, despair,\nsuffering, tears even, the broken words that come from lips in pain,\nremorse that makes one walk on thorns, conscience that condemns, self-\r\nabasement that punishes, the misery that puts ashes on its head, the\nanguish that chooses sack-cloth for its raiment and into its own drink\nputs gall:--all these were things of which I was afraid.  And as I had\ndetermined to know nothing of them, I was forced to taste each of them in\nturn, to feed on them, to have for a season, indeed, no other food at\nall.\n\nI don't regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure.  I did it\nto the full, as one should do everything that one does.  There was no\npleasure I did not experience.  I threw the pearl of my soul into a cup\nof wine.  I went down the primrose path to the sound of flutes.  I lived\non honeycomb.  But to have continued the same life would have been wrong","because it would have been limiting.  I had to pass on.  The other half\nof the garden had its secrets for me also.--_De Profundis_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GRAND ROMANTIC\n\n\nIt is when he deals with a sinner that Christ is most romantic, in the\nsense of most real.  The world had always loved the saint as being the\nnearest possible approach to the perfection of God.  Christ, through some\ndivine instinct in him, seems to have always loved the sinner as being\nthe nearest possible approach to the perfection of man.  His primary\ndesire was not to reform people, any more than his primary desire was to\na relieve suffering.  To turn an interesting thief into a tedious honest\r\nman was not his aim.  He would have thought little of the Prisoners' Aid\nSociety and other modern movements of the kind.  The conversion of a\npublican into a Pharisee would not have seemed to him a great\nachievement.  But in a manner not yet understood of the world he regarded\nsin and suffering as being in themselves beautiful holy things and modes\nof perfection.\n\nIt seems a very dangerous idea.  It is--all great ideas are dangerous.\nThat it was Christ's creed admits of no doubt.  That it is the true creed\nI don't doubt myself.\n\nOf course the sinner must repent.  But why?  Simply because otherwise he\nwould be unable to realise what he had done.  The moment of repentance is\r\nthe moment of initiation.  More than that: it is the means by which one\nalters one's past.  The Greeks thought that impossible.  They often say\nin their Gnomic aphorisms, 'Even the Gods cannot alter the past.'  Christ\nshowed that the commonest sinner could do it, that it was the one thing\nhe could do.  Christ, had he been asked, would have said--I feel quite\ncertain about it--that the moment the prodigal son fell on his knees and\nwept, he made his having wasted his substance with harlots, his swine-\nherding and hungering for the husks they ate, beautiful and holy moments\nin his life.  It is difficult for most people to grasp the idea.  I dare\nsay one has to go to prison to understand it.  If so, it may be worth","while going to prison.\n\nThere is something so unique about Christ.  Of course just as there are\nfalse dawns before the dawn itself, and winter days so full of sudden\nsunlight that they will cheat the wise crocus into squandering its gold\nbefore its time, and make some foolish bird call to its mate to build on\nbarren boughs, so there were Christians before Christ.  For that we\nshould be grateful.  The unfortunate thing is that there have been none\nsince.  I make one exception, St. Francis of Assisi.  But then God had\ngiven him at his birth the soul of a poet, as he himself when quite young\nhad in mystical marriage taken poverty as his bride: and with the soul of\r\na poet and the body of a beggar he found the way to perfection not\ndifficult.  He understood Christ, and so he became like him.  We do not\nrequire the Liber Conformitatum to teach us that the life of St. Francis\nwas the true _Imitatio Christi_, a poem compared to which the book of\nthat name is merely prose.\n\nIndeed, that is the charm about Christ, when all is said: he is just like\na work of art.  He does not really teach one anything, but by being\nbrought into his presence one becomes something.  And everybody is\npredestined to his presence.  Once at least in his life each man walks\nwith Christ to Emmaus.--_De Profundis_.\n\n\n\n\nCLAPHAM JUNCTION\n\n\nMy lot has been one of public infamy, of long imprisonment, of misery, of\r\nruin, of disgrace, but I am not worthy of it--not yet, at any rate.  I\nremember that I used to say that I thought I could bear a real tragedy if\nit came to me with purple pall and a mask of noble sorrow, but that the\ndreadful thing about modernity was that it put tragedy into the raiment\nof comedy, so that the great realities seemed commonplace or grotesque or\nlacking in style.  It is quite true about modernity.  It has probably\nalways been true about actual life.  It is said that all martyrdoms\nseemed mean to the looker on.  The nineteenth century is no exception to\nthe rule.\n\nEverything about my tragedy has been hideous, mean, repellent, lacking in","style; our very dress makes us grotesque.  We are the zanies of sorrow.\nWe are clowns whose hearts are broken.  We are specially designed to\nappeal to the sense of humour.  On November 13th, 1895, I was brought\ndown here from London.  From two o'clock till half-past two on that day I\nhad to stand on the centre platform of Clapham Junction in convict dress,\nand handcuffed, for the world to look at.  I had been taken out of the\nhospital ward without a moment's notice being given to me.  Of all\npossible objects I was the most grotesque.  When people saw me they\nlaughed.  Each train as it came up swelled the audience.  Nothing could\nexceed their amusement.  That was, of course, before they knew who I was.\r\nAs soon as they had been informed they laughed still more.  For half an\nhour I stood there in the grey November rain surrounded by a jeering\nmob.--_De Profundis_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROKEN RESOLUTION\n\n\nWe call ours a utilitarian age, and we do not know the uses of any single\nthing.  We have forgotten that water can cleanse, and fire purify, and\nthat the Earth is mother to us all.  As a consequence our art is of the\nmoon and plays with shadows, while Greek art is of the sun and deals\ndirectly with things.  I feel sure that in elemental forces there is\npurification, and I want to go back to them and live in their presence.\n\nOf course to one so modern as I am, 'Enfant de mon siecle,' merely to\r\nlook at the world will be always lovely.  I tremble with pleasure when I\nthink that on the very day of my leaving prison both the laburnum and the\nlilac will be blooming in the gardens, and that I shall see the wind stir\ninto restless beauty the swaying gold of the one, and make the other toss\nthe pale purple of its plumes, so that all the air shall be Arabia for\nme.  Linnaeus fell on his knees and wept for joy when he saw for the\nfirst time the long heath of some English upland made yellow with the\ntawny aromatic brooms of the common furze; and I know that for me, to\nwhom flowers are part of desire, there are tears waiting in the petals of\nsome rose.  It has always been so with me from my boyhood.  There is not","a single colour hidden away in the chalice of a flower, or the curve of a\nshell, to which, by some subtle sympathy with the very soul of things, my\nnature does not answer.  Like Gautier, I have always been one of those\n'pour qui le monde visible existe.'\n\nStill, I am conscious now that behind all this beauty, satisfying though\nit may be, there is some spirit hidden of which the painted forms and\nshapes are but modes of manifestation, and it is with this spirit that I\ndesire to become in harmony.  I have grown tired of the articulate\nutterances of men and things.  The Mystical in Art, the Mystical in Life,\nthe Mystical in Nature this is what I am looking for.  It is absolutely\r\nnecessary for me to find it somewhere.\n\nAll trials are trials for one's life, just as all sentences are sentences\nof death; and three times have I been tried.  The first time I left the\nbox to be arrested, the second time to be led back to the house of\ndetention, the third time to pass into a prison for two years.  Society,\nas we have constituted it, will have no place for me, has none to offer;\nbut Nature, whose sweet rains fall on unjust and just alike, will have\nclefts in the rocks where I may hide, and secret valleys in whose silence\nI may weep undisturbed.  She will hang the night with stars so that I may\nwalk abroad in the darkness without stumbling, and send the wind over my\r\nfootprints so that none may track me to my hurt: she will cleanse me in\ngreat waters, and with bitter herbs make me whole.--_De Profundis_.\n\n\n\n\nDOMESTICITY AT BERNEVAL\n\n\nDIEPPE,\n\nJune 1st, 1897.\n\nMy Dear Robbie,--I propose to live at Berneval.  I will _not_ live in\nParis, nor in Algiers, nor in Southern Italy.  Surely a house for a year,\nif I choose to continue there, at 32 pounds is absurdly cheap.  I could\nnot live cheaper at a hotel.  You are penny foolish, and pound foolish--a\ndreadful state for my financier to be in.  I told M. Bonnet that my\nbankers were MM. Ross et Cie, banquiers celebres de Londres--and now you\nsuddenly show me that you have no place among the great financial people,","and are afraid of any investment over 31 pounds, 10s.  It is merely the\nextra ten shillings that baffles you.  As regards people living on me,\nand the extra bedrooms: dear boy, there is no one who would stay with me\nbut you, and you will pay your own bill at the hotel for meals; and as\nfor your room, the charge will be nominally 2 francs 50 centimes a night,\nbut there will be lots of extras such as _bougie, bain_ and hot water,\nand all cigarettes smoked in the bedrooms are charged extra.  And if any\none does not take the extras, of course he is charged more:--\n\n   Bain, 25 C.\n\n   Pas de bain, 50 C.\n\n   Cigarette dans la chambre a coucher, 10 C. pour chaque cigarette.\n\n   Pas de cigarette dans la chambre a coucher, 20 C. pour chaque\r\ncigarette.\n\nThis is the system at all good hotels.  If Reggie comes, of course he\nwill pay a little more: I cannot forget that he gave me a dressing-case.\nSphinxes pay a hundred per cent more than any one else--they always did\nin Ancient Egypt.\n\nBut seriously, Robbie, if people stayed with me, of course they would pay\ntheir _pension_ at the hotel.  They would have to: except architects.  A\nmodern architect, like modern architecture, doesn't pay.  But then I know\nonly one architect and you are hiding him somewhere from me.  I believe\nthat he is as extinct as the dado, of which now only fossil remains are\nfound, chiefly in the vicinity of Brompton, where they are sometimes\r\ndiscovered by workmen excavating.  They are usually embedded in the old\nLincrusta Walton strata, and are rare consequently.\n\nI visited M. le Cure {4} to-day.  He has a charming house and a _jardin\npotager_.  He showed me over the church.  To-morrow I sit in the choir by\nhis special invitation.  He showed me all his vestments.  To-morrow he\nreally will be charming in red.  He knows I am a heretic, and believes\nPusey is still alive.  He says that God will convert England on account\nof England's kindness to _les pretres exiles_ at the time of the\nRevolution.  It is to be the reward of that sea-lashed island.\n\nStained glass windows are wanted in the church; he has only six; fourteen","more are needed.  He gets them at 300 francs--12 pounds--a window in\nParis.  I was nearly offering half a dozen, but remembered you, and so\nonly gave him something _pour les pauvres_.  You had a narrow escape,\nRobbie.  You should be thankful.\n\nI hope the 40 pounds is on its way, and that the 60 pounds will follow.  I\nam going to hire a boat.  It will save walking and so be an economy in\nthe end.  Dear Robbie, I must start well.  If the life of St. Francis of\nAssissi awaits me I shall not be angry.  Worse things might happen.\n\nYours,\n\nOSCAR.\n\n--_Letter to Robert Ross_.\n\n\n\n\nA VISIT TO THE POPE\n\n\nc/o COOK & SON, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA, ROME,\n\nApril 16th, 1900.\n\nMy dear Robbie,--I simply cannot write.  It is too horrid, not of me, but\r\nto me.  It is a mode of paralysis--a _cacoethes tacendi_--the one form\nthat malady takes in me.\n\nWell, all passed over very successfully.  Palermo, where we stayed eight\ndays, was lovely.  The most beautifully situated town in the world--it\ndreams away its life in the _concha d'oro_, the exquisite valley that\nlies between two seas.  The lemon groves and the orange gardens were so\nentirely perfect that I became quite a Pre-Raphaelite, and loathed the\nordinary impressionists whose muddly souls and blurred intelligences\nwould have rendered, but by mud and blur, those \"golden lamps hung in a\ngreen night\" that filled me with such joy.  The elaborate and exquisite\r\ndetail of the true Pre-Raphaelite is the compensation they offer us for\nthe absence of motion; literature and motion being the only arts that are\nnot immobile.\n\nThen nowhere, not even at Ravenna, have I seen such mosaics as in the\nCapella Palatine, which from pavement to domed ceiling is all gold: one\nreally feels as if one was sitting in the heart of a great honey-comb\nlooking at angels singing: and _looking_ at angels, or indeed at people,\nsinging, is much nicer than listening to them, for this reason: the great\nartists always give to their angels lutes without strings, pipes without\nvent-holes, and reeds through which no wind can wander or make\nwhistlings.\n\nMonreale you have heard of--with its cloisters and cathedral: we often","drove there.\n\nI also made great friends with a young seminarist, who lived in the\ncathedral of Palermo--he and eleven others, in little rooms beneath the\nroof, like birds.\n\nEvery day he showed me all over the cathedral, I knelt before the huge\nporphyry sarcophagus in which Frederick the Second lies: it is a sublime\nbare monstrous thing--blood-coloured, and held up by lions who have\ncaught some of the rage of the great Emperor's restless soul.  At first\nmy young friend, Giuseppe Loverdi, gave me information; but on the third\nday I gave information to him, and re-wrote history as usual, and told\nhim all about the supreme King and his Court of Poets, and the terrible\r\nbook that he never wrote.  His reason for entering the church was\nsingularly mediaeval.  I asked him why he thought of becoming a\n_clerico_, and how.  He answered: \"My father is a cook and most poor; and\nwe are many at home, so it seemed to me a good thing that there should be\nin so small a house as ours, one mouth less to feed; for though I am\nslim, I eat much, too much, alas! I fear.\"\n\nI told him to be comforted, because God used poverty often as a means of\nbringing people to Him, and used riches never, or rarely; so Giuseppe was\ncomforted, and I gave him a little book of devotion, very pretty, and\nwith far more pictures than prayers in it--so of great service to\r\nGiuseppe whose eyes are beautiful.  I also gave him many _lire_, and\nprophesied for him a Cardinal's hat, if he remained very good and never\nforgot me.\n\nAt Naples we stopped three days: most of my friends are, as you know, in\nprison, but I met some of nice memory.\n\nWe came to Rome on Holy Thursday.  H--- left on Saturday for Gland--and\nyesterday, to the terror of Grissell {5} and all the Papal Court, I\nappeared in the front rank of the pilgrims in the Vatican, and got the\nblessing of the Holy Father--a blessing they would have denied me.\n\nHe was wonderful as he was carried past me on his throne--not of flesh\nand blood, but a white soul robed in white and an artist as well as a","saint--the only instance in history, if the newspapers are to be\nbelieved.  I have seen nothing like the extraordinary grace of his\ngestures as he rose, from moment to moment, to bless--possibly the\npilgrims, but certainly me.\n\nTree should see him.  It is his only chance.\n\nI was deeply impressed, and my walking-stick showed signs of budding,\nwould have budded, indeed, only at the door of the Chapel it was taken\nfrom me by the Knave of Spades.  This strange prohibition is, of course,\nin honour of Tannhauser.\n\nHow did I get the ticket?  By a miracle, of course.  I thought it was\nhopeless and made no effort of any kind.  On Saturday afternoon at five\no'clock H--- and I went to have tea at the Hotel de l'Europe.  Suddenly,\r\nas I was eating buttered toast, a man--or what seemed to be one--dressed\nlike a hotel porter entered and asked me would I like to see the Pope on\nEaster Day.  I bowed my head humbly and said \"Non sum dignus,\" or words\nto that effect.  He at once produced a ticket!\n\nWhen I tell you that his countenance was of supernatural ugliness, and\nthat the price of the ticket was thirty pieces of silver, I need say no\nmore.\n\nAn equally curious thing is that whenever I pass the hotel, which I do\nconstantly, I see the same man.  Scientists call that phenomenon an\nobsession of the visual nerve.  You and I know better.\n\nOn the afternoon of Easter Day I heard Vespers at the Lateran: music\r\nquite lovely.  At the close, a Bishop in red, and with red gloves--such\nas Pater talks of in _Gaston de Latour_--came out on the balcony and\nshowed us the Relics.  He was swarthy, and wore a yellow mitre.  A\nsinister mediaeval man, but superbly Gothic, just like the bishops carved\non stalls or on portals: and when one thinks that once people mocked at\nstained-glass attitudes! they are the only attitudes for the clothes.  The\nsight of the Bishop, whom I watched with fascination, filled me with the\ngreat sense of the realism of Gothic art.  Neither in Greek art nor in\nGothic art is there any pose.  Posing was invented by bad\nportrait-painters; and the first person who posed was a stock-broker, and","he has gone on posing ever since.\n\nI send you a photograph I took on Palm Sunday at Palermo.  Do send me\nsome of yours, and love me always, and try to read this letter.\n\nKindest regards to your dear mother.\n\nAlways,\n\nOSCAR.\n\n--_Letter to Robert Ross_.\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n\n{1}  \"The Influence of Pater and Matthew Arnold in the Prose-Writings of\nOscar Wilde,\" by Ernst Bendz.

empire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npreface\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the possible exceptions of the greek anthology the golden\r\ntreasury and those which bear the name of e v lucas no selections of\r\npoetry or prose have ever given complete satisfaction to anyone except\r\nthe compiler  but critics derive great satisfaction from pointing out\r\nerrors of omission and inclusion on the part of the anthologist and all\r\nof us have putatively rearranged and reedited even the golden\r\ntreasury in our leisure moments  in an age when art for arts sake is\r\nan exploded doctrine anthologies like everything else must have a\r\npurpose  the purpose or object of the present volume is to afford\r\nadmirers of wildes work the same innocent pleasure obtainable from\r\nsimilar compilations namely that of reconstructing a selection of their\r\nown in their minds eyefor copyright considerations would interfere\r\nwith the materialisation of their dream\r\n\r\na stray observation in an esteemed weekly periodical determined the plan\r\nof this anthology and the choice of particular passages  the writer\r\nwhose name has escaped me opined that the reason the works of pater and\r\nwilde were no longer read was owing to both authors having treated\r\nenglish as a dead language  by a singular coincidence i had purchased\r\nsimultaneously with the newspaper a shilling copy of paters\r\nrenaissance published by messrs macmillan and a few days afterwards\r\nmessrs methuen issued at a shilling the twentyeighth edition of de\r\nprofundis  obviously either messrs macmillan and messrs methuen or\r\nthe authority on dead languages must have been suffering from\r\nhallucinations  it occurred to me that a selection of wildes prose\r\nmight at least rehabilitate the notorious reputation for common sense\r\nenjoyed by all publishers who rarely issue shilling editions of deceased\r\nauthors for mere aesthetic considerations  and i confess to a hope that\r\nthis volume may reach the eye or ear of those who have not read wildes\r\nbooks or of those such as mr sydney grundy who are irritated by the\r\nrevival of his plays and the praise accorded to his works throughout the\r\ncontinent\r\n\r\nwildes prose is distinguished by its extraordinary ease and clarity and\r\nby the absencevery singular in his caseof the preciosity which he\r\nadmired too much in other writers and advocated with overemphasis\r\nperhaps that is why many of his stories and essays and plays are used as\r\nenglish textbooks in russian and scandinavian and hungarian schools\r\nartifice and affectation often assumed to be recurrent defects in his\r\nwritings by those unacquainted with them are comparatively rare  wilde\r\nonce boasted in an interview that only flaubert pater keats and\r\nmaeterlinck had influenced him and then added in a characteristic way\r\nbut i had already gone more than halfway to meet them  anyone curious\r\nas to the origin of wildes style and development should consult the\r\nlearned treatise  of dr ernst bendz whose comprehensive treatment of\r\nthe subject renders any elucidation of mine superfluous while nothing\r\ncan be added to mr holbrook jacksons masterly criticism  of wilde\r\nand his position in literature\r\n\r\nin making this selection with the valuable assistance of mr stuart\r\nmason i have endeavoured to illustrate and to justify the critical\r\nappreciations of both dr bendz and mr holbrook jackson as well as to\r\nafford the general reader a fair idea of wildes variety as a prose\r\nwriter  he is more various than almost any author of the last century\r\nthough the act of writing was always a burden to him  some critic\r\nacutely pointed out that poetry and prose were almost sideissues for\r\nhim  the resulting faults and weakness of what he left are obvious\r\nexcept in the plays he has no sustained scheme of thought  even de\r\nprofundis is too desultory\r\n\r\nfor the purpose of convenient reference i have exercised the prerogative\r\nof a literary executor and editor by endowing with special titles some of\r\nthe pieces quoted in these pages  though unlike one of wildes other\r\nfriends i cannot claim to have collaborated with him or to have assisted\r\nhim in any of his plays i was sometimes permitted as wilde acknowledges\r\nin different letters to act in the capacity of godfather by suggesting\r\nthe actual titles by which some of his books are known to the world  i\r\nmention the circumstance only as a precedent for my present temerity  to\r\ncompensate those who disapprove of my choice i have included two\r\nunpublished letters  the examples of wildes epistolary style published\r\nsince his death have been generally associated with disagreeable\r\nsubjects  those included here will i hope prove a pleasant contrast\r\n\r\nrobert ross\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow they struck a contemporary\r\n\r\n\r\nthere is such a thing as robbing a story of its reality by trying to make\r\nit too true and the black arrow is so inartistic as not to contain a\r\nsingle anachronism to boast of while the transformation of dr jekyll\r\nreads dangerously like an experiment out of the lancet  as for mr\r\nrider haggard who really has or had once the makings of a perfectly\r\nmagnificent liar he is now so afraid of being suspected of genius that\r\nwhen he does tell us anything marvellous he feels bound to invent a\r\npersonal reminiscence and to put it into a footnote as a kind of\r\ncowardly corroboration  nor are our other novelists much better  mr\r\nhenry james writes fiction as if it were a painful duty and wastes upon\r\nmean motives and imperceptible points of view his neat literary style\r\nhis felicitous phrases his swift and caustic satire  mr hall caine it\r\nis true aims at the grandiose but then he writes at the top of his\r\nvoice  he is so loud that one cannot bear what he says  mr james payn\r\nis an adept in the art of concealing what is not worth finding  he hunts\r\ndown the obvious with the enthusiasm of a shortsighted detective  as\r\none turns over the pages the suspense of the author becomes almost\r\nunbearable  the horses of mr william blacks phaeton do not soar\r\ntowards the sun  they merely frighten the sky at evening into violent\r\nchromolithographic effects  on seeing them approach the peasants take\r\nrefuge in dialect  mrs oliphant prattles pleasantly about curates lawn\r\ntennis parties domesticity and other wearisome things  mr marion\r\ncrawford has immolated himself upon the altar of local colour  he is\r\nlike the lady in the french comedy who keeps talking about le beau ciel\r\nditalie  besides he has fallen into the bad habit of uttering moral\r\nplatitudes  he is always telling us that to be good is to be good and\r\nthat to be bad is to be wicked  at times he is almost edifying  robert\r\nelsmere is of course a masterpiecea masterpiece of the genre\r\nennuyeux the one form of literature that the english people seems\r\nthoroughly to enjoy  a thoughtful young friend of ours once told us that\r\nit reminded him of the sort of conversation that goes on at a meat tea in\r\nthe house of a serious nonconformist family and we can quite believe it\r\nindeed it is only in england that such a book could be produced  england\r\nis the home of lost ideas  as for that great and daily increasing school\r\nof novelists for whom the sun always rises in the eastend the only\r\nthing that can be said about them is that they find life crude and leave\r\nit rawthe decay of lying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe quality of george meredith\r\n\r\n\r\nah  meredith  who can define him  his style is chaos illumined by\r\nflashes of lightning  as a writer he has mastered everything except\r\nlanguage as a novelist he can do everything except tell a story as an\r\nartist he is everything except articulate  somebody in\r\nshakespearetouchstone i thinktalks about a man who is always\r\nbreaking his shins over his own wit and it seems to me that this might\r\nserve as the basis for a criticism of merediths method  but whatever he\r\nis he is not a realist  or rather i would say that he is a child of\r\nrealism who is not on speaking terms with his father  by deliberate\r\nchoice he has made himself a romanticist  he has refused to bow the knee\r\nto baal and after all even if the mans fine spirit did not revolt\r\nagainst the noisy assertions of realism his style would be quite\r\nsufficient of itself to keep life at a respectful distance  by its means\r\nhe has planted round his garden a hedge full of thorns and red with\r\nwonderful roses  as for balzac he was a most remarkable combination of\r\nthe artistic temperament with the scientific spirit  the latter he\r\nbequeathed to his disciples  the former was entirely his own  the\r\ndifference between such a book as m zolas lassommoir and balzacs\r\nillusions perdues is the difference between unimaginative realism and\r\nimaginative reality  all balzacs characters said baudelaire are\r\ngifted with the same ardour of life that animated himself  all his\r\nfictions are as deeply coloured as dreams  each mind is a weapon loaded\r\nto the muzzle with will  the very scullions have genius  a steady\r\ncourse of balzac reduces our living friends to shadows and our\r\nacquaintances to the shadows of shades  his characters have a kind of\r\nfervent fierycoloured existence  they dominate us and defy scepticism\r\none of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of lucien de\r\nrubempre  it is a grief from which i have never been able completely to\r\nrid myself  it haunts me in my moments of pleasure  i remember it when\r\ni laugh  but balzac is no more a realist than holbein was  he created\r\nlife he did not copy it  i admit however that he set far too high a\r\nvalue on modernity of form and that consequently there is no book of\r\nhis that as an artistic masterpiece can rank with salammbo or\r\nesmond or the cloister and the hearth or the vicomte de\r\nbragelonnethe decay of lying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlife the fallacious model\r\n\r\n\r\nart begins with abstract decoration with purely imaginative and\r\npleasurable work dealing with what is unreal and nonexistent  this is\r\nthe first stage  then life becomes fascinated with this new wonder and\r\nasks to be admitted into the charmed circle  art takes life as part of\r\nher rough material recreates it and refashions it in fresh forms is\r\nabsolutely indifferent to fact invents imagines dreams and keeps\r\nbetween herself and reality the impenetrable barrier of beautiful style\r\nof decorative or ideal treatment  the third stage is when life gets the\r\nupper hand and drives art out into the wilderness  that is the true\r\ndecadence and it is from this that we are now suffering\r\n\r\ntake the case of the english drama  at first in the hands of the monks\r\ndramatic art was abstract decorative and mythological  then she\r\nenlisted life in her service and using some of lifes external forms\r\nshe created an entirely new race of beings whose sorrows were more\r\nterrible than any sorrow man has ever felt whose joys were keener than\r\nlovers joys who had the rage of the titans and the calm of the gods\r\nwho had monstrous and marvellous sins monstrous and marvellous virtues\r\nto them she gave a language different from that of actual use a language\r\nfull of resonant music and sweet rhythm made stately by solemn cadence\r\nor made delicate by fanciful rhyme jewelled with wonderful words and\r\nenriched with lofty diction  she clothed her children in strange raiment\r\nand gave them masks and at her bidding the antique world rose from its\r\nmarble tomb  a new caesar stalked through the streets of risen rome and\r\nwith purple sail and fluteled oars another cleopatra passed up the river\r\nto antioch  old myth and legend and dream took shape and substance\r\nhistory was entirely rewritten and there was hardly one of the\r\ndramatists who did not recognise that the object of art is not simple\r\ntruth but complex beauty  in this they were perfectly right  art itself\r\nis really a form of exaggeration and selection which is the very spirit\r\nof art is nothing more than an intensified mode of overemphasis\r\n\r\nbut life soon shattered the perfection of the form  even in shakespeare\r\nwe can see the beginning of the end  it shows itself by the gradual\r\nbreakingup of the blankverse in the later plays by the predominance\r\ngiven to prose and by the overimportance assigned to characterisation\r\nthe passages in shakespeareand they are manywhere the language is\r\nuncouth vulgar exaggerated fantastic obscene even are entirely due\r\nto life calling for an echo of her own voice and rejecting the\r\nintervention of beautiful style through which alone should life be\r\nsuffered to find expression  shakespeare is not by any means a flawless\r\nartist  he is too fond of going directly to life and borrowing lifes\r\nnatural utterance  he forgets that when art surrenders her imaginative\r\nmedium she surrenders everythingthe decay of lying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlife the disciple\r\n\r\n\r\nwe have all seen in our own day in england how a certain curious and\r\nfascinating type of beauty invented and emphasised by two imaginative\r\npainters has so influenced life that whenever one goes to a private view\r\nor to an artistic salon one sees here the mystic eyes of rossettis\r\ndream the long ivory throat the strange squarecut jaw the loosened\r\nshadowy hair that he so ardently loved there the sweet maidenhood of\r\nthe golden stair the blossomlike mouth and weary loveliness of the\r\nlaus amoris the passionpale face of andromeda the thin hands and\r\nlithe beauty of the vivian in merlins dream  and it has always been\r\nso  a great artist invents a type and life tries to copy it to\r\nreproduce it in a popular form like an enterprising publisher  neither\r\nholbein nor vandyck found in england what they have given us  they\r\nbrought their types with them and life with her keen imitative faculty\r\nset herself to supply the master with models  the greeks with their\r\nquick artistic instinct understood this and set in the brides chamber\r\nthe statue of hermes or of apollo that she might bear children as lovely\r\nas the works of art that she looked at in her rapture or her pain  they\r\nknew that life gains from art not merely spirituality depth of thought\r\nand feeling soulturmoil or soulpeace but that she can form herself on\r\nthe very lines and colours of art and can reproduce the dignity of\r\npheidias as well as the grace of praxiteles  hence came their objection\r\nto realism  they disliked it on purely social grounds  they felt that\r\nit inevitably makes people ugly and they were perfectly right  we try\r\nto improve the conditions of the race by means of good air free\r\nsunlight wholesome water and hideous bare buildings for the better\r\nhousing of the lower orders  but these things merely produce health\r\nthey do not produce beauty  for this art is required and the true\r\ndisciples of the great artist are not his studioimitators but those who\r\nbecome like his works of art be they plastic as in greek days or\r\npictorial as in modern times in a word life is arts best arts only\r\npupilthe decay of lying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlife the plagiarist\r\n\r\n\r\ni once asked a lady who knew thackeray intimately whether he had had\r\nany model for becky sharp  she told me that becky was an invention but\r\nthat the idea of the character had been partly suggested by a governess\r\nwho lived in the neighbourhood of kensington square and was the\r\ncompanion of a very selfish and rich old woman  i inquired what became\r\nof the governess and she replied that oddly enough some years after\r\nthe appearance of vanity fair she ran away with the nephew of the lady\r\nwith whom she was living and for a short time made a great splash in\r\nsociety quite in mrs rawdon crawleys style and entirely by mrs\r\nrawdon crawleys methods  ultimately she came to grief disappeared to\r\nthe continent and used to be occasionally seen at monte carlo and other\r\ngambling places  the noble gentleman from whom the same great\r\nsentimentalist drew colonel newcome died a few months after the\r\nnewcomer had reached a fourth edition with the word adsum on his\r\nlips  shortly after mr stevenson published his curious psychological\r\nstory of transformation a friend of mine called mr hyde was in the\r\nnorth of london and being anxious to get to a railway station took what\r\nhe thought would be a short cut lost his way and found himself in a\r\nnetwork of mean evillooking streets  feeling rather nervous he began\r\nto walk extremely fast when suddenly out of an archway ran a child right\r\nbetween his legs  it fell on the pavement he tripped over it and\r\ntrampled upon it  being of course very much frightened and a little\r\nhurt it began to scream and in a few seconds the whole street was full\r\nof rough people who came pouring out of the houses like ants  they\r\nsurrounded him and asked him his name  he was just about to give it\r\nwhen he suddenly remembered the opening incident in mr stevensons\r\nstory  he was so filled with horror at having realised in his own person\r\nthat terrible and wellwritten scene and at having done accidentally\r\nthough in fact what the mr hyde of fiction had done with deliberate\r\nintent that he ran away as hard as he could go  he was however very\r\nclosely followed and finally he took refuge in a surgery the door of\r\nwhich happened to be open where he explained to a young assistant who\r\nhappened to be there exactly what had occurred  the humanitarian crowd\r\nwere induced to go away on his giving them a small sum of money and as\r\nsoon as the coast was clear he left  as he passed out the name on the\r\nbrass doorplate of the surgery caught his eye  it was jekyll  at\r\nleast it should have beenthe decay of lying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe indispensable east\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat is true about the drama and the novel is no less true about those\r\narts that we call the decorative arts  the whole history of these arts\r\nin europe is the record of the struggle between orientalism with its\r\nfrank rejection of imitation its love of artistic convention its\r\ndislike to the actual representation of any object in nature and our own\r\nimitative spirit  wherever the former has been paramount as in\r\nbyzantium sicily and spain by actual contact or in the rest of europe\r\nby the influence of the crusades we have had beautiful and imaginative\r\nwork in which the visible things of life are transmuted into artistic\r\nconventions and the things that life has not are invented and fashioned\r\nfor her delight  but wherever we have returned to life and nature our\r\nwork has always become vulgar common and uninteresting  modern\r\ntapestry with its aerial effects its elaborate perspective its broad\r\nexpanses of waste sky its faithful and laborious realism has no beauty\r\nwhatsoever  the pictorial glass of germany is absolutely detestable  we\r\nare beginning to weave possible carpets in england but only because we\r\nhave returned to the method and spirit of the east  our rugs and carpets\r\nof twenty years ago with their solemn depressing truths their inane\r\nworship of nature their sordid reproductions of visible objects have\r\nbecome even to the philistine a source of laughter  a cultured\r\nmahomedan once remarked to us you christians are so occupied in\r\nmisinterpreting the fourth commandment that you have never thought of\r\nmaking an artistic application of the second  he was perfectly right\r\nand the whole truth of the matter is this the proper school to learn art\r\nin is not life but artthe decay of lying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe influence of the impressionists on climate\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere if not from the impressionists do we get those wonderful brown\r\nfogs that come creeping down our streets blurring the gaslamps and\r\nchanging the houses into monstrous shadows  to whom if not to them and\r\ntheir master do we owe the lovely silver mists that brood over our\r\nriver and turn to faint forms of fading grace curved bridge and swaying\r\nbarge  the extraordinary change that has taken place in the climate of\r\nlondon during the last ten years is entirely due to a particular school\r\nof art  you smile  consider the matter from a scientific or a\r\nmetaphysical point of view and you will find that i am right  for what\r\nis nature  nature is no great mother who has borne us  she is our\r\ncreation  it is in our brain that she quickens to life  things are\r\nbecause we see them and what we see and how we see it depends on the\r\narts that have influenced us  to look at a thing is very different from\r\nseeing a thing  one does not see anything until one sees its beauty\r\nthen and then only does it come into existence  at present people see\r\nfogs not because there are fogs but because poets and painters have\r\ntaught them the mysterious loveliness of such effects  there may have\r\nbeen fogs for centuries in london  i dare say there were  but no one\r\nsaw them and so we do not know anything about them  they did not exist\r\ntill art had invented them  now it must be admitted fogs are carried\r\nto excess  they have become the mere mannerism of a clique and the\r\nexaggerated realism of their method gives dull people bronchitis  where\r\nthe cultured catch an effect the uncultured catch cold  and so let us\r\nbe humane and invite art to turn her wonderful eyes elsewhere  she has\r\ndone so already indeed  that white quivering sunlight that one sees now\r\nin france with its strange blotches of mauve and its restless violet\r\nshadows is her latest fancy and on the whole nature reproduces it\r\nquite admirably  where she used to give us corots and daubignys she\r\ngives us now exquisite monets and entrancing pissaros  indeed there are\r\nmoments rare it is true but still to be observed from time to time\r\nwhen nature becomes absolutely modern  of course she is not always to be\r\nrelied upon  the fact is that she is in this unfortunate position  art\r\ncreates an incomparable and unique effect and having done so passes on\r\nto other things  nature upon the other hand forgetting that imitation\r\ncan be made the sincerest form of insult keeps on repeating this effect\r\nuntil we all become absolutely wearied of it  nobody of any real\r\nculture for instance ever talks nowadays about the beauty of a sunset\r\nsunsets are quite oldfashioned  they belong to the time when turner was\r\nthe last note in art  to admire them is a distinct sign of provincialism\r\nof temperament  upon the other hand they go onthe decay of lying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan exposure of naturalism\r\n\r\n\r\nafter all what the imitative arts really give us are merely the various\r\nstyles of particular artists or of certain schools of artists  surely\r\nyou dont imagine that the people of the middle ages bore any resemblance\r\nat all to the figures on mediaeval stained glass or in mediaeval stone\r\nand wood carving or on mediaeval metalwork or tapestries or\r\nilluminated mss  they were probably very ordinarylooking people with\r\nnothing grotesque or remarkable or fantastic in their appearance  the\r\nmiddle ages as we know them in art are simply a definite form of style\r\nand there is no reason at all why an artist with this style should not be\r\nproduced in the nineteenth century  no great artist ever sees things as\r\nthey really are  if he did he would cease to be an artist  take an\r\nexample from our own day  i know that you are fond of japanese things\r\nnow do you really imagine that the japanese people as they are\r\npresented to us in art have any existence  if you do you have never\r\nunderstood japanese art at all  the japanese people are the deliberate\r\nselfconscious creation of certain individual artists  if you set a\r\npicture by hokusai or hokkei or any of the great native painters\r\nbeside a real japanese gentleman or lady you will see that there is not\r\nthe slightest resemblance between them  the actual people who live in\r\njapan are not unlike the general run of english people that is to say\r\nthey are extremely commonplace and have nothing curious or extraordinary\r\nabout them  in fact the whole of japan is a pure invention  there is no\r\nsuch country there are no such people  one of our most charming\r\npainters  went recently to the land of the chrysanthemum in the\r\nfoolish hope of seeing the japanese  all he saw all he had the chance\r\nof painting were a few lanterns and some fans  he was quite unable to\r\ndiscover the inhabitants as his delightful exhibition at messrs\r\ndowdeswells gallery showed only too well  he did not know that the\r\njapanese people are as i have said simply a mode of style an exquisite\r\nfancy of art  and so if you desire to see a japanese effect you will\r\nnot behave like a tourist and go to tokio  on the contrary you will\r\nstay at home and steep yourself in the work of certain japanese artists\r\nand then when you have absorbed the spirit of their style and caught\r\ntheir imaginative manner of vision you will go some afternoon and sit in\r\nthe park or stroll down piccadilly and if you cannot see an absolutely\r\njapanese effect there you will not see it anywhere  or to return again\r\nto the past take as another instance the ancient greeks  do you think\r\nthat greek art ever tells us what the greek people were like  do you\r\nbelieve that the athenian women were like the stately dignified figures\r\nof the parthenon frieze or like those marvellous goddesses who sat in\r\nthe triangular pediments of the same building  if you judge from the\r\nart they certainly were so  but read an authority like aristophanes\r\nfor instance  you will find that the athenian ladies laced tightly wore\r\nhighheeled shoes dyed their hair yellow painted and rouged their\r\nfaces and were exactly like any silly fashionable or fallen creature of\r\nour own day  the fact is that we look back on the ages entirely through\r\nthe medium of art and art very fortunately has never once told us the\r\ntruththe decay of lying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthomas griffiths wainewright\r\n\r\n\r\nhe was taken back to newgate preparatory to his removal to the colonies\r\nin a fanciful passage in one of his early essays he had fancied himself\r\nlying in horsemonger gaol under sentence of death for having been\r\nunable to resist the temptation of stealing some marc antonios from the\r\nbritish museum in order to complete his collection  the sentence now\r\npassed on him was to a man of his culture a form of death  he complained\r\nbitterly of it to his friends and pointed out with a good deal of\r\nreason some people may fancy that the money was practically his own\r\nhaving come to him from his mother and that the forgery such as it was\r\nhad been committed thirteen years before which to use his own phrase\r\nwas at least a circonstance attenuante  the permanence of personality\r\nis a very subtle metaphysical problem and certainly the english law\r\nsolves the question in an extremely roughandready manner  there is\r\nhowever something dramatic in the fact that this heavy punishment was\r\ninflicted on him for what if we remember his fatal influence on the\r\nprose of modern journalism was certainly not the worst of all his sins\r\n\r\nwhile he was in gaol dickens macready and hablot browne came across\r\nhim by chance  they had been going over the prisons of london searching\r\nfor artistic effects and in newgate they suddenly caught sight of\r\nwainewright  he met them with a defiant stare forster tells us but\r\nmacready was horrified to recognise a man familiarly known to him in\r\nformer years and at whose table he had dined\r\n\r\nothers had more curiosity and his cell was for some time a kind of\r\nfashionable lounge  many men of letters went down to visit their old\r\nliterary comrade  but he was no longer the kind lighthearted janus whom\r\ncharles lamb admired  he seems to have grown quite cynical\r\n\r\nto the agent of an insurance company who was visiting him one afternoon\r\nand thought he would improve the occasion by pointing out that after\r\nall crime was a bad speculation he replied sir you city men enter on\r\nyour speculations and take the chances of them  some of your\r\nspeculations succeed some fail  mine happen to have failed yours\r\nhappen to have succeeded  that is the only difference sir between my\r\nvisitor and me  but sir i will tell you one thing in which i have\r\nsucceeded to the last  i have been determined through life to hold the\r\nposition of a gentleman  i have always done so  i do so still  it is\r\nthe custom of this place that each of the inmates of a cell shall take\r\nhis mornings turn of sweeping it out  i occupy a cell with a bricklayer\r\nand a sweep but they never offer me the broom  when a friend\r\nreproached him with the murder of helen abercrombie he shrugged his\r\nshoulders and said yes it was a dreadful thing to do but she had very\r\nthick anklespen pencil and poison\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwainewright at hobart town\r\n\r\n\r\nhis love of art however never deserted him  at hobart town he started\r\na studio and returned to sketching and portraitpainting and his\r\nconversation and manners seem not to have lost their charm  nor did he\r\ngive up his habit of poisoning and there are two cases on record in\r\nwhich he tried to make away with people who had offended him  but his\r\nhand seems to have lost its cunning  both of his attempts were complete\r\nfailures and in  being thoroughly dissatisfied with tasmanian\r\nsociety he presented a memorial to the governor of the settlement sir\r\njohn eardley wilmot praying for a ticketofleave  in it he speaks of\r\nhimself as being tormented by ideas struggling for outward form and\r\nrealisation barred up from increase of knowledge and deprived of the\r\nexercise of profitable or even of decorous speech  his request\r\nhowever was refused and the associate of coleridge consoled himself by\r\nmaking those marvellous paradis artificiels whose secret is only known\r\nto the eaters of opium  in  he died of apoplexy his sole living\r\ncompanion being a cat for which he had evinced at extraordinary\r\naffection\r\n\r\nhis crimes seem to have had an important effect upon his art  they gave\r\na strong personality to his style a quality that his early work\r\ncertainly lacked  in a note to the life of dickens forster mentions\r\nthat in  lady blessington received from her brother major power who\r\nheld a military appointment at hobart town an oil portrait of a young\r\nlady from his clever brush and it is said that he had contrived to put\r\nthe expression of his own wickedness into the portrait of a nice kind\r\nhearted girl  m zola in one of his novels tells us of a young man\r\nwho having committed a murder takes to art and paints greenish\r\nimpressionist portraits of perfectly respectable people all of which\r\nbear a curious resemblance to his victim  the development of mr\r\nwainewrights style seems to me far more subtle and suggestive  one can\r\nfancy an intense personality being created out of sinpen pencil and\r\npoison\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncardinal newman and the autobiographers\r\n\r\n\r\nin literature mere egotism is delightful  it is what fascinates us in\r\nthe letters of personalities so different as cicero and balzac flaubert\r\nand berlioz byron and madame de sevigne  whenever we come across it\r\nand strangely enough it is rather rare we cannot but welcome it and\r\ndo not easily forget it  humanity will always love rousseau for having\r\nconfessed his sins not to a priest but to the world and the couchant\r\nnymphs that cellini wrought in bronze for the castle of king francis the\r\ngreen and gold perseus even that in the open loggia at florence shows\r\nthe moon the dead terror that once turned life to stone have not given\r\nit more pleasure than has that autobiography in which the supreme\r\nscoundrel of the renaissance relates the story of his splendour and his\r\nshame  the opinions the character the achievements of the man matter\r\nvery little  he may be a sceptic like the gentle sieur de montaigne or\r\na saint like the bitter son of monica but when he tells us his own\r\nsecrets he can always charm our ears to listening and our lips to\r\nsilence  the mode of thought that cardinal newman representedif that\r\ncan be called a mode of thought which seeks to solve intellectual\r\nproblems by a denial of the supremacy of the intellectmay not cannot\r\ni think survive  but the world will never weary of watching that\r\ntroubled soul in its progress from darkness to darkness  the lonely\r\nchurch at littlemore where the breath of the morning is damp and\r\nworshippers are few will always be dear to it and whenever men see the\r\nyellow snapdragon blossoming on the wall of trinity they will think of\r\nthat gracious undergraduate who saw in the flowers sure recurrence a\r\nprophecy that he would abide for ever with the benign mother of his\r\ndaysa prophecy that faith in her wisdom or her folly suffered not to\r\nbe fulfilled  yes autobiography is irresistiblethe critic as\r\nartist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrobert browning\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken as a whole the man was great  he did not belong to the olympians\r\nand had all the incompleteness of the titan  he did not survey and it\r\nwas but rarely that he could sing  his work is marred by struggle\r\nviolence and effort and he passed not from emotion to form but from\r\nthought to chaos  still he was great  he has been called a thinker\r\nand was certainly a man who was always thinking and always thinking\r\naloud but it was not thought that fascinated him but rather the\r\nprocesses by which thought moves  it was the machine he loved not what\r\nthe machine makes  the method by which the fool arrives at his folly was\r\nas dear to him as the ultimate wisdom of the wise  so much indeed did\r\nthe subtle mechanism of mind fascinate him that he despised language or\r\nlooked upon it as an incomplete instrument of expression  rhyme that\r\nexquisite echo which in the muses hollow hill creates and answers its\r\nown voice rhyme which in the hands of the real artist becomes not\r\nmerely a material element of metrical beauty but a spiritual element of\r\nthought and passion also waking a new mood it may be or stirring a\r\nfresh train of ideas or opening by mere sweetness and suggestion of\r\nsound some golden door at which the imagination itself had knocked in\r\nvain rhyme which can turn mans utterance to the speech of gods rhyme\r\nthe one chord we have added to the greek lyre became in robert\r\nbrownings hands a grotesque misshapen thing which at times made him\r\nmasquerade in poetry as a low comedian and ride pegasus too often with\r\nhis tongue in his cheek  there are moments when he wounds us by\r\nmonstrous music  nay if he can only get his music by breaking the\r\nstrings of his lute he breaks them and they snap in discord and no\r\nathenian tettix making melody from tremulous wings lights on the ivory\r\nhorn to make the movement perfect or the interval less harsh  yet he\r\nwas great and though he turned language into ignoble clay he made from\r\nit men and women that live  he is the most shakespearian creature since\r\nshakespeare  if shakespeare could sing with myriad lips browning could\r\nstammer through a thousand mouths  even now as i am speaking and\r\nspeaking not against him but for him there glides through the room the\r\npageant of his persons  there creeps fra lippo lippi with his cheeks\r\nstill burning from some girls hot kiss  there stands dread saul with\r\nthe lordly malesapphires gleaming in his turban  mildred tresham is\r\nthere and the spanish monk yellow with hatred and blougram and ben\r\nezra and the bishop of st praxeds  the spawn of setebos gibbers in\r\nthe corner and sebald hearing pippa pass by looks on ottimas haggard\r\nface and loathes her and his own sin and himself  pale as the white\r\nsatin of his doublet the melancholy king watches with dreamy treacherous\r\neyes too loyal strafford pass forth to his doom and andrea shudders as\r\nhe hears the cousins whistle in the garden and bids his perfect wife go\r\ndown  yes browning was great  and as what will he be remembered  as a\r\npoet  ah not as a poet  he will be remembered as a writer of fiction\r\nas the most supreme writer of fiction it may be that we have ever had\r\nhis sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled and if he could not\r\nanswer his own problems he could at least put problems forth and what\r\nmore should an artist do  considered from the point of view of a creator\r\nof character he ranks next to him who made hamlet  had he been\r\narticulate he might have sat beside him  the only man who can touch the\r\nhem of his garment is george meredith  meredith is a prose browning and\r\nso is browning he used poetry as a medium for writing in prosethe\r\ncritic as artist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe two supreme and highest arts\r\n\r\n\r\nlife and literature life and the perfect expression of life  the\r\nprinciples of the former as laid down by the greeks we may not realise\r\nin an age so marred by false ideals as our own  the principles of the\r\nlatter as they laid them down are in many cases so subtle that we can\r\nhardly understand them  recognising that the most perfect art is that\r\nwhich most fully mirrors man in all his infinite variety they elaborated\r\nthe criticism of language considered in the light of the mere material\r\nof that art to a point to which we with our accentual system of\r\nreasonable or emotional emphasis can barely if at all attain studying\r\nfor instance the metrical movements of a prose as scientifically as a\r\nmodern musician studies harmony and counterpoint and i need hardly say\r\nwith much keener aesthetic instinct  in this they were right as they\r\nwere right in all things  since the introduction of printing and the\r\nfatal development of the habit of reading amongst the middle and lower\r\nclasses of this country there has been a tendency in literature to\r\nappeal more and more to the eye and less and less to the ear which is\r\nreally the sense which from the standpoint of pure art it should seek\r\nto please and by whose canons of pleasure it should abide always  even\r\nthe work of mr pater who is on the whole the most perfect master of\r\nenglish prose now creating amongst us is often far more like a piece of\r\nmosaic than a passage in music and seems here and there to lack the\r\ntrue rhythmical life of words and the fine freedom and richness of effect\r\nthat such rhythmical life produces  we in fact have made writing a\r\ndefinite mode of composition and have treated it as a form of elaborate\r\ndesign  the greeks upon the other hand regarded writing simply as a\r\nmethod of chronicling  their test was always the spoken word in its\r\nmusical and metrical relations  the voice was the medium and the ear\r\nthe critic  i have sometimes thought that the story of homers blindness\r\nmight be really an artistic myth created in critical days and serving\r\nto remind us not merely that the great poet is always a seer seeing\r\nless with the eyes of the body than he does with the eyes of the soul\r\nbut that he is a true singer also building his song out of music\r\nrepeating each line over and over again to himself till he has caught the\r\nsecret of its melody chaunting in darkness the words that are winged\r\nwith light  certainly whether this be so or not it was to his\r\nblindness as an occasion if not as a cause that englands

of immortality\r\n\r\n\r\non the mouldering citadel of troy lies the lizard like a thing of green\r\nbronze  the owl has built her nest in the palace of priam  over the\r\nempty plain wander shepherd and goatherd with their flocks and where on\r\nthe winesurfaced oily sea greek text as homer calls it\r\ncopperprowed and streaked with vermilion the great galleys of the\r\ndanaoi came in their gleaming crescent the lonely tunnyfisher sits in\r\nhis little boat and watches the bobbing corks of his net  yet every\r\nmorning the doors of the city are thrown open and on foot or in horse\r\ndrawn chariot the warriors go forth to battle and mock their enemies\r\nfrom behind their iron masks  all day long the fight rages and when\r\nnight comes the torches gleam by the tents and the cresset burns in the\r\nhall  those who live in marble or on painted panel know of life but a\r\nsingle exquisite instant eternal indeed in its beauty but limited to\r\none note of passion or one mood of calm  those whom the poet makes live\r\nhave their myriad emotions of joy and terror of courage and despair of\r\npleasure and of suffering  the seasons come and go in glad or saddening\r\npageant and with winged or leaden feet the years pass by before them\r\nthey have their youth and their manhood they are children and they grow\r\nold  it is always dawn for st helena as veronese saw her at the\r\nwindow  through the still morning air the angels bring her the symbol of\r\ngods pain  the cool breezes of the morning lift the gilt threads from\r\nher brow  on that little hill by the city of florence where the lovers\r\nof giorgione are lying it is always the solstice of noon of noon made\r\nso languorous by summer suns that hardly can the slim naked girl dip into\r\nthe marble tank the round bubble of clear glass and the long fingers of\r\nthe luteplayer rest idly upon the chords  it is twilight always for the\r\ndancing nymphs whom corot set free among the silver poplars of france  in\r\neternal twilight they move those frail diaphanous figures whose\r\ntremulous white feet seem not to touch the dewdrenched grass they tread\r\non  but those who walk in epos drama or romance see through the\r\nlabouring months the young moons wax and wane and watch the night from\r\nevening unto morning star and from sunrise unto sunsetting can note the\r\nshifting day with all its gold and shadow  for them as for us the\r\nflowers bloom and wither and the earth that greentressed goddess as\r\ncoleridge calls her alters her raiment for their pleasure  the statue\r\nis concentrated to one moment of perfection  the image stained upon the\r\ncanvas possesses no spiritual element of growth or change  if they know\r\nnothing of death it is because they know little of life for the secrets\r\nof life and death belong to those and those only whom the sequence of\r\ntime affects and who possess not merely the present but the future and\r\ncan rise or fall from a past of glory or of shame  movement that\r\nproblem of the visible arts can be truly realised by literature alone\r\nit is literature that shows us the body in its swiftness and the soul in\r\nits unrestthe critic as artist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe critic and his material\r\n\r\n\r\nwho cares whether mr ruskins views on turner are sound or not  what\r\ndoes it matter  that mighty and majestic prose of his so fervid and so\r\nfierycoloured in its noble eloquence so rich in its elaborate symphonic\r\nmusic so sure and certain at its best in subtle choice of word and\r\nepithet is at least as great a work of art as any of those wonderful\r\nsunsets that bleach or rot on their corrupted canvases in englands\r\ngallery greater indeed one is apt to think at times not merely because\r\nits equal beauty is more enduring but on account of the fuller variety\r\nof its appeal soul speaking to soul in those longcadenced lines not\r\nthrough form and colour alone though through these indeed completely\r\nand without loss but with intellectual and emotional utterance with\r\nlofty passion and with loftier thought with imaginative insight and\r\nwith poetic aim greater i always think even as literature is the\r\ngreater art  who again cares whether mr pater has put into the\r\nportrait of monna lisa something that lionardo never dreamed of  the\r\npainter may have been merely the slave of an archaic smile as some have\r\nfancied but whenever i pass into the cool galleries of the palace of the\r\nlouvre and stand before that strange figure set in its marble chair in\r\nthat cirque of fantastic rocks as in some faint light under sea i\r\nmurmur to myself she is older than the rocks among which she sits like\r\nthe vampire she has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the\r\ngrave and has been a diver in deep seas and keeps their fallen day\r\nabout her and trafficked for strange webs with eastern merchants and\r\nas leda was the mother of helen of troy and as st anne the mother of\r\nmary and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes\r\nand lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing\r\nlineaments and tinged the eyelids and the hands  and i say to my\r\nfriend the presence that thus so strangely rose beside the waters is\r\nexpressive of what in the ways of a thousand years man had come to\r\ndesire and he answers me hers is the head upon which all the ends of\r\nthe world are come and the eyelids are a little weary\r\n\r\nand so the picture becomes more wonderful to us than it really is and\r\nreveals to us a secret of which in truth it knows nothing and the\r\nmusic of the mystical prose is as sweet in our ears as was that flute\r\nplayers music that lent to the lips of la gioconda those subtle and\r\npoisonous curves  do you ask me what lionardo would have said had any\r\none told him of this picture that all the thoughts and experience of the\r\nworld had etched and moulded therein that which they had of power to\r\nrefine and make expressive the outward form the animalism of greece the\r\nlust of rome the reverie of the middle age with its spiritual ambition\r\nand imaginative loves the return of the pagan world the sins of the\r\nborgias  he would probably have answered that he had contemplated none\r\nof these things but had concerned himself simply with certain\r\narrangements of lines and masses and with new and curious\r\ncolourharmonies of blue and green  and it is for this very reason that\r\nthe criticism which i have quoted is criticism of the highest kind  it\r\ntreats the work of art simply as a startingpoint for a new creation  it\r\ndoes not confine itselflet us at least suppose so for the momentto\r\ndiscovering the real intention of the artist and accepting that as final\r\nand in this it is right for the meaning of any beautiful created thing\r\nis at least as much in the soul of him who looks at it as it was in\r\nhis soul who wrought it  nay it is rather the beholder who lends to the\r\nbeautiful thing its myriad meanings and makes it marvellous for us and\r\nsets it in some new relation to the age so that it becomes a vital\r\nportion of our lives and a symbol of what we pray for or perhaps of\r\nwhat having prayed for we fear that we may receivethe critic as\r\nartist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndante the living guide\r\n\r\n\r\nthere is no mood or passion that art cannot give us and those of us who\r\nhave discovered her secret can settle beforehand what our experiences are\r\ngoing to be  we can choose our day and select our hour  we can say to\r\nourselves tomorrow at dawn we shall walk with grave virgil through\r\nthe valley of the shadow of death and lo the dawn finds us in the\r\nobscure wood and the mantuan stands by our side  we pass through the\r\ngate of the legend fatal to hope and with pity or with joy behold the\r\nhorror of another world  the hypocrites go by with their painted faces\r\nand their cowls of gilded lead  out of the ceaseless winds that drive\r\nthem the carnal look at us and we watch the heretic rending his flesh\r\nand the glutton lashed by the rain  we break the withered branches from\r\nthe tree in the grove of the harpies and each dullhued poisonous twig\r\nbleeds with red blood before us and cries aloud with bitter cries  out\r\nof a horn of fire odysseus speaks to us and when from his sepulchre of\r\nflame the great ghibelline rises the pride that triumphs over the\r\ntorture of that bed becomes ours for a moment  through the dim purple\r\nair fly those who have stained the world with the beauty of their sin\r\nand in the pit of loathsome disease dropsystricken and swollen of body\r\ninto the semblance of a monstrous lute lies adamo di brescia the coiner\r\nof false coin  he bids us listen to his misery we stop and with dry\r\nand gaping lips he tells us how he dreams day and night of the brooks of\r\nclear water that in cool dewy channels gush down the green casentine\r\nhills  sinon the false greek of troy mocks at him  he smites him in\r\nthe face and they wrangle  we are fascinated by their shame and\r\nloiter till virgil chides us and leads us away to that city turreted by\r\ngiants where great nimrod blows his horn  terrible things are in store\r\nfor us and we go to meet them in dantes raiment and with dantes heart\r\nwe traverse the marshes of the styx and argenti swims to the boat\r\nthrough the slimy waves  he calls to us and we reject him  when we\r\nhear the voice of his agony we are glad and virgil praises us for the\r\nbitterness of our scorn  we tread upon the cold crystal of cocytus in\r\nwhich traitors stick like straws in glass  our foot strikes against the\r\nhead of bocca  he will not tell us his name and we tear the hair in\r\nhandfuls from the screaming skull  alberigo prays us to break the ice\r\nupon his face that he may weep a little  we pledge our word to him and\r\nwhen he has uttered his dolorous tale we deny the word that we have\r\nspoken and pass from him such cruelty being courtesy indeed for who\r\nmore base than he who has mercy for the condemned of god  in the jaws of\r\nlucifer we see the man who sold christ and in the jaws of lucifer the\r\nmen who slew caesar  we tremble and come forth to rebehold the\r\nstarsthe critic as artist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe limitations of genius\r\n\r\n\r\nthe appeal of all art is simply to the artistic temperament  art does\r\nnot address herself to the specialist  her claim is that she is\r\nuniversal and that in all her manifestations she is one  indeed so far\r\nfrom its being true that the artist is the best judge of art a really\r\ngreat artist can never judge of other peoples work at all and can\r\nhardly in fact judge of his own  that very concentration of vision\r\nthat makes a man an artist limits by its sheer intensity his faculty of\r\nfine appreciation  the energy of creation hurries him blindly on to his\r\nown goal  the wheels of his chariot raise the dust as a cloud around\r\nhim  the gods are hidden from each other  they can recognise their\r\nworshippers  that is all    wordsworth saw in endymion merely a\r\npretty piece of paganism and shelley with his dislike of actuality was\r\ndeaf to wordsworths message being repelled by its form and byron that\r\ngreat passionate human incomplete creature could appreciate neither the\r\npoet of the cloud nor the poet of the lake and the wonder of keats was\r\nhidden from him  the realism of euripides was hateful to sophokles\r\nthose droppings of warm tears had no music for him  milton with his\r\nsense of the grand style could not understand the method of shakespeare\r\nany more than could sir joshua the method of gainsborough  bad artists\r\nalways admire each others work  they call it being largeminded and\r\nfree from prejudice  but a truly great artist cannot conceive of life\r\nbeing shown or beauty fashioned under any conditions other than those\r\nthat he has selected  creation employs all its critical faculty within\r\nits own sphere  it may not use it in the sphere that belongs to others\r\nit is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is the proper judge\r\nof itthe critic as artist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwanted a new background\r\n\r\n\r\nhe who would stir us now by fiction must either give us an entirely new\r\nbackground or reveal to us the soul of man in its innermost workings\r\nthe first is for the moment being done for us by mr rudyard kipling  as\r\none turns over the pages of his plain tales from the hills one feels\r\nas if one were seated under a palmtree reading life by superb flashes of\r\nvulgarity  the bright colours of the bazaars dazzle ones eyes  the\r\njaded secondrate angloindians are in exquisite incongruity with their\r\nsurroundings  the mere lack of style in the storyteller gives an odd\r\njournalistic realism to what he tells us  from the point of view of\r\nliterature mr kipling is a genius who drops his aspirates  from the\r\npoint of view of life he is a reporter who knows vulgarity better than\r\nany one has ever known it  dickens knew its clothes and its comedy  mr\r\nkipling knows its essence and its seriousness  he is our first authority\r\non the secondrate and has seen marvellous things through keyholes and\r\nhis backgrounds are real works of art  as for the second condition we\r\nhave had browning and meredith is with us  but there is still much to\r\nbe done in the sphere of introspection  people sometimes say that\r\nfiction is getting too morbid  as far as psychology is concerned it has\r\nnever been morbid enough  we have merely touched the surface of the\r\nsoul that is all  in one single ivory cell of the brain there are\r\nstored away things more marvellous and more terrible than even they have\r\ndreamed of who like the author of le rouge et le noir have sought to\r\ntrack the soul into its most secret places and to make life confess its\r\ndearest sins  still there is a limit even to the number of untried\r\nbackgrounds and it is possible that a further development of the habit\r\nof introspection may prove fatal to that creative faculty to which it\r\nseeks to supply fresh material  i myself am inclined to think that\r\ncreation is doomed  it springs from too primitive too natural an\r\nimpulse  however this may be it is certain that the subjectmatter at\r\nthe disposal of creation is always diminishing while the subjectmatter\r\nof criticism increases daily  there are always new attitudes for the\r\nmind and new points of view  the duty of imposing form upon chaos does\r\nnot grow less as the world advances  there was never a time when\r\ncriticism was more needed than it is now  it is only by its means that\r\nhumanity can become conscious of the point at which it has arrivedthe\r\ncritic as artist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout frontiers\r\n\r\n\r\ngoetheyou will not misunderstand what i saywas a german of the\r\ngermans  he loved his countryno man more so  its people were dear to\r\nhim and he led them  yet when the iron hoof of napoleon trampled upon\r\nvineyard and cornfield his lips were silent  how can one write songs\r\nof hatred without hating he said to eckermann and how could i to\r\nwhom culture and barbarism are alone of importance hate a nation which\r\nis among the most cultivated of the earth and to which i owe so great a\r\npart of my own cultivation  this note sounded in the modern world by\r\ngoethe first will become i think the starting point for the\r\ncosmopolitanism of the future  criticism will annihilate\r\nraceprejudices by insisting upon the unity of the human mind in the\r\nvariety of its forms  if we are tempted to make war upon another nation\r\nwe shall remember that we are seeking to destroy an element of our own\r\nculture and possibly its most important element  as long as war is\r\nregarded as wicked it will always have its fascination  when it is\r\nlooked upon as vulgar it will cease to be popular  the change will of\r\ncourse be slow and people will not be conscious of it  they will not\r\nsay we will not war against france because her prose is perfect but\r\nbecause the prose of france is perfect they will not hate the land\r\nintellectual criticism will bind europe together in bonds far closer than\r\nthose that can be forged by shopman or sentimentalist  it will give us\r\nthe peace that springs from understandingthe critic as

julia\r\ndaughter of claudius  on opening the coffer they found within its\r\nmarble womb the body of a beautiful girl of about fifteen years of age\r\npreserved by the embalmers skill from corruption and the decay of time\r\nher eyes were half open her hair rippled round her in crisp curling\r\ngold and from her lips and cheek the bloom of maidenhood had not yet\r\ndeparted  borne back to the capitol she became at once the centre of a\r\nnew cult and from all parts of the city crowded pilgrims to worship at\r\nthe wonderful shrine till the pope fearing lest those who had found the\r\nsecret of beauty in a pagan tomb might forget what secrets judaeas rough\r\nand rockhewn sepulchre contained had the body conveyed away by night\r\nand in secret buried  legend though it may be yet the story is none the\r\nless valuable as showing us the attitude of the renaissance towards the\r\nantique world  archaeology to them was not a mere science for the\r\nantiquarian it was a means by which they could touch the dry dust of\r\nantiquity into the very breath and beauty of life and fill with the new\r\nwine of romanticism forms that else had been old and outworn  from the\r\npulpit of niccola pisano down to mantegnas triumph of caesar and the\r\nservice cellini designed for king francis the influence of this spirit\r\ncan be traced nor was it confined merely to the immobile artsthe arts\r\nof arrested movementbut its influence was to be seen also in the great\r\ngraecoroman masques which were the constant amusement of the gay courts\r\nof the time and in the public pomps and processions with which the\r\ncitizens of big commercial towns were wont to greet the princes that\r\nchanced to visit them pageants by the way which were considered so\r\nimportant that large prints were made of them and publisheda fact which\r\nis a proof of the general interest at the time in matters of such\r\nkindthe truth of masks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe art of archaeology\r\n\r\n\r\nindeed archaeology is only really delightful when transfused into some\r\nform of art  i have no desire to underrate the services of laborious\r\nscholars but i feel that the use keats made of lemprieres dictionary is\r\nof far more value to us than professor max mullers treatment of the same\r\nmythology as a disease of language  better endymion than any theory\r\nhowever sound or as in the present instance unsound of an epidemic\r\namong adjectives  and who does not feel that the chief glory of\r\npiranesis book on vases is that it gave keats the suggestion for his\r\node on a grecian urn  art and art only can make archaeology\r\nbeautiful and the theatric art can use it most directly and most\r\nvividly for it can combine in one exquisite presentation the illusion of\r\nactual life with the wonder of the unreal world  but the sixteenth\r\ncentury was not merely the age of vitruvius it was the age of vecellio\r\nalso  every nation seems suddenly to have become interested in the dress\r\nof its neighbours  europe began to investigate its own clothes and the\r\namount of books published on national costumes is quite extraordinary  at\r\nthe beginning of the century the nuremberg chronicle with its two\r\nthousand illustrations reached its fifth edition and before the century\r\nwas over seventeen editions were published of munsters cosmography\r\nbesides these two books there were also the works of michael colyns of\r\nhans weigel of amman and of vecellio himself all of them well\r\nillustrated some of the drawings in vecellio being probably from the\r\nhand of titian\r\n\r\nnor was it merely from books and treatises that they acquired their\r\nknowledge  the development of the habit of foreign travel the increased\r\ncommercial intercourse between countries and the frequency of diplomatic\r\nmissions gave every nation many opportunities of studying the various\r\nforms of contemporary dress  after the departure from england for\r\ninstance of the ambassadors from the czar the sultan and the prince of\r\nmorocco henry the eighth and his friends gave several masques in the\r\nstrange attire of their visitors  later on london saw perhaps too\r\noften the sombre splendour of the spanish court and to elizabeth came\r\nenvoys from all lands whose dress shakespeare tells us had an\r\nimportant

rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination for him\r\nand in his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many merchants\r\nsome to traffic for amber with the rough fisherfolk of the north seas\r\nsome to egypt to look for that curious green turquoise which is found\r\nonly in the tombs of kings and is said to possess magical properties\r\nsome to persia for silken carpets and painted pottery and others to\r\nindia to buy gauze and stained ivory moonstones and bracelets of jade\r\nsandalwood and blue enamel and shawls of fine wool\r\n\r\nbut what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his\r\ncoronation the robe of tissued gold and the rubystudded crown and the\r\nsceptre with its rows and rings of pearls  indeed it was of this that\r\nhe was thinking tonight as he lay back on his luxurious couch watching\r\nthe great pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth\r\nthe designs which were from the hands of the most famous artists of the\r\ntime had been submitted to him many months before and he had given\r\norders that the artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out\r\nand that the whole world was to be searched for jewels that would be\r\nworthy of their work  he saw himself in fancy standing at the high altar\r\nof the cathedral in the fair raiment of a king and a smile played and\r\nlingered about his boyish lips and lit up with a bright lustre his dark\r\nwoodland eyes\r\n\r\nafter some time he rose from his seat and leaning against the carved\r\npenthouse of the chimney looked round at the dimlylit room  the walls\r\nwere hung with rich tapestries representing the triumph of beauty  a\r\nlarge press inlaid with agate and lapislazuli filled one corner and\r\nfacing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels\r\nof powdered and mosaiced gold on which were placed some delicate goblets\r\nof venetian glass and a cup of darkveined onyx  pale poppies were\r\nbroidered on the silk coverlet of the bed as though they had fallen from\r\nthe tired hands of sleep and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the\r\nvelvet canopy from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang like\r\nwhite foam to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling  a laughing\r\nnarcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its head  on the\r\ntable stood a flat bowl of amethyst\r\n\r\noutside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral looming like a\r\nbubble over the shadowy houses and the weary sentinels pacing up and\r\ndown on the misty terrace by the river  far away in an orchard a\r\nnightingale was singing  a faint perfume of jasmine came through the\r\nopen window  he brushed his brown curls back from his forehead and\r\ntaking up a lute let his fingers stray across the cords  his heavy\r\neyelids drooped and a strange languor came over him  never before had\r\nhe felt so keenly or with such exquisite joy the magic and the mystery\r\nof beautiful things\r\n\r\nwhen midnight sounded from the clocktower he touched a bell and his\r\npages entered and disrobed him with much ceremony pouring rosewater\r\nover his hands and strewing flowers on his pillow  a few moments after\r\nthat they had left the room he fell asleepthe young king\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na coronation\r\n\r\n\r\nand when the bishop had heard them he knit his brows and said my son\r\ni am an old man and in the winter of my days and i know that many evil\r\nthings are done in the wide world  the fierce robbers come down from the\r\nmountains and carry off the little children and sell them to the moors\r\nthe lions lie in wait for the caravans and leap upon the camels  the\r\nwild boar roots up the corn in the valley and the foxes gnaw the vines\r\nupon the hill  the pirates lay waste the seacoast and burn the ships of\r\nthe fishermen and take their nets from them  in the saltmarshes live\r\nthe lepers they have houses of wattled reeds and none may come nigh\r\nthem  the beggars wander through the cities and eat their food with the\r\ndogs  canst thou make these things not to be  wilt thou take the leper\r\nfor thy bedfellow and set the beggar at thy board  shall the lion do\r\nthy bidding and the wild boar obey thee  is not he who made misery\r\nwiser than thou art  wherefore i praise thee not for this that thou hast\r\ndone but i bid thee ride back to the palace and make thy face glad and\r\nput on the raiment that beseemeth a king and with the crown of gold i\r\nwill crown thee and the sceptre of pearl will i place in thy hand  and\r\nas for thy dreams think no more of them  the burden of this world is\r\ntoo great for one man to bear and the worlds sorrow too heavy for one\r\nheart to suffer\r\n\r\nsayest thou that in this house said the young king and he strode past\r\nthe bishop and climbed up the steps of the altar and stood before the\r\nimage of christ\r\n\r\nhe stood before the image of christ and on his right hand and on his\r\nleft were the marvellous vessels of gold the chalice with the yellow\r\nwine and the vial with the holy oil  he knelt before the image of\r\nchrist and the great candles burned brightly by the jewelled shrine and\r\nthe smoke of the incense curled in thin blue wreaths through the dome  he\r\nbowed his head in prayer and the priests in their stiff copes crept away\r\nfrom the altar\r\n\r\nand suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside and in entered\r\nthe nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes and shields of polished\r\nsteel  where is this dreamer of dreams they cried  where is this\r\nking who is apparelled like a beggarthis boy who brings shame upon our\r\nstate  surely we will slay him for he is unworthy to rule over us\r\n\r\nand the young king bowed his head again and prayed and when he had\r\nfinished his prayer he rose up and turning round he looked at them\r\nsadly\r\n\r\nand lo through the painted windows came the sunlight streaming upon him\r\nand the sunbeams wove round him a tissued robe that was fairer than the\r\nrobe that had been fashioned for his pleasure  the dead staff blossomed\r\nand bare lilies that were whiter than pearls  the dry thorn blossomed\r\nand bare roses that were redder than rubies  whiter than fine pearls\r\nwere the lilies and their stems were of bright silver  redder than male\r\nrubies were the roses and their leaves were of beaten gold\r\n\r\nhe stood there in the raiment of a king and the gates of the jewelled\r\nshrine flew open and from the crystal of the manyrayed monstrance shone\r\na marvellous and mystical light  he stood there in a kings raiment and\r\nthe glory of god filled the place and the saints in their carven niches\r\nseemed to move  in the fair raiment of a king he stood before them and\r\nthe organ pealed out its music and the trumpeters blew upon their\r\ntrumpets and the singing boys sang\r\n\r\nand the people fell upon their knees in awe and the nobles sheathed\r\ntheir swords and did homage and the bishops face grew pale and his\r\nhands trembled  a greater than i hath crowned thee he cried and he\r\nknelt before him\r\n\r\nand the young king came down from the high altar and passed home through\r\nthe midst of the people  but no man dared look upon his face for it was\r\nlike the face of an angelthe young king\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe king of spain\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom a window in the palace the sad melancholy king watched them  behind\r\nhim stood his brother don pedro of aragon whom he hated and his\r\nconfessor the grand inquisitor of granada sat by his side  sadder even\r\nthan usual was the king for as he looked at the infanta bowing with\r\nchildish gravity to the assembling counters or laughing behind her fan\r\nat the grim duchess of albuquerque who always accompanied her he thought\r\nof the young queen her mother who but a short time beforeso it seemed\r\nto himhad come from the gay country of france and had withered away in\r\nthe sombre splendour of the spanish court dying just six months after\r\nthe birth of her child and before she had seen the almonds blossom twice\r\nin the orchard or plucked the second years fruit from the old gnarled\r\nfigtree that stood in the centre of the now grassgrown courtyard  so\r\ngreat had been his love for her that he had not suffered even the grave\r\nto hide her from him  she had been embalmed by a moorish physician who\r\nin return for this service had been granted his life which for heresy\r\nand suspicion of magical practices had been already forfeited men said\r\nto the holy office and her body was still lying on its tapestried bier\r\nin the black marble chapel of the palace just as the monks had borne her\r\nin on that windy march day nearly twelve years before  once every month\r\nthe king wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled lantern in his hand\r\nwent in and knelt by her side calling out mi reina  mi reina and\r\nsometimes breaking through the formal etiquette that in spain governs\r\nevery separate action of life and sets limits even to the sorrow of a\r\nking he would clutch at the pale jewelled hands in a wild agony of\r\ngrief and try to wake by his mad kisses the cold painted face\r\n\r\ntoday he seemed to see her again as he had seen her first at the castle\r\nof fontainebleau when he was but fifteen years of age and she still\r\nyounger  they had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the papal\r\nnuncio in the presence of the french king and all the court and he had\r\nreturned to the escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow\r\nhair and the memory of two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand\r\nas he stepped into his carriage  later on had followed the marriage\r\nhastily performed at burgos a small town on the frontier between the two\r\ncountries and the grand public entry into madrid with the customary\r\ncelebration of high mass at the church of la atocha and a more than\r\nusually solemn autodafe in which nearly three hundred heretics\r\namongst whom were many englishmen had been delivered over to the secular\r\narm to be burned\r\n\r\ncertainly he had loved her madly and to the ruin many thought of his\r\ncountry then at war with england for the possession of the empire of the\r\nnew world  he had hardly ever permitted her to be out of his sight for\r\nher he had forgotten or seemed to have forgotten all grave affairs of\r\nstate and with that terrible blindness that passion brings upon its\r\nservants he had failed to notice that the elaborate ceremonies by which\r\nhe sought to please her did but aggravate the strange malady from which\r\nshe suffered  when she died he was for a time like one bereft of\r\nreason  indeed there is no doubt but that he would have formally\r\nabdicated and retired to the great trappist monastery at granada of\r\nwhich he was already titular prior had he not been afraid to leave the\r\nlittle infanta at the mercy of his brother whose cruelty even in spain\r\nwas notorious and who was suspected by many of having caused the queens\r\ndeath by means of a pair of poisoned gloves that he had presented to her\r\non the occasion of her visiting his castle in aragon  even after the\r\nexpiration of the three years of public mourning that he had ordained\r\nthroughout his whole dominions by royal edict he would never suffer his\r\nministers to speak about any new alliance and when the emperor himself\r\nsent to him and offered him the hand of the lovely archduchess of\r\nbohemia his niece in marriage he bade the ambassadors tell their\r\nmaster that the king of spain was already wedded to sorrow and that\r\nthough she was but a barren bride he loved her better than beauty an\r\nanswer that cost his crown the rich provinces of the netherlands which\r\nsoon after at the emperors instigation revolted against him under the\r\nleadership of some fanatics of the reformed churchthe birthday of the\r\ninfranta\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na bull fight\r\n\r\n\r\na procession of noble boys fantastically dressed as toreadors came\r\nout to meet her and the young count of tierranueva a wonderfully\r\nhandsome lad of about fourteen years of age uncovering his head with all\r\nthe grace of a born hidalgo and grandee of spain led her solemnly in to\r\na little gilt and ivory chair that was placed on a raised dais above the\r\narena  the children grouped themselves all round fluttering their big\r\nfans and whispering to each other and don pedro and the grand inquisitor\r\nstood laughing at the entrance  even the duchessthe camereramayor as\r\nshe was calleda thin hardfeatured woman with a yellow ruff did not\r\nlook quite so badtempered as usual and something like a chill smile\r\nflitted across her wrinkled face and twitched her thin bloodless lips\r\n\r\nit certainly was a marvellous bullfight and much nicer the infanta\r\nthought than the real bullfight that she had been brought to see at\r\nseville on the occasion of the visit of the duke of parma to her father\r\nsome of the boys pranced about on richlycaparisoned hobbyhorses\r\nbrandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands attached\r\nto them others went on foot waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull\r\nand vaulting lightly over the barrier when he charged them and as for\r\nthe bull himself he was just like a live bull though he was only made\r\nof wickerwork and stretched hide and sometimes insisted on running\r\nround the arena on his hind legs which no live bull ever dreams of\r\ndoing  he made a splendid fight of it too and the children got so\r\nexcited that they stood up upon the benches and waved their lace\r\nhandkerchiefs and cried out bravo toro  bravo toro just as\r\nsensibly as if they had been grownup people  at last however after a\r\nprolonged combat during which several of the hobbyhorses were gored\r\nthrough and through and their riders dismounted the young count of\r\ntierranueva brought the bull to his knees and having obtained\r\npermission from the infanta to give the coup de grace he plunged his\r\nwooden sword into the neck of the animal with such violence that the head\r\ncame right off and disclosed the laughing face of little monsieur de\r\nlorraine the son of the french ambassador at madrid\r\n\r\nthe arena was then cleared amidst much applause and the dead\r\nhobbyhorses dragged solemnly away by two moorish pages in yellow and\r\nblack liveries and after a short interlude during which a french\r\nposturemaster performed upon the tightrope some italian puppets\r\nappeared in the semiclassical tragedy of sophonisba on the stage of a\r\nsmall theatre that had been built up for the purpose  they acted so\r\nwell and their gestures were so extremely natural that at the close of\r\nthe play the eyes of the infanta were quite dim with tears  indeed some\r\nof the children really cried and had to be comforted with sweetmeats\r\nand the grand inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not help\r\nsaying to don pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made\r\nsimply out of wood and coloured wax and worked mechanically by wires\r\nshould be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunesthe\r\nbirthday of the infanta\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe throne room\r\n\r\n\r\nit was a throneroom used for the reception of foreign ambassadors when\r\nthe king which of late had not been often consented to give them a\r\npersonal audience the same room in which many years before envoys had\r\nappeared from england to make arrangements for the marriage of their\r\nqueen then one of the catholic sovereigns of europe with the emperors\r\neldest son  the hangings were of gilt cordovan leather and a heavy gilt\r\nchandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the\r\nblack and white ceiling  underneath a great canopy of gold cloth on\r\nwhich the lions and towers of castile were broidered in seed pearls\r\nstood the throne itself covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded\r\nwith silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls  on\r\nthe second step of the throne was placed the kneelingstool of the\r\ninfanta with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue and below that\r\nagain and beyond the limit of the canopy stood the chair for the papal\r\nnuncio who alone had the right to be seated in the kings presence on\r\nthe occasion of any public ceremonial and whose cardinals hat with its\r\ntangled scarlet tassels lay on a purple tabouret in front  on the\r\nwall facing the throne hung a lifesized portrait of charles v in\r\nhunting dress with a great mastiff by his side and a picture of philip\r\nii receiving the homage of the netherlands occupied the centre of the\r\nother wall  between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet inlaid with\r\nplates of ivory on which the figures from holbeins dance of death had\r\nbeen gravedby the hand some said of that famous master himself\r\n\r\nbut the little dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence  he would\r\nnot have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy nor one white\r\npetal of his rose for the throne itself  what he wanted was to see the\r\ninfanta before she went down to the pavilion and to ask her to come away\r\nwith him when he had finished his dance  here in the palace the air\r\nwas close and heavy but in the forest the wind blew free and the\r\nsunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside\r\nthere were flowers too in the forest not so splendid perhaps as the\r\nflowers in the garden but more sweetly scented for all that hyacinths\r\nin early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool glens and\r\ngrassy knolls yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round the\r\ngnarled roots of the oaktrees bright celandine and blue speedwell and\r\nirises lilac and gold  there were grey catkins on the hazels and the\r\nfoxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled beehaunted cells  the\r\nchestnut had its spires of white stars and the hawthorn its pallid moons\r\nof beauty  yes surely she would come if he could only find her  she\r\nwould come with him to the fair forest and all day long he would dance\r\nfor her delight  a smile lit up his eyes at the thought and he passed\r\ninto the next room\r\n\r\nof all the rooms this was the brightest and the most beautiful  the\r\nwalls were covered with a pinkflowered lucca damask patterned with\r\nbirds and dotted with dainty blossoms of silver the furniture was of\r\nmassive silver festooned with florid wreaths and swinging cupids in\r\nfront of the two large fireplaces stood great screens broidered with\r\nparrots and peacocks and the floor which was of seagreen onyx seemed\r\nto stretch far away into the distance  nor was he alone  standing under\r\nthe shadow of the doorway at the extreme end of the room he saw a\r\nlittle figure watching him  his heart trembled a cry of joy broke from\r\nhis lips and he moved out into the sunlight  as he did so the figure\r\nmoved out also and he saw it plainlythe birthday of the infanta\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na protected country\r\n\r\n\r\nthe kings of each city levied tolls on us but would not suffer us to\r\nenter their gates  they threw us bread over the walls little\r\nmaizecakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled with dates  for\r\nevery hundred baskets we gave them a bead of amber\r\n\r\nwhen the dwellers in the villages saw us coming they poisoned the wells\r\nand fled to the hillsummits  we fought with the magadae who are born\r\nold and grow younger and younger every year and die when they are\r\nlittle children and with the laktroi who say that they are the sons of\r\ntigers and paint themselves yellow and black and with the aurantes who\r\nbury their dead on the tops of trees and themselves live in dark caverns\r\nlest the sun who is their god should slay them and with the krimnians\r\nwho worship a crocodile and give it earrings of green glass and feed it\r\nwith butter and fresh fowls and with the agazonbae who are dogfaced\r\nand with the sibans who have horses feet and run more swiftly than\r\nhorses  a third of our company died in battle and a third died of want\r\nthe rest murmured against me and said that i had brought them an evil\r\nfortune  i took a horned adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me\r\nwhen they saw that i did not sicken they grew afraid\r\n\r\nin the fourth month we reached the city of illel  it was nighttime\r\nwhen we came to the grove that is outside the walls and the air was\r\nsultry for the moon was travelling in scorpion  we took the ripe\r\npomegranates from the trees and brake them and drank their sweet\r\njuices  then we lay down on our carpets and waited for the dawn\r\n\r\nand at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city  it was wrought\r\nout of red bronze and carved with seadragons and dragons that have\r\nwings  the guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our\r\nbusiness  the interpreter of the caravan answered that we had come from\r\nthe island of syria with much merchandise  they took hostages and told\r\nus that they would open the gate to us at noon and bade us tarry till\r\nthen\r\n\r\nwhen it was noon they opened the gate and as we entered in the people\r\ncame crowding out of the houses to look at us and a crier went round the\r\ncity crying through a shell  we stood in the marketplace and the\r\nnegroes uncorded the bales of figured cloths and opened the carved chests\r\nof sycamore  and when they had ended their task the merchants set forth\r\ntheir strange wares the waxed linen from egypt and the painted linen\r\nfrom the country of the ethiops the purple sponges from tyre and the\r\nblue hangings from sidon the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of\r\nglass and the curious vessels of burnt clay  from the roof of a house a\r\ncompany of women watched us  one of them wore a mask of gilded leather\r\n\r\nand on the first day the priests came and bartered with us and on the\r\nsecond day came the nobles and on the third day came the craftsmen and\r\nthe slaves  and this is their custom with all merchants as long as they\r\ntarry in the city\r\n\r\nand we tarried for a moon and when the moon was waning i wearied and\r\nwandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of\r\nits god  the priests in their yellow robes moved silently through the\r\ngreen trees and on a pavement of black marble stood the rosered house\r\nin which the god had his dwelling  its doors were of powdered lacquer\r\nand bulls and peacocks were wrought on them in raised and polished gold\r\nthe tilted roof was of seagreen porcelain and the jutting eaves were\r\nfestooned with little bells  when the white doves flew past they struck\r\nthe bells with their wings and made them tinkle\r\n\r\nin front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with veined onyx\r\ni lay down beside it and with my pale fingers i touched the broad\r\nleaves  one of the priests came towards me and stood behind me  he had\r\nsandals on his feet one of soft serpentskin and the other of birds\r\nplumage  on his head was a mitre of black felt decorated with silver\r\ncrescents  seven yellows were woven into his robe and his frizzed hair\r\nwas stained with antimony\r\n\r\nafter a little while he spake to me and asked me my desire\r\n\r\ni told him that my desire was to see the godthe fisherman and his\r\nsoul\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe blackmailing of the emperor\r\n\r\n\r\nas soon as the man was dead the emperor turned to me and when he had\r\nwiped away the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin of purfled\r\nand purple silk he said to me art thou a prophet that i may not harm\r\nthee or the son of a prophet that i can do thee no hurt  i pray thee\r\nleave my city tonight for while thou art in it i am no longer its\r\nlord\r\n\r\nand i answered him i will go for half of thy treasure  give me half\r\nof thy treasure and i will go away\r\n\r\nhe took me by the hand and led me out into the garden  when the\r\ncaptain of the guard saw me he wondered  when the eunuchs saw me their\r\nknees shook and they fell upon the ground in fear\r\n\r\nthere is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry\r\nand a brasssealed ceiling hung with lamps  the emperor touched one of\r\nthe walls and it opened and we passed down a corridor that was lit with\r\nmany torches  in niches upon each side stood great winejars filled to\r\nthe brim with silver pieces  when we reached the centre of the corridor\r\nthe emperor spake the word that may not be spoken and a granite door\r\nswung back on a secret spring and he put his hands before his face lest\r\nhis eyes should be dazzled\r\n\r\nthou couldst not believe how marvellous a place it was  there were huge\r\ntortoiseshells full of pearls and hollowed moonstones of great size\r\npiled up with red rubies  the gold was stored in coffers of elephant\r\nhide and the golddust in leather bottles  there were opals and\r\nsapphires the former in cups of crystal and the latter in cups of jade\r\nround green emeralds were ranged in order upon thin plates of ivory and\r\nin one corner were silk bags filled some with turquoisestones and\r\nothers with beryls  the ivory horns were heaped with purple amethysts\r\nand the horns of brass with chalcedonies and sards  the pillars which\r\nwere of cedar were hung with strings of yellow lynxstones  in the flat\r\noval shields there were carbuncles both winecoloured and coloured like\r\ngrass  and yet i have told thee but a tithe of what was there\r\n\r\nand when the emperor had taken away his hands from before his face he\r\nsaid to me this is my house of treasure and half that is in it is\r\nthine even as i promised to thee  and i will give thee camels and camel\r\ndrivers and they shall do thy bidding and take thy share of the treasure\r\nto whatever part of the world thou desirest to go  and the thing shall\r\nbe done tonight for i would not that the sun who is my father should\r\nsee that there is in my city a man whom i cannot slay\r\n\r\nbut i answered him the gold that is here is thine and the silver also\r\nis thine and thine are the precious jewels and the things of price  as\r\nfor me i have no need of these  nor shall i take aught from thee but\r\nthat little ring that thou wearest on the finger of thy hand\r\n\r\nand the emperor frowned  it is but a ring of lead he cried nor has\r\nit any value  therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my\r\ncity\r\n\r\nnay i answered but i will take nought but that leaden ring for i\r\nknow what is written within it and for what purpose\r\n\r\nand the emperor trembled and besought me and said take all the\r\ntreasure and go from my city  the half that is mine shall be thine\r\nalso\r\n\r\nand i did a strange thing but what i did matters not for in a cave\r\nthat is but a days journey from this place have i hidden the ring of\r\nriches  it is but a days journey from this place and it waits for thy\r\ncoming  he who has this ring is richer than all the kings of the world\r\ncome therefore and take it and the worlds riches shall be

giant web of sombre\r\nstreets and it was bright dawn when he found himself at last in\r\npiccadilly circus  as he strolled home towards belgrave square he met\r\nthe great waggons on their way to covent garden  the whitesmocked\r\ncarters with their pleasant sunburnt faces and coarse curly hair strode\r\nsturdily on cracking their whips and calling out now and then to each\r\nother on the back of a huge grey horse the leader of a jangling team\r\nsat a chubby boy with a bunch of primroses in his battered hat keeping\r\ntight hold of the mane with his little hands and laughing and the great\r\npiles of vegetables looked like masses of jade against the morning sky\r\nlike masses of green jade against the pink petals of some marvellous\r\nrose  lord arthur felt curiously affected he could not tell why  there\r\nwas something in the dawns delicate loveliness that seemed to him\r\ninexpressibly pathetic and he thought of all the days that break in\r\nbeauty and that set in storm  these rustics too with their rough\r\ngoodhumoured voices and their nonchalant ways what a strange london\r\nthey saw  a london free from the sin of night and the smoke of day a\r\npallid ghostlike city a desolate town of tombs  he wondered what they\r\nthought of it and whether they knew anything of its splendour and its\r\nshame of its fierce fierycoloured joys and its horrible hunger of\r\nall it makes and mars from morn to eve  probably it was to them merely a\r\nmart where they brought their fruits to sell and where they tarried for\r\na few hours at most leaving the streets still silent the houses still\r\nasleep  it gave him pleasure to watch them as they went by  rude as\r\nthey were with their heavy hobnailed shoes and their awkward gait\r\nthey brought a little of a

to\r\nwear pretty things but everybody is so radical and irreligious nowadays\r\nthat it is difficult to make them see that they should not try and dress\r\nlike the upper classes  i am sure i dont know what we are coming to  as\r\npapa has often said in his sermons we live in an age of unbelief\r\n\r\nwe have had great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papa last\r\nthursday  it arrived in a wooden box from london carriage paid and\r\npapa feels it must have been sent by some one who had read his remarkable\r\nsermon is licence liberty for on the top of the clock was a figure of\r\na woman with what papa said was the cap of liberty on her head  i\r\ndidnt think it very becoming myself but papa said it was historical so\r\ni suppose it is all right  parker unpacked it and papa put it on the\r\nmantelpiece in the library and we were all sitting there on friday\r\nmorning when just as the clock struck twelve we heard a whirring noise\r\na little puff of smoke came from the pedestal of the figure and the\r\ngoddess of liberty fell off and broke her nose on the fender  maria was\r\nquite alarmed but it looked so ridiculous that james and i went off\r\ninto fits of laughter and even papa was amused  when we examined it we\r\nfound it was a sort of alarum clock and that if you set it to a\r\nparticular hour and put some gunpowder and a cap under a little hammer\r\nit went off whenever you wanted  papa said it must not remain in the\r\nlibrary as it made a noise so reggie carried it away to the schoolroom\r\nand does nothing but have small explosions all day long  do you think\r\narthur would like one for a wedding present  i suppose they are quite\r\nfashionable in london  papa says they should do a great deal of good as\r\nthey show that liberty cant last but must fall down  papa says liberty\r\nwas invented at the time of the french revolution  how awful it seems\r\n\r\ni have now to go to the dorcas where i will read them your most\r\ninstructive letter  how true dear aunt your idea is that in their\r\nrank of life they should wear what is unbecoming  i must say it is\r\nabsurd their anxiety about dress when there are so many more important\r\nthings in this world and in the next  i am so glad your flowered poplin\r\nturned out so well and that your lace was not torn  i am wearing my\r\nyellow satin that you so kindly gave me at the bishops on wednesday\r\nand think it will look all right  would you have bows or not  jennings\r\nsays that every one wears bows now and that the underskirt should be\r\nfrilled  reggie has just had another explosion and papa has ordered the\r\nclock to be sent to the stables  i dont think papa likes it so much as\r\nhe did at first though he is very flattered at being sent such a pretty\r\nand ingenious toy  it shows that people read his sermons and profit by\r\nthem\r\n\r\npapa sends his love in which james and reggie and maria all unite\r\nand hoping that uncle cecils gout

with the light\r\nhearted gaiety of schoolboys were evidently amusing themselves before\r\nthey retired to rest but at a quarter past eleven all was still and as\r\nmidnight sounded he sallied forth  the owl beat against the window\r\npanes the raven croaked from the old yewtree and the wind wandered\r\nmoaning round the house like a lost soul but the otis family slept\r\nunconscious of their doom and high above the rain and storm he could\r\nhear the steady snoring of the minister for the united states  he\r\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting with an evil smile on his\r\ncruel wrinkled mouth and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\r\npast the great oriel window where his own arms and those of his murdered\r\nwife were blazoned in azure and gold  on and on he glided like an evil\r\nshadow the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed  once he\r\nthought he heard something call and stopped but it was only the baying\r\nof a dog from the red farm and he went on muttering strange sixteenth\r\ncentury curses and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger in the\r\nmidnight air  finally he reached the corner of the passage that led to\r\nluckless washingtons room  for a moment he paused there the wind\r\nblowing his long grey locks about his head and twisting into grotesque\r\nand fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead mans shroud  then\r\nthe clock struck the quarter and he felt the time was come  he chuckled\r\nto himself and turned the corner but no sooner had he done so than\r\nwith a piteous wail of terror he fell back and hid his blanched face in\r\nhis long bony hands  right in front of him was standing a horrible\r\nspectre motionless as a carven image and monstrous as a madmans dream\r\nits head was bald and burnished its face round and fat and white and\r\nhideous laughter seemed to have writhed its features into an eternal\r\ngrin  from the eyes streamed rays of scarlet light the mouth was a wide\r\nwell of fire and a hideous garment like to his own swathed with its\r\nsilent snows the titan form  on its breast was a placard with strange\r\nwriting in antique characters some scroll of shame it seemed some\r\nrecord of wild sins some awful calendar of crime and with its right\r\nhand it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel\r\n\r\nnever having seen a ghost before he naturally was terribly frightened\r\nand after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom he fled back to\r\nhis room tripping up in his long windingsheet as he sped down the\r\ncorridor and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the ministers jack\r\nboots where it was found in the morning by the butler  once in the\r\nprivacy of his own apartment he flung himself down on a small pallet\r\nbed and hid his face under the clothes  after a time however the\r\nbrave old canterville spirit asserted itself and he determined to go and\r\nspeak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight  accordingly just\r\nas the dawn was touching the hills with silver he returned towards the\r\nspot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom feeling that\r\nafter all two ghosts were better than one and that by the aid of his\r\nnew friend he might safely grapple with the twins  on reaching the\r\nspot however a terrible sight met his gaze  something had evidently\r\nhappened to the spectre for the light had entirely faded from its hollow\r\neyes the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand and it was leaning\r\nup against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable attitude  he rushed\r\nforward and seized it in his arms when to his horror the head slipped\r\noff and rolled on the floor the body assumed a recumbent posture and he\r\nfound himself clasping a white dimity bedcurtain with a sweepingbrush\r\na kitchen cleaver and a hollow turnip lying at his feetthe\r\ncanterville ghost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe garden of death\r\n\r\n\r\nfar away beyond the pinewoods he answered in a low dreamy voice\r\nthere is a little garden  there the grass grows long and deep there\r\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower there the nightingale\r\nsings all night long  all night long he sings and the cold crystal\r\nmoon looks down and the yewtree spreads out its giant arms over the\r\nsleepers\r\n\r\nvirginias eyes grew dim with tears and she hid her face in her hands\r\n\r\nyou mean the garden of death she whispered\r\n\r\nyes death  death must be so beautiful  to lie in the soft brown\r\nearth with the grasses waving above ones head and listen to silence\r\nto have no yesterday and no tomorrow  to forget time to forgive life\r\nto be at peace  you can help me  you can open for me the portals of\r\ndeaths house for love is always with you and love is stronger than\r\ndeath is\r\n\r\nvirginia trembled a cold shudder ran through her and for a few moments\r\nthere was silence  she felt as if she was in a terrible dream\r\n\r\nthen the ghost spoke again and his voice sounded like the sighing of the\r\nwind\r\n\r\nhave you ever read the old prophecy on the library window\r\n\r\noh often cried the little girl looking up i know it quite well  it\r\nis painted in curious black letters and it is difficult to read  there\r\nare only six lines\r\n\r\n   when a golden girl can win\r\n   prayer from out the lips of sin\r\n   when the barren almond bears\r\n   and a little child gives away its tears\r\n   then shall all the house be still\r\n   and peace come to canterville\r\n\r\nbut i dont know what they mean\r\n\r\nthey mean he said sadly that you must weep for me for my sins\r\nbecause i have no tears and pray with me for my soul because i have no\r\nfaith and then if you have always been sweet and good and gentle the\r\nangel of death will have mercy on me  you will see fearful shapes in\r\ndarkness and wicked voices will whisper in your ear but they will not\r\nharm you for against the purity of a little child the powers of hell\r\ncannot prevail\r\n\r\nvirginia made no answer and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as\r\nhe looked down at her bowed golden head  suddenly she stood up very\r\npale and with a strange light in her eyes  i am not afraid she said\r\nfirmly and i will ask the angel to have mercy on you\r\n\r\nhe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy and taking her hand bent\r\nover it with oldfashioned grace and kissed it  his fingers were as cold\r\nas ice and his lips burned like fire but virginia did not falter as he\r\nled her across the dusky room  on the faded green tapestry were\r\nbroidered little huntsmen  they blew their tasselled horns and with\r\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back  go back little virginia\r\nthey cried go back but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly and\r\nshe shut her eyes against them  horrible animals with lizard tails and\r\ngoggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece and murmured\r\nbeware little virginia beware we may never see you again but the\r\nghost glided on more swiftly and virginia did not listen  when they\r\nreached the end of the room he stopped and muttered some words she could\r\nnot understand  she opened her eyes and saw the wall slowly fading away\r\nlike a mist and a great black cavern in front of her  a bitter cold\r\nwind swept round them and she felt something pulling at her dress\r\nquick quick cried the ghost or it will be too late and in a\r\nmoment the wainscoting had closed behind them and the tapestry chamber\r\nwas emptythe canterville ghost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan eton kitcat\r\n\r\n\r\nwell said erskine lighting a cigarette i must begin by telling you\r\nabout cyril graham himself  he and i were at the same house at eton  i\r\nwas a year or two older than he was but we were immense friends and did\r\nall our work and all our play together  there was of course a good\r\ndeal more play than work but i cannot say that i am sorry for that  it\r\nis always an advantage not to have received a sound commercial education\r\nand what i learned in the playing fields at eton has been quite as useful\r\nto me as anything i was taught at cambridge  i should tell you that\r\ncyrils father and mother were both dead  they had been drowned in a\r\nhorrible yachting accident off the isle of wight  his father had been in\r\nthe diplomatic service and had married a daughter the only daughter in\r\nfact of old lord crediton who became cyrils guardian after the death\r\nof his parents  i dont think that lord crediton cared very much for\r\ncyril  he had never really forgiven his daughter for marrying a man who\r\nhad not a title  he was an extraordinary old aristocrat who swore like\r\na costermonger and had the manners of a farmer  i remember seeing him\r\nonce on speechday  he growled at me gave me a sovereign and told me\r\nnot to grow up a damned radical like my father  cyril had very little\r\naffection for him and was only too glad to spend most of his holidays\r\nwith us in scotland  they never really got on together at all  cyril\r\nthought him a bear and he thought cyril effeminate  he was effeminate\r\ni suppose in some things though he was a very good rider and a capital\r\nfencer  in fact he got the foils before he left eton  but he was very\r\nlanguid in his manner and not a little vain of his good looks and had a\r\nstrong objection to football  the two things that really gave him\r\npleasure were poetry and acting  at eton he was always dressing up and\r\nreciting shakespeare and when he went up to trinity he became a member\r\nof the adc his first term  i remember i was always very jealous of\r\nhis acting  i was absurdly devoted to him i suppose because we were so\r\ndifferent in some things  i was a rather awkward weakly lad with huge\r\nfeet and horribly freckled  freckles run in scotch families just as\r\ngout does in english families  cyril used to say that of the two he\r\npreferred the gout but he always set an absurdly high value on personal\r\nappearance and once read a paper before our debating society to prove\r\nthat it was better to be goodlooking than to be good  he certainly was\r\nwonderfully handsome  people who did not like him philistines and\r\ncollege tutors and young men reading for the church used to say that he\r\nwas merely pretty but there was a great deal more in his face than mere\r\nprettiness  i think he was the most splendid creature i ever saw and\r\nnothing could exceed the grace of his movements the charm of his manner\r\nhe fascinated everybody who was worth fascinating and a great many\r\npeople who were not  he was often wilful and petulant and i used to\r\nthink him dreadfully insincere  it was due i think chiefly to his\r\ninordinate desire to please  poor cyril  i told him once that he was\r\ncontented with very cheap triumphs but he only laughed  he was horribly\r\nspoiled  all charming people i fancy are spoiled  it is the secret of\r\ntheir attraction\r\n\r\nhowever i must tell you about cyrils acting  you know that no\r\nactresses are allowed to play at the adc  at least they were not in my\r\ntime  i dont know how it is now  well of course cyril was always\r\ncast for the girls parts and when as you like it was produced he\r\nplayed rosalind  it was a marvellous performance  in fact cyril graham\r\nwas the only perfect rosalind i have ever seen  it would be impossible\r\nto describe to you the beauty the delicacy the refinement of the whole\r\nthing  it made an immense sensation and the horrid little theatre as\r\nit was then was crowded every night  even when i read the play now i\r\ncant help thinking of cyril  it might have been written for him  the\r\nnext term he took his degree and came to london to read for the\r\ndiplomatic  but he never did any work  he spent his days in reading\r\nshakespeares sonnets and his evenings at the theatre  he was of\r\ncourse wild to go on the stage  it was all that i and lord crediton\r\ncould do to prevent him  perhaps if he had gone on the stage he would be\r\nalive now  it is always a silly thing to give advice but to give good\r\nadvice is absolutely

wisdom\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom his childhood he had been as one filled with the perfect knowledge\r\nof god and even while he was yet but a lad many of the saints as well\r\nas certain holy women who dwelt in the free city of his birth had been\r\nstirred to much wonder by the grave wisdom of his answers\r\n\r\nand when his parents had given him the robe and the ring of manhood he\r\nkissed them and left them and went out into the world that he might\r\nspeak to the world about god  for there were at that time many in the\r\nworld who either knew not god at all or had but an incomplete knowledge\r\nof him or worshipped the false gods who dwell in groves and have no care\r\nof their worshippers\r\n\r\nand he set his face to the sun and journeyed walking without sandals as\r\nhe had seen the saints walk and carrying at his girdle a leathern wallet\r\nand a little waterbottle of burnt clay\r\n\r\nand as he walked along the highway he was full of the joy that comes from\r\nthe perfect knowledge of god and he sang praises unto god without\r\nceasing and after a time he reached a strange land in which there were\r\nmany cities\r\n\r\nand he passed through eleven cities  and some of these cities were in\r\nvalleys and others were by the banks of great rivers and others were\r\nset on hills  and in each city he found a disciple who loved him and\r\nfollowed him and a great multitude also of people followed him from each\r\ncity and the knowledge of god spread in the whole land and many of the\r\nrulers were converted and the priests of the temples in which there were\r\nidols found that half of their gain was gone and when they beat upon\r\ntheir drums at noon none or but a few came with peacocks and with\r\nofferings of flesh as had been the custom of the land before his coming\r\n\r\nyet the more the people followed him and the greater the number of his\r\ndisciples the greater became his sorrow  and he knew not why his sorrow\r\nwas so great  for he spake ever about god and out of the fulness of\r\nthat perfect knowledge of god which god had himself given to him\r\n\r\nand one evening he passed out of the eleventh city which was a city of\r\narmenia and his disciples and a great crowd of people followed after\r\nhim and he went up on to a mountain and sat down on a rock that was on\r\nthe mountain and his disciples stood round him and the multitude knelt\r\nin the valley\r\n\r\nand he bowed his head on his hands and wept and said to his soul why\r\nis it that i am full of sorrow and fear and that each of my disciples is\r\nan enemy that walks in the noonday  and his soul answered him and said\r\ngod filled thee with the perfect knowledge of himself and thou hast\r\ngiven this knowledge away to others  the pearl of great price thou hast\r\ndivided and the vesture without seam thou hast parted asunder  he who\r\ngiveth away wisdom robbeth himself  he is as one who giveth his treasure\r\nto a robber  is not god wiser than thou art  who art thou to give away\r\nthe secret that god hath told thee  i was rich once and thou hast made\r\nme poor  once i saw god and now thou hast hidden him from me\r\n\r\nand he wept again for he knew that his soul spake truth to him and that\r\nhe had given to others the perfect knowledge of god and that he was as\r\none clinging to the skirts of god and that his faith was leaving him by\r\nreason of the number of those who believed in him\r\n\r\nand he said to himself i will talk no more about god  he who giveth\r\naway wisdom robbeth himself\r\n\r\nand after the space of some hours his disciples came near him and bowed\r\nthemselves to the ground and said master talk to us about god for\r\nthou hast the perfect knowledge of god and no man save thee hath this\r\nknowledge\r\n\r\nand he answered them and said i will talk to you about all other things\r\nthat are in heaven and on earth but about god i will not talk to you\r\nneither now nor at any time will i talk to you about god\r\n\r\nand they were wroth with him and said to him thou hast led us into the\r\ndesert that we might hearken to thee  wilt thou send us away hungry and\r\nthe great multitude that thou hast made to follow thee\r\n\r\nand he answered them and said i will not talk to you about god\r\n\r\nand the multitude murmured against him and said to him thou hast led us\r\ninto the desert and hast given us no food to eat  talk to us about god\r\nand it will suffice us\r\n\r\nbut he answered them not a word  for he knew that if he spake to them\r\nabout god he would give away his treasure\r\n\r\nand his disciples went away sadly and the multitude of people returned\r\nto their own homes  and many died on the way\r\n\r\nand when he was alone he rose up and set his face to the moon and\r\njourneyed for seven moons speaking to no man nor making any answer  and\r\nwhen the seventh moon had waned he reached that desert which is the\r\ndesert of the great river  and having found a cavern in which a centaur\r\nhad once dwelt he took it for his place of dwelling and made himself a\r\nmat of reeds on which to lie and became a hermit  and every hour the\r\nhermit praised god that he had suffered him to keep some knowledge of him\r\nand of his wonderful greatness\r\n\r\nnow one evening as the hermit was seated before the cavern in which he\r\nhad made his place of dwelling he beheld a young man of evil and\r\nbeautiful face who passed by in mean apparel and with empty hands  every\r\nevening with empty hands the young man passed by and every morning he\r\nreturned with his hands full of purple and pearls  for he was a robber\r\nand robbed the caravans of the merchants\r\n\r\nand the hermit looked at him and pitied him  but he spake not a word\r\nfor he knew that he who speaks a word loses his faith\r\n\r\nand one morning as the young man returned with his hands full of purple\r\nand pearls he stopped and frowned and stamped his foot upon the sand\r\nand said to the hermit why do you look at me ever in this manner as i\r\npass by  what is it that i see in your eyes  for no man has looked at\r\nme before in this manner  and the thing is a thorn and a trouble to me\r\n\r\nand the hermit answered him and said what you see in my eyes is pity\r\npity is what looks out at you from my eyes\r\n\r\nand the young man laughed with scorn and cried to the hermit in a bitter\r\nvoice and said to him i have purple and pearls in my hands and you\r\nhave but a mat of reeds on which to lie  what pity should you have for\r\nme  and for what reason have you this pity\r\n\r\ni have pity for you said the hermit because you have no knowledge of\r\ngod\r\n\r\nis this knowledge of god a precious thing asked the young man and he\r\ncame close to the mouth of the cavern\r\n\r\nit is more precious than all the purple and the pearls of the world\r\nanswered the hermit\r\n\r\nand have you got it said the young robber and he came closer still\r\n\r\nonce indeed answered the hermit i possessed the perfect knowledge\r\nof god  but in my foolishness i parted with it and divided it amongst\r\nothers  yet even now is such knowledge as remains to me more precious\r\nthan purple or pearls\r\n\r\nand when the young robber heard this he threw away the purple and the\r\npearls that he was bearing in his hands and drawing a sharp sword of\r\ncurved steel he said to the hermit give me forthwith this knowledge of\r\ngod that you possess or i will surely slay you  wherefore should i not\r\nslay him who has a treasure greater than my treasure\r\n\r\nand the hermit spread out his arms and said were it not better for me\r\nto go unto the uttermost courts of god and praise him than to live in\r\nthe world and have no knowledge of him  slay me if that be your desire\r\nbut i will not give away my knowledge of god\r\n\r\nand the young robber knelt down and besought him but the hermit would\r\nnot talk to him about god nor give him his treasure and the young\r\nrobber rose up and said to the hermit be it as you will  as for\r\nmyself i will go to the city of the seven sins that is but three days\r\njourney from this place and for my purple they will give me pleasure\r\nand for my pearls they will sell me joy  and he took up the purple and\r\nthe pearls and went swiftly away\r\n\r\nand the hermit cried out and followed him and besought him  for the\r\nspace of three days he followed the young robber on the road and\r\nentreated him to return nor to enter into the city of the seven sins\r\n\r\nand ever and anon the young robber looked back at the hermit and called\r\nto him and said will you give me this knowledge of god which is more\r\nprecious than purple and pearls  if you will give me that i will not\r\nenter the city\r\n\r\nand ever did the hermit answer all things that i have i will give thee\r\nsave that one thing only  for that thing it is not lawful for me to give\r\naway\r\n\r\nand in the twilight of the third day they came nigh to the great scarlet\r\ngates of the city of the seven sins  and from the city there came the\r\nsound of much laughter\r\n\r\nand the young robber laughed in answer and sought to knock at the gate\r\nand as he did so the hermit ran forward and caught him by the skirts of\r\nhis raiment and said to him stretch forth your hands and set your\r\narms around my neck and put your ear close to my lips and i will give\r\nyou what remains to me of the knowledge of god  and the young robber\r\nstopped\r\n\r\nand when the hermit had given away his knowledge of god he fell upon the\r\nground and wept and a great darkness hid from him the city and the young\r\nrobber so that he saw them no more\r\n\r\nand as he lay there weeping he was ware of one who was standing beside\r\nhim and he who was standing beside him had feet of brass and hair like\r\nfine wool  and he raised the hermit up and said to him before this\r\ntime thou hadst the perfect knowledge of god  now thou shalt have the\r\nperfect love of god  wherefore art thou weeping  and he kissed\r\nhimpoems in prose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwilde gives directions about de profundis\r\n\r\n\r\nhm prison reading\r\n\r\napril st \r\n\r\nmy dear robbiei send you a ms separate from this which i hope will\r\narrive safely  as soon as you have read it i want you to have it\r\ncarefully copied for me  there are many causes why i wish this to be\r\ndone  one will suffice  i want you to be my literary executor in case\r\nof my death and to have complete control of my plays books and papers\r\nas soon as i find i have a legal right to make a will i will do so  my\r\nwife does not understand my art nor could be expected to have any\r\ninterest in it and cyril is only a child  so i turn naturally to you\r\nas indeed i do for everything and would like you to have all my works\r\nthe deficit that their sale will produce may be lodged to the credit of\r\ncyril and vivian  well if you are my literary executor you must be in\r\npossession of the only document that gives any explanation of my\r\nextraordinary behaviour    when you have read the letter you will see\r\nthe psychological explanation of a course of conduct that from the\r\noutside seems a combination of absolute idiotcy with vulgar bravado  some\r\nday the truth will have to be knownnot necessarily in my lifetime   \r\nbut i am not prepared to sit in the grotesque pillory they put me into\r\nfor all time for the simple reason that i inherited from my father and\r\nmother a name of high distinction in literature and art and i cannot for\r\neternity allow that name to be degraded  i dont defend my conduct  i\r\nexplain it  also there are in my letter certain passages which deal with\r\nmy mental development in prison and the inevitable evolution of my\r\ncharacter and intellectual attitude towards life that has taken place\r\nand i want you and others who still stand by me and have affection for me\r\nto know exactly in what mood and manner i hope to face the world  of\r\ncourse from one point of view i know that on the day of my release i\r\nshall be merely passing from one prison into another and there are times\r\nwhen the whole world seems to me no larger than my cell and as full of\r\nterror for me  still i believe that at the beginning god made a world\r\nfor each separate man and in that world which is within us we should\r\nseek to live  at any rate you will read those parts of my letter with\r\nless pain than the others  of course i need not remind you how fluid a\r\nthing thought is with mewith us alland of what an evanescent\r\nsubstance are our emotions made  still i do see a sort of possible goal\r\ntowards which through art i may progress  it is not unlikely that you\r\nmay help me\r\n\r\nas regards the mode of copying of course it is too long for any\r\namanuensis to attempt and your own handwriting dear robbie in your\r\nlast letter seems specially designed to remind me that the task is not to\r\nbe yours  i think that the only thing to do is to be thoroughly modern\r\nand to have it typewritten  of course the ms should not pass out of\r\nyour control but could you not get mrs marshall to send down one of her\r\ntypewriting girlswomen are the most reliable as they have no memory\r\nfor the importantto hornton street or phillimore gardens to do it\r\nunder your supervision  i assure you that the typewriting machine when\r\nplayed with expression is not more annoying than the piano when played\r\nby a sister or near relation  indeed many among those most devoted to\r\ndomesticity prefer it  i wish the copy to be done not on tissue paper\r\nbut on good paper such as is used for plays and a wide rubricated margin\r\nshould be left for corrections    if the copy is done at hornton\r\nstreet the lady typewriter might be fed through a lattice in the door\r\nlike the cardinals when they elect a pope till she comes out on the\r\nbalcony and can say to the world habet mundus epistolam for indeed it\r\nis an encyclical letter and as the bulls of the holy father are named\r\nfrom their opening words it may be spoken of as the epistola in\r\ncarcere et vinculis    in point of fact robbie prison life makes\r\none see people and things as they really are  that is why it turns one\r\nto stone  it is the people outside who are deceived by the illusions of\r\na life in constant motion  they revolve with life and contribute to its\r\nunreality  we who are immobile both see and know  whether or not the\r\nletter does good to narrow natures and hectic brains to me it has done\r\ngood  i have cleansed my bosom of much perilous stuff to borrow a\r\nphrase from the poet whom you and i once thought of rescuing from the\r\nphilistines  i need not remind you that mere expression is to an artist\r\nthe supreme and only mode of life  it is by utterance that we live  of\r\nthe many many things for which i have to thank the governor there is\r\nnone for which i am more grateful than for his permission to write fully\r\nand at as great a length as i desire  for nearly two years i had within\r\na growing burden of bitterness of much of which i have now got rid  on\r\nthe other side of the prison wall there are some poor black\r\nsootbesmirched trees that are just breaking out into buds of an almost\r\nshrill green  i know quite well what they are going through  they are\r\nfinding expression\r\n\r\never yours\r\n\r\noscar\r\n\r\nletter from reading prison to robert ross\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarey street\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere there is sorrow there in holy ground  some day people will realise\r\nwhat that means  they will know nothing of life till they doand\r\nnatures like his can realise it  when i was brought down from my prison\r\nto the court of bankruptcy between two policemenwaited in the long\r\ndreary corridor that before the whole crowd whom an action so sweet and\r\nsimple hushed into silence he might gravely raise his hat to me as\r\nhandcuffed and with bowed head i passed him by  men have gone to heaven\r\nfor smaller things than that  it was in this spirit and with this mode\r\nof love that the saints knelt down to wash the feet of the poor or\r\nstooped to kiss the leper on the cheek  i have never said one single\r\nword to him about what he did  i do not know to the present moment\r\nwhether he is aware that i was even conscious of his action  it is not a\r\nthing for which one can render formal thanks in formal words  i store it\r\nin the treasurehouse of my heart  i keep it there as a secret debt that\r\ni am glad to think i can never possibly repay  it is embalmed and kept\r\nsweet by the myrrh and cassia of many tears  when wisdom has been\r\nprofitless to me philosophy barren and the proverbs and phrases of\r\nthose who have sought to give me consolation as dust and ashes in my\r\nmouth the memory of that little lovely silent act of love has unsealed\r\nfor me all the wells of pity made the desert blossom like a rose and\r\nbrought me out of the bitterness of lonely exile into harmony with the\r\nwounded broken and great heart of the world  when people are able to\r\nunderstand not merely how beautiful s action was but why it meant\r\nso much to me and always will mean so much then perhaps they will\r\nrealise how and in what spirit they should approach me   \r\n\r\nthe poor are wise more charitable more kind more sensitive than we\r\nare  in their eyes prison is a tragedy in a mans life a misfortune a\r\ncasuality something that calls for sympathy in others  they speak of\r\none who is in prison as of one who is in trouble simply  it is the\r\nphrase they always use and the expression has the perfect wisdom of love\r\nin it  with people of our own rank it is different  with us prison\r\nmakes a man a pariah  i and such as i am have hardly any right to air\r\nand sun  our presence taints the pleasures of others  we are unwelcome\r\nwhen we reappear  to revisit the glimpses of the moon is not for us  our\r\nvery children are taken away  those lovely links with humanity are\r\nbroken  we are doomed to be solitary while our sons still live  we are\r\ndenied the one thing that might heal us and keep us that might bring\r\nbalm to the bruised heart and peace to the soul in painde\r\nprofundis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsorrow wears no mask\r\n\r\n\r\nsorrow being the supreme emotion of which man is capable is at once the\r\ntype and test of all great art  what the artist is always looking for is\r\nthe mode of existence in which soul and body are one and indivisible in\r\nwhich the outward is expressive of the inward in which form reveals  of\r\nsuch modes of existence there are not a few youth and the arts\r\npreoccupied with youth may serve as a model for us at one moment at\r\nanother we may like to think that in its subtlety and sensitiveness of\r\nimpression its suggestion of a spirit dwelling in external things and\r\nmaking its raiment of earth and air of mist and city alike and in its\r\nmorbid sympathy of its moods and tones and colours modern landscape\r\nart is realising for us pictorially what was realised in such plastic\r\nperfection by the greeks  music in which all subject is absorbed in\r\nexpression and cannot be separated from it is a complex example and a\r\nflower or a child a simple example of what i mean but sorrow is the\r\nultimate type both in life and art\r\n\r\nbehind joy and laughter there may be a temperament coarse hard and\r\ncallous  but behind sorrow there is always sorrow  pain unlike\r\npleasure wears no mask  truth in art is not any correspondence between\r\nthe essential idea and the accidental existence it is not the\r\nresemblance of shape to shadow or of the form mirrored in the crystal to\r\nthe form itself it is no echo coming from a hollow hill any more than\r\nit is a silver well of water in the valley that shows the moon to the\r\nmoon and narcissus to narcissus  truth in art is the unity of a thing\r\nwith itself the outward rendered expressive of the inward the soul made\r\nincarnate the body instinct with spirit  for this reason there is no\r\ntruth comparable to sorrow  there are times when sorrow seems to me to\r\nbe the only truth  other things may be illusions of the eye or the\r\nappetite made to blind the one and cloy the other but out of sorrow\r\nhave the worlds been built and at the birth of a child or a star there\r\nis pain\r\n\r\nmore than this there is about sorrow an intense an extraordinary\r\nreality  i have said of myself that i was one who stood in symbolic\r\nrelations to the art and culture of my age  there is not a single\r\nwretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in\r\nsymbolic relation to the very secret of life  for the secret of life is\r\nsuffering  it is what is hidden behind everything  when we begin to\r\nlive what is sweet is so sweet to us and what is bitter so bitter that\r\nwe inevitably direct all our desires towards pleasures and seek not\r\nmerely for a month or twain to feed on honeycomb but for all our years\r\nto taste no other food ignorant all the while that we may really be\r\nstarving the soulde profundis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvita nuova\r\n\r\n\r\nfar off like a perfect pearl one can see the city of god  it is so\r\nwonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summers day\r\nand so a child could  but with me and such as me it is different  one\r\ncan realise a thing in a single moment but one loses it in the long\r\nhours that follow with leaden feet  it is so difficult to keep heights\r\nthat the soul is competent to gain  we think in eternity but we move\r\nslowly through time and how slowly time goes with us who lie in prison i\r\nneed not tell again nor of the weariness and despair that creep back\r\ninto ones cell and into the cell of ones heart with such strange\r\ninsistence that one has as it were to garnish and sweep ones house for\r\ntheir coming as for an unwelcome guest or a bitter master or a slave\r\nwhose slave it is ones chance or choice to be\r\n\r\nand though at present my friends may find it a hard thing to believe it\r\nis true none the less that for them living in freedom and idleness and\r\ncomfort it is more easy to learn the lessons of humility than it is for\r\nme who begin the day by going down on my knees and washing the floor of\r\nmy cell  for prison life with its endless privations and restrictions\r\nmakes one rebellious  the most terrible thing about it is not that it\r\nbreaks ones hearthearts are made to be brokenbut that it turns ones\r\nheart to stone  one sometimes feels that it is only with a front of\r\nbrass and a lip of scorn that one can get through the day at all  and he\r\nwho is in a state of rebellion cannot receive grace to use the phrase of\r\nwhich the church is so fondso rightly fond i dare sayfor in life as\r\nin art the mood of rebellion closes up the channels of the soul and\r\nshuts out the airs of heaven  yet i must learn these lessons here if i\r\nam to learn them anywhere and must be filled with joy if my feet are on\r\nthe right road and my face set towards the gate which is called\r\nbeautiful though i may fall many times in the mire and often in the\r\nmist go astray\r\n\r\nthis new life as through my love of dante i like sometimes to call it\r\nis of course no new life at all but simply the continuance by means of\r\ndevelopment and evolution of my former life  i remember when i was at\r\noxford saying to one of my friends as we were strolling round magdalens\r\nnarrow birdhaunted walks one morning in the year before i took my\r\ndegree that i wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden\r\nof the world and that i was going out into the world with that passion\r\nin my soul  and so indeed i went out and so i lived  my only mistake\r\nwas that i confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to\r\nme the sunlit side of the garden and shunned the other side for its\r\nshadow and its gloom  failure disgrace poverty sorrow despair\r\nsuffering tears even the broken words that come from lips in pain\r\nremorse that makes one walk on thorns conscience that condemns self\r\nabasement that punishes the misery that puts ashes on its head the\r\nanguish that chooses sackcloth for its raiment and into its own drink\r\nputs gallall these were things of which i was afraid  and as i had\r\ndetermined to know nothing of them i was forced to taste each of them in\r\nturn to feed on them to have for a season indeed no other food at\r\nall\r\n\r\ni dont regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure  i did it\r\nto the full as one should do everything that one does  there was no\r\npleasure i did not experience  i threw the pearl of my soul into a cup\r\nof wine  i went down the primrose path to the sound of flutes  i lived\r\non honeycomb  but to have continued the same life would have been wrong\r\nbecause it would have been limiting  i had to pass on  the other half\r\nof the garden had its secrets for me alsode

the\r\nnearest possible approach to the perfection of god  christ through some\r\ndivine instinct in him seems to have always loved the sinner as being\r\nthe nearest possible approach to the perfection of man  his primary\r\ndesire was not to reform people any more than his primary desire was to\r\na relieve suffering  to turn an interesting thief into a tedious honest\r\nman was not his aim  he would have thought little of the prisoners aid\r\nsociety and other modern movements of the kind  the conversion of a\r\npublican into a pharisee would not have seemed to him a great\r\nachievement  but in a manner not yet understood of the world he regarded\r\nsin and suffering as being in themselves beautiful holy things and modes\r\nof perfection\r\n\r\nit seems a very dangerous idea  it isall great ideas are dangerous\r\nthat it was christs creed admits of no doubt  that it is the true creed\r\ni dont doubt myself\r\n\r\nof course the sinner must repent  but why  simply because otherwise he\r\nwould be unable to realise what he had done  the moment of repentance is\r\nthe moment of initiation  more than that it is the means by which one\r\nalters ones past  the greeks thought that impossible  they often say\r\nin their gnomic aphorisms even the gods cannot alter the past  christ\r\nshowed that the commonest sinner could do it that it was the one thing\r\nhe could do  christ had he been asked would have saidi feel quite\r\ncertain about itthat the moment the prodigal son fell on his knees and\r\nwept he made his having wasted his substance with harlots his swine\r\nherding and hungering for the husks they ate beautiful and holy moments\r\nin his life  it is difficult for most people to grasp the idea  i dare\r\nsay one has to go to prison to understand it  if so it may be worth\r\nwhile going to prison\r\n\r\nthere is something so unique about christ  of course just as there are\r\nfalse dawns before the dawn itself and winter days so full of sudden\r\nsunlight that they will cheat the wise crocus into squandering its gold\r\nbefore its time and make some foolish bird call to its mate to build on\r\nbarren boughs so there were christians before christ  for that we\r\nshould be grateful  the unfortunate thing is that there have been none\r\nsince  i make one exception st francis of assisi  but then god had\r\ngiven him at his birth the soul of a poet as he himself when quite young\r\nhad in mystical marriage taken poverty as his bride and with the soul of\r\na poet and the body of a beggar he found the way to perfection not\r\ndifficult  he understood christ and so he became like him  we do not\r\nrequire the liber conformitatum to teach us that the life of st francis\r\nwas the true imitatio christi a poem compared to which the book of\r\nthat name is merely prose\r\n\r\nindeed that is the charm about christ when all is said he is just like\r\na work of art  he does not really teach one anything but by being\r\nbrought into his presence one becomes something  and everybody is\r\npredestined to his presence  once at least in his life each man walks\r\nwith christ to emmausde

i\r\nremember that i used to say that i thought i could bear a real tragedy if\r\nit came to me with purple pall and a mask of noble sorrow but that the\r\ndreadful thing about modernity was that it put tragedy into the raiment\r\nof comedy so that the great realities seemed commonplace or grotesque or\r\nlacking in style  it is quite true about modernity  it has probably\r\nalways been true

very successfully  palermo where we stayed eight\r\ndays was lovely  the most beautifully situated town in the worldit\r\ndreams away its life in the concha doro the exquisite valley that\r\nlies between two seas  the lemon groves and the orange gardens were so\r\nentirely perfect that i became quite a preraphaelite and loathed the\r\nordinary impressionists whose muddly souls and blurred intelligences\r\nwould have rendered but by mud and blur those golden lamps hung in a\r\ngreen night that filled me with such joy  the elaborate and exquisite\r\ndetail of the true preraphaelite is the compensation they offer us for\r\nthe absence of motion literature and motion being the only arts that are\r\nnot immobile\r\n\r\nthen nowhere not even at ravenna have i seen such mosaics as in the\r\ncapella palatine which from pavement to domed ceiling is all gold one\r\nreally feels as if one was sitting in the heart of a great honeycomb\r\nlooking at angels singing and looking at angels or indeed at people\r\nsinging is much nicer than listening to them for this reason the great\r\nartists always give to their angels lutes without strings pipes without\r\nventholes and reeds through which no wind can wander or make\r\nwhistlings\r\n\r\nmonreale you have heard ofwith its cloisters and cathedral we often\r\ndrove there\r\n\r\ni also made great friends with a young seminarist who lived in the\r\ncathedral of palermohe and eleven others in little rooms beneath the\r\nroof like birds\r\n\r\nevery day he showed me all over the cathedral i knelt before the huge\r\nporphyry sarcophagus in which frederick the second lies it is a sublime\r\nbare monstrous thingbloodcoloured and held up by lions who have\r\ncaught some of the rage of the great emperors restless soul  at first\r\nmy young friend giuseppe loverdi gave me information but on the third\r\nday i gave information to him and rewrote history as usual and told\r\nhim all about the supreme king and his court of poets and the terrible\r\nbook that he never wrote  his reason for entering the church was\r\nsingularly mediaeval  i asked him why he thought of becoming a\r\nclerico and how  he answered my father is a cook and most poor and\r\nwe are many at home so it seemed to me a good thing that there should be\r\nin so small a house as ours one mouth less to feed for though i am\r\nslim i eat much too much alas i fear\r\n\r\ni told him to be comforted because god used poverty often as a means of\r\nbringing people to him and used riches never or rarely so giuseppe was\r\ncomforted and i gave him a little book of devotion very pretty and\r\nwith far more pictures than prayers in itso of great service to\r\ngiuseppe whose eyes are beautiful  i also gave him many lire and\r\nprophesied for him a cardinals hat if he remained very good and never\r\nforgot me\r\n\r\nat naples we stopped three days most of my friends are as you know in\r\nprison but i met some of nice memory\r\n\r\nwe came to rome on holy thursday  h left on saturday for glandand\r\nyesterday to the terror of grissell  and all the papal court i\r\nappeared in the front rank of the pilgrims in the vatican and got the\r\nblessing of the holy fathera blessing they would have denied me\r\n\r\nhe was wonderful as he was carried past me on his thronenot of flesh\r\nand blood but a white soul robed in white and an artist as well as a\r\nsaintthe only instance in history if the newspapers are to be\r\nbelieved  i have seen nothing like the extraordinary grace of his\r\ngestures as he rose from moment to moment to blesspossibly the\r\npilgrims but certainly me\r\n\r\ntree should see him  it is his only chance\r\n\r\ni was deeply impressed and my walkingstick showed signs of budding\r\nwould have budded indeed only at the door of the chapel it was taken\r\nfrom me by the knave of spades  this strange prohibition is of course\r\nin honour of tannhauser\r\n\r\nhow did i get the ticket  by a miracle of course  i thought it was\r\nhopeless and made no effort of any kind  on saturday afternoon at five\r\noclock h and i went to have tea at the hotel de leurope  suddenly\r\nas i was eating buttered toast a manor what seemed to be onedressed\r\nlike a hotel porter entered and asked me would i like to see the pope on\r\neaster day  i bowed my head humbly and said non sum dignus or words\r\nto that effect  he at once produced a ticket\r\n\r\nwhen i tell you that his countenance was of supernatural ugliness and\r\nthat the price of the ticket was thirty pieces of silver i need say no\r\nmore\r\n\r\nan equally curious thing is that whenever i pass the hotel which i do\r\nconstantly i see the same man  scientists call that phenomenon an\r\nobsession of the visual nerve  you and i know better\r\n\r\non the afternoon of easter day i heard vespers at the lateran music\r\nquite lovely  at the close a bishop in red and with red glovessuch\r\nas pater talks of in gaston de latourcame out on the balcony and\r\nshowed us the relics  he was swarthy and wore a yellow mitre  a\r\nsinister mediaeval man but superbly gothic just like the bishops carved\r\non stalls or on portals and when one thinks that once people mocked at\r\nstainedglass attitudes they are the only attitudes for the clothes  the\r\nsight of the bishop whom i watched with fascination filled me with the\r\ngreat sense of the realism of gothic art  neither in greek art nor in\r\ngothic art is there any pose  posing was invented by bad\r\nportraitpainters and the first person who posed was a stockbroker and\r\nhe has gone on posing ever since\r\n\r\ni send you a photograph i took on palm sunday at palermo  do send me\r\nsome of yours and love me always and try to read this
