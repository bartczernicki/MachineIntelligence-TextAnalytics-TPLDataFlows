sledges with the bells--\r\n              Silver bells!\r\nWhat a world of merriment their melody foretells!\r\n       How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,\r\n           In the icy air of night!\r\n       While the stars, that oversprinkle\r\n       All the heavens, seem to twinkle\r\n           With  a crystalline delight;\r\n       Keeping time, time, time,\r\n       In a sort if Runic rhyme,\r\nTo the tintinabulation that so musically wells\r\n    From the bells, bells, bells, bells,\r\n           Bells, bells, bells,--\r\nFrom the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     II.\r\n\r\n       Hear the mellow wedding bells,\r\n              Golden bells!\r\nWhat a world of happiness their harmony foretells!\r\n       Through the balmy air of night\r\n       How they ring out their delight!\r\n         From the molten golden-notes,\r\n             And all in tune,\r\n           What a liquid ditty floats\r\nTo the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats\r\n                On the moon!\r\n       Oh, from out the sounding cells,\r\nWhat a gush of euphony voluminously wells!\r\n                How it swells!\r\n                How it dwells\r\n         On the Future! how it tells\r\n         Of the rapture that impels\r\n     To the swinging and the ringing\r\n       Of the bells, bells, bells,\r\n     Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,\r\n             Bells, bells, bells--\r\nTo the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Bells]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     III.\r\n\r\n       Hear the loud alarum bells--\r\n               Brazen bells!\r\nWhat a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!\r\n    In the startled ear of night\r\n    How they scream out their affright!\r\n      Too much horrified to speak\r\n      They can only shriek, shriek,\r\n             Out of tune,\r\nIn a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,\r\nIn a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,\r\n          Leaping higher, higher, higher,\r\n          With a desperate desire,\r\n       And a resolute endeavour.\r\n       Now--now to sit or never,\r\n     By the side of the pale-faced moon.\r\n          Oh, the bells, bells, bells!\r\n          What a tale their terror tells\r\n              Of Despair!\r\n     How they clang, and clash, and roar!\r\n     What a horror they outpour\r\n     On the bosom of the palpitating air!\r\n            Yet the ear it fully knows,\r\n              By the twanging,\r\n              And the clanging,\r\n            How the danger ebbs and flows:\r\n          Yet the ear distinctly tells,\r\n              In the jangling,\r\n              And the wrangling,\r\n          How the danger sinks and swells,\r\nBy the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells--\r\n                 Of the bells--\r\n          Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,\r\n              Bells, bells, bells--\r\nIn the clamour and the clangour of the bells!\r\n\r\n\r\n                     IV.\r\n\r\n       Hear the tolling of the bells--\r\n              Iron bells!\r\nWhat a world of solemn thought their monody compels!\r\n       In the silence of the night,\r\n       How we shiver with affright\r\n     At the melancholy menace of their tone!\r\n       For every sound that floats\r\n       From the rust within their throats\r\n              Is a groan.\r\n       And the people--ah, the people--\r\n       They that dwell up in the steeple,\r\n              All alone,\r\n       And who, tolling, tolling, tolling,\r\n          In that muffled monotone,\r\n       Feel a glory in so rolling\r\n          On the human heart a stone--\r\n       They are neither man nor woman--\r\n       They are neither brute nor human--\r\n               They are Ghouls:\r\n          And their king it is who tolls;\r\n          And he rolls, rolls, rolls,\r\n              Rolls\r\n            A paean from the bells!\r\n       And his merry bosom swells\r\n          With the paean of the bells!\r\n       And he dances, and he yells;\r\n       Keeping time, time, time,\r\n       In a sort of Runic rhyme,\r\n          To the paean of the bells--\r\n              Of the bells:\r\n       Keeping time, time, time,\r\n       In a sort of Runic rhyme,\r\n          To the throbbing of the bells\r\n       Of the bells, bells, bells--\r\n          To the sobbing of the bells;\r\n       Keeping time, time, time,\r\n          As he knells, knells, knells,\r\n       In a happy Runic rhyme,\r\n          To the rolling of the bells--\r\n       Of the bells, bells, bells:\r\n          To the tolling of the bells,\r\n       Of the bells, bells, bells, bells--\r\n          Bells, bells, bells--\r\n   To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_EULALIE--A SONG_\r\n\r\n\r\n             I dwelt alone\r\n             In a world of moan,\r\n   And my soul was a stagnant tide,\r\nTill the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride--\r\nTill the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.\r\n\r\n             Ah, less--less bright\r\n             The stars of the night\r\n   Than the eyes of the radiant girl!\r\n             And never a flake\r\n             That the vapour can make\r\n   With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,\r\nCan vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curl--\r\nCan compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie’s most humble and careless\r\n      curl.\r\n\r\n             Now doubt--now Pain\r\n             Come never again,\r\n   For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,\r\n             And all day long\r\n             Shines, bright and strong,\r\n   Astarté within the sky,\r\nWhile ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye--\r\nWhile ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Annabel Lee]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ANNABEL LEE_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was many and many a year ago,\r\n     In a kingdom by the sea,\r\nThat a maiden there lived whom you may know\r\n     By the name of ANNABEL LEE;\r\nAnd this maiden she lived with no other thought\r\n     Than to love and be loved by me.\r\n\r\nI was a child and _she_ was a child,\r\n     In this kingdom by the sea;\r\nBut we loved with a love which was more than love--\r\n     I and my Annabel Lee;\r\nWith a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven\r\n     Coveted her and me.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the reason that, long ago,\r\n     In this kingdom by the sea,\r\nA wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\r\nMy beautiful Annabel Lee;\r\nSo that her highborn kinsmen came\r\n     And bore her away from me,\r\nTo shut her up in a sepulchre\r\n     In this kingdom by the sea.\r\n\r\nThe angels, not half so happy in heaven,\r\n     Went envying her and me--\r\nYes!--that was the reason (as all men know,\r\n     In this kingdom by the sea)\r\nThat the wind came out of the cloud by night,\r\n     Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.\r\n\r\nBut our love it was stronger by far than the love\r\n     Of those who were older than we--\r\n     Of many far wiser than we--\r\nAnd neither the angels in heaven above,\r\n     Nor the demons down under the sea,\r\nCan ever dissever my soul from the soul\r\n     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.\r\n\r\nFor the moon never beams without bringing me dreams\r\n     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\r\nAnd the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes\r\n     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\r\nAnd so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\r\nOf my darling--my darling--my life and my bride,\r\n     In her sepulchre there by the sea,\r\n     In her tomb by the sounding sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SONNET--SILENCE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some qualities--some incorporate things,\r\n  That have a double life, which thus is made\r\nA type of that twin entity which springs\r\n  From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.\r\nThere is a two-fold _Silence_--sea and shore--\r\n  Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,\r\n  Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,\r\nSome human memories and tearful lore,\r\nRender him terrorless: his name's \"No More.\"\r\nHe is the corporate Silence: dread him not!\r\n  No power hath he of evil in himself;\r\nBut should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)\r\n  Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,\r\nThat haunteth the lone regions where hath trod\r\nNo foot of man), commend thyself to God!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Silence]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE RAVEN_\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\r\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\r\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\r\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\r\n\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--\r\n            Only this, and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\r\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\r\nEagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow\r\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--\r\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\r\n            Nameless here for evermore.\r\n\r\nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\r\nThrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\r\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,\r\n\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--\r\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--\r\n            This it is, and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\r\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\r\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\r\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\r\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you,\"--here I opened wide the door;--\r\n            Darkness there, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,\r\n      fearing,\r\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;\r\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\r\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"\r\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"--\r\n            Merely this, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\r\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\r\n\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice:\r\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--\r\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--\r\n            'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\r\nIn there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;\r\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\r\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--\r\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--\r\n            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\r\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\r\n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no\r\n      craven,\r\nGhastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore--\r\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\r\n            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\r\nThough its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\r\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\nEver yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door--\r\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\r\n            With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nBut the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\r\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\r\nNothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--\r\nTill I scarcely more than muttered, \"other friends have flown\r\n      before--\r\nOn the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"\r\n            Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\r\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,\r\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\r\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--\r\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\r\n            Of 'Never--nevermore'.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\r\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and\r\n      door;\r\nThen upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\r\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--\r\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore\r\n            Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\r\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\r\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\r\nOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,\r\nBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,\r\n            _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\r\n\r\nThen methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\r\nSwung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.\r\n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath\r\n      sent thee\r\nRespite--respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!\r\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!\"\r\n            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or\r\n      devil!--\r\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\r\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--\r\nOn this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--\r\nIs there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"\r\n            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!\r\nBy that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--\r\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\r\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\r\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\r\n            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,\" I shrieked,\r\n      upstarting--\r\n\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\r\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\r\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!\r\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\r\n            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\r\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\r\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\r\nAnd the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\r\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n            Shall be lifted--nevermore!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Raven]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_TO ONE IN PARADISE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThou wast all that to me, love,\r\n  For which my soul did pine--\r\nA green isle in the sea, love,\r\n  A fountain and a shrine,\r\nAll wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,\r\n  And all the flowers were mine.\r\n\r\nAh, dream to bright to last!\r\n  Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise\r\nBut to be overcast!\r\n  A voice from out the Future cries,\r\n\"On! on!\"--but o'er the Past\r\n  (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies\r\nMute, motionless, aghast!\r\n\r\nFor, alas! alas! with me\r\n  The light of Life is o'er!\r\n\"No more--no more--no more--\"\r\n(Such language holds the solemn sea\r\n  To the sands upon the shore)\r\nShall bloom the thunder-blasted tree\r\n  Or the stricken eagle soar!\r\n\r\nAnd all my days are trances,\r\n  And all my nightly dreams\r\nAre where thy grey eye glances,\r\n  And where thy footstep gleams--\r\nIn what ethereal dances,\r\n  By what eternal streams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: To One in Paradise]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_LENORE_\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!\r\nLet the bell toll!--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;\r\nAnd, Guy de Vere, hast _thou_ no tear?--weep now or nevermore!\r\nSee! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!\r\nCome! let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung!--\r\nAn anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young--\r\nA dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.\r\n\r\n\"Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride.\r\nAnd when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died!\r\nHow _shall_ the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung\r\nBy you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue\r\nThat did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lenore]\r\n\r\n_Peccavimus_; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song\r\nGo up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong\r\nThe sweet Lenore hath \"gone before,\" with Hope, that flew beside,\r\nLeaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy\r\n      bride--\r\nFor her, the fair and _debonair_, that now so lowly lies,\r\nThe life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes--\r\nThe life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Avaunt! avaunt! from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven--\r\nFrom Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven--\r\nFrom grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of Heaven!\r\nLet no bell toll, then,--lest her soul, amid its hallowed mirth,\r\nShould catch the note as it doth float up from

than the cold reality\r\nOf waking life, to him whose heart must be,\r\nAnd hath been still, upon the lovely earth,\r\nA chaos of deep passion, from his birth.\r\nBut should it be--that dream eternally\r\nContinuing--as dreams have been to me\r\nIn my young boyhood--should it thus be given,\r\n'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven.\r\nFor I have revell'd, when the sun was bright\r\nI' the summer sky, in dreams of living light\r\nAnd loveliness,--have left my very heart\r\nIn climes of my imagining, apart\r\nFrom mine own home, with beings that have been\r\nOf mine own thought--what more could I have seen?\r\n'Twas once--and only once--and the wild hour\r\nFrom my remembrance shall not pass--some power\r\nOr spell had bound me--'twas the chilly wind\r\nCame o'er me in the night, and left behind\r\nIts image on my spirit--or the moon\r\nShone on my slumbers in her lofty noon\r\nToo coldly--or the stars--howe'er it was\r\nThat dream was as that night-wind--let it pass.\r\nI _have been_ happy, tho' in a dream.\r\nI have been happy--and I love the theme:\r\nDreams! in their vivid colouring of life,\r\nAs in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife\r\nOf semblance with reality, which brings\r\nTo the delirious eye, more lovely things\r\nOf Paradise and Love--and all our own!\r\nThan young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_TO HELEN_\r\n\r\n[Helen was Mrs. Whitman.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw thee once--once only--years ago:\r\nI must not say _how_ many--but _not_ many.\r\nIt was a July midnight; and from out\r\nA full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,\r\nSought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,\r\nThere fell a silvery-silken veil of light,\r\nWith quietude, and sultriness, and slumber,\r\nUpon the upturned faces of a thousand\r\nRoses that grew in an enchanted garden,\r\nWhere no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--\r\nFell on the upturn'd faces of these roses\r\nThat gave out, in return for the love-light,\r\nTheir odorous souls in an ecstatic death--\r\nFell on the upturn'd faces of these roses\r\nThat smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted\r\nBy thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.\r\n\r\nClad all in white, upon a violet bank\r\nI saw thee half-reclining; while the moon\r\nFell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,\r\nAnd on thine own, upturn'd--alas, in sorrow!\r\n\r\nWas it not Fate, that, on this July midnight--\r\nWas it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,)\r\nThat bade me pause before that garden-gate,\r\nTo breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?\r\nNo footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,\r\nSave only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!--oh, God\r\nHow my heart beats in coupling those two words!)\r\nSave only thee and me. I paused--I looked--\r\nAnd in an instant all things disappeared.\r\n(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)\r\n\r\nThe pearly lustre of the moon went out:\r\nThe mossy banks and the meandering paths,\r\nThe happy flowers and the repining trees,\r\nWere seen no more: the very roses' odours\r\nDied in the arms of the adoring airs.\r\nAll--all expired save thee--save less than thou:\r\nSave only the divine light in thine eyes--\r\nSave but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.\r\nI saw but them--they were the world to me!\r\nI saw but them--saw only them for hours,\r\nSaw only them until the moon went down.\r\nWhat wild heart-histories seemed to lie enwritten\r\nUpon those crystalline, celestial spheres!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: To Helen]\r\n\r\nHow dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope!\r\nHow silently serene a sea of pride!\r\nHow daring an ambition; yet how deep--\r\nHow fathomless a capacity for love!\r\n\r\nBut now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,\r\nInto a western couch of thunder-cloud;\r\nAnd thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees\r\nDidst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained;_\r\nThey _would not_ go--they never yet have gone;\r\nLighting my lonely pathway home that night,\r\n_They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since;\r\nThey follow me--they lead me through the years.\r\nThey are my ministers--yet I their slave.\r\nTheir office is to illumine and enkindle--\r\nMy duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light,\r\nAnd purified in their electric fire,\r\nAnd sanctified in their elysian fire.\r\nThey fill, my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),\r\nAnd are far up in Heaven--the stars I kneel to\r\nIn the sad, silent watches of my night;\r\nWhile even in the meridian glare of day\r\nI see them still--two sweetly scintillant\r\nVenuses, unextinguished by the sun!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE HAUNTED PALACE_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the greenest of our valleys\r\n  By good angels tenanted,\r\nOnce a fair and stately palace--\r\n  Radiant palace--reared its head.\r\nIn the monarch Thought's dominion--\r\n  It stood there!\r\nNever seraph spread a pinion\r\n  Over fabric half so fair!\r\n\r\nBanners yellow, glorious, golden,\r\n  On its roof did float and flow,\r\n(This--all this--was in the olden\r\n  Time long ago,)\r\nAnd every gentle air that dallied,\r\n  In that sweet day,\r\nAlong the ramparts plumed and pallid,\r\n  A wingèd odour went away.\r\n\r\nWanderers in that happy valley,\r\n  Through two luminous windows, saw\r\nSpirits moving musically,\r\n  To a lute's well-tuned law,\r\nRound about a throne where, sitting\r\n  (Porphyrogene!)\r\nIn state his glory well befitting,\r\n  The ruler of the realm was seen.\r\n\r\nAnd all with pearl and ruby glowing\r\n  Was the fair palace door,\r\nThrough which came flowing, flowing, flowing,\r\n  And sparkling evermore,\r\nA troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty\r\n  Was but to sing,\r\nIn voices of surpassing beauty,\r\n  The wit and wisdom of their king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Haunted Palace]\r\n\r\nBut evil things, in robes of sorrow,\r\n  Assailed the monarch's high estate.\r\n(Ah, let us mourn!--for never morrow\r\n  Shall dawn upon him desolate!)\r\nAnd round about his home the glory\r\n  That blushed and bloomed,\r\nIs but a dim-remembered story\r\n  Of the old time entombed.\r\n\r\nAnd travellers, now, within that valley,\r\n  Through the red-litten windows see\r\nVast forms, that move fantastically\r\n  To a discordant melody,\r\nWhile, like a ghastly rapid river,\r\n  Through the pale door\r\nA hideous throng rush out for ever\r\n  And laugh--but smile no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM_\r\n\r\n\r\nTake this kiss upon the brow!\r\nAnd, in parting from you now,\r\nThus much let me avow--\r\nYou are not wrong, who deem\r\nThat my days have been a dream;\r\nYet if hope has flown away\r\nIn a night, or in a day,\r\nIn a vision, or in none,\r\nIs it therefore the less _gone?_\r\n_All_ that we see or seem\r\nIs but a dream within a dream.\r\n\r\nI stand amid the roar\r\nOf a surf-tormented shore,\r\nAnd I hold within my hand\r\nGrains of the golden sand--\r\nHow few! yet how they creep\r\nThrough my fingers to the deep,\r\nWhile I weep--while I weep!\r\nO God! can I not grasp\r\nThem with a tighter clasp?\r\nO God! can I not save\r\n_One_ from the pitiless wave?\r\nIs _all_ that we see or seem\r\nBut a dream within a dream?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE CITY IN THE SEA_\r\n\r\n\r\nLo!

night in the lonesome October\r\n     Of my most immemorial year;\r\nIt was hard by the dim lake of Auber,\r\n     In the misty mid region of Weir--\r\nIt was down by the dank tarn of Auber,\r\n     In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\r\n\r\nHere once, through an alley Titanic,\r\n     Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--\r\n     Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.\r\nThese were days when my heart was volcanic\r\n     As the scoriac rivers that roll--\r\n     As the lavas that restlessly roll\r\nTheir sulphurous currents down Yaanek\r\n     In the ultimate climes of the pole--\r\nThat groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek\r\n     In the realms of the boreal pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ulalume]\r\n\r\nOur talk had been serious and sober,\r\n     But our thoughts they were palsied and sere--\r\n     Our memories were treacherous and sere--\r\nFor we knew not the month was October,\r\n     And we marked not the night of the year--\r\n     (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)\r\nWe noted not the dim lake of Auber--\r\n     (Though once we had journeyed down here),\r\nRemembered not the dank tarn of Auber,\r\n     Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\r\nAnd now, as the night was senescent,\r\n     And star-dials pointed to morn--\r\n     As the star-dials hinted of morn--\r\nAt the end of our path a liquescent\r\n     And nebulous lustre was born,\r\nOut of which a miraculous crescent\r\n     Arose with a duplicate horn--\r\nAstarte's bediamonded crescent\r\n     Distinct with its duplicate horn.\r\n\r\nAnd I said--\"She is warmer than Dian:\r\n     She rolls through an ether of sighs--\r\n     She revels in a region of sighs:\r\nShe has seen that the tears are not dry on\r\n     These cheeks, where the worm never dies,\r\nAnd has come past the stars of the Lion,\r\n     To point us the path to the skies--\r\n     To the Lethean peace of the skies--\r\nCome up, in despite of the Lion,\r\n     To shine on us with her bright eyes--\r\nCome up through the lair of the Lion,\r\n     With love in her luminous eyes.\"\r\n\r\nBut Psyche, uplifting her finger,\r\n     Said--\"Sadly this star I mistrust--\r\n     Her pallor I strangely mistrust:--\r\nOh, hasten!--oh, let us not linger!\r\n     Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.\"\r\nIn terror she spoke, letting sink her\r\n     Wings until they trailed in the dust--\r\nIn agony sobbed, letting sink her\r\n     Plumes till they trailed in the dust--\r\n     Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.\r\n\r\nI replied--\"This is nothing but dreaming:\r\n     Let us on by this tremulous light!\r\n     Let us bathe in this crystalline light!\r\nIts Sybilic splendour is beaming\r\n     With Hope and in Beauty to-night:--\r\n     See!--it flickers up the sky through the night!\r\nAh, we safely may trust to its gleaming,\r\n     And be sure it will lead us aright--\r\nWe safely may trust to a gleaming\r\n     That cannot but guide us aright,\r\n     Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,\r\n     And tempted her out of her gloom--\r\n     And conquered her scruples and gloom;\r\nAnd we passed to the end of the vista,\r\n     But were stopped by the door of a tomb--\r\n     By the door of a legended tomb;\r\nAnd I said--\"What is written, sweet sister,\r\n     On the door of this legended tomb?\"\r\n     She replied--\"Ulalume--Ulalume--\r\n     'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen my heart it grew ashen and sober\r\n     As the leaves that were crisped and sere--\r\n     As the leaves that were withering and sere;\r\nAnd I cried--\"It was surely October\r\n     On _this_ very night of last year\r\n     That I journeyed--I journeyed down here--\r\n     That I brought a dread burden down here--\r\n     On this night of all nights in the year,\r\n     Ah, what demon has tempted me here?\r\nWell I know, now, this dim lake of Auber--\r\n     This misty mid region of Weir--\r\nWell I

To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5.

     While the stars, that oversprinkle\n       All the heavens, seem to twinkle\n           With  a crystalline delight;\n       Keeping time, time, time,\n       In a sort if Runic rhyme,\nTo the tintinabulation that so musically wells\r\nFrom the bells, bells, bells, bells,\n           Bells, bells, bells,--\nFrom the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.\n\n\n                     II.\n\n

     From the molten golden-notes,\n             And all in tune,\r\nWhat a liquid ditty floats\nTo the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats\n                On the moon!\n       Oh, from out the sounding cells,\nWhat a gush of euphony voluminously wells!\n                How it swells!\n                How it dwells\n         On the Future! how it tells\n         Of the rapture that

dances, and he yells;\n       Keeping time, time, time,\n       In a sort of Runic rhyme,","To the paean of the bells--\n              Of the bells:\n       Keeping time, time, time,\n       In a sort of Runic rhyme,\n          To the throbbing of the bells\n       Of the bells, bells, bells--\n          To the sobbing of the bells;\n       Keeping time, time, time,\n          As he knells, knells,

stagnant tide,\nTill the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride--\nTill the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.\r\nAh, less--less bright\n             The stars of the night\n   Than the eyes of the radiant girl!\n             And never a flake\n             That the vapour can make\n   With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,\nCan vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curl--\nCan compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie’s most humble and careless\n      curl.\n\n             Now doubt--now Pain\r\nCome never again,\n   For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,\n             And all day long\n             Shines, bright and strong,\n   Astarté within the sky,\nWhile ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye--\nWhile ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.\n\n[Illustration: Annabel Lee]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_ANNABEL LEE_\n\n\nIt was many and many a year ago,\n     In a kingdom by the sea,\r\nThat a maiden there lived whom you may know\n     By the name of ANNABEL LEE;\nAnd this maiden she lived with no other thought\n     Than to love and be loved by me.\n\nI was a child and _she_ was a child,\n     In this kingdom by the sea;\nBut we loved with a love which was more than love--\n     I and my Annabel Lee;\nWith a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven\n     Coveted her and me.\n\nAnd this was the reason that, long ago,","In this kingdom by the sea,\nA wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\nMy beautiful Annabel Lee;\nSo that her highborn kinsmen came\n     And bore her away from me,\nTo shut her up in a sepulchre\n     In this kingdom by the sea.\n\nThe angels, not half so happy in heaven,\n     Went envying her and me--\nYes!--that was the reason (as all men know,\n     In this kingdom by the sea)\nThat the wind came out of the cloud by night,\r\nChilling and killing my Annabel Lee.\n\nBut our love it was stronger by far than the love\n     Of those who were older than we--\n     Of many far wiser than we--\nAnd neither the angels in heaven above,\n     Nor the demons down under the sea,\nCan ever dissever my soul from the soul\n     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.\n\nFor the moon never beams without bringing me dreams\n     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\r\nAnd the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes\n     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\nAnd so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\nOf my darling--my darling--my life and my bride,\n     In her sepulchre there by the sea,\n     In her tomb by the sounding sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_SONNET--SILENCE_\n\n\nThere are some qualities--some incorporate things,\n  That have a double life, which thus is made\nA type of that twin entity which springs\r\nFrom matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.\nThere is a two-fold _Silence_--sea and shore--\n  Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,\n  Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,\nSome human memories and tearful lore,\nRender him terrorless: his name's \"No More.\"\nHe is the corporate Silence: dread him not!\n  No power hath he of evil in himself;\nBut should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)\r\nBring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,\nThat haunteth the lone regions where hath trod\nNo foot of man), commend thyself to God!\n\n[Illustration: Silence]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_THE RAVEN_\n\n\nOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.","\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--\n            Only this, and nothing more.\"\n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\r\nNameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,\n\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--\n            This it is, and nothing more.\"\r\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you,\"--here I opened wide the door;--\n            Darkness there, and nothing more.\n\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,\r\nfearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"--\n            Merely this, and nothing more.\n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice:\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--\n            'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"\n\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;","Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--\n            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no\r\ncraven,\nGhastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore--\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\n            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door--\r\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n            With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\n\nBut the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--\nTill I scarcely more than muttered, \"other friends have flown\n      before--\nOn the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"\r\nThen the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"\n\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\n            Of 'Never--nevermore'.\"\r\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and\n      door;\nThen upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore\n            Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\n\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing","To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,\nBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,\n            _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\nThen methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.\r\n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath\n      sent thee\nRespite--respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!\"\n            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or\n      devil!--\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\r\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--\nOn this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--\nIs there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"\n            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\r\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\n            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,\" I shrieked,\n      upstarting--\n\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\r\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\n            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;","And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\n            Shall be

October\n     Of my most immemorial year;\nIt was hard by the dim lake of Auber,\r\nIn the misty mid region of Weir--\nIt was down by the dank tarn of Auber,\n     In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\n\nHere once, through an alley Titanic,\n     Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--\n     Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.\nThese were days when my heart was volcanic\n     As the scoriac rivers that roll--\n     As the lavas that restlessly roll\nTheir sulphurous currents down Yaanek\n     In the ultimate climes of the pole--","That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek\n     In the realms of

of morn--\nAt the end of our path a liquescent\n     And nebulous lustre was born,\nOut of which a miraculous crescent\n     Arose with a duplicate horn--\nAstarte's bediamonded crescent\r\nDistinct with its duplicate horn.\n\nAnd I said--\"She is warmer than Dian:\n     She rolls through an ether of sighs--\n     She revels in a region of sighs:\nShe has seen that the tears are not dry on\n

trailed in the dust--\r\nIn agony sobbed, letting sink her\n     Plumes till they trailed in the dust--\n     Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.\n\nI replied--\"This is nothing but dreaming:\n

sea\r\nbut we loved with a love which was more than love\r\n     i and my annabel lee\r\nwith a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven\r\n     coveted her and me\r\n\r\nand this was the reason that long ago\r\n     in this kingdom by the sea\r\na wind blew out of a cloud chilling\r\nmy beautiful annabel lee\r\nso that her highborn kinsmen came\r\n     and bore her away from me\r\nto shut her up in a sepulchre\r\n     in this kingdom by the sea\r\n\r\nthe angels not half so happy in heaven\r\n     went envying her and me\r\nyesthat was the reason as all men know\r\n     in this kingdom by the sea\r\nthat the wind came out of the cloud by night\r\n     chilling and killing my annabel lee\r\n\r\nbut our love it was stronger by far than the love\r\n     of those who were older than we\r\n     of many far wiser than we\r\nand neither the angels in heaven above\r\n     nor the demons down under the sea\r\ncan ever dissever my soul from the soul\r\n     of the beautiful annabel lee\r\n\r\nfor the moon never beams without bringing me dreams\r\n     of the beautiful annabel lee\r\nand the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes\r\n     of the beautiful annabel lee\r\nand so all the

napping suddenly there came a tapping\r\nas of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door\r\ntis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door\r\n            only this and nothing more\r\n\r\nah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december\r\nand each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor\r\neagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow\r\nfrom my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore\r\nfor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore\r\n            nameless here for evermore\r\n\r\nand the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\r\nthrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before\r\nso that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating\r\ntis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door\r\nsome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door\r\n            this it is and nothing more\r\n\r\npresently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer\r\nsir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore\r\nbut the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping\r\nand so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door\r\nthat i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door\r\n            darkness there and nothing more\r\n\r\ndeep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering\r\n      fearing\r\ndoubting dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before\r\nbut the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token\r\nand the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore\r\nthis i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore\r\n            merely this and nothing more\r\n\r\nback into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning\r\nsoon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before\r\nsurely said i surely that is something at my window lattice\r\nlet me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore\r\nlet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore\r\n            tis the wind and nothing more\r\n\r\nopen here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter\r\nin there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore\r\nnot the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he\r\nbut with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door\r\nperched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door\r\n            perched and sat and nothing more\r\n\r\nthen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling\r\nby the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore\r\nthough thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no\r\n      craven\r\nghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore\r\ntell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore\r\n            quoth the raven nevermore\r\n\r\nmuch i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly\r\nthough its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore\r\nfor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\never yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door\r\nbird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door\r\n            with such name as nevermore\r\n\r\nbut the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only\r\nthat one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour\r\nnothing further then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered\r\ntill i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown\r\n      before\r\non the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before\r\n            then the bird said nevermore\r\n\r\nstartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken\r\ndoubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store\r\ncaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster\r\nfollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore\r\ntill the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore\r\n            of nevernevermore\r\n\r\nbut the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling\r\nstraight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and\r\n      door\r\nthen upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking\r\nfancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore\r\nwhat this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore\r\n            meant in croaking nevermore\r\n\r\nthis i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing\r\nto the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core\r\nthis and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining\r\non the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer\r\nbut whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer\r\n            she shall press ah nevermore\r\n\r\nthen methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer\r\nswung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted
