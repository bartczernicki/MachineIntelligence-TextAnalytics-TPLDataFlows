Published November, 1910\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of imposture is always an interesting one, and impostors\r\nin one shape or another are likely to flourish as long as human nature\r\nremains what it is, and society shows itself ready to be gulled.\r\nThe histories of famous cases of imposture in this book have been\r\ngrouped together to show that the art has been practised in many\r\nforms--impersonators, pretenders, swindlers, and humbugs of all kinds;\r\nthose who have masqueraded in order to acquire wealth, position, or\r\nfame, and those who have done so merely for the love of the art.\r\nSo numerous are instances, indeed, that the book cannot profess to\r\nexhaust a theme which might easily fill a dozen volumes; its purpose is\r\nsimply to collect and record a number of the best known instances. The\r\nauthor, nevertheless, whose largest experience has lain in the field of\r\nfiction, has aimed at dealing with his material as with the material\r\nfor a novel, except that all the facts given are real and authentic. He\r\nhas made no attempt to treat the subject ethically; yet from a study of\r\nthese impostors, the objects they had in view, the means they adopted,\r\nthe risks they ran, and the punishments which attended exposure, any\r\nreader can draw his own conclusions.\r\n\r\nImpostors of royalty are placed first on account of the fascinating\r\nglamour of the throne which has allured so many to the attempt. Perkin\r\nWarbeck began a life of royal imposture at the age of seventeen and\r\nyet got an army round him and dared to make war on Harry Hotspur\r\nbefore ending his short and stormy life on the gallows. With a crown\r\nfor stake, it is not surprising that men have been found willing to\r\nrun even such risks as those taken by the impostors of Sebastian\r\nof Portugal and Louis XVII of France. That imposture, even if\r\nunsuccessful, may be very difficult to detect, is shown in the cases of\r\nPrincess Olive and Cagliostro, and in those of Hannah Snell, Mary East,\r\nand the many women who in military and naval, as well as in civil, life\r\nassumed and maintained even in the din of battle the simulation of men.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary and notorious impostures ever known was\r\nthat of Arthur Orton, the Tichborne Claimant, whose ultimate exposure\r\nnecessitated the employment, at great public expense of time and\r\nmoney, of the best judicial and forensic wits in a legal process of\r\nunprecedented length.\r\n\r\nThe belief in witches, though not extinct in our country even to-day,\r\naffords examples of the converse of imposture, for in the majority of\r\ncases it was the superstitions of society which attributed powers of\r\nevil to innocent persons whose subsequent mock-trials and butchery\r\nmade a public holiday for their so-called judges.\r\n\r\nThe long-continued doubt as to the true sex of the Chevalier D’Eon\r\nshows how a belief, no matter how groundless, may persist. Many cases\r\nof recent years may also be called in witness as to the initial\r\ncredulity of the public, and to show how obstinacy maintains a belief\r\nso begun. The Humbert case--too fresh in the public memory to demand\r\ntreatment here--the Lemoine case, and the long roll of other fraudulent\r\nefforts to turn the credulity of others to private gain, show how\r\nwidespread is the criminal net, and how daring and persevering are its\r\nmanipulators.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the book which deals with the tradition of the “Bisley\r\nBoy” has had, as it demanded, more full and detailed treatment than\r\nany other one subject in the volume. Needless to say, the author\r\nwas at first glance inclined to put the whole story aside as almost\r\nunworthy of serious attention, or as one of those fanciful matters\r\nwhich imagination has elaborated out of the records of the past. The\r\nwork which he had undertaken had, however, to be done, and almost from\r\nthe very start of earnest enquiry it became manifest that here was\r\na subject which could not be altogether put aside or made light of.\r\nThere were too many circumstances--matters of exact record, striking\r\nin themselves and full of some strange mystery, all pointing to a\r\nconclusion which one almost feared to grasp as a possibility--to allow\r\nthe question to be relegated to the region of accepted myth. A little\r\npreliminary work amongst books and maps seemed to indicate that so far\r\nfrom the matter, vague and inchoate as it was, being chimerical, it was\r\none for the most patient examination. It looked, indeed, as if those\r\nconcerned in making public the local tradition, which had been buried\r\nor kept in hiding somewhere for three centuries, were on the verge of\r\na discovery of more than national importance. Accordingly, the author,\r\nwith the aid of some friends at Bisley and its neighbourhood, went over\r\nthe ground, and, using his eyes and ears, came to his own conclusions.\r\nFurther study being thus necessitated, the subject seemed to open\r\nout in a natural way. One after another the initial difficulties\r\nappeared to find their own solutions and to vanish; a more searching\r\ninvestigation of the time and circumstances showed that there was\r\nlittle if any difficulty in the way of the story being true in essence\r\nif not in detail. Then, as point after point arising from others\r\nalready examined, assisted the story, probability began to take the\r\nplace of possibility; until the whole gradually took shape as a chain,\r\nlink resting in the strength of link and forming a cohesive whole. That\r\nthis story impugns the identity--and more than the identity--of Queen\r\nElizabeth, one of the most famous and glorious rulers whom the world\r\nhas seen, and hints at an explanation of circumstances in the life of\r\nthat monarch which have long puzzled historians, will entitle it to the\r\nmost serious consideration. In short, if it be true, its investigation\r\nwill tend to disclose the greatest imposture known to history; and to\r\nthis end no honest means should be neglected.\r\n\r\n            B.

PRETENDERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMOUS IMPOSTORS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. PERKIN WARBECK\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard III literally carved his way to the throne of England. It would\r\nhardly be an exaggeration to say that he waded to it through blood.\r\nAmongst those who suffered for his unscrupulous ambition were George\r\nDuke of Clarence, his own elder brother, Edward Prince of Wales, who on\r\nthe death of Edward IV was the natural successor to the English throne,\r\nand the brother of the latter, Richard Duke of York. The two last\r\nmentioned were the princes murdered in the Tower by their malignant\r\nuncle. These three murders placed Richard Duke of Gloucester on the\r\nthrone, but at a cost of blood as well as of lesser considerations\r\nwhich it is hard to estimate. Richard III left behind him a legacy of\r\nevil consequences which was far-reaching. Henry VII, who succeeded\r\nhim, had naturally no easy task in steering through the many family\r\ncomplications resulting from the long-continued “Wars of the Roses”;\r\nbut Richard’s villany had created a new series of complications on\r\na more ignoble, if less criminal, base. When Ambition, which deals\r\nin murder on a wholesale scale, is striving its best to reap the\r\nresults aimed at, it is at least annoying to have the road to success\r\nlittered with the débris of lesser and seemingly unnecessary crimes.\r\nFraud is socially a lesser evil than murder; and after all--humanly\r\nspeaking--much more easily got rid of. Thrones and even dynasties were\r\nin the melting pot between the reigns of Edward III and Henry VII; so\r\nthere were quite sufficient doubts and perplexities to satisfy the\r\nenergies of any aspirant to royal honours--however militant he might\r\nbe. Henry VII’s time was so far unpropitious that he was the natural\r\nbutt of all the shafts of unscrupulous adventure. The first of these\r\ncame in the person of Lambert Simnel, the son of a baker, who in 1486\r\nset himself up as Edward Plantagenet, Earl of Warwick--then a prisoner\r\nin the Tower--son of the murdered Duke of Clarence. It was manifestly\r\na Yorkist plot, as he was supported by Margaret Duchess Dowager of\r\nBurgundy (sister of Edward IV) and others. With the assistance of the\r\nLord-Deputy (the Earl of Kildare) he was crowned in Dublin as King\r\nEdward VI. The pretensions of Simnel were overthrown by the exhibition\r\nof the real Duke of Warwick, taken from prison for the purpose. The\r\nattempt would have been almost comic but that the effects were tragic.\r\nSimnel’s span of notoriety was only a year, the close of which was\r\nattended with heavy slaughter of his friends and mercenaries. He\r\nhimself faded into the obscurity of the minor life of the King’s\r\nhousehold to which he was contemptuously relegated. In fact the whole\r\nsignificance of the plot was that it was the first of a series of\r\nfrauds consequent on the changes of political parties, and served as a\r\n_balon d’essai_ for the more serious imposture of Perkin Warbeck some\r\nfive years afterwards. It must, however, be borne in mind that Simnel\r\nwas a pretender on his own account and not in any way a “pacemaker” for\r\nthe later criminal; he was in the nature of an unconscious forerunner,\r\nbut without any ostensible connection. Simnel went his way, leaving,\r\nin the words of the kingly murderer his uncle, the world free for his\r\nsuccessor in fraud “to bustle in.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERKIN WARBECK]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Stoke, near Newark--the battle which saw the end of the\r\nhopes of Simnel and his upholders--was fought on 16 June, 1487. Five\r\nyears afterwards Perkin Warbeck made his appearance in Cork as Richard\r\nPlantagenet Duke of York. The following facts regarding him and his\r\nlife previous to 1492 may help to place the reader in a position to\r\nunderstand other events and to find causes through the natural gateway\r\nof effects.\r\n\r\nTo Jehan Werbecque (or Osbeck as he was called in Perkin’s\r\n“confession”), Controller of the town of Tournay in Picardy, and his\r\nwife, _née_ Katherine de Faro, was born in 1474, a son christened\r\nPierrequin and later known as Perkin Warbeck. The Low Countries in the\r\nfifteenth century were essentially manufacturing and commercial, and,\r\nas all countries were at that period of necessity military, growing\r\nyouths were thus in touch at many points with commerce, industry and\r\nwar. Jehan Werbecque’s family was of the better middle class, as\r\nwitness his own position and employment; and so his son spent the\r\nearlier years of his life amid scenes and conditions conducive to\r\nambitious dreams. He had an uncle John Stalyn of Ghent. A maternal aunt\r\nwas married to Peter Flamme, Receiver of Tournay and also Dean of the\r\nGuild of Schelde Boatmen. A cousin, John Steinbeck, was an official of\r\nAntwerp.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century Flanders was an important region in the\r\nmanufacturing and commercial worlds. It was the centre of the cloth\r\nindustry; and the coming and going of the material for the clothing of\r\nthe world made prosperous the shipmen not only of its own waters but\r\nthose of others. The ships of the pre-Tudor navy were small affairs\r\nand of light draught suitable for river traffic, and be sure that the\r\nSchelde with its facility of access to the then British port of Calais,\r\nto Lille, to Brussels, to Bruges, to Tournai, Ghent, and Antwerp, was\r\noften itself a highway to the scenes of Continental and British wars.\r\n\r\nAbout 1483 or 1484, on account of the Flemish War, Pierrequin left\r\nTournay, proceeding to Antwerp, and to Middleburg, where he took\r\nservice with a merchant, John Strewe, he being then a young boy of ten\r\nor twelve. His next move was to Portugal, whither he went with the wife\r\nof Sir Edward Brampton, an adherent of the House of York. A good deal\r\nof his early life is told in his own confession made whilst he was a\r\nprisoner in the Tower about 1497.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal he was for a year in the service of a Knight named Peter\r\nVacz de Cogna, who, according to a statement in his confession, had\r\nonly one eye. In the Confession he also states in a general way that\r\nwith de Cogna he visited other countries. After this he was with a\r\nBreton merchant, Pregent Meno, of whom he states incidentally: “he made\r\nme learn English.” Pierrequin Werbecque must have been a precocious\r\nboy--if all his statements are true--for when he went to Ireland in\r\n1491 with Pregent Meno he was only seventeen years of age, and there\r\nhad been already crowded into his life a fair amount of the equipment\r\nfor enterprise in the shape of experience, travel, languages, and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that, to some extent at all events, the imposture of\r\nWerbecque, or Warbeck, was forced on him in the first instance, and\r\nwas not a free act on his own part. His suitability to the part he\r\nwas about to play was not altogether his own doing. Nay, it is more\r\nthan possible that his very blood aided in the deception. Edward IV\r\nis described as a handsome debonair young man, and Perkin Warbeck it\r\nis alleged, bore a marked likeness to him. Horace Walpole indeed in\r\nhis _Historic Doubts_ builds a good deal on this in his acceptance of\r\nhis kingship. Edward was notoriously a man of evil life in the way of\r\naffairs of passion, and at all times the way of ill-doing has been\r\nmade easy for a king. Any student of the period and of the race of\r\nPlantagenet may easily accept it as fact that the trend of likelihood\r\nif not of evidence is that Perkin Warbeck was a natural son of Edward\r\nIV. Three hundred years later the infamous British Royal Marriage\r\nAct made such difficulties or inconveniences as beset a king in the\r\nposition of Edward IV unnecessary: but in the fifteenth century the\r\nusual way out of such messes was ultimately by the sword. Horace\r\nWalpole, who was a clever and learned man, was satisfied that the\r\nperson who was known as Perkin Warbeck was in reality that Richard Duke\r\nof York who was supposed to have been murdered in the Tower in 1483\r\nby Sir James Tyrrell, in furtherance of the ambitious schemes of his\r\nuncle. At any rate the people in Cork in 1491 insisted on receiving\r\nPerkin as of the House of York--at first as a son of the murdered\r\nDuke of Clarence. Warbeck took oath to the contrary before the Mayor\r\nof Cork; whereupon the populace averred that he was a natural son of\r\nRichard III. This, too, having been denied by the newcomer, it was\r\nstated that he was the son of the murdered Duke of York.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the Irish people were in this matter as\r\nunstable as they were swift in their judgments, so that their actions\r\nare really not of much account. Five years before they had received\r\nthe adventurer Lambert Simnel as their king, and he had been crowned\r\nat Dublin. In any case the allegations of Warbeck’s supporters did\r\nnot march with established facts of gynecology. The murdered Duke of\r\nYork was born in 1472, and, as not twenty years elapsed between this\r\nperiod and Warbeck’s appearance in Ireland, there was not time in the\r\nordinary process of nature, for father and son to have arrived at\r\nsuch a quality of manhood that the latter was able to appear as full\r\ngrown. Even allowing for an unusual swiftness of growth common sense\r\nevidently rebelled at this, and in 1492 Perkin Warbeck was received in\r\nhis final semblance of the Duke of York, himself younger son of Edward\r\nIV. Many things were possible at a period when the difficulties of\r\nvoyage and travel made even small distances insuperable. At the end of\r\nthe fifteenth century Ireland was still so far removed from England\r\nthat even Warbeck’s Irish successes, emphasised though they were by the\r\nEarls of Desmond and Kildare and a numerous body of supporters, were\r\nunknown in England till considerably later. This is not strange if one\r\nwill consider that not until centuries later was there a regular postal\r\nsystem, and that nearly two centuries later the Lord Chief Justice\r\nSir Matthew Hale, who was a firm believer in witchcraft, would have\r\ncondemned such a thing as telegraphy as an invention of the Devil.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a historical narrative like the present it must be\r\nborne in mind (amongst other things) that in the fifteenth century,\r\nmen ripened more quickly than in the less strenuous and more luxurious\r\natmosphere of our own day. Especially in the Tudor epoch physical gifts\r\ncounted for far more than is now possible; and as early (and too often\r\nsudden) death was the general lot of those in high places, the span of\r\nworking life was prolonged rather by beginning early than by finishing\r\nlate. Even up to the time of the Napoleonic Wars, promotion was often\r\nwon with a rapidity that would seem like an ambitious dream to young\r\nsoldiers of to-day. Perkin Warbeck, born in 1474, was nineteen years of\r\nage in 1493, at which time the Earl of Kildare spoke of “this French\r\nlad,” yet even then he was fighting King Henry VII, the Harry Richmond\r\nwho had overthrown at Bosworth the great and unscrupulous Richard III.\r\nIt must also be remembered for a proper understanding of his venture,\r\nthat Perkin Warbeck was strongly supported and advised with great\r\nknowledge and subtlety by some very resolute and influential persons.\r\nAmongst these, in addition to his Irish “Cousins” Kildare and Desmond,\r\nwas Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy, sister of Edward IV, who helped the\r\nyoung adventurer in his plot by “coaching” him up in the part which\r\nhe was to play, to such an extent that, according to Lord Bacon, he\r\nwas familiar with the features of his alleged family and relatives and\r\neven with the sort of questions likely to be asked in this connection.\r\nIn fact he was, in theatrical parlance, not only properly equipped\r\nbut “letter-perfect” in his part. Contemporary authority gives as\r\nan additional cause for this personal knowledge, that the original\r\nJehan de Warbecque was a converted Jew, brought up in England, of\r\nwhom Edward IV was the godfather. In any case it may in this age be\r\naccepted as a fact that there was between Edward IV and Perkin Warbeck\r\nso strong a likeness as to suggest a _prima facie_ possibility, if\r\nnot a probability, of paternity. Other possibilities crowd in to the\r\nsupport of such a guess till it is likely to achieve the dimensions of\r\na belief. Even without any accuracy of historical detail there is quite\r\nsufficient presumption to justify guess-work on general lines. It were\r\na comparatively easy task to follow the lead of Walpole and create a\r\nnew “historic doubt” after his pattern, the argument of which would run\r\nthus:\r\n\r\nAfter the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury in 1471, Edward IV had\r\nbut little to contend against. His powerful foes were all either\r\ndead or so utterly beaten as to be powerless for effective war. The\r\nLancastrian hopes had disappeared with the death of Henry VI in the\r\nTower. Margaret of Anjou (wife of Henry VI) defeated at Tewkesbury,\r\nwas in prison. Warwick had been slain at Barnet, and so far as fighting\r\nwas concerned, King Edward had a prolonged holiday. It was these years\r\nof peace--when the coming and going of even a king was unrecorded with\r\nthat precision which marks historical accuracy--that made the period\r\nantecedent to Perkin’s birth. Perkin bore an unmistakable likeness to\r\nEdward IV. Not merely that resemblance which marks a family or a race\r\nbut an individual likeness. Moreover the young manhood of the two ran\r\non parallel lines. Edward was born in 1442, and in 1461, before he\r\nwas nineteen, won the battle of Mortimer’s Cross which, with Towton,\r\nplaced him on the throne. Perkin Warbeck at seventeen made his bid for\r\nroyalty. It is hardly necessary to consider what is a manifest error\r\nin Perkin’s Confession--that he was only nine years old, not eleven,\r\nat the time of the murder of Edward V. Nineteen was young enough in\r\nall conscience to begin an intrigue for a crown; but if the Confession\r\nis to be accepted as gospel this would make him only seventeen at the\r\ntime of his going to Ireland--a manifest impossibility. Any statement\r\nregarding one’s own birth is manifestly not to be relied on. At best\r\nsuch can only be an assertion _minus_ the possibility of testing whence\r\nan error might come. Regarding his parentage, in case it may be alleged\r\nthat there is no record of the wife of Jehan Warbecque having been\r\nin England, it may be allowed to recall a story which Alfred, Lord\r\nTennyson used to say was amongst the hundred best stories. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n    A noble at the Court of Louis XIV was extremely like the King,\r\n    who on its being pointed out to him sent for his double and asked\r\n    him:\r\n\r\n    “Was your mother ever at Court?”\r\n\r\n    Bowing low, he replied:\r\n\r\n    “No, sire; but my father was!”\r\n\r\nOf course Perkin Warbeck’s real adventures, in the sense of dangers,\r\nbegan after his claim to be the brother of Edward V was put forward.\r\nHenry VII was not slow in taking whatever steps might be necessary\r\nto protect his crown; there had been but short shrift for Lambert\r\nSimnel, and Perkin Warbeck was a much more dangerous aspirant. When\r\nCharles VIII invited him to Paris, after the war with France had broken\r\nout, Henry besieged Boulogne and made a treaty under which Perkin\r\nWarbeck was dismissed from France. After making an attempt to capture\r\nWaterford, the adventurer transferred the scene of his endeavours\r\nfrom Ireland to Scotland which offered him greater possibilities for\r\nintrigue on account of the struggles between James IV and Henry VII.\r\nJames, who finally found it necessary to hasten his departure, seemed\r\nto believe really in his pretensions, for he gave him in marriage\r\na kinswoman of his own, Catherine Gordon, daughter of the Earl of\r\nHuntly--who by the way was re-married no less than three times after\r\nPerkin Warbeck’s death. Through the influence of Henry VII, direct\r\nor indirect, Perkin had to leave Scotland as he had been previously\r\nforced from Burgundy and the Low Countries. Country after country\r\nhaving been closed to him, he made desperate efforts in Cornwall, where\r\nhe captured St. Michael’s Mount, and in Devon, where he laid siege\r\nto Exeter. This however being raised by the Royal forces, he sought\r\nsanctuary in Beaulieu in the New Forest where, on promise of his life,\r\nhe surrendered. He was sent to the Tower and well treated; but on\r\nattempting to escape thence a year later, 1499, he was taken. He was\r\nhanged at Tyburn in the same year.\r\n\r\nPierrequin Warbecque’s enterprise was in any case a desperate one\r\nand bound to end tragically--unless, of course, he could succeed\r\nin establishing his (alleged) claim to the throne in law and then\r\nin supporting it at great odds. The latter would necessitate his\r\nvanquishing two desperate fighting men both of them devoid of fear or\r\nscruples--Richard III and Henry VII. In any case he had the Houses of\r\nLancaster, Plantagenet and Tudor against him and he fought with the\r\nrope round his neck.\r\n\r\nAn Act of Parliament, 1 Richard III, Cap. 15, made at Westminster\r\non the 23 Jan., 1485, precluded all possibility--even if Warbeck\r\nshould have satisfied the nation of his identity--of a legal claim to\r\nthe throne, for it forbade any recognition of the offspring of Lady\r\nElizabeth Grey to whom Edward IV was secretly married, in May, 1464,\r\nthe issue of which marriage were Edward V and his brother, Richard. The\r\nact is short and is worth reading, if only for its quaint phraseology.\r\n\r\n  _Cap XV._ Item for certayn great causes and consideracions\r\n    touchynge the suretye of the kynges noble persone as of this\r\n    realme, by the advyce and assente of his lordes spirituall and\r\n    temporal, and the commons in this present parliament assembled,\r\n    and by the auctorite of the same.

THE HIDDEN KING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe personality, nature and life of Sebastian, King of Portugal,\r\nlent themselves to the strange structure of events which followed\r\nhis strenuous and somewhat eccentric and stormy life. He was born in\r\n1554, and was the son of Prince John and his wife Juana, daughter of\r\nthe Emperor Charles V. He succeeded his grandfather, John III, at\r\nthe age of three. His long minority aided the special development\r\nof his character. The preceptor appointed to rule his youth was a\r\nJesuit, Luiz-Goncalvoz de Camara. Not unnaturally his teacher used his\r\nposition to further the religious aims and intrigues of his strenuous\r\nOrder. Sebastian was the kind of youth who is beloved by his female\r\nrelatives--quite apart from his being a King; and naturally he was\r\ntreated by the women in a manner to further his waywardness. When he\r\nwas fourteen years old he was crowned. From thence on he insisted on\r\nhaving his way in everything, and grew into a young manhood which was\r\nof the type beloved of an adventurous people. He was thus described:\r\n\r\n“He was a headstrong violent nature, of reckless courage, of boundless\r\nambition founded on a deep religious feeling. At the time of his\r\ncoronation he was called ‘Another Alexander.’ He loved all kinds of\r\ndanger, and found a keen pleasure in going out in a tempest in a small\r\nboat and in actually running under the guns of his own forts where his\r\ncommands were stringent that any vessel coming in shore should be fired\r\non. He was a notable horseman and could steer his charger efficiently\r\nby the pressure of either knee--indeed he was of such muscular vigour\r\nthat he could, by the mere stringency of the pressure of his knees,\r\nmake a powerful horse tremble and sweat. He was a great swordsman, and\r\nquite fearless. ‘What is fear?’ he used to say. Restless by nature he\r\nhardly knew what it was to be tired.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet this young man--warrior as he was, had a feminine cast of\r\nface; his features were symmetrically formed with just sufficient\r\ndroop in the lower lip to give the characteristic ‘note’ of Austrian\r\nphysiognomy. His complexion was as fine and transparent as a girl’s;\r\nhis eyes were clear and of blue; his hair of reddish gold. His height\r\nwas medium, his figure fine; he was vigorous and active. He had an\r\nair of profound gravity and stern enthusiasm. Altogether he was, even\r\nwithout his Royal state, just such a young man as might stand for the\r\nidol of a young maid’s dream.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he did not seem much of a lover. When, in 1576, he entered\r\nSpain to meet Philip II at Guadaloupe to ask the hand of the Infanta\r\nIsabella in marriage, he was described as “cold as a wooer as he\r\nwas ardent as a warrior.” His eyes were so set on ambition that mere\r\nwoman’s beauty did not seem to attract him. Events--even that event,\r\nthe meeting--fostered his ambition. When he knelt to his host, the\r\nelder king kissed him and addressed him as “Your Majesty” the first\r\ntime the great title had been used to a Portuguese king. The effect\r\nmust have come but little later for at that meeting he kissed the\r\nhand of the old warrior, the Duke of Alva, and uncovered to him. His\r\nunderlying pride, however, was shewn at the close of that very meeting,\r\nfor he claimed equal rights in formality with the Spanish king; and\r\nthere was a danger that the visit of ceremony might end worse than it\r\nbegan. Neither king would enter the carriage in which they were to\r\nproceed together, until the host suggested that as there were two doors\r\nthey should enter at the same time.\r\n\r\nSebastian’s religious fervour and military ambition became one when\r\nhe conceived the idea of renewing the Crusades; he would recover the\r\nHoly Land from the dominion of the Paynim and become himself master of\r\nMorocco in the doing of it. With the latter object in his immediate\r\nview, he made in 1574, against the wise counsels of Queen Catherine,\r\na _sortie de reconnaissance_ of the African coast; but without any\r\nresult--except the fixing of his resolution to proceed. In 1578 his\r\nscheme was complete. He would listen to no warning or counsel on the\r\nsubject even from the Pope, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, or the Duke of\r\nNassau. He seemed to foresee the realization of his dreams, and would\r\nforego nothing. He gathered an army of some 18,000 men (of which less\r\nthan 2,000 were horsemen) and about a dozen cannon. The preparation was\r\nmade with great splendour--a sort of forerunner of the Great Armada. It\r\nseemed to be, as in the case of the projected invasion of England ten\r\nyears later by Spain, a case of “counting the chickens before they were\r\nhatched.”\r\n\r\nSome indication of the number of adventurers and camp followers\r\naccompanying the army is given by the fact that the 800 craft ordained\r\nfor the invasion of Morocco carried in all some 24,000 persons,\r\ninclusive of the fighting men. The paraphernalia and officials of\r\nvictory comprised amongst many other luxuries: lists for jousts, a\r\ncrown ready for the new King of Morocco to put on, and poets with\r\ncompleted poems celebrating victory.\r\n\r\nAt this time Morocco was entering on the throes of civil war. Muley\r\nAbd-el-Mulek, the reigning Sultan, was opposed by his nephew, Mohammed,\r\nand to aid the latter, who promised to bring in 400 horsemen, was the\r\nimmediate object of Sebastian. But the fiery young King of Portugal had\r\nundertaken more than he was able to perform. Abd-el-Mulek opposed his\r\n18,000 Portuguese with 55,000 Moors, (of whom 36,000 were horsemen)\r\nand with three times his number of cannon. The young Crusader’s\r\ngeneralship was distinctly defective; he was a fine fighting man, but\r\na poor commander. Instead of attacking at once on his arrival and so\r\nputting the zeal of his own troops and the discouragement of the enemy\r\nto the best advantage, he wasted nearly a week in hunting parties and\r\nineffectual manœuvring. When finally issue was joined, Abd-el-Mulek,\r\nthough he was actually dying, surrounded the Portuguese forces and cut\r\nthem to pieces. Sebastian, though he fought like a lion, and had three\r\nhorses killed under him, was hopelessly beaten. There was an attendant\r\npiece of the grimmest comedy on record. The Sultan died during the\r\nbattle, but he was a stern old warrior, and as he fell back in his\r\nlitter he put his finger on his lip to order with his last movement\r\nthat his death should be kept secret for the time being. The officer\r\nbeside him closed the curtains and went on with the fight, pretending\r\nto take orders from the dead man and to transmit them to the captains.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Sebastian was sealed in that battle. Whether he lived or\r\ndied, he disappeared on 5 August, 1578. One story was that after the\r\nbattle of Alcaçer-el-Kebir, his body stripped and showing seven wounds\r\nwas found in a heap of the slain; that it was taken to Fez and there\r\nburied; but was afterwards removed to Europe and found resting place\r\nin the Convent of Belen. Another story was that after a brilliant\r\ncharge on his enemies he was taken in, but having been rescued by Lui\r\nde Brito he escaped unpursued. Certainly no one seemed to have seen\r\nthe King killed, and it was strange that no part of his clothing or\r\naccoutrements was ever found. These were of great splendour, beauty and\r\nworth, and must have been easily traceable. There was a rumour that on\r\nthe night following the battle some fugitives, amongst whom was one of\r\ncommanding distinction, sought refuge at Arzilla.\r\n\r\nAlcaçer-el-Kebir was known as the “Battle of the three Kings.” All the\r\nprincipals engaged in it perished. Sebastian was killed or disappeared.\r\nAbd-el-Mulek died as we have seen, and Mohammed was drowned in trying\r\nto cross the river.\r\n\r\nThe dubiety of Sebastian’s death gave rise in after years to several\r\nimpostures.\r\n\r\nThe first began six years after Sebastian’s successor--his uncle,\r\nCardinal Henry--was placed on the throne. The impostor was known as the\r\n“King of Penamacor.” The son of a potter at Alcobaca, he established\r\nhimself at Albuquerque, within the Spanish borders, somewhat to the\r\nnorth of Badajos, and there gave himself out as “a survivor of the\r\nAfrican Campaign.” As usual the public went a little further and said\r\nopenly that he was the missing Don Sebastian. At first he denied the\r\nsoft impeachment, but later on the temptation became too great for him\r\nand he accepted it and set up in Penamacor, where he became known as\r\nthe “King of Penamacor.” He was arrested and paraded through Lisbon,\r\nbareheaded, as if to let the public see that he in no way resembled the\r\npersonality of Sebastian. He was sent to the galleys for life. But he\r\nmust have escaped, for later on he appeared in Paris as Silvio Pellico,\r\nDuke of Normandy, and was accepted as such in many of the salons in the\r\nexclusive Faubourg St. Germain.\r\n\r\nThe second personator of Sebastian was one Matheus Alvares, who having\r\nfailed to become a monk, a year later imitated the first impostor, and\r\nin 1585 set up a hermitage at Ericeira. He bore some resemblance to the\r\nlate king in build, and in the strength of this he boldly gave himself\r\nout as “King Sebastian” and set out for Lisbon. But he was arrested\r\nby the way and entered as a prisoner. He was tried and executed with\r\nfrightful accessories to the execution.\r\n\r\nThe third artist in this imposture appeared in 1594. He was a Spaniard\r\nfrom Madrigal in Old Castile--a cook, sixty years old (Sebastian would\r\nhave been just forty if he had lived). When arrested he was given but\r\nshort shrift and shared the same ghastly fate as his predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe fourth, and last, imposture was more serious. This time the\r\npersonator began in Venice in 1598, calling himself “Knight of the\r\nCross.”\r\n\r\nAs twenty years had now elapsed since the disappearance of Sebastian,\r\nhe would have changed much in appearance, so in one respect the\r\npersonator had less to contend against. Moreover the scene of endeavour\r\nwas this time laid in Venice, a place even more widely removed in the\r\nsixteenth century from Lisbon by circumstances than by geographical\r\nposition. Again witnesses who could give testimony to the individuality\r\nof the missing King of twenty years ago were few and far between. But\r\non the other hand the new impostor had new difficulties to contend\r\nagainst. Henry, the Cardinal, had only occupied the Portuguese throne\r\ntwo years, for in 1580 Philip II of Spain had united the two crowns,\r\nand had held the dual monarchy for eighteen years. He was a very\r\ndifferent antagonist from any one that might be of purely Portuguese\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of many of the people--like all the Latin races naturally\r\nsuperstitious--one circumstance powerfully upheld the impostor’s\r\nclaim. So long ago as 1587, Don John de Castro had made a seemingly\r\nprophetic statement that Sebastian was alive and would manifest himself\r\nin due time. His utterance was, like most such prophecies of the\r\nkind, “conducive to its own fulfilment;” there were many--and some of\r\nthem powerful--who were willing at the start to back up any initiator\r\nof such a claim. In his time Sebastian had been used, so far as it\r\nwas possible to use a man of his temperament and position, by the\r\nintriguers of the Catholic Church, and the present occasion lent itself\r\nto their still-existent aims. Rome was very powerful four centuries\r\nago, and its legions of adherents bound in many ties, were scattered\r\nthroughout the known world. Be sure these could and would aid in any\r\nmovement or intrigue which could be useful to the Church.\r\n\r\n“The Knight of the Cross”--who insinuated, though he did not state\r\nso, that he was a Royal person was arrested on the showing of the\r\nSpanish Ambassador. He was a born liar, with all the readiness which\r\nthe carrying out of such an adventure as he had planned requires. Not\r\nonly was he well posted in known facts, but he seemed to be actually\r\nproof against cross-examination. The story he told was that after the\r\nbattle of Alcaçer-el-Kebir he with some others, had sought temporary\r\nrefuge in Arzilla and in trying to make his way from there to the East\r\nIndies, he had got to “Prester John’s” land--the semi-fabled Ethiopia\r\nof those days. From thence he had been turned back, and had, after\r\nmany adventures and much wandering--in the course of which he had been\r\nbought and sold a dozen times or more, found his way, alone, to Venice.\r\nAmongst other statements he alleged that Sebastian’s confessor had\r\nalready recognised and acknowledged him; but he was doubtless ignorant,\r\nwhen he made the statement, that Padre Mauricio, Don Sebastian’s\r\nconfessor, fell with his king in 1578. Two things, one, a positive\r\ninference and the other negative, told against him. He only knew of\r\nsuch matters as had been made public in depositions, and _he did not\r\nknow Portuguese_. The result of his first trial was that he was sent to\r\nprison for two years.\r\n\r\nBut those two years of prison improved his case immensely. In that\r\ntime he learned the Portuguese language and many facts of history.\r\nOne of the first to believe--or to allege belief, in his story, Fray\r\nEstevan de Sampayo, a Dominican monk, was in 1599, sent by the Venetian\r\nauthorities to Portugal to obtain an accredited description of the\r\npersonal marks of King Sebastian. He returned within a year with a\r\nlist of sixteen personal marks--attested by an Apostolic notary.\r\nStrange to say the prisoner exhibited every one of them--a complete\r\nagreement which in itself gave rise to the new suspicion that the list\r\nhad been made out by, or on behalf of, the prisoner. The proof however\r\nwas accepted--for the time; and he was released on the 28th of July,\r\n1600--but with the imperative, humiliating proviso that he was to quit\r\nVenice within four and twenty hours under penalty of being sent to\r\nthe galleys. A number of his supporters, who met him before he went,\r\nfound that he had in reality no sort of resemblance to Sebastian. Don\r\nJohn de Castro, who was amongst them, said that a great change in\r\nSebastian seemed to have taken place. (He had prophesied and adhered\r\nto his prophecy.) He now described him as a man of medium height and\r\npowerful frame, with hair and beard of black or dark brown, and said\r\nhe had completely lost his beauty. “What has become of my fairness?”\r\nthe swarthy ex-prisoner used to say. He had eyes of uncertain colour,\r\nnot large but sparkling; high cheek bones; long nose; thin lips with\r\nthe “Hapsburg droop” in the lower one. He was short from the waist\r\nup. (Sebastian’s doublet would fit no other person.) His right leg\r\nand arm were longer than the left, the legs being slightly bowed like\r\nSebastian’s. He had small feet with extraordinarily high insteps; and\r\nlarge hands. “In fine,” Don John summed up illogically, “he is the\r\nself-same Sebastian--except for such differences as resulted from years\r\nand labours.” Some other particulars he added which are in no way\r\nhelpful to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe Impostor told his friends that he had in 1597, sent a messenger\r\nfrom Constantinople to Portugal--one Marco Tullio Catizzone--who had\r\nnever returned. Thence he had travelled to Rome--where, when he was\r\njust on the eve of being presented to the Holy Father, he was robbed of\r\nall he had; thence to Verona and so on to Venice. After his expulsion\r\nfrom Venice he seems to have found his way to Leghorn and Florence, and\r\nthence on to Naples, where he was handed over to the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Spanish Viceroy, the Count of Lemos, who had visited him in prison,\r\nand who well remembered King Sebastian whom he had seen when in a\r\ndiplomatic mission. The Viceroy came to the conclusion that he bore no\r\nlikeness at all to Sebastian, that he was ignorant of all save the well\r\nknown historical facts that had been published, and that his speech\r\nwas of “corrupt Portuguese mingled with tell-tale phrases of Calabrian\r\ndialect.” Thereupon he took active steps against him. One witness who\r\nwas produced, recognized in him the real Marco Tullio Catizzone, and\r\nCount de Lemos sent for his wife, mother-in-law and brother-in-law,\r\nall of whom he had deceived and deserted. His wife, Donna Paula of\r\nMessina, acknowledged him; and he confessed his crime. Condemned to the\r\ngalleys for life, Marco Tullio, out of consideration of a possibility\r\nof an error of justice, was so far given indulgence by the authorities\r\nthat he did not have to wear prison dress or labour at the oar. Many\r\nof his supporters, who still believed in him, tried to mitigate his\r\nlot and treated him as a companion; so that the hulk at San Lucar, at\r\nthe mouth of the Guadalquiver became a minor centre of intrigue. But\r\nstill he was not content, and adventuring further, he tried to get\r\nmoney from the wife of Medina-Sidonia then Governor of Andalusia. He\r\nwas again arrested with some of his associates. Incriminating documents\r\nwere found on him. He was racked and confessed all. And so in his real\r\nname and parentage, Marco Tullio, son of Ippolit Catizzone of Taverna,\r\nand of Petronia Cortes his wife, and husband of Paula Gallardetta\r\nwas executed. He had, though of liberal education, never worked at\r\nany occupation or calling; but he had previously to his great fraud,\r\npersonated other men--amongst them Don Diego of Arragon. On 23rd of\r\nSeptember, 1603, he was dragged on a hurdle to the Square of San Lucar;\r\nhis right hand was cut off and he was hanged. Five of his companions,\r\nincluding two priests, shared his fate.\r\n\r\nBut in a way he and the previous impostors had a sort of posthumous\r\nrevenge, for Sebastian had now entered into the region of Romantic\r\nBelief. He was, like King Arthur, the ideal and the heart of a great\r\nmyth. He became “The Hidden King” who would some day return to aid his\r\nnation in the hour of peril--the destined Ruler of the Fifth Monarchy,\r\nthe founder of an universal Empire of Peace.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago, the custom in British theatres was to finish\r\nthe evening’s performance with a farce. On this occasion the tragedy\r\nhad been finished two centuries before the “comic relief” came. The\r\noccasion was in the French occupation of Portugal in 1807. The strange\r\nbelief in the Hidden King broke out afresh. A rigorous censorship\r\nof Sebastianist literature was without avail--even though its\r\ndisseminators were condemned by the still-existing Inquisition. The old\r\nprophecy was renewed, with a local and personal application--Napoleon\r\nwas to be destroyed in the Holy Week of 1808, by the waiting Sebastian,\r\nwhose approach from his mysterious retreat was to be veiled with a\r\nthick fog. There were to be new portents; the sky was to be emblazoned\r\nwith a cross of the Order of Aviz, and on March 19th a full moon was\r\nto occur during the last quarter. All these things were foretold in an\r\n_egg_, afterwards sent by Junot to the National Museum. The general\r\nattitude of the French people towards the subject was illustrated by\r\na remark in an ironical manner of one writer: “what can be looked for\r\nfrom a people, one half of whom await the Messiah, the other half Don\r\nSebastian?” The authority on the subject of King Sebastian, M. d’Antas,\r\nrelates that as late as 1838, after the crushing of a Sebastianist\r\ninsurrection in Brazil certain still believing Sebastianists were to\r\nbe seen along the coast peering through the fog for the sails of the\r\nmythical ship which was to bring to them the Hidden King who was then\r\nto reveal himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. “STEFAN MALI”\r\n\r\nTHE FALSE CZAR\r\n\r\n\r\nStefan Mali (Stephen the Little) was an impostor who passed himself\r\noff in Montenegro as the Czar Peter III of Russia, who was supposed\r\nto have been murdered in 1762. He appeared in the Bocche di Cattaro\r\nin 1767. No one seemed to know him or to doubt him; indeed after he\r\nhad put forth his story he did not escape identification. One witness\r\nwho had accompanied a state visit to Russia averred that he recognized\r\nthe features of the Czar whom he had seen in St. Petersburg. Like all\r\nadventurers Stefan Mali had good personal resources. An adventurer,\r\nand especially an adventurer who is also an impostor, must be an\r\nopportunist; and an opportunist must be able to move in any direction\r\nat any time; therefore he must be always ready for any emergency. The\r\ntime, the place, and the circumstances largely favoured the impostor\r\nin this case. It is perhaps but fair to credit him with foreknowledge,\r\nintention, and understanding of all that he did. In after years he\r\njustified himself in this respect and showed distinctly that he was a\r\nman of brains and capable of using them. He was no doubt not only able\r\nto sustain at the start his alleged personality, but also to act under\r\nnew conditions and in new circumstances as they developed themselves,\r\nas a man of Czar Peter’s character and acquired knowledge might have\r\ndone. Cesare Augusto Levi, who is the authority on this subject, says,\r\nin his work “_Venezia e il Montenegro_”: “He was of fine presence and\r\nwell proportioned form and of noble ways. He was so eloquent that he\r\nexercised with mere words a power not only on the multitude but also on\r\nthe higher classes.... He must certainly have been in St. Petersburg\r\nbefore he scaled Montenegro; and have known the true Peter III, for\r\nhe imitated his voice and his gestures--to the illusionment of the\r\nMontenegrins. There is no certainty of such a thing, but he must,\r\nin the belief of the Vladika Sava have been a descendant of Stefano\r\nCzernovich who reigned after Giorgio IV.”\r\n\r\nAt that time Montenegro was ruled by Vladika Sava, who having spent\r\nsome twenty years in monastic life, was unfitted for the government of\r\na turbulent nation always harassed by the Turks and always engaged in\r\na struggle for bare existence. The people of such a nation naturally\r\nwanted a strong ruler, and as they were discontented under the sway of\r\nSava the recognition of Stefan Mali was almost a foregone conclusion.\r\nHe told a wonderful story of his adventures since his reported death--a\r\nstory naturally interesting to such an adventurous people; and as he\r\nstated his intention of never returning to Russia, they were glad to\r\nadd such a new ally to their fighting force for the maintenance of\r\ntheir independence. As the will of the people was for the new-comer,\r\nthe Vladika readily consented to confine himself to his spiritual\r\nfunctions and to allow Stefan to govern. The Vladika of Montenegro\r\nheld a strange office--one which combined the functions of priest and\r\ngeneralissimo--so that the new division of the labour of ruling was\r\nrather welcome than otherwise to the people of a nation where no man\r\never goes without arms. Stephen--as he now was--governed well. He\r\ndevoted himself fearlessly to the punishment of ill-doing, and early\r\nin his reign had men shot for theft. He established Courts of Justice\r\nand tried to further means of communication throughout the little\r\nkingdom, which, is, after all, little more than a bare rock. He even\r\nso far impinged on Sava’s sacred office as to prohibit Sunday labour.\r\nIn fact his labours so much improved the outlook of the Montenegrins\r\nthat the result brought trouble on himself as well as on the nation in\r\ngeneral. Hitherto, whatever foreign nations may have believed as to the\r\nauthenticity of Stephen’s claim, they had deliberately closed their\r\neyes to his new existence, so long as under his rule the little nation\r\nof Montenegro did not become a more dangerous enemy to all or any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut the nations interested grew anxious at the forward movement in\r\nMontenegro. Venice, then the possessor of Dalmatia, was alarmed,\r\nand Turkey regarded the new ruler as an indirect agent of Russia.\r\nTogether they declared war. This was the moment when Fate declared\r\nthat the Pretender should show his latent weakness of character. The\r\nMontenegrins are naturally so brave that cowardice is unknown amongst\r\nthem; but Stephen did not dare to face the Turkish army, which attacked\r\nMontenegro on all the land sides. But the Montenegrins fought on till\r\na chance came to them after many months of waiting in the shape of a\r\nfearful storm which desolated their enemies’ Camp. By a sudden swoop\r\non the camp they seized much ammunition of which they were sadly in\r\nwant and by the aid of which they gained delivery from their foes.\r\nThe Russian government seemed then to wake up to the importance of\r\nthe situation, and, after sending the Montenegrins much help in the\r\nshape of war material, asked them to join again in the war against the\r\nTurks. The Empress Catherine in addition to this request, sent another\r\nletter denouncing Stephen as an impostor. He admitted the charge and\r\nwas put in prison. But in the impending war a strong man was wanted\r\nat the head of affairs; and Sava, who now had the mundane side of\r\nhis dual office once more thrust again upon him, was a weak one. The\r\nsituation was saved by Prince George Dolgourouki, the representative\r\nof the Empress Catherine, who, with statesmanlike acumen, saw that\r\nsuch a desperate need required an exceptional remedy. He recognized the\r\nfalse Czar as Regent. Stephen Mali, thus restored to power under such\r\npowerful auspices, once more governed Montenegro until 1774, when he\r\nwas murdered by the Greek player Casamugna--by order, it is said, of\r\nthe Pasha of Scutari, Kara Mahmound.\r\n\r\nBy the irony of Fate this was exactly the way in which the real Czar,\r\nwhose personality he had assumed, had died some dozen years before.\r\n\r\nThis impostor was perhaps the only one who in the history of nations\r\nprospered finally in his fraud. But as may be seen he was possessed of\r\nhigher gifts than most of his kind; he was equal to the emergencies\r\nwhich presented themselves--and circumstances favoured him, rarely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. THE FALSE DAUPHINS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 21 January, 1793, Louis XVI of France was beheaded in the Place de\r\nla Revolution, formerly Place de Louis Quinze. From the moment his head\r\nfell, his only son the Dauphin became by all constitutional usage, his\r\nsuccessor, Louis XVII. True the child-king was in the hands of his\r\nenemies; but what mattered that to believers in the “Divine Right.”\r\nWhat mattered it either that he was at that moment in the prison of\r\nthe Temple, where he had languished since August 13, 1792, already\r\nconsecrated to destruction, in one form or another. He was then under\r\neight years of age, and so an easy victim. His gaoler, one Simon, had\r\nalready been instructed to bring him up as a “sansculotte.” In the\r\nfurtherance of this dreadful ordinance he was taught to drink and swear\r\nand to take a part in the unrighteous songs and ceremonies of the Reign\r\nof Terror. Under such conditions no one can be sorry that death came to\r\nhis relief. This was in June, 1795--he being then in his eleventh year.\r\nIn the stress and turmoil of such an overwhelming cataclysm as the\r\nRevolution, but little notice was taken of a death which, under other\r\ncircumstances, would undoubtedly have been of international interest\r\nif not of importance. But by this time the death of any one, so long as\r\nit was by violence, was too common a matter to cause concern to others.\r\nThe Terror had practically glutted the lust for blood. Under such\r\nconditions but little weight was placed on the accuracy of records; and\r\nto this day there survive practical inconveniences and difficulties\r\nin daily life from the then disruption of ordered ways. The origin of\r\nsuch frauds or means of fraud as are now before us is in uncertainty.\r\nShakespeare says:\r\n\r\n    “How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds\r\n    Makes ill deeds done.”\r\n\r\nThe true or natural criminal is essentially an opportunist. The\r\nintention of crime, even if it be only a desire to follow the line\r\nof least resistance, is a permanent factor in such lives, but the\r\ndirection, the mechanism, and the scope of the crime are largely the\r\nresult of the possibilities which open and develop themselves from a\r\nfore-ordered condition of things.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD IV AS A YOUNG MAN]\r\n\r\nHere then was the opening which presented itself at the end of the\r\neighteenth century. France was in a state of social chaos. The\r\nfountains of the deep were stirred, and no human intelligence could\r\ndo more than guess at what might result from any individual effort of\r\nself-advancement. The public conscience was debauched, and for all\r\npractical purposes the end justified the means. It was an age of\r\ndesperate adventure, of reckless enterprise, of unscrupulous methods.\r\nThe Royalty of France was overthrown--in abeyance till at least such\r\na time as some Colossus of brains or energy, or good fortune, should\r\nset it up again. The hopes of a great nation of return to a settled\r\norder of things through constitutional and historical channels were\r\ncentred in the succession to the Crown. And through the violence of the\r\nupheaval any issue was possible. The state of affairs just before the\r\ndeath of Louis XVII gave a chance of success to any desperate fraud.\r\nThe old King was dead, the new King was a child and in the hands of his\r\nbitterest enemies. Even if anyone had cared to vindicate his rights\r\nthere seemed at present no way of accomplishing this object. To any\r\nreckless and unscrupulous adventurer here was an unique chance. Here\r\nwas a kingship going: a daring hand might grasp the crown which rested\r\nin so perilous a manner on the head of a baby. Moreover the events of\r\nthe last fifteen years of the century had not only begotten daring\r\nwhich depended on promptness, but had taught and fostered desperation.\r\nIt is a wonder to us who look back on that time through the\r\nsafety-giving mist of a century, not that there was any attempt to get\r\na crown, if only by theft, but that there were not a hundred attempts\r\nmade for each one that history has recorded.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, there were seven attempts made to personate the\r\ndead Dauphin, son of Louis XVI, that “son of St. Louis,” who, in\r\nobedience to Abbé Edgworth’s direction to “ascend to heaven,” went\r\nsomewhere where it is difficult--or perhaps inexpedient--to follow him.\r\n\r\nThe first pretender appears to have been one Jean Marie Hervagault, son\r\nof a tailor. His qualification for the pretence appears to have been\r\nbut a slender one, that of having been born in 1781, only about three\r\nyears before the Dauphin. This, taken by itself, would seem to be but\r\na poor equipment for such a crime; but in comparison with some of the\r\nlater claimants it was not without reason of approximate possibility as\r\nfar as date was concerned. It was not this criminal’s first attempt at\r\nimposture, for he had already pretended to be a son of la Vaucelle of\r\nLongueville and of the Duc d’Ursef. Having been arrested at Hottot as a\r\nvagabond, he was taken to Cherburg, where he was claimed by his father.\r\nWhen claiming to be, like the old man in Mark Twain’s inimitable\r\n_Huckleberry Finn_, “the late Dauphin,” his story was that he had as\r\na child been carried from the prison of the Temple in a basket of\r\nlinen. In 1799 he was imprisoned at Chalons-sur-Marne for a month. He\r\nwas, however, so far successful in his imposture as Louis XVII, that\r\nafter some adventures he actually achieved a good following--chiefly\r\nof the landed interest and clerics. He was condemned to two years’\r\nimprisonment at Vitry, and afterwards to a term of twice that duration,\r\nduring which he died, in 1812.\r\n\r\nThe second and third aspirants to the honour of the vacant crown were\r\ninconspicuous persons possessing neither personal qualification nor\r\napparent claim of any sort except that of a desire for acquisition. One\r\nwas Persat, an old soldier; the other, Fontolive, a bricklayer. The\r\npretence of either of these men would have been entirely ridiculous but\r\nfor its entirely tragic consequences. There is short shrift for the\r\nunsuccessful impostor of royalty--even in an age of fluctuation between\r\nrebellion and anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe fourth pretender was at least a better workman at crime than his\r\npredecessors. This was Mathurin Brunneau--ostensibly a shoemaker\r\nbut in reality a vagabond peasant from Vezins, in the department of\r\nMaine-et-Loire. He was a born criminal as was shown by his early\r\nrecord. When only eleven years of age he claimed to be the son of the\r\nlord of the village, Baron de Vezins. He obtained the sympathy of the\r\nCountess de Turpin de Crisse, who seemed to have compassion for the\r\nboy. Even when the fraud of his parentage was found out she took him\r\nback into her household--but amongst the servants. After this his life\r\nbecame one of adventure. When he was fifteen he made a tour through\r\nFrance. In 1803 he was put in the House of Correction at St. Denis. In\r\n1805 he enlisted as a gunner. In 1815 he re-appeared with an American\r\npassport bearing the name of Charles de Navarre. His more ambitious\r\nattempt at personation in 1817, was not in the long run successful.\r\nHe claimed his rights, as “Dauphin” Bourbon under Louis XVIII, was\r\narrested at St. Malo, and confined at Bicêtre. He got round him a\r\ngang of persons of evil life, as shown by their various records. One\r\nwas a false priest, another a prisoner for embezzlement, another an\r\nex-bailiff who was also a forger, another a deserter; with the usual\r\ncriminal concomitant of women, dishonoured clergy and such like. At\r\nRouen he was sentenced to pay a fine of three thousand francs in\r\naddition to imprisonment for seven years. He died in prison.\r\n\r\nThe imposture regarding the Dauphin was like a torch-race--so soon\r\nas the lighted torch fell from the hand of one runner it was lifted\r\nby him who followed. Brunneau, having disappeared into the prison at\r\nRouen, was succeeded by Henri Herbert who made a dramatic appearance in\r\nAustria in 1818. At the Court in Mantone, the scene of his appearance,\r\nhe gave the name of Louis Charles de Bourbon, Duc de Normandie.\r\nHis account of himself, given in his book published in 1831, and\r\nrepublished--with enlargements, by Chevalier del Corso in 1850, is\r\nwithout any respect at all for the credulity of his readers.\r\n\r\nThe story tells how an alleged doctor, one answering to the not common\r\nname of Jenais-Ojardias, some time before the death of the Dauphin had\r\nhad made a toy horse of sufficient size to contain the baby king, the\r\nopening to the interior of which was hidden by the saddle-cloth. The\r\nwife of the gaoler Simon, helped in the plot, the carrying out of which\r\nwas attempted early in 1794. Another child about the Dauphin’s size,\r\ndying or marked for death by fatal disease, was drugged and hidden\r\nin the interior. When the toy horse was placed in the Dauphin’s cell\r\nthe children were exchanged, the little king having also been drugged\r\nfor the purpose. It would almost seem that the narrator here either\r\nlost his head or was seized with a violent _cacoethes scribendi_, for\r\nhe most unnecessarily again lugs in the episode adapted from Trojan\r\nhistory. The worthy doctor of the double name had another horse\r\nmanufactured, this time of life size. Into the alleged entrails of\r\nthis animal, which was harnessed with three real horses as one of a\r\nteam of four, the Dauphin, once more drugged, was concealed. He was\r\nborne to refuge in Belgium, where he was placed under the protection\r\nof the Prince de Condé. By this protector he was, according to his\r\nstory, sent to General Kléber who took him to Egypt as his nephew under\r\nthe name of Monsieur Louis. After the battle of Marengo in 1800, he\r\nreturned to France, where he confided his secret to Lucien Bonaparte\r\nand to Fouché (the Minister of Police), who got him introduced to the\r\nEmpress Josephine, who recognised him by a scar over his right eye. In\r\n1804 (still according to his story), he embarked for America and got\r\naway to the banks of the Amazon, where amid the burning deserts (as\r\nhe put it) he had adventures capable of consuming lesser romancists\r\nwith envy. Some of these adventures were amongst a tribe called “the\r\nMamelucks”--which name was at least reminiscent of his alleged Egyptian\r\nexperiences. From the burning deserts on the banks of the Amazon he\r\nfound his way to Brazil, where a certain “Don Juan,” late of Portugal\r\nand at that time Regent of Brazil, gave him asylum.\r\n\r\nLeaving the hospitable home of Don Juan, he returned to Paris in 1815.\r\nHere Condé introduced him to the Duchesse d’Angoulême (his sister!)\r\nand according to his own naïve statement “the Princess was greatly\r\nsurprised,” as indeed she might well have been--quite as much as the\r\nwitch of Endor was by the appearance of Samuel. Having been repulsed\r\nby his (alleged) sister, the alleged king made a little excursion,\r\nembracing in its erratic course Rhodes, England, Africa, Egypt, Asia\r\nMinor, Greece, and Italy. When in Austria he met Silvio Pellico in\r\nprison. Having spent some years himself in prison in the same country,\r\nhe went to Switzerland. Leaving Geneva in 1826, he entered France,\r\nunder the name of Herbert. He was in Paris the following year under\r\nthe name of “Colonel Gustave,” and forthwith revived his fraud of being\r\n“the late Dauphin.” In 1828, he appealed to the Chamber of Peers. To\r\nthis appeal he appears to have received no direct reply; but apropos\r\nof it, Baron Mounier made a proposition to the Chamber that in future\r\nno such application should be received unless properly signed and\r\nattested and presented by a member of the Chamber. He gathered round\r\nhim some dupes who believed in him. To these he told a number of\r\nstrange lies based on some form of perverted truth, but always taking\r\ncare that those of whom he spoke were already dead. Amongst them was\r\nthe wife of Simon, who had died in 1819. Desault, the surgeon, who\r\nhad medical care of Louis XVII, and who died in 1795, the ex-Empress\r\nJosephine, who died in 1814, General Pichegru, who died in 1804, and\r\nthe Duc de Bourbon (Prince de Condé) who died in 1818. In the course\r\nof his citation of the above names, he plays havoc with generally\r\naccepted history--Desault according to him did not die naturally but\r\nwas poisoned. Josephine died simply because she knew the secret of\r\nthe young King’s escape. Pichegru died from a similar cause and not\r\nby suicide. Fualdes was assassinated, but it was because he knew the\r\nfatal secret. With regard to one of his dead witnesses whose name was\r\nThomas-Ignace-Martin de Gallardon, there is a rigmarole which would not\r\nbe accepted in the nursery of an idiot asylum. There is a mixture of\r\nPagan mythology and Christian hagiology which would have been condemned\r\nby Ananias himself. In one passage he talks of seeing suddenly before\r\nhim--he could not tell (naturally enough) whence he came--a sort of\r\nangel who had wings, a long coat and a _high hat_. This supernatural\r\nperson ordered the narrator to tell the King that he was in danger,\r\nand the only way to avoid it was to have a good police and to keep the\r\nSabbath. Having given his message the visitant rose in the air and\r\ndisappeared. Later on the suggested angel told him to communicate with\r\nthe Duc Decazes. The Duke naturally, and wisely enough, handed the\r\ncredulous peasant over to the care of a doctor. Martin himself died,\r\npresumably by assassination, in 1834.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1830 awoke the pretensions of Herbert, who now\r\nappeared as the Baron de Richmont, and wrote to the Duchesse\r\nd’Angoulême, his (supposed) sister, putting on her the blame of all\r\nhis troubles. But the consequences of this effort were disastrous to\r\nhim. He was arrested in August, 1833. After hearing many witnesses the\r\nCourt condemned him to imprisonment for twelve years. He was arraigned\r\nunder the name of “Ethelbert Louis-Hector-Alfred,” calling himself the\r\n“Baron de Richmont.” He escaped from Clairvaux, whither he had been\r\ntransferred from Saint-Pélagie, in 1835. In 1843 and 1846 he published\r\nhis memoirs--enlarged but omitting some of his earlier assertions,\r\nwhich had been disproved. He returned to France after the amnesty of\r\n1840. In 1848 he appealed--unheeded--to the National Assembly. He died\r\nin 1855 at Gleyze.\r\n\r\nThe sixth “Late Dauphin” was a Polish Jew called Naundorf--an impudent\r\nimpostor not even seeming suitably prepared by time for the part\r\nwhich he had thus voluntarily undertaken, having been born in 1775,\r\nand thus having been as old at the birth of the Dauphin as the latter\r\nwas when he died. This individual had appeared in Berlin in 1810,\r\nand was married in Spandau eight years later. He had been punished\r\nfor incendiarism in 1824, and later got three years’ imprisonment\r\nat Brandenburg for coining. He may be considered as a fairly good\r\nall-round--if unsuccessful--criminal. In England he was imprisoned for\r\ndebt. He died in Delft in 1845.\r\n\r\nThe last attempt at impersonating Louis XVII, the seventh, afforded\r\nwhat might in theatrical parlance be called the “comic relief” of the\r\nwhole series, both as regards means and results. This time the claimant\r\nto the Kingship of France was none other than a half-bred Iroquois, one\r\ncalled Eleazar, who appeared to be the ninth son of Thomas Williams,\r\notherwise Thorakwaneken, and an Indian woman, Mary Ann Konwatewentala.\r\nThis lady, who spoke only Iroquois, said at the opportune time she was\r\n_not_ the mother of Lazar (Iroquois for Eleazar). She made her mark as\r\nshe could not write. Eleazar had been almost an idiot till the age\r\nof thirteen; but, being struck on the head by a stone, recovered his\r\nmemory and intelligence. He said he remembered sitting on the knees of\r\na beautiful lady who wore a rich dress with a train. He also remembered\r\nseeing in his childhood a terrible person; shewn the picture of Simon\r\nhe recognised him with terror. He learned English but imperfectly,\r\nbecame a Protestant and a missionary and married. His profile was\r\nsomething like that of the typical Bourbon. In 1841, the Prince de\r\nJoinville, seeing him on his travels in the United States, told him\r\n(according to Eleazar’s account) that he was the son of a king, and got\r\nhim to sign and seal a parchment, already prepared, the same being a\r\nsolemn abdication of the Crown of France in favour of Louis Philippe,\r\nmade by Charles Louis, son of Louis XVI, also styled Louis XVII King of\r\nFrance and Navarre. The seal used was the seal of France, the one used\r\nby the old Monarchy. The “poor Indian with untutored mind” made with\r\ncharming diffidence the saving clause regarding the seal,--“if I am not\r\nmistaken.” Of course there was in the abdication a clause regarding\r\nthe payment of a sum of money “which would enable me to live in great\r\nluxury in this country or in France as I might choose.” The Reverend\r\nEleazar, despite his natural disadvantages and difficulties, was\r\nmore fortunate than his fellow claimants inasmuch as the time of his\r\nimposture was more propitious. Louis Philippe, who was always anxious\r\nto lessen the danger to his tottering throne, made a settlement on him\r\nfrom his Civil List, and the “subsequent proceedings interested him no\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\nAltogether the Louis XVII impostures extended over a period of some\r\nsixty years, beginning with Hervagault’s pretence soon after the death\r\nof the Dauphin, and closing at Gleyze with the death of Henri Herbert,\r\nthe alleged Baron de Richmont who appeared as the alleged Duc de\r\nNormandie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE. PRINCESS OLIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of Mrs. Olive Serres, as nature made it, was one thing; it\r\nwas quite another as she made it for herself. The result, before the\r\nstory was completely told, was a third; and, compared with the other,\r\none of transcendent importance. Altogether her efforts, whatsoever\r\nthey were and crowned never so effectively, showed a triumph in its\r\nway of the thaumaturgic art of lying; but like all structures built\r\non sand it collapsed eventually. In the plain version--nature’s--the\r\nfacts were simply as follows. She, and a brother of no importance, were\r\nthe children of a house painter living in Warwick, one Robert Wilmot,\r\nand of Anna Maria his wife. Having been born in 1772 she was under\r\nage when in 1791 she was married, the ceremony therefore requiring\r\nlicence supported by bond and affidavit. Her husband was John Thomas\r\nSerres who ten years later was appointed marine painter to King George\r\nIII. Mr. and Mrs. Serres were separated in 1804 after the birth of two\r\ndaughters, the elder of whom, born in 1797, became in 1822 the wife\r\nof Antony Thomas Ryves a portrait painter--whom she divorced in 1847.\r\nMrs. A. T. Ryves twelve years later filed a petition praying that the\r\nmarriage of her mother, made in 1791, might be declared valid and she\r\nherself the legitimate issue of that marriage. The case was heard in\r\n1861, Mrs. Ryves conducting it in person. Having produced sufficient\r\nevidence of the marriage and the birth, and there being no opposition,\r\nthe Court almost as a matter of course pronounced the decree asked for.\r\nIn this case no complications in the way of birth or marriage of Mrs.\r\nSerres were touched on.\r\n\r\nRobert Wilmot, the house-painter, had an elder brother James who became\r\na Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and went into the Church, taking\r\nhis degree of Doctor of Divinity. Through his College he was presented\r\nin 1781 to the living of Barton-on-the-heath, Warwickshire. The\r\nStatutes of his College contained a prohibition against marriage whilst\r\na Fellow. James Wilmot D. D. died in 1807 leaving his property between\r\nthe two children of Robert, after life-use by his brother. James and\r\nRobert Wilmot had a sister Olive, who was born in 1728 and married in\r\n1754 to William Payne with issue one daughter, Olivia, born in 1759.\r\nRobert Wilmot died in 1812.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLIVIA SERRES]\r\n\r\nOut of these rough materials Mrs. Olive Serres set herself in due\r\ncourse to construct and carry out, as time and opportunity allowed,\r\nand as occasions presented themselves and developed, a fraudulent\r\nromance in real life and action. She was, however, a very clever\r\nwoman and in certain ways--as was afterwards proved by her literary and\r\nartistic work--well dowered by nature for the task--crooked though it\r\nwas--which she set for herself. Her ability was shown not only by what\r\nshe could do and did at this time of her life, but by the manner in\r\nwhich she developed her natural gifts as time went on. In the sum of\r\nher working life, in which the perspective of days becomes merged in\r\nthat of years, she touched on many subjects, not always of an ordinary\r\nkind, which shewed often that she was of conspicuous ability, having\r\nbecome accomplished in several branches of art. She was a painter of\r\nsufficient merit to have exhibited her work in the Royal Academy in\r\n1794 and to be appointed landscape-painter to the Prince of Wales in\r\n1806. She was a novelist, a press writer, an occasional poet and in\r\nmany ways of a ready pen. She was skilled in some forms of occultism,\r\nand could cast horoscopes; she wrote, in addition to a pamphlet on\r\nthe same subject, a book on the writings of Junius, claiming to have\r\ndiscovered the identity of the author--none other than James Wilmot\r\nD. D. She wrote learnedly on disguised handwriting. In fact she touched\r\non the many phases of literary effort which come within the scope of\r\nthose who live by the work of their brains. Perhaps, indeed, it was\r\nher facility as a writer that helped to lead her astray; for in her\r\npractical draughtsmanship and in her brain teeming with romantic ideas\r\nshe found a means of availing herself of opportunities suggested by\r\nher reckless ambition. Doubtless the cramped and unpoetic life of her\r\nhumble condition in the house-painter’s home in Warwick made her fret\r\nand chafe under its natural restraint. But when she saw her way to\r\nan effective scheme of enlarging her self-importance she acted with\r\nextraordinary daring and resource. As is usual with such natures,\r\nwhen moral restraints have been abandoned, the pendulum swung to\r\nits opposite. As she had been lowly she determined to be proud; and\r\nhaving fixed on her objective began to elaborate a consistent scheme,\r\nutilising the facts of her own surroundings as the foundation of her\r\nimposture. She probably realised early that there must be a base\r\nsomewhere, and so proceeded to manufacture or arrange for herself a new\r\nidentity into which the demonstrable facts of her actual life could be\r\nwrought. At the same time she manifestly realised that in a similar\r\nway fact and intention must be interwoven throughout the whole of\r\nher contemplated creation. Accordingly she created for herself a new\r\n_milieu_ which she supported by forged documents of so clever a conceit\r\nand such excellent workmanship, that they misled all who investigated\r\nthem, until they came within the purview of the great lawyers of the\r\nday whose knowledge, logical power, skill and determination were\r\narrayed against her. By a sort of intellectual metabolism she changed\r\nthe identities and conditions of her own relations whom I have\r\nmentioned, always taking care that her story held together in essential\r\npossibilities, and making use of the abnormalities of those whose\r\nprototypes she introduced into fictional life.\r\n\r\nThe changes made in her world of new conditions were mainly as follows:\r\nHer uncle, the Reverend James, who as a man of learning and dignity\r\nwas accustomed to high-class society, and as a preacher of eminence\r\noccasionally in touch with Crown and Court, became her father; and she\r\nherself the child of a secret marriage with a great lady whose personal\r\nrank and condition would reflect importance on her daughter. But proof,\r\nor alleged proof, of some kind would be necessary and there were too\r\nmany persons at present living whose testimony would be available\r\nfor her undoing. So her uncle James shifted his place and became\r\nher grandfather. To this the circumstances of his earlier life gave\r\ncredibility in two ways; firstly because they allowed of his having\r\nmade a secret marriage, since he was forbidden to marry by the statutes\r\nof his college, and secondly because they gave a reasonable excuse for\r\nconcealing his marriage and the birth of a child, publicity regarding\r\nwhich would have cost him his livelihood.\r\n\r\nAt this point the story began to grow logically, and the whole scheme\r\nto expand cohesively. Her genius as a writer of fiction was being\r\nproved; and with the strengthening of the intellectual nature came\r\nthe atrophy of the moral. She began to look higher; and the seeds of\r\nimagination took root in her vanity till the madness latent in her\r\nnature turned wishes into beliefs and beliefs into facts. As she was\r\nimagining on her own behoof, why not imagine beneficially? This all\r\ntook time, so that when she was well prepared for her venture things\r\nhad moved on in the nation and the world as well as in her fictitious\r\nromance. Manifestly she could not make a start on her venture until\r\nthe possibility vanished of witnesses from the inner circle of her\r\nown family being brought against her; so that she could not safely\r\nbegin machinations for some time. She determined however to be ready\r\nwhen occasion should serve. In the meantime she had to lead two lives.\r\nOutwardly she was Olive Serres, daughter of Robert Wilmot born in 1772\r\nand married in 1791, and mother of two daughters. Inwardly she was\r\nthe same woman with the same birth, marriage and motherhood, but of\r\ndifferent descent being (imaginatively) grand-daughter of her (real)\r\nuncle the Rev. James Wilmot D. D. The gaps in the imaginary descent\r\nhaving been thus filled up as made and provided in her own mind, she\r\nfelt more safe. Her uncle--so ran her fiction--had early in his college\r\nlife met and become friends with Count Stanislaus Poniatowski who later\r\nbecame by election King of Poland. Count Poniatowski had a sister--whom\r\nthe ingenious Olive dubbed “Princess of Poland”--who became the wife\r\nof her uncle (now her grandfather) James. To them was born, in 1750,\r\na daughter Olive, the marriage being kept secret for family reasons,\r\nand the child for the same reason being passed off as the offspring of\r\nRobert the housepainter. This child Olive, according to the fiction,\r\nmet His Royal Highness Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland, brother\r\nof the King, George III. They fell in love with each other and were\r\nprivately married--by the Rev. James Wilmot D. D.--on 4 March 1767.\r\nThey had issue one daughter, Olive, born at Warwick 3 April 1772. After\r\nliving with her for four years the Duke of Cumberland deserted his\r\nwife, who was then pregnant, and in 1771 married--bigamously, it was\r\nalleged--Lady Anne Horton, sister of Colonel Luttrell, daughter of Lord\r\nIrnham, and widow of Andrew Horton of Catton, Derbyshire. The (alleged)\r\nRoyal Duchess died in France in 1774, and the Duke in 1790.\r\n\r\nThus fact and fiction were arrayed together in a very cunning way.\r\nThe birth of Olive Wilmot (afterwards Serres) in 1772 was proved by a\r\ngenuine registry. Likewise that of her daughter Mrs. Ryves. For all the\r\nrest the certificates were forged. Moreover there was proof of another\r\nOlive Wilmot whose existence, supported by genuine registration, might\r\navert suspicion; since it would be difficult to prove after a lapse of\r\ntime that the Olive Wilmot born at Warwick in 1772 daughter of Robert\r\n(the house-painter), was not the granddaughter of James (the Doctor of\r\nDivinity). In case of necessity the real date (1759) of the birth of\r\nOlive Wilmot sister of the Rev. James could easily be altered to the\r\nfictitious date of the birth of “Princess” Olive born 1750.\r\n\r\nIt was only in 1817 that Mrs. Serres began to take active measures for\r\ncarrying her imposture into action; and in the process she made some\r\ntentative efforts which afterwards made difficulty for her. At first\r\nshe sent out a story, through a memorial to George III, that she was\r\ndaughter of the Duke of Cumberland by Mrs. Payne, wife of Captain Payne\r\nand sister of James Wilmot D. D. This she amended later in the same\r\nyear by alleging that she was a natural daughter of the Duke by the\r\nsister of Doctor Wilmot, whom he had seduced under promise of marriage.\r\nIt was not till after the deaths of George III and the Duke of Kent in\r\n1820, that the story took its third and final form.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed that care was taken not to clash with laws already\r\nin existence or to run counter to generally received facts. In 1772 was\r\npassed the Royal Marriage Act (12 George III Cap. 11) which nullified\r\nany marriage contracted with anyone in the succession to the Crown to\r\nwhich the Monarch had not given his sanction. Therefore Mrs. Serres\r\nhad fixed the (alleged) marriage of (the alleged) Olive Wilmot with\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland as in 1767--five years earlier--so that the\r\nAct could not be brought forward as a bar to its validity. Up to 1772\r\nsuch marriages could take place legally. Indeed there was actually a\r\ncase in existence--the Duke of Gloucester (another brother of the King)\r\nhaving married the dowager Countess of Waldegrave. It was of common\r\nrepute that this marriage was the motive of the King’s resolve to have\r\nthe Royal Marriage Act added to the Statute book. At the main trial it\r\nwas alleged by Counsel, in making the petitioner’s claim, that the King\r\n(George III) was aware of the Duke of Cumberland’s marriage with Olive\r\nWilmot, although it was not known to the public, and that when he heard\r\nof his marriage with Lady Anne Horton he was very angry and would not\r\nallow them to come to Court.\r\n\r\nThe various allegations of Mrs. Serres as to her mother’s marriage were\r\nnot treated seriously for a long time but they were so persisted in\r\nthat it became necessary to have some denial in evidence. Accordingly a\r\nlaw-case was entered. One which became a _cause célèbre_. It began in\r\n1866--just about a hundred years from the time of the alleged marriage.\r\nWith such a long gap the difficulties of disproving Mrs. Serres’\r\nallegations were much increased. But there was no help for it; reasons\r\nof State forbade the acceptance or even the doubt of such a claim. The\r\nreally important point was that if by any chance the claimant should\r\nwin, the Succession would be endangered.\r\n\r\nThe presiding judge was the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Cockburn. With\r\nhim sat Lord Chief Baron Pollock and the Judge Ordinary Sir James\r\nWilde. There was a special jury. The case took the form of one in the\r\nEnglish Probate Court made under the “Legitimacy Declaration Act.” In\r\nthis case, Mrs. Ryves, daughter of Mrs. Serres, was the petitioner.\r\nAssociated with her in the claim was her son, who, however, is of no\r\ninterest in the matter and need not be considered. The petition stated\r\nthat Mrs. Ryves was the legitimate daughter of one John Thomas Serres\r\nand Olive his wife, the said Olive being, whilst living, a natural-born\r\nsubject and the legitimate daughter of Henry Frederick, Duke of\r\nCumberland and Olive Wilmot, his wife. That the said Olive Wilmot, born\r\nin 1750, was lawfully married to His Royal Highness Henry Frederick,\r\nDuke of Cumberland, fourth son of Frederick Prince of Wales (thus being\r\ngrandson of George II and brother of King George III), on 4 March 1767,\r\nat the house of Thomas, Lord Archer, in Grosvenor Square, London, the\r\nmarriage being performed by the Rev. James Wilmot D. D., father of the\r\nsaid Olive Wilmot. That a child, Olive, was born to them on 3 April\r\n1772, who in 1791 was married to John Thomas Serres. And so on in\r\naccordance with the (alleged) facts above given.\r\n\r\nThe strange position was that even if the petitioner should win her\r\nmain case she would prove her own illegitimacy. For granting that the\r\nalleged Olive Serres should have been legally married to the Duke of\r\nCumberland, the Royal Marriage Act, passed five years later, forbade\r\nthe union of the child of such a marriage, except with the sanction of\r\nthe reigning monarch.\r\n\r\nIn the making of the claim of Mrs. Ryves a grave matter appeared--one\r\nwhich rendered it absolutely necessary that the case should be heard\r\nin the most formal and adequate way and settled once for all. The\r\nmatter was one affecting the legality of the marriage of George III,\r\nand so touching the legitimacy of his son afterwards George IV, his son\r\nafterwards William IV and his son the Duke of Kent, father of Queen\r\nVictoria--and so debarring them and all their descendants from the\r\nCrown of England. The points of contact were in documents insidiously\r\nthough not overtly produced and the preparation of which showed much\r\nconstructive skill in the world of fiction. Amongst the many documents\r\nput in evidence by the Counsel for Mrs. Ryves were two certificates of\r\nthe (alleged) marriage between Olive Wilmot and the Duke of Cumberland.\r\nOn the back of each of these alleged certificates was written what\r\npurported to be a certificate of the marriage of George III to Hannah\r\nLightfoot performed in 1759 by J. Wilmot. The wording of the documents\r\nvaried slightly.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that the claim of Mrs. Ryves and her son became linked\r\nup with the present and future destinies of England. These alleged\r\ndocuments too, brought the Attorney General upon the scene. There\r\nwere two reasons for this. Firstly the action had to be taken against\r\nthe Crown in the matter of form; secondly in such a case with the\r\npossibility of such vast issues it was absolutely necessary that every\r\nposition should be carefully guarded, every allegation jealously\r\nexamined. In each case the Attorney General was the proper official to\r\nact.\r\n\r\nThe Case of the Petitioners was prepared with extraordinary care.\r\nThere were amongst the documents produced, numbering over seventy,\r\nsome containing amongst them forty-three signatures of Dr. Wilmot,\r\nsixteen of Lord Chatham, twelve of Mr. Dunning (afterwards the 1st\r\nBaron Ashburton), twelve of George III, thirty-two of Lord Warwick and\r\neighteen of H.R.H., the Duke of Kent, the father of Queen Victoria.\r\nTheir counsel stated that although these documents had been repeatedly\r\nbrought to the notice of the successive Ministers of the Crown, it had\r\nnever been suggested until that day that they were forgeries. This\r\nlatter statement was traversed in Court by the Lord Chief Baron, who\r\ncalled attention to a debate on the subject in the House of Commons in\r\nwhich they were denounced as forgeries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those documents already quoted were the following\r\ncertificates:\r\n\r\n    “The marriage of these parties was this day duly solemnized at\r\n    Kew Chapel, according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church\r\n    of England, by myself.\r\n\r\n            “J. Wilmot.”\r\n\r\n      “George P.”\r\n      “Hannah.”\r\n\r\n    Witness to this marriage\r\n\r\n      “W. Pitt.”\r\n      “Anne Taylor.”\r\n\r\n            May 27, 1759.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n            April 17, 1759\r\n\r\n    “This is to Certify that the marriage of these parties (George,\r\n    Prince of Wales, to Hannah Lightfoot) was duly solemnized this\r\n    day, according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of\r\n    England, at their residence at Peckham, by myself.\r\n\r\n            “J. Wilmot.”\r\n\r\n      “George Guelph.”\r\n      “Hannah Lightfoot.”\r\n\r\n    Witness to the marriage of these parties,--\r\n\r\n  “William Pitt.”\r\n  “Anne Taylor.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “I hereby Certify that George, Prince of Wales, married Hannah\r\n    Wheeler _alias_ Lightfoot, April 17, 1759, but from finding the\r\n    latter to be her right name I solemnized the union of the said\r\n    parties a second time May the 27th, 1759, as the Certificate\r\n    affixed to this paper will confirm.\r\n\r\n      “J. Wilmot.\r\n      Witness (Torn)”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe case for the Crown was strongly supported. Not only did the\r\nAttorney-General, Sir Roundell Palmer (afterwards Lord Chancellor\r\nand First Earl of Selborne) appear himself, but he was supported by\r\nthe Solicitor-General, the Queen’s Advocate, Mr. Hannen and Mr. R.\r\nBourke. The Attorney-General made the defence himself. At the outset\r\nit was difficult to know where to begin, for everywhere undoubted and\r\nunchallenged facts were interwoven with the structure of the case; and\r\nof all the weaknesses and foibles of the important persons mentioned,\r\nfull advantage was taken. The marriage of the Duke of Gloucester to\r\nLady Waldegrave had made him unpopular in every way, and he was at the\r\ntime a _persona ingrata_ at Court. There had been rumours of scandal\r\nabout the King (when Prince of Wales) and the “Fair Quaker,” Hannah\r\nLightfoot. The anonymity of the author of the celebrated “Letters of\r\nJunius,” which attacked the King so unmercifully, lent plausibility to\r\nany story which might account for it. The case of Mrs. Ryves, tried\r\nin 1861, in which her own legitimacy had been proved and in which\r\nindisputable documents had been used, was taken as a proof of her _bona\r\nfides_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ryves herself was in the box for nearly the whole of three days,\r\nduring which she bore herself firmly, refusing even to sit down when\r\nthe presiding judge courteously extended that privilege to her. She\r\nwas then, by her own statement, over seventy years of age. In the\r\ncourse of her evidence a Memorial to George IV was produced, written\r\nby her mother, Mrs. Serres, in which the word offspring was spelled\r\n“orfspring”; in commenting on which the Attorney-General produced a\r\ncongratulatory Ode to the Prince Regent on his birthday in 1812, by the\r\nsame author, in which occurred the line:\r\n\r\n“Hail valued heir orfspring of Heaven’s smile.” Similar eccentric\r\northography was found in other autograph papers of Mrs. Serres.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General, in opposing the claim, alleged that the whole\r\nstory of the Duke of Cumberland’s marriage to Olive Wilmot was a\r\nconcoction from beginning to end, and said that the mere statement of\r\nthe Petitioner’s case was sufficient to stamp its true character. That\r\nits folly and absurdity were equal to its audacity; in every stage\r\nit exposed itself to conviction by the simplest tests. He added that\r\nthe Petitioner might have dwelt so long upon documents produced and\r\nfabricated by others, that, with her memory impaired by old age, the\r\nprinciple of veracity might have been poisoned, and the offices of\r\nimagination and memory confounded to such an extent that she really\r\nbelieved that things had been done and said in her presence which were\r\nin fact entirely imaginary. No part of her story was corroborated\r\nby a single authentic document, or by a single extrinsic fact. The\r\nforgery, falsehood and fraud of the case were proved in many ways. The\r\nexplanations were as false and feeble as the story itself. “I cannot\r\nof course,” he said, “lay bare the whole history of the concoction\r\nof these extraordinary documents, but there are circumstances which\r\nindicate that they were concocted by Mrs. Serres herself.”\r\n\r\nHaving commented on some other matters spoken of, but regarding which\r\nno evidence was adduced, he proceeded to speak of the alleged wife of\r\nJoseph Wilmot D. D., the Polish Princess, sister of Count Poniatowski,\r\nafterwards elected King of Poland (1764), who was the mother of his\r\ncharming daughter, Olive. “The truth is,” said Sir Roundell, “that\r\nboth the Polish Princess and the charming daughter were pure myths;\r\nno such persons ever existed--they were as entirely creatures of the\r\nimagination as Shakespeare’s Ferdinand and Miranda.”\r\n\r\nAs to the documents produced by the Petitioners he remarked:\r\n\r\n    “What sort of documents were those which were produced? The\r\n    internal evidence proved that they were the most ridiculous,\r\n    absurd, preposterous series of forgeries that the perverted\r\n    ingenuity of man ever invented ... they were all written on\r\n    little scraps and slips of paper, such as no human being would\r\n    ever have used for the purpose of recording transactions of this\r\n    kind, and it would be proved that in every one of these pieces of\r\n    paper the watermark of date was wanting.”\r\n\r\nThis was but a new variant of the remark made by the Lord Chief\r\nJustice, just after the putting-in of the alleged marriage Certificate\r\nof the Prince of Wales and Hannah Lightfoot:\r\n\r\n    “The Court is, as I understand, asked solemnly to declare, on the\r\n    strength of two certificates, coming I know not whence, written\r\n    on two scraps of paper, that the marriage, the only marriage of\r\n    George III which the world believes to have taken place, between\r\n    His Majesty and Queen Charlotte, was an invalid marriage, and\r\n    consequently that all the Sovereigns who have sat on the throne\r\n    since his death, including Her present Majesty, were not entitled\r\n    to sit on the throne. That is the conclusion which the Court is\r\n    asked to come to upon these two rubbishy pieces of paper, one\r\n    signed ‘George P.,’ and the other ‘George Guelph.’ I believe them\r\n    to be gross and rank forgeries. The Court has no difficulty in\r\n    coming to the conclusion, even assuming that the signatures had\r\n    that character of genuineness which they have not, that what is\r\n    asserted in these documents has not the slightest foundation in\r\n    fact.”\r\n\r\nWith this view the Lord Chief Baron and the Judge-Ordinary entirely\r\nconcurred, the former adding:\r\n\r\n    “... the declarations of Hannah Lightfoot, if there ever was such\r\n    a person, cannot be received in evidence on the faith of these\r\n    documents ... the only issues for the jury are the issues in the\r\n    cause and this is not an issue in the cause, but an incidental\r\n    issue.... I think that these documents, which the Lord Chief\r\n    Justice has treated with all the respect which properly belongs\r\n    to them, are not genuine.”\r\n\r\nBefore the Attorney General had finished the statement of his case, he\r\nwas interrupted by the foreman of the jury, who said that the jury were\r\nunanimously of opinion that there was no necessity to hear any further\r\nevidence as they were convinced that the signatures of the documents\r\nwere not genuine. On this the Lord Chief Justice said:\r\n\r\n    “You share the opinion which my learned brothers and I have\r\n    entertained for a long time; that every one of the documents is\r\n    spurious.”\r\n\r\nAs the Counsel for the Petitioners had “felt it his duty to make some\r\nobservations to the jury before they delivered their verdict,” and had\r\nmade them, the Lord Chief Justice summed up. Towards the conclusion of\r\nhis summing-up he said, in speaking of the various conflicting stories\r\nput forth by Mrs. Serres:\r\n\r\n    “In each of the claims which she made at different times, she\r\n    appealed to documents in her possession by which they were\r\n    supported. What was the irresistible inference? Why, that\r\n    documents were from time to time prepared to meet the form which\r\n    her claims from time to time assumed.”\r\n\r\nThe jury, without hesitation, found that they were not satisfied “that\r\nOlive Serres, the mother of Mrs. Ryves, was the legitimate daughter of\r\nHenry Frederick Duke of Cumberland and Olive his wife; and they were\r\nnot satisfied that Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland, was lawfully\r\nmarried to Olive Wilmot on the 4th of March 1767....”\r\n\r\nThe case of Mrs. Serres is an instance of how a person, otherwise\r\ncomparatively harmless but afflicted with vanity and egotism, may be\r\nled away into evil courses, from which, had she realised their full\r\niniquity, she might have shrunk. The only thing outside the case we\r\nhave been considering, was that she separated from her husband; which\r\nindeed was an affliction rather than a crime. She had been married\r\nfor thirteen years and had borne two children, but so far as we know\r\nno impropriety was ever alleged against her. One of her daughters\r\nremained her constant companion till her twenty-second year and through\r\nher long life held her and her memory in filial devotion and respect.\r\nThe forethought, labour and invention which she devoted to the fraud,\r\nif properly and honestly used, might have won for her a noteworthy\r\nplace in the history of her time. But as it was, she frittered away in\r\ncriminal work her good opportunities and great talents, and ended her\r\nlife within the rules of the King’s Bench.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. PRACTITIONERS OF MAGIC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARACELSUS\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel that I ought to begin this record with an apology to the _manes_\r\nof a great and fearless scholar, as earnest as he was honest, as\r\nopen-minded as he was great-hearted. I do so because I wish to do what\r\nan unimportant man can after the lapse of centuries, to help a younger\r\ngeneration to understand what such a man as I write of can do and did\r\nunder circumstances not possible in times of greater enlightenment.\r\nThe lesson which the story can tell to thinking youth cannot be told\r\nin vain. The greatest asset which worth has in this world is the\r\nirony of time. Contemporaneous opinion, though often correct, is\r\ngenerally on the meagre side of appreciation--practically always so\r\nwith regard to anything new. Such must in any case be encountered in\r\nmatters of the sixteenth century which being on the further side of\r\nan age of discovery and reform had hardened almost to the stage of\r\nossification the beliefs and methods of the outgoing order of things.\r\nPrejudice--especially when it is based on science and religion--dies\r\nhard: the very spirit whence originates a stage of progress or reform,\r\nmakes its inherited follower tenacious of _its_ traditions however\r\nshort they may be. This is why any who, in this later and more open\r\nminded age, may investigate the intellectual discoveries of the past,\r\nowe a special debt in the way of justice to the memories of those to\r\nwhom such fresh light is due. The name and story of the individual\r\nknown as Paracelsus--scholar, scientist, open minded thinker and\r\nteacher, earnest investigator and searcher for elemental truths--is\r\na case in point. Anyone who contents himself with accepting the\r\njudgment of four centuries passed upon the great Swiss thinker, who\r\nhad rendered famous in history his place of birth, his canton and his\r\nnation, would inevitably come to the conclusion that he was merely a\r\ncharlatan a little more clever than others of his kind; an acceptor of\r\nall manner of eccentric beliefs (including the efficacy of spirits and\r\ndemons in pathological cases), a drunkard, a wastrel, an evil liver,\r\na practiser of necromancy, an astrologer, a magician, an atheist,\r\nan alchemist--indeed an “ist” of all defamatory kinds within the\r\nterminology of the sixteenth century and of all disputatious churchmen\r\nand scientists who have not agreed with his theories and conclusions\r\never since.\r\n\r\nLet us begin with the facts of his life. His name was Theophrastus\r\nBombast von Hohenheim, and he was the son of a doctor living in\r\nEinsiedeln in the canton of Schwyz, named Wilhelm Bombast von\r\nHohenheim, natural son of a Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. He\r\nwas born in 1490. It was not uncommon for a man of that age who was\r\nstriving to make a name for himself, to assume some _nom de plume_\r\nor _de guerre_; and with such a family record as his own, it was no\r\nwonder that on the threshold of his life the young Theophrastus did so.\r\nIn the light of his later achievements, we can well imagine that he\r\nhad some definite purpose in mind, or at least some guiding principle\r\nof suggestiveness, in choosing such a compound word from the Greek\r\nas Paracelsus (which is derived from “para,” meaning before, in the\r\nsense of superior to, and Celsus, the name of an Epicurean philosopher\r\nof the second century.) Celsus appears to have had views of great\r\nenlightenment according to the thought of his own time. Unhappily only\r\nfragments of his work remain, but as he was a follower of Epicurus\r\nafter an interval of between four and five centuries, it is possible\r\nto get some idea of his main propositions. Like Epicurus he stood for\r\nnature. He did not believe in fatalism, but he did in a supreme power.\r\nHe was a Platonist and held that there was no truth which was against\r\nnature. It is easy to see from his life and work that Theophrastus\r\nBombast von Hohenheim shared his views. His intellectual attitude\r\nwas that of a true scientist--denying nothing _prima facie_ but\r\ninvestigating all.\r\n\r\n    “There lives more faith in honest doubt,\r\n    Believe me, than in half the creeds.”\r\n\r\nHis father moved in 1502 to Villach in Carinthia, where he practised\r\nmedicine till his death in 1534. Theophrastus was a precocious boy;\r\nafter youthful study with his father, he entered the University of\r\nBasel when he was about sixteen, after which he prosecuted chemical\r\nresearches under the learned Trithemius Bishop of Sponheim who had\r\nwritten on the subject of the Great elixir--the common subject\r\nof the scientists of that day,--and at Wurzburg. From thence he\r\nproceeded to the great mines in the Tyrol, then belonging to the\r\nFugger family. Here he studied geology and its kindred branches of\r\nlearning--especially those dealing with effects and so far as possible\r\nwith causes--metallurgy, mineral waters, and the diseases of and\r\naccidents to mines and miners. The theory of knowledge which he deduced\r\nfrom these studies was that we must learn nature from nature.\r\n\r\nIn 1527, he returned to Basel, where he was appointed town physician.\r\nIt was a characteristic of his independence and of his mind, method\r\nand design, that he lectured in the language of the place, German,\r\nforegoing the Latin tongue, usual up to that time for such teaching.\r\nHe did not shrink from a bold criticism of the medical ideas and\r\nmethods then current. The effect of this independence and teaching was\r\nthat for a couple of years his reputation and his practice increased\r\nwonderfully. But the time thus passed allowed his enemies not only\r\nto see the danger for them that lay ahead, but to take such action\r\nas they could to obviate it. Reactionary forces are generally--if\r\nnot always--self-protective, without regard to the right or wrong\r\nof the matter, and Paracelsus began to find that the self-interest\r\nand ignorance of the many were too strong for him, and that their\r\nunscrupulous attacks began to injure his work seriously. He was called\r\nconjurer, necromancer, and many such terms of obloquy. Then what we may\r\ncall his “professional” enemies felt themselves strong enough to join\r\nin the attack. As he had kept a careful eye on the purity of medicines\r\nin use, the apothecaries, who, in those days worked in a smaller field\r\nthan now, and who found their commerce more productive through guile\r\nthan excellence, became almost declared opponents. Eventually he had to\r\nleave Basel. He went to Esslingen, from which however he had to retire\r\nat no distant period from sheer want.\r\n\r\nThen began a period of wandering which really lasted for the last dozen\r\nyears of his life. This time was mainly one of learning in many ways\r\nof many things. The ground he covered must have been immense, for he\r\nvisited Colmar, Nurnberg, Appengall, Zurich, Augsburg, Middelheim,\r\nand travelled in Prussia, Austria, Hungary, Egypt, Turkey, Russia,\r\nTartary, Italy, the Low Countries and Denmark. In Germany and Hungary\r\nhe had a bad time, being driven to supply even the bare necessaries of\r\nlife by odd--any--means, even to availing himself of the credulity\r\nof others--casting nativities, telling fortunes, prescribing remedies\r\nfor animals of the farm such as cows and pigs, and recovering stolen\r\nproperty; such a life indeed as was the lot of a mediæval “tramp.” On\r\nthe other hand, as a contra he did worthy work as a military surgeon\r\nin Italy, the Low Countries and Denmark. When he got tired of his\r\nwandering life, he settled down in Salsburg, in 1541, under the care\r\nand protection of the Archbishop Ernst. But he did not long survive\r\nthe prospect of rest; he died later in the same year. The cause of his\r\ndeath is not known with any certainty, but we can guess that he had\r\nclamorous enemies as well as strong upholding from the conflicting\r\ncauses given. Some said that he died from the effects of a protracted\r\ndebauch, others that he was murdered by physicians and apothecaries, or\r\ntheir agents, who had thrown him over a cliff. In proof of this story\r\nit was said that the surgeons had found a flaw or fracture in his skull\r\nwhich must have been produced during life.\r\n\r\nHe was buried in the churchyard of Saint Sebastian; but two centuries\r\nlater, 1752, his bones were moved to the porch of the church, and a\r\nmonument erected over them.\r\n\r\nHis first book was printed in Augsburg in 1526. His real monument\r\nwas the collection of his complete writings so far as was possible,\r\nthe long work of Johann Huser made in 1589-91. This great work was\r\npublished in German, from printed copy supplemented by such manuscript\r\nas could be discovered. Then and ever since there has been a perpetual\r\nrain of statements against him and his beliefs. Most of them are too\r\nsilly for words; but it is a little disconcerting to find one writer of\r\nsome distinction repeating so late as 1856 all the malignant twaddle\r\nof three centuries, saying amongst other things that he believed in\r\nthe transmutation of metals and the possibility of an _elixir vitæ_,\r\nthat he boasted of having spirits at his command, one of which he\r\nkept imprisoned in the hilt of his sword and another in a jewel; that\r\nhe could make any one live forever; that he was proud to be called a\r\nmagician; and had boasted of having a regular correspondence with Galen\r\nin Hell. We read in sensational journals and magazines of to-day about\r\ncertain living persons having--or saying that they have--communion in\r\nthe shape of “interviews” with the dead; but this is too busy an age\r\nfor unnecessary contradictions and so such assertions are allowed to\r\npass. The same indifference may now and again have been exhibited in\r\nthe case of men like Paracelsus.\r\n\r\nSome things said of him may be accepted as being partially true, for\r\nhis was an age of mysticism, occultism, astrology, and all manner of\r\nstrange and weird beliefs. For instance it is alleged that he held that\r\nlife is an emanation from the stars; that the sun governed the heart,\r\nthe moon the brain, Jupiter the liver, Saturn the gall, Mercury the\r\nlungs, Mars the bile, Venus the loins; that in each stomach is a demon,\r\nthat the belly is the grand laboratory where all the ingredients are\r\napportioned and mixed; and that gold could cure ossification of the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that when in this age after centuries of progress such\r\nabsurd things are current Paracelsus is shewn in contemporary and later\r\nportraits with a jewel in his hand transcribed Azoth--the name given to\r\nhis familiar dæmon.\r\n\r\nThose who repeat _ad nauseam_ the absurd stories of his alchemy\r\ngenerally omit to mention his genuine discoveries and to tell of the\r\nwide scope of his teaching. That he used mercury and opium for healing\r\npurposes at a time when they were condemned; that he did all he could\r\nto stop the practice of administering the vile electuaries of the\r\nmediæval pharmacopœia; that he was one of the first to use laudanum;\r\nthat he perpetually held--to his own detriment--that medical science\r\nshould not be secret; that he blamed strongly the fashion of his time\r\nof accounting for natural phenomena by the intervention of spirits or\r\noccult forces; that he deprecated astrology; that he insisted on the\r\nproper investigation of the properties of drugs and that they should be\r\nused more simply and in smaller doses. To these benefits and reforms\r\nhis enemies answered that he had made a pact with the devil. For reward\r\nof his labours, his genius, his fearless struggle for human good he\r\nhad--with the exception of a few spells of prosperity--only penury,\r\nwant, malicious ill-fame and ceaseless attacks by the professors of\r\nreligion and science. He was an original investigator of open mind,\r\nof great ability and application, and absolutely fearless. He was\r\ncenturies ahead of his time. We can all feel grateful to that French\r\nwriter who said:\r\n\r\n    “Tels sont les services eminents que Paracelse a rendu à\r\n    l’humanité souffrante, pour laquelle il montra toujours le\r\n    dévouement le plus désintéressé; s’il en fut mal recompensé\r\n    pendant sa vie que sa mémoire au moins soit honorée.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAGLIOSTRO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe individual known to history as Comte Cagliostro, or more familiarly\r\nas Cagliostro, was of the family name of Balsamo and was received into\r\nthe Church under the saintly name of Joseph. The familiarity of history\r\nis an appanage of greatness in some form. Greatness is in no sense a\r\nquality of worth or morality. It simply points to publicity, and if\r\nunsuccessful, to infamy. Joseph Balsamo was of poor parentage in the\r\ntown of Palermo, Sicily, and was born in 1743. In his youth he did\r\nnot exhibit any talent whatever, such volcanic forces as he had being\r\nentirely used in wickedness--base, purposeless, sordid wickedness,\r\nfrom which devolved no benefit to any one--even to the criminal\r\ninstigator. In order to achieve greatness, or publicity, in any form,\r\nsome remarkable quality is necessary; Joseph Balsamo’s claim was based\r\nnot on isolated qualities but on a union of many. In fact he appears to\r\nhave had every necessary ingredient for this kind of success--except\r\none, courage. In his case however, the lacking ingredient in the\r\npreparation of his hell-broth was supplied by luck; though such luck\r\nhad to be paid for at the devil’s usual price--failure at the last.\r\nHis biographers put his leading characteristics in rather a negative\r\nthan a positive way--“indolent and unruly”; but as time went on the\r\nevil became more marked--even _ferae naturae_, poisonous growths,\r\nand miasmatic conditions have to manifest themselves or to cease to\r\nprevail. In the interval between young boyhood and coming manhood,\r\nBalsamo’s nature--such as it was--began to develop, unscrupulousness\r\nworking on an imaginative basis being always a leading characteristic.\r\nThe unruly boy shewed powers of becoming an unruly man, fear being the\r\nonly restraining force; and indolence giving way to wickedness. When\r\nhe was about fifteen he was sent to a monastery to learn chemistry and\r\npharmacy. The boy who had manifested a tendency to “grow downwards”\r\nfound the beginning of a kind of success in these studies in which,\r\nto the surprise of all, he exhibited a form of aptitude. Chemistry\r\nhas certain charms to a mind like his, for in its working are many\r\nstrange surprises and lurid effects not unattended with entrancing\r\nfears. These he used before long to his own pleasure in the concern\r\nof others. When he was expelled from the religious house he led a\r\ndissolute and criminal life in Palermo. Amongst other wickednesses he\r\nrobbed his uncle and forged his will. Here too, he committed a crime,\r\nnot devoid of a certain humorous aspect, but which had a reflex action\r\non his own life. Under promise of revealing a hidden treasure, he\r\npersuaded a goldworker, one Morano, to give him custody of a quantity\r\nof his wares. It was what, in criminal slang is called “a put-up job,”\r\nand was worked by a gang of young thieves with Balsamo at their head.\r\nHaving filled the soft head of the foolish goldsmith with ideas to\r\nsuit his purpose, Joseph brought him on a treasure hunt into a cave\r\nwhere he was shortly surrounded by the gang dressed as fiends, who,\r\nin the victim’s paralysis of fear, robbed him at their ease of some\r\nsixty ounces of gold. Morano, as might have been expected, was not\r\nsatisfied with the proceedings and vowed vengeance which he tried to\r\neffect later. Balsamo’s pusillanimity worked hand in hand with Morano’s\r\nvindictiveness, to the effect that the culprit incontinently absconded\r\nfrom his native town. He conferred the benefit of his presence on\r\nMessina where he was naturally attracted to a noted alchemist called\r\nAlthotas, to whom he became a sort of disciple. Althotas was a man\r\nof great learning, according to the measure of that time and his own\r\noccupation. He was skilled in Eastern tongues and an adept occultist.\r\nIt was said that he had actually visited Mecca and Medina in the\r\ndisguise of an Oriental prince. Having attached himself to Althotas,\r\nCagliostro went with him to Malta where he persuaded the Grand Master\r\nof the Knights to supply them with a laboratory for the manufacture of\r\ngold, and also with letters of introduction which he afterwards used\r\nwith much benefit to himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAGLIOSTRO]\r\n\r\nFrom Malta he went to Rome where he employed himself in forging\r\nengravings. Like other criminals, great and small, Comte Alessandro\r\nCagliostro--as he had now become by his own creation of nobility--had\r\na faculty of working hard and intelligently so long as the end he\r\naimed at was to be accomplished by crooked means. Work in the ordinary\r\nways of honesty he loathed and shunned; but work as a help to his\r\nnefarious schemes seemed to be a joy to him. Then he set himself up as\r\na wonder-worker, improving as he went on all the customs and tricks\r\nof that calling. He sold an elixir which he said had all the potency\r\nusually attributed to such compounds but with an added efficacy all its\r\nown. He pretended to be able to transmute metals and to make himself\r\ninvisible; indeed to perform all the wonders of the alchemist, the\r\n“cheap jack,” and the charlatan. At Rome he became acquainted with\r\nand married a very beautiful woman, Lorenza de Feliciani, daughter of\r\na lacemaker, round whom later biographers weave romances. According\r\nto contemporary accounts she seems to have been dowered with just\r\nsuch qualities as were useful in such a life as she had entered on.\r\nIn addition to great and unusual beauty she was graceful, passionate,\r\nseductive, clever, plausible, soothing, and attractive in all ways dear\r\nand convincing to men. She must have had some winning charm which\r\nhas lasted beyond her time, for a hundred years afterwards we find\r\nso level-headed a writer as Dr. Charles Mackay crediting her, quite\r\nunwarrantably with, amongst other good qualities, being a faithful\r\nwife. Her life certainly after her marriage was such that faithfulness\r\nin any form was one of the last things to expect in her. Her husband\r\nwas nothing less than a swindler of a protean kind. He had had a great\r\nnumber of aliases before he finally fixed on Comte de Cagliostro as\r\na _nomme de guerre_. He called himself successively Chevalier de\r\nFischio, Marquis de Melina (or Melissa), Marquis de Pellegrini, Comte\r\nde Saint-German, Baron de Belmonte; together with such names as Fenix,\r\nAnna, Harat. He wrote a work somewhat of the nature of a novel called\r\n_Le Grand Cophte_--which he found useful later when he was pushing his\r\nscheme of a sort of new Freemasonry. After his marriage he visited\r\nseveral countries, Egypt, Arabia, Persia, Poland, Russia, Greece,\r\nGermany; as well as such towns as Naples, Palermo, Rhodes, Strasbourg,\r\nParis, London, Lisbon, Vienna, Venice, Madrid, Brussels--in fact any\r\nplace where many fools were crowded into a small space. In many of\r\nthese he found use for the introductory letters of the Grand Master\r\nof the Knights of Malta, as well as those of other dupes from whom it\r\nwas his habit to secure such letters before the inevitable crash came.\r\nWherever he travelled he was accustomed to learn all he could of the\r\nmanners, customs and facts of each place he was in, thus accumulating\r\na vast stock of a certain form of knowledge which he found most useful\r\nin his chosen occupation--deceit. With regard to the last he utilised\r\nevery form of human credulity which came under his notice. The latter\r\nhalf of the eighteenth century was the very chosen time of strange\r\nbeliefs. Occultism became a fashion, especially amongst the richer\r\nclasses, with the result that every form of swindle came to the fore.\r\nAt this time Cagliostro, then nearing his fortieth year, began to have\r\na widespread reputation for marvellous cures. As mysticism in all sorts\r\nof forms had a vogue, he used all the tricks of the cult, gathering\r\nthem from various countries, especially France and Germany, where the\r\nfashion was pronounced. For this trickery he used all his knowledge of\r\nthe East and all the picturesque aids to credulity which he had picked\r\nup during his years of wandering; and for his “patter,” such medical\r\nterminology as he had learned--he either became a doctor or invented\r\na title for himself. This he interlarded with scraps of various forms\r\nof fraudulent occultism and all sorts of suggestive images of eastern\r\nquasi-religious profligacy. He took much of the imagery which he used\r\nin his rituals of fraud from records of ancient Egypt. This was a\r\npretty safe ground for his purpose, for in his time the Egypt of the\r\npast was a sealed book. It was only in 1799 that the Rosetta stone\r\nwas discovered, and more than ten years from then before Dr. Young was\r\nable to translate its three inscriptions--Hieroglyphic Demotic and\r\nGreek--whence Hieroglyphic knowledge had its source. _Omne ignotum\r\npro magnifico_ might well serve as a motto for all occultism, true\r\nor false. Cagliostro, whose business it was to deceive and mislead,\r\nunderstood this and took care that in his cabalistic forms Egyptian\r\nsigns were largely mixed with the pentagon, the signs of the Zodiac,\r\nand other mysterious symbols in common use. His object was primarily\r\nto catch the eye and so arrest the intelligence of any whom he wished\r\nto impress. For this purpose he went about gorgeously dressed and with\r\nimpressive appointments. In Germany for instance he always drove in\r\na carriage with four horses with courier and equerries in striking\r\nliveries. Happily there is extant a pen picture of him by Comte de\r\nBeugnot who met him in Paris at the house of the Comtesse de la Motte:\r\n\r\n    “of medium height and fairly fat, of olive colour, with short\r\n    neck and round face, big protruberant eyes, a snub nose with open\r\n    nostrils.”\r\n\r\nThis gives of him anything but an attractive picture; but yet M. de\r\nBeugnot says: “he made an impression on women whenever he came into a\r\nroom.” Perhaps his clothing helped, for it was not of a commonplace\r\nkind. De Beugnot who was manifestly a careful and intelligent observer\r\nagain comes to our aid with his pen:\r\n\r\n    “He wore a coiffure new in France; his hair parted in several\r\n    little cadenottes (queues or tresses) uniting at the back of the\r\n    head in the form known as a ‘catogan’ (hair clubbed or bunched).\r\n    A dress, French fashion, of iron grey, laced with gold, scarlet\r\n    waistcoat broidered with bold _point de spain_, red breeches, a\r\n    basket-hilted sword and a hat with white plumes!”\r\n\r\nAided by these adjuncts he was a great success in Paris whither he\r\nreturned in 1785. As an impostor he knew his business and played “the\r\ngame” well. When he was at work he brought to bear the influence of all\r\nhis “properties,” amongst them a tablecloth embroidered with cabalistic\r\nsigns in scarlet and the symbols of the Rosy Cross of high degree; the\r\nsame mysterious emblems marked the globe without which no wizard’s\r\natelier is complete.\r\n\r\nHere too were various little Egyptian figures--“ushabtui” he would\r\ndoubtless have called them had the word been in use in his day. From\r\nthese he kept his dupes at a distance, guarding carefully against\r\nany discovery. He evidently did not fear to hurt the religious\r\nsusceptibilities of any of his votaries, for not only were the crucifix\r\nand other emblems of the kind placed amongst the curios of his ritual,\r\nbut he made his invocation in the form of a religious ceremony, going\r\ndown on his knees and in all ways cultivating the emotions of those\r\nround him. He was aided by a young woman whom he described as pure\r\nas an angel and of great sensibility. The said young person kept\r\nher blue eyes fixed on a globe full of water. Then he proceeded to\r\nexpound the Great Secret which he told his hearers had been the same\r\nsince the beginning of things and whose mystery had been guarded by\r\nTemplars of the Rosy Cross, by Magicians, by Egyptians and the like.\r\nHe had claimed, as the Comte Saint-German said, that he had already\r\nexisted for many centuries; that he was a contemporary of Christ; and\r\nthat he had predicted His crucifixion by the Jews. As statements of\r\nthis kind were made mainly for the purpose of selling the elixir which\r\nhe peddled, it may easily be imagined that he did not shrink from\r\nlying or blasphemy when such seemed to suit his purpose. Daring and\r\nrecklessness in his statements seemed to further his business success,\r\nso prophecy--or rather boastings of prophecy _after the event_--became\r\npart of the great fraud. Amongst other things he said that he had\r\npredicted the taking of the Bastille. Such things shed a little light\r\non the methods of such impostors, and help to lay bare the roots or\r\nprinciples through which they flourish.\r\n\r\nAfter his Parisian success he made a prolonged tour in France. In la\r\nVendée he boasted of some fresh miracle--of his own doing--on each day;\r\nand at Lyons the boasting was repeated. Of course he occasionally had\r\nbad times, for now and again even the demons on whose acquaintance and\r\nhelp he prided himself did not work. In London after 1772, things had\r\nbecome so bad with him that he had to work as a house painter under\r\nhis own name. Whatever may have been his skill in his art this was\r\nprobably about the only honest work he ever did. He did not stick to\r\nit for long however, for four years afterwards he lost three thousand\r\npounds by frauds of others by whom he was introduced to fictitious\r\nlords and ladies. Here too he underwent a term of imprisonment for debt.\r\n\r\nNaturally such an impostor found in Freemasonry, which is a secret\r\ncult, a way of furthering his ends. With the aid of his wife, who all\r\nthrough their life together seems to have worked with him, he founded a\r\nnew branch of freemasonry in which a good many rules of that wonderful\r\norganisation were set at defiance. As the purpose of the new cult was\r\nto defraud, its net was enlarged by taking women into the body. The\r\nname used for it was the _Grand Egyptian Lodge_--he being himself the\r\nhead of it under the title of the _Cophte_ and his wife the _Grand\r\nPriestess_. In the ritual were some appalling ceremonies, and as these\r\nmade eventually for profitable publicity, the scheme was a great\r\nsuccess--and the elixir sold well. This elixir was the backbone of\r\nhis revenue; and indeed it would have been well worthy of success if\r\nit had been all that he claimed for it. Dispensers of elixirs are not\r\nusually backward in proclaiming the virtues of their wares; but in his\r\nvarious settings forth Cagliostro went further than others. He claimed\r\nnot only to restore youth and health and to make them perpetual,\r\nbut to restore lost innocence and effect a whole moral regeneration.\r\nNo wonder that he achieved success and that money rolled in! And no\r\nwonder that women, especially of the upper classes, followed him like\r\na flock of sheep! No wonder that a class rich, idle, pleasure-loving,\r\nand fond of tasting and testing new sensations, found thrilling moments\r\nin the great impostor’s mélange of mystery, religion, fear, and hope;\r\nof spirit-rapping and a sort of “black mass” in which Christianity\r\nand Paganism mingled freely, and where life and death, good and evil,\r\nwhirled together in a maddening dance.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, through his alleged sorcery that Cagliostro crept\r\ninto a place in history; but by the association of his name with a\r\nsordid crime which involved the names of some of the great ones of the\r\nearth. The story of the Queen’s Necklace, though he was acquitted at\r\nthe trial which concluded it, will be remembered when the vapourings\r\nof the unscrupulous quack who had escaped a thousand penalties justly\r\nearned, have been long forgotten. Such is the irony of history! The\r\nstory of the necklace involved Marie Antoinette, Cardinal Prince de\r\nRohan, Comte de la Motte--an officer of the private guard of “Monsieur”\r\n(the Comte d’Artois), his wife Jeanne de Valois, descended from Henry\r\nII through Saint-Remy, his natural son and Nicole de Savigny. Louis XV\r\nhad ordered from MM. Boemer et Bassange, jewellers to the Court of\r\nFrance, a beautiful necklace of extraordinary value for his mistress\r\nMadame du Barry, but died before it was completed. The du Barry was\r\nexiled by his successor, so the necklace remained on the hands of its\r\nmakers. It was, however, of so great intrinsic value that they could\r\nnot easily find a purchaser. They offered it to Marie Antoinette for\r\none million eight hundred thousand livres; but the price was too\r\nhigh even for a queen, and the necklace remained on hand. So Boemer\r\nshowed it to Madame de la Motte and offered to give a commission on\r\nthe sale to whoever should find a buyer. She induced her husband,\r\nComte de la Motte, to join with her in a plot to accomplish the sale.\r\nDe la Motte was a friend of Cagliostro, and he too was brought in as\r\nhe had influence with the Cardinal Prince de Rohan whom they looked\r\non as a likely person to be of service. He had his own ambitions to\r\nacquire influence over the queen and use her for political purposes as\r\nMazarin had used Anne of Austria. De Rohan was then a man of fifty--not\r\nconsidered much of an age in these days, but the Cardinal’s life had\r\nnot made for comparative longevity. He was in fact something of that\r\nclass of fool which has no peer in folly--an old fool; and Jeanne\r\nde la Motte fooled him to the top of his bent. She pretended to him\r\nthat Marie Antoinette was especially friendly to her, and shewed him\r\nletters from the queen to herself all of which had been forged for the\r\npurpose. As at this time Madame de la Motte had borrowed or otherwise\r\nobtained from the Cardinal a hundred and twenty thousand livres, she\r\nfelt assured he could be used for the contemplated fraud. She probably\r\nhad not ever even spoken to the queen but she was not scrupulous in\r\nsuch a small matter as one more untruth. She finally persuaded him that\r\nMarie Antoinette wished to purchase the necklace through his agency, he\r\nacting for her and buying it in her name. To aid in the scheme she got\r\nher pet forger, Retaux de Vilette, to prepare a receipt signed “Marie\r\nAntoinette de France.” The Cardinal fell into the trap and obtained\r\nthe jewel, giving to Boemer four bills due successively at intervals\r\nof six months. At Versailles de Rohan gave the casket containing the\r\nnecklace to Madame de la Motte, who in his presence handed it to a\r\nvalet of the royal household for conveyance to the queen. The valet\r\nwas none other than the forger Retaux de Vilette. Madame de la Motte\r\nsent to the Cardinal a letter by the same forger asking him to meet her\r\n(the queen) in the shrubbery at Versailles between eleven o’clock and\r\nmidnight. To complete the deception a girl was procured, one Olivia,\r\nwho in figure resembled the queen sufficiently to pass for her in the\r\ndusk. The meeting between de Rohan and the alleged queen was held at\r\nthe Baths of Apollo--to the deception and temporary satisfaction of the\r\nambitious churchman. When the first instalment for the purchase of the\r\nnecklace was due, Boemer tried to find out if the queen really had\r\npossession of the necklace--which had in the meanwhile been brought to\r\nLondon, it was said, by Comte de la Motte. As Boemer could not manage\r\nto get an audience with the queen he came to the conclusion that he\r\nhad been robbed, and made the matter public. This was reported to\r\nM. de Breteuil, Master of the King’s household, and an enemy of de\r\nRohan. De Breteuil saw the queen secretly and they agreed to act in\r\nconcert in the matter. Louis XVI asked for details of the purchase\r\nfrom Boemer, who told the truth so far as he knew it, producing as a\r\nproof the alleged receipt of the queen. Louis pointed out to him that\r\nhe should have known that the queen did not sign after the manner of\r\nthe document. He then asked de Rohan, who was Grand Almoner of France,\r\nfor his written justification. This being supplied, he had him arrested\r\nand sent to the Bastille. Madame de la Motte accused Cagliostro of the\r\ncrime, alleging that he had persuaded de Rohan to buy the necklace. She\r\nwas also arrested as were Retaux de Vilette, and, later on at Brussels,\r\nOlivia, who threw some light on the fraud. The King brought the whole\r\nmatter before Parliament, which ordered a prosecution. As the result of\r\nthe trial which followed, Comte de la Motte and Retaux de Vilette were\r\nbanished for life; Jeanne de la Motte was condemned to make _amende\r\nhonourable_, to be whipped and branded with V on both shoulders, and\r\nto be imprisoned for life. Olivia and Cagliostro were acquitted. The\r\nCardinal was cleared of all charges. Nothing seems to have been done\r\nfor the poor jewellers, who, after all, had received more substantial\r\ninjury than any of the others, having lost nearly two million livres.\r\n\r\nAfter the affair of the Necklace, Cagliostro spent a time in the\r\nBastille and when free, after some months, he and his wife travelled\r\nagain in Europe. In 1789 he was arrested at Rome by order of the\r\nInquisition and condemned to death as a Freemason. The punishment was\r\nlater commuted to perpetual imprisonment. He ended his days in the\r\nChâteau de Saint-Leon near Rome. His wife was condemned to perpetual\r\nseclusion and died in the Convent of Sainte-Appolive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESMER\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Frederic-Antoine Mesmer made an astonishing discovery which,\r\nhaving been tested and employed in therapeutics for a century, is\r\naccepted as a contribution to science, he is included in the list of\r\nimpostors because, however sound his theory was, he used it in the\r\nmanner or surrounded with the atmosphere of imposture. Indeed the\r\nimplement which he used in his practice, and which made him famous in\r\nfashionable and idle society, was set forth as having magic properties.\r\nHe belonged to the same period as Cagliostro, having been born but nine\r\nyears before him, in 1734, in Itzmang, Suabia; but the impostor pure\r\nand simple easily picked up the difference by beginning his life-work\r\nearlier and following it quicker with regard to results. Mesmer was not\r\nin any sense a precocious person. He was thirty-two years of age when\r\nhe took his degree of Doctor of Medicine at Vienna in 1765. However\r\nhe had already chosen his subject, animal magnetism as allied with\r\nmedical therapeutics. His early script under the title _De planetarum\r\ninfluxi_ is looked on as a legal reminiscence of judicial astronomy. He\r\nleft Vienna because, he said, of a cabal against him, and travelled\r\nin Europe, particularly in Switzerland, before he went to Paris to\r\nseek his fortune. This was in 1778, when he was some forty-four years\r\nof age; his reputation, which had been growing all the time, preceded\r\nhim. He was then a man of fine appearance, tall and important-looking\r\nand conveying a sense of calm power. He produced much sensation and was\r\nat once credited--not without his own will or intention--with magic\r\npower. He posed as a benefactor of humanity; a position which was at\r\nonce conceded to him, partly owing to the fact that an extraordinary\r\natmosphere of calm seemed to surround him, which with his natural\r\nair of assurance founded on self-belief, was able to convey to his\r\npatients a sense of hope which was of course very helpful in cases of\r\nnervous failure and depression. He settled in the Hotel Bouret near the\r\nPlace Vendôme and so in the heart of Paris; and at once undertook the\r\ntreatment of patients hitherto deemed incurable. Fashion took up the\r\nnew medical “craze” or “sensation,” and he at once became the vogue.\r\nIt was at this time of his life that Mesmer came to the parting of\r\nthe ways between earnest science and charlatanism. So far as we know\r\nhe still remained earnest in his scientific belief--as indeed he was\r\ntill the end of his days. Inasmuch as fashion requires some concrete\r\nexpression of its fancies, Mesmer soon used the picturesque side of\r\nhis brain for the service of fashionable success. So he invented an\r\nappliance which soon became the talk of the town. This was the famous\r\n_baquet magique_ or magic tub, a sort of covered bath, round which his\r\npatients were arranged in tiers. To the bath were attached a number\r\nof tubes, each of which was held by a patient, who could touch with\r\nthe end of it any part of his or her body at will. After a while the\r\npatients began to get excited, and many of them went into convulsions.\r\nAmongst them walked Mesmer, clad in an imposing dress suggestive of\r\nmystery and carrying a long wand of alleged magic power; often calming\r\nthose who had already reached the stage of being actually convulsed.\r\nHis usual method of producing something of the same effect at private\r\nséances, was by holding the hand of the patient, touching the forehead\r\nand making “passes” with the open hand with fingers spread out, and by\r\ncrossing and uncrossing his arms with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nA well-attended séance must have been a curious and not altogether\r\npleasant experience even to a wholesome spectator in full possession\r\nof his natural faculties. The whole surroundings of the place\r\ntogether with the previously cultured belief; the dusk and mystery;\r\nthe “mysterious sympathy of numbers”--as Dean Farrar called it; the\r\nspasmodic snapping of the cords of tensity which took away all traces\r\nof reserve or reticence from the men and women present; the vague\r\nterror of the unknown, that mysterious apprehension which is so potent\r\nwith the nerves of weak or imaginative people; and, it may be, the\r\nslipping of the dogs of conscience--all these combined to wreck the\r\nmoral and mental stability of those present, most of whom it must be\r\nremembered were actually ill, or imagined themselves to be so, which\r\ncame practically to the same thing. The psychical emotion was all very\r\nwell in the world of pleasure; but these creatures became physically\r\nsick through nervous strain. As described by the historian, they\r\nexpectorated freely a viscous fluid, and their sickness passed into\r\nconvulsions more or less violent; the women naturally succumbing more\r\nreadily and more quickly than the men. This absolute collapse--half\r\nepileptic, half hysterical--lasted varying periods according to the\r\ninfluence exercised by the presence of the calm, self-reliant operator.\r\nWe of a later age, when electric force has been satisfactorily\r\nharnessed and when magnetism as a separate power is better understood,\r\nmay find it hard to understand that the most advanced and daring\r\nscientists of the time--to whom Frederic-Antoine Mesmer was at least\r\nallied--were satisfied that magnetism and electricity were variants\r\nof the same mysterious force or power. It was on this theory that he\r\nseems to have worked his main idea to practical effect. The base of his\r\nsystem was animal magnetism, which could be superinduced or aided by\r\nmechanical appliances. He did not deceive himself into believing that\r\nhe had invented the idea but was quite willing to make the utmost use\r\nhe could of the discoveries and inventions of others. So far as we can\r\ngather his intentions from his acts, the main object in his scientific\r\nwork was to simplify the processes of turning emotion into effect.\r\nMagnetism had already been largely studied, and means were being\r\nconstantly sought for increasing its efficacy. Father Hehl had brought\r\nto a point of accepted perfection the manufacture of metal plates\r\nused in magnetic development, and these Mesmer used, with the result\r\nthat a violent controversy took place between them. So far as we can\r\nfollow after the lapse of time, Mesmer was consistent in his theories\r\nand their application. He held that the principle was one of planetary\r\ninfluence on the nervous system, and its manifestation was by a process\r\nof alternate intension and remission. It is possible that Mesmer--who\r\nheld that the heavenly bodies floated in a limitless magnetic fluid and\r\nthat he could make all substances, even such things as bread or dogs\r\nmagnetic--had in his mind the wisdom of following the same theory in\r\nmatters of lesser significance, though of more individual import, than\r\nthose of astronomy and its correlated sciences. If so he was wise in\r\nhis generation, for later electricians have found that the system of\r\nalternating currents especially at high tension, is of vast practical\r\nimportance. That he was practical in his use of the ideas of others\r\nis shown by the fact that he preferred the metallic plates of Father\r\nHehl to his own passes, even though the report of the Royal Commission\r\nruined him--at any rate checked his success, by stating that similar\r\neffects to those attending his passes could be produced by other\r\nmeans, and that such passes had no effect unless through the patient’s\r\nknowledge; in fact that it was all the work of imagination. Mesmer had\r\nbeen asked to appear before the Commission of the Faculty of Medicine\r\nappointed in 1784 to investigate and report, but he kept away. It would\r\nnot have injured any man to have appeared before such a commission if\r\nhis cause had been a good one. There were two such commissions. The\r\nfirst was of the leading physicians of Paris, and included such men\r\nas Benjamin Franklin, Lavoisier, the great chemist, and Bailly, the\r\nhistorian of astronomy.\r\n\r\nIt was distinctly to his disadvantage that Mesmer always kept at a\r\ndistance the whole corps of savants such as the Faculty of Medicine\r\nand the Academy of Sciences--for they would no doubt have accepted\r\nhis views, visionary though they were, if he could have shown any\r\nscientific base for them. True medical science has always been\r\nsuspicious of, and cautious regarding, empiricism. More than once he\r\nstood in his own light in this matter--whether through obstinacy or\r\ndoubt of his own theory does not matter. For instance, in Vienna,\r\nwhen his very existence as a scientist was at stake in the matter of\r\nthe effects of his treatment of Mademoiselle Paradis, he introduced a\r\nhumiliating clause in his challenge to the Faculty which caused them\r\nto refuse to accept it. Mademoiselle Paradis was blind and subject\r\nto convulsions. After treating her by his own method Mesmer said she\r\nwas cured. An oculist said, after testing, that she was as blind as\r\never, and her family said that she was still subject to convulsions.\r\nBut Mesmer persisted that she was cured, that there was a conspiracy\r\nagainst him, and that Mademoiselle Paradis had feigned. He challenged\r\nthe Faculty of Medicine on the subject of his discovery. Twenty-four\r\npatients were to be selected by the Faculty; of these twelve were to be\r\ntreated by Mesmerism and the other half by the means ordinarily in use.\r\nThe condition he imposed was that the witnesses were _not_ to be of the\r\nFaculty.\r\n\r\nAgain, when in answer to a request on his part that the French\r\nGovernment for the good of the community should subsidise him, a\r\nproposal was made to him, he did not receive it favourably. The request\r\nhe made to Marie Antoinette was that he should have an estate and\r\nchâteau and a handsome income, so that he might go on experimenting; he\r\nput the broad figures at four hundred or five hundred thousand francs.\r\nThe Government suggestion was that he should have a pension of twenty\r\nthousand francs and the Cross of Saint Michael (Knighthood) if he would\r\ncommunicate for public use, to a board of physicians nominated by the\r\nKing, such discoveries as he might make. After his refusal of the\r\nGovernment proposition Mesmer went to Spa, taking with him a number\r\nof his patients, and there opened a magnetic establishment where he\r\nrenewed his Paris success. He asked Parliament to hold an impartial\r\nexamination into the theory and working of Animal Magnetism. Foiled in\r\nhis scheme of state purchase on his own terms, he sold his secret to a\r\ngroup of societies, the members of which were to pay him a subscription\r\nof a hundred louis _per capita_. By this means he realised some 340,000\r\nlivres--representing to-day over a million. The associated body was\r\ncomposed of twenty-four societies called “societés de l’harmonie”--a\r\nsort of Freemasonry, under a Grand Master and Chiefs of the Order. A\r\nmember had to be at the time of admission twenty-five years of age, of\r\nhonest state and good name, not to smoke tobacco, and to pay an annual\r\nsubscription of at least sixty francs. There were three grades in the\r\nOrder: Initiated Associates, Corresponding Associates and Uninitiated.\r\nAmongst those belonging to the Society were such men as Lafayette,\r\nd’Espremisnil, and Berthollet the great chemist. Berthollet had,\r\nhowever, peculiar privileges, amongst which was the right of criticism.\r\nOn one occasion he had a “row” with Mesmer about his charlatanism.\r\n\r\nAt length the French public, wearied with his trickeries and angry with\r\nhis cupidity, openly expressed their dissatisfaction. Whereupon he left\r\nFrance, taking with him a fortune of three hundred and forty thousand\r\nfrancs. He went to England and thence to Germany. Finally he settled\r\ndown in Mersbourg in his native country, Suabia, where he died in 1815,\r\nat the age of eighty-one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE WANDERING JEW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legend of the Wandering Jew has its roots in a belief in the\r\npossibility of human longevity beyond what is natural and normal. It\r\nis connected with the story of the Crucifixion and the mysteries that\r\npreceded and followed it. Our account may find its starting point\r\nin a book of extraordinary interest which made a sensation in the\r\nseventeenth century and is still delightful reading. The passage which\r\nshould arrest our attention is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The story of the Wandering Jew is very strange and will hardly\r\n    obtain belief; yet there is a small account thereof set down by\r\n    _Matthew Paris_ from the report of an Armenian Bishop; who came\r\n    into this Kingdom about four hundred years ago, and had often\r\n    entertained this wanderer at his Table. That he was then alive,\r\n    was first called _Cartaphilus_, was keeper of the Judgment Hall,\r\n    whence thrusting out our Saviour with expostulation of his stay,\r\n    was condemned to stay until His return; was after baptized by\r\n    _Ananias_, and by the name of Joseph; was thirty years old in\r\n    the dayes of our Saviour, remembered the Saints that arised\r\n    with Him, the making of the Apostles’ Creed, and their several\r\n    peregrinations. Surely were this true, he might be an happy\r\n    arbitrator in many Christian controversies; but must impardonably\r\n    condemn the obstinacy of the Jews, who can contemn the Rhetorick\r\n    of such miracles, and blindly behold so living and lasting\r\n    conversions.”\r\n\r\nThe above is taken from the work entitled “Pseudoxia Epidemica” or\r\nEnquiries into very many Received Tenets and Commonly Presumed Truths\r\nby Sir Thomas Brown, Knight M.D. This was first published in 1640,\r\nso that the “about four hundred years ago” mentioned would bring the\r\nreport of the Armenian Bishop to the first half of the thirteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThus unless there be something of an authoritative character to upset\r\nthe theory, Matthew Paris must be taken as the first European narrator\r\nof the story. As a matter of fact the legend began just about the time\r\nthus arrived at. The great work in Latin, “_Historia Major_,” was begun\r\nby Roger of Wendover and completed in 1259 by the monk Matthew Paris.\r\nIt was not however published--in our ordinary sense of the word--until\r\nthe beginning of the year 1571 when Archbishop Parker took it in hand.\r\nIn the meantime the art of printing had been established and the new\r\nworld of thought and the reproduction of its fruit, had been developed\r\nfor common use. The _Historia Major_ was again printed in Zurich in\r\n1589 and 1606. The next English edition was in 1640. This was reprinted\r\nin Paris in 1644. The English edition of forty years later, 1684,\r\nwas a really fine specimen of typographic art. The authorship and\r\ndate of its printing are given: Matthaei Paris, Monachi Albanensis\r\nAngli London MDCLXXXIV. The script is in ecclesiastical Latin and\r\nto any modern reader is of a fresh and almost child-like sincerity\r\nwhich at once disarms doubt or hostile criticism. Indeed it affords\r\na good example of the mechanism of myth, showing how the littleness\r\nof human nature--vanity with its desire to shine and credulity in its\r\nprimitive form, are not subject to the controlling influences of either\r\nsacredness of subject or the rulings of common sense. It lends another\r\nmeaning to the quotation of Feste, the jester: _Cucullus non facit\r\nMonachum_. The artless narrative recorded in the _Historia Major_ makes\r\nthe whole inception of the myth transparent. In the monastery of St.\r\nAlbans a conversation is held by the monks on one side and the Armenian\r\nArchbishop--name not given, on the other. The interpreter in French\r\nis one Henri Spigurnel a native of Antioch, servant of the bishop.\r\nWe can gather even how Sir Thomas Brown M. D., doctor of Norwich and\r\nmost open-minded of scientists, lent himself, unconsciously, to the\r\npropagation of error. Brown reading, or hearing read, the work of\r\nMatthew Paris took it for granted that the record was correct and\r\ncomplete; and in his own book summarises or generalises the statements\r\nmade. For instance he says that the Armenian bishop had “often\r\nentertained this wanderer at his table” &c. Now it was his servant\r\nwho told the monks that the wandering Jew whom he had seen and heard\r\nspeaking many times dined at the table of his lord the Archbishop.\r\nThis at once minimises the value of the statement, for it does away\r\nat once with the respect due to the bishop’s high office and presumed\r\ncharacter, and with the sense of intellectual acumen and accuracy which\r\nmight be expected to emanate from one of his scholarship and quality.\r\nThus we get the story not from an accredited Bishop on a foreign\r\nmission--rare at the period and entrusted only to men of note--but from\r\nthe gossip of an Armenian lacquey or valet, trying to show his own\r\nimportance to a credulous serving brother of the monastery. And so,\r\nafter all, coming from this source it is to be accepted with exceeding\r\ncare--not to say doubt, even when seconded by the learned monastic\r\nscribe Matthew. So, also, for instance is his statement regarding the\r\nmanner in which the wanderer’s life is miraculously prolonged. It is\r\nto this effect. Each hundredth year Joseph falls into a faint so that\r\nhe lies for a time unconscious. When he recovers he finds that his age\r\nis restored to that which it was when the Lord suffered. Joseph, it\r\nmust be borne in mind, is the Wandering Jew, once Cartaphilus, who had\r\nkept Pilate’s judgment-hall. Then Matthew himself takes up the story\r\nand gives what professes to be the _ipsissima verba_ of the servant as\r\nto the conversation between Christ and Cartaphilus which culminated in\r\nthe terrible doom pronounced on the janitor who, from the showing, did\r\nnot seem a whit worse than any of the crowd present on that momentous\r\nday in Jerusalem. When Jesus, wearied already with carrying the great\r\ncross, leaned for a moment against the wall of the house of Cartaphilus\r\njust opposite the Judgment-hall the official said:\r\n\r\n    “‘Vade Jesu citius, vade, quid moraris?’ et Jesus severo vultu et\r\n    oculo respiciens eum, dixit: ‘Ego vado. Expectabis donec veniam.’”\r\n\r\nNow this is the whole and sole foundation of the individual Wandering\r\nJew. I say “individual” because there were before long other variants,\r\nand many old beliefs and fables were appropriated and used to back up\r\nthe marvellous story, invented by the Armenian servant and recorded\r\nby the learned monk, Matthew. Amongst these beliefs were those\r\nwhich taught that John the Baptist never died; that the aloe blooms\r\nonly once in a hundred years; and that the phœnix renews itself in\r\nfire. It is the tendency of legendary beliefs to group or nucleate\r\nthemselves as though there were a conscious and intentional effort at\r\nself-protection; and this, together with the natural human tendency to\r\nenlarge and elaborate an accepted idea, is responsible for much. The\r\nlegend started in the thirteenth century, took root and flourished, and\r\nin the very beginning of the seventeenth a variant blossomed. In this\r\nJoseph, originally Cartaphilus, became Ahasuerus. In the long pause the\r\nstory, after the manner of all things of earth, had grown, details not\r\nbeing lacking. The world was informed through the Bishop of Schleswig,\r\nhow in 1547, at Hamburg, a man was seen in the Cathedral who arrested\r\nattention--why we are not told. He was about fifty years of age, of\r\nreverend manner, and dressed in ragged clothes; he bowed low at the\r\nname of Christ. Many of the nobility and gentry who saw him recognised\r\nhim as one whom they had already seen in various places--England,\r\nFrance, Italy, Hungary, Persia, Spain, Poland, Moscow, Lieffland,\r\nSweden, Denmark, Scotland, &c. Inquiry being made of him, he told the\r\nBishop that he was Ahasuerus the shoe-maker of Jerusalem, who had been\r\npresent at the Crucifixion and had ever since been always wandering.\r\nHe was well posted in history, especially regarding the lives and\r\nsufferings of the Apostles, and told how, when he had directed Christ\r\nto move on, the latter had answered: “I will stand here and rest, but\r\nthou shalt move on till the last day.” He had been first seen, we are\r\ntold, at Lubeck.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that in an age of religious domination many of the\r\nlegends of Our Saviour seem to have been based on just such intolerant\r\nanger at personal slight as might have ruled a short-tempered,\r\nvain man. For instance look at one of the Christ legends which was\r\nreproduced in poor Ophelia’s distracted mind apropos of the owl, “They\r\nsay, the owl was a baker’s daughter.” The Gloucestershire legend runs\r\nthat Christ having asked for bread at baking time the mistress of the\r\nbakery took dough from the oven, but her daughter having remonstrated\r\nas to the size of the benefaction was turned into an owl. The penalty\r\ninflicted on the erring janitor of the Presidium is another instance.\r\n\r\nThe “Wandering Jew” legend once started, was hard to suppress. The\r\nthirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were the ages\r\nof Jew-baiting in the kingdoms of the West, and naturally the stories\r\ntook their colour from the prevailing idea.\r\n\r\nIn 1644, Westphalus learned from various sources that the Wandering Jew\r\nhealed diseases, and that he had said he was at Rome when it was burned\r\nby Nero; that he had seen the return of Saladin after his Eastern\r\nConquests; that he had been in Constantinople when Salimen had built\r\nthe royal mosque; that he knew Tamerlane the Scythian, and Scander\r\nBeg, Prince of Epirus; that he had seen Bajazet carried in a cage by\r\nTamerlane’s order; that he remembered the Caliphs of Babylon and of\r\nEgypt, the Empire of the Saracens, and the Crusades where he had known\r\nGodfrey de Bouillon. Amongst other things he seems to have apologised\r\nfor not seeing the Sack of Jerusalem, because he was at that time in\r\nRome at the Court of Vespasian.\r\n\r\nThe Ahasuerus version of the Wandering Jew legend seems to have been\r\nthe popular one amongst the commonalty in England. As an instance\r\nmight be quoted the broad-sheet ballad of 1670. It is not without even\r\nhistorical significance as it marks the measure of the time in many\r\nways. It is headed: “The Wandering Jew, or the Shoemaker of Jerusalem\r\nwho lived when Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ was crucified\r\nappointed by Him to live until Coming again. Tune, _The Lady’s Fall_\r\n&c. Licens’d and Enter’d according to order.” The imprint runs:\r\n“Printed by and for W. O. and sold by the Booksellers of Pyecorner and\r\nLondon-Bridge.”\r\n\r\nA century and a half later--1828--was published a much more pretentious\r\nwork on the same theme. This was a novel written by Rev. George Croly.\r\nIt was called: “Salathiel: a Story of the Past, the Present, the\r\nFuture.” It was published anonymously and had an immediate and lasting\r\nsuccess. It was founded on historical lines, the author manifestly\r\nbenefiting by the hints afforded by the work of that consummate liar\r\n(in a historical sense) Westphalus--or his informant. Croly was\r\na strange man with a somewhat abnormal faculty of abstraction. I\r\nused to hear of him from my father who was a friend of his about a\r\nhundred years ago. Being of gentle nature he did not wish to cause\r\nany pain or concern to his family or dependents; but at the same\r\ntime he, as a writer, had to guard himself against interruption and\r\nconsequent digression of his thoughts during the times he set apart\r\nfor imaginative work. So he devised a scheme which might often be\r\nput in practice with advantage by others similarly employed. When\r\nsettling down to a spell of such work--which as every creative\r\nwriter knows involves periods of mental abstraction though of bodily\r\nrestlessness--he would stick an adhesive wafer on his forehead. The\r\nrule of the house was that when he might be adorned in this wise no one\r\nwas to speak to him, or even notice him, except under special necessity.\r\n\r\nThe great vogue of _Salathiel_ lasted some ten or more years, when\r\nthe torch of the Wandering Jew was lighted by Eugene Sue the French\r\nnovelist who had just completed in the _Débats_ his story “Les Mystères\r\nde Paris.” As its successor he chose the theme adopted by Croly, and\r\nthe new novel _Le Juif-Errant_ ran with overwhelming success in the\r\n_Constitutionnel_.\r\n\r\nSue was what in modern slang is called “up to date.” He knew every\r\ntrick and dodge of the world of advertisement, and in conjunction\r\nwith his editor, Dr. Veron, he used them all. But he had good wares\r\nto exploit. His novels are really excellent, though the changes in\r\nsocial life and in religious, political and artistic matters, which\r\ntook place between 1844 and 1910, make some things in them seem out of\r\ndate. His great imagination, and his firm and rapid grasp of salient\r\nfacts susceptible of being advantageously used in narrative, pointed\r\nout to him a fresh road. It was not sufficient to the hour and place\r\nthat Cartaphilus--or Joseph--or Ahasuerus, or Salathiel or whatever he\r\nmight be called--should purge his sin by his personal sufferings alone.\r\nIn the legend, up to then accepted, he had long ago repented; so to\r\nincrease the poignancy of his sufferings, Sue took from the experience\r\nof his own time a means of embittering the very inmost soul of such an\r\none. He must be made to feel that his existence is a curse not only to\r\nhimself but to all the world. To this end he attached to the Wanderer\r\nthe obligation of carrying a fell disease. The quick brain of the great\r\n_feuilletonist_ seized the dramatic moment for utilising the occasion.\r\nA dozen years before, the frightful spread of the cholera, which had\r\nonce again wrought havoc, woke the whole world to new terror. Some one\r\nof uneasy mind who found diversion in obscure comparisons, noted from\r\nthe records of the disease that its moving showed the same progress in\r\na given direction as a man’s walking. A hint was sufficient for the\r\npublic who eagerly seized the idea that the Wandering Jew had, from the\r\nfirst recorded appearance of the cholera, been the fated carrier of\r\nthat dreaded pestilence. The idea seemed to be a dramatic inspiration\r\nand had prehensile grasp. Great as had been the success of the\r\n_Mysteries of Paris_, that of _The Wandering Jew_ surpassed it, and for\r\nhalf a century the new novel kept vividly before its readers the old\r\ntradition, and so brought it down to the present.\r\n\r\nWe may now begin to ask ourselves who and where in this great deception\r\nwas the impostor. Who was the guilty one? And at first glance we\r\nare inclined to say “There is none! Whatever the error, mistake,\r\ndeception, or false conclusion, there has been no direct guilt.” This\r\nis to presuppose that guilt is of conscious premeditation; and neither\r\nintention of evil nor consciousness of guilt is apparent. In legal\r\nphrase the _mens rea_ is lacking.\r\n\r\nIt is a purely metaphysical speculation whether guilt is a necessary\r\nelement of imposition. One is an intellectual experience, the other is\r\nan ethical problem; and if we are content to deal with responsibility\r\nfor another’s misdoing, the question of the degree of blameworthiness\r\nis sufficient. Let us try a process of exclusions. The complete list of\r\nthose who had a part in the misunderstanding regarding the myth of the\r\nWandering Jew, leaving out the ostensible fictionists, were:\r\n\r\nThe Abbot of St. Albans, the Archbishop of Armenia, the interpreter,\r\nthe Archbishop’s servant, the monks or laybrothers who singly or in\r\ngeneral conversed with any of the above; and finally Matthew Paris who\r\nrecorded the story in its various phases. Of these we must except from\r\nall blame both the Abbot of St. Albans and the Archbishop of Armenia,\r\nboth of whom were good grave men of high character and to each of whom\r\nhad been entrusted matters of the highest concern. The interpreter\r\nseems to have only fulfilled his office with exactitude; if in any way\r\nor part he used his opportunity to impose on the ignorance of the host\r\nor the guest there is no record, no suggestion of it. Matthew Paris\r\nwas a man of such keenness of mind, of such observation and of such\r\ncritical insight, that even to-day, after a lapse of over five hundred\r\nyears, and the withstanding of all the tests of a new intellectual\r\nworld which included such inventions as printing and photography, he\r\nis looked upon as one of the ablest of chroniclers. Moreover he put no\r\nnew matter nor comments of his own into the wonderful and startling\r\nnarratives which he was called on to record. He even hints at or infers\r\nhis own doubt as to the statements made. The monks, servants and others\r\nmentioned generally, were merely credulous, simple people of the time,\r\nwith reverence for any story regarding the _Via Dolorosa_, and respect\r\nor awe for those in high places.\r\n\r\nThere remains but the servant of the foreign Archbishop. It is to\r\nhim that we must look for any outrage on our normal beliefs. He was\r\nmanifestly a person of individually small importance--even Matthew\r\nParis whose trained work it was to record with exactness, and whose\r\nduty it therefore was to sustain or buttress main facts, did not think\r\nit necessary or worth while to mention his name. He had in himself\r\nnone of the dignity, honour, weight, learning or position of the\r\nnoble of the Church who was the Abbot’s guest. He was after all but\r\na personal servant; probably one of readiness and expediency with a\r\nquick imagination and a glib tongue. One who could wriggle through a\r\ndifficult position, defend himself with ready acquiescence, gain his\r\nends of securing his master’s ease, and find all necessary doors open\r\nthrough the bonhommie of his fellow servitors. Such an one accustomed\r\nto the exigencies of foreign travel, must have picked up many quaint\r\nconceits, legends and japes, and was doubtless a _persona grata_ liked\r\nand looked up to by persons of his own class, sanctified to some little\r\nextent by the reflected glory of his master’s great position. It is\r\nmore than likely that he had been the recipient of many confidences\r\nregarding legend and conjecture concerning sacred matters, and that any\r\nsuch legend as he spoke of would have been imparted under conditions\r\nfavourable to his own comfort. After the manner of his kind his\r\nstories doubtless lost nothing in the telling and gained considerably\r\nin the re-telling. Even in the short record of Matthew Paris, there\r\nis evidence of this in the way in which, after the striking story of\r\nCartaphilus has been told, he returns to the matter again, adding\r\npicturesque and inconclusive details of the manner of the centennial\r\nrenewal of the wanderer’s youth. The simplest analysis here will show\r\nthe falsity of the story; what the great logician Archbishop Whately\r\nalways insisted on--“internal evidence”--is dead against the Armenian\r\nvalet, courier, or servitor. He gave circumstantial account of the\r\nperiodic illness, loss of memory, and recovery of youth on the part\r\nof Cartaphilus; but there is no hint of how he came to know it, and\r\nCartaphilus could not have told him, nor anybody else. We may, I think,\r\ntake it for granted that no other mere mortal was present, for, had any\r\nother human being been there, all the quacksalvers of a thousand miles\r\naround would have moved heaven and earth to get information of what was\r\ngoing on, since in mediæval days there was nearly as much competition\r\nin the world of charlatanism as there is to-day in the world of sport.\r\nThe Armenian was much too handy a man at such a crisis to be found out,\r\nso we may give him the benefit of the doubt and at once credit him\r\nwith invention. It is hard to understand--or even to believe without\r\nunderstanding--that so mighty a legend and one so tenacious of life,\r\narose and grew from such a beginning. And yet it is in accord with\r\nthe irony of nature that one who has unintentionally and unwittingly\r\nachieved a publicity which would dwarf the malign reputation of\r\nHerostratus should have his name unrecorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. JOHN LAW\r\n\r\nTHE MISSISSIPPI SCHEME AND ITS ANTECEDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great “Mississippi Scheme” which wrought havoc on the French in\r\n1720 is the central and turning point in the history of John Law, late\r\nof Lauriston, Controller-General of Finance in France. His father,\r\nWilliam Law (grand nephew of James Law, Archbishop of Glasgow) was a\r\ngoldsmith in that city.\r\n\r\nAs in the seventeenth century the goldsmiths were also the bankers and\r\nmoneylenders of the community, a successful goldsmith might be looked\r\non as on the highroad to great fortune. To William Law in 1671 was\r\nborn his first son John, who had considerable natural talent in the\r\nway of mathematics--and a nature which was such as to nullify their\r\nuse. As a youth he showed proficiency in arithmetic and algebra, but\r\nas he was also in those early days riotous and dissipated, we may\r\nfairly come to the conclusion that he did not use his natural powers\r\nto their best advantage. He was already a gambler of a marked kind.\r\nBefore he was of age he was already in debt and was squandering his\r\npatrimony. He sold the estate of Lauriston which his thrifty father\r\nhad acquired, and gave himself over to a life of so-called pleasure.\r\nHis mother, who had family ambitions, bought the estate so that it\r\nmight remain in the family of its new possessors. He removed himself\r\nto London where within a couple of years he was sentenced to death for\r\nmurder--not a vulgar premeditated murder for gain, but the unhappy\r\nresult of a duel wherein he had killed his opponent, a boon companion,\r\none Austin who had acquired the soubriquet of “Beau” Austin. Through\r\nsocial influence the death penalty was commuted for imprisonment,\r\nand the crime only regarded as manslaughter. He had however to deal\r\nwith the relatives of the dead man who were naturally vindictive. One\r\nof them entered an appeal against the commutation of the sentence.\r\nLaw, with the characteristic prudence of his time and nationality,\r\ndid not wait for the leisurely settlement of the legal process, but\r\nescaped to the continent where he remained for some years sojourning\r\nin various places. Being naturally clever and daring he seems to have\r\ngenerally fallen on his feet. Whilst in Holland he became secretary\r\nto an important official in the diplomatic world, from which service\r\nhe drifted into an employment with the Bank of Amsterdam. Here the\r\nnatural bent of his mind found expression. Banking in some of its\r\nforms is gambling, and as he was both banker and gambler--one by\r\ninherited tendency and the other by personal disposition--he began to\r\nfind his vogue, addressing himself seriously to the intricacies and\r\npossibilities of the profession of banking. He was back in Scotland in\r\n1701 (a risky venture on his part for his felony had not been “purged”)\r\nand published a pamphlet, “_Proposals and Reasons for constituting a\r\nCouncil of Trade in Scotland_.” This he followed up after some years,\r\nwith another pamphlet, “_Money and Trade considered, with a proposal\r\nfor supplying the Nation with Money_”; and in the same year (1709) he\r\npropounded to the Scotch Parliament a scheme for a State Bank on the\r\nsecurity of land--a venture which on being tried speedily collapsed.\r\nThis, like other schemes of that period, was based on the issue and use\r\nof paper money.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN LAW]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, and for five or six years afterwards, he was\r\ntravelling variously throughout Europe, occupying himself with\r\nformulating successive schemes of finance, and in gambling--a process\r\nin which he, being both skilled and lucky, amassed a sum of over a\r\nhundred thousand pounds. He had varying fortunes, however, and was\r\nexpelled from several cities. He was not without believers in his\r\npowers. Amongst them was the Earl of Stair, then Ambassador to France,\r\nwho allured by his specious methods of finance, suggested to the Earl\r\nof Stanhope that he might be useful in devising a scheme for paying off\r\nthe British National Debt. After the death of Louis XIV, in 1715, he\r\nsuggested to the Duke of Orleans, the Regent for the young King (Louis\r\nXV), the formation of a State Bank. The Regent favoured the idea, but\r\nhis advisers were against it; it was, however, agreed that Law might\r\nfound a bank with power to issue notes and accept deposits. This was\r\ndone by Letters Patent and the _Banque Générale_ came into existence in\r\n1710, and was an immediate success. Its principle was to issue paper\r\nmoney which was to be repayable by coin. Its paper rose to a premium\r\nin 1716; in 1717 there was a decree that it was to be accepted in the\r\npayment of taxes. This created a new form of cheap money, with the\r\nresult that there was a great and sudden extension of industry and\r\ntrade. From this rose the idea of a new enterprise--The Mississippi\r\nCompany--which was to outvie the success of the East India Company\r\nincorporated by Charter in 1600 under the title of “The Governor and\r\nCompany of the Merchants of London trading to the East Indies,” which\r\nafter periods of doubtful fortune, and having become consolidated with\r\nits rival “The General East India Company”--partially in 1702, and\r\ncompletely in 1708, under the somewhat elephantine name of “The United\r\nCompany of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies”--was now\r\na vast organization of national importance. To the new French Company\r\nfor exploiting the Mississippi Valley was made over Louisiana (which\r\nthen included what were afterwards the States of Ohio and Missouri).\r\nThe Decree of Incorporation was issued in 1717. The Parliament at\r\nParis presently grew jealous of such a concession having been given\r\nto a foreigner; and the next year a rumour went about that Parliament\r\nwas about to have him arrested, tried, and hanged. The Regent met\r\nthe parliamentary resistance by making (1718) the _Banque Générale_\r\ninto the _Banque Royale_--the King guaranteeing the notes. Law was\r\nmade Director General; but he was unable to prevent the Regent from\r\nincreasing the issue of paper money, by which means he managed to\r\nsatisfy dishonestly his own extravagance. It was a fiscal principle\r\nof the time that the State accountants did not go behind the King’s\r\nreceipt--the _acquit de comptant_ as it was called.\r\n\r\nThe Western Company was enlarged in 1718 by a grant of a monopoly of\r\ntobacco, and of the rights of trading ships and merchandise of the\r\nCompany of Senegal. In 1719, the _Banque Royale_ absorbed the rights of\r\nthe East India and China Companies, and then assumed the all-embracing\r\ntitle of _Compagnie des Indes_. The next year it took in the African\r\nCompany; and so through that the whole of the non-European trade of\r\nFrance. In 1719, the management of the Mint was handed over to Law’s\r\nCompany; and he was thus enabled to manipulate the coinage. In the\r\nsame year he had undertaken to pay off the French National Debt, and\r\nso become the sole creditor of the Nation. He already exercised the\r\nfunctions of Receiver General and had revenue-farming abolished in its\r\nfavour. He now controlled the collection and disposal of the whole of\r\nthe State taxation. At this stage of his adventure, Law seemed a good\r\nfiscal administrator. He repealed or reduced pressing taxes on useful\r\ncommodities, and reduced the price of necessaries by forty per cent.\r\nso that the peasants could increase the value of their holdings and\r\ntheir crops without fear of coming later into the remorseless grip of\r\nthe tax-farmer under the infamous _metayer_ system. Free-trade was in\r\nthe Provinces practically established. This, so far as it went, was all\r\nLaw’s doing. Turgot, who later got credit for what had been done, only\r\ncarried out what the Scotch financier had planned.\r\n\r\nLaw had promised high dividends to the speculators in his scheme, and\r\nhad so far paid them; so it was no wonder that “The System” raised its\r\nhead again. In 1719-20, all France seemed to flock to Paris to such a\r\ndegree and with such unanimity of purpose, that it was difficult to\r\nobtain room to go on with the necessary work of the Mississippi Scheme.\r\nIn such matters, resting on human greed which throws all prudence to\r\nthe winds, the pressure is always towards the centre; and the narrow\r\nstreet of Quin cam poix became a seething mass, day and night, of\r\nspeculators in a hurry to buy shares. The time for trying to sell them\r\nhad not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nNaturally such a locality rose in value, and as demand emphasises\r\npaucity of space, extraordinary prices ruled. Even a small share in\r\nthe lucky street, where fortunes could be made in an hour, rose to\r\nfabulous value. Houses formerly letting for forty pounds a year now\r\nfetched eight hundred pounds per month. And no wonder, when shares of\r\nthe face value of five hundred livres sold for ten thousand! When there\r\nis such an overwhelming desire to buy, then is the opportunity for\r\nsellers to realise, and the time for such speculation on the one side,\r\nand for such commerce on the other, is naturally short and the need\r\npressing.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1720 everything seemed to be increasing in a sort\r\nof geometric ratio. After a dividend of forty per cent. had been\r\ndeclared, shares of five hundred value rose to eighteen thousand.\r\nGreed, and the opportunity for satisfying its craving, turned the\r\nheads of ordinarily sensible people. The whole world seemed mad. It\r\nappeared right enough that the financial wonder-worker who had created\r\nsuch a state of things should be loaded with additional honours. It\r\nwas only scriptural that he who had already multiplied his talents\r\nshould be entrusted with more. There was universal rejoicing when\r\nJohn Law--exiled foreigner and condemned murderer--was appointed, in\r\nJanuary, 1720, Controller-General of the whole finances of France.\r\nNaturally enough, even the hard head of the canny Scot began to\r\nmanifest symptoms of giving way in the shape of becoming _exalté_. And\r\nnaturally enough his enemies--financial, political and racial--did not\r\nlose the opportunities afforded them of taking advantage of it. Tongues\r\nbegan to wag, and all sorts of rumours, some of them reconcilable with\r\ncommon sense and easily credible, others outrageous, began to go about.\r\nLord Stair reported that Law had boasted that he would raise France on\r\nthe ruins of England and Holland, to a greater height than she had ever\r\nreached; that he could crush the East India Company and even destroy\r\nBritish trade and credit when he chose. Stair resented this, and he and\r\nLaw from being close friends became enemies. To appease the incensed\r\nand at present all-powerful Law, the powers that were recalled Lord\r\nStair.\r\n\r\nOn 23 February 1720, the _Compagnie des Indes_ and the _Banque Royale_\r\nwere united, thus linking the ends of the financial chain. “The System”\r\nwas now complete.\r\n\r\nWhen Aladdin set the Genius, who had hitherto worked so willingly, the\r\nfinal task of hanging a roc’s egg in the centre of the newly-created\r\npalace, he brought the whole structure tumbling about his ears. So it\r\nwas with John Law and the egregious Mississippi Scheme. His idea was\r\ncomplete and perfect. But the high sun when it reaches its meridianal\r\nsplendour begins from that instant its downward course.\r\n\r\nThe reaction was not long in manifesting itself. Usually in such\r\nmatters there is a pause before the great driving-wheels reverse\r\ntheir motion, and the backward motion, beginning slowly, gathers way\r\nas it progresses. But in this case human intelligence and not soulless\r\nmachinery was the propulsive force of reaction. The speculators had\r\nbegun to work before the onward movement had come to an end or even\r\nbegun to slacken. They were loaded up with a vast amount of stocks\r\nwhose value, even if there had been money to redeem them, was severely\r\nlimited, whereas they had purchased at prices varying between the\r\nfirst rise above nominal value and that reached by the last desperate\r\nspeculator. It is not wise to hold such inflated stock too long, and in\r\na crisis sailing-master Wisdom orders Quarter-master Caution to take\r\na trick at the helm. When the bare idea of unification of financial\r\ninterests was mooted, the wise holders of stock commenced to unload.\r\nWhen this movement began its progress was rapid--so long as there was\r\nanything to be moved. The first class to feel it were the bankers. The\r\nspecie ran out like the pent-up water from a burst reservoir, till in\r\nan incredibly short time there was not sufficient remaining to afford\r\nthe money-change needed in daily life. The advisers and officials of\r\nthe State, seriously alarmed, began at once to take strong measures\r\nsupported by royal decrees. Then as ruin began to stare the whole\r\nnation in the face more and more with every hour, desperate expedients\r\nwere resorted to. The value of the currency was made by every\r\nstratagem, dishonest trick, and unscrupulous exercise of power, to\r\nfluctuate so that such differences or margins as arose might be grasped\r\nforthwith for national use. Payments in bullion, except for very small\r\namounts, were forbidden. The possession of anything over five hundred\r\nlivres in specie was deemed an offence punishable by confiscation,\r\npartial or wholesale, and by fine. Domiciliary visits were paid to seek\r\nevidence of offence and to enforce the new laws, and informers in this\r\nconnection were well paid.\r\n\r\nThen began a war, between public oppression and individual trickery,\r\nto defend acquired rights and evade unjust demands. The holders of\r\npaper money, unable to realise in specie, tried to protect themselves\r\nby purchasing goods of intrinsic value. Precious metals, jewels, and\r\nsuch like were bought in such quantities that the supplies diminished\r\nand the prices grew, until to avoid immediate ruin, such purchases\r\nwere proclaimed illegal and prohibited. Then ordinary commodities of\r\nlesser values were tried as means of barter, till their prices too\r\nrose to such an extent that trade was paralysed. In order to meet the\r\ngrowing danger a still more desperate expedient was resorted to. A\r\ndecree was issued the effect of which would be to reduce--gradually\r\nit was hoped--the obligation of bank notes to one-half their nominal\r\nvalue. This completed the panic, for here was a position which could\r\nnot be guarded against by any prudence or wisdom. No one could\r\nhenceforth by any possibility be financially safe. The speculators who\r\nhad already realised were alone safe. _Bona fide_ investors, if not\r\nalready overwhelmed by disaster, saw the tide of ruin rising rapidly\r\naround them. Nothing within the power of the state could now be done\r\nto check or even lessen the state of panic; not even the reversal of\r\nthe late decree in ten days after its issue. To make matters still\r\nworse the Banque at this very time suspended payment. Probably in\r\na wild endeavour to do _something_ which would avert odium from\r\nitself by saddling the responsibility on someone else, the Government\r\nprocured the dismissal of Law from the Controller-Generalship of\r\nFinance. However--strange to say--he was very soon appointed by the\r\nRegent as Intendant-General of Commerce and Director of the ruined\r\nbank. The much-vaunted, idolised, and believed-in “System” had now\r\nfallen hopelessly and was ruined forever. Law was everywhere attacked\r\nand insulted with such unmitigated rancour that he had to leave the\r\ncountry. He had invested the bulk of the great fortune which he had by\r\nnow acquired, in estates in France; and these together with everything\r\nelse that he had were now confiscated.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the same year, 1720, whilst he was at Brussels he was\r\nasked by the command of the Czar (Peter), to administer the finances of\r\nRussia, but declined. After this episode, grateful to a broken man, he\r\nspent a couple of years wandering about Italy and Germany and probably\r\ngaming a fluctuating income through gambling. Next he was to be found\r\nin Copenhagen where he had sought sanctuary from his creditors. Next\r\nyear there was an outward change in his status, when he went to\r\nEngland, on a ship of war, at the invitation of the Government. There\r\nhe was presented to George I. Somewhat to his chagrin he was denounced\r\nin the House of Lords as a Catholic--(he had abjured his old belief of\r\nProtestantism before accepting the high office of Controller-General\r\nof Finances in 1720)--and an adherent of the Pretender. He pleaded in\r\nthe King’s Bench the Royal pardon for the murder of Beau Austin which\r\nhad been sent to him in 1719. He spent the succeeding few years in\r\nEngland whence he corresponded with the Duke of Orleans. He expected\r\nto be recalled to France but his hope was never realised. He wished to\r\ngo to the Continent but was practically a prisoner in England, fearing\r\nto leave it lest he should be arrested by his creditors, amongst whom\r\nwas the new French East India Company which had been reconstructed on\r\nthe ruins of the old. In 1725 Sir Robert Walpole, then Prime Minister,\r\nasked Lord Townshend, the Secretary of State, to give Law a King’s\r\ncommission of some sort, so that such might serve for his protection.\r\nIn the same year he went to Italy. He died in Venice in 1729, in what,\r\ncompared with his former state, was poverty. To the last he was a\r\ngambler, always ready to take long risks for a prospect, however\r\nremote, of large gain. A story is told that in his last years he\r\nwagered his last thousand pounds to a shilling (20,000 to 1) against\r\nthe throwing of double sixes six consecutive times. The law of chances\r\nwas with him and naturally he won. He renewed his wager but the\r\nauthorities would not allow the further gamble to take place.\r\n\r\nJohn Law married, quite early in life, the daughter of the Earl of\r\nBanbury and widow of Mr. Seignior. His widow died in 1747. Some of\r\nthe members of his family were not undistinguished; his son died a\r\nColonel in the Austrian service; and one of his nephews became Comte de\r\nLauriston and rose to be a General in the French army and Aide-de-Camp\r\nto the first Napoleon. He was made a Marshal of France by Louis XVIII.\r\n\r\nJohn Law was a handsome and distinguished-looking man, blonde, with\r\nsmall dark grey eyes and fresh complexion. He made an agreeable\r\nimpression on strangers. Saint-Simon, the social historian, gave him a\r\ngood character: “innocent of greed and knavery, a mild good man whom\r\nfortune had not spoilt.” Others of his time regarded him as a pioneer\r\nof modern statesmanship.\r\n\r\nHow is it then that such a man must be set down an impostor? In\r\nhistorical perspective as an impostor he must be regarded, though not\r\nas such in the narrowest view. The answer is that his very prominence\r\nsits amongst his judges. Lesser men, and greater men of lesser\r\nposition, might well stand excused in matters wherein he is accorded\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\n    “That in the Captain’s but a choleric word\r\n    Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.”\r\n\r\nIf, when a man plays a game wherein life and death and the fortunes\r\nof many thousands are involved, it behoves him to be at least\r\ncareful, much greater is his responsibility where the prosperity\r\nand happiness of nations are at stake. Had Law merely started new\r\ntheories of finance, and had they gone wrong, he might well claim,\r\nand be accorded, excuse. But his were inventions of what, in modern\r\nslang, is called “get-rich-quick” principles. Not only did Law not\r\nenrich human life--with one exception, that of enlarging the currency\r\nin use--or add to the sum total of human well-being and happiness; he\r\neven neglected to show that forethought and consideration for others\r\nwhich in all honour ought to be exercised by the deviser and controller\r\nof great risks. He was a gambler, and a gambler only. He merely put\r\ninto the pockets of some persons that which he had taken out of the\r\npockets of others; and in doing so showed no consideration for the\r\npoor, the thrifty, the needy--for any of those whose contentment and\r\nhappiness depend on such as are in high places and dowered in some\r\nway with productive powers. The soulless uneducated churl who does an\r\nhonest day’s work does more for humanity than the genius who merely\r\nshifts about the already garnered wealth of ages. John Law posed as\r\na benefactor and accepted all the benefits that accrued to him from\r\nthe praises of those who followed in his wake and gleaned the rich\r\nwastage of his empire-moving theories and schemes. Financiers of Law’s\r\ntype no more benefit a country or enrich a people than do the hordes\r\nof wasters and “tape”-betting men who prey on labour as locusts do on\r\nthe crops. If they wish not to do unnecessary harm--which is putting\r\ntheir duty at the lowest possible estimate--they should at least try to\r\navoid repeating the errors which have wrecked others. A brief glance at\r\nthe wreckage which lay well within the Scotch gambler’s vision, will\r\nshow how he shut his eyes deliberately not only to facts, but to the\r\nmany correlations of cause and effect. Before his Mississippi Scheme\r\nwas formulated, there had been experience of banking enterprises, of\r\nschemes for mercantile combination and for the exploitation of capital,\r\nof adventurous dealings in the developments of countries new and more\r\nor less savage, East and West and South.\r\n\r\nThe following list will typify. Of all these John Law had knowledge\r\nsufficient to judge of difficulties to be encountered in the early\r\nstages, of dangers not only incidental to the things themselves, but\r\nbased deep in human nature.\r\n\r\n  The East India Company founded in 1600\r\n  The Bank of England founded in 1694\r\n  The Africa Company founded in 1695\r\n  The Darien Company founded in 1695\r\n\r\nA glance at each of these, all of which were within the scope and\r\nknowledge of Law, their aims, formation and development, up to the time\r\nspoken of, can hardly fail to be illuminative. The sixteenth century\r\nhad been an age of adventure and discovery; the seventeenth of the\r\nfoundation of great commercial enterprise, of conception of ideas, of\r\nthe constructive beginnings of things. The time for development had\r\ncome with the eighteenth; and now care and forethought, prudence and\r\nresource, were the preparations for success.\r\n\r\nThe East India Company was in reality the pioneer of corporate\r\ntrading, and as for nearly a hundred years it was in a measure alone\r\nin its scale of magnitude, its experiences could well serve as\r\nexemplar, guide, and danger signal. It was based on that surest of all\r\nundertakings, natural growth. It came into existence because it was\r\nwanted, and from no other cause. Its very name, its modest capital, its\r\nself-protective purpose make for understanding.\r\n\r\nIn its Charter of Incorporation its purpose was indicated in the name:\r\n“The Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading to the East\r\nIndies.” Its capital was £70,000, which though a large sum for those\r\ndays, was, according to our modern lights, an almost ridiculously small\r\nsum for the object then before it, and to which it ultimately attained.\r\nThe time was ripe for just such an undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Vervins (1598) which left both France and Spain free\r\nto look after their domestic concerns, was immediately followed by\r\nthe Edict of Nantes (1599) which gave religious liberty to France,\r\nand such a new freedom is always followed by national expansion.\r\nBy this time Spain--the explorer or conqueror--and Holland--the\r\npatient organiser--held Eastern commerce in their hands. England\r\nhad been gradually making a commerce of her own in the Indies, and\r\nall that was required was an official acknowledgment, so that the\r\nthunder of her guns should, when required, follow the creaking of her\r\ncordage. From the story of this great enterprise, through its first\r\ntwenty-five years, could be drawn the lesson of such schemes as Law\r\nwas now formulating. Though it had succeeded, in spite of Dutch and\r\nPortuguese opposition, in establishing “factories” when the historic\r\nmassacre by the Dutch at Amboyna in the Molucca Islands, took place\r\nin 1725, the Eastern Company seemed near its dissolution. It was not\r\ntill the establishment of the Hooghly factory in 1742 that things\r\nbegan to look up. After that, fortune favoured the Company more\r\nthan she had appeared likely to do at the start. The marriage of\r\nCharles II to Catherine of Braganza in 1661 brought progress in its\r\ntrain. Catherine’s dower, which included Bombay and so put a part of\r\nPortugal’s later possessions in British keeping, greatly stimulated the\r\nEast India Company which thenceforth was able to weather the storms\r\nthat threatened or assailed. The privilege of making war on its own\r\naccount, conceded by Charles II, gave the Company a national importance\r\nwhich was destined to consolidate its interests with those of England\r\nitself. So strong did it become that before the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury it was able to resist the attack on its charter made by a\r\npowerful and progressive rival, the “New Company.” The rivals, after a\r\nfew years of _pourparlers_ and tentative efforts, were united in 1708;\r\nand thenceforth the amalgamation, under the title “The United Company\r\nof Merchants of England trading to the East Indies,” was practically\r\nunassailable on its own account. It was additionally safe in that it\r\nhad the protection of the great Whig Party under Godolphin. The capital\r\nof the Company, now enlarged to £3,200,000, was lent to the Government\r\nat five per cent. interest and was finally merged in the National\r\nFunds. The history of the Company, after 1717 does not belong here, as\r\nit is only considered as showing that John Law had the experience of an\r\nearlier Company similar to his own to guide him in its management if he\r\nhad chosen to avail himself of it.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of England was, strangely enough, the project of a Scotchman,\r\nWilliam Paterson. The plan was submitted to Government in 1691 but\r\nwas not carried into existence for three years. It was purely a\r\nbusiness concern, brought into effective existence through the needs\r\nof commerce, the opportunity afforded being the need of the State\r\nand the concern of the statesman. It had a capital at first of over\r\n£1,200,000, which was loaned to the nation on the security of the taxes\r\nwhen the Charter was signed, there being certain safeguards against\r\nthe possibility of political misuse. The Controlling Board was to have\r\ntwenty-five members who were to be elected annually by the stockholders\r\nwith a substantial qualification. There were at this time in England\r\nprivate banks; but this was an effort to formulate the banking\r\nrights, duties, and powers of capital under the ægis of the State\r\nitself. But even so sound a venture, enormously popular from the very\r\nfirst and with the whole might of the nation behind it, had its own\r\ndifficulties to encounter. Its instantaneous success was an incentive\r\nto other adventurers; and the co-operation with government which it\r\nmade manifest created jealousy with private persons and commercial\r\nconcerns. Within two years its very existence was threatened, first by\r\nthe individual hostility of those in the bullion trade, who already\r\nacted as bankers, and then by a rival concern incorporated under strong\r\npolitical support. This was the National Land Bank whose purpose was\r\nto use the security of real estate as a guarantee for the paper money\r\nwhich it issued for convenient usage. Strong as the Bank of England\r\nwas by its nature, its popularity, and its support, it was in actual\r\ndanger until the rival which had never “caught on”--to use an apposite\r\nAmericanism--actually and almost instantaneously collapsed.\r\n\r\nThe safety thus temporarily obtained was purchased at the cost to the\r\nGovernment of a further loan of two million sterling--with the value to\r\nthe contra of an alliance thus begun with the Whig ministry.\r\n\r\nA further danger came from the mad and maddening South Sea Scheme five\r\nyears later; but from which it was happily saved solely through the\r\ngreater cupidity and daring of the newer company.\r\n\r\nThe Darien Company, which followed hard on the heels of The African\r\nCompany, was formed in 1695, by Paterson; on the base of An Act of the\r\nScottish Parliament for the purpose of making an opening for Scottish\r\ncapital after the manner of the East India Company by which English\r\nenterprise had already so largely benefited. Its career was of such\r\nshort duration and its failure so complete that there was little\r\ndifficulty in understanding the causes of its collapse. It might\r\nserve for a _pendant_ of Lamb’s criticism of the meat that was “ill\r\nfed and ill killed, ill kept and ill cooked.” The Company was started\r\nto utilise, in addition to exploiting new lands, the waste of time,\r\nenergy and capital, between West and East; and yet it was not till the\r\nfirst trading fleet was sailing that its objective was made known to\r\nthe adventurers. Its ideas of trading were those of a burlesque, and\r\nits materials of barter with tropical savages on the criminal side of\r\nthe ludicrous--bibles, heavy woollen stuffs and periwigs! Naturally\r\na couple of years finished its working existence and “The rest is\r\nsilence.” And yet at the inception of the scheme two great nations vied\r\nwith one another for its control.\r\n\r\nThere are those who may say that John Law was not an impostor, but\r\na great financier who made a mistake. Financiers must not make\r\nmistakes--or else they must be classed amongst the impostors; for they\r\ndeal with the goods and prospects of others as well as their own.\r\nLaw was simply a gambler on a great scale. He led a nation, through\r\nits units, to believe that the following of his ideas would lead to\r\nsuccess. Financial schemes without good ideas and practical working to\r\ncarry them out are deceptive and destructive. The Mississippi Scheme\r\nis a case in point. If the original intention had been carried out\r\nin its entirety--which involved vast pioneering and executive action\r\nof present and future generations, and an almost absolute foregoing\r\nof immediate benefits--the result would have been of immense service\r\nto the successors in title of the original ventures. The assessable\r\nvalue of the real estate conveyed under the Mississippi Scheme to-day\r\nequals more than a third of the present gigantic National Debt of\r\nFrance, swollen though the latter is by the Napoleonic wars, the war\r\nwith Austria, the cost and indemnity of the war with Germany, and, in\r\naddition, by the long wars with England and Russia.\r\n\r\nIf human beings had been angels, content with the prospect of gains in\r\nthe distant future, Law’s schemes might have succeeded. As it was, he,\r\nworking for his own purposes with an imperfect humanity, can only be\r\njudged by results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. WITCHCRAFT AND CLAIRVOYANCE\r\n\r\nA. THE PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nFor convenience, the masculine offender is in demonology classed under\r\nthe female designation. According to Michelet and other authorities\r\nthere were ten thousand alleged witches for each alleged wizard! and\r\nanyhow there is little etiquette as to the precedence of ladies in\r\ncriminal matters.\r\n\r\nThe first English Statute dealing directly with witches appears to be\r\nthe thirty-third of Henry VIII (1541) which brought into the list of\r\nfelonies persons “devising or practising conjurations, witchcraftes,\r\nsorcerie or inchantments or the digging up of corpses,” and depriving\r\nsuch of the benefit of clergy. It was however repealed by I Edward VI\r\nCap. 12, and again by I Mary (in its first section.). Queen Elizabeth,\r\nhowever, passed another Act (5 Elizabeth Cap. 16) practically repeating\r\nthat of her father, which had been in abeyance for more than thirty\r\nyears. The Statute of Elizabeth is exceedingly interesting in that it\r\nstates the condition of the law at that time. The opening words leave\r\nno misunderstanding:\r\n\r\n    “Whereas at this day there is no ordinary nor condigne punishment\r\n    provided against the wicked offences of conjurations or\r\n    invocations of evil spirits, or of sorceries, inchantments,\r\n    charmes or witchcraftes, which be practised to the obstruction\r\n    of the persons and goods of the Queene’s subjects, or for other\r\n    lewd purposes. Be it enacted that if any person or persons\r\n    after the first day of June next coming, shall use practice, or\r\n    exercise any invocations, or conjurations, of evill or wicked\r\n    spirits, to or for any intent or purpose, or else if any person\r\n    or persons after the said first day of June shall use, practice\r\n    or exercise any witchcraft, enchantment, charme or sorcerie,\r\n    whereby any person shall happen to be killed or destroied, that\r\n    then as well every such offendour or offendours in invocations,\r\n    or conjurations, as is aforesayde, their aydours and counsellors,\r\n    as also everie such offendour or offendours in that Witchcrafte,\r\n    enchantment, charme or sorcerie whereby the death of any person\r\n    doth ensue, their ayders and counsellors, being of eyther of\r\n    the sayde offences lawfully convicted and attainted, shall\r\n    suffer paines of death, as a felon or felons, and shall lose the\r\n    privilege and benefit of Clergy and sanctuary,” &c.\r\n\r\nIn this act lesser penalties are imposed for using any form of\r\nwitchcraft or sorcery, for inducing to any persons harm, or to “provoke\r\nany person to unlawfull love or to hurt or destroy any person in his\r\nor her bodye, member or goods,” or for the discovery or recovery of\r\ntreasure. From that time down to the first quarter of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, when the law practically died out, witchcraft had its place in\r\nthe category of legal offences. The law was finally repealed by an Act\r\nin the tenth year of George II. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nwere the time of witch-fever, and in that period, especially in its\r\nearlier days when the belief had become epidemic, it was ruthless and\r\ndestructive. It is said that in Genoa five hundred persons were burned\r\nwithin three months in the year 1515, and a thousand in the diocese of\r\nComo in a year. Round numbers in such matters are to be distrusted,\r\nas we find they seldom bear investigation; but there is little doubt\r\nthat in France and Germany vast numbers suffered and perished. Even in\r\nmore prosaic and less emotional England there were many thousands of\r\njudicial murders in this wise. It is asserted that within two centuries\r\nthey totalled thirty thousand.\r\n\r\nIt is startling to find such a weird and impossible credulity actually\r\nrooted in the Statute book of one’s own country, and that there are\r\nrecords of judges charging juries to convict. Sir Matthew Hale, a great\r\nlawyer, a judge of the Common Pleas in 1654, and Lord Chief Justice in\r\n1671, was a firm believer in witchcraft. He was a grave and pious man,\r\nand all his life was an ardent student of theology as well as of law.\r\nAnd yet in 1664 he sentenced women to be burned as witches. In 1716 a\r\nmother and daughter--the latter only nine years of age--were hanged in\r\nHuntingdon. In Scotland the last case of a woman being condemned as a\r\nwitch occurred at Dornoch in 1722.\r\n\r\nIt is no easy task in these days, which are rationalistic, iconoclastic\r\nand enquiring, to understand how the commonalty not only believed\r\nin witchcraft but acted on that belief. Probably the most tolerant\r\nview we can take, is that both reason and enquiry are essential\r\nand rudimentary principles of human nature. Every person of normal\r\nfaculties likes to know and understand the reasons of things;\r\nand inquisitiveness is not posterior to the period of maternal\r\nalimentation. If we seek for a cause we are bound to find one--even\r\nif it be wrong. _Omne ignotum pro magnifico_ has a wide if not always\r\na generous meaning; and when fear is founded on, if not inspired by\r\nignorance, that unthinking ferocity which is one of our birthrights\r\nfrom Adam is apt to carry us further than we ever meant to go. In an\r\nage more clear-seeing than our own and less selfish we shall not think\r\nso poorly of primitive emotions as we are at present apt to. On the\r\ncontrary we shall begin to understand that in times when primitivity\r\nholds sway, we are most in touch with the loftiest things we are\r\ncapable of understanding, and our judgment, being complex, is most\r\nexact. Indeed in this branch of the subject persons used to call to aid\r\na special exercise of our natural forces--the æsthetic. When witchcraft\r\nwas a belief, the common idea was that that noxious power was almost\r\nentirely held by the old and ugly. The young, fresh, and beautiful,\r\nwere seldom accepted as witches save by the novelty-loving few or\r\nthose of sensual nature. This was perhaps fortunate--if the keeping\r\ndown of the population in this wise was necessary; it is easier as\r\nwell as safer to murder the uncomely than those of greater charm. In\r\nany case there was no compunction about obliterating the former class.\r\nThe general feeling was much the same as that in our own time which in\r\nsporting circles calls for the destruction of vermin.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the profession of witchcraft, if occasionally\r\nlucrative, was nevertheless always accompanied with danger and\r\nexecration. This was natural enough since the belief which made\r\nwitchcraft dangerous was based on fear. It is not too much to say that\r\nin every case, professed witchcraft was an expression of fraudulent\r\nintent. Such pity, therefore, as the subject allows of must be confined\r\nto the guiltless victims who, despite blameless life, were tried by\r\npassion, judged by frenzy, and executed by remorseless desperation.\r\nThere could be no such thing as quantitative analysis of guilt with\r\nregard to the practice of witchcraft: any kind of playing with the\r\nsubject was a proof of _some_ kind of wrongful intent, and was to be\r\njudged with Draconian severity. Doubtless it was a very simple way\r\nof dealing with evils, much resembling the medical philosophy of the\r\nChinese. The whole logic of it can be reduced to a sorites. Any change\r\nfrom the normal is the work of the devil--or _a_ devil as the case\r\nmay be. Find out the normal residence of that especial devil--which\r\nis in some human being. Destroy the devil’s dwelling. You get rid of\r\nthe devil. It is pure savagery of the most primitive kind. And it\r\nis capable of expansion, for logic is a fertile plant, and when its\r\npremises are wrong it has the fecundity of a weed. Before even a savage\r\ncan have time to breathe, his logic is piling so fast on him that he\r\nis smothered. If a human being is a devil then the club which destroys\r\nhim or her is an incarnation of good, and so a god to be worshipped in\r\nsome form--or at any rate to be regarded with esteem, like a sword,\r\nor a legal wig, or a stethoscope, or a paint-brush, or a shovel,\r\nor a compass, or a drinking-vessel, or a pen. If all the necessary\r\nconditions of life and sanity and comfort were on so primitive a base,\r\nwhat an easy world it would be to live in!\r\n\r\nOne benefit there was in witchcraft, though it was not recognised\r\nofficially as such at the time. It created a new industry--a whole\r\ncrop of industries. It is of the nature of belief that it encourages\r\nbelief--not always of exactly the same kind--but of some form which\r\nintelligence can turn into profit. We cannot find any good in the new\r\nindustry--grapes do not grow on thorns nor figs on thistles. The sum\r\nof human happiness was in no sense augmented; but at least a good deal\r\nof money or money’s worth changed hands; which, after all, is as much\r\nas most of the great financiers can point to as the result of long and\r\nstrenuous success. In the organisation of this form of crime there were\r\nmany classes, of varying risks and of benefits in inverse ratio to\r\nthem. For the ordinary rule of finance holds even here: large interest\r\nmeans bad security. First there were the adventurers themselves who\r\ntook the great risks of life and its collaterals--esteem, happiness,\r\n&c. The money obtained by this class was usually secured by fraudulent\r\nsales of worthless goods or by the simple old financial device of\r\nblackmail. Then there were those who were in reality merely parasites\r\non the pleasing calling--those timorous souls who let “‘I dare not’\r\nwait upon ‘I would’ like the poor cat i’ the adage.” These were\r\naltogether in a poorer way of trade than their bolder brothers and\r\nsisters. They lacked courage, and sometimes even sufficient malice\r\nfor the proper doing of their work; with the result that success\r\nseldom attended them at all, and never heartily. But at any rate they\r\ncould not complain of inadequate punishment; whenever religious zeal\r\nflamed up they were generally prominent victims. They can in reality\r\nonly be regarded as specimens of parasitic growth. Then there came\r\nthe class known in French criminal circles as _agents provocateurs_,\r\nwhose business was not only to further ostensible crime but to work\r\nup the opposition against it. Either branch of their art would\r\nprobably be inadequate; but by linking their services they managed to\r\neke out a livelihood. Lastly there was the lowest grade of all, the\r\nWitch-finder--a loathly calling, comparable only to the class or guild\r\nof “paraskistae” or “rippers” in the ritual of the Mummy industry of\r\nancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nOf these classes we may I think consider some choice specimens--so\r\nfar as we may fittingly investigate the _personnel_ of a by-gone\r\nindustry. Of the main body, that of Wizards and Witches or those\r\npretending to the cult, let us take Doctor Dee and Madame Voisin, and\r\nSir Edward Kelley and Mother Damnable--thus representing the method of\r\nthe procession of the unclean animals from the Ark. Of the class of\r\nWitchfinders one example will probably be as much as we can stand, and\r\nwe will naturally take the one who obtained fame in his calling--namely\r\nMatthew Hopkins, who stands forth like Satan, “by merit raised to that\r\nbad eminence.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. DOCTOR DEE\r\n\r\n\r\nEven a brief survey of the life of the celebrated “Doctor Dee,” the\r\nso-called “Wizard” of the sixteenth century, will leave any honest\r\nreader under the impression that in the perspective of history he was\r\na much maligned man. If it had not been that now and again he was led\r\ninto crooked bye-paths of alleged occultism, his record might have\r\nstood out as that of one of the most accomplished and sincere of the\r\nscientists of his time. He was in truth, whatever were his faults,\r\nmore sinned against than sinning. If the English language is not so\r\nelastic as some others in the matter of meaning of phrases, the same\r\nor a greater effect can be obtained by a careful use of the various\r\ndialects of the British Empire. In the present case we may, if English\r\nlacks, well call on some of the varieties of Scotch terminology.\r\nThe intellectual status of the prime wizard, as he is held to be in\r\ngeneral opinion, can be well indicated by any of the following words\r\nor phrases “wanting,” “crank,” “a tile off,” “a wee bit saft,” “a bee\r\nin his bonnet.” Each of these is indicative of some form of monomania,\r\ngenerally harmless. If John Dee had not had some great qualities, such\r\nnegative weaknesses would have prevented his reputation ever achieving\r\na permanent place in history of any kind. As it is his place was won by\r\nmany accomplished facts. The following is a broad outline of his life,\r\nwhich was a long one lasting for over eighty years.\r\n\r\nJohn Dee was born in 1527, and came of a Welsh race. A good many years\r\nafter his start in life he, after the harmless fashion of those (and\r\nother) times, made out a family tree in which it was shewn that he was\r\ndescended from, among other royalties, Roderick the Great, Prince of\r\nWales. This little effort of vanity did not, however, change anything.\r\nThe world cared then about such things almost as little as it does\r\nnow; or, allowing for the weakness of human beings in the way of their\r\nown self-importance, it might be better to say as it professes to do\r\nnow. John Dee was sent to the University of Cambridge when he was only\r\nfifteen years old. The College chosen for him was St. John’s, and here\r\nhe showed extraordinary application in his chosen subject, mathematics.\r\nHe took his probationary degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1545, and was\r\nmade a Fellow in 1546. In his early years of College life his work was\r\nregulated in a remarkable way. Out of the twenty-four hours, eighteen\r\nwere devoted to study, four to sleep, the remaining two being set\r\napart for meals and recreation. Lest this should seem incredible it\r\nmay be remembered that three hundred years later, the French Jesuits,\r\nhaving made exhaustive experiments, arrived at the conclusion that for\r\nmere purposes of health, without making any allowance for the joy or\r\nhappiness of life, and treating the body merely as a machine from which\r\nthe utmost amount of work mental and physical could be got without\r\ninjury, four hours of sleep per diem sufficed for health and sanity.\r\nAnd it is only natural that a healthy and ambitious young man trying to\r\nwork his way to success would, or might have been, equally strenuous\r\nand self-denying. His appointment as Fellow of St. John’s was one of\r\nthose made when the College was founded. That he was skilled in other\r\nbranches of learning was shown by the fact that in the University he\r\nwas appointed as Under Reader in Greek. He was daring in the practical\r\napplication of science, and during the representation of one of the\r\ncomedies of Aristophanes, created such a sensation by appearing to fly,\r\nthat he began to be credited by his companions with magical powers.\r\nThis was probably the beginning of the sinister reputation which seemed\r\nto follow him all his life afterwards. When once an idea of the kind\r\nhas been started even the simplest facts of life and work seem to\r\ngather round it and enlarge it indefinitely. So far as we can judge\r\nafter a lapse of over three hundred years, John Dee was an eager and\r\nardent seeker after knowledge; and all through his life he travelled\r\nin the search wherever he was likely to gain his object. It is a main\r\ndifficulty of following such a record that we have only facts to\r\nfollow. We know little or nothing of motives except from results, and\r\nas in the development of knowledge the measure of success can only\r\nbear a small ratio to that of endeavour, it is manifest that we should\r\nshow a large and tolerant understanding of the motives which animate\r\nthe seeker for truth. In the course of his long life John Dee visited\r\nmany lands, sojourned in many centres of learning, had relations of\r\ncommon interests as well as of friendship with many great scholars,\r\nand made as thinker, mathematician, and astronomer, a reputation far\r\ntranscending any ephemeral and purely gaseous publicity arising from\r\nthe open-mouthed wonder of the silly folk who are not capable of even\r\ntrying to understand things beyond their immediate ken. Wherever he\r\nwent he seems to have been in touch with the learned and progressive\r\nmen of his time, and always a student. At various times he was in\r\nthe Low Countries, Louvain (from whose University he obtained the\r\ndegree of LL.D.), Paris, Wurtemberg, Antwerp, Presburg, Lorraine,\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Oder, Bohemia, Cracow, Prague, and Hesse-Cassel. He\r\neven went so far afield as St. Helena. He was engaged on some great\r\nworks of more than national importance. For instance, when in 1582,\r\nPope Gregory XIII instituted the reform of the Calendar which was\r\nadopted by most of the great nations of the world, Dee approved and\r\nworked out his own calculations to an almost similar conclusion,\r\nthough the then opposition to him cost England a delay of over one\r\nhundred and seventy years. In 1572 he had proved his excellence as an\r\nastronomer in his valuable work in relation to a newly discovered star\r\n(Tycho Brahe’s) in Cassiopœia. In 1580 he made a complete geographical\r\nand hydrographical map of the Queen’s possessions. He tried--but\r\nunhappily in vain--to get Queen Mary to gather the vast collections\r\nof manuscripts and old books which had been made in the Monasteries\r\n(broken up by Henry VIII) of which the major part were then to be\r\nobtained both easily and cheaply. He was a Doctor of Laws (which\r\nby the way was his only claim to be called “Doctor” Dee, the title\r\ngenerally accorded to him). He was made a rector in Worcestershire in\r\n1553; and in 1556, Archbishop Parker gave him ten years’ use of the\r\nlivings of Upton and Long Leadenham. He was made Warden of Manchester\r\nCollege in 1595, and was named by Queen Elizabeth as Chancellor of St.\r\nPaul’s. In 1564, he was appointed Dean of Gloucester, though through\r\nhis own neglect of his own interest it was never carried out. The\r\nQueen approved, the Archbishop sealed the deed; but Dee, unmindful,\r\noverlooked the formality of acceptance and the gift eventually went\r\nelsewhere. Queen Elizabeth, who consistently believed in and admired\r\nhim, wanted to make him a bishop, but he declined the responsibility.\r\nFor once the formality at consecration: “_Nolo Episcopari_” was spoken\r\nwith truthful lips. More than once he was despatched to foreign places\r\nto make special report in the Queen’s service. That he did not--always,\r\nat all events--put private interest before public duty is shown by his\r\nrefusal to accept two rectories offered to him by the Queen in 1576,\r\nurging as an excuse that he was unable to find time for the necessary\r\nduties, since he was too busily occupied in making calculations for\r\nthe reformation of the Calendar. He seems to have lived a most proper\r\nlife, and was twice married. After a long struggle with adversity in\r\nwhich--last despair of a scholar--he had to sell his books, he died\r\nvery poor, just as he was preparing to migrate. At his death in 1608\r\nhe left behind him no less than seventy-nine works--nearly one for\r\neach year of his life. Just after the time of the Armada, following on\r\nsome correspondence with Queen Elizabeth, he had returned to England\r\nafter long and adventurous experiences in Poland and elsewhere, during\r\nwhich he had known what it was to receive the honours and affronts of\r\ncommunities. He took back with him the reputation of being a sorcerer,\r\none which he had never courted and which so rankled in him that many\r\nyears afterwards he petitioned James I to have him tried so that he\r\nmight clear his character.\r\n\r\nIf there be any truth whatever in the theory that men have attendant\r\nspirits, bad as well as good, Dr. Dee’s bad spirit took the shape of\r\none who pretended to occult knowledge, the so-called Sir Edward Kelley\r\nof whom we shall have something to say later on.\r\n\r\nDee was fifty-four years of age when he met Sir Edward Kelley who was\r\ntwenty-eight years his junior. The two men became friends, and then\r\nthe old visionary scholar at once became dominated by his younger and\r\nless scrupulous companion, who very soon became his partner. From that\r\ntime Dee’s down-fall--or rather down-_slide_ began. All the longings\r\nafter occult belief which he had hitherto tried to hold in check began\r\nnot only to manifest themselves, but to find expression. His science\r\nbecame merged in alchemy, his astronomical learning was forced into\r\nthe service of Astrology. His belief, which he as a cleric held before\r\nhim as a duty, was lost in spiritualism and other forms of occultism.\r\nHe began to make use for practical purposes of his crystal globe and\r\nhis magic mirror in which he probably had for long believed secretly.\r\nKelley practically ruined his reputation by using for his own purposes\r\nthe influence which he had over the old man. His opportunities were\r\nincreased by the arrival in England of Laski, about 1583. The two\r\nscholars had many ideas in common, and Kelley did not fail, in the\r\nfurtherance of his own views, to take advantage of the circumstance.\r\nHe persuaded Dee to go with his new friend to Poland, in the hope of\r\nbenefiting further in his studies in the occult by wider experience\r\nof foreign centres of learning. They journeyed to Laskoe near Cracow,\r\nwhere the weakness of the English scholar became more evident and his\r\nform of madness more developed. Dee had now a fixed belief in two\r\nideas which he had hitherto failed to materialise--the Philosopher’s\r\nStone and the Elixir of Life, both of them dreams held as possible of\r\nrealisation to the scientific dreamer in the period of the Renaissance.\r\nDee believed at one time that he had got hold of the Philosopher’s\r\nStone, and actually sent to Queen Elizabeth a piece of gold taken from\r\na transmuted warming-pan. As it is said in the life of Dee that he\r\nand Kelley had found a quantity of the Elixir of Life in the ruins of\r\nGlastonbury Abbey, we can easily imagine what part the latter had in\r\nthe transaction. It was he, too, who probably fixed on Glastonbury as\r\nthe place in which to search for Elixirs, as that holy spot had already\r\na reputation of its own in such matters. It has been held for ages that\r\nthe staff used by Joseph of Arimathea took root and blossomed there.\r\nSomehow, whatever the Glastonbury Elixir did, the Philosopher’s Stone\r\ndid not seem to keep its alleged properties in the Dee family. John\r\nDee’s young son Arthur, aged eight, tried its efficacy; but without\r\nsuccess. Perhaps it was this failure which made Kelley more exacting,\r\nfor a couple of years later in 1589, he told his partner that angels\r\nhad told him it was the divine wish that they should have their wives\r\nin common. The sage, who was fond of his wife--who was a comely woman,\r\nwhereas Kelley’s was ill favoured and devoid of charms--naturally\r\ndemurred at such an utterance even of occult spirits. Mrs. Dee also\r\nobjected, with the result that there were alarums and excursions and\r\nthe partnership was rudely dissolved--which is a proof that though the\r\naged philosopher’s mind had been vitiated by the evil promptings of his\r\nwily companion he had not quite declined to idiocy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. LA VOISIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Paris a woman named Des Hayes Voisin, a widow who had taken up the\r\nbusiness of a midwife, towards the end of the seventeenth century\r\nmade herself notorious by the telling of fortunes. Such at least\r\nwas the manifest occupation of the worthy lady, and as she did not\r\nflaunt herself unduly, her existence was rather a retired one. Few who\r\ndid not seek her services knew of her existence, fewer still of her\r\nresidence. The life of a professor of such mysteries as the doings of\r\nFate--so-called--is prolonged and sweetened by seclusion. But there\r\nis always an “underground” way of obtaining information for such as\r\nreally desire it; and Madame Voisin, for all her evasive retirement,\r\nwas always to be found when wanted--which means when she herself wanted\r\nto be found. She was certainly a marvellous prophet, within a certain\r\nrange of that occult art. Like all clever people she fixed limitations\r\nfor herself; which was wise of her, for to prophesy on behalf of every\r\none who may yearn for a raising of the curtain, be it of never so small\r\na corner, on all possible subjects, is to usurp the general functions\r\nof the Almighty. Wisely therefore, Madame Voisin became a specialist.\r\nHer subject was husbands; her chief theme their longevity. Naturally\r\nsuch women as were unsatisfied with the personality, circumstances,\r\nor fortunes of their partners, joined the mass of her _clientèle_, a\r\nmass which taking it “bye and large” maintained a strange exactness\r\nof dimensions. This did not much trouble the public, or even the body\r\nof her clients, for no one except Madame herself knew their numbers.\r\nIt was certainly a strange thing how accurately Madame guessed, for\r\nshe had seemingly no data to go on--the longevity of the husbands were\r\nnever taken into the confidence of the prophet. She took care to keep\r\nalmost to herself the rare good fortune, in a sense, which attended her\r\ndivination; for ever since the misfortune which had attended the late\r\nMarquise de Brinvilliers became public, the powers of the law had taken\r\na quite unnecessary interest in the proceedings of all of her cult.\r\nLongevity is quite a one-sided arrangement of nature; we can only be\r\nsure of its accuracy when it is too late to help in its accomplishment.\r\nIn such a game there is only one throw of the dice, so that it behoves\r\nanyone who would wager successfully to be very sure that the chances\r\nare in his--or her--favour.\r\n\r\nMadame Voisin’s clients were generally in a hurry, and so were willing\r\nto take any little trouble or responsibility necessary to ensure\r\nsuccess. They had two qualities which endear customers to those of La\r\nVoisin’s trade; they were grateful and they were silent. That they\r\nwere of cheery and hopeful spirit was shown by the fact that as a rule\r\nthey married again soon after the dark cloud of bereavement had fallen\r\non them. When the funeral baked meats have coldly furnished forth the\r\nmarriage tables, it is better to remain as inconspicuous as possible;\r\nfriends and onlookers will take notice, and, when they notice, they\r\nwill talk. Moreover the new partner is often suspicious and apt to be a\r\nlittle jealous of his predecessor in title. Thus, Madame Voisin being\r\nclever and discreet, and her clients being--or at any rate appearing\r\nto be--happy in their new relations and silent to the world at large,\r\nall went prosperously with the kindly-hearted prophet. No trouble rose\r\nas to testamentary dispositions. Men who are the subjects of prophecy\r\nhave usually excellently-drawn wills. This is especially the case with\r\nhusbands who are no longer young. Young husbands are as a rule not made\r\nthe subjects of prophecy.\r\n\r\nMadame Voisin’s great accuracy of prediction did not excite at the\r\ntime so much public admiration as it might have done if she or her\r\nclients had taken the public more into their confidence; but it was\r\nnoted afterwards that in most cases the male individual who retired\r\nearly from the scene was the senior partner in that _congeries_ of\r\nthree which has come to be known as “the eternal triangle.” In later\r\nconversations, following in the wake of the completed prophecy,\r\nconfidences were exchanged as to the studies in certain matters\r\nof science in which Madame Voisin seemed to have attained a rare\r\nproficiency.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Charles Peace, an adventurous if acquisitive spirit, who\r\ngave up his life in the same manner as the deceased Mr. Haman, worked\r\nalone during the long period of his professional existence, and with\r\nmisleading safety. The illustrious French lady-prophet unwisely did\r\nnot value this form of security, and so multiplied opportunities of\r\nfailure. She followed an entirely opposite policy, one which though it\r\ndoubtless stood by her on many occasions had a fatal weakness. In some\r\nways it may facilitate matters if one is one’s own Providence; such\r\na course avoids temporarily errors of miscalculation or deduction of\r\nprobable results. And just as the roulette table has certain chances\r\nin favour of Zero, there is for the practical prophet a large hazard\r\nin that the dead are unable to speak or to renew effort on a more\r\nfavourable basis. La Voisin, probably through some unfavourable or\r\nthreatening experiences, saw the wisdom of associating the forces of\r\nprediction and accomplishment, and with the readiness of an active\r\npersonality effected the junction. For this she was already fairly\r\nwell equipped with experiences. Both as a wife and a lover of warm\r\nand voluptuous nature she understood something of the passions of\r\nhumanity, on both the female and the male side; and being a woman she\r\nknew perhaps better of the two the potency of feminine longing. This\r\ndid not act so strongly in the lesser and more directly commercial,\r\nif less uncertain, phases of her art, such as finding lost property,\r\ndivining the result of hazards, effecting immunity from danger, or the\r\npreserving indefinitely the more pleasing qualities of youth. But in\r\nsterner matters, when the issue was of life or death, the masculine\r\ntendency towards recklessness kicked the beam. As a nurse in active\r\ntouch with both medical and surgical wants, aims, and achievements,\r\nshe was at ease in the larger risks of daily life. And after all, her\r\nown ambitions, aided by the compelling of her own natural demands\r\nfor physical luxury, were quite independent, only seeking through\r\nexiguous means a way of achievement. In secret she studied the mystery\r\nof a toxicologist; and, probably by cautious experiment, satisfied\r\nherself of her proficiency in that little-known science. That she had\r\nother aims, more or less dependent on this or the feelings which its\r\nknowledge superinduced, can be satisfactorily guessed from some of her\r\nattendant labours which declared themselves later.\r\n\r\nAfter a time La Voisin’s vogue as a sorceress brought her into\r\ncertain high society where freedom of action was unhampered by moral\r\nrestraints. The very rich, the leaders of society and fashion of the\r\ntime, the unscrupulous whose ambitious efforts had been crowned with\r\nsuccess of a kind, leaders of Court life, those in high military\r\ncommand, mistresses of royalty and high aristocracy--all became\r\ncompanions and clients in one or more of her mysterious arts. Amongst\r\nthem were the Duchesse de Bouillon, the Comtesse de Soissons, Madame\r\nde Montespan, Olympe de Mancini, Marshal de Luxembourg, the Duc de\r\nVendôme, Prince de Clermont-Lodeve. It was not altogether fashionable\r\nnot to be in touch with Madame Voisin. Undeterred by the lessons of\r\nhistory, La Voisin went on her way, forced as is usual in such cases by\r\nthe circumstances which grow around the criminal and prove infinitely\r\nthe stronger. She was at the height of her success when the public\r\nsuspicion, followed by action, revealed the terrible crimes of the\r\nMarquise de Brinvilliers; and she was caught in the tail of the tempest\r\nthus created.\r\n\r\nThis case of Madame de Brinvilliers is a typical one of how a human\r\nbeing, goaded by passion and lured by opportunity, may fall swiftly\r\nfrom any estate. It is so closely in touch with that of Madame Voisin\r\nthat the two have almost to be considered together. They began with the\r\ndesire for dabbling in forbidden mysteries. Three men--two Italians\r\nand one German, all men of some ability--were violent searchers for\r\nthe mythical “philosopher’s stone” which was to fulfil the dream of\r\nthe mediæval alchemist by turning at will all things into gold. In the\r\nsearch they all gravitated to Paris. There the usual thing happened.\r\nMoney ran short and foolish hoping had to be supplemented by crime.\r\nIn the whirling world of the time there was always a ready sale for\r\nmeans to an end, however nefarious either might be. The easy morality\r\nof the time allowed opportunity for all means, with the result that\r\nthere was an almost open dealing in poisons. The soubriquet which stole\r\ninto existence--it dared not proclaim itself--is a self-explanatory\r\nhistorical lesson. The _poudre de succession_ marks an epoch which,\r\nfor sheer, regardless, remorseless, profligate wickedness is almost\r\nwithout peer in history, and this is said without forgetting the time\r\nof the Borgias. Not even natural affection or family life or individual\r\nrelationship or friendliness was afforded any consideration. This phase\r\nof crime, which was one almost confined to the upper and wealthier\r\nclasses, depended on wealth and laws of heredity and entail. Those who\r\nbenefited by it salved what remnants of conscience still remained to\r\nthem with the thought that they were but helping the natural process of\r\nwaste and recuperation. The old and feeble were removed, with as little\r\ncoil as might be necessary, in order that the young and lusty might\r\nbenefit. As the change was a form of plunder, which had to be paid\r\nfor in a degree in some way approximate to results, prices ran high.\r\nPoisoning on a successful scale requires skilful and daring agents,\r\nwhose after secrecy as well as whose present aid has to be secured.\r\nExili and Glasser--one of the Italians and the German--did a thriving\r\ntrade. As usual in such illicit traffic, the possibility of purchase\r\nunder effective conditions made a market. There is every reason to\r\nbelieve from after results that La Voisin was one such agent. The cause\r\nof La Brinvilliers entering the market was the purely personal one of\r\nan affair of sensual passion. Death is an informative circumstance.\r\nSuspicion began to leak out that the polyglot firm of needy foreigners\r\nhad dark dealings. Two of them--the Italians--were arrested and sent to\r\nthe Bastille where one of them died. By unhappy chance the other was\r\ngiven as cell-companion Captain Sainte-Croix, who was a lover of the\r\nMarquise de Brinvilliers. Sainte-Croix as a Captain in the regiment\r\nof the Marquis had become intimate in his house. Brinvilliers was a\r\nfatuous person and of imperfect moral vision. The Captain was handsome,\r\nand Madame la Marquise amorous. Behold then all the usual _personnel_\r\nof a tragedy of three. After a while the intrigue became a matter of\r\nfamily concern. The lady’s father,--the Civil Lieutenant d’Aulroy,\r\nprocured a _lettre de cachet_, and had the erring lover immured in the\r\nBastille as the easiest and least public way out of the difficulty.\r\n“Evil communications corrupt good manners,” says the proverb. The\r\nproverbial philosopher understated the danger of such juxtaposition.\r\nEvil manners added corruption even to their kind. In the Bastille the\r\nexasperated lover listened to the wiles of Exili; and another stage\r\nof misdoing began. The Marquise determined on revenge, and be sure\r\nthat in such a case in such a period even the massive walls of the\r\nBastille could not prevent the secret whisper of a means of effecting\r\nit. D’Aulroy, his two sons, and another sister perished. Brinvilliers\r\nhimself was spared through some bizarre freak of his wife’s conscience.\r\nThen the secret began to be whispered--first, it was said, through\r\nthe confessional; and the _Chambre Ardente_, analogous to the British\r\nStar Chamber, instituted for such purposes, took the case in hand. The\r\nresult might have been doubtful, for great social forces were at work\r\nto hush up such a scandal, but that, with a truly seventeenth century\r\ncandour, the prisoner had written an elaborate confession of her guilt,\r\nwhich if it did not directly assure condemnation at least put justice\r\non the right track.\r\n\r\nThe trial was a celebrated one, and involved incidentally many\r\nillustrious persons as well as others of lesser note. In the end, in\r\n1676, Madame la Marquise de Brinvilliers was burned--that is, what was\r\nleft of her was burned after her head had been cut off, a matter of\r\ngrace in consideration of her rank. It is soothing to the feelings of\r\nmany relatives and friends--not to mention those of the principal--in\r\nsuch a case when “great command o’ersways the order” of purgation by\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nBefore the eddy of the Brinvilliers’ criminal scandal reached to the\r\nlower level of Madame Voisin, a good many scandals were aired; though\r\nagain “great command” seems to have been operative, so far as human\r\npower availed, in minimising both scandals and punishments. Amongst\r\nthose cited to the _Chambre Ardente_ were two nieces of Cardinal\r\nMazarin, the Duchesse de Bouillon, the Comtesse de Soissons, and\r\nMarshal de Luxembourg. In some of these cases that which in theatrical\r\nparlance is called “comic relief” was not wanting. It was a witty if\r\nimpertinent answer of the Duchesse de Bouillon to one of her judges,\r\nLa Reyne, an ill-favoured man, who asked, apropos of a statement made\r\nat the trial that she had taken part in an alleged invocation of\r\nBeelzebub, “and did you ever see the Devil?”--\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am looking at him now. He is ugly, and is disguised as a\r\nCouncillor of State!”\r\n\r\nThe King, Louis XIV, took much interest in the trial and even tried\r\nnow and again to smooth matters. He even went so far as to advise\r\nthe Comtesse de Soissons who was treated by the Court rather as a\r\nfoolish than a guilty woman, to keep out of the way if she were really\r\nguilty. In answer she said with the haughtiness of her time that\r\nthough she was innocent she did not care to appear in a Law Court. She\r\nwithdrew to Brussels where she died some twenty years later. Marshal\r\nde Luxembourg--François Henri de Montmorenci-Boutteville, duke, peer,\r\nMarshal of France to give his full titles--was shown to have engaged in\r\nan attempt to recover lost property by occult means. On which basis\r\nand for having once asked Madame Voisin to produce his Satanic Majesty,\r\nhe was alleged to have sold himself to the Devil. But his occult\r\nadventures did not stand in the way of his promotion as a soldier\r\nthough he had to stand a trial of over a year long; he was made Captain\r\nof the Guard and finally given command of the Army.\r\n\r\nLa Voisin with her accomplices--a woman named Vigoureux and Le Sage,\r\na priest--were with a couple of score of others arrested in 1679, and\r\nwere, after a spell of imprisonment in the Bastille, tried. As a result\r\nVoisin, Vigoureux and her brother, and Le Sage were burned early in\r\n1680. In Voisin’s case the mercy of previous decapitation, which had\r\nbeen accorded to her guilty sister Brinvilliers, was not extended to\r\nher. Perhaps this was partly because of the attitude which she had\r\ntaken up with regard to religious matters. Amongst other unforgivable\r\nacts she had repelled the Crucifix--a terrible thing to do according to\r\nthe ideas of that superstitious age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. SIR EDWARD KELLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nCarlyle in his _French Revolution_ makes a contrast between two works\r\nof imagination which mark the extremes of the forces that made for\r\nthe disruption of France, _Paul et Virginie_ and _Le Chevalier de\r\nFaublas_. The former he calls “the swan-song of old dying France”; of\r\nthe latter he says “if this wretched _Faublas_ is a death-speech, it\r\nis one under the gallows, and by a felon that does not repent.” This\r\ndouble analogy may well serve for a comparison of Dr. Dee and the man\r\nwho was at once his partner for a time, and his evil genius. The grave\r\nearnest old scholar, with instincts for good, high endeavour, and a\r\nvast intellectual strength, contrasts well with the mean-souled shifty\r\nspecious rogue who fastened himself on him and leech-like drained him\r\n“dry as hay.”\r\n\r\nSuch historians as mention the existence of the latter are even a\r\nlittle doubtful how to spell his name. This, however, does not matter\r\nmuch--nay, at all, for it is probably not that to which he was born.\r\nBriefly the following is his record as far as can be discovered. He\r\nwas born in 1555 to parents living in Worcester, who having tried\r\nto bring him up as an apothecary, sent him to Oxford when he was\r\nseventeen years of age. There he was entered at Gloucester Hall,\r\nunder the name of Talbot. As however three men of that name were in\r\nthe Hall at the same time, it is doubtful what family can claim the\r\nhonour of his kinship. His college life was short--only lasting a\r\nyear--and inconspicuous. “He left,” we are told, “abruptly.” Then, as\r\nif to complete the purely educational phase of his existence, he was\r\nfor a while an attorney, eking out the tenuity of his legal practice\r\nby aid of forgery. Thus full-fledged for his work in life, he made\r\nhis first properly-recorded appearance in the pillory in 1580, for\r\nan offence which is variously spoken of as forgery and coining. At\r\nany rate his ears were cropped off, a loss which necessitated for\r\nprudential reasons his wearing a skullcap for the remainder of his\r\ndays. This he wore with such conspicuous success that it is said that\r\neven Doctor Dee, who was his partner for nearly seven years, did not\r\nknow of his mutilation. Kelley’s next recorded offence was one which\r\nin a later age when subjects for dissection (necessary for purposes of\r\neducation in anatomy) were difficult to obtain, was popularly known\r\nas “body-snatching.” The commission of this offence though a serious\r\nbreach of the law, came to be regarded as a necessary condition of\r\nstudy; and even if punishment was meted out, it was not looked upon as\r\ndishonour. But in Kelley’s case the offence was committed not for the\r\npurpose of scientific education but for one of sorcery. It took place\r\nin Walton-le-dale in Lancashire, where Kelley dug up a body buried\r\non the previous day, for purposes of necromancy, which, it will be\r\nremembered, was, as the etymology of the word implies, divination by\r\nmeans of the dead.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, he seemed to see his way clear to the final choice\r\nof a profession. He had tasted crime and punishment, and considered\r\nhimself well qualified to accept the risks as well as the benefits;\r\nand so chose fraud as his life work. He was still under twenty-five\r\nyears of age when he began to look about him for his next means\r\nor occasion of turning his special talents to profit. After some\r\ndeliberation he fixed on the existence and qualities of the famous (as\r\nhe had then become) Doctor Dee, and carefully commenced operations.\r\nHe called on the mathematician at his house at Mortlake and made his\r\nacquaintance. Dee was naturally impressed by the conversation and\r\nostensible qualities of the young man, who had the plausibility of the\r\nborn rogue and laid himself out to captivate the old man, more than\r\ndouble his companion’s age and worn by arduous study. He fostered all\r\nDee’s natural weaknesses, humoured his fads, was enthusiastic regarding\r\nhis beliefs which he appeared to share, and urged on his personal\r\nambitions. The belief in occultism which the philosopher cherished\r\nin secret, though he had openly and formally repudiated it a dozen\r\nyears before in his preface to Sir Henry Billingsley’s translation\r\nof Euclid, gave the parasitic rogue his cue for further ingratiating\r\nhimself, and before long he entered Dee’s service at an annual salary\r\nof fifty pounds. His special function was that of “skryer,” which\r\nwas his own or Dee’s reading of “seer.” His contribution to the\r\ngeneral result was to see the figures which did--or did not--appear\r\nin the so-called “magic” crystal, an office for which his useful\r\nimagination, his unblushing assurance, and his utter unscrupulousness\r\neminently fitted him. In fact he was in his designs of fraud a perfect\r\ncomplement of the simple-minded scientist. Of course as days went on\r\nand opportunities offered themselves, through Dee’s growing madness\r\nand Kelley’s social enlargements, the horizon of chicanery widened.\r\nThis was largely assisted by the opportune arrival in England of the\r\nPalatine Albert Laski in 1583. Laski was just the man that Kelley was\r\nwaiting for. A rich man with a taste for occult science; sufficiently\r\nlearned to keep in touch with the theories of occultism of that time;\r\nsufficiently vain to be used by an unscrupulous adventurer who tickled\r\nhis intellectual palate whilst he matured his frauds upon him.\r\n\r\nKelley having worked on Dee’s feelings sufficiently to secure his\r\nacquiescence, procured that Laski should be allowed to aid in such\r\noperations and experiments as appealed to him. The result was that the\r\nPalatine took the two men with him, promising a free field for them\r\nboth, each according to his bent. At Prague, in 1583, Laski presented\r\nDee and his companion to the Emperor Rudolph II. Encouraged by the\r\nroyal approval, Dee looked for a longer sojourn in eastern Europe, and\r\nbrought thither his wife and children from Poland, where he had left\r\nthem at Laskoe, the seat of the Palatine. Later on, in 1585,--again\r\nthrough the influence of the credulous Laski--Dee with his companion\r\nwas presented to Stephen, King of Poland. Stephen was much interested,\r\nand attended a _séance_ that he might see the spirits of which he\r\nhad heard so much. He saw too much, however, as far as Kelley was\r\nconcerned, for he penetrated the imposture. Thereupon Kelley, unequal\r\nto carrying on the business single-handed, for he dared not let Dee’s\r\neyes be opened and he knew he could not induce him to be other than\r\na blind partner, contrived that a new confederate should be added to\r\nthe firm. This was one Francis Pucci, a Florentine, possessed of all\r\nthe address and subtlety of his race. But after the experience of a\r\nyear he was removed on suspicion of bad faith. Before that year was\r\nout, the Bishop of Piacenza, Apostolic Nuncio at the Emperor’s Court,\r\nhad a decree issued that the two Englishmen should quit Prague within\r\nsix days. From Prague they went to Erfurt, in Thuringia; but despite\r\nletters of recommendation from high quarters the Municipal Authorities\r\nwould not allow them to remain. So they moved on to Hesse-Cassel and\r\nthence to Tribau in Bohemia, where the fraud of making spirits appear\r\nwas renewed. In 1586, it was intimated to Dee that the Emperor of\r\nRussia wished to receive him in that country. He would receive a fee of\r\ntwo thousand pounds per annum and would be treated with honour; but the\r\nscholar did not see his way to accept the flattering offer. At Tribau,\r\nKelley experimented, but unsuccessfully, with some powder found at\r\nGlastonbury, Dee’s young son being the medium. It was noticeable that\r\nwhenever Dee or his family failed in these experiments, Kelley always\r\nsucceeded. At this stage Kelley, who was a man of evil life, fell madly\r\nin love with Dee’s wife. He was married himself, but that did not seem\r\nto matter. His own wife was ugly and unattractive, whereas the second\r\nMrs. Dee was well-favoured and winning. In the madness of his lust\r\nhe tried to work on the husband’s credulity by telling him that it\r\nhad been conveyed to him through angels that it was the Divine wish\r\nthat the two men should hold their wives in common. Dee was naturally\r\nsceptical and annoyed, and his wife was furious. Kelley, however, was\r\npersistent, and stuck to his point so stedfastly that after a while\r\nthe woman’s resolution began to give way, and for a time some sort of\r\nworking arrangement came about. Kelley’s story, as elaborated to his\r\npartner, was that at Tribau, in 1587, the crystal showed him a vision\r\nof a naked woman who conveyed to him the divine message. To Dee’s\r\nunhinged mind this seemed all natural and correct--probably even to\r\nthe suitable costume adopted by the angelic messenger: so the worthy\r\ndoctor gave way. After a time however the matron recovered her sanity,\r\nand the vulture and the pigeon parted. Dee gave up to his late partner\r\nall the “tools of trade” and “properties” of the fraud, and the two\r\nnever met again.\r\n\r\nKelley went to Prague where he was thrown into prison in 1589. He\r\nremained in durance for four years after which he was released. From\r\nthence on till 1595, he became a vagabond as well as a rogue, and\r\nwandered about Germany. He again fell into the hands of Rudolph, to be\r\nagain imprisoned by him. He was killed whilst making a desperate effort\r\nto escape.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no record of Edward Kelley--or Talbot--having been\r\nknighted, no authority save his own wish for the use of the title. It\r\nmay of course be possible that he was knighted by the Emperor in some\r\nmoment of absurd credulity; but there is no record of it. He had no\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE. MOTHER DAMNABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to a want of accord among historians, the searcher after historic\r\ntruth in our own day can hardly be quite sure of the identity of the\r\nworthy lady who passed under the above enchanting title. To later\r\ngenerations the district of Camden Town--formerly a suburb of London\r\nbut now a fairly central part of it--is best known through a public\r\nhouse, the _Mother Red-Cap_. But before controversy can cease we are\r\ncalled on to decide if Mother Red-Cap and Mother Damnable were one\r\nand the same person. A hundred years ago a writer who had made such\r\nsubjects his own, came to the conclusion that the soubriquet Mother\r\nDamnable was synonymous with Mother Black-Cap whom he spoke of as of\r\nlocal fame. But in the century that has elapsed historical research has\r\nbeen more scientifically organised and the field from which conclusions\r\ncan be drawn has been enlarged as well as explored. The fact is that\r\na century ago the northern suburb had two well-known public houses,\r\n_Mother Red-Cap_ and _Mother Black-Cap_. It is possible that both the\r\nworthy vintners who offered “entertainment for man and beast” meant one\r\nand the same person, though who that person was remains to be seen.\r\nThe distinctive colour line of the two hostelries was also possibly\r\ndue to considerations of business rather than of art. _Red-cap_ and\r\n_Black-cap_ are, as names, drawn from these varying sign-boards; the\r\nterm _Mother_ held in common is simply a title given without any\r\npretence of doing honour to the alleged practices of the person whom it\r\nis intended to designate.\r\n\r\nThere were in fact two notorious witches, either of whom might have\r\nbeen in the mind of either artistic designer. One was of Yorkshire\r\nfame in the time of Henry VII. The other was of very much later date\r\nand of purely local notoriety. The two publicans who exploited these\r\nidentities under pictorial garb were open and avowed trade rivals.\r\nThe earlier established of the two had evidently commissioned a\r\npainter to create a striking sign-board on a given subject, and the\r\nartist had fulfilled his task by an alleged portrait of sufficiently\r\nfearsome import to fix the attention of the passer-by, at the same time\r\nconveying to him some hint of the calling of the archetype on which\r\nher fame was based. Prosperity in the venture begot rivalry; and the\r\nowner of the new house of refreshment, wishing to outshine his rival\r\nin trade whilst at the same time availing himself of the publicity and\r\nlocal fame already achieved, commissioned another artist to commit\r\nanother pictorial atrocity under the name of art. So far as the purpose\r\nof publicity went, the ideas were similar; the only differences\r\nbeing in the colour scheme and the measure of attractiveness of the\r\nalleged prototype. From the indications thus given one may form some\r\nopinion--based solely on probability--as to which was the earlier and\r\nwhich the later artistic creation, for it is by this means--and this\r\nmeans only--that we may after the lapse of at least a century bring\r\ntradition to our aid, and guess at the original of Mother Damnable.\r\n\r\nOf the two signs it seems probable that the black one is the older.\r\nAfter all, the main purpose of a sign-board is to catch the eye,\r\nand unless Titian and all who followed him are wrong, red has an\r\nattractive value beyond all other hues. The dictum of the great Italian\r\nis unassailable: “Red catches the eye; yellow holds it; blue gives\r\ndistance.” A free-souled artist with the choice of the whole palette\r\nopen to him might choose black since historical accuracy was a matter\r\nto be valued; but in a question of competition a painter would wisely\r\nchoose red--especially when his rival had confined himself to black.\r\nSo far as attractiveness is concerned, it must be borne in mind that\r\nthe object of the painter and his patron was to bring customers to a\r\nLondon suburban public house in the days of George III. To-day there is\r\na cult of horrors in Paris which has produced some choice specimens of\r\ndecorative art, such for instance as the café known as _Le Rat Mort_.\r\n\r\nSuch places lure their customers by curiosity and sheer horror; but the\r\npersons lured are from a class dominated by “Gallic effervescence” and\r\nattracted by anything that is _bizarre_, and not of the class of the\r\nstolid beer-drinking Briton. But even the most stolid of men is pleased\r\nby the beauty of a woman; so the sign-painter--who knows his art well,\r\nand has evolved from the ranks of his calling such a man as Franz\r\nHals--we may be sure, when he wished to please, took for his model some\r\ngracious personality.\r\n\r\nNow the artist of the lady of dark headgear let his imagination run\r\nfree and produced a face typical of all the sins of the Decalogue. We\r\nmay therefore take it on the ground of form as well as that of colour\r\nthat priority of date is to be given to Mother Black-Cap. There is\r\ngood ground for belief that this deduction is correct. Naturally the\r\nowner of the earliest public-house wished to make it as attractive as\r\npossible; and as Camden Town was a suburb through which the northern\r\ntraffic passed on its way to and from London, it was wise to use\r\nfor publicity and entertainment names that were familiar to north\r\ncountry ears. Before the railways were organised the great wheeled\r\nand horse-traffic between London and the North--especially Yorkshire\r\nwhich was one of the first Counties to take up manufacturing and had\r\nalready most of the wool trade--went through Camden Town. So it was\r\nwise forethought to take as an inn sign a Yorkshire name. The name\r\nof Mother Shipton had been in men’s mouths and ears for about two\r\nhundred years, and as the times had so changed that the old stigma of\r\nwitchcraft was not then understood, the association of the name with\r\nKnaresborough alone remained. And so Mother Shipton of Knaresborough\r\nwas intended as the prototype of the inn portrait with black headgear\r\nat Camden Town. In the ordinary course of development and business one\r\nof the two inns succeeded and lasted better than the other. And as\r\nMother Red-Cap has as a name supplanted Mother Damnable, we may with\r\nsome understanding discuss who that lady was.\r\n\r\nShe was a well-known shrew of Kentish Town, daughter of one Jacob\r\nBingham, a local brickmaker, who had married the daughter of a Scotch\r\npedlar manifestly not of any high moral character as shown by her\r\nlater acts and the general mistrust which attended them. They had\r\none daughter, Jinny, who in wickedness outdid her parents. She was\r\nnaturally warm-blooded and had a child when she was sixteen by a man of\r\nno account, George Coulter, known as Gipsy George. Whatever affection\r\nmay have existed between them was cut short by his arrest--and\r\nsubsequent execution at Tyburn--for sheepstealing. In her second\r\nquasi-matrimonial venture Jinny lived a cat-and-dog life with a man\r\ncalled Darby who spent his time in getting drunk and trying to get\r\nover it. Number Two’s end was also tragic. After a violent quarrel\r\nwith his companion he disappeared. Then there was domestic calm for a\r\nwhile, possibly due to the fact that Bingham and his wife were being\r\ntried also on a charge of witchcraft, complicated with another capital\r\ncharge of procuring the death of a young woman. They were both hanged\r\nand thereafter Jinny found time for another episode of love-making and\r\ntook up with a man called Pitcher. He too disappeared, but his body,\r\nburned almost to a cinder, was discovered in a neighbouring oven. Jinny\r\nwas tried for murder, but escaped on the plea that the man often took\r\nrefuge in the oven when he wished to get beyond reach of the woman’s\r\nvenomous tongue, to which fact witness was borne by certain staunch\r\ncompanions of Miss Bingham.\r\n\r\nJinny’s third venture towards happy companionship, though it lasted\r\nmuch longer, was attended with endless bitter quarrelling, and came\r\nto an equally tragic end, had at the beginning a spice of romance.\r\nThis individual, whose name has seemingly not been recorded, being\r\npursued in Commonwealth times for some unknown offence, had sought her\r\naid in attempting to escape. This she had graciously accorded, with\r\nthe consequence that they lived together some years in the greatest\r\nunhappiness.\r\n\r\nAt length he died--of poison, but by whom administered did not\r\ntranspire at the inquest. For the rest of her life Miss Bingham,\r\nwho was now old, lived under the suspicion of being a witch. Her\r\nostensible occupation was as a teller of fortunes and a healer of\r\nodd diseases--occupations which singly or together make neither for\r\npersonal esteem or general confidence. Her public appearances were\r\nusually attended by hounding and baiting by the rabble; and whenever\r\nanything went wrong in her neighbourhood the blame was, with overt\r\nviolence of demeanour, attributed to her. She did not even receive any\r\nof the respect usually shown to a freeholder--which she was, having\r\nby her father’s death become owner of a house which he had built for\r\nhimself with his own hands on waste ground. Her only protector was that\r\nusual favourite of witches, a black cat, whose devotion to her and\r\nwhose savage nature, accompanied by the public fear shown for an animal\r\nwhich was deemed her “familiar,” caused the mob to flee before its\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy and mystery of her life were even exceeded by those of her\r\ndeath. When, having been missed for some time, her house was entered\r\nshe, attended only by her cat and with her crutch by her side, was\r\nfound crouching beside the cold ashes of her extinct fire. In the\r\ntea-pot beside her was some liquid, seemingly brewed from herbs.\r\nWilling hands administered some of this to the black cat, whose hair,\r\nwithin a very short time, fell off. The cat forthwith died. Then the\r\nclamour began. Very many people suddenly remembered having seen,\r\nafter her last appearance in public, the Devil entering her house. No\r\none, however, had seen him come out again. What a pity it was that no\r\nveracious scribe or draughtsman was present in the crowd which had\r\nnoticed the Devil’s entry to the house. In such case we might have got\r\na real likeness of His Satanic Majesty--a thing which has long been\r\nwanted--and the opportunities of obtaining which are few.\r\n\r\nOne peculiar fact is recorded of Madame Damnable’s burial; her body was\r\nso stiff from the _rigor mortis_--or from some other cause--that the\r\nundertakers had to break her limbs before they could put her body in\r\nthe coffin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nF. MATTHEW HOPKINS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one thing more evil than oppression in the shape of\r\nwrong-doing, and that is oppression in the guise of good. Tennyson,\r\nin one of his poems, speaks of the dishonest pharmacist who “pestles\r\na poison’d poison.” This is a refinement of iniquity; a poisoned\r\npoison is not even an enlargement of evil but a structural change\r\neliminating the intention of good and replacing it with evil intent.\r\nWitches were quite bad enough; or rather they would have been, had that\r\nwhich was alleged of them been true. But a man who got his living by\r\ncreating suspicion regarding them and following it out to the practical\r\nconsummation of a hideous death, was a thousand times worse. To-day\r\nsuch a functionary as a witch-finder exists, it is true; but only\r\namongst the very lowest and most debased savages. And it is only by the\r\nrecorded types made known to us that it is possible even to guess at\r\nthe iniquity of their measures, the vileness of their actions. In the\r\nfull tally of the two centuries during which the witch mania existed\r\nin England, it is impossible to parallel the baseness of the one man\r\nwho distinguished himself in this loathsome occupation. The facts of\r\nhis history speak for themselves. Matthew Hopkins was born in Suffolk\r\nearly in the seventeenth century. He was the son of a minister, James\r\nHopkins of Wenham. He was brought up for the law, and when enrolled\r\nas an attorney, practised in Ipswich; but after a while he moved to\r\nManningtree where, after he had given up the law, he took to the\r\ncalling of witch-finder, being the first person in England to follow\r\nthat honourable trade.\r\n\r\nIf he had had no suitable opportunities of earning an honest livelihood\r\nand been graced with no education, some excuse might have been offered\r\nfor his despicable calling. But when we remember that he passed his\r\nyouth in a household practising religion, and was a member of a learned\r\nprofession, it is difficult to find words sufficiently comprehensive\r\nfor the fit expression of our natural indignation against him. If\r\npicturesque profanity were allowable, it might be well applied to\r\nthis despicable wretch and his nefarious labours. In no imaginable\r\ncircumstances could there possibly be anything to be said in mitigation\r\nof his infamy. When we think that the whole ritual of oppression was\r\nin his own hands--that he began with lying and perjury, and ended with\r\nmurder; that he showed, throughout, ruthless callousness for the mental\r\nand physical torture of great numbers of the most helpless class of\r\nthe community, the poor, the weak, the suffering, the helpless and\r\nhopeless; that when once his foul imagination had consecrated any poor\r\nwretch to destruction, or his baleful glance had unhappily lighted\r\non some unsuspecting victim there was for such only the refuge of\r\ndeath, and that by some means of prolonged torture, we cannot find\r\nany hope or prospect even in evil dreams of the nether world, of any\r\nadequate punishment for his dreadful sins. When we remember that this\r\none man--if man he can be called--was in himself responsible for what\r\namounted to the murder of some two hundred women whom he pursued to the\r\ndeath, the magnitude of his guilt can be guessed but not realised.\r\n\r\nHe occupied three whole years in his fell work; and in those years,\r\n1644, 1645 and 1646, he caused a regular reign of terror throughout\r\nthe counties of Huntingdon, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. He had a gang\r\nof his own to help him in his gruesome work of “discovering” witches;\r\namongst whom was a wretch called John Stern and--to her shame--a woman,\r\nwhose name is unrecorded. These three had a sort of mock assize of\r\ntheir own. They made regular tours of discovery, at a charge of twenty\r\nshillings for expenses at each place they visited. There appears to\r\nhave been a fee paid or exacted for each witch “bagged”; and such was\r\nhis greed that after a while he actually lowered the price. In 1645,\r\nwhich was perhaps his “best” year, the price declined to a shilling\r\na head. Hopkins and his gang took comfort, however, from the fact\r\nthat the industry was a growing one. The trade had only been initiated\r\nin 1644, and already in a year’s time he had in one day procured\r\nthe execution of eighteen alleged witches; and at the end of that\r\nassize, after the gaol delivery had been effected, one hundred and\r\ntwenty suspects still awaited trial. In the skilful hands of Matthew\r\nHopkins, trial was only a step on the road to certain execution by one\r\nof the forms in use. Here came in, not only the witchfinder’s legal\r\nknowledge, but also his gift of invention--the latter being used in the\r\nformulation of so-called “tests” which were bound to be effective. Of\r\nthese the simplest was the water test. The subject’s thumbs were tied\r\ntogether and she was then thrown into water of sufficient depth. If she\r\ndid not drown, it was taken as a proof of guilt; and she was hanged\r\nby form of law. In some cases, as an alternative, she was burned. If\r\nshe did not stand the test her friends had the pleasure of knowing\r\nthat she was pronounced to have died innocent. In any case there was\r\nno further trouble with her. Such was the accuracy as well as the\r\nsimplicity of similar “tests” that, in the twenty years previous to the\r\nRestoration, between three and four thousand alleged witches perished\r\nin England from one cause or another. Hopkins professed to be both\r\njust and merciful. He seemed generally willing to afford a “test” to\r\nthe accused; though, truth to tell, the result was always the same.\r\nIn such cases the test was eminently calculated to evoke confession,\r\nand such confession, no matter how ridiculous or extravagant it\r\nmight be, was simply a curved road to the rope or the torch instead\r\nof a straight one. One of these pleasing “tests” was to place the\r\nold woman--they were all women and all old--sitting cross-legged on\r\na stool or table where she could be well watched. She was generally\r\nkept in that position under inspection, without food or water, for\r\ntwenty-four hours. At the end of that time such resolution as had\r\nremained disappeared, and in the vain blind hope of some change for the\r\nbetter, some alleviation however slight of the grinding misery, of the\r\nagony of body and mind and soul, they confessed. And such confessions!\r\nThe very consideration of such of them as now remain in the cold\r\nthird-person method of a mere recorder, almost makes one weep; there\r\nis hardly a word that is not almost a certificate of character. With\r\nevery desire to confess--for such was the last hope of pleasing their\r\ntorturers--their utter ignorance of confessional matter is almost a\r\nproof of innocence.\r\n\r\nJust imagine the scene--a village or hamlet, or the poorer quarter\r\nof a small country town with squalid surroundings, marking a poverty\r\nwhich in this age has no equal; a poor, old, lonely woman whose long\r\nlife of sordid misery, of hunger and the diseases that huddle closely\r\naround want, hopeless, despairing, recognising her fate through the\r\nprolonged physical torture with which age and infirmity rendered her\r\nunable even to attempt to cope. Round her gathered, in a sickly ring,\r\na crowd of creatures debased by the exercise of greed and cruelty to a\r\nlower level than the beasts. Their object is not to inquire, to test,\r\nto judge; but only to condemn, to wreck, to break, to shatter. Some\r\nof them, she realises even in her agony, are spurred on by the same\r\nzeal which animated the cruelty of followers of Ignatius in the grim\r\ntorture-chambers of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe poor dazed, suffering old creature, racked with pains prolonged\r\nbeyond endurance, tries to rally such glimmerings of invention as\r\nare possible to her untaught, unfed mind; but finds herself at every\r\nfailure fluttering helplessly against a wall of spiritual granite which\r\ngives back not even an echo to her despairing cry. At last she comes\r\nto that stage where even fright and fear have no standing room, and\r\nwhere the blank misery of suffering ceases to be effective. Then the\r\nlast flicker of desire for truth or rectitude of purpose dies away, and\r\nshe receives in feeble acquiescence such suggestions as are shouted\r\nor whispered to her, in the hope that by accepting them she may win a\r\nmoment’s ease of body or mind, even if it be her last on earth. Driven\r\nbeyond mortal limits her untutored mind gives way; and with the last\r\nremnants of her strength she yields her very soul to her persecutors.\r\nThe end does not matter to her now. Life has no more to offer her--even\r\nof pain, which is the last conscious tie to existence. And through\r\nit all, ghoul-like, watching and waiting for the collapse, whilst\r\noutwardly he goes through the mechanical ritual of prayer, we see in\r\nthe background the sinister figure of the attorney, preparing in his\r\nmind such evidence as he may procure or invent for his work of the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt needs the imagination of a Dante to consider what should be the\r\nplace of such an one in history, and any eternity of punishment that\r\nthat imagination could suggest must be inadequate. Even pity itself\r\nwhich rests on sympathy and is kin to the eternal spirit of justice,\r\nwould have imagined with satisfaction the wretched soul going through a\r\nbaleful eternity clinging in perpetual agony of fear to the very King\r\nof Terrors.\r\n\r\nIn judging Matthew Hopkins one must not, in justice to others, accord\r\nhim any of the consideration which is the due of good intent. Not a\r\nscore of years after his shameful death, a man was born in a newer land\r\nfar beyond the separating sea, who through his influence, his teaching,\r\nthe expression of his honest conviction, was the cause of perhaps more\r\ndeaths than the English anti-witch. We refer to Cotton Mather, who\r\nbelieved he wrought for the Lord--in his own way--in New England. But\r\nguilt does not attach to him. He was an earnest, though mistaken man,\r\nand the results of his mistaken teaching were at variance with the\r\ntrend of his kindly, godly life.\r\n\r\nIt must be pleasing to the spirit of the Old Adam which is in us\r\nall in some form, to think of the manner of the death of Matthew\r\nHopkins. Three years had exhausted not only the material available\r\nfor his chosen work, but, what was worse for him, the patience of the\r\ncommunity. Moreover, he had given cause for scandal in even his own\r\ndegraded trade and in himself, the filthiest thing in connection with\r\nit. Not content with dealing with the poor, helpless folk, whom he\r\nhad come to regard as his natural prey, he went on fancy flights of\r\noppression. At last he went too far. He ventured to denounce an aged\r\nclergyman of blameless life. The witch-fever was too strong for justice\r\nin any form, and neither age, high character, nor sacred office could\r\nprotect this gentleman of eighty years of age. He too was tortured,\r\ntill in a moment of unhinged mind, he confessed as he was ordered,\r\nand was duly hanged. This was in 1645. The old man’s death was not in\r\nvain, for it was made the occasion of much necessary plain speaking.\r\nPresently the public conscience was wakened; chiefly by another cleric,\r\nthe Rev. John Caule, vicar of Great Staughton, Huntingdonshire--all\r\nhonour to him!--who, though strange to say he believed in witchcraft,\r\nrealised the greater evil wrought by men like Hopkins. He published\r\na pamphlet in which he denounced Hopkins as a common nuisance. The\r\nresult, if slow, was sure. The witch-finder never recovered from the\r\nshock of Caule’s vigorous attack. In 1647, on information based on\r\nHopkins’ own rules, he was arrested and subjected to the test which\r\nhe had devised: he was tied by the thumbs and thrown into the water.\r\nUnfortunately for himself he withstood the test--drowning, except for a\r\nshort period of pangs, is an easy death--and so was by process of Law\r\nduly hanged.\r\n\r\nOne can imagine how the whole atmosphere of the country--surcharged\r\nwith suspicion, fear, oppression, torture, perjury or crime--was\r\ncleared by the execration which followed the removal of this vile\r\nwretch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. ARTHUR ORTON\r\n\r\n(The Tichborne Claimant.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the annals of crime, Arthur Orton, the notorious claimant to the\r\nrich estates and title of Tichborne, takes a foremost place; not only\r\nas the originator of one of the most colossal attempts at fraud on\r\nrecord, but also from his remarkable success in duping the public. It\r\nwould be difficult indeed to furnish a more striking example of the\r\nheight to which the blind credulity of people will occasionally attain.\r\nOf pretenders, who by pertinacious and unscrupulous lying have sought\r\nto bolster up fictitious claims, there have been many before Orton;\r\nbut he certainly surpassed all his predecessors in working out the\r\nlie circumstantial in such a way as to divide the country for years\r\ninto two great parties--those who believed in the Claimant, and those\r\nwho did not. Over one hundred persons, drawn from every class, and\r\nfor the most part honest in their belief, swore to the identity of\r\nthis illiterate butcher’s son--this stockman, mail-rider and probably\r\nbushranger and thief--as the long-lost son and heir of the ancient\r\nhouse of Tichborne of Titchborne. To gain his own selfish ends this\r\nindividual was ready to rob a gentlewoman of her fair fame, to destroy\r\nthe peace of a great family who, to free themselves from a persecution,\r\nas cruel as it was vicious, had to be pilloried before a ruthless and\r\nunsympathising mob, to have the privacy of their home invaded, and\r\nto hear their women’s names banded from one coarse mouth to another.\r\nThus, and through no fault of their own, they were compelled to endure\r\na mental torture far worse than any physical suffering, besides having\r\nto expend vast sums of money, as well as time and labour, in order to\r\nprotect themselves from the would-be depredations of an unscrupulous\r\nadventurer. It has been estimated that the resistance of this\r\nfictitious claim cost the Tichborne estate not far short of one hundred\r\nthousand pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _Photo. by Maull & Fox. Copyright._\r\n\r\nARTHUR ORTON]\r\n\r\nThe baronetcy of Tichborne, now Doughty-Tichborne, is one of the\r\noldest. It has been claimed that the family held possession of the\r\nManor of Tichborne for two hundred years before the Conquest. Be\r\nthis as it may--and, in the light of J. H. Round’s revelations, some\r\nscepticism as to these pre-Norman pedigrees is permissible--their\r\nancestors may be traced back to one Walter de Tichborne who held the\r\nmanor, from which he took his name, as early as 1135. Their names too,\r\nare interwoven with the history of the country. Sir Benjamin, the first\r\nbaronet--for the earlier de Tichbornes were knights,--as Sheriff of\r\nSouthhampton, on the death of Queen Elizabeth, repaired instantly\r\nto Winchester and on his own initiative proclaimed the accession of\r\nJames VI of Scotland as King of England, for which service he was made\r\na baronet, and his four sons received the honour of knighthood. His\r\nsuccessor, Sir Richard, was a zealous supporter of the Royal cause\r\nduring the civil wars. Sir Henry, the third baronet, hazarded his life\r\nin the defence of Charles I and had his estates sequestered by the\r\nParliamentarians though he was recompensed at the Restoration.\r\n\r\nBelievers in occultism might see in the trials and tribulations\r\nbrought down upon the unfortunate heads of the Tichborne family by the\r\nmachinations of the Claimant, the realisation of the doom pronounced by\r\na certain Dame Ticheborne away back in the days of Henry II.\r\n\r\nSir Roger de Ticheborne of those days married Mabell, the daughter and\r\nheiress of Ralph de Lamerston, of Lamerston, in the Isle of Wight, by\r\nwhom he acquired that estate. This good wife played the part of lady\r\nbountiful of the neighbourhood. After a life spent in acts of charity\r\nand goodness, as her end drew nigh and she lay on her death bed, her\r\nthoughts went out to her beloved poor. She begged her husband, that in\r\norder to have her memory kept green the countryside round, he would\r\ngrant a bequest sufficient to ensure, once a year, a dole of bread to\r\nall comers to the gates of Tichborne. To gratify her whim Sir Roger\r\npromised her as much land as she could encompass while a brand plucked\r\nfrom the fire should continue to burn. As the poor lady had been\r\nbedridden for years her husband may have had no idea that she could,\r\neven if she would, take his promise seriously. However, the venerable\r\ndame, after being carried out upon the ground, seemed to regain her\r\nstrength in a miraculous fashion, and, to the surprise of all, managed\r\nto crawl round several rich and goodly acres which to this day are\r\nknown as “the Crawls.”\r\n\r\nCarried to her bed again after making this last supreme effort and\r\nsummoning her family to her bedside, Lady Ticheborne predicted with her\r\ndying breath, that, as long as this annual dole was continued, so long\r\nshould the house of Tichborne prosper; but, should it be neglected,\r\ntheir fortunes would fail and the family name become extinct from want\r\nof male issue. As a sure sign by which these disasters might be looked\r\nfor, she foretold that a generation of seven sons would be immediately\r\nfollowed by one of seven daughters.\r\n\r\nThe benevolent custom thus established was faithfully observed for\r\ncenturies. On every Lady Day crowds of humble folk came from near\r\nand far to partake of the famous dole which consisted of hundreds of\r\nsmall loaves. But ultimately the occasion degenerated into a noisy\r\nmerry-making, a sort of fair, until it was finally discontinued in\r\n1796, owing to the complaints of the magistrates and local gentry that\r\nthe practice encouraged vagabonds, gipsies and idlers of all sorts to\r\nswarm into the neighbourhood under pretence of receiving the dole.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough Sir Henry Tichborne, the baronet of that day (the\r\noriginal name of de Ticheborne had by this time been reduced to\r\nTichborne), had seven sons, while his eldest son who succeeded him in\r\n1821, had seven daughters. The extinction of the family name, too,\r\ncame to pass, for in the absence of male issue, Sir Henry, the eighth\r\nbaronet, was succeeded by his brother, who had taken the surname of\r\nDoughty on coming into the estates bequeathed to him on these terms, by\r\na distant relative, Miss Doughty; though, in after years, his brother,\r\nwho in turn succeeded him, obtained the royal licence to couple the\r\nold family name with that of Doughty. Following this repeated lapse of\r\ndirect male heirs came other troubles; but it is to be hoped that the\r\nsuccessful defeat of the fraudulent claim of Arthur Orton set a period\r\nto the doom pronounced long years ago by the Lady Mabell.\r\n\r\nMost families, great and small, have their secret troubles and\r\nunpleasantness, and the Tichbornes seem to have had their share of\r\nthem. To this may be traced the actual, if remote, cause of the\r\nClaimant’s imposture. James Tichborne, afterwards the tenth baronet,\r\nthe father of the missing Roger, who was drowned in the mysterious\r\nloss of the _Bella_, off the coast of South America, in the spring of\r\n1854, lived abroad for many years; but, while his wife was French in\r\nevery sentiment, he himself from time to time exhibited a keen desire\r\nto return to his native land. When Roger was born there was small\r\nlikelihood of his ever succeeding to either title or estates, and so\r\nhis education was almost entirely a foreign one.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Tichborne, who had succeeded in 1821, though blessed with\r\nseven beautiful daughters, had no son. Still there was their uncle\r\nEdward, who had taken the name of Doughty, and he, after Sir Henry,\r\nwas the next heir. Edward, too, had a son and daughter. But, one day,\r\nnews came to James and his wife, in France, that their little nephew\r\nwas dead; and with the possibilities which this change opened up, it\r\nbrought home to the father the error he had committed in permitting\r\nRoger to grow up ignorant of the English tongue and habits. It was\r\nmanifest that Mr. James F. Tichborne was not unlikely to become the\r\nnext baronet, and he felt it his bounden duty to make good his previous\r\nneglect, by providing his son with an English education, such as would\r\nfit him for his probable position as head of the house of Tichborne.\r\nIn this praiseworthy intention he met with strong opposition from his\r\nwife whose great aim it was to see her son grow up a Frenchman. To her,\r\nFrance was the only land worth living in. She cared nought for family\r\ntraditions; her dream was that her darling boy should marry into some\r\ndistinguished family in France or Italy. If he was to enter the army,\r\nthen it should be in some foreign service. But to England he should\r\nnot go if she could prevent it.\r\n\r\nJames Tichborne, like many weak men with self-willed wives, put off\r\nthe inevitable day as long as he could; and in the end only achieved\r\nhis purpose by strategy. Roger was sixteen years of age when news\r\narrived of the death of Sir Henry. Naturally James arranged to be\r\npresent at his brother’s funeral and it was only reasonable that he\r\nshould be accompanied by his son Roger, whom everyone now regarded as\r\nthe heir. Accordingly the boy took leave of his mother, but under the\r\nsolemn injunction to return quickly. However, his father had determined\r\notherwise. After attending the funeral of his uncle, at the old chapel\r\nat Tichborne, Roger was, by the advice of relatives and friends, and\r\nwith the consent of the boy himself, taken down to the Jesuit College\r\nat Stonyhurst. When Mrs. Tichborne learned of this step, her fury knew\r\nno bounds. She upbraided her husband violently; and there was a renewal\r\nof the old scenes in the Tichborne establishment. Roger wrote his\r\nmother filial, if ill-spelt, letters in French; but, for a year, the\r\nson, though ardently looking for a letter, got no token of affection\r\nfrom the incensed and indignant lady.\r\n\r\nDuring his three years’ stay at Stonyhurst, Roger seems to have applied\r\nhimself diligently to the study of English; but, though he made fair\r\nprogress, he was never able to speak it with as much purity and\r\ncommand of words as when conversing in French. In Latin, mathematics,\r\nand chemistry, too, he contrived to make fair headway; while his\r\nletters evidenced an inclination for the study of polite literature.\r\nIf not highly accomplished, he was of a refined and sensitive nature.\r\nDuring this period he made many friends, spending his vacation with his\r\nEnglish relatives in turn. His great delight was to stay at Tichborne,\r\nthen in possession of his father’s brother, Sir Edward Doughty. Withal,\r\nthe shy, pale-faced boy steadily gained in favour, for he had a nature\r\nwhich disarmed ill-feeling. As time wore on it became necessary to\r\ndetermine on some profession for the lad; and needless to say his\r\nfather’s choice of the army added fuel to the fire of his wife’s anger.\r\nAfter some delay a commission was obtained and Mr. Roger Charles\r\nTichborne was gazetted a coronet in the Sixth Dragoons, better known as\r\nthe Carbineers.\r\n\r\nDefeated in her purpose of making a Frenchman of her boy, Roger’s\r\nmother yet continued to harp upon her old desire to marry him to one\r\nof the Italian princesses of whom he had heard so much. But Roger\r\nhad other ideas, for he had fallen passionately in love with his\r\ncousin--Miss Katharine Doughty afterwards Lady Radcliffe. However, the\r\ncourse of love was not to run smooth. The Tichbornes had always been\r\nRoman Catholic, and the marriage of first cousins was discountenanced\r\nby that church. Consequently when some little token incidentally\r\nrevealed to the father the secret and yet unspoken love of the young\r\npeople, their dream was rudely shattered.\r\n\r\nThat the girl warmly reciprocated her cousin’s affection was beyond\r\nquestion, and Lady Doughty was certainly sympathetic though she took\r\nexception to certain of her nephew’s habits. He was an inveterate\r\nsmoker besides drinking too freely. These and other little failings\r\nseem to have aroused some fear in her anxious mother’s heart, though\r\nshe quite recognised the boy’s kind disposition, and the fact that he\r\nwas truthful, honourable and scrupulous in points of duty. Still she\r\nwould not oppose the wishes of the young lovers--except to the extent\r\nof pleading and encouraging Roger to master his weaknesses. It was\r\nChristmas time in 1851 when the _dénoument_ came and the eyes of Sir\r\nEdward were opened to what was going on. He was both vexed and angry,\r\nand was resolved that the engagement should be broken off before it\r\ngrew more serious. One last interview was permitted to the cousins\r\nand, this over, the young man was to leave the house forever. The\r\ngreat hope of his life extinguished, there was nothing left for Roger\r\nbut to rejoin his regiment, then expecting orders for India, and to\r\nendeavour to forget the past. Still even in those dark days neither\r\nRoger nor Kate quite gave up hope of some change. Lady Doughty, despite\r\nher dread of her nephew’s habits, had a warm regard for him, and could\r\nbe relied upon to plead his cause; and in a short time circumstances\r\nunexpectedly favoured him. Sir Edward was ill and, fearing that death\r\nwas approaching, he sent for his nephew and revived the subject. He\r\nexplained that if it were not for the close relationship he should\r\nhave no objection to the marriage and begged Roger to wait for three\r\nyears. If then the affection, one for the other, remained unaltered,\r\nand providing that Roger obtained his own father’s consent and that\r\nof the Church, he would accept things as the will of God and agree to\r\nthe union. As might be expected, Roger gratefully promised loyally to\r\nobserve the sick man’s wishes.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sir Edward, instead of dying, slowly mended, and Roger\r\nreturned to his regiment. Occasionally he would spend his leave with\r\nhis aunt and uncle, when the young people loved to walk together in the\r\nbeautiful gardens of Tichborne exchanging sweet confidences and weaving\r\nplans for the future. On what proved to be his last visit to his\r\nancestral home, in the midsummer of 1852, Roger, to comfort his cousin,\r\nconfided a secret to her--a copy of a vow, which he had written out and\r\nsigned, solemnly pledging himself, in the event of their being married\r\nbefore three years had passed, to build a church or chapel at Tichborne\r\nas a thanks offering to the Holy Virgin for the protection shown by her\r\nin praying God that their wishes might be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nHis leave up, Roger went back to his regiment more than ever a prey\r\nto his habitual melancholy. To his great regret the orders for the\r\nCarbineers to go to India were countermanded. He accordingly determined\r\nto throw up his commission and travel abroad until his period of\r\nprobation had passed. South America had long been the subject of his\r\ndreams, and so thither he would make his way; and in travelling through\r\nthat vast continent he hoped to find occupation for his mind and so get\r\nthrough the trying period of waiting. His plan was to spend a year in\r\nChili, Guayaquil and Peru, and thence to visit Mexico, and so, by way\r\nof the United States, to return home. Having come to this resolution\r\nhe lost no time in putting it into execution. Being of business-like\r\nhabits he made his will, in which he purposely omitted any mention\r\nof the “church or chapel.” This secret had already been committed to\r\npaper, and with other precious souvenirs of his love for his cousin,\r\nhad been confided to his most trusted friend--Mr. Gosford, the steward\r\nof the family estate. After paying a round of farewell visits to his\r\nparents and old friends in Paris, Roger finally set sail from Havre, on\r\nMarch 21, 1853, in a French vessel named _La Pauline_, for Valparaiso,\r\nat which port she arrived on the 19th of the following June, when Roger\r\nset out on his wanderings. During his travels Roger continued to write\r\nhome regularly; but the first news he received was bad. Sir Edward\r\nDoughty had died almost before the _Pauline_ had lost sight of the\r\nEnglish shores; and Roger’s father and mother were now Sir James and\r\nLady Tichborne.\r\n\r\nPresently the wanderer began to retrace his steps, making his way to\r\nRio de Janeiro. Here, he found a vessel called the _Bella_ hailing from\r\nLiverpool, about to sail for Kingston, Jamaica, and as he had directed\r\nhis letters and remittances to be forwarded there, he prevailed upon\r\nthe captain to give him a passage. On the 20th of April, 1854, the\r\n_Bella_ passed from the port of Rio into the ocean. From that day no\r\none ever set eyes upon her. Six days after she left harbour, a ship\r\ntraversing her path found, amongst other ominous tokens of a wreck, a\r\ncapsized long-boat bearing the name “_Bella_, Liverpool.”\r\n\r\nThese were taken into Rio and forthwith the authorities caused the\r\nneighbouring seas to be scoured in quest of survivors; but none were\r\never found. That the _Bella_ had foundered there was little room to\r\ndoubt. It was supposed that she had been caught in a sudden squall,\r\nthat her cargo had shifted, and that, unable to right herself, the\r\nvessel had gone down in deep water, giving but little warning to those\r\non board. In a few months the sad news reached Tichborne, where the\r\nabsence of letters from the previously diligent correspondent had\r\nalready raised grave fears. The sorrow-stricken father caused enquiries\r\nto be made in America and elsewhere. For a time, there was a faint hope\r\nthat some one aboard the _Bella_ might have been picked up by some\r\npassing vessel; but, as months wore on, even these small hopes dwindled\r\naway. The letters which poor Roger had so anxiously asked might be\r\ndirected to him at the post office, Kingston, Jamaica, remained there\r\ntill the ink grew faded; the banker’s bill which lay at the agents’\r\nremained unclaimed. At last the unfortunate vessel was finally written\r\noff at Lloyd’s as lost, the insurance money paid, and gradually the\r\n_Bella_ faded from the memories of all but those who had lost friends\r\nor relatives in her. Lady Tichborne alone, refused to abandon hope.\r\n\r\nHer obstinate disregard of such conclusive evidence of the fate of her\r\nunfortunate son preyed upon her mind to such an extent as to make her\r\nan easy victim for any scheming rascal pretending to have news of her\r\nlost son; and “sailors,” who told all sorts of wild stories of how\r\nsome of the survivors of the _Bella_ had been rescued and landed in a\r\nforeign port, became constant visitors at Tichborne Park and profited\r\nhandsomely from the weak-minded lady’s credulity. Sir James, himself,\r\nmade short work of these tramping “sailors,” but after his death,\r\nin 1862, the lady became even more ready to be victimised by their\r\nspecious lies.\r\n\r\nFirm in her belief that Roger was still alive, Lady Tichborne now\r\ncaused advertisements to be inserted in numerous papers; and in\r\nNovember, 1865, she learnt through an agency in Sydney that a man\r\nanswering the description of her son had been found in Wagga Wagga,\r\nNew South Wales. A long correspondence ensued, the tone and character\r\nof which ought to have put her on her guard; but, over-anxious to\r\nbelieve that she had indeed found her long-lost son, any wavering\r\ndoubts she may have had, were swept from her mind by the evidence of\r\nan aged negro servant named Boyle, an old pensioner of the Tichborne\r\nfamily. Boyle, who lived in New South Wales, professed to recognise the\r\nClaimant as his dear young master, and he certainly remained one of his\r\nmost devoted adherents to the end. Undoubtedly this man’s simplicity\r\nproved a very valuable asset to Orton. His intimate knowledge of the\r\narrangements of Tichborne Park was pumped dry by his new master, who,\r\naided by a most tenacious memory, was afterwards able to use the\r\ninformation thus obtained with startling effect.\r\n\r\nAs to the identity of the Claimant with Arthur Orton there can be\r\nabsolutely no doubt. As a result of the enquiries made by the trustees\r\nof the Tichborne estate nearly the whole of his history was unmasked.\r\nHe was born, in 1834, at Wapping where his father kept a butcher’s\r\nshop. In 1848 he took passage to Valparaiso, whence he made his way up\r\ncountry to Melipilla. Here he stayed some eighteen months receiving\r\nmuch kindness from a family named Castro, and it was their name he\r\nwent under at Wagga Wagga. In 1851 he returned home and entering his\r\nfather’s business became an expert slaughterman. The following year\r\nhe emigrated to Australia; but after the spring of 1854 he ceased to\r\ncorrespond with his family. He had evidently led a life of hardship\r\nand adventure--probably not unattended with crime, and certainly with\r\npoverty. At Wagga Wagga he carried on a small butcher’s business, and\r\nit was from here that he got into communication with Lady Tichborne\r\njust after his marriage to an illiterate servant girl.\r\n\r\nAccording to his subsequent confession, until his attention was drawn\r\nto the advertisement for the missing Roger, he had never even heard of\r\nthe name of Tichborne, and it was only his success when, by way of a\r\njoke upon a chum, he claimed to be the missing baronet, that led him\r\nto pursue the matter in sober earnest. Indeed he seemed at first very\r\nreluctant to leave Australia, and probably he was only driven to accede\r\nto Lady Tichborne’s request, to return “home” at once, by the fact that\r\nhe had raised large sums of money on his expectations. His original\r\nintention was probably to obtain some sort of recognition, and then to\r\nreturn to Australia with whatever money he had succeeded in collecting.\r\n\r\nAfter wasting much time he left Australia and arrived in England, by\r\na very circuitous route, on Christmas Day, 1866. His first step on\r\nlanding, it was subsequently discovered, was to make a mysterious\r\nvisit to Wapping. His parents were dead, but his enquiries showed\r\na knowledge, both of the Orton family and the locality, which was\r\nafterwards used against him with very damaging effect. His next\r\nproceeding was to make a flying and surreptitious excursion to\r\nTichborne House, where, as far as possible, he acquainted himself with\r\nthe bearings of the place. In this he was greatly assisted by one Rous,\r\na former clerk to the old Tichborne attorney, who was then keeping a\r\npublic house in the place. From this man, who became his staunch ally,\r\nhe had no doubt acquired much useful information; and it is significant\r\nthat he sedulously kept clear of Mr. Gosford, the agent to whom the\r\nreal Roger had confided his sealed packet before leaving England.\r\n\r\nLady Tichborne was living in Paris at this time and it was here, in his\r\nhotel bedroom, on a dark January afternoon, that their first interview\r\ntook place for, curiously enough, the gentleman was too ill to leave\r\nhis bed! The deluded woman professed to recognise him at once. As\r\nshe sat beside his bed, “Roger” keeping his face turned to the wall,\r\nthe conversation took a wide range, the sick man showing himself\r\nstrangely astray. He talked to her of his grandfather, whom the real\r\nRoger had never seen; he said he had served in the ranks; referred to\r\nStonyhurst as Winchester; spoke of his suffering as a lad from St.\r\nVitus’s dance--a complaint which first led to young Arthur Orton being\r\nsent on a sea voyage; but did not speak of the rheumatism from which\r\nRoger had suffered. But it was all one to the infatuated woman--“He\r\nconfuses everything as if in a dream,” she wrote in exculpating him;\r\nbut unsatisfactory as this identification was, she never departed from\r\nher belief. She lived under the same roof with him for weeks, accepted\r\nhis wife and children, and allowed him £1,000 a year. It did not weigh\r\nwith her that the rest of the family unanimously declared him to be an\r\nimpostor, or that he failed to recognise them or to recall any incident\r\nin Roger’s life.\r\n\r\nNearly four years elapsed before the Claimant commenced his suit of\r\nejectment against the trustees of the infant Sir Alfred Tichborne--the\r\nposthumous son of Roger’s younger brother; but he utilised the time\r\nto good purpose. He had taken into his service a couple of old\r\nCarbineers who had been Roger’s servants and before long so completely\r\nmastered small details of regimental life that some thirty of Roger’s\r\nold brother-officers and men were convinced of his identity. He\r\nwent everywhere, called upon all Roger’s old friends, visited the\r\nCarbineers’ mess and generally left no stone unturned to get together\r\nevidence in support of his identity. As a result of his strenuous\r\nactivity and plausibility he produced at the first trial over one\r\nhundred witnesses who, on oath, identified him as Roger Tichborne;\r\nand these witnesses included Lady Tichborne, the family solicitor,\r\nmagistrates, officers and men from Roger’s old regiment besides various\r\nTichborne tenants and friends of the family. On the other hand, there\r\nwere only seventeen witnesses arraigned against him; and, in his own\r\nopinion, it was his own evidence that lost him the case. He would have\r\nwon, he said, “if only he could have kept his mouth shut.”\r\n\r\nThe trial of this action lasted 102 days. Sergeant Ballantine led for\r\nthe Claimant; and Sir John Coleridge (afterwards Lord Chief-justice),\r\nand Mr. Hawkins, Q. C. (afterwards Lord Brampton), for the trustees\r\nof the estates of Tichborne. The cross-examination of the Claimant at\r\nthe hands of Sir John Coleridge lasted twenty-two days, during which\r\nthe colossal ignorance he displayed was only equalled by his boldness,\r\ndexterity and the bull-dog tenacity with which he faced the ordeal.\r\nTo quote Sir John’s own words: “The first sixteen years of his life\r\nhe has absolutely forgotten; the few facts he had told the jury were\r\nalready proved, or would hereafter be shown, to be absolutely false and\r\nfabricated. Of his college life he could recollect nothing. About his\r\namusements, his books, his music, his games, he could tell nothing.\r\nNot a word of his family, of the people with whom he lived, their\r\nhabits, their persons, their very names. He had forgotten his mother’s\r\nmaiden name; he was ignorant of all particulars of the family estate;\r\nhe remembered nothing of Stonyhurst; and in military matters he was\r\nequally deficient. Roger, born and educated in France, spoke and wrote\r\nFrench like a native and his favourite reading was French literature;\r\nbut the Claimant knew nothing of French. Of the ‘sealed’ packet he\r\nknew nothing and, when pressed, his interpretation of its contents\r\ncontained the foulest and blackest calumny of the cousin whom Roger had\r\nso fondly loved. This was proved by Mr. Gosford, to whom the packet had\r\nbeen originally entrusted, and by the production of the duplicate which\r\nRoger had given to Miss Doughty herself. The physical discrepancy, too,\r\nwas no less remarkable; for, while Roger, who took after his mother was\r\nslight and delicate, with narrow sloping shoulders, a long narrow face\r\nand thin straight dark hair, the Claimant was of enormous bulk, scaling\r\nover twenty-four stone, big-framed and burly, with a large round face\r\nand an abundance of fair and rather wavy hair. And yet, curiously\r\nenough, the Claimant undoubtedly possessed a strong likeness to several\r\nmale members of the Tichborne family.”\r\n\r\nWhen questioned as to the impressive episode of Roger’s love for his\r\ncousin, the Claimant showed himself hopelessly at sea. His answers\r\nwere confused and irreconcilable. Not only could he give no precise\r\ndates, but even the broad outline of the story was beyond him. Yet,\r\nfor good reasons, the Solicitor-General persisted in pressing him as\r\nto the contents of the sealed packet and compelled him to repeat the\r\nslanderous version of the incident which he had long ago given when\r\ninterrogated on the point. Mrs. Radcliffe (she was not then Lady) sat\r\nin court beside her husband, and thus had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nthe infamous charges brought against the fair fame of her girlhood\r\nrecoil on the head of the wretch who had resorted to such villainous\r\ndevices. Unfortunately, some years after Roger’s disappearance, Mr.\r\nGosford, feeling that he was neither justified in keeping the precious\r\npacket, nor in handing it to any other person, had burnt it; but,\r\nfortunately his testimony as to its contents was proved in the most\r\ncomplete manner by the production of the duplicate which poor Roger had\r\ngiven to his cousin on his last visit to Tichborne.\r\n\r\nWhere the case broke down most completely was in the matter of tattoo\r\nmarks. Roger had been freely tattooed. Among other marks he bore, on\r\nhis left arm, a cross, an anchor, and a heart which was testified to\r\nby the persons who had pricked them in. Orton, too, it was found out,\r\nhad also been tattooed on his left arm with his initials, “A. O.,”\r\nand, though neither remained, there was a mark which was sworn to be\r\nthe obliteration of those letters. Small wonder then that, on the top\r\nof this damning piece of evidence, the jury declared they required to\r\nhear nothing further, upon which the Claimant’s counsel, to avoid the\r\ninevitable verdict for their opponents, elected to be nonsuited. But\r\nthese tactics did not save their client, for he was at once arrested,\r\non the judge’s warrant, on the charge of wilful and corrupt perjury,\r\nand committed to Newgate where he remained until bail for £10,000 was\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\nA year later, on April 23, 1873, the Claimant was arraigned before\r\na special jury in the Court of Queen’s Bench. The proceedings were\r\nof a most prolix and unusual character. Practically the same ground\r\nwas covered as in the civil trial, only the process was reversed:\r\nthe Claimant having now to defend instead of to attack. Many of\r\nthe better-class witnesses, including the majority of Roger’s\r\nbrother-officers, now forsook the Claimant. There was a deal of\r\ncross-swearing. The climax of the long trial was the production by the\r\ndefence of a witness to support the Claimant’s account of his wreck\r\nand rescue. This was a man who called himself Jean Luie and claimed\r\nto be a Danish seaman. With a wealth of picturesque detail he told\r\nhow he was one of the crew of the _Osprey_ which had picked up a boat\r\nof the shipwrecked _Bella_, in which was the claimant and some of the\r\ncrew, and how when the _Osprey_ arrived at Melbourne, in the height\r\nof the gold fever, every man of the crew from the captain downwards\r\nhad deserted the ship and gone up country. According to his story from\r\nthat time forth he had seen nothing of any of the castaways; but having\r\ncome to England in search of his wife he had heard of the trial. When\r\nLuie was first brought into the presence of the Claimant that astute\r\nperson immediately claimed him with the greeting in Spanish “_Como\r\nesta, Luie?_”--“How are you, Luie?” The sailor with equal readiness\r\nrecognised Orton as the man he had helped to rescue years before. All\r\nthis sounded very convincing; but it would not stand investigation.\r\nFrom the beginning to end the thing was an invention; an examination\r\nof shipping records failed to find the _Osprey_ so that she must have\r\nescaped the notice of the authorities in every port she had entered\r\nfrom the day she was launched! Of “Sailor” Luie, however, a very\r\ncomplete record was established. Not only were the police able to prove\r\nthat, at the time he swore he was a seaman on board the _Osprey_,\r\nhe was actually employed by a firm at Hull; that he had never been\r\na seaman at all; but that he was a well-known habitual criminal and\r\nconvict only recently released on a ticket-of-leave. This made things\r\nvery awkward for the defence who made every effort to shake free from\r\nthe taint of such perjured evidence. Dr. Kenealy, seeing his dilemma,\r\ncontended that it had been concocted by Luie himself. But the damning\r\nand unanswerable fact remained--that, by his recognition of the man,\r\nthe Claimant had acknowledged a previous acquaintance with him which he\r\ncould only have had by being privy to the fraud.\r\n\r\nOn February 28, 1874, the one hundred and eighty-eighth day of the\r\ntrial, the jury after half-an-hour’s deliberation returned their\r\nverdict. They found that the defendant was not Roger Charles\r\nTichborne; that he was Arthur Orton; and finally that the charges made\r\nagainst Miss Catherine Doughty were not supported by the slightest\r\nevidence. Orton was sentenced to fourteen years’ penal servitude which,\r\nassuredly, was none too heavy for offences so enormous. The trial\r\nwas remarkable, not only for its inordinate length, but also for the\r\nextraordinary scenes by which it was characterised and for which Dr.\r\nKenealy, leading counsel for the defence, was primarily responsible.\r\nHis conduct was sternly denounced by the Lord Chief Justice in his\r\nsumming up as: “the torrent of undisguised and unlimited abuse in which\r\nthe learned counsel for the defence has thought fit to indulge,” and\r\nhe declared that “there never was in the history of jurisprudence a\r\ncase in which such an amount of imputation and invective had been used\r\nbefore.” After the trial was over, Dr. Kenealy tried to turn the case\r\ninto a national question through the medium of a virulent paper he\r\nstarted with the title of the _Englishman_; and undeterred by being\r\ndisbarred for his flagrant breaches of professional etiquette, he went\r\nabout the country delivering the most extravagant speeches concerning\r\nthe trial. He was elected Member of Parliament for Stoke, and, on April\r\n23, 1875, moved for a royal commission of inquiry into the conduct of\r\nthe Tichborne Case; but his motion was defeated by 433 votes to 1.\r\n\r\nThe verdict and sentence created enormous excitement throughout the\r\ncountry, for all classes, more or less, had subscribed to the defence\r\nfund. But, by the time Orton was released, in 1884, practically\r\nall interest had died away, and his effort to resuscitate it was a\r\nmiserable failure. In the sworn confession which he published in the\r\n_People_, in 1895, he told the whole story of the fraud from its\r\ninception to its final denouement. Orton survived his release from\r\nprison for fourteen years, but gradually sinking into poverty, he died\r\nin obscure lodgings in Shouldham Street, Marylebone, on April 1, 1898.\r\nTo the end he was a fraud and impostor for, before his death, he is\r\nsaid to have recanted his sworn confession, which nevertheless bore the\r\nstamp of truth and was in perfect accord with the information obtained\r\nby the prosecution, while his coffin bore the lying inscription: “Sir\r\nRoger Charles Doughty Tichborne; born 5th January, 1829; died 1st\r\nApril, 1898.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. WOMEN AS MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nA. THE MOTIVE FOR DISGUISE\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest forms of imposture--so common that it seems rooted\r\nin a phase of human nature--is that of women who disguise themselves\r\nas men. It is not to be wondered at that such attempts are made; or\r\nthat they were made more often formerly when social advancement had not\r\nenlarged the scope of work available for women. The legal and economic\r\ndisabilities of the gentler sex stood then so fixedly in the way of\r\nworking opportunity that women desirous of making an honest livelihood\r\ntook desperate chances to achieve their object. We have read of very\r\nmany cases in the past; and even now the hum-drum of life is broken by\r\nthe fact or the echo of some startling revelation of the kind. Only\r\nvery lately the death of a person who had for many years occupied a\r\nworthy though humble position in London caused a post-mortem sensation\r\nby the discovery that the deceased individual, though looked on for\r\nabout a quarter of a century as a man, a widower, and the father of\r\na grown-up daughter, was in reality a woman. She was actually buried\r\nunder the name of the man she had professed to be, Harry Lloyd.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that in more strenuous times, when the\r\nspirit of adventure was less curbed, and initial difficulties were\r\nless deadened by convention, cases of concealment of sex were far more\r\nnumerous and more easily prolonged. In an age of foreign wars, many\r\nexisting barriers against success in this respect were removed by\r\ngeneral laxity of social conditions. Perhaps I may be allowed to say at\r\nthe outset that, for my own part, my mind refuses absolutely to accept\r\nthat which is generally alleged in each case, that the male comrades\r\nof women concealing their proper sex were, all through, ignorant of\r\nthe true facts. Human nature is opposed to such a supposition, and\r\nexperience bears out the shrewdness of nature. On occasions, or even\r\nfor a time, it is possible to make such successful concealments. But\r\nwhen we are told that a woman has gone through a whole campaign or a\r\nprolonged voyage in all the overcrowded intimacy of tent and bivouac\r\nor of cabin and forecastle, without such a secret being suspected or\r\ndiscovered, the narrator makes an overlarge draft on human credulity.\r\nThat such comrades, and many of them, forbore to give away the\r\nsecret, no matter how it had come into their possession, we may well\r\nbelieve. Comradeship is a strong factor in such matters, and it has\r\nits own loyalty, which is never stronger than when the various persons\r\ninterested are held together by the knowledge of a common danger.\r\nBut even to this there is a contra; the whole spirit of romance, even\r\nwhen it binds man to woman and woman to man, stands side by side with\r\nlove, affection, passion--call it what you will--which opportunity can\r\nfan into flame. Never more so than in the strenuous days of fighting,\r\nwhen day and night are full of varying fears--when the mad turmoil of\r\nworking hours and loneliness of the night forge new fetters for the\r\nbinding together of the sexes.\r\n\r\nIn real life, when a man or a woman tries to escape from capture or\r\nthe fear of it in the guise of the opposite sex, it is a never-ending\r\nstruggle to sustain the rôle successfully. If this is so, when the\r\nwhole of the energies of mind and body are devoted in singleness\r\nof purpose to the task, how then can the imposture be successfully\r\nprolonged when the mind is eternally occupied with the pressing\r\nthings of the passing moments? There must infallibly be moments of\r\nself-betrayal; and there is sufficient curiosity in the average person\r\nto insure that the opportunities of such moments are not lost. Be this\r\nas it may, we must in the first instance stick to matters of fact; the\r\nrecord is our sheet-anchor. After all, when we learn of a case where\r\nan imposture of the kind has been successfully carried out, it is time\r\nenough to argue with convincing perspicacity that it should not have\r\nbeen possible.\r\n\r\nAs to record, there are quite sufficient cases to convince any reader\r\nas to the fact that, allowing for all possible error and wastage,\r\nthere have been a sufficient number undetected at the time of their\r\nhappening, and only made known by after-confession and by the force of\r\nulterior circumstances. Whatever opinion we may form of the women who\r\ncarried out the venture, there is neither occasion nor need to doubt\r\nthe fact they were so carried out. The consideration of a few cases\r\nculled from the records of this class of successful imposture will\r\nmake this plain. It would be useless, if not impossible, to make full\r\nlists of the names of women who have passed themselves off as men in\r\nthe fighting world--soldiers and sailors, with side interests such as\r\npiracy, duelling, highway robbery, etc. Amongst the female soldiers\r\nare the names of Christian Davis (known as Mother Ross), Hannah Snell,\r\nPhœbe Hessel. Amongst the sailors those of Mary Talbot, Ann Mills,\r\nHannah Whitney, Charles Waddell. In the ranks of the pirates are Mary\r\nReid and Ann Bonney. In many of these cases are underlying romances, as\r\nof women making search for lost or absconding husbands, or of lovers\r\nmaking endeavours to regain the lost paradise of life together.\r\n\r\nIf there were nothing else in these little histories, their perusal in\r\ndetail would well repay attention as affording proof of the boundless\r\ndevotion of woman’s love. No matter how badly the man may have treated\r\nthe woman, no matter how heartlessly or badly he may have behaved\r\ntowards her, her affection was proof against all. Indeed it makes\r\none believe that there is some subtle self-sustaining, self-ennobling\r\nquality in womanhood which her initial self-surrender makes a constant\r\nforce towards good. Even a nature which took new strength from the\r\nturmoil of battle, from the harrowing suspense of perpetual vigil, from\r\nthe strain of physical weakness bravely borne, from pain and want and\r\nhunger, instead of hardening into obstinate indifference, seems to have\r\nsoftened as to sentiment, and been made gentle as to memory, as though\r\nthe sense of wrong had been purged by the forces of affliction. All\r\nthis, though the stress of campaigning may have blunted some of the\r\nconventional susceptibility of womanhood. For the after life of some of\r\nthese warlike heroines showed that they had lost none of the love of\r\nadmiration which marks their sex, none of their satisfaction in posing\r\nas characters other than their own. Several of them found pleasure in a\r\nnew excitement different from that of battle, in the art of the stage.\r\nWhenever any of them made any effort to settle down in life after their\r\nexcitement in the life of the camp or the sea, such did so at some\r\nplace, and in some way congenial to herself and consistent with the\r\nlife which she was leaving.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. HANNAH SNELL\r\n\r\nHannah Snell is a good instance of how the life of a woman who was not\r\nby nature averse from adventure was moulded by chance in the direction\r\nwhich suited her individuality. Of course, liking for a militant life,\r\nwhether in conventional or exceptional form, presupposes a natural\r\nboldness of spirit, resolution, and physical hardihood--all of which\r\nthis woman possessed in an eminent degree.\r\n\r\nShe was born at Worcester in 1723, one of the family of a hosier who\r\nhad three sons and six daughters. In 1740, when her father and mother\r\nwere dead, she went to live at Wapping with a sister who had married a\r\nship carpenter named Gray. There she married a Dutch sailor, who before\r\nher baby was born, had squandered such little property as her father\r\nhad left her, and then deserted her. She went back to her sister, in\r\nwhose house the baby died. In 1743, she made up her mind to search for\r\nher husband. To this end she put on man’s clothes and a man’s name\r\n(that of her brother-in-law) and enlisted in General Guise’s regiment.\r\nAt Carlisle, whither the regiment was sent she learned something of\r\na soldier’s duties. In doing so she was selected by her sergeant, a\r\nman called Davis, to help him in carrying out a criminal love affair.\r\nIn order to be able to warn the girl she pretended acquiescence. In\r\nrevenge the sergeant reported her for an alleged neglect of some\r\nduty for which according to the barbarous system of the time she was\r\nsentenced to 600 lashes; of these she had actually received 500 when\r\non the intervention of some of the officers the remaining hundred\r\nwere foregone. After this, fearing further aggression on the part of\r\nthe revengeful petty officer she deserted. She walked all the way to\r\nPortsmouth--a journey which occupied a whole month--where she again\r\nenlisted as a marine in Fraser’s regiment, which was shortly ordered\r\non foreign service to the East Indies. There was a storm on the way\r\nout, during which she worked manfully at the pumps. When the ship had\r\npassed Gibraltar there was another bad storm in which she was wrecked.\r\nHannah Snell found her way to Madeira and thence to the Cape of Good\r\nHope. Her ship joined in the taking of Arcacopong on the Coromandel\r\nCoast; in which action Hannah fought so bravely that she was praised\r\nby her officers. Later on she assisted in the siege of Pondicherry\r\nwhich lasted nearly three months before it had to be abandoned. In the\r\nfinal attempt she served on picket duty and had to ford, under fire,\r\na river breast high. During the struggle she received six bullets\r\nin the right leg, five in the left leg, and one in the abdomen. Her\r\nfear was not of death but discovery of her sex through the last-named\r\nwound. By the friendly aid of a black woman, however, she avoided this\r\ndanger. She managed to extract the bullet herself, with her finger and\r\nthumb, and the wound made a good cure. This wound caused her a delay\r\nof some weeks during which her ship had to leave for Bombay and was\r\ndelayed five weeks by a leak. Poor Hannah was again unfortunate in her\r\nofficers; one of them to whom she had refused to sing had her put in\r\nirons and given a dozen lashes. In 1749 she went to Lisbon, where she\r\nlearned by chance that her husband had met at Genoa the death penalty\r\nby drowning, for a murder which he had committed. Discovery of her sex\r\nand her identity would have been doubly dangerous now; but happily she\r\nwas able to conceal her alarm and so escaped detection. She got back to\r\nLondon through Spithead and once more found shelter in the house of her\r\nsister who at once recognised her in spite of her disguise. Her fine\r\nsinging voice, which had already caused her to be flogged, now stood\r\nher in good stead. She applied for and obtained an engagement at the\r\nRoyalty theatre, Wellclose square; and appeared with success as _Bill\r\nBobstay_ a sailor and _Firelock_ a soldier. She remained on the stage\r\nfor some months, always wearing male dress. The government of the day\r\ngave her, on account of the hardships she had endured, a pension of £20\r\nper annum. Later on she took a public-house at Wapping. The sign of her\r\nhostelry became noted. On one side of it was painted in effigy _The\r\nBritish Tar_ and on the other _The Valiant Marine_, and underneath _The\r\nWidow in masquerade_, or the _Female Warrior_.\r\n\r\nAs Hannah appeared during her adventurous career as both soldier and\r\nsailor she affords, in herself, an illustrious example of female\r\ncourage as well as female duplicity in both of the services.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. LA MAUPIN\r\n\r\nThe majority of the readers of the English-speaking race who enjoy\r\nThéophile Gautier’s fascinating romance _Mademoiselle de Maupin_ are\r\nnot aware that the heroine was a real person. The novelist has of\r\ncourse made such alterations as are required to translate crude fact\r\ninto more elegant fiction, and to obliterate so far as can be done the\r\ncriminal or partly-criminal aspect of the lady’s venturous career. But\r\nsuch is one of the chief duties of an artist in fiction. Though he\r\nmay be an historian, in a sense, he is not limited to the occasional\r\nbareness of truth. His object is not that his work shall be true but\r\nrather what the French call _vraisemblable_. In narrative, as in most\r\narts, crudeness is rather a fault than a virtue, so that the writer\r\nwho looks for excellence in his work has without losing force, to fill\r\nup the blanks left by the necessary excision of fact by subtleties of\r\nthought and graces of description, so that the fulness or rotundity\r\nof the natural curves shall always be maintained. In truth the story\r\nof _La Maupin_ is so laden with passages of excitement and interest\r\nthat any writer on the subject has only to make an agreeable choice\r\nof episodes sufficiently dramatic, and consistent with each other,\r\nto form a cohesive narrative. Such a work has in it possibilities of\r\ngreat success--if only the author has the genius of a Théophile Gautier\r\nto set it forth. The real difficulty which such an one would have\r\nto contend against would be to remove the sordidness, the reckless\r\npassion, the unscrupulousness, the criminal intent which lies behind\r\nsuch a character.\r\n\r\nThe Mademoiselle de Maupin of real life was a singer at the Opera in\r\nParis at the end of the seventeenth century. She was the daughter\r\nof a man of somewhat humble extraction engaged in secretarial work\r\nwith the Count d’Armagnac; and whilst only a girl married a man named\r\nMaupin employed in the province. With him she had lived only a few\r\nmonths when she ran away with a maitre d’armes (_anglicè_, a fencing\r\nmaster) named Serane. If this individual had no other good quality in\r\nmatters human or divine, he was at least a good teacher of the sword.\r\nHis professional arts were used in the service of his inamorata, who\r\nbecame herself an excellent swordsman even in an age when swordsmanship\r\nhad an important place in social life. It may have been the sexual\r\nequality implied by the name which gave the young woman the idea, but\r\nthenceforth she became a man in appearance;--in reality, in so far as\r\nsuch a metamorphosis can be accomplished by courage, recklessness,\r\nhardihood, unscrupulousness, and a willing obedience to all the ideas\r\nwhich passion and sensuality can originate and a greed of notoriety\r\ncarry into execution.\r\n\r\nIn a professional tour from Paris to Marseilles, in which she as an\r\nactress took the part of a man, she gained the affections of the\r\nflighty daughter of a rich merchant of Marseilles; and, as a man, ran\r\naway with her. Being pursued, they sought refuge in a convent--a place\r\nwhich at that age it was manifestly easier to get into than to get\r\nout of. Here the two remained for a few days, during which, by the\r\naid of histrionic and other arts, the actress obviated the necessary\r\nsuspicions of her foolish companion and kept danger away. All the while\r\nLa Maupin was conscious that an irate and rich father was in hot search\r\nfor his missing daughter, and she knew that any talk about the venture\r\nwould infallibly lose her the girl’s fortune, besides getting herself\r\nwithin the grip of the law. So she decided on a bold scheme of escape\r\nfrom the convent, whereby she might obliterate her tracks. A nun of\r\nthe convent had died and her body was awaiting burial. In the night La\r\nMaupin exchanged the body of the dead nun for the living one of her own\r\nvictim. Having thus got her companion out of the convent, she set the\r\nbuilding on fire to cover up everything, and escaped in secret to a\r\nneighbouring village, taking with her by force the girl, who naturally\r\nenough was disillusioned and began to have scruples as to the wisdom\r\nof her conduct. In the village they remained hidden for a few weeks,\r\nduring which time the repentance of the poor girl became a fixed\r\nquantity. An attempt, well supported, was made to arrest the ostensible\r\nman; but this was foiled by the female swordsman who killed one of the\r\nwould-be captors and dangerously wounded two others. The girl, however,\r\nmade good her escape; secretly she fled from her deceiver and reached\r\nher parents in safety. But the hue and cry was out after La Maupin,\r\nwhose identity was now known. She was pursued, captured, and placed\r\nin gaol to await trial. The law was strong and inexorable; the erring\r\nwoman who had thus outraged so many conventions was condemned to be\r\nburned alive.\r\n\r\nBut abstract law and the executive are quite different things--at least\r\nthey were in France at the close of the seventeenth century: as indeed\r\nthey are occasionally in other countries and at varying times. La\r\nMaupin, being a woman and a clever one, procured sufficient influence\r\nto have the execution postponed, and so had the full punishment\r\ndelayed, if not entirely avoided. More than this, she managed to get\r\nback to Paris and so to begin her noxious career all over again. Of\r\ncourse she had strong help from her popularity. She was a favourite at\r\nthe opera, and the class which patronises and supports this kind of\r\nartistic effort is a rich and powerful one, which governments do not\r\ncare to displease by the refusal of such a small favour as making the\r\nlaw hold its hand with regard to an erring favourite.\r\n\r\nBut La Maupin’s truculent tendencies were not to be restrained. In\r\nParis in 1695 whilst she was one of the audience at a theatre she took\r\numbrage at some act or speech of one of the comedians playing in the\r\npiece, and leaving her seat went round to the stage and caned him in\r\nthe presence of the audience. The actor, M. Dumenil, an accomplished\r\nand favourite performer but a man of peaceful disposition, submitted\r\nto the affront and took no action in the matter. La Maupin, however,\r\nsuffered, through herself, the penalty of her conduct. She had\r\nentered on a course of violence which became a habit. For some years\r\nshe flourished and exercised all the tyrannies of her own sex and\r\nin addition those habitual to men which came from expert use of the\r\nsword. Thus she went attired as a man to a ball given by a Prince of\r\nthe blood. In that garb she treated a fellow-guest, a woman, with\r\nindecency; and she was challenged by three different men--each of\r\nwhom, when the consequent fight came on, she ran through the body,\r\nafter which she returned to the ball. Shortly afterwards she fought\r\nand wounded a man, M. de Servan, who had affronted a woman. For these\r\nescapades she was again pardoned. She then went to Brussels where she\r\nlived under the protection of Count Albert of Bavaria, the Elector.\r\nWith him she remained until the quarrel, inevitable in such a life,\r\ncame. After much bickering he agreed to her demand of a settlement,\r\nbut in order to show his anger by affronting her he sent the large\r\namount of his involuntary bequest by the servile hand of the husband\r\nof his mistress, Countess d’Arcos, who had supplanted her, with a\r\ncurt message that she must leave Brussels at once. The bearer of such\r\na message to such a woman as La Maupin had probably reckoned on an\r\nunfriendly reception; but he evidently underestimated her anger. Not\r\ncontented with flinging at his head the large _douceur_ of which he was\r\nthe bearer, she expressed in her direct way her unfavourable opinion,\r\nof him, of his master, and of the message which he had carried for\r\nthe latter. She ended her tirade by kicking him downstairs, with the\r\njustification for her form of physical violence that she would not\r\nsully her sword with his blood.\r\n\r\nFrom Brussels she went to Spain as _femme de chambre_ to the Countess\r\nMarino but returned to Paris in 1704. Once more she took up her work as\r\nan opera singer; or rather she tried to take it up, but she had lost\r\nher vogue, and the public would have none of her. As a matter of fact,\r\nshe was only just above thirty years of age, which should under normal\r\ncircumstances be the beginning of a woman’s prime. But the life she\r\nhad been leading since her early girlhood was not one which made for\r\ntrue happiness or for physical health; she was prematurely old, and her\r\nartistic powers were worn out.\r\n\r\nStill, her pluck, and the obstinacy on which it was grafted, remained.\r\nFor a whole year she maintained a never-failing struggle for her old\r\nsupremacy, but without avail. Seeing that all was lost, she left the\r\nstage and returned to her husband who, realising that she was rich,\r\nmanaged to reconcile whatever shreds of honour he had to her infamous\r\nrecord. The Church, too, accepted her--and her riches--within its\r\nsheltering portals. By the aid of a tolerant priest she got absolution,\r\nand two years after her retirement from the opera she died in a convent\r\nin all the odour of sanctity.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. MARY EAST\r\n\r\nThe story of Mary East is a pitiful one, and gives a picture of\r\nthe civil life of the eighteenth century which cannot be lightly\r\nforgotten. The condition of things has so changed that already we\r\nalmost need a new terminology in order that we may understand as our\r\ngreat-grandfathers did. Take for instance the following sentence and\r\ntry individually how many points in it there are, the full meaning of\r\nwhich we are unable to understand:\r\n\r\n“A young fellow courted one Mary East, and for him she conceived the\r\ngreatest liking; but he going upon the highway, was tried for a robbery\r\nand cast, but was afterwards transported.”\r\n\r\nThe above was written by an accomplished scholar, a Doctor of Divinity,\r\nrector of an English parish. At the time of its writing, 1825, every\r\nword of it was entirely comprehensible. If a reader of that time could\r\nsee it translated into modern phraseology he would be almost as much\r\nsurprised as we are when we look back upon an age holding possibilities\r\nno longer imaginable.\r\n\r\n“Going upon the highway” was in Mary East’s time and a hundred years\r\nlater a euphemism for becoming a highway robber; “cast” meant condemned\r\nto death; “transported” meant exiled to a far distant place where one\r\nwas guarded, and escape from which was punishable with death. Moreover\r\nrobbery was at this time a capital offence.\r\n\r\nIn 1736, when Mary East was sixteen, life was especially hard on women.\r\nFew honest occupations were open to them, and they were subject to all\r\nthe hardships consequent on a system in which physical weakness was\r\nhandicapped to a frightful extent. When this poor girl was bereft of\r\nher natural hope of a settlement in life she determined, as the least\r\nunattractive form of living open to her, to remain single. About the\r\nsame time a friend of hers arrived at the same resolution but by a\r\ndifferent road, her course being guided thereto by having “met with\r\nmany crosses in love.” The two girls determined to join forces; and\r\non consulting as to ways and means decided that the likeliest way to\r\navoid suspicion was to live together under the guise of man and wife.\r\nThe toss of a coin decided their respective rôles, the “breeches part”\r\nas it is called in the argot of the theatre, falling to East. The\r\ncombined resources of the girls totalled some thirty pounds sterling,\r\nso after buying masculine garb for Mary they set out to find a place\r\nwhere they were unknown and so might settle down in peace. They found\r\nthe sort of place they sought in the neighbourhood of Epping Forest\r\nwhere, there being a little public-house vacant, Mary--now under the\r\nname of James How--became the tenant. For some time they lived in peace\r\nat Epping, with the exception of a quarrel forced by a young gentleman\r\non the alleged James How in which the latter was wounded in the hand.\r\nIt must have been a very one-sided affair, for when the injured “man”\r\ntook action he was awarded £500 damages--a large sum in those days\r\nand for such a cause. With this increase to their capital the two\r\nwomen moved to Limehouse on the east side of London where they took at\r\nLimehouse-hole a more important public-house. This they managed in so\r\nexcellent a manner that they won the respect of their neighbours and\r\nthrove exceedingly.\r\n\r\nAfter a time they moved from Limehouse to Poplar where they bought\r\nanother house and added to their little estate by the purchase of other\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nPeace, hard work, and prosperity marked their life thence-forward, till\r\nfourteen years had passed since the beginning of their joint venture.\r\n\r\nPeace and prosperity are, however, but feeble guardians to weakness.\r\nNay, rather are they incentive to evil doing. For all these years\r\nthe two young women had conducted themselves with such rectitude,\r\nand observed so much discretion, that even envy could not assail\r\nthem through the web of good repute which they had woven round their\r\nmasquerade. Alone they lived, keeping neither female servant nor male\r\nassistant. They were scrupulously honest in their many commercial\r\ndealings and, absolutely punctual in their agreements and obligations.\r\nJames How took a part in the public life of his locality, filling in\r\nturn every parish office except those of Constable and Churchwarden.\r\nFrom the former he was excused on account of the injury to his hand\r\nfrom which he had never completely recovered. Regarding the other his\r\ntime had not yet come, but he was named for Churchwarden in the year\r\nfollowing to that in which a bolt fell from the blue, 1730. It came\r\nin this wise: A woman whose name of coverture was Bently, and who was\r\nnow resident in Poplar, had known the alleged James How in the days\r\nwhen they were both young. Her own present circumstances were poor\r\nand she looked on the prosperity of her old acquaintance as a means\r\nto her own betterment. It was but another instance of the old crime\r\nof “blackmail.” She sent to the former Mary East for a loan of £10,\r\nintimating that if the latter did not send it she would make known the\r\nsecret of her sex. The poor panic-stricken woman foolishly complied\r\nwith the demand, thus forcing herself deeper into the mire of the other\r\nwoman’s unscrupulousness. The forced loan, together with Bently’s\r\nfears for her own misdeed procured immunity for some fifteen years from\r\nfurther aggression. At the end of that time, however, under the renewed\r\npressure of need Bently repeated her demand. “James How” had not the\r\nsum by her, but she sent £5--another link in the chain of her thraldom.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on there was no more peace for poor Mary East. Her\r\ncompanion of nearly thirty-five years died and she, having a secret\r\nto guard and no assistance being possible, was more helpless than\r\never and more than ever under the merciless yoke of the blackmailer.\r\nMrs. Bently had a fair idea of how to play her own despicable game.\r\nAs her victim’s fear was her own stock-in-trade she supplemented the\r\nsense of fear which she knew to exist by a conspiracy strengthened by\r\nall sorts of schemes to support its seeming _bona fides_. She took\r\nin two male accomplices and, thus enforced, began operations. Her\r\nconfederates called on James How, one armed with a constable’s staff,\r\nthe other appearing as one of the “thief-takers” of the gang of the\r\nnotorious magistrate, Fielding--an evil product of an evil time. Having\r\nconfronted How they told him that they had come by order of Mr. Justice\r\nFielding to arrest him for the commission of a robbery over forty years\r\nbefore, alleging that they were aware of his being a woman. Mary East,\r\nthough quite innocent of any such offence but acutely conscious of her\r\nimposture of manhood, in her dismay sought the aid of a friend called\r\nWilliams who understood and helped her. He went to the magistrates\r\nof the district and then to Sir John Fielding to make inquiries and\r\nclaim protection. During his absence the two villains took Mary East\r\nfrom her house and by threats secured from her a draft on Williams\r\nfor £100. With this in hand they released their victim who was even\r\nmore anxious than themselves not to let the matter have greater\r\npublicity than it had already obtained. However, Justice demanded a\r\nfurther investigation, and one of the men being captured--the other\r\nhad escaped--was tried, and being found guilty, was sentenced to\r\nimprisonment for four years together with four appearances in the\r\npillory.\r\n\r\nAltogether Mary East and her companion had lived together as husband\r\nand wife for nearly thirty-five years, during which time they had\r\nhonestly earned, and by self-denial saved, over four thousand pounds\r\nsterling and won the good opinion of all with whom they had come in\r\ncontact. They were never known to cook a joint of meat for their own\r\nuse, to employ any help, or to entertain private friends in their\r\nhouse. They were cautious, careful, and discreet in every way and\r\nseemed to live their lives in exceeding blamelessness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. HOAXES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a class of imposture which must be kept apart from others\r\nof its kind, or at least ear-marked in such wise that there can be\r\nno confusion of ideas regarding it. This includes all sorts of acts\r\nwhich, though often attended with something of the same result as other\r\nefforts to mislead, are yet distinguished from them by intention. They\r\nhave--whatever may be their results--a jocular and humorous intention.\r\nSuch performances are called hoaxes. These, though amusing to their\r\nperpetrators and to certain sportive persons, and though generally\r\ncausing a due amount of pain and loss to those on whom they are\r\ninflicted, usually escape the condign and swift punishment which they\r\ndeserve. It is generally held that humour, like charity, covereth a\r\nmultitude of sins. So be it. We are all grateful for a laugh no matter\r\nwho may suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. TWO LONDON HOAXES\r\n\r\nNot many years ago, in one of the popular dairy-refreshment shops in\r\nHolborn, the prim manageress and her white-capped waitresses were just\r\ncommencing their day’s work when a couple of sturdy green-aproned men\r\nswooped down on the place from a large pantechnicon van, and to the\r\namazement of the young ladies commenced to clear the shop.\r\n\r\n“There you are Bill. Hand up them chairs, and look slippy.”\r\n\r\n“Right o’, mate.”\r\n\r\n“Good gracious me, what are you men doing?” shrieked the alarmed\r\nmanageress.\r\n\r\n“Doing, miss, doing? Why moving the furniture. This is the lot ain’t\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, no; there must be some mistake. You must have come to the\r\nwrong place.”\r\n\r\n“Mistake, wrong place? No miss. ’Ere, look where’s that letter?” And\r\nJack placed a begrimed document before the lady.\r\n\r\nThe letter seemed right enough. It read beautifully, a plain direction\r\nto clear the shop and remove the stuff elsewhere; it only lacked the\r\nofficial heading of the company. But the joint inspection was rudely\r\nbroken in upon by the arrival of a couple of the knights of the brush\r\nwho had come “to do the chimbley, maam”; and ere they could be disposed\r\nof vans of coals began to draw up, more pantechnicons, more sweeps,\r\nloads of furniture, butchers with prime joints, plump birds from the\r\npoulterers, fish of every conceivable kind, noisy green-grocer boys,\r\nstaggering under huge loads of vegetables; florists “to decorate,”\r\ngasfitters, carpenters “to take down the counter, miss”; others “to put\r\nit up.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPandemonium is quiet compared with that shop. The poor manageress was\r\nin tears, deafened with the exasperated, swearing representatives\r\nof, apparently, all the tradesmen for miles around. The thing had\r\nbeen well done. No sooner had the provision merchants worked clear\r\nand the streams of vans, waggons and carts been backed away to the\r\naccompaniment of much lurid language, than ladies began to arrive with\r\nboxes of mysterious long garments which, they assured the indignant\r\nlady in charge, they were instructed were urgently needed for an event\r\nthey referred to as “interesting.” There was no monotony, for fast and\r\nfurious--very furious sometimes--came other maidens laden with more\r\nboxes and still more boxes, filled with costumes, bonnets, and other\r\ncreations dear to the feminine mind. Then came servants “in answer to\r\nyour advertisement, madam.” They flocked in from all directions, north,\r\nsouth, east and west. Never was seen such a concourse of servants:\r\ndignified housekeepers, housemaids, parlourmaids, and every other\r\nsort of maid, seemed to be making for that unfortunate manageress.\r\nSleek-looking butlers popped in, as uniformed nurses popped out.\r\nWindow-cleaners had to be torn from the windows they insisted they\r\nhad got orders to clean; carpet beaters sought carpets which did not\r\nexist. Never had mortal--aye and immortal--requirements been thought\r\nout with more thoughtful care. From the needs of the unborn baby, to\r\nthe “poor departed one,” whom melancholy gentlemen in seedy black came\r\nto measure, all were remembered, and the man for whose especial benefit\r\npresumably were intended beautiful wreaths, crosses, harps, etc., which\r\nkept constantly arriving. Throughout that live-long day to the “dewy\r\neve” beloved of the poet the game went merrily on.\r\n\r\nAs a hoax the thing was worked for all it was worth. Not only had\r\nshoals of letters evidently been sent out, but advertisements, too, had\r\nbeen freely distributed among the press. Needless to say that, despite\r\nthe closest investigations, its author or authors, discreetly silent,\r\nremained unknown.\r\n\r\nThe joke was not new by any means. Well nigh a century before\r\nmischief-loving Theodore Hook had stirred all London by a similar\r\nprank--the famous Berners Street Hoax. In those days Berners Street was\r\na quiet thoroughfare inhabited by fairly well-to-do families. Indeed\r\nit was this very sedate quietness which drew upon it Hook’s unwelcome\r\nattention. Fixing on one of the houses, which happened to be adorned\r\nwith a brass plate, he made a wager with a brother wag that he would\r\ncause that particular house to become the talk of the town: and he\r\ncertainly did--for not only the town, but all England shrieked with\r\nlaughter when the result of his little manœuvre became known.\r\n\r\nOne morning, soon after breakfast, waggons laden with coals began\r\nto draw up before the house with the brass plate, No. 54. These\r\nwere quickly succeeded with tradespeople by the dozen with various\r\ncommodities. These in turn were followed by van loads of furniture;\r\nfollowed by a hearse with a coffin and a number of mourning coaches.\r\nSoon the street became choked: for, what with the goods dumped down\r\nas near as possible to the house--pianos, organs, and cart loads of\r\nfurniture of all descriptions, the anxious tradesmen, and the laughing\r\nmob of people quickly attracted to the scene, confusion reigned\r\nsupreme. About this time the Lord Mayor and other notabilities began\r\nto arrive in their carriages. His Lordship’s stay was short. He was\r\ndriven to Marlborough Street police office where he informed the\r\nmagistrate that he had received a note purporting to come from Mrs.\r\nT., the victimised widow resident at No. 54, saying she was confined\r\nto her room and begging his lordship to do her the favour of calling\r\non her on important business. Meanwhile, the trouble in Berners\r\nStreet was growing serious, and officers belonging to the Marlborough\r\nStreet office were at once sent to keep order. For a time even they\r\nwere helpless. Never was such a strange meeting: barbers with wigs;\r\nmantlemakers with band-boxes; opticians with their various articles of\r\ntrade. Presently there arrived a couple of fashionable physicians, an\r\naccoucheur, and a dentist. There were clockmakers, carpet manufacturers\r\nand wine merchants, all loaded with specimens of their trade; brewers\r\nwith barrels of ale, curiosity dealers with sundry knickknacks;\r\ncartloads of potatoes; books, prints, jewellery, feathers and furbelows\r\nof all kinds; ices and jellies; conjuring tricks; never was such a\r\nconglomeration. Then, about five o’clock servants of all kinds began\r\nto troop in to apply for situations. For a time the police officers\r\nwere powerless. Vehicles were jammed and interlocked; the exasperated\r\ndrivers were swearing, and the disappointed tradesmen were maddened\r\nby the malicious fun of the crowd who were enjoying the joke. Some\r\nof the vans were overturned and many of the tradesmens’ goods came\r\nto grief; while some of the casks of ale became the prey of the\r\ndelighted spectators. All through the day and late into the night this\r\nextraordinary state of things continued, to the dismay and terror of\r\nthe poor lady and the other inmates of the house with the brass plate.\r\n\r\nTheodore Hook had taken precautions to secure a good seat for the\r\nperformance, having taken furnished-apartments just opposite the house\r\nof his victim, where he posted himself with one or two companions to\r\nenjoy the scene. Hook’s connection with the mad joke was, fortunately\r\nfor him, not known until long afterwards; it seems he had devoted three\r\nor four whole days to writing the letters, all couched in ladylike\r\nstyle. In the end the novelist seems to have been rather frightened at\r\nthe result of his little joke, for he made a speedy departure to the\r\ncountry; and there is no doubt that, had he been publicly known as its\r\nauthor, he would have fared badly.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. THE CAT HOAX\r\n\r\nOne very amusing variation of the countless imitations, which the\r\nsuccess of this trick gave rise to, was the “cat hoax” at Chester,\r\nin August, 1815. It was at the time when it had been determined to\r\nsend Napoleon to St. Helena. One morning, a number of hand bills were\r\ndistributed in and around Chester, stating that, owing to the island of\r\nSt. Helena being invested with rats, the government required a number\r\nof cats for deportation. Sixteen shillings were offered for “every\r\nathletic full-grown tom cat, ten shillings for every adult female\r\npuss, and a half-crown for every thriving kitten that could swill\r\nmilk, pursue a ball of thread, or fasten its young fangs in a dying\r\nmouse.” An address was given at which the cats were to be delivered;\r\nbut it proved to be an empty house. The advertisement resulted in the\r\nvictimisation of hundreds of people. Men, women, and children streamed\r\ninto the city from miles around laden with cats of every description.\r\nSome hundreds were brought in, and the scene before the door of the\r\nempty house is said to have baffled description. When the hoax was\r\ndiscovered many of the cats were liberated; the following morning no\r\nless than five hundred dead cats were counted floating down the river\r\nDee.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. THE MILITARY REVIEW\r\n\r\nPractical jokes of this nature have more than once led to serious\r\nresults. In the summer of 1812 a report was extensively circulated that\r\na grand military review was to be held on the 19th of June. Booths were\r\nerected and as many as twenty thousand people assembled, despite the\r\nefforts of the authorities who, when they learned what was happening,\r\nposted men in the several roads leading to the heath to warn the people\r\nthat they had been hoaxed. But their efforts were useless. The rumour\r\nwas believed and the contradiction ignored; vehicles, horsemen and\r\npedestrians pushed on to their destination. When, however, the day wore\r\non without any appearance of the promised military pageant, the crowd\r\ngrew angry and then broke out in acts of violence. The heath was set on\r\nfire. Messengers were sent off express to London, and a detachment of\r\nthe guards had to be marched down to quell the mob. In the disorder one\r\npoor woman was thrown out of a chaise and picked up in an unconscious\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. THE TOLL-GATE\r\n\r\nMany distinguished actors have been very fond of playing practical\r\njokes and perpetrating hoaxes. Young, the tragedian, was one day\r\ndriving in a gig with a friend on the outskirts of London. Pulling\r\nup at a turn-pike gate he noticed the name of the toll-collector\r\nwritten up over the door. Calling to him the woman, the wife of that\r\nfunctionary, who appeared to be in charge of the gate, he politely\r\ntold her that he particularly wished to see Mr. ----, naming the\r\ntoll-collector, on a matter of importance. Impressed by Young’s manner,\r\nshe promptly sent for her husband, who was working in a neighbouring\r\nfield. Hastily washing himself and putting on a clean coat he presented\r\nhimself. The actor gravely said: “I paid for a ticket at the last gate,\r\nand was told that it would free me through this one. As I wish to be\r\nscrupulously exact, will you kindly tell me whether such is the case?”\r\n“Why of course it is?” “Can I then pass through without paying?” The\r\ntoll-collector’s reply and his vituperation as the travellers passed on\r\nhad better, perhaps, be left to the imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\nE. THE MARRIAGE HOAX\r\n\r\nHoaxes are sometimes malicious, and often cruel, as the following\r\ninstance will show: A young couple were about to be married in\r\nBirmingham when those officiating--it was a Jewish wedding--were\r\nstartled by the delivery of a telegram from London with the message:\r\n“Stop marriage at once. His wife and children have arrived in London\r\nand will come on to Birmingham.” The bride fainted and the bridegroom\r\nwas frantically perturbed at thus summarily being provided with a\r\nwife and family. But it was useless; the unhappy man had to make the\r\nbest of his way through an exasperated crowd full of sympathy for the\r\nwronged girl. Inquiry, however, showed her friends that the whole thing\r\nwas a hoax--possibly worked by some revengeful rival of the man whose\r\nhappiness had been so unexpectedly deferred.\r\n\r\n\r\nF. BURIED TREASURE\r\n\r\nMost people have heard of the “Spanish Treasure swindle” and, though\r\nless elaborate than the original, a variation of it practised on a\r\nFrench merchant was rather “cute.” One morning he received an anonymous\r\ncommunication advising him that a box of treasure was buried in his\r\ngarden the exact position of which would be pointed out to him, if\r\nhe agreed to divide the spoil. He rose at once to the bait, met his\r\ngenerous informant, and before long the pair were merrily at work\r\nwith pickaxe and shovel. Sure enough before long their exertions\r\nwere awarded by the unearthing of a box full of silver coins. The\r\nhoard proved to consist of sixteen hundred five-franc pieces; and\r\nthe delighted merchant, after carefully counting them out into two\r\npiles, offered one lot to his partner as his share. That worthy, after\r\ncontemplating the heap for a minute or two, observed that it would\r\nbe rather a heavy load to carry to the railway station, and said he\r\nwould prefer, if it could be managed, to have the amount in gold or\r\nnotes. “Certainly, certainly!” was the reply. The two men walked up to\r\nthe house and the business was settled to their mutual satisfaction.\r\nTwenty-four hours later, the merchant took a very different view of\r\nthe transaction; for examination discovered there was not one genuine\r\nfive-franc piece among the whole lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nG. DEAN SWIFT’S HOAX\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful hoaxes ever perpetrated was one for which\r\nSwift was responsible. He caused a broad-sheet to be printed and\r\ncirculated which purported to be the “last dying speech” of one\r\nElliston, a street robber, in which the condemned thief was made to\r\nsay: “Now as I am a dying man, I have done something which may be of\r\nuse to the public. I have left with an honest man--the only honest man\r\nI was ever acquainted with--the names of all my wicked brethren, the\r\nplaces of their abode, with a short account of the chief crimes they\r\nhave committed, in many of which I have been their accomplice, and\r\nheard the rest from their own mouths. I have likewise set down names of\r\nthose we call our setters, of the wicked houses we frequent, and all\r\nof those who receive and buy our stolen goods. I have solemnly charged\r\nthis honest man, and have received his promise upon oath, that whenever\r\nhe hears of any rogue to be tried for robbery or housebreaking, he\r\nwill look into his list, and if he finds the name there of the thief\r\nconcerned, to send the whole paper to the Government. Of this I here\r\ngive my companions fair and public warning, and hope they will take\r\nit.” So successful, we are told, was the Dean’s ruse that, for many\r\nyears afterwards, street robberies were almost unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nH. HOAXED BURGLARS\r\n\r\nThe above ingenious device recalls another occasion when some gentlemen\r\nwho made burglary their profession, and who had been paying a midnight\r\nvisit to the house of a Hull tradesman were sadly “sold.” They found\r\nthe cash-box lying handy, and, to their delight, weighty; so heavy\r\nindeed that they did not stay to help themselves to anything further.\r\nNext morning the cash-box was found not far from the shop and its\r\ncontents in an ash-pit close by. After all the trouble they had taken,\r\nto say nothing of the risks they had run, the burglars found their\r\nprize consisted only of a lump of lead, and that their intended victim\r\nhad been too artful for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. BOGUS SAUSAGES\r\n\r\nAs an example of how a dishonest penny may be turned the following\r\nincident would be hard to beat.\r\n\r\nTwo weary porters at the King’s Cross terminus of the Great Northern\r\nRailway were thinking about going home, when a breathless,\r\nsimple-looking countryman rushed up to them with anxious enquiries for\r\na certain train. It had gone. He was crushed. “Whatever was he to do?\r\nHe had been sent up from Cambridge with a big hamper of those sausages\r\nfor which the University town is celebrated--a very special order. Was\r\nthere no other train?” “No.” The poor fellow seemed overwhelmed. “As\r\nit is too late to find another market,” he complained, “the whole lot\r\nwill be lost.” Then a happy thought seemed to strike him as more of\r\nthe railway men gathered round, and he inquired ingratiatingly, “Would\r\nyou care to buy the sausages; if you would, you could have them for\r\nfourpence a pound? If I keep them, they will probably go bad before\r\nI can dispose of them.” The idea took--“Real Cambridge Sausages” at\r\nfourpence a pound was not to be sneezed at. The dainties, neatly packed\r\nin pounds, went like the proverbial hot cakes. Shouldering the empty\r\nbasket, and bidding his customers a kindly goodnight, the yokel set\r\noff to find a humble lodging for the night. Grateful smiles greeted\r\nthe purchasers when they got home. Frying pans were got out and the\r\nsausages were popped in, and never was such a sizzling heard in the\r\nrailway houses--or rather never should such a sizzling have been heard.\r\nBut somehow they didn’t sizzle. “They are uncommon dry; seem to have\r\nno fat in ’em,” said the puzzled cook. They were dry, very dry, for\r\ncloser investigation showed that the “prime Cambridge” were nothing\r\nbut skins stuffed with dry bread! The railway staff of King’s Cross\r\nwere long anxious to meet that simple countryman from Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. THE MOON HOAX\r\n\r\nOne of the most stupendous hoaxes, and one foisted on the credulity of\r\nthe public with the most complete success, was the famous Moon Hoax\r\nwhich was published in the pages of the New York _Sun_ in 1835. It\r\npurported to be an account of the great astronomical discoveries of\r\nSir John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope, through the medium of a\r\nmighty telescope, a single lens of which weighed nearly seven tons.\r\nIt was stated to be reproduced from the Supplement to the Edinburgh\r\n_Journal of Science_, though as a matter of fact, the _Journal_ had\r\nthen been defunct some years. In graphic language, and with a wealth\r\nof picturesque detail, the wonders of the Moon as revealed to the\r\ngreat astronomer and his assistants were set forth. A great inland\r\nsea was observed, and “fairer shores never angel coasted on a tour\r\nof pleasure.” The beach was “of brilliant white sand, girt with wild\r\ncastellated rocks apparently of green marble, varied at chasms,\r\noccurring every two hundred feet, with grotesque blocks of chalk or\r\ngypsum, and feathered and festooned at the summit with the clustering\r\nfoliage of unknown trees.” There were hills of amethysts “of a diluted\r\nclaret colour”; mountains fringed with virgin gold; herds of brown\r\nquadrupeds resembling diminutive bison fitted with a sort of “hairy\r\nveil” to protect their eyes from the extremes of light and darkness;\r\nstrange monsters--a combination of unicorn and goat; pelicans, cranes,\r\nstrange amphibious creatures, and a remarkable biped beaver. The last\r\nwas said to resemble the beaver of the earth excepting that it had\r\nno tail and walked only upon its two feet. It carried its young in\r\nits arms like a human-being, and its huts were constructed better and\r\nhigher than those of many savage tribes; and, from the smoke, there was\r\nno doubt it was acquainted with the use of fire. Another remarkable\r\nanimal observed, was described as having an amazingly long neck, a head\r\nlike a sheep, bearing two spiral horns, a body like a deer, but with\r\nits fore-legs disproportionately long as also its tail which was very\r\nbushy and of a snowy whiteness, curling high over its rump and hanging\r\ntwo or three feet by its side.\r\n\r\nBut even these marvels fade into insignificance compared with the\r\ndiscovery of the lunarian men “four feet in height, covered, except\r\non the face, with short and glossy copper-coloured hair, with wings\r\ncomposed of a thin membrane.” “In general symmetry they were infinitely\r\nsuperior to the orang-outang”--which statement could hardly have\r\nbeen regarded as complimentary; and, though described as “doubtless\r\ninnocent and happy creatures,” the praise was rather discounted by\r\nthe mention that some of their amusements would “but ill comport with\r\nour terrestrial notions of decorum.” In the “Vale of the Triads,”\r\nwith beautiful temples built of polished sapphire, a superior race of\r\nthe punariant were found, “eminently happy and even polite,” eating\r\ngourds and red cucumbers; and further afield yet another race of the\r\nvespertilio-homo, or man-bat, were seen through the wonderful telescope\r\nof “infinitely greater personal beauty ... scarcely less lovely than\r\nthe general representation of angels.”\r\n\r\nSuch were a few of the marvels told of in the Moon story; and, though\r\none may laugh at them as they stand, shorn of their clever verbiage and\r\nquasi-scientific detail, at the time of publication they were seriously\r\naccepted, for the popular mind, even among the educated classes, was\r\nthen imbued with the fanciful anticipators of vast lunar discoveries\r\nheralded in the astronomical writings of Thomas Dick, LL.D., of the\r\nUnion College of New York. Scarcely anything could have been brought\r\nforward too extravagant for the general credulity on the subject then\r\nprevailing; and this well-timed satire, “out-heroding Herod” in its\r\nimaginative creations, supplied to satiety the morbid appetite for\r\nscientific wonders then raging. By its plausible display of scientific\r\nerudition it successfully duped, with few exceptions, the whole\r\ncivilised world.\r\n\r\nAt the time, the hoax was very generally attributed to a French\r\nastronomer, M. Nicollet, a legitimist who fled to America in 1830. He\r\nwas said to have written it with the twofold object of raising the\r\nwind, and of “taking in” Arago, a rival astronomer. But its real author\r\nwas subsequently found to be Richard Adams Locke, who declared that\r\nhis original intention was to satirise the extravagances of Dick’s\r\nwritings, and to make certain suggestions which he had some diffidence\r\nin putting forward seriously. Whatever may have been his object, the\r\nwork, as a hit, was unrivalled. For months the press of America and\r\nEurope teemed with the subject; the account was printed and published\r\nin many languages and superbly illustrated. But, finally, Sir John\r\nHerschel’s signed denial gave the mad story its quietus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE CHEVALIER D’EON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the range of doubtful personalities there is hardly any one whom\r\nconvention has treated worse than it has the individual known in his\r\ntime--and after--as The Chevalier d’Eon. For about a hundred and fifty\r\nyears he has been written of--and spoken of for the first half century\r\nof that time--simply as a man who masqueraded in woman’s clothes. There\r\nseems to be just sufficient truth in this to save certain writers\r\non the subject from the charge of deliberate lying--a record which,\r\neven if it is to be posthumous, no man of integrity aims at; but it\r\nis abundantly evident that the rumour, which in time became a charge,\r\nwas originally set on foot deliberately by his political enemies, who\r\ntreated him and his memory without either consideration or even the\r\nelements of honourable truth. To begin with, here are the facts of his\r\nlong life.\r\n\r\nCharles-Genevieve--Louis-Auguste-Andre--Timothée d’Eon de Beaumont was\r\nborn in 1728 in Tonnerre in Yonne, a department of France in the old\r\nprovince of Burgundy. His father, Louis d’Eon, was a parliamentary\r\nbarrister. As a youth he was so apt in his studies at the Collège\r\nMazarin that he received by special privilege his degree of Doctor in\r\nCanon and Civil Law before the age appointed for the conferring of such\r\nhonour, and was then enrolled in the list of parliamentary barristers\r\nin Paris. At first he had been uncertain which department of life he\r\nshould undertake. He swayed on one side towards the church, on the\r\nother towards the world of letters and _beaux-arts_. He was by habit\r\nan athlete, and was so good a swordsman that later on he had no rival\r\nin fencing except the Chevalier de Saint-George. In his twenty-fifth\r\nyear he published two remarkable books. One was on the political\r\nadministration of ancient and modern people, and the other on Phases\r\nof Finance in France at different times. (The latter was afterwards\r\npublished in German at Berlin in 1774, and so impressed the then King\r\nof Prussia that he gave orders that its ideas were to be carried into\r\npractical effect.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHEVALIER D’EON]\r\n\r\nIn 1755 the Prince de Conti, to whose notice the Chevalier had been\r\nbrought by the above books, asked the king (Louis XV) to send him to\r\nRussia on a secret mission with the Chevalier Douglas; and from that\r\ntime till the king’s death in 1774 he was his trusted, loyal agent\r\nand correspondent. D’Eon’s special mission was to bring the courts\r\nof France and Russia closer than had been their wont, and also to\r\nobtain for the Prince de Conti, who was seeking the Dukedom of Finland\r\nand the Kingship of Poland, the favour of the Empress Elizabeth--a\r\ndifficult task, which had already cost M. de Valcroissant a spell\r\nof imprisonment. In order to accomplish his mission, d’Eon disguised\r\nhimself as a woman, and in this guise he was able to creep into the\r\ngood graces of the Empress. He became her “reader” and was thus enabled\r\nto prepare her for the reception of the secret purposes of his king.\r\nIn the following year he returned to France whence he was immediately\r\nsent again to St. Petersburg with the title of Secretary of Embassy.\r\nBut this time he went in his man’s clothes and as the brother of the\r\npretended female reader. By this time he had been made a lieutenant of\r\ndragoons. He came in spite of the Russian Chancellor Bestuchéf, who\r\nsaw in the young soldier-diplomat “_un subject dangereux et capable de\r\nboulverser l’empire_.” This time his real mission was to destroy in\r\nthe mind of the Empress faith in Bestuchéf, who was trying to hold the\r\nRussian army inactive and so deprive France of the advantages of the\r\nTreaty of Versailles. This he did so well that he was in a position to\r\nprove to the Empress that her chancellor had betrayed her interests.\r\nBestuchéf was arrested and his post conferred on Count Woronzow,\r\nwhose attitude was altogether favourable to France. The gratitude of\r\nKing Louis was shewn by his making d’Eon a captain of dragoons and\r\nconferring on him a pension of 2400 livres; he was also made censor of\r\nhistory and literature. D’Eon threw himself with his accustomed zeal\r\ninto the service of the army and distinguished himself by his courage\r\nin the battles of Hoecht; of Ultrop, where he was wounded; of Eimbech\r\nwhere he put the Scotch to flight; and of Osterkirk, where at the head\r\nof 80 dragoons and 20 hussars he overthrew a battalion of the enemy.\r\n\r\nNo better conventional proof of the accepted idea of d’Eon’s military\r\nworthiness can be given than the frequency and importance of the\r\noccasions on which he was honoured by the carrying of despatches. He\r\nbrought news of his successful negotiations for the peace of Versailles\r\nfrom Vienna in 1757. He was also sent with the Ratification of the\r\nTreaty. He carried the despatches of the great victory of the troops of\r\nMaria Theresa, forestalling the Austrian courier by a day and a half,\r\nalthough he had a broken leg.\r\n\r\nWhen next sent to Russia, d’Eon was sent as minister plenipotentiary,\r\nan office which he held up to 1762 when to the regret of the Empress\r\nhe was recalled. When he was leaving, Woronzow, the successor of\r\nBestuchéf, said to him, “I am sorry you are going, although your first\r\njourney with Chevalier Douglas cost my sovereign 250,000 men and more\r\nthan 5,000,000 roubles.” D’Eon answered: “Your excellency ought to\r\nbe happy that your sovereign and his minister have gained more glory\r\nand reputation than any others in the world.” On his return d’Eon\r\nwas appointed to the regiment d’Autchamp and gazetted as adjutant to\r\nMarshal de Broglie. Then he was sent to Russia for the fourth time\r\nas minister plenipotentiary in place of Baron de Breuteuil. But Peter\r\nIII was dethroned, so the out-going Ambassador remained in Russia,\r\nand d’Eon went to England as secretary to the Embassy of the Duke de\r\nNivernais in 1762.\r\n\r\nAfter the Peace of 1763 d’Eon was chosen by the King of England to\r\ncarry the despatches. He received for this office the Star of St. Louis\r\nfrom the breast of the king, who on giving it said it was for the\r\nbravery which he had displayed as a soldier, and for the intelligence\r\nwhich he had shown in the negotiations between London and St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nAt this time all went well with him. But his good fortune was changed\r\nby the bitter intrigues of his enemies. He was devoted to the king,\r\nbut had, almost as a direct consequence, the enmity of the courtesans\r\nwho surrounded him and wished for the opportunity of plucking him\r\nat their leisure. He had an astonishing knowledge on all matters of\r\nfinance, and apprised the king privately of secret matters which his\r\nministers tried to hide from him. The Court had wind of that direct\r\ncorrespondence with his majesty and therewith things were so managed\r\nthat the diplomatist got into trouble. Madame de Pompadour surprised\r\nthe direct correspondence between the king and d’Eon, with the result\r\nthat the latter was persecuted by the jealous courtiers who intrigued,\r\nuntil in 1765 he was replaced at the Embassy of London by the Count de\r\nGuerchy and he himself became the mark for all sorts of vexations and\r\npersecutions. His deadly enemy, the Count de Guerchy, tried to have\r\nhim poisoned, but the attempt failed. D’Eon took legal steps to punish\r\nthe attempt; but every form of pressure was used to keep the case out\r\nof Court. An attempt was made to get the Attorney General to enter a\r\n_nolle prosequi_; but he refused to lend himself to the scheme, and\r\nsent the matter to the Court of King’s Bench. There, despite all the\r\ndifficulties of furthering such a charge against any one so protected\r\nas an ambassador, it was declared on trial that the accused was guilty\r\nof the crime charged against him. De Guerchy accordingly had to return\r\nto France; but d’Eon remained in England, though without employment. To\r\nconsole him King Louis gave him in 1766 a pension of 12,000 livres, and\r\nassured him that though he was ostensibly exiled this was done to cover\r\nup the protection extended to him. D’Eon, according to the report of\r\nthe time, was offered a bribe of 1,200,000 livres, to give up certain\r\nstate papers then in his custody; but to his honour he refused. Be the\r\nstory as it may, d’Eon up to the time of the death of Louis (1774)\r\ncontinued to be in London the real representative of France, though\r\nwithout any formal appointment.\r\n\r\nDuring this time one of the means employed with success by his enemies\r\nto injure the reputation of d’Eon, was to point out that he had passed\r\nhimself as a woman; the disguise he wore on his first visit to Russia.\r\nHis clean shaven face, his personal niceties, the correctness of his\r\nlife, all came to the aid of that supposition. In England bets were\r\nmade and sporting companies formed for the purpose of verifying his\r\nsex. Designs were framed for the purpose of carrying him off in order\r\nto settle the vexed question by a personal examination. Some of the\r\nefforts he had to repel by violence. In 1770 and in 1772 his friends\r\ntried to arrange that he should be allowed to return to France; but he\r\nrefused all offers as the Ministers insisted on making it a condition\r\nof his return that he should wear feminine apparel. After the accession\r\nof Louis XVI he obtained leave to return, free from the embarrassing\r\nrestraint hitherto demanded. As he was overwhelmed with debts he placed\r\nas a guarantee in the hands of Lord Ferrers an iron casket containing\r\nimportant French state papers. The minister sent Beaumarcheus to redeem\r\nthem, and in 1771 the Chevalier returned to France. He presented\r\nhimself at Versailles in his full uniform of a captain of dragoons. The\r\nQueen (Marie Antoinette) however, wished to see him presented in female\r\ndress; so the Minister implored him to meet her wishes. He consented;\r\nand thenceforward not only wore women’s clothes but called himself “La\r\nChevalière d’Eon.” In a letter addressed by him to Madame de Staël\r\nduring the French revolution he spoke of himself as “citizeness of the\r\nNew Republic of France, and of the old Republic of Literature.” On 2nd\r\nSeptember, 1777 he wrote to the Count de Maurepas, “Although I detest\r\nchanges of costume, yet they are hard at work at Mademoiselle Bertin’s\r\non my future and doleful dress, which however I shall cut in pieces at\r\nthe first sound of the cannon shots.” As a matter of fact when war with\r\nEngland became imminent he demanded to be allowed to take in the army\r\nthe position which he had won by bravery and as the price of honourable\r\nwounds. The only reply he got was his immurement for two months in the\r\nCastle of Dijon. In 1784 he returned to England, which he never again\r\nleft. In vain he appealed to the Convention and then to the First\r\nConsul to be allowed to place his sword at the service of his country;\r\nbut his prayer was not listened to. Used to the practice of the sword,\r\nhis circumstances being desperate, he then found in it a source of\r\nincome. He gave in public, assaults-at-arms with the Chevalier de\r\nSaint-George, one of the most notable fencers of his time. At length he\r\nwas given a small pension, £40, by George III, on which he subsisted\r\nduring the remainder of his life. He died 23rd May, 1810.\r\n\r\nIn very fact Chevalier d’Eon is historically a much injured man. His\r\nvocation was that of a secret-service agent of a nation surrounded with\r\nenemies, and to her advantage he used his rare powers of mind and body.\r\nHe was a very gallant soldier, who won distinction in the field and\r\nwas wounded several times; and in his endurance and his indifference\r\nto pain whilst carrying despatches of overwhelming importance he set\r\nan example that any soldier might follow with renown. As a statesman\r\nand diplomatist, and by the use of his faculties of inductive\r\nratiocination, he averted great dangers from his country. If there were\r\nnothing else to his credit he might well stand forth as a diplomatist\r\nwho had by his own exertions overthrown a dishonest Russian Chancellor\r\nand an unscrupulous French Ambassador. Of course, as he was an agent of\r\nsecret service, he had cognisance of much political and international\r\nscheming which he had at times to frustrate at the risk of all which he\r\nheld dear. But, considering the time he lived in, and the dangers which\r\nhe was always in the thick of, in a survey of his life the only thing\r\na reader can find fault with is his yielding to the base idea of the\r\nflighty-minded Marie Antoinette. What, to this irresponsible butterfly\r\nof fashion, was the honour of a brave soldier or the reputation of an\r\nacute diplomatist who had deserved well of his country. Of course to\r\nher any such foolery as that to which she condemned d’Eon was but the\r\nfancy of an idle moment. But then the fancies of queens at idle moments\r\nmay be altogether destructive to someone. That they may be destructive\r\nto themselves is shown in the record of the terrible atrocities of the\r\nRevolution which followed hard on the luxurious masquerades of Trianon\r\nand Versailles. Even to the Queen of France, the Chevalier d’Eon\r\nshould have been something of a guarded, if not an honoured, person. He\r\nwas altogether a “king’s man.” He had been for many years the trusted\r\nand loyal servant of more than one king; and from the king’s immediate\r\ncircle the proper consideration should have been shown.\r\n\r\nThere is something pitiful in the spectacle of this old gentleman of\r\nnearly eighty years of age, who had in his time done so much, being\r\ncompelled to earn a bare livelihood by the exploitation of the most\r\nsordid page in his history--a page turned more than half a century\r\nbefore, and then only turned at all in response to the call of public\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nIn his retirement d’Eon showed more of his real nature than had been\r\npossible to him in the strenuous days when he had to be always vigilant\r\nand ready at an instant’s notice to conceal his intentions--his very\r\nthoughts. Here he showed a sensitiveness with which even his friends\r\ndid not credit him. He had been so long silent as to matters of his\r\nown concern that they had begun to think he had lost the faculty not\r\nonly of making the thought known, but even of the thought itself. The\r\nfollowing paragraph from the London _Public Advertiser_ of Wednesday,\r\n16th November, 1774, shows more of the real man than may be found in\r\nany of his business letters or diplomatic reports:--\r\n\r\n“The Chevalier d’Eon with justice complains of our public prints; they\r\nare eternally sending him to France while he is in body and soul fixed\r\nin this country; they have lately confined him in the Bastille, when he\r\nfled to England as a country of liberty; and they lately made a Woman\r\nof him, when not one of his enemies dared to put his manhood to the\r\nproof. He makes no complaints of the English Ladies.”\r\n\r\nIn an issue of the same paper 9th November, of the same year, it is\r\nmentioned that the Rt. Hon. Lord Ferrars, Sir John Fielding, Messrs.\r\nAddington, Wright and other worthy magistrates and gentlemen and\r\ntheir ladies did the Chevalier d’Eon the honour to dine with him in\r\nBrewer St., Golden Square (common proof that the Chevalier d’Eon is\r\nnot confined in the Bastille). D’Eon was much too wily and too much\r\naccustomed to attack to allow diplomatic insinuations to pass unheeded.\r\nHe was now beginning to apply his garnered experience to his own\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nFrom the above extract of 16th November one can note how the allegation\r\nas to his sex was beginning to rankle in the soldier’s mind, and how\r\nan open threat of punishment is conveyed in diplomatic form. Indeed\r\nhe had reason to take umbrage at the insinuation. More than once had\r\nattempts been made to carry him off for the purpose of settling bets\r\nby a humiliating personal scrutiny. From something of the same cause\r\nhis friends on his death caused an autopsy to be made before several\r\nwitnesses of position and repute. Amongst these were several surgeons\r\nincluding Père Elisée, First Surgeon to Louis XVIII. The medical\r\ncertificate ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“Je certifie, par le présent, avoir inspecté le corps du chevalier\r\nd’Eon, en présénce de M. Adair, M. Wilson et du Père Elysée, et avoir\r\ntrouvé les organs masculins parfaitement formés.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. THE BISLEY BOY\r\n\r\n\r\nA. PROLEGOMENON\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth, the last of the House of Tudor, died unmarried. Since\r\nher death in 1603, there have been revolutions in England due to\r\nvarying causes, but all more or less disruptive of family memories.\r\nThe son of James I had his head cut off, and after the Commonwealth\r\nwhich followed, Charles I’s son James II, had to quit on the coming of\r\nWilliam III, by invitation. After William’s death without issue, Anne,\r\ndaughter of James II, reigned for a dozen years, and was succeeded\r\nby George I, descended through the female line from James I. His\r\ndescendants still sit on the throne of England.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO DESCENDANTS\r\n\r\nThe above facts are given not merely in the way of historical\r\nenlightenment but rather as a sort of apologetic prolegomenon to the\r\nethical consideration of the matter immediately before us. Had Queen\r\nElizabeth had any descendants, they need not have feared any discussion\r\nof her claims of descent. The issue of the legality of her mother’s\r\nmarriage had been tried exhaustively both before and after her own\r\nbirth, and she held the sceptre both by the will of her dead father\r\nand the consent of her dead half-sister who left no issue. But Queen\r\nElizabeth, whatever her origin, would have been a sufficient ancestor\r\nfor any King or any Dynasty. Still, had she left issue there might\r\nhave been lesser people, descendants, whose feelings in the matter of\r\npersonal and family pride would have required consideration; and no\r\nperson entering on an analysis of historical fact would have felt quite\r\nfree-handed in such an investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. THE QUEEN’S SECRET\r\n\r\nThere are quite sufficient indications throughout the early life of\r\nQueen Elizabeth that there was _some_ secret which she kept religiously\r\nguarded. Various historians of the time have referred to it, and now\r\nand again in a way which is enlightening.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the Protector Somerset in 1549, when the Princess\r\nElizabeth was 15, Sir Robert Tyrwhitt says:\r\n\r\n    “I do verily believe that there hath been some secret promise\r\n    between my Lady, Mistress Ashley, and the Cofferer” [Sir Thomas\r\n    Parry] “never to confess to death, and if it be so, it will never\r\n    be gotten of her, unless by the King’s Majesty or else by your\r\n    Grace.”\r\n\r\nIn his _Girlhood of Queen Elizabeth_ Mr. Frank A. Mumby writes of\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\n    “Elizabeth was as loyal to Parry as to Mrs. Ashley; she\r\n    reinstated him after a year’s interval, in his office as\r\n    Cofferer, and on her accession to the throne she appointed\r\n    him Controller of the royal household. She continued to confer\r\n    preferment upon both Parry and his daughter to the end of their\r\n    lives--“conduct,” remarks Miss Strickland, “which naturally\r\n    induces a suspicion that secrets of great moment had been\r\n    confided to him--secrets that probably would have touched not\r\n    only the maiden name of his royal Mistress, but placed her life\r\n    in jeopardy, and that he had preserved these inviolate. The same\r\n    may be supposed with respect to Mrs. Ashley, to whom Elizabeth\r\n    clung with unshaken tenacity through every storm.”\r\n\r\nMajor Martin Hume in his _Courtships of Queen Elizabeth_ says of the\r\nfavourable treatment of the Governess and the Cofferer:--\r\n\r\n    “The confessions of Ashley and Parry are bad enough; but they\r\n    probably kept back more than they told, for on Elizabeth’s\r\n    accession and for the rest of their lives, they were treated\r\n    with marked favour. Parry was knighted and made Treasurer of the\r\n    Household, and on Mrs. Ashley’s death in July 1565 the Queen\r\n    visited her in person and mourned her with great grief.”\r\n\r\nThe same writer says elsewhere in the book:\r\n\r\n    “Lady Harrington and Mrs. Ashley were, in fact, the only ladies\r\n    about the Queen who were absolutely in her confidence.”\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the Doge of Venice in 1556 Giovanni Michiel wrote:\r\n\r\n    “She” [Elizabeth] “I understand, having plainly said that she\r\n    will not marry, even were they to give her the King’s” [Philip of\r\n    Spain] “son” [Don Carlos, Philip’s son by his first wife] “or\r\n    find any other great prince, I again respectfully remind your\r\n    serenity to enjoin secrecy about this.”\r\n\r\nCount de Feria wrote in April, 1559:\r\n\r\n    “If my spies do not lie, which I believe they do not, for a\r\n    certain reason which they have recently given me, I understand\r\n    that she [Elizabeth] will not bear children.”\r\n\r\nAt this time Elizabeth was only 26 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe following extract is taken from Mr. Mumby’s _Girlhood of Queen\r\nElizabeth_ in which is given the translation taken from Leti’s _La Vie\r\nd’Elizabeth_. The letter is from Princess Elizabeth to Lord Admiral\r\nSeymour, 1548 (_apropos_ of his intentions regarding her):--\r\n\r\n    “It has also been said that I have only refused you because I\r\n    was thinking of some one else. I therefore entreat you, my lord,\r\n    to set your mind at rest on this subject, and to be persuaded by\r\n    this declaration that up to this time I have not the slightest\r\n    intention of being married, and, that if ever I should think of\r\n    it (_which I do not believe is possible_) you would be the first\r\n    to whom I should make known my resolution.”\r\n\r\n\r\nC. BISLEY\r\n\r\nThe place known to the great public as Bisley is quite other than that\r\nunder present consideration. Bisley, the ground for rifle competitions,\r\nis in Surrey, thoughtfully placed in juxtaposition to an eminent\r\ncemetery. It bears every indication of newness-so far as any locality\r\nof old earth can be new.\r\n\r\nBut the other is the original place of the name, possessing a\r\nrecorded history which goes back many hundreds of years. It is in\r\nGloucestershire high up on the eastern side of the Cotswold Hills at\r\ntheir southern end where they rise above the Little Avon which runs\r\ninto the embouchure of the Severn to the Bristol Channel. The trace of\r\nRoman occupation is all over that part of England. When the pioneers\r\nof that strenuous nation made their essay on Britain they came with\r\nthe intention of staying; and to-day their splendid roads remain\r\nunsurpassed--almost unsurpassable. In this part of the West Country\r\nthere are several of them, of which the chief are Irmin (or Ermine)\r\nStreet, running from Southampton through Cirencester and Gloucester\r\nto Caerleon, and Ikenild Street running from Cirencester, entering\r\nGloucestershire at Eastleach. I am particular about these roads as we\r\nmay require to notice them carefully. There is really but one Bisley in\r\nthis part of the country, but the name is spelled so variously that the\r\nsimple phonetic spelling might well serve for a nucleating principle.\r\nIn all sorts of papers, from Acts of Parliament and Royal Charters\r\ndown to local deeds of tenancy, it is thus varied--Bisleigh, Bistlegh,\r\nByselegh, Bussely. In this part of the Cotswolds “Over” is a common\r\npart of a name which was formerly used as a prefix. Such is not always\r\nat once apparent for the modern cartographer seems to prefer the modern\r\nword “upper” as the prefix. Attention is merely called to it here as\r\nlater on we shall have to consider it more carefully.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting spot in the whole district is the house\r\n“Overcourt,” which was once the manor-house of Bisley. It stands close\r\nto Bisley church from the grave-yard of which it is only separated by a\r\nwicket-gate. The title-deeds of this house, which is now in possession\r\nof the Gordon family show that it was a part of the dower of Queen\r\nElizabeth. But the world went by it, and little by little the estate\r\nof which it was a portion changed hands; so that now the house remains\r\nalmost as an entity. Naturally enough, the young Princess Elizabeth\r\nlived there for a time; and one can still see the room she occupied. A\r\nmedium-sized room with mullioned windows, having small diamond-shaped\r\npanes set in lead after the pattern of the Tudor period. A great beam\r\nof oak, not exactly “trued” with the adze but following the natural\r\ntrend of the wood, crosses the ceiling. The window looks out on a\r\nlittle walled-in garden, one of the flower beds of which is set in an\r\nantique stone receptacle of oblong shape which presents something of\r\nthe appearance of a stone coffin of the earlier ages. Of this more anon.\r\n\r\nWhether at the time of the birth of Elizabeth the mansion of Overcourt\r\nwas itself in the King’s possession is a little difficult to fathom,\r\nfor, in the Confession of Thomas Parry written in 1549 concerning\r\na period a little earlier, it is said: “And I told her” [Princess\r\nElizabeth] “further how he” [Lord Admiral Thomas Seymour] “would have\r\nhad her to have lands in Gloucestershire called Bisley as in parcel of\r\nexchange, and in Wales.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to its natural desirability in the way of hygiene and\r\naltitude there seems to have been a wish on the part of family advisers\r\nof those having estates in the vicinity of this place, to enlarge\r\ntheir possessions. This was wise enough, for in the disturbed state of\r\naffairs which ushered in the Tudor Dynasty, and the effects of which\r\nstill continued, it was of distinct benefit to have communities here\r\nand there large enough for self protection. This idea held with many\r\nof the families as well as individuals whose names are associated\r\nwith Bisley. Henry VIII himself, as over-lord with ownership derived\r\nfrom the Norman Conquest, had feudal claims on the de Bohuns who\r\nrepresented all the local possessions of the Dukedom of Gloucester and\r\nthe Earldoms of Essex Hereford and Northampton. Also the greedy eyes of\r\ncertain strong men and families who had hopes that time and influence\r\nalready existing, might later on bring them benefit, were fixed on this\r\ndesirable spot. Thomas Seymour, the unscrupulous brother of the future\r\nLord Protector, was high in influence in the early days of the Princess\r\nElizabeth, and even then must have had ambitious designs of marrying\r\nher. On the death of Henry VIII he had, when Lord Sudeley, married the\r\nking’s widow within a few months of her widowhood, and received a\r\ngrant of the royal possession at Bisley which, on his attainder, passed\r\non to Sir Anthony Kingston, who doubtless had already marked it down as\r\nan objective of his cupidity.\r\n\r\nThe “Hundred of Bisley” was one of the seven of Cirencester which of\r\nold were farmed by the Abbey of Tewksbury. Its position was so full\r\nof possibilities of future development as to justify the acquisitive\r\nspirit of those who desired it. In its bounds were what is now the\r\ntown of Stroud, as well as a whole line of mills which had in early\r\ndays great effect as they were workable by both wind and water power,\r\nboth of which were to be had in profusion. This little remote hamlet\r\nhad a progressive industry of its own in the shape of a manufacture of\r\nwoollen cloths. It also represented dyeing in scarlet and was the place\r\nof origin of Giles Gobelin, a famous dyer who gave his name to the\r\nGobelin tapestry.\r\n\r\nOne other thing must be distinctly borne in mind regarding Bisley in\r\nthe first half of the sixteenth century; it was comparatively easy of\r\naccess from London for those who wished to go there. A line drawn on\r\nthe map will show that on the way as _points d’appui_, were Oxford\r\nand Cirencester, both of which were surrounded with good roads as\r\nbecame their importance as centres. This line seems very short for its\r\nimportance. To-day the journey is that of a morning; and even in the\r\ntime of Henry VIII when horse traction was the only kind available,\r\nthe points were not very distant as to time of traverse. To Henry, who\r\ncommanded everything and had a myriad agents eager to display their\r\nenergy in his service, all was simple; and when he went a-hunting\r\nin the forests which made a network far around Berkeley Castle his\r\nobjective could be easily won between breakfast and supper. There was\r\nnot any difficulty therefore, and not too much personal strain, when he\r\nchose to visit his little daughter even though at the start one should\r\nbe at Nether Lypiat and the other at Greenwich or Hatfield or Eltham.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. THE TRADITION\r\n\r\n_The Tradition_ is that the little Princess Elizabeth, during her\r\nchildhood, was sent away with her governess for change of air to Bisley\r\nwhere the strong sweet air of the Cotswold Hills would brace her up.\r\nThe healthy qualities of the place were known to her father and many\r\nothers of those around her. Whilst she was at Overcourt, word was sent\r\nto her governess that the King was coming to see his little daughter;\r\nbut shortly before the time fixed, and whilst his arrival was expected\r\nat any hour, a frightful catastrophe happened. The child, who had been\r\nailing in a new way, developed acute fever, and before steps could be\r\ntaken even to arrange for her proper attendance and nursing, she died.\r\nThe governess feared to tell her father--Henry VIII had the sort of\r\ntemper which did not make for the happiness of those around him. In her\r\ndespair she, having hidden the body, rushed off to the village to try\r\nto find some other child whose body could be substituted for that of\r\nthe dead princess so that the evil moment of disclosure of the sad fact\r\nmight be delayed till after His Majesty’s departure. But the population\r\nwas small and no girl child of any kind was available. The distracted\r\nwoman then tried to find a living girl child who could be passed off\r\nfor the princess, whose body could be hidden away for the time.\r\n\r\nThroughout the little village and its surroundings was to be found no\r\ngirl child of an age reasonably suitable for the purpose required. More\r\nthan ever distracted, for time was flying by, she determined to take\r\nthe greater risk of a boy substitute--if a boy could be found. Happily\r\nfor the poor woman’s safety, for her very life now hung in the balance,\r\nthis venture was easy enough to begin. There _was_ a boy available,\r\nand just such a boy as would suit the special purpose for which he was\r\nrequired--a boy well known to the governess, for the little Princess\r\nhad taken a fancy to him and had lately been accustomed to play with\r\nhim. Moreover, he was a pretty boy as might have been expected from\r\nthe circumstance of the little Lady Elizabeth having chosen him as her\r\nplaymate. He was close at hand and available. So he was clothed in the\r\ndress of the dead child, they being of about equal stature; and when\r\nthe King’s fore-rider appeared the poor overwrought governess was able\r\nto breathe freely.\r\n\r\nThe visit passed off successfully. Henry suspected nothing; as the\r\nwhole thing had happened so swiftly, there had been no antecedent\r\nanxiety. Elizabeth had been brought up in such dread of her father that\r\nhe had not, at the rare intervals of his seeing her, been accustomed to\r\nany affectionate effusiveness on her part; and in his hurried visit he\r\nhad no time for baseless conjecture.\r\n\r\nThen came the natural nemesis of such a deception. As the dead could\r\nnot be brought back to life, and as the imperious monarch, who bore\r\nno thwarting of his wishes, was under the impression that he could\r\ncount on his younger daughter as a pawn in the great game of political\r\nchess which he had entered on so deeply, those who by now must have\r\nbeen in the secret did not and could not dare to make disclosure.\r\nMoreover the difficulties and dangers to one and all involved would\r\nof necessity grow with each day that passed. Willy nilly they must go\r\non. Fortunately for the safety of their heads circumstances favoured\r\nthem. The secret was, up to now, hidden in a remote village high up\r\non the side of the Cotswold hills. Steep declivities guarded it from\r\ncasual intrusion, and there was no trade beyond that occasional traffic\r\nnecessary for a small agricultural community. The whole country as far\r\nas the eye could see was either royal domain or individual property\r\nowned or held by persons attached to the dynasty by blood or interest.\r\n\r\nFacilities of intercommunication were few and slow; and above all\r\nuncertain and therefore not to be relied on.\r\n\r\nThis then was the beginning of the tradition which has existed locally\r\never since. In such districts change is slow, and what has been may\r\nwell be taken, unless there be something to the contrary, for what\r\nis. The isolation of the hamlet in the Cotswolds where the little\r\nprincess lived for a time--and is supposed to have died--is almost best\r\nexemplified by the fact that though the momentous secret has existed\r\nfor between three and four centuries, no whisper of it has reached the\r\ngreat world without its confines. Not though the original subject of it\r\nwas the very centre of the wildest and longest battle which has ever\r\ntaken place since the world began--polemical, dynastic, educational,\r\ninternational, commercial. Anyone living in any town in our own age,\r\nwhere advance and expansiveness are matters of degree, not of fact, may\r\nfind it hard to believe that any such story, nebulous though it may be,\r\ncould exist unknown and unrecorded outside a place so tiny that its\r\nmost important details will not be found even on the ordnance map of an\r\ninch to the mile. But a visit to Bisley will set aside any such doubts.\r\nThe place itself has hardly changed, in any measure to be apparent as\r\na change, in the three centuries and more. The same buildings stand as\r\nof yore; the same estate wall, though more picturesque with lichen, and\r\nwith individual stones corrugated by weather and dislocated by arboreal\r\ngrowths, speak of an epoch ending with the Tudor age. The doors of\r\nthe great tithe-barns which remain as souvenirs of extinct feudalism,\r\nstill yawn wide on their festered hinges. Nay, even the very trees show\r\namongst their ranks an extraordinary percentage of giants which have\r\nwithstood unimpaired all the changes that have been.\r\n\r\nLeaving busy and thriving Stroud, one climbs the long hill past Lipiat\r\nand emerges in the village, where time has suddenly ceased, and we\r\nfind ourselves in the age and the surroundings which saw the House of\r\nYork fade into the Tudor dynasty. Such a journey is almost a necessity\r\nfor a proper understanding of the story of the Bisley Boy, which has\r\nby the effluxion of time attained to almost the grace and strength\r\nof a legend. It is quite possible that though the place has stood\r\nstill, the tradition has not, for it is in the nature of intellectual\r\ngrowth to advance. One must not look on the Gloucestershire people\r\nas sleepy--sleepiness is no characteristic of that breezy upland;\r\nbut dreaming, whether its results be true or false, does not depend\r\non sleep. In cases like the present, sleep is not to be looked on as\r\na blood relation of death but rather as a preservative against the\r\nravages of time--like the mysterious slumber of King Arthur and others\r\nwho are destined for renewal.\r\n\r\nIt may be taken for granted that in course of time and under the\r\nprocess of purely oral communication, the story told in whispers lost\r\nnothing in the way of romance or credibility; that flaws or lacunæ\r\nwere made good by inquiry; and that recollections of overlooked or\r\nforgotten facts were recalled or even supplemented by facile invention.\r\nBut it may also be taken for granted that no statement devoid of a\r\nsolid foundation could become permanently accepted. There were too\r\nmany critics around, with memories unimpaired by overwork, to allow\r\nincorrect statements to pass unchallenged. There is always this in\r\ntradition, that the collective mind which rules in small communities is\r\na child’s mind, which must ever hold grimly on to fact. And that behind\r\nthe child’s mind is the child’s nature which most delights in the\r\nrecountal of what it knows, and is jealous of any addition to the story\r\nwhich is a part of its being.\r\n\r\nMajor Martin Hume writes in his _Courtships of Queen Elizabeth_:\r\n\r\n    “Elizabeth was only three when her mother’s fall removed her from\r\n    the line of the succession.... In 1542, however, the death of\r\n    James V of Scotland and the simultaneous birth of his daughter\r\n    Mary seemed to bring nearer Henry’s idea of a union between the\r\n    two crowns. He proposed to marry the baby Queen of Scots to his\r\n    infant son and at the same time he offered the hand of Elizabeth\r\n    (then nine) to a son of Arran--head of House of Hamilton, next\r\n    heir to the Scottish crown.... Mary and Elizabeth were restored\r\n    to their places in the line of succession.... In January 1547\r\n    Henry VIII died, leaving the succession to his two daughters\r\n    in tail after Edward VI and his heirs. Queen Catherine (Parr)\r\n    immediately married Sir Thomas Seymour, brother of Protector\r\n    Somerset and uncle of the little king (Edward VI). To them was\r\n    confided Princess Elizabeth then a girl of 14.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth was three in 1536. The story of the Bisley Boy dates probably\r\nto 1543-4. So that if the story have any foundation at all in fact,\r\nsigns of a complete change of identity in the person of Princess\r\nElizabeth must be looked for in the period of some seven or eight years\r\nwhich intervened.\r\n\r\n\r\nE. THE DIFFICULTY OF PROOF\r\n\r\nIn such a case as that before us the difficulty of proof is almost\r\ninsuperable. But fortunately we are dealing with a point not of law\r\nbut of history. Proof is not in the first instance required, but only\r\nsurmise, to be followed by an argument of probability. Such records as\r\nstill exist are all the proofs that can be adduced; and all we can do\r\nis to search for such records as still exist, without which we lack\r\nthe enlightenment that waits on discovery. In the meanwhile we can\r\ndeduce a just conclusion from such materials as we do possess. Failing\r\ncertitude, which is under the circumstances almost impossible, we only\r\narrive at probability; and with that until discovery of more reliable\r\nmaterial we must be content.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore sum up: first the difficulties of the task before us;\r\nthen the enlightenments. “Facts,” says one of the characters of Charles\r\nDickens, “bein’ stubborn and not easy drove,” are at least, so far as\r\nthey go, available. We are free to come to conclusions and to make\r\ncritical comments. Our risk is that if we err--on whichever side does\r\nnot matter--we reverse our position and become ourselves the objects of\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nOur main difficulties are two. First, that all from whom knowledge\r\nmight have been obtained are dead and their lips are closed; second,\r\nthat records are incomplete. This latter is the result of one of two\r\ncauses--natural decay or purposed obliteration. The tradition of the\r\nBisley Boy has several addenda due to time and thought. One of these is\r\nthat some of those concerned in the story disappeared from the scene.\r\n\r\nThe story runs that on Elizabeth’s accession or under circumstances\r\nantecedent to it all who were in the secret and still remained were\r\n“got rid of.” The phrase is a convenient one and not unknown in\r\nhistory. Fortunately those who _must_ have been in such a secret--if\r\nthere was one--were but few. If such a thing occurred in reality, four\r\npersons were necessarily involved in addition to Elizabeth herself:\r\n(1) Mrs. Ashley, (2) Thomas Parry, (3) the parent of the living child\r\nwho replaced the dead one; the fourth, being an unknown quantity,\r\nrepresents an idea rather than a person--a nucleated identity typical\r\nof family life with attendant difficulties of concealment. Of these\r\nfour--three real persons and an idea--three are accounted for, so far\r\nas the “got rid of” theory is concerned. Elizabeth never told; Thomas\r\nParry and Mrs. Ashley remained silent, in the full confidence of the\r\n(supposed) Princess who later was Queen. With regard to the last, the\r\nnucleated personality which includes the unknown parent possibly but\r\nnot of certainty, contemporary record is silent; and we can only regard\r\nhim or her as a mysterious entity available for conjecture in such\r\ncases of difficulty as may present themselves.\r\n\r\nWe must perforce, therefore, fall back on pure unadulterated\r\nprobability, based on such rags of fact as can be produced at our\r\ninquest. Our comfort--content being an impossibility--must lie in the\r\ngenerally-accepted aphorism; “Truth will prevail.” In real life it is\r\nnot always so; but it is a comforting belief and may remain _faut de\r\nmieux_.\r\n\r\nA grave cause of misleading is inexact translation--whether the fault\r\nbe in ignorance or intentional additions to or substractions from\r\ntext referred to. A case in point is afforded by the letter already\r\nreferred to from Leti’s _La Vie d’Elizabeth_. In the portion quoted\r\nElizabeth mentioned her intention of not marrying: “I have not the\r\nslightest intention of being married, and ... if ever I should think\r\nof it (_which I do not believe is possible_).” Now in Mr. Mumby’s book\r\nthe quotation is made from Leti’s _La Vie d’Elizabeth_ which is the\r\ntranslation into French from the original Italian, the passage marked\r\nabove in italics is simply: “ce que je ne crois pas.” The addition of\r\nthe words “is possible” gives what is under the circumstances quite\r\na different meaning to the earliest record we have concerning the\r\nvery point we are investigating. When I began this investigation, I\r\nlooked on the passage--neither Mumby, remember, nor even Leti, but\r\nwhat professed to be the _ipsissima verba_ of Elizabeth herself--and\r\nI was entirely misled until I had made comparison for myself--_Quis\r\ncustodiet ipsos custodes?_ The addition of the two words, which seems\r\nat first glance merely to emphasise an expression of opinion, changes\r\nthe meaning of the writer to a belief so strong that the recital of it\r\ngives it the weight of intention. Under ordinary circumstances this\r\nwould not matter much; but as we have to consider it in the light of\r\na man defending his head against danger, and in a case where absolute\r\ncircumspection is a necessary condition of safety so that intention\r\nbecomes a paramount force, exactness of expression is all-important.\r\n\r\nThe only way to arrive at probability is to begin with fact. Such is\r\na base for even credulity or its opposite, and if it is our wish or\r\nintention to be just there need be no straining on either one side or\r\nthe other. In the case of the Bisley Boy the points to be considered\r\nare:\r\n\r\n1. The time at which the change was or could be affected.\r\n\r\n2. The risk of discovery, (a) at first, (b) afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to consider these separately for manifest reasons.\r\nThe first belongs to the region of Danger; the second to the region\r\nof Difficulty, with the headsman’s axe glittering ominously in the\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\n\r\nF. THE TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The time at which the change was or could have been effected._\r\n\r\nFor several valid reasons I have come to the conclusion that the\r\ncrucial period by which the Bisley story must be tested is the year\r\nending with July 1544. No other time either earlier or later would, so\r\nfar as we know, have fulfilled the necessary conditions.\r\n\r\nFirst of all the question of sex has to be considered; and it is herein\r\nthat, lacking suitable and full opportunity, discovery of such an\r\nimposture must have been at once detected--certainly had it commenced\r\nat an early age. In babyhood the whole of the discipline of child-life\r\nbegins. The ordinary cleanliness of life has to be taught, and to this\r\nend there is no portion of the infantile body which is not subject to\r\nat least occasional inspection. This disciplinary inspection lasts\r\nby force of habit until another stage on the journey towards puberty\r\nhas been reached. Commercial use in America fixes stages of incipient\r\nwomanhood--by dry goods’ advertisement--as “children’s, misses’ and\r\ngirls’ clothing,” and the illustration will sufficiently serve. It\r\nseems at first glance an almost unnecessary intrusion into purely\r\ndomestic life; but the present is just one of those cases where the\r\nexperience of women is not only useful but necessary. In a question\r\nof identity of sex the nursemaid and the washerwoman play useful\r\nparts in the witness box. Regarding Elizabeth’s childhood no question\r\nneed ever or can ever arise. For at least the first ten years of her\r\nlife, a woman’s sex _need_ not be known outside the nursery and the\r\nsick room; but then this is the very time when her attendants have\r\ndirect and ample knowledge. Moreover in the case of the child of Queen\r\nAnne (Boleyn) there was every reason why the sex should have been\r\nunreservedly known. Henry VIII divorced Katherine of Aragon and married\r\nAnne in the hope of having legitimate male issue to sit on the throne\r\nof England. Later, when both Katherine and Anne had failed to satisfy\r\nhim as to male issue, he divorced Anne and married Jane Seymour for\r\nthe same purpose. In the interval either his views had enlarged or\r\nhis patience had extended; for, when Jane’s life hung in the balance,\r\nowing to an operation which the surgeons considered necessary, and the\r\nhusband was consulted as to which life they should, in case of needful\r\nchoice, try to save, his reply was peculiar--though, taken in the light\r\nof historical perspective, not at variance with his dominating idea.\r\nGregorio Leti thus describes the incident (the quotation is made from\r\nthe translation of the Italian into French and published in Amsterdam\r\nin 1694):--\r\n\r\n    “Quand les médécins demandèrent au Roi qui l’on sauverait de\r\n    la mère ou de l’enfant, il répondit, qu’il auroit extremement\r\n    souhait de pouvoir sauver la mère et l’enfant, mais que cel\r\n    n’étant possible, il vouloit que l’on sauvat l’enfant plutôt que\r\n    la mère parce qu’il trouveroit assez d’autres femmes.”\r\n\r\nIt had become a monomania with Henry that he should be father of a\r\nlawful son; and when the child of his second union was expected, he\r\nso took the consummation of his wishes for granted that those in\r\nattendance on his wife were actually afraid to tell him the truth. It\r\nwould have been fortune and social honour to whosoever should bear\r\nhim the glad tidings. We may be sure then that news so welcome would\r\nnever have been perverted by those who had so much to gain. As it was,\r\nthe “lady-mistress”--as she called herself--of the little Princess,\r\nMrs. (afterwards Lady) Bryan, wrote in her letter to Lord Cromwell in\r\n1536--Elizabeth being then in her third year:--\r\n\r\n    “She is as toward a child and as gentle of conditions, as ever I\r\n    knew any in my life.”\r\n\r\nThe writer could have had no ignorance as to the sex of the child, for\r\nin the same letter she gives Cromwell a list of her wants in the way\r\nof clothing; which list is of the most intimate kind, including gown,\r\nkirtle, petticoat, “no manner of linen nor smocks,” kerchiefs, rails,\r\nbody stitchets, handkerchiefs, sleeves, mufflers, biggens. As in the\r\nsame letter it is mentioned that the women attending the child were\r\nunder the rule of Lady Bryan--an accomplished nurse who had brought up\r\nPrincess Mary and had been “governess to the children his Grace have\r\nhad ever since”--it can be easily understood she was well acquainted\r\nwith even the smallest detail of the royal nursery. Had the trouble of\r\nthe lady-mistress been with regard to superabundance of underclothing,\r\none might have understood ignorance on the part of the responsible\r\ncontroller; but in the plentiful lack of almost every garment necessary\r\nfor the child’s wear by day or by night there could be no question as\r\nto her ostensible sex at this age.\r\n\r\nThence on, there were experienced and devoted persons round the little\r\nPrincess, whose value in her father’s eyes was largely enhanced since\r\nhe had secured, for the time, her legitimacy by an Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nAfter Elizabeth had been legitimised, she became one of the pieces in\r\nthe gigantic game of chess on which Henry had embarked. Despite the\r\nfact that the son for whom he had craved was now a boy of six, it was\r\nonly wise to consider and be prepared for whatever might happen in case\r\nPrince Edward should not live, and if, in such a case, Mary should die\r\nwithout issue. The case was one of amazing complexity, and as the time\r\nwore on the religious question became structurally involved. England\r\nhad declared in no uncertain voice in favour of Protestantism, and the\r\nwhole forces of Rome were arrayed against her. Mary was altogether in\r\nfavour of the religion of her injured mother, and behind her stood the\r\npower of Catholicism which, even in that unscrupulous age, was well\r\nahead in the race of unscrupulousness. And as Elizabeth stood next\r\nto the young Prince Edward in the forces of Reformation, on her was\r\nfocussed much of the suspicion of polemic intrigue. The papacy was all\r\npowerful in matters of secret inquiry. Indeed in such an inquest its\r\npowers were unique, for unscrupulous spies were everywhere--even, it\r\nwas alleged, in the confessional. How then could such a secret as the\r\nsex of a little girl of not a dozen years of age, who was constantly\r\nsurrounded by women necessarily conversant with every detail of her\r\nlife, be kept from all who wished to solve it. In such a state of\r\naffairs suspicion was equivalent to discovery. And discovery meant ruin\r\nto all concerned, death to abettors of the fraud, woe and destruction\r\nto England and a general upheaval of the fundamental ideas of\r\nChristendom. It may, I presume, be taken for granted without flaw or\r\nmitigation of any kind that up to July, 1543, the “Princess Elizabeth”\r\nwas what she appeared to be--a girl.\r\n\r\nAt the time of her first letter to the new Queen, Catherine (Parr), she\r\nwas just a trifle under ten years of age and a well-grown child, quick,\r\nclever, rather precocious, and well grounded in the learning of her\r\ntime. The exact date of this letter is not given by Leti--of which more\r\nanon--but it must have been somewhere between July 12 and 31, 1543.\r\nHenry VIII married Catherine Parr on 12 July, and in her letter of 1543\r\nElizabeth calls Catherine “your Majesty.” In her letter of 31 July,\r\n1544 she writes to the same correspondent:\r\n\r\n    “... has deprived me for a whole year of your most illustrious\r\n    presence.”\r\n\r\nThe whereabouts of Elizabeth during this last year appears to be the\r\ncentre of the mystery; and if any letter or proof is ever found of\r\nElizabeth’s being anywhere but in her own house of Overcourt in Bisley\r\nParish, it will go far to settle the vexed question now brought before\r\nthe world for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The opportunity_\r\n\r\nThe year 1542 was a busy time for Henry VIII. He had on hand, either\r\npending or going on, two momentous wars, one with Scotland the other\r\nwith France. The causes of either of these were too complicated for\r\nmention here; suffice it to say that they were chiefly dynastic and\r\npolemic. In addition he was busy with matrimonial matters, chiefly\r\nkilling off his fifth wife Catherine Howard, and casting eyes on the\r\nnewmade widow of Lord Latimer. In 1543 he married the lady, as his\r\nsixth wife. She herself can hardly be said to have lacked matrimonial\r\nexperience, as this was her third union. Her first venture was with\r\nthe elderly Lord Borough, who, like Lord Latimer, left her wealthy.\r\nHenry had by now got what might be called in the slang of the time “the\r\nmarriage habit,” and honeymoon dalliance had hardly the same charm\r\nfor him as it usually is supposed to have with those blessed with a\r\nlesser succession of spouses. The consequence was that he was able to\r\ngive more attention to the necessary clearing up of the Scottish war,\r\nwhich finished at Solway Moss on December 14th, with the consequent\r\ndeath from chagrin of the Scottish King James V. The cause of the war,\r\nhowever, continued in the shape of a war with France which went on till\r\n1546 when peace was declared to the pecuniary benefit of the English\r\nKing. For the last two years of this time Henry carried on the war\r\nsinglehanded, as the Emperor Charles V, who had begun it as his ally,\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\nThere is a paragraph in Grafton’s _Chronicle_ published in 1569 which\r\nthrows a flood of light on Elizabeth’s absence at this time, 1543:\r\n“This yeare was in London a great death of the pestilence, and\r\ntherefore Mighelmas terme was adjourned to Saint Albones, and there it\r\nwas kept to the ende.”\r\n\r\nIn his _Girlhood of Queen Elizabeth_, Mr. Mumby says: “For some obscure\r\nreason Elizabeth seems to have fallen out of her father’s favour again\r\nvery soon after Catherine Parr had obtained his consent to her return\r\nto Court” (1543). No such cause for the removal of the Princess from\r\nLondon was necessary. It was probably to the presence of the pestilence\r\nin London that her removal to a remote and healthy place was due.\r\nFailing Prince Edward, then only five years of age and a weakly child,\r\nthe crown must--unless some constitutional revolution be effected in\r\nthe meantime or some future son be born to him--devolve on his female\r\nheirs, a matter pregnant with strife of unknown dimensions. Mary was\r\nnow twenty-seven years old and of a type that did not promise much for\r\nmaternity. At the same time, Mary, though his eldest living daughter,\r\nwas the hope of the Catholic party, to which he was in violent\r\nopposition; whereas in Elizabeth lay the hope of the whole of the party\r\nof the Reformation. Her life was to her father far beyond the calls of\r\nparental affection or dynastic ambition, and she had to be saved at all\r\ncosts from risk of health. Henry’s own experience of child-life was a\r\nbitter one. Of his five children by Catherine of Aragon only one, Mary,\r\nsurvived childhood. Elizabeth was the only survivor of Anne Boleyn;\r\nEdward, of Jane Seymour. Anne of Cleves had no children, and if report\r\nspoke truly no chance of having any. Catherine Howard was executed\r\nchildless. And he had only just married Catherine Parr, who had already\r\nhad two husbands.\r\n\r\nOn July 12, 1543, Henry married Catherine and in due course devoted\r\nhimself to the war. On the 14 July, 1544, he crossed from Dover to\r\nCalais to look after the conduct of affairs for himself, and on the\r\n26th began the siege of Boulogne. This lasted for two months when\r\nhaving reduced the city he returned home. On the 8 September he wrote\r\nto his wife to that effect. During his absence Queen Catherine was\r\nvicegerent and had manifestly as much public work on hand as she\r\ncould cope with. Bisley was a long way from London, and there were no\r\norganised posts in the sixteenth century. Moreover, ever since his\r\nlast marriage, Henry had been an invalid. He was now fifty-two years\r\nof age, of unhealthy body, and so heavy that he had to be lifted\r\nby machinery. Catherine was a devoted wife; and as Henry was both\r\nviolent and irritable she had little time at command to give to the\r\naffairs of other people. There was small opportunity for any one then\r\nwho was sufficiently in the focus of affairs to be cognisant of such\r\nan imposture as the tradition points out. Doubtless hereafter, when\r\na story so fascinating and at first glance so incredible begins to\r\nbe examined and its details thoroughly threshed out, more items of\r\nevidence or surmise than are at present available will be found for\r\nthe settlement of the question, one way or the other. In the meantime,\r\nbe it remembered, that we are only examining offhand a tradition made\r\nknown for the first time after three centuries. Our present business is\r\nto consider _possibilities_. Later on the time may come--as it surely\r\nwill; if the story can in the least be accepted--for the consideration\r\nof _probabilities_. Both of these tentative examinations will lead to\r\nthe final examination of possibility, of probability, and of proof\r\n_pro_ or _contra_.\r\n\r\nAt this stage we must admit that neither time nor opportunity present\r\nany difficulty in itself insuperable.\r\n\r\n\r\nG. THE IDENTITY OF ELIZABETH\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Documents_\r\n\r\nThe next matter with which we have to deal is regarding the identity of\r\nElizabeth. This needs (if necessary) a consideration of the facts of\r\nher life, and so far as we can realise them, from external appearance,\r\nmental and moral attitudes, and intentions. On account of space we\r\nmust confine this branch of the subject to the smallest portion of\r\ntime necessary to form any sort of just conclusion and accepting the\r\navailable records up to 1543, take the next period from that time\r\nto anywhere within the first few years of her reign--by which time\r\nher character was finally fixed and the policy on which her place in\r\nhistory is to be judged had been formulated and tested.\r\n\r\nThis implies in the first instance a brief (very brief) study of her\r\nphysique with a corollary in the shape of a few remarks on her heredity:\r\n\r\n_Grafton’s Chronicle_ states, under the date of 7 September 1533,\r\n“the Queene was delivered of a fayre Lady” which was his Courtly way\r\nof announcing the birth of a female princess, blond in colour. In all\r\nchronicles “fayre” means of light colour. In Wintown the reputed father\r\nof Macbeth--the Devil--is spoken of as a “fayre” man; evil qualities\r\nwere in that age attributed to blondes.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated from Greenwich Palace, 18 April, 1534, Sir\r\nWilliam Kingston said to Lord Lisle: “To-day, the King and Queen\r\nwere at Eltham” (where the royal nursery then was) “and saw my Lady\r\nPrincess--as goodly a child as hath been seen. Her Grace is much in the\r\nKing’s favour as a goodly child should be--God save her!”\r\n\r\nIn 1536, when Elizabeth was but three years old, Lady Bryan, the\r\n“Lady-mistress” of both Mary and her half-sister, wrote from Hunsdon\r\nto Lord Cromwell regarding the baby princess. “For she is as toward\r\na child and as gentle of conditions, as ever I knew any in my life.\r\nJesus preserve her Grace!” In the same letter she says “Mr. Shelton\r\nwould have my Lady Elizabeth to dine and sup every day at the board\r\nof estate. Alas! my Lord it is not meet for a child of her age to keep\r\nsuch rule yet. I promise you, my lord, I dare not take it upon me to\r\nkeep her Grace in health an’ she keep that rule. For there she shall\r\nsee divers meats, and fruits, and wines, which it would be hard for\r\nme to restrain her Grace from. Ye know, my lord, there is no place of\r\ncorrection there; and she is yet too young to correct greatly.”\r\n\r\nTestimony is borne according to Leti to the good qualities of the\r\nPrincess Elizabeth in these early years, by the affectionate regard in\r\nwhich she was held by two of Henry’s queens, the wronged and unhappy\r\nAnne of Cleves and the happy-natured Catherine Parr. Anne, he says,\r\nthough she had only seen her twice loved her much; she thought her\r\nbeautiful and full of spirit (“pleine d’esprit.”) Catherine, according\r\nto the same writer who had seen her often before her marriage to Henry,\r\nadmired her “esprit et ses manières.”\r\n\r\nIf Leti could only have spoken at first hand, his record of her would\r\nbe very valuable. But unhappily he was only born nearly thirty years\r\nafter her death. His history was manifestly written from records and as\r\nElizabeth’s fame was already made before he began to treat of her his\r\nwork is largely a panegyric of hearsay. There is, regarding the youth\r\nof the Princess, such an overdone flood of adulation that it is out of\r\nplace in a serious history of a human life. In his account of the time\r\nwhich we are considering, we find the child compared in both matters\r\nof body and mind to an angel. She is credited at the age of ten with an\r\namount of knowledge in all branches of learning sufficient to equip the\r\nillustrious men of a century. The fact is the Italian has accepted the\r\nqueen’s great position, and then reconstructed her youth to accord with\r\nit, in such a way as to show that whatever remarkable abilities she\r\npossessed were the direct outcome of her own natural qualities.[2]\r\n\r\n    [2] Amongst other branches of knowledge he credits her with\r\n        knowing well “Geography, Cosmography, Mathematics,\r\n        Architecture, Painting, Arithmetic, History, Mechanics.” She\r\n        had a special facility in learning languages; spoke and wrote\r\n        French, Italian, Spanish, Flemish. She loved poetry and wrote\r\n        it, but regarded it as a useless amusement and, as it was\r\n        distasteful to her, turned to history and politics. Finally\r\n        he adds: “She was naturally ambitious and always knew how to\r\n        hide her defects.”\r\n\r\nThe details above given are not merely meagre but are only explicable\r\nby the fact that during the earlier years of her life the child\r\nwas not considered of any importance. The circumstances of Anne’s\r\nmarriage--which in any case was delayed till it became a necessary\r\npreliminary to the legitimacy on which any future claim to the throne\r\nmust rest--did not make for a belief in the public mind for its\r\npermanency. Things were fluctuating in the religious world and few\r\nwere inclined to the belief that the Pope (with whom lay the last\r\nword and whose political leanings in favour of Catherine of Aragon\r\nand the validity of her marriage to Henry were well known) would be\r\noverthrown by the English King. And in any case, were Henry to be the\r\nfinal judge of appeal in his own case no great continuity of purpose\r\ncould be expected from him. The first important event which we have\r\nto consider with reference to the question before us is Elizabeth’s\r\nfirst letter to Queen Catherine (Parr) in 1543. In this the girl then\r\nten years old writes to her new step-mother, at whose marriage she\r\ntogether with her half-sister Mary had been present. It is in form a\r\ndutiful letter, not entirely without an apparent compulsion or at least\r\nintelligent supervision. As it stands, it is impossible to believe\r\nthat it emanated from a child of ten quite free to follow out its\r\ninclinations. The dutifulness is altogether, or largely, due to the\r\ntraining and self-suppression of the royal child of an arbitrary father\r\nwith absolute power. But it remains for each reader to consider it\r\nimpartially. The points which we should do well to note here are its\r\nplain form of expression, and its entire absence of personal affection.\r\nThe latter is all the more marked in that it was a letter of thanks for\r\na kindness conferred. Elizabeth was very anxious to come to her father,\r\nand Catherine had furthered her wish and secured its fulfilment. After\r\nthe marriage, the child, as is shown (or rather inferred), had been\r\nsent away for more than a year, which absence had been prolonged for at\r\nleast six months--as already shown.\r\n\r\nThere is little evidence of Elizabeth’s inner nature in these early\r\ndays; but we have every right to think that she was of a peaceable,\r\nkindly and affectionate nature. Lady Bryan her first nurse or governess\r\n(after Lady Boleyn, Anne’s mother) thought highly of her. Catherine\r\nAshley, who had charge of her next, loved her and was her devoted\r\nservant, friend and confidant till her death.\r\n\r\nThomas Parry her life-long friend was devoted to her, and when the\r\ncircumstances of their respective lives and the happenings of the time\r\nkept them apart, she restored him at the first opportunity and made his\r\nfortune her special care.\r\n\r\nThere is little base here on which to build an inverted pyramid; our\r\nonly safety is in taking things as they seem to be and using common\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Changes_\r\n\r\nLet us now take the years beginning with 1544. From this time on, more\r\nis known of the personality of Elizabeth; in fact there is little\r\nunknown, that is, of matters of fact, and to this only we must devote\r\nourselves. Whatever may have been Elizabeth’s motives we can only infer\r\nthem. She was a secretive person and took few into her confidence,\r\nunless it was of vital necessity--and then only in matters required by\r\nthe circumstance. The earliest knowledge we have of this second period\r\nof her history is in her letter to Queen Catherine (Parr) written from\r\nSt. James’ Palace on 31 July, 1544.\r\n\r\nIn the year which had elapsed since her last recorded letter\r\nElizabeth’s literary style had entirely changed. The meagre grudging\r\nstyle has become elegant and even florid with the ornate grace and\r\nimagery afforded by the study of the Latin and French tongues.\r\nAltogether there is not merely a more accomplished diction but there\r\nis behind it a truer feeling and larger sympathy. It is more in accord\r\nwith the letter accompanying the gift to the Queen, of her translation\r\nof the _Mirror of the Sinful Soul_ which she had dedicated to her.\r\n\r\nHistorians have given various rescripts of certain earlier letters of\r\nthe Princess Elizabeth, but none of them seem in harmony of thought\r\nwith this, whereas it is quite in accord with her later writings.\r\nMetabolism is an accepted doctrine of physiology; but its scope is\r\nnot--as yet at all events--extended to the intellect, and we must take\r\nthings as we find them within the limits of human knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be as well to reserve the consideration of any other\r\npoint, except the change in actual identity, till the complete analogy\r\nof all natural processes is an established fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Her personality_\r\n\r\nWe have no letters of Princess Elizabeth before 1543 which are not open\r\nto grave doubt as to date, but there is one letter to which allusion\r\nmust almost of necessity be made. It is a letter from Roger Ascham,\r\ntutor to the Princess Elizabeth, to Mrs. Ashley. No date is given\r\nby Mr. Mumby, but he states in his text that it was written “during\r\nGrindal’s term of office” as tutor to the Princess. Mumby quotes from\r\nthe _Elizabeth_ of Miss Strickland, who in turn quotes from Whittaker’s\r\n_Richmondshire_. Now Grindal’s term of office lasted from 1546\r\n(probably the end of that year) till it was cut short by his death from\r\nthe Plague in 1548, so that he could not have known his royal pupil\r\n_before_ 1544. The text of the letter leads a careful reader to infer\r\nthat it was written _after_ that date. The important part of the letter\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n    “... the thanks you have deserved from that noble imp by your\r\n    labour and wisdom now flourishing in all goodly godliness.... I\r\n    wish her Grace (Elizabeth) to come to that end in perfectness\r\n    and likelihood of her wit and painlessness in her study, true\r\n    trade of her teaching, which your diligent overseeing doth most\r\n    constantly promise.... I wish all increase of virtue and honour\r\n    to that my good lady, whose wit, good Mrs. Ashley, I beeseech\r\n    you somewhat favour. Blunt edges be dull and dure much pain to\r\n    little profit; the free edge is soon turned if it be not handled\r\n    thereafter. If you pour much drink at once into a goblet, the\r\n    most part will dash out and run over; if ye pour it softly you\r\n    may fill it even to the top, and so her Grace, I doubt not, by\r\n    little and little may be increased in learning, that at length\r\n    greater cannot be required.”\r\n\r\nIf this letter means anything at all--which in the case of such a man\r\nas Roger Ascham is not to be doubted--it means that Mrs. Ashley, then\r\nher governess, was cautioned not to press the little girl overmuch\r\nin her lessons. It is an acknowledgment of the teacher’s zeal as well\r\nas affection, and in the flowery and involved style of the period and\r\nthe man, illustrates the theory by pointing out the error of trying to\r\nfill a small vessel from a larger one by pouring too fast. She is not\r\na backward child, he says in effect, but go slowly with her education,\r\nyou cannot give full learning all at once.\r\n\r\nCompare this letter with that of the same writer to John Sturmius,\r\nRector of the Protestant University of Strasbourg, on the same subject\r\nin 1550:\r\n\r\n    “The Lady Elizabeth has accomplished her sixteenth year; and so\r\n    much of solidity of understanding, such courtesy united with\r\n    dignity, have never been observed at so early an age. She has\r\n    the most ardent love of true religion and of the best kind of\r\n    literature. The constitution of her mind is exempt from female\r\n    weakness, and she is endued with a masculine power of application.\r\n\r\n    “No apprehension can be quicker than hers, no memory more\r\n    retentive. French and Italian she speaks like English; Latin with\r\n    fluency, propriety and judgment; she also spoke Greek with me,\r\n    frequently, willingly, and understanding well. Nothing can be\r\n    more elegant than her handwriting, whether in the Greek or Roman\r\n    character. In music she is very skilful but does not greatly\r\n    delight. With respect to personal decoration, she greatly prefers\r\n    a simple elegance to show and splendour, so despising the outward\r\n    adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold, that in\r\n    the whole manner of her life she rather resembles Hippolyta than\r\n    Phædra.”\r\n\r\nThat such a scholar as Roger Ascham makes the simile is marked.\r\nHippolyta was a Queen of the Amazons and Phædra was an almost\r\npreternaturally womanly woman, one with a tragic intensity of passion.\r\n\r\nThe Elizabeth whom we know from 1544 to 1603 certainly had brains\r\nenough to protect her neck. In 1549 Sir Robert Tyrwhitt wrote to the\r\nProtector Somerset, apropos of the strenuous effort being made to gain\r\nfrom her some admission damaging to herself concerning Thomas Seymour’s\r\nattempts to win her hand:\r\n\r\n“She hath a very pretty wit and nothing is gotten out of her but by\r\ngreat policy.”\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Simon Renard Ambassador to the Emperor Charles V dated\r\nLondon September 23, 1553, there is incidentally a statement regarding\r\nElizabeth’s character which it is wise to hold in mind when discussing\r\nthis particular period of her history. Writing of Elizabeth’s first\r\nattendance at Mass he said: “she, Mary, ... entreated Madame Elizabeth\r\nto speak freely of all that was on her conscience, to which the\r\nPrincess replied that she was resolved to declare publicly that in\r\ngoing to Mass as in all else that she had done, she had only obeyed the\r\nvoice of her conscience; and that she had acted freely, without fear,\r\ndeceit, or pretence. We have since been told, however, that the said\r\nLady Elizabeth is very timid, and that while she was speaking with the\r\nQueen she trembled very much.”\r\n\r\nCompare with this the letter of 16th March, 1554 to the Queen (Mary)\r\nwritten just as she was told to go to the Tower. In this letter which\r\nis beautifully written and with not a trace of agitation she protests\r\nher innocence of any plot. Her mental attitude was thoroughly borne\r\nout by a calm dignity of demeanour which is more in accord with male\r\nthan female nature. In very fact Elizabeth appears all her life since\r\n1544 to have been playing with great thoughtfulness and yet dexterity a\r\ndiplomatic game--acting with histrionic subtlety a part which she had\r\nchosen advisedly.\r\n\r\nA good idea of the personality of Elizabeth during the period beginning\r\nwith 1544 may be had from a brief consideration of the risks which a\r\nperson taking up such an imposture would run, first at the time of\r\nbeginning the venture and then of sustaining the undertaken rôle.\r\nAt the outset a boy of ten or eleven would not think of taking it\r\nseriously. At first he would look on it as a “lark” and carry out the\r\nidea with a serious energy only known in play-time. Later thought\r\nwould give it a new charm in the shape of danger. This, while adding\r\nto his great zest, would sober him; thence on it would be a game--just\r\nsuch a game as a boy loves, perpetual struggle to get the best of\r\nsomeone else. To some natures wit against wit is a better strife than\r\nstrength against strength, and if one were well equipped for such a\r\nfray the game would satisfy the ambition of his years. In any case when\r\nonce such a game was entered on, the stake would be his own head--a\r\nconsideration which must undoubtedly make for strenuous effort--even in\r\nboyhood.\r\n\r\nThe task which would have followed--which did follow if the Bisley\r\nstory is true--would have been vastly greater. If the imposture\r\nescaped immediate detection--which is easily conceivable--a new kind\r\nof endeavour would have been necessary; one demanding the utmost care\r\nand perpetual vigilance in addition to the personal qualities necessary\r\nfor the carrying out of the scheme. Little help could be given to the\r\nyoung boy on whom rested the weight of what must have appeared to all\r\nconcerned in it a stupendous undertaking. From the nature of the task,\r\nwhich was one which even the faintest breath of suspicion would have\r\nruined, the little band, originally involved, could gain no assistance.\r\nSafety was only possible by the maintenance of the most rigid secrecy.\r\nAll around them were enemies served by a host of zealous spies. If then\r\nthe story be true, those who carried such an enterprising situation\r\nto lasting success, must have been no common persons. Let us suppose\r\nfor a moment that the story was true. In such case the Boy of Bisley\r\nwho acted the part of the Princess Elizabeth could have had only two\r\nassistants--assistants even if they were only passive. _Whatever_ may\r\nhave happened we know from history that both Mrs. Ashley and Thomas\r\nParry were ingrainedly loyal to Elizabeth, as she was to them. For\r\nconvenience we shall speak of the substitute of the Princess as\r\nthough he were the Princess herself whom he appeared to be, and for\r\nwhom he was accepted thenceforth. That the imposture--if there was\r\none--succeeded is a self-evident fact; for almost sixty years there was\r\nno question raised by any person of either sex and of any political\r\nopinion. The statecraft of England, France, the Papacy, and the German\r\nEmpire were either unsuspicious or in error--or both. It is reasonable\r\nto imagine that a person of strong character and active intelligence\r\nmight have steered deftly between these variously opposing forces. It\r\nis conceivable that in the case of a few individuals there might have\r\nbeen stray fragmentary clouds of suspicion; though if there were any\r\nthey must have come to those who were held to a consequent inactivity\r\nby other dominating causes. We shall have occasion presently to touch\r\non this subject but in the meantime we must accept it that there was no\r\nopinion expressed by any one in such a way as necessarily to provoke\r\naction. Of course after a time even suspicion became an impossibility.\r\nHere was a young girl growing into womanhood whom all around her had\r\nknown all her life--or what was equivalent--believed they had. It is\r\nonly now after three centuries that we can consider who it was that\r\nformed the tally of those who knew the personality of Elizabeth during\r\nboth periods of her youth, that up to 1543-4 and that which followed.\r\nHenry VIII manifestly not only had no doubt on the subject but no\r\nthought. If he had had he was just the man to have settled it at once.\r\nAnne Boleyn was dead, so was her predecessor in title. Anne of Cleves\r\nhad accepted the annulment of her marriage--and a pension. Jane Seymour\r\nand Catherine Howard were both dead. Nearly all those who as nurses,\r\ngovernesses, or teachers, Lady Bryan, Richard Croke, William Grindal,\r\nRoger Ascham, who knew the first period were dead or had retired into\r\nother spheres. Those who remained knowing well the individuality of the\r\nPrincess and representing both periods were Mrs. Ashley, Thomas Parry\r\nand the Queen (later dowager) Catherine Parr.\r\n\r\nWe know already of the faithfulness of the two former, the man who\r\nwas a clever as well as a faithful servant, and the woman, who having\r\nno children of her own, took to her heart the little child entrusted\r\nto her care and treated her with such affectionate staunchness--a\r\nstaunchness which has caused more than one historian to suspect that\r\nthere was some grave secret between them which linked their fortunes\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAs to Catherine Parr we are able to judge from her letters that she was\r\nfond of her step-daughter and was consistently kind to her. Those who\r\nchoose to study the matter further can form an opinion of their own\r\nfrom certain recorded episodes which, given without any elucidating\r\npossibilities leave the historians in further doubt. Leti puts in\r\nhis _Life_, under the date of 1543, “before her marriage to Henry,\r\nCatherine Parr had seen often Elizabeth and admired her.” The Italian\r\nhistorian _may_ have had some authority for the statement; but also\r\nit may have been taken from some statement made by Elizabeth in later\r\nyears or by some person in her interest, to create a misleading belief.\r\nIn any case let us accept the statement as a matter of fact. If so\r\nit may throw a light on another branch of this eternal and diverse\r\nmystery. Martin Hume and F. A. Mumby approaching the subject from\r\ndifferent points confess themselves puzzled by Elizabeth’s attitude to\r\nmen. The former writes in his _Courtships of Queen Elizabeth_:\r\n\r\n    “No one can look at the best portraits of Elizabeth without\r\n    recognising at a glance that she was not a sensual woman. The\r\n    lean, austere face, the tight thin lips, the pointed delicate\r\n    chin, the cold dull eyes, tell of a character the very opposite\r\n    of lascivious.”\r\n\r\nMr. Mumby writing about Mrs. Ashley’s “Confession” and of the\r\nhorse-play between Elizabeth and Lord Seymour (whom Queen Catherine had\r\nmarried immediately after the King’s death) makes this remark:\r\n\r\n    “The most surprising thing about this behaviour is that the Queen\r\n    should have encouraged it.”\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of room for wonder, considering that Admiral Seymour\r\nhad earlier wanted to marry Elizabeth. But Catherine was a clever\r\nwoman, who had already had three husbands--Seymour was her fourth--and\r\nchildren. If any one would see through a boy’s disguise as a girl\r\nshe was the one. It is hard to imagine that Seymour’s wife had not\r\ngood cause for some form revenge on him of whom Hallam speaks of as a\r\n“dangerous and unprincipled man” and of whom Latimer said “he was a man\r\nfarthest from the fear of God that ever I knew or heard of in England”\r\nas it was believed at the time of her death that he had poisoned his\r\nwife, the Queen dowager, to make way for a marriage with Elizabeth,\r\nwith whom according to common belief he was still in love, it would\r\nbe only natural that a woman of her disposition and with her sense\r\nof humour, should revenge herself in a truly wifely way by using for\r\nthe purpose, without betraying the secret, her private knowledge or\r\nbelief of the quasi-princess’s real sex. Such would afford an infinite\r\ngratification to an ill-used wife jealous of so vain a husband.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DUKE OF RICHMOND]\r\n\r\nWe now come to the crux of the whole story--the touchstone of this\r\nstrange eventful history. Could there have been such a boy as is told\r\nof; one answering to the many conditions above shown to be vitally\r\nnecessary for the carrying out of such a scheme of imposture. The\r\nanswer to this question is distinctly in the affirmative; there _could_\r\nhave been such a boy; had the Duke of Richmond been born fourteen or\r\nfifteen years earlier than he was, the difficulties of appearance,\r\nintellect, education, and other qualifications need not have presented\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIf the question to be asked is: “Was there such a boy?” the\r\nanswer cannot be so readily given. In the meantime there are some\r\nconsiderations from the study of which--or through which--an answer\r\nmay, later, be derived.\r\n\r\n\r\nH. THE SOLUTION\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Richmond_\r\n\r\nThe points which must be settled before we can solve the mystery of the\r\n_Bisley Boy_ are:\r\n\r\n(1) Was there such an episode regarding the early life of the Princess\r\nElizabeth?\r\n\r\n(2) Was there such a boy as was spoken of?\r\n\r\n(3) How could such an imposture have been carried out, implying as it\r\ndid--\r\n\r\n(a) A likeness to the Princess so extraordinary as not to have created\r\nsuspicion in the mind of anyone not already in the plot.\r\n\r\n(b) An acquaintance with the circumstances of the life of the Princess\r\nsufficiently accurate to ward off incipient suspicion caused by any\r\noverlooking or neglect of necessary conditions.\r\n\r\n(c) An amount of education and knowledge equal to that held by a child\r\nof ten to twelve years of age who had been taught by some of the most\r\nlearned persons of the time.\r\n\r\n(d) A skill in classics and foreign tongues only known amongst high\r\nscholars and diplomatists.\r\n\r\n(e) An ease of body and a courtliness of manner and bearing utterly\r\nforeign to any not bred in the higher circles of social life.\r\n\r\nIf there could be found a boy answering such conditions--one whose\r\nassistance could be had with facility and safety--then the solution is\r\npossible, even if not susceptible of the fullest proof. Following the\r\nlines of argument hitherto used in this book, let us first consider\r\nreasons why such an argument is tenable. I may then perhaps be allowed\r\nto launch the theory which has come to me during this investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _His Birth and Appearance_\r\n\r\nA part--and no small part--of the bitterness of Henry VIII in not\r\nhaving a son to succeed him was that, though he had a son, such could\r\nnot by the existing law succeed him on the throne.\r\n\r\nNearly ten years after his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and after\r\na son and other children had been born to them, all of whom had died\r\nshortly after birth, Henry had in the manner of mediæval kings--and\r\nothers--entered on a love affair, the object of his illicit affection\r\nbeing one of the ladies-in-waiting to Queen Catherine, Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of John Blount of Knevet, Shropshire.\r\n\r\nThe story of this love affair is thus given in quaint old English in\r\n_Grafton’s Chronicle_ first published in 1569 which covers the period\r\nfrom 1189 to 1558:\r\n\r\n    “You shall understande, the King in his freshe youth was in the\r\n    cheynes of love with a faire damosell called Elizabeth Blunt,\r\n    daughter of Syr John Blunt Knight, which damosell in synging,\r\n    daunsing, and in all goodly pastimes, excelled all other, by the\r\n    which goodly pastimes, she wanne the king’s hart: and she againe\r\n    shewed him such favour that by him she bare a goodly man childe,\r\n    of beautie like to the father and mother. This child was well\r\n    brought up lyke a Princes childe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _His Upbringing and Marriage_\r\n\r\nThis son of an unlawful union--born in 1519 it is said--was called\r\nHenry Fitzroy after the custom applicable in such cases to the natural\r\nchildren of kings. Naturally enough his royal father took the greatest\r\ninterest in this child and did, whilst the latter lived, all in his\r\npower to further his interests. A mere list of the honours conferred on\r\nhim during his short life will afford some clue to the King’s intention\r\nof his further advancement, should occasion serve. The shower of\r\nfavours began in 1525 when the child, as is said, was only six years of\r\nage. On the 18th of June of this year he was created Earl of Nottingham\r\nand Duke of Richmond and Somerset, with precedence over all dukes\r\nexcept those of the King’s lawful issue. He was also made a Knight of\r\nthe Garter--of which exalted Order he was raised to the Lieutenancy\r\neight years later. He was also nominated to other high offices: the\r\nKing’s Lieutenant General for districts north of the Trent; and Keeper\r\nof the city and fortress of Carlisle. To these posts were added those\r\nof Lord High Admiral of England, Wales, Ireland, Normandy, Gascony and\r\nAquitaine; Warden General of the Marches of Scotland, and Receiver\r\nof Middleham and of Sheriff Hutton, Yorkshire. He was also given an\r\nincome of four thousand pounds sterling per annum. In 1529, being then\r\nonly ten years of age, he was also made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,\r\nConstable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports--three of the\r\nmost important offices of the Nation. A few months before his death\r\nin 1536 there was a general understanding that Henry VIII intended to\r\nmake him King of Ireland and possibly to nominate him as his successor\r\non the throne of England. That some such intention was in Henry’s mind\r\nwas shown by the Succession Act passed just before the close of the\r\nParliament which was dissolved in 1536. In this Act it is fixed that\r\nthe Crown is to devolve on the King’s death to the son of Jane Seymour\r\nand in default of issue by him, on Mary and Elizabeth in succession\r\nin case of lack of issue by the former. In the event of their both\r\ndying before the King and without issue he is to appoint by will his\r\nsuccessor on the throne.\r\n\r\nThe various important posts conferred on the young Duke of Richmond\r\nwere evidently preparations for the highest post of all, which in\r\ndefault of legitimate issue of his own legitimate children he intended\r\nto confer on him.\r\n\r\nThe education which was given to the little Duke is of especial\r\ninterest and ought in the present connection to be carefully studied.\r\nIt was under the care of Richard Croke, celebrated for his scholarship;\r\nwho in the modern branch was assisted by John Palsgrave the author of\r\nthe earliest English grammar of the French language “_Lesclarcissement\r\nde la langue Francoyse_.” In spite of the opposition of his household\r\nthe Duke of Richmond devoted his young life to study rather than to\r\narms. Whilst still a young boy he had already read a part of _Cæsar_,\r\n_Virgil_ and _Terence_, knew a little Greek, and was fairly skilful\r\nin music--singing and playing on the virginals. There was much talk\r\nin Court circles as to whom he should marry and many ladies of high\r\ndegree were named. One was a niece of Pope Clement VII; another was a\r\nDanish princess; still another a princess of France; also a daughter of\r\nEleanor, dowager Queen of Portugal, a sister of Charles V. This lady\r\nwas afterwards Queen of France.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1532 the Duke resided for a while at Hatfield. Then he went to\r\nParis with his friend the Earl of Surrey, son of the Duke of Norfolk.\r\nThere he remained till September, 1533. On his return to England he\r\nmarried by special dispensation, on 25 November, 1533, Mary Howard,\r\ndaughter of the Duke of Norfolk by his second marriage and sister of\r\nSurrey. Incidentally he is said to have been present at the beheading\r\nof Queen Anne (Boleyn), May 19, 1536. He did not long survive the\r\nlast-named exhibition, for some two months later--22 July, 1536, he\r\ndied. There was at the time a suspicion that he had been poisoned by\r\nLord Rochford, brother of Queen Anne (Boleyn).\r\n\r\nHenry Duke of Richmond and Somerset had no legal issue. As a matter\r\nof fact though he was married in 1533, nearly three years before his\r\ndeath, he never lived with his wife. It was said that he was not only\r\nyoung for matrimony, being only seventeen; but was in very bad health.\r\nIt was intended that after his marriage he should go to Ireland; but on\r\naccount of the state of his health that journey was postponed--as it\r\nturned out, for ever.\r\n\r\nA light on this ill-starred marriage is thrown in the quaint words of\r\nanother chronicler of the time, Charles Wriothesley, who wrote of the\r\ntime between 1485 and 1559.\r\n\r\n    “But the said younge duke had never layne by his wife, and so she\r\n    is maide, wife, and now a widowe; I praie God send her now good\r\n    fortune.”\r\n\r\nIn this summarised history certain points are to be noticed:\r\n\r\n(1) The Duke of Richmond was like his father (Henry VIII) and his\r\nmother who was “fayre.”\r\n\r\n(2) A Dispensation was obtained for his marriage to Lady Mary Howard\r\nwhich took place in 1533 but with whom he never cohabited.\r\n\r\nThere is a side-light here of the hereditary aspect of the case. Both\r\nthe Duke and Duchess of Richmond were “fayre,” and in the language of\r\nthe old chroniclers “fayre” means blonde. Wintown for instance speaking\r\nof Macbeth’s supposed descent from the Devil says:\r\n\r\n    “Gottyne he was on ferly wys\r\n    “Hys Modyr to woddis mad oft repayre\r\n    “For the delyte of halesum ayre.\r\n    “Swa, scho past a-pon a day\r\n    “Tyl a Wod, hyr for to play:\r\n    “Scho met at cas with a fayr man.”\r\n\r\nAnd Grafton thus speaks under date 7 September 1533 of Elizabeth’s\r\nbirth: “The Queen was delivered of a fayre Lady.”\r\n\r\nNow Anne Boleyn is described as small and lively, a brunette with black\r\nhair and beautiful eyes, and yet her daughter is given as red-haired by\r\nall the painters.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to make out the true colours of persons. For\r\ninstance Giovanni Michiel writing to the Venetian Senate in 1557 puts\r\nin his description of Elizabeth “She is tall and well formed, with a\r\ngood skin, although swarthy” but in the same page he says “she prides\r\nherself on her father and glories in him; everybody is saying that\r\nshe also resembles him more than the Queen [Mary] does.” As to the\r\nintroduction of the word “swarthy” as above; it may have been one of\r\nthe tricks of Elizabeth to keep the Venetian ambassador from knowing\r\ntoo much or getting any ground for guessing. If so it looks rather like\r\nElizabeth concealing her real identity--which would be an argument in\r\nfavour of an imposture; if she was the real princess there would be no\r\nneed for concealment.\r\n\r\nIt is only common sense to expect, if the paternal element was so\r\nstrong in Henry as to reproduce in offspring his own colour, that had\r\nthe Duke of Richmond had any issue especially by a fair wife it too\r\nwould have inherited something of the family colour. Holbein’s picture\r\nof the “Lady of Richmond,” as the Duke’s wife was called, shows her as\r\na fair woman.\r\n\r\nThese are two points to be here borne in mind; that Henry VIII was\r\nprobably bald, for in none of his pictures is any hair visible. It\r\nwould hardly be polite to infer that Elizabeth wore a wig for the same\r\nreason. But it is recorded that she always travelled with a stock of\r\nthem--no less than eighty of various colours.\r\n\r\nBut there are other indications of such concealment. Why for instance\r\ndid she object to see doctors? So long as she was free and could\r\ncontrol them she did not mind; but whilst she was under duress they\r\nwere a source of danger. Perhaps it is this which accounts for her\r\ntaking the Sacrament on 26 August, 1554 when she was practically a\r\nprisoner at Woodstock in the keeping of Sir Henry Bedingfield. About\r\nthe third week in June the Princess asked Sir Henry to be allowed to\r\nhave a doctor sent to her. He in turn applied to the Council who made\r\nanswer on the 25th that the Queen’s Oxford physician was ill and Mr.\r\nWendy was absent and the remaining one, Mr. Owen, could not be spared.\r\nThe latter however recommended two Oxford doctors, Barnes and Walbec,\r\nin case she should care to see either of them. On July 4th Sir Henry\r\nreported to the Council that Elizabeth in politely declining said: “I\r\nam not minded to make any stranger privy to the state of my body, but\r\ncommit it to God.” Then, when through her submission to the Queen’s\r\nreligious convictions she had obtained her liberty, she took no more\r\nconcern in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Duchess of Richmond_\r\n\r\nThomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, married twice. His second wife was the\r\nlady Elizabeth Stafford, eldest daughter of the Duke of Buckingham, and\r\nhe had issue by both marriages. In 1533 the only surviving daughter of\r\nthe second marriage was Mary, who was thus the Lady Mary Howard, sister\r\nof the Earl of Surrey. It was this lady with whom the uncompleted\r\nmarriage of the Duke of Richmond took place. Doubtless they were early\r\nfriends. In her youth she used to spend the summer at Tendring Hall,\r\nSuffolk, and the winter at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, where was one of\r\nHenry’s palaces; in addition Henry was one of the closest companions of\r\nher brother, the Earl of Surrey. Lady Richmond’s part in the historical\r\nepisode before us is hardly direct. It only comes in through two\r\ncircumstances not unattended with mystery. It is not necessary that\r\nthe two were correlated; but no student can get away from the idea\r\nthat there was some connection between them, especially when there is\r\nanother inference bearing on the subject with reference to the second\r\nmarriage of the Duchess. This took place after an interval of some\r\nyears to Gilbert, son of Sir George Talboys of Goloths, Lincolnshire.\r\nThe name of the second husband is variously spelled in the chronicles\r\nas Tailboise or Talebuse. She died in the year before Elizabeth came\r\nto the throne. The two things to examine closely with regard to\r\nthis marriage to the Duke of Richmond were the Dispensation for the\r\nmarriage (together with the date of it), and its non-fulfilment. The\r\nDispensation was dated 28 November, 1533, but the marriage took place\r\nthree days earlier. Whether this discrepancy had anything to do with\r\nher later marriage to Talboys we can only guess--unless of course more\r\nexhaustive search can produce some document, unknown as yet, which may\r\nthrow light on the subject. It is a matter of no light mystery why a\r\nDispensation was obtained at such a time and by whom it was effected.\r\nAt this time Henry VIII was engaged in the bitterest struggle of his\r\nlife, that regarding the supremacy of the Pope, so that it was a direct\r\nviolation of his policy to have asked for, or even to recognise such a\r\nDispensation in the case of his own son whom he intended to succeed him\r\nas King. Before a year had passed he had actually thrown over the Papal\r\nauthority altogether, and had taken into his own hands the headship\r\nof the National Church. What then was behind such a maladroit action?\r\nIf it had been done as a piece of statecraft--the ostensible showing\r\nthat there was as yet no direct rupture between the British Nation and\r\nthe Papacy--it would have lost its efficacy if it might be cited as\r\na Court favour rather than a national right. Moreover, as it was to\r\nsanction by then existing canonical law a marriage of Henry’s son with\r\na daughter of the head of the most powerful Catholic House in England,\r\nit could not be expected that Rome would not use this in its strife for\r\nthe continuation of its supremacy. If Henry was directly concerned in\r\nthe matter, it was bad policy and unlike him to conciliate Catholicism\r\nby a yielding on the part of one who would be in the future the Head\r\nof the Reformed Church. Altogether it leaves one under the impression\r\nthat there must have been a more personal cause than any yet spoken of.\r\nSomething to be covered up, or from which suspicion should be averted.\r\nThere was already quite enough material for a controversy in case Henry\r\nFitzroy should come to the throne and it might be well to minimise\r\nany further risk. But in such case what was there to be covered up or\r\nfrom which suspicion should be averted? Already Richmond held under\r\nhis father all the threads of government in his own hand. If he ever\r\nshould need to tighten them it would be done by himself as ruler. There\r\nmust still be some reason which must be kept secret and of which Henry\r\nhimself did not and must not know. Beyond this again was the question\r\nof the personal ambition of “Bluff King Hal.” It was not sufficient\r\nfor him that a barren heir should succeed him--even if that heir was\r\nhis own son. He wanted to found a dynasty, and if he suspected for\r\nan instant that after all his plotting and striving--all his titanic\r\nefforts to overcome such obstacles as nations and religions--his hopes\r\nmight fail through lack of issue on his son’s part he would cease to\r\nwaste his time and efforts on his behalf. It is almost impossible to\r\nimagine that the Duke of Richmond had not had _some_ love affairs--if\r\nindeed he was only seventeen (of which there is a doubt)--it must be\r\nborne in mind that both the Lancastrians and the Yorkists who united\r\nin the Tudor stock matured early. On both his father’s and mother’s\r\nside Henry Fitzroy was of a pleasure-loving, voluptuous nature, and\r\nas the masculine element predominated in his make-up there is not any\r\ngreat stretch of imagination required to be satisfied that there was\r\nsome young likeness of him toddling or running about. But in a case\r\nlike his masculine mis-doing does not count; it is only where a woman’s\r\ncredit is at stake that secrecy is a vital necessity. We must therefore\r\nlook to the female side to find a cause for any mystery which there\r\nmay be. So far as a boy of the right age is concerned with a decided\r\nlikeness to Henry VIII it would not have required much searching about\r\nto lay hands on a suitable one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    The Lady of Richmond.\r\n\r\nTHE DUCHESS OF RICHMOND]\r\n\r\nBut here a new trouble would begin. It would be beyond nature to expect\r\nthat any mother would consent, especially at a moment’s notice, to\r\nher child running such a risk as the substitute of the dead Princess\r\nElizabeth was taking, without some kind of assurance or guarantee of\r\nhis safety. Moreover, if there were other relatives, they would be sure\r\nto know, and some of them to make trouble unless their mouths were\r\nclosed. Practically the only chance of carrying such an enterprise\r\nthrough would be if the substitute were an orphan or in a worse\r\nposition--one whose very life was an embarrassment to those to whom it\r\nshould be most dear.\r\n\r\nHere opens a field for romantic speculation. Such need not clash with\r\nhistory which is a record of fact. Call it romance if we will; indeed\r\nuntil we have more perfect records we must. If invention is to be\r\ncalled in to the aid of deduction no one can complain if these two\r\nmethods of exercise of intellect are kept apart and the boundaries\r\nbetween them are duly charted. Any speculation beyond this can be only\r\nregarded as belonging to the region of pure fiction.\r\n\r\nIn one way there is a duty which the reader must not shirk, if\r\nonly on his own account: not to refuse to accept facts without due\r\nconsideration. Wildly improbable as the Bisley story is, it is not\r\nimpossible. Whoever says, offhand, that such a story is untrue on the\r\nface of it ought to study the account of a death reported at Colchester\r\nin Essex just a hundred years ago. A servant died who had been in\r\nthe same situation as housemaid and nurse for thirty years. But only\r\nafter death was the true sex of the apparent woman discovered. It was\r\nmasculine!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere I must remind such readers as honour my work with their attention\r\nthat I am venturing merely to tell a tradition sanctioned by long time,\r\nand that I only give as comments historical facts which may be tested\r\nby any student. I have invented and shall invent nothing; and only\r\nclaim the same right which I have in common with every one else--that\r\nof forming my own opinion.\r\n\r\nHere it is that we may consider certain additions to the original\r\nBisley tradition. How these are connected with the main story is\r\nimpossible to say after the lapse of centuries; but in all probability\r\nthere is a basis of ancient belief in all that has been added. The\r\nfollowing items cover the additional ground.\r\n\r\nWhen the governess wished to hide the secret hurriedly, she hid the\r\nbody, intending it to be only temporarily, in the stone coffin which\r\nlay in the garden at Overcourt outside the Princess’s window.\r\n\r\nSome tens of years ago the bones of a young girl lying amidst rags of\r\nfine clothing were found in the stone coffin.\r\n\r\nThe finder was a churchman--a man of the highest character and a member\r\nof a celebrated ecclesiastical family.\r\n\r\nThe said finder firmly believed in the story of the Bisley Boy.\r\n\r\nBefore Elizabeth came to the throne all those who knew the secret of\r\nthe substitution were in some way got rid of or their silence assured.\r\n\r\nThe name of the substituted youth was Neville; or such was the name of\r\nthe family with whom he was living at the time.\r\n\r\nThere are several persons in the neighbourhood of Bisley who accept the\r\ngeneral truth of the story even if some of the minor details appear at\r\nfirst glance to be inharmonious. These persons are not of the ordinary\r\nclass of gossipers, but men and women of light and leading who have\r\nfixed places in the great world and in the social life of their own\r\nneighbourhood. With some of them the truth of the story is an old\r\nbelief which makes a tie with any new investigator.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Unfulfilled Marriage_\r\n\r\nThe remaining point to touch on is the unfulfilled marriage of the Duke\r\nof Richmond. This certainly needs some explanation, or else the mystery\r\nremains dark as ever.\r\n\r\nHere we have two young persons of more than fair presence, and graced\r\nwith all the endearing qualities that the mind as well as the eye can\r\ngrasp. We have the assurance of Chronicles regarding Henry Fitzroy;\r\nand from Holbein’s picture we can judge for ourselves of the lady’s\r\nmerits. They are both well-to-do. The lady, one of title, daughter of\r\none of the most prominent Dukes in England, the man then holding many\r\nof the most important posts in the State, and with every expectation of\r\nwearing in due course the purple of royalty. They both come of families\r\nof which other members have been notorious for amatory episodes;\r\nvoluptuousness is in their blood. They have been old friends--and yet\r\nwhen they marry they at once separate, she going to her own folk and\r\nhe to Windsor. Seemingly they do not meet again in the two and a half\r\nyears that elapse before his death. The story about his youth and\r\nhealth preventing cohabitation is all moonshine. The affair points to\r\nthe likelihood of some ante-matrimonial liaison of which, as yet, we\r\nknow nothing. Applying the experiences of ordinary life in such cases,\r\nwe can easily believe that Mary Howard, egged on by her unscrupulous\r\nand ambitiously-intriguing brother, was for ulterior purposes either\r\nforced or helped into an intrigue with the young Duke. There is no\r\ndoubt that Surrey was unscrupulous enough for it. A similar design on\r\nhis part--only infinitely more base--cost him his head. He had tried\r\nto induce his sister, Duchess of Richmond, to become mistress of Henry\r\nVIII--her own father-in-law!--so that she might have power over him;\r\nand it does not seem that there was any wonderful indignation on the\r\npart of the lady at the shameful proposal.\r\n\r\nWe are told that when Sir John Gates and Sir Richard Southwell, the\r\nroyal Commissioners for examining witnesses in the case of the charge\r\nof treason against the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Surrey, arrived\r\nat Kenninghall in the early morning and made known their general\r\npurposes in coming, the Duchess of Richmond “almost fainted.” But all\r\nthe same when she knew more exactly what they wanted she promised\r\nwithout any forcing to tell all she knew. As a matter of fact her\r\nevidence (with that of Elizabeth Holland, the mistress of the Duke of\r\nNorfolk), whilst it helped to get Norfolk off, aided in condemning\r\nSurrey. There must have been some other cause for her consternation.\r\nShe had been bred up in the midst of intrigues, polemical and dynastic\r\nas well as of personal ambition, and was well inured to keeping her\r\ncountenance as well as her head in moments of stress. The cause of her\r\n“almost fainting” must have been something which concerned her even\r\nmore nearly than either father or brother. It could only have been fear\r\nfor her child or herself--or for both. It is possible that she dreaded\r\ndiscovery of some sort. _Omne ignotum pro magnifico._ Suspicion has\r\nlong flexible tentacula, with eyes and ears at the end of them, which\r\ncan penetrate everywhere and see and hear everything. She knew how to\r\ndread suspicion and to fear the consequences which must result from\r\ninquiry or investigation of any sort. If she had had a child it must\r\nhave been kept hidden, and if possible far away--as the unknown Boy\r\nwas at Bisley. Indeed the Howards had immense family ramifications and\r\nseveral of them had collateral relationships in and about Bisley. There\r\nwere Nevilles there, and doubtless some of them were poor relations\r\nrelegated to the far away place where living was cheap and where they\r\nmight augment their tenuous incomes by taking in even poorer relations\r\nthan themselves whose rich relatives wished to hide them away. It is\r\nonly a surmise; but if there had been a case of a child unaccounted\r\nfor, which any member of so great a family as the Howards wished to\r\nkeep dark, it would be hard to find a more favourable locality than\r\nthe little almost inaccessible hamlet in the Cotswolds. If there were\r\nsuch a child, how easy it would all have been. When the Duke was\r\nmarried he was fourteen or perhaps sixteen at most--an age which\r\nthough over-young for fatherhood in the case of ordinary men seemed to\r\noffer to the Plantagenet-York-Lancaster blood no absolute difficulty\r\nof taking up such responsibility. As Elizabeth was only born some two\r\nmonths before the Duke’s marriage there was not any time to spare--a\r\nfact which would doubtless have been used to his advantage if Henry’s\r\nnatural son had lived. In all probability Richmond’s marriage was a\r\npart of the plot for aggrandisement of the Howards which began with the\r\nunscrupulous securing by Surrey of the son of Henry VIII at the cost of\r\nhis sister’s honour; and ended with the death of Surrey as a traitor--a\r\ndoom which his father only escaped by the King dying whilst the Act\r\nof Attainder was lying ready for his signature. If this reasoning be\r\ncorrect--though the data on which it is founded be meagre and without\r\nactual proof--as yet--the risk of Duchess Mary’s child born before\r\nher marriage must have been a terrible hazard. On one side perhaps\r\nthe most powerful sceptre in the world as guerdon; on the other death\r\nand ruin of the child on which such hopes were built. No wonder then\r\nthat Duchess Mary “almost fainted” when in the early dawn the King’s\r\nCommissioners conveyed to her the broad object of their coming. No\r\nwonder that freed by larger knowledge from the worst apprehension which\r\ncould be for her, she announced her willingness to conceal nothing\r\nthat she knew. That promise could not and would not have been made\r\nhad the whole range of possibilities, which as yet no one suspected,\r\nbeen opened to their investigation. For even beyond the concern which\r\nshe felt from the arbitrary power of the King and at the remorseless\r\ngrip of the law, she had reason to doubt her own kin--the nearest of\r\nthem--in such a struggle as was going on around them when the whole of\r\nthe Empire, the Kingdom of England, France and Spain, and the Papacy\r\nwere close to the melting-pot. It would have been but a poor look-out\r\nfor a youth of a little more than a dozen years of age had fate made\r\nhim the shuttlecock of such strenuous players who did not hold “fair\r\nplay” as a primary rule of the game in which they were engaged.\r\n\r\nIn his _Life of Elizabeth_, Gregario Leti concludes a panegyric on the\r\nQueen’s beauty with the following: “This was accompanied by such inward\r\nqualities that those who knew her were accustomed to say that heaven\r\nhad given her such rare qualities that she was doubtless reserved for\r\nsome great work in the world.” The Italian historian perhaps “builded\r\nbetter than he knew,” for whether the phrase applies to the one who is\r\nsupposed to have occupied the throne or one who did so occupy it, it\r\nis equally true. The world at that crisis wanted just such an one as\r\nElizabeth. All honour to her whosoever she may have been, boy or girl\r\nmatters not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ahasuerus, 111-114.\r\n\r\n  Alcaçer-el-Kebir, battle of, 20-22, 25.\r\n\r\n  Alvares, Matheus, 23.\r\n\r\n  Althotas, 82.\r\n\r\n  Ascham, Roger, letters of concerning Elizabeth, 316-318.\r\n\r\n  Ashley, Mrs. Catherine, 284, 285, 298, 315, 321, 323, 324.\r\n\r\n  Austin, “Beau,” murder of by John Law, 124, 134.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Balsamo, Joseph, early life of, 80-82.\r\n\r\n  Bank of England, early history of, 140-142.\r\n\r\n  Banque Générale, founding of by John Law, 126.\r\n\r\n  Banque Royale, control of by John Law, 127, 130.\r\n\r\n  Berners Street Hoax, 252-254.\r\n\r\n  Beugnot, Comte de, description of Cagliostro by, 86, 87.\r\n\r\n  Bingham, Jinny, Mother Red-Cap, 186-189.\r\n\r\n  Bisley, 286-291, 294.\r\n\r\n  Bisley Boy, The, 283-345.\r\n\r\n  Bisley Tradition, The, 291-294, 339-340.\r\n\r\n  Bogus Sausages, 260-262.\r\n\r\n  Brinvilliers, Marquise de, 169-172.\r\n\r\n  Brunneau, Mathurin, 40-41.\r\n\r\n  Buried Treasure Hoax, The, 258-259.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cagliostro, career of, 80-94.\r\n\r\n  Castro, Don John de, prophecy of concerning Sebastian, 24,\r\n    visit of to impostor, 26-27.\r\n\r\n  Cat Hoax, The, 255.\r\n\r\n  Catizzone, Marco Tullio, 27, 28, 29.\r\n\r\n  Catherine, Empress, 34.\r\n\r\n  Caule, Rev.

Published November, 1910\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nThe subject of imposture is always an interesting one, and impostors\nin one shape or another are likely to flourish as long as human nature\r\nremains what it is, and society shows itself ready to be gulled.\nThe histories of famous cases of imposture in this book have been\ngrouped together to show that the art has been practised in many\nforms--impersonators, pretenders, swindlers, and humbugs of all kinds;\nthose who have masqueraded in order to acquire wealth, position, or\nfame, and those who have done so merely for the love of the art.\nSo numerous are instances, indeed, that the book cannot profess to\r\nexhaust a theme which might easily fill a dozen volumes; its purpose is\nsimply to collect and record a number of the best known instances. The\nauthor, nevertheless, whose largest experience has lain in the field of\nfiction, has aimed at dealing with his material as with the material\nfor a novel, except that all the facts given are real and authentic. He\nhas made no attempt to treat the subject ethically; yet from a study of\nthese impostors, the objects they had in view, the means they adopted,","the risks they ran, and the punishments which attended exposure, any\nreader can draw his own conclusions.\n\nImpostors of royalty are placed first on account of the fascinating\nglamour of the throne which has allured so many to the attempt. Perkin\nWarbeck began a life of royal imposture at the age of seventeen and\nyet got an army round him and dared to make war on Harry Hotspur\nbefore ending his short and stormy life on the gallows. With a crown\r\nfor stake, it is not surprising that men have been found willing to\nrun even such risks as those taken by the impostors of Sebastian\nof Portugal and Louis XVII of France. That imposture, even if\nunsuccessful, may be very difficult to detect, is shown in the cases of\nPrincess Olive and Cagliostro, and in those of Hannah Snell, Mary East,\nand the many women who in military and naval, as well as in civil, life\nassumed and maintained even in the din of battle the simulation of men.\r\nOne of the most extraordinary and notorious impostures ever known was\nthat of Arthur Orton, the Tichborne Claimant, whose ultimate exposure\nnecessitated the employment, at great public expense of time and\nmoney, of the best judicial and forensic wits in a legal process of\nunprecedented length.\n\nThe belief in witches, though not extinct in our country even to-day,\naffords examples of the converse of imposture, for in the majority of\r\ncases it was the superstitions of society which attributed powers of\nevil to innocent persons whose subsequent mock-trials and butchery\nmade a public holiday for their so-called judges.\n\nThe long-continued doubt as to the true sex of the Chevalier D’Eon\nshows how a belief, no matter how groundless, may persist. Many cases\nof recent years may also be called in witness as to the initial\ncredulity of the public, and to show how obstinacy maintains a belief\r\nso begun. The Humbert case--too fresh in the public memory to demand\ntreatment here--the Lemoine case, and the long roll of other fraudulent\nefforts to turn the credulity of others to private gain, show how\nwidespread is the criminal net, and how daring and persevering are its\nmanipulators.\n\nThe portion of the book which deals with the tradition of the “Bisley\nBoy” has had, as it demanded, more full and detailed treatment than\nany other one subject in the volume. Needless to say, the author","was at first glance inclined to put the whole story aside as almost\nunworthy of serious attention, or as one of those fanciful matters\nwhich imagination has elaborated out of the records of the past. The\nwork which he had undertaken had, however, to be done, and almost from\nthe very start of earnest enquiry it became manifest that here was\na subject which could not be altogether put aside or made light of.\nThere were too many circumstances--matters of exact record, striking\r\nin themselves and full of some strange mystery, all pointing to a\nconclusion which one almost feared to grasp as a possibility--to allow\nthe question to be relegated to the region of accepted myth. A little\npreliminary work amongst books and maps seemed to indicate that so far\nfrom the matter, vague and inchoate as it was, being chimerical, it was\none for the most patient examination. It looked, indeed, as if those\r\nconcerned in making public the local tradition, which had been buried\nor kept in hiding somewhere for three centuries, were on the verge of\na discovery of more than national importance. Accordingly, the author,\nwith the aid of some friends at Bisley and its neighbourhood, went over\nthe ground, and, using his eyes and ears, came to his own conclusions.\nFurther study being thus necessitated, the subject seemed to open\nout in a natural way. One after another the initial difficulties\r\nappeared to find their own solutions and to vanish; a more searching\ninvestigation of the time and circumstances showed that there was\nlittle if any difficulty in the way of the story being true in essence\nif not in detail. Then, as point after point arising from others\nalready examined, assisted the story, probability began to take the\nplace of possibility; until the whole gradually took shape as a chain,\nlink resting in the strength of link and forming a cohesive whole. That\r\nthis story impugns the identity--and more than the identity--of Queen\nElizabeth, one of the most famous and glorious rulers whom the world\nhas seen, and hints at an explanation of circumstances in the life of\nthat monarch which have long puzzled historians, will entitle it to the\nmost serious consideration. In short, if it be true, its investigation\nwill tend to disclose the greatest imposture known to history; and to\nthis end no honest means should be neglected.","B.

PRETENDERS\n\n\n\n\nFAMOUS IMPOSTORS\n\n\n\n\nA. PERKIN WARBECK\n\n\nRichard III literally carved his way to the throne of England. It would\nhardly be an exaggeration to say that he waded to it through blood.\nAmongst those who suffered for his unscrupulous ambition were George\nDuke of Clarence, his own elder brother, Edward Prince of Wales, who on\nthe death of Edward IV was the natural successor to the English throne,\r\nand the brother of the latter, Richard Duke of York. The two last\nmentioned were the princes murdered in the Tower by their malignant\nuncle. These three murders placed Richard Duke of Gloucester on the\nthrone, but at a cost of blood as well as of lesser considerations\nwhich it is hard to estimate. Richard III left behind him a legacy of\nevil consequences which was far-reaching. Henry VII, who succeeded\nhim, had naturally no easy task in steering through the many family\r\ncomplications resulting from the long-continued “Wars of the Roses”;\nbut Richard’s villany had created a new series of complications on\na more ignoble, if less criminal, base. When Ambition, which deals\nin murder on a wholesale scale, is striving its best to reap the\nresults aimed at, it is at least annoying to have the road to success\nlittered with the débris of lesser and seemingly unnecessary crimes.\nFraud is socially a lesser evil than murder; and after all--humanly\r\nspeaking--much more easily got rid of. Thrones and even dynasties were\nin the melting pot between the reigns of Edward III and Henry VII; so\nthere were quite sufficient doubts and perplexities to satisfy the\nenergies of any aspirant to royal honours--however militant he might\nbe. Henry VII’s time was so far unpropitious that he was the natural\nbutt of all the shafts of unscrupulous adventure. The first of these\ncame in the person of Lambert Simnel, the son of a baker, who in 1486","set himself up as Edward Plantagenet, Earl of Warwick--then a prisoner\nin the Tower--son of the murdered Duke of Clarence. It was manifestly\na Yorkist plot, as he was supported by Margaret Duchess Dowager of\nBurgundy (sister of Edward IV) and others. With the assistance of the\nLord-Deputy (the Earl of Kildare) he was crowned in Dublin as King\nEdward VI. The pretensions of Simnel were overthrown by the exhibition\r\nof the real Duke of Warwick, taken from prison for the purpose. The\nattempt would have been almost comic but that the effects were tragic.\nSimnel’s span of notoriety was only a year, the close of which was\nattended with heavy slaughter of his friends and mercenaries. He\nhimself faded into the obscurity of the minor life of the King’s\nhousehold to which he was contemptuously relegated. In fact the whole\nsignificance of the plot was that it was the first of a series of\r\nfrauds consequent on the changes of political parties, and served as a\n_balon d’essai_ for the more serious imposture of Perkin Warbeck some\nfive years afterwards. It must, however, be borne in mind that Simnel\nwas a pretender on his own account and not in any way a “pacemaker” for\nthe later criminal; he was in the nature of an unconscious forerunner,\nbut without any ostensible connection. Simnel went his way, leaving,\nin the words of the kingly murderer his uncle, the world free for his\r\nsuccessor in fraud “to bustle in.”\n\n[Illustration: PERKIN WARBECK]\n\nThe battle of Stoke, near Newark--the battle which saw the end of the\nhopes of Simnel and his upholders--was fought on 16 June, 1487. Five\nyears afterwards Perkin Warbeck made his appearance in Cork as Richard\nPlantagenet Duke of York. The following facts regarding him and his\nlife previous to 1492 may help to place the reader in a position to\nunderstand other events and to find causes through the natural gateway\r\nof effects.\n\nTo Jehan Werbecque (or Osbeck as he was called in Perkin’s\n“confession”), Controller of the town of Tournay in Picardy, and his\nwife, _née_ Katherine de Faro, was born in 1474, a son christened\nPierrequin and later known as Perkin Warbeck. The Low Countries in the\nfifteenth century were essentially manufacturing and commercial, and,\nas all countries were at that period of necessity military, growing\nyouths were thus in touch at many points with commerce, industry and","war. Jehan Werbecque’s family was of the better middle class, as\nwitness his own position and employment; and so his son spent the\nearlier years of his life amid scenes and conditions conducive to\nambitious dreams. He had an uncle John Stalyn of Ghent. A maternal aunt\nwas married to Peter Flamme, Receiver of Tournay and also Dean of the\nGuild of Schelde Boatmen. A cousin, John Steinbeck, was an official of\nAntwerp.\r\nIn the fifteenth century Flanders was an important region in the\nmanufacturing and commercial worlds. It was the centre of the cloth\nindustry; and the coming and going of the material for the clothing of\nthe world made prosperous the shipmen not only of its own waters but\nthose of others. The ships of the pre-Tudor navy were small affairs\nand of light draught suitable for river traffic, and be sure that the\nSchelde with its facility of access to the then British port of Calais,\r\nto Lille, to Brussels, to Bruges, to Tournai, Ghent, and Antwerp, was\noften itself a highway to the scenes of Continental and British wars.\n\nAbout 1483 or 1484, on account of the Flemish War, Pierrequin left\nTournay, proceeding to Antwerp, and to Middleburg, where he took\nservice with a merchant, John Strewe, he being then a young boy of ten\nor twelve. His next move was to Portugal, whither he went with the wife\nof Sir Edward Brampton, an adherent of the House of York. A good deal\r\nof his early life is told in his own confession made whilst he was a\nprisoner in the Tower about 1497.\n\nIn Portugal he was for a year in the service of a Knight named Peter\nVacz de Cogna, who, according to a statement in his confession, had\nonly one eye. In the Confession he also states in a general way that\nwith de Cogna he visited other countries. After this he was with a\nBreton merchant, Pregent Meno, of whom he states incidentally: “he made\r\nme learn English.” Pierrequin Werbecque must have been a precocious\nboy--if all his statements are true--for when he went to Ireland in\n1491 with Pregent Meno he was only seventeen years of age, and there\nhad been already crowded into his life a fair amount of the equipment\nfor enterprise in the shape of experience, travel, languages, and so\nforth.\n\nIt is likely that, to some extent at all events, the imposture of","Werbecque, or Warbeck, was forced on him in the first instance, and\nwas not a free act on his own part. His suitability to the part he\nwas about to play was not altogether his own doing. Nay, it is more\nthan possible that his very blood aided in the deception. Edward IV\nis described as a handsome debonair young man, and Perkin Warbeck it\nis alleged, bore a marked likeness to him. Horace Walpole indeed in\nhis _Historic Doubts_ builds a good deal on this in his acceptance of\r\nhis kingship. Edward was notoriously a man of evil life in the way of\naffairs of passion, and at all times the way of ill-doing has been\nmade easy for a king. Any student of the period and of the race of\nPlantagenet may easily accept it as fact that the trend of likelihood\nif not of evidence is that Perkin Warbeck was a natural son of Edward\nIV. Three hundred years later the infamous British Royal Marriage\nAct made such difficulties or inconveniences as beset a king in the\r\nposition of Edward IV unnecessary: but in the fifteenth century the\nusual way out of such messes was ultimately by the sword. Horace\nWalpole, who was a clever and learned man, was satisfied that the\nperson who was known as Perkin Warbeck was in reality that Richard Duke\nof York who was supposed to have been murdered in the Tower in 1483\nby Sir James Tyrrell, in furtherance of the ambitious schemes of his\nuncle. At any rate the people in Cork in 1491 insisted on receiving\r\nPerkin as of the House of York--at first as a son of the murdered\nDuke of Clarence. Warbeck took oath to the contrary before the Mayor\nof Cork; whereupon the populace averred that he was a natural son of\nRichard III. This, too, having been denied by the newcomer, it was\nstated that he was the son of the murdered Duke of York.\n\nIt cannot be denied that the Irish people were in this matter as\nunstable as they were swift in their judgments, so that their actions\r\nare really not of much account. Five years before they had received\nthe adventurer Lambert Simnel as their king, and he had been crowned\nat Dublin. In any case the allegations of Warbeck’s supporters did\nnot march with established facts of gynecology. The murdered Duke of\nYork was born in 1472, and, as not twenty years elapsed between this\nperiod and Warbeck’s appearance in Ireland, there was not time in the\nordinary process of nature, for father and son to have arrived at","such a quality of manhood that the latter was able to appear as full\ngrown. Even allowing for an unusual swiftness of growth common sense\nevidently rebelled at this, and in 1492 Perkin Warbeck was received in\nhis final semblance of the Duke of York, himself younger son of Edward\nIV. Many things were possible at a period when the difficulties of\nvoyage and travel made even small distances insuperable. At the end of\nthe fifteenth century Ireland was still so far removed from England\r\nthat even Warbeck’s Irish successes, emphasised though they were by the\nEarls of Desmond and Kildare and a numerous body of supporters, were\nunknown in England till considerably later. This is not strange if one\nwill consider that not until centuries later was there a regular postal\nsystem, and that nearly two centuries later the Lord Chief Justice\nSir Matthew Hale, who was a firm believer in witchcraft, would have\ncondemned such a thing as telegraphy as an invention of the Devil.\r\nIn the course of a historical narrative like the present it must be\nborne in mind (amongst other things) that in the fifteenth century,\nmen ripened more quickly than in the less strenuous and more luxurious\natmosphere of our own day. Especially in the Tudor epoch physical gifts\ncounted for far more than is now possible; and as early (and too often\nsudden) death was the general lot of those in high places, the span of\r\nworking life was prolonged rather by beginning early than by finishing\nlate. Even up to the time of the Napoleonic Wars, promotion was often\nwon with a rapidity that would seem like an ambitious dream to young\nsoldiers of to-day. Perkin Warbeck, born in 1474, was nineteen years of\nage in 1493, at which time the Earl of Kildare spoke of “this French\nlad,” yet even then he was fighting King Henry VII, the Harry Richmond\nwho had overthrown at Bosworth the great and unscrupulous Richard III.\r\nIt must also be remembered for a proper understanding of his venture,\nthat Perkin Warbeck was strongly supported and advised with great\nknowledge and subtlety by some very resolute and influential persons.\nAmongst these, in addition to his Irish “Cousins” Kildare and Desmond,\nwas Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy, sister of Edward IV, who helped the\nyoung adventurer in his plot by “coaching” him up in the part which\nhe was to play, to such an extent that, according to Lord Bacon, he","was familiar with the features of his alleged family and relatives and\neven with the sort of questions likely to be asked in this connection.\nIn fact he was, in theatrical parlance, not only properly equipped\nbut “letter-perfect” in his part. Contemporary authority gives as\nan additional cause for this personal knowledge, that the original\nJehan de Warbecque was a converted Jew, brought up in England, of\nwhom Edward IV was the godfather. In any case it may in this age be\r\naccepted as a fact that there was between Edward IV and Perkin Warbeck\nso strong a likeness as to suggest a _prima facie_ possibility, if\nnot a probability, of paternity. Other possibilities crowd in to the\nsupport of such a guess till it is likely to achieve the dimensions of\na belief. Even without any accuracy of historical detail there is quite\nsufficient presumption to justify guess-work on general lines. It were\r\na comparatively easy task to follow the lead of Walpole and create a\nnew “historic doubt” after his pattern, the argument of which would run\nthus:\n\nAfter the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury in 1471, Edward IV had\nbut little to contend against. His powerful foes were all either\ndead or so utterly beaten as to be powerless for effective war. The\nLancastrian hopes had disappeared with the death of Henry VI in the\nTower. Margaret of Anjou (wife of Henry VI) defeated at Tewkesbury,\r\nwas in prison. Warwick had been slain at Barnet, and so far as fighting\nwas concerned, King Edward had a prolonged holiday. It was these years\nof peace--when the coming and going of even a king was unrecorded with\nthat precision which marks historical accuracy--that made the period\nantecedent to Perkin’s birth. Perkin bore an unmistakable likeness to\nEdward IV. Not merely that resemblance which marks a family or a race\r\nbut an individual likeness. Moreover the young manhood of the two ran\non parallel lines. Edward was born in 1442, and in 1461, before he\nwas nineteen, won the battle of Mortimer’s Cross which, with Towton,\nplaced him on the throne. Perkin Warbeck at seventeen made his bid for\nroyalty. It is hardly necessary to consider what is a manifest error\nin Perkin’s Confession--that he was only nine years old, not eleven,\nat the time of the murder of Edward V. Nineteen was young enough in","all conscience to begin an intrigue for a crown; but if the Confession\nis to be accepted as gospel this would make him only seventeen at the\ntime of his going to Ireland--a manifest impossibility. Any statement\nregarding one’s own birth is manifestly not to be relied on. At best\nsuch can only be an assertion _minus_ the possibility of testing whence\nan error might come. Regarding his parentage, in case it may be alleged\nthat there is no record of the wife of Jehan Warbecque having been\r\nin England, it may be allowed to recall a story which Alfred, Lord\nTennyson used to say was amongst the hundred best stories. It ran thus:\n\n    A noble at the Court of Louis XIV was extremely like the King,\n    who on its being pointed out to him sent for his double and asked\n    him:\n\n    “Was your mother ever at Court?”\n\n    Bowing low, he replied:\n\n    “No, sire; but my father was!”\n\nOf course Perkin Warbeck’s real adventures, in the sense of dangers,\r\nbegan after his claim to be the brother of Edward V was put forward.\nHenry VII was not slow in taking whatever steps might be necessary\nto protect his crown; there had been but short shrift for Lambert\nSimnel, and Perkin Warbeck was a much more dangerous aspirant. When\nCharles VIII invited him to Paris, after the war with France had broken\nout, Henry besieged Boulogne and made a treaty under which Perkin\nWarbeck was dismissed from France. After making an attempt to capture\r\nWaterford, the adventurer transferred the scene of his endeavours\nfrom Ireland to Scotland which offered him greater possibilities for\nintrigue on account of the struggles between James IV and Henry VII.\nJames, who finally found it necessary to hasten his departure, seemed\nto believe really in his pretensions, for he gave him in marriage\na kinswoman of his own, Catherine Gordon, daughter of the Earl of\nHuntly--who by the way was re-married no less than three times after\r\nPerkin Warbeck’s death. Through the influence of Henry VII, direct\nor indirect, Perkin had to leave Scotland as he had been previously\nforced from Burgundy and the Low Countries. Country after country\nhaving been closed to him, he made desperate efforts in Cornwall, where\nhe captured St. Michael’s Mount, and in Devon, where he laid siege\nto Exeter. This however being raised by the Royal forces, he sought\nsanctuary in Beaulieu in the New Forest where, on promise of his life,","he surrendered. He was sent to the Tower and well treated; but on\nattempting to escape thence a year later, 1499, he was taken. He was\nhanged at Tyburn in the same year.\n\nPierrequin Warbecque’s enterprise was in any case a desperate one\nand bound to end tragically--unless, of course, he could succeed\nin establishing his (alleged) claim to the throne in law and then\nin supporting it at great odds. The latter would necessitate his\r\nvanquishing two desperate fighting men both of them devoid of fear or\nscruples--Richard III and Henry VII. In any case he had the Houses of\nLancaster, Plantagenet and Tudor against him and he fought with the\nrope round his neck.\n\nAn Act of Parliament, 1 Richard III, Cap. 15, made at Westminster\non the 23 Jan., 1485, precluded all possibility--even if Warbeck\nshould have satisfied the nation of his identity--of a legal claim to\r\nthe throne, for it forbade any recognition of the offspring of Lady\nElizabeth Grey to whom Edward IV was secretly married, in May, 1464,\nthe issue of which marriage were Edward V and his brother, Richard. The\nact is short and is worth reading, if only for its quaint phraseology.\n\n  _Cap XV._ Item for certayn great causes and consideracions\n    touchynge the suretye of the kynges noble persone as of this\n    realme, by the advyce and assente of his lordes spirituall and\r\ntemporal, and the commons in this present parliament assembled,\n    and by the auctorite of the same.

THE HIDDEN KING\r\nThe personality, nature and life of Sebastian, King of Portugal,\nlent themselves to the strange structure of events which followed\nhis strenuous and somewhat eccentric and stormy life. He was born in\n1554, and was the son of Prince John and his wife Juana, daughter of\nthe Emperor Charles V. He succeeded his grandfather, John III, at\nthe age of three. His long minority aided the special development\nof his character. The preceptor appointed to rule his youth was a\r\nJesuit, Luiz-Goncalvoz de Camara. Not unnaturally his teacher used his\nposition to further the religious aims and intrigues of his strenuous\nOrder. Sebastian was the kind of youth who is beloved by his female\nrelatives--quite apart from his being a King; and naturally he was\ntreated by the women in a manner to further his waywardness. When he\nwas fourteen years old he was crowned. From thence on he insisted on\nhaving his way in everything, and grew into a young manhood which was\r\nof the type beloved of an adventurous people. He was thus described:\n\n“He was a headstrong violent nature, of reckless courage, of boundless\nambition founded on a deep religious feeling. At the time of his\ncoronation he was called ‘Another Alexander.’ He loved all kinds of\ndanger, and found a keen pleasure in going out in a tempest in a small\nboat and in actually running under the guns of his own forts where his\r\ncommands were stringent that any vessel coming in shore should be fired\non. He was a notable horseman and could steer his charger efficiently\nby the pressure of either knee--indeed he was of such muscular vigour\nthat he could, by the mere stringency of the pressure of his knees,\nmake a powerful horse tremble and sweat. He was a great swordsman, and\nquite fearless. ‘What is fear?’ he used to say. Restless by nature he\nhardly knew what it was to be tired.”","And yet this young man--warrior as he was, had a feminine cast of\nface; his features were symmetrically formed with just sufficient\ndroop in the lower lip to give the characteristic ‘note’ of Austrian\nphysiognomy. His complexion was as fine and transparent as a girl’s;\nhis eyes were clear and of blue; his hair of reddish gold. His height\nwas medium, his figure fine; he was vigorous and active. He had an\nair of profound gravity and stern enthusiasm. Altogether he was, even\r\nwithout his Royal state, just such a young man as might stand for the\nidol of a young maid’s dream.\n\nAnd yet he did not seem much of a lover. When, in 1576, he entered\nSpain to meet Philip II at Guadaloupe to ask the hand of the Infanta\nIsabella in marriage, he was described as “cold as a wooer as he\nwas ardent as a warrior.” His eyes were so set on ambition that mere\nwoman’s beauty did not seem to attract him. Events--even that event,\r\nthe meeting--fostered his ambition. When he knelt to his host, the\nelder king kissed him and addressed him as “Your Majesty” the first\ntime the great title had been used to a Portuguese king. The effect\nmust have come but little later for at that meeting he kissed the\nhand of the old warrior, the Duke of Alva, and uncovered to him. His\nunderlying pride, however, was shewn at the close of that very meeting,\nfor he claimed equal rights in formality with the Spanish king; and\r\nthere was a danger that the visit of ceremony might end worse than it\nbegan. Neither king would enter the carriage in which they were to\nproceed together, until the host suggested that as there were two doors\nthey should enter at the same time.\n\nSebastian’s religious fervour and military ambition became one when\nhe conceived the idea of renewing the Crusades; he would recover the\nHoly Land from the dominion of the Paynim and become himself master of\r\nMorocco in the doing of it. With the latter object in his immediate\nview, he made in 1574, against the wise counsels of Queen Catherine,\na _sortie de reconnaissance_ of the African coast; but without any\nresult--except the fixing of his resolution to proceed. In 1578 his\nscheme was complete. He would listen to no warning or counsel on the\nsubject even from the Pope, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, or the Duke of\nNassau. He seemed to foresee the realization of his dreams, and would","forego nothing. He gathered an army of some 18,000 men (of which less\nthan 2,000 were horsemen) and about a dozen cannon. The preparation was\nmade with great splendour--a sort of forerunner of the Great Armada. It\nseemed to be, as in the case of the projected invasion of England ten\nyears later by Spain, a case of “counting the chickens before they were\nhatched.”\n\nSome indication of the number of adventurers and camp followers\naccompanying the army is given by the fact that the 800 craft ordained\r\nfor the invasion of Morocco carried in all some 24,000 persons,\ninclusive of the fighting men. The paraphernalia and officials of\nvictory comprised amongst many other luxuries: lists for jousts, a\ncrown ready for the new King of Morocco to put on, and poets with\ncompleted poems celebrating victory.\n\nAt this time Morocco was entering on the throes of civil war. Muley\nAbd-el-Mulek, the reigning Sultan, was opposed by his nephew, Mohammed,\r\nand to aid the latter, who promised to bring in 400 horsemen, was the\nimmediate object of Sebastian. But the fiery young King of Portugal had\nundertaken more than he was able to perform. Abd-el-Mulek opposed his\n18,000 Portuguese with 55,000 Moors, (of whom 36,000 were horsemen)\nand with three times his number of cannon. The young Crusader’s\ngeneralship was distinctly defective; he was a fine fighting man, but\na poor commander. Instead of attacking at once on his arrival and so\r\nputting the zeal of his own troops and the discouragement of the enemy\nto the best advantage, he wasted nearly a week in hunting parties and\nineffectual manœuvring. When finally issue was joined, Abd-el-Mulek,\nthough he was actually dying, surrounded the Portuguese forces and cut\nthem to pieces. Sebastian, though he fought like a lion, and had three\nhorses killed under him, was hopelessly beaten. There was an attendant\r\npiece of the grimmest comedy on record. The Sultan died during the\nbattle, but he was a stern old warrior, and as he fell back in his\nlitter he put his finger on his lip to order with his last movement\nthat his death should be kept secret for the time being. The officer\nbeside him closed the curtains and went on with the fight, pretending\nto take orders from the dead man and to transmit them to the captains.\n\nThe fate of Sebastian was sealed in that battle. Whether he lived or","died, he disappeared on 5 August, 1578. One story was that after the\nbattle of Alcaçer-el-Kebir, his body stripped and showing seven wounds\nwas found in a heap of the slain; that it was taken to Fez and there\nburied; but was afterwards removed to Europe and found resting place\nin the Convent of Belen. Another story was that after a brilliant\ncharge on his enemies he was taken in, but having been rescued by Lui\nde Brito he escaped unpursued. Certainly no one seemed to have seen\r\nthe King killed, and it was strange that no part of his clothing or\naccoutrements was ever found. These were of great splendour, beauty and\nworth, and must have been easily traceable. There was a rumour that on\nthe night following the battle some fugitives, amongst whom was one of\ncommanding distinction, sought refuge at Arzilla.\n\nAlcaçer-el-Kebir was known as the “Battle of the three Kings.” All the\nprincipals engaged in it perished. Sebastian was killed or disappeared.\r\nAbd-el-Mulek died as we have seen, and Mohammed was drowned in trying\nto cross the river.\n\nThe dubiety of Sebastian’s death gave rise in after years to several\nimpostures.\n\nThe first began six years after Sebastian’s successor--his uncle,\nCardinal Henry--was placed on the throne. The impostor was known as the\n“King of Penamacor.” The son of a potter at Alcobaca, he established\nhimself at Albuquerque, within the Spanish borders, somewhat to the\r\nnorth of Badajos, and there gave himself out as “a survivor of the\nAfrican Campaign.” As usual the public went a little further and said\nopenly that he was the missing Don Sebastian. At first he denied the\nsoft impeachment, but later on the temptation became too great for him\nand he accepted it and set up in Penamacor, where he became known as\nthe “King of Penamacor.” He was arrested and paraded through Lisbon,\nbareheaded, as if to let the public see that he in no way resembled the\r\npersonality of Sebastian. He was sent to the galleys for life. But he\nmust have escaped, for later on he appeared in Paris as Silvio Pellico,\nDuke of Normandy, and was accepted as such in many of the salons in the\nexclusive Faubourg St. Germain.\n\nThe second personator of Sebastian was one Matheus Alvares, who having\nfailed to become a monk, a year later imitated the first impostor, and\nin 1585 set up a hermitage at Ericeira. He bore some resemblance to the","late king in build, and in the strength of this he boldly gave himself\nout as “King Sebastian” and set out for Lisbon. But he was arrested\nby the way and entered as a prisoner. He was tried and executed with\nfrightful accessories to the execution.\n\nThe third artist in this imposture appeared in 1594. He was a Spaniard\nfrom Madrigal in Old Castile--a cook, sixty years old (Sebastian would\nhave been just forty if he had lived). When arrested he was given but\r\nshort shrift and shared the same ghastly fate as his predecessor.\n\nThe fourth, and last, imposture was more serious. This time the\npersonator began in Venice in 1598, calling himself “Knight of the\nCross.”\n\nAs twenty years had now elapsed since the disappearance of Sebastian,\nhe would have changed much in appearance, so in one respect the\npersonator had less to contend against. Moreover the scene of endeavour\nwas this time laid in Venice, a place even more widely removed in the\r\nsixteenth century from Lisbon by circumstances than by geographical\nposition. Again witnesses who could give testimony to the individuality\nof the missing King of twenty years ago were few and far between. But\non the other hand the new impostor had new difficulties to contend\nagainst. Henry, the Cardinal, had only occupied the Portuguese throne\ntwo years, for in 1580 Philip II of Spain had united the two crowns,\nand had held the dual monarchy for eighteen years. He was a very\r\ndifferent antagonist from any one that might be of purely Portuguese\norigin.\n\nIn the eyes of many of the people--like all the Latin races naturally\nsuperstitious--one circumstance powerfully upheld the impostor’s\nclaim. So long ago as 1587, Don John de Castro had made a seemingly\nprophetic statement that Sebastian was alive and would manifest himself\nin due time. His utterance was, like most such prophecies of the\r\nkind, “conducive to its own fulfilment;” there were many--and some of\nthem powerful--who were willing at the start to back up any initiator\nof such a claim. In his time Sebastian had been used, so far as it\nwas possible to use a man of his temperament and position, by the\nintriguers of the Catholic Church, and the present occasion lent itself\nto their still-existent aims. Rome was very powerful four centuries\nago, and its legions of adherents bound in many ties, were scattered","throughout the known world. Be sure these could and would aid in any\nmovement or intrigue which could be useful to the Church.\n\n“The Knight of the Cross”--who insinuated, though he did not state\nso, that he was a Royal person was arrested on the showing of the\nSpanish Ambassador. He was a born liar, with all the readiness which\nthe carrying out of such an adventure as he had planned requires. Not\nonly was he well posted in known facts, but he seemed to be actually\r\nproof against cross-examination. The story he told was that after the\nbattle of Alcaçer-el-Kebir he with some others, had sought temporary\nrefuge in Arzilla and in trying to make his way from there to the East\nIndies, he had got to “Prester John’s” land--the semi-fabled Ethiopia\nof those days. From thence he had been turned back, and had, after\nmany adventures and much wandering--in the course of which he had been\r\nbought and sold a dozen times or more, found his way, alone, to Venice.\nAmongst other statements he alleged that Sebastian’s confessor had\nalready recognised and acknowledged him; but he was doubtless ignorant,\nwhen he made the statement, that Padre Mauricio, Don Sebastian’s\nconfessor, fell with his king in 1578. Two things, one, a positive\ninference and the other negative, told against him. He only knew of\nsuch matters as had been made public in depositions, and _he did not\r\nknow Portuguese_. The result of his first trial was that he was sent to\nprison for two years.\n\nBut those two years of prison improved his case immensely. In that\ntime he learned the Portuguese language and many facts of history.\nOne of the first to believe--or to allege belief, in his story, Fray\nEstevan de Sampayo, a Dominican monk, was in 1599, sent by the Venetian\nauthorities to Portugal to obtain an accredited description of the\r\npersonal marks of King Sebastian. He returned within a year with a\nlist of sixteen personal marks--attested by an Apostolic notary.\nStrange to say the prisoner exhibited every one of them--a complete\nagreement which in itself gave rise to the new suspicion that the list\nhad been made out by, or on behalf of, the prisoner. The proof however\nwas accepted--for the time; and he was released on the 28th of July,\n1600--but with the imperative, humiliating proviso that he was to quit","Venice within four and twenty hours under penalty of being sent to\nthe galleys. A number of his supporters, who met him before he went,\nfound that he had in reality no sort of resemblance to Sebastian. Don\nJohn de Castro, who was amongst them, said that a great change in\nSebastian seemed to have taken place. (He had prophesied and adhered\nto his prophecy.) He now described him as a man of medium height and\npowerful frame, with hair and beard of black or dark brown, and said\r\nhe had completely lost his beauty. “What has become of my fairness?”\nthe swarthy ex-prisoner used to say. He had eyes of uncertain colour,\nnot large but sparkling; high cheek bones; long nose; thin lips with\nthe “Hapsburg droop” in the lower one. He was short from the waist\nup. (Sebastian’s doublet would fit no other person.) His right leg\nand arm were longer than the left, the legs being slightly bowed like\nSebastian’s. He had small feet with extraordinarily high insteps; and\r\nlarge hands. “In fine,” Don John summed up illogically, “he is the\nself-same Sebastian--except for such differences as resulted from years\nand labours.” Some other particulars he added which are in no way\nhelpful to a conclusion.\n\nThe Impostor told his friends that he had in 1597, sent a messenger\nfrom Constantinople to Portugal--one Marco Tullio Catizzone--who had\nnever returned. Thence he had travelled to Rome--where, when he was\r\njust on the eve of being presented to the Holy Father, he was robbed of\nall he had; thence to Verona and so on to Venice. After his expulsion\nfrom Venice he seems to have found his way to Leghorn and Florence, and\nthence on to Naples, where he was handed over to the jurisdiction of\nthe Spanish Viceroy, the Count of Lemos, who had visited him in prison,\nand who well remembered King Sebastian whom he had seen when in a\ndiplomatic mission. The Viceroy came to the conclusion that he bore no\r\nlikeness at all to Sebastian, that he was ignorant of all save the well\nknown historical facts that had been published, and that his speech\nwas of “corrupt Portuguese mingled with tell-tale phrases of Calabrian\ndialect.” Thereupon he took active steps against him. One witness who\nwas produced, recognized in him the real Marco Tullio Catizzone, and\nCount de Lemos sent for his wife, mother-in-law and brother-in-law,\nall of whom he had deceived and deserted. His wife, Donna Paula of","Messina, acknowledged him; and he confessed his crime. Condemned to the\ngalleys for life, Marco Tullio, out of consideration of a possibility\nof an error of justice, was so far given indulgence by the authorities\nthat he did not have to wear prison dress or labour at the oar. Many\nof his supporters, who still believed in him, tried to mitigate his\nlot and treated him as a companion; so that the hulk at San Lucar, at\r\nthe mouth of the Guadalquiver became a minor centre of intrigue. But\nstill he was not content, and adventuring further, he tried to get\nmoney from the wife of Medina-Sidonia then Governor of Andalusia. He\nwas again arrested with some of his associates. Incriminating documents\nwere found on him. He was racked and confessed all. And so in his real\nname and parentage, Marco Tullio, son of Ippolit Catizzone of Taverna,\nand of Petronia Cortes his wife, and husband of Paula Gallardetta\r\nwas executed. He had, though of liberal education, never worked at\nany occupation or calling; but he had previously to his great fraud,\npersonated other men--amongst them Don Diego of Arragon. On 23rd of\nSeptember, 1603, he was dragged on a hurdle to the Square of San Lucar;\nhis right hand was cut off and he was hanged. Five of his companions,\nincluding two priests, shared his fate.\n\nBut in a way he and the previous impostors had a sort of posthumous\r\nrevenge, for Sebastian had now entered into the region of Romantic\nBelief. He was, like King Arthur, the ideal and the heart of a great\nmyth. He became “The Hidden King” who would some day return to aid his\nnation in the hour of peril--the destined Ruler of the Fifth Monarchy,\nthe founder of an universal Empire of Peace.\n\nA hundred years ago, the custom in British theatres was to finish\nthe evening’s performance with a farce. On this occasion the tragedy\r\nhad been finished two centuries before the “comic relief” came. The\noccasion was in the French occupation of Portugal in 1807. The strange\nbelief in the Hidden King broke out afresh. A rigorous censorship\nof Sebastianist literature was without avail--even though its\ndisseminators were condemned by the still-existing Inquisition. The old\nprophecy was renewed, with a local and personal application--Napoleon\nwas to be destroyed in the Holy Week of 1808, by the waiting Sebastian,","whose approach from his mysterious retreat was to be veiled with a\nthick fog. There were to be new portents; the sky was to be emblazoned\nwith a cross of the Order of Aviz, and on March 19th a full moon was\nto occur during the last quarter. All these things were foretold in an\n_egg_, afterwards sent by Junot to the National Museum. The general\nattitude of the French people towards the subject was illustrated by\na remark in an ironical manner of one writer: “what can be looked for\r\nfrom a people, one half of whom await the Messiah, the other half Don\nSebastian?” The authority on the subject of King Sebastian, M. d’Antas,\nrelates that as late as 1838, after the crushing of a Sebastianist\ninsurrection in Brazil certain still believing Sebastianists were to\nbe seen along the coast peering through the fog for the sails of the\nmythical ship which was to bring to them the Hidden King who was then\nto reveal himself.\r\nC. “STEFAN MALI”\n\nTHE FALSE CZAR\n\n\nStefan Mali (Stephen the Little) was an impostor who passed himself\noff in Montenegro as the Czar Peter III of Russia, who was supposed\nto have been murdered in 1762. He appeared in the Bocche di Cattaro\nin 1767. No one seemed to know him or to doubt him; indeed after he\nhad put forth his story he did not escape identification. One witness\nwho had accompanied a state visit to Russia averred that he recognized\r\nthe features of the Czar whom he had seen in St. Petersburg. Like all\nadventurers Stefan Mali had good personal resources. An adventurer,\nand especially an adventurer who is also an impostor, must be an\nopportunist; and an opportunist must be able to move in any direction\nat any time; therefore he must be always ready for any emergency. The\ntime, the place, and the circumstances largely favoured the impostor\nin this case. It is perhaps but fair to credit him with foreknowledge,\r\nintention, and understanding of all that he did. In after years he\njustified himself in this respect and showed distinctly that he was a\nman of brains and capable of using them. He was no doubt not only able\nto sustain at the start his alleged personality, but also to act under\nnew conditions and in new circumstances as they developed themselves,\nas a man of Czar Peter’s character and acquired knowledge might have","done. Cesare Augusto Levi, who is the authority on this subject, says,\nin his work “_Venezia e il Montenegro_”: “He was of fine presence and\nwell proportioned form and of noble ways. He was so eloquent that he\nexercised with mere words a power not only on the multitude but also on\nthe higher classes.... He must certainly have been in St. Petersburg\nbefore he scaled Montenegro; and have known the true Peter III, for\nhe imitated his voice and his gestures--to the illusionment of the\r\nMontenegrins. There is no certainty of such a thing, but he must,\nin the belief of the Vladika Sava have been a descendant of Stefano\nCzernovich who reigned after Giorgio IV.”\n\nAt that time Montenegro was ruled by Vladika Sava, who having spent\nsome twenty years in monastic life, was unfitted for the government of\na turbulent nation always harassed by the Turks and always engaged in\na struggle for bare existence. The people of such a nation naturally\r\nwanted a strong ruler, and as they were discontented under the sway of\nSava the recognition of Stefan Mali was almost a foregone conclusion.\nHe told a wonderful story of his adventures since his reported death--a\nstory naturally interesting to such an adventurous people; and as he\nstated his intention of never returning to Russia, they were glad to\nadd such a new ally to their fighting force for the maintenance of\ntheir independence. As the will of the people was for the new-comer,\r\nthe Vladika readily consented to confine himself to his spiritual\nfunctions and to allow Stefan to govern. The Vladika of Montenegro\nheld a strange office--one which combined the functions of priest and\ngeneralissimo--so that the new division of the labour of ruling was\nrather welcome than otherwise to the people of a nation where no man\never goes without arms. Stephen--as he now was--governed well. He\ndevoted himself fearlessly to the punishment of ill-doing, and early\r\nin his reign had men shot for theft. He established Courts of Justice\nand tried to further means of communication throughout the little\nkingdom, which, is, after all, little more than a bare rock. He even\nso far impinged on Sava’s sacred office as to prohibit Sunday labour.\nIn fact his labours so much improved the outlook of the Montenegrins\nthat the result brought trouble on himself as well as on the nation in\ngeneral. Hitherto, whatever foreign nations may have believed as to the","authenticity of Stephen’s claim, they had deliberately closed their\neyes to his new existence, so long as under his rule the little nation\nof Montenegro did not become a more dangerous enemy to all or any of\nthem.\n\nBut the nations interested grew anxious at the forward movement in\nMontenegro. Venice, then the possessor of Dalmatia, was alarmed,\nand Turkey regarded the new ruler as an indirect agent of Russia.\nTogether they declared war. This was the moment when Fate declared\r\nthat the Pretender should show his latent weakness of character. The\nMontenegrins are naturally so brave that cowardice is unknown amongst\nthem; but Stephen did not dare to face the Turkish army, which attacked\nMontenegro on all the land sides. But the Montenegrins fought on till\na chance came to them after many months of waiting in the shape of a\nfearful storm which desolated their enemies’ Camp. By a sudden swoop\r\non the camp they seized much ammunition of which they were sadly in\nwant and by the aid of which they gained delivery from their foes.\nThe Russian government seemed then to wake up to the importance of\nthe situation, and, after sending the Montenegrins much help in the\nshape of war material, asked them to join again in the war against the\nTurks. The Empress Catherine in addition to this request, sent another\nletter denouncing Stephen as an impostor. He admitted the charge and\r\nwas put in prison. But in the impending war a strong man was wanted\nat the head of affairs; and Sava, who now had the mundane side of\nhis dual office once more thrust again upon him, was a weak one. The\nsituation was saved by Prince George Dolgourouki, the representative\nof the Empress Catherine, who, with statesmanlike acumen, saw that\nsuch a desperate need required an exceptional remedy. He recognized the\nfalse Czar as Regent. Stephen Mali, thus restored to power under such\r\npowerful auspices, once more governed Montenegro until 1774, when he\nwas murdered by the Greek player Casamugna--by order, it is said, of\nthe Pasha of Scutari, Kara Mahmound.\n\nBy the irony of Fate this was exactly the way in which the real Czar,\nwhose personality he had assumed, had died some dozen years before.\n\nThis impostor was perhaps the only one who in the history of nations\nprospered finally in his fraud. But as may be seen he was possessed of","higher gifts than most of his kind; he was equal to the emergencies\nwhich presented themselves--and circumstances favoured him, rarely.\n\n\n\n\nD. THE FALSE DAUPHINS\n\n\nOn 21 January, 1793, Louis XVI of France was beheaded in the Place de\nla Revolution, formerly Place de Louis Quinze. From the moment his head\nfell, his only son the Dauphin became by all constitutional usage, his\nsuccessor, Louis XVII. True the child-king was in the hands of his\r\nenemies; but what mattered that to believers in the “Divine Right.”\nWhat mattered it either that he was at that moment in the prison of\nthe Temple, where he had languished since August 13, 1792, already\nconsecrated to destruction, in one form or another. He was then under\neight years of age, and so an easy victim. His gaoler, one Simon, had\nalready been instructed to bring him up as a “sansculotte.” In the\nfurtherance of this dreadful ordinance he was taught to drink and swear\r\nand to take a part in the unrighteous songs and ceremonies of the Reign\nof Terror. Under such conditions no one can be sorry that death came to\nhis relief. This was in June, 1795--he being then in his eleventh year.\nIn the stress and turmoil of such an overwhelming cataclysm as the\nRevolution, but little notice was taken of a death which, under other\ncircumstances, would undoubtedly have been of international interest\nif not of importance. But by this time the death of any one, so long as\r\nit was by violence, was too common a matter to cause concern to others.\nThe Terror had practically glutted the lust for blood. Under such\nconditions but little weight was placed on the accuracy of records; and\nto this day there survive practical inconveniences and difficulties\nin daily life from the then disruption of ordered ways. The origin of\nsuch frauds or means of fraud as are now before us is in uncertainty.\nShakespeare says:\n\n    “How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds\r\nMakes ill deeds done.”\n\nThe true or natural criminal is essentially an opportunist. The\nintention of crime, even if it be only a desire to follow the line\nof least resistance, is a permanent factor in such lives, but the\ndirection, the mechanism, and the scope of the crime are largely the\nresult of the possibilities which open and develop themselves from a\nfore-ordered condition of things.\n\n[Illustration: EDWARD IV AS A YOUNG MAN]","Here then was the opening which presented itself at the end of the\neighteenth century. France was in a state of social chaos. The\nfountains of the deep were stirred, and no human intelligence could\ndo more than guess at what might result from any individual effort of\nself-advancement. The public conscience was debauched, and for all\npractical purposes the end justified the means. It was an age of\ndesperate adventure, of reckless enterprise, of unscrupulous methods.\r\nThe Royalty of France was overthrown--in abeyance till at least such\na time as some Colossus of brains or energy, or good fortune, should\nset it up again. The hopes of a great nation of return to a settled\norder of things through constitutional and historical channels were\ncentred in the succession to the Crown. And through the violence of the\nupheaval any issue was possible. The state of affairs just before the\ndeath of Louis XVII gave a chance of success to any desperate fraud.\r\nThe old King was dead, the new King was a child and in the hands of his\nbitterest enemies. Even if anyone had cared to vindicate his rights\nthere seemed at present no way of accomplishing this object. To any\nreckless and unscrupulous adventurer here was an unique chance. Here\nwas a kingship going: a daring hand might grasp the crown which rested\nin so perilous a manner on the head of a baby. Moreover the events of\nthe last fifteen years of the century had not only begotten daring\r\nwhich depended on promptness, but had taught and fostered desperation.\nIt is a wonder to us who look back on that time through the\nsafety-giving mist of a century, not that there was any attempt to get\na crown, if only by theft, but that there were not a hundred attempts\nmade for each one that history has recorded.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there were seven attempts made to personate the\ndead Dauphin, son of Louis XVI, that “son of St. Louis,” who, in\r\nobedience to Abbé Edgworth’s direction to “ascend to heaven,” went\nsomewhere where it is difficult--or perhaps inexpedient--to follow him.\n\nThe first pretender appears to have been one Jean Marie Hervagault, son\nof a tailor. His qualification for the pretence appears to have been\nbut a slender one, that of having been born in 1781, only about three\nyears before the Dauphin. This, taken by itself, would seem to be but\na poor equipment for such a crime; but in comparison with some of the","later claimants it was not without reason of approximate possibility as\nfar as date was concerned. It was not this criminal’s first attempt at\nimposture, for he had already pretended to be a son of la Vaucelle of\nLongueville and of the Duc d’Ursef. Having been arrested at Hottot as a\nvagabond, he was taken to Cherburg, where he was claimed by his father.\nWhen claiming to be, like the old man in Mark Twain’s inimitable\r\n_Huckleberry Finn_, “the late Dauphin,” his story was that he had as\na child been carried from the prison of the Temple in a basket of\nlinen. In 1799 he was imprisoned at Chalons-sur-Marne for a month. He\nwas, however, so far successful in his imposture as Louis XVII, that\nafter some adventures he actually achieved a good following--chiefly\nof the landed interest and clerics. He was condemned to two years’\nimprisonment at Vitry, and afterwards to a term of twice that duration,\r\nduring which he died, in 1812.\n\nThe second and third aspirants to the honour of the vacant crown were\ninconspicuous persons possessing neither personal qualification nor\napparent claim of any sort except that of a desire for acquisition. One\nwas Persat, an old soldier; the other, Fontolive, a bricklayer. The\npretence of either of these men would have been entirely ridiculous but\nfor its entirely tragic consequences. There is short shrift for the\r\nunsuccessful impostor of royalty--even in an age of fluctuation between\nrebellion and anarchy.\n\nThe fourth pretender was at least a better workman at crime than his\npredecessors. This was Mathurin Brunneau--ostensibly a shoemaker\nbut in reality a vagabond peasant from Vezins, in the department of\nMaine-et-Loire. He was a born criminal as was shown by his early\nrecord. When only eleven years of age he claimed to be the son of the\r\nlord of the village, Baron de Vezins. He obtained the sympathy of the\nCountess de Turpin de Crisse, who seemed to have compassion for the\nboy. Even when the fraud of his parentage was found out she took him\nback into her household--but amongst the servants. After this his life\nbecame one of adventure. When he was fifteen he made a tour through\nFrance. In 1803 he was put in the House of Correction at St. Denis. In\n1805 he enlisted as a gunner. In 1815 he re-appeared with an American","passport bearing the name of Charles de Navarre. His more ambitious\nattempt at personation in 1817, was not in the long run successful.\nHe claimed his rights, as “Dauphin” Bourbon under Louis XVIII, was\narrested at St. Malo, and confined at Bicêtre. He got round him a\ngang of persons of evil life, as shown by their various records. One\nwas a false priest, another a prisoner for embezzlement, another an\nex-bailiff who was also a forger, another a deserter; with the usual\r\ncriminal concomitant of women, dishonoured clergy and such like. At\nRouen he was sentenced to pay a fine of three thousand francs in\naddition to imprisonment for seven years. He died in prison.\n\nThe imposture regarding the Dauphin was like a torch-race--so soon\nas the lighted torch fell from the hand of one runner it was lifted\nby him who followed. Brunneau, having disappeared into the prison at\nRouen, was succeeded by Henri Herbert who made a dramatic appearance in\r\nAustria in 1818. At the Court in Mantone, the scene of his appearance,\nhe gave the name of Louis Charles de Bourbon, Duc de Normandie.\nHis account of himself, given in his book published in 1831, and\nrepublished--with enlargements, by Chevalier del Corso in 1850, is\nwithout any respect at all for the credulity of his readers.\n\nThe story tells how an alleged doctor, one answering to the not common\nname of Jenais-Ojardias, some time before the death of the Dauphin had\r\nhad made a toy horse of sufficient size to contain the baby king, the\nopening to the interior of which was hidden by the saddle-cloth. The\nwife of the gaoler Simon, helped in the plot, the carrying out of which\nwas attempted early in 1794. Another child about the Dauphin’s size,\ndying or marked for death by fatal disease, was drugged and hidden\nin the interior. When the toy horse was placed in the Dauphin’s cell\nthe children were exchanged, the little king having also been drugged\r\nfor the purpose. It would almost seem that the narrator here either\nlost his head or was seized with a violent _cacoethes scribendi_, for\nhe most unnecessarily again lugs in the episode adapted from Trojan\nhistory. The worthy doctor of the double name had another horse\nmanufactured, this time of life size. Into the alleged entrails of\nthis animal, which was harnessed with three real horses as one of a\nteam of four, the Dauphin, once more drugged, was concealed. He was","borne to refuge in Belgium, where he was placed under the protection\nof the Prince de Condé. By this protector he was, according to his\nstory, sent to General Kléber who took him to Egypt as his nephew under\nthe name of Monsieur Louis. After the battle of Marengo in 1800, he\nreturned to France, where he confided his secret to Lucien Bonaparte\nand to Fouché (the Minister of Police), who got him introduced to the\r\nEmpress Josephine, who recognised him by a scar over his right eye. In\n1804 (still according to his story), he embarked for America and got\naway to the banks of the Amazon, where amid the burning deserts (as\nhe put it) he had adventures capable of consuming lesser romancists\nwith envy. Some of these adventures were amongst a tribe called “the\nMamelucks”--which name was at least reminiscent of his alleged Egyptian\nexperiences. From the burning deserts on the banks of the Amazon he\r\nfound his way to Brazil, where a certain “Don Juan,” late of Portugal\nand at that time Regent of Brazil, gave him asylum.\n\nLeaving the hospitable home of Don Juan, he returned to Paris in 1815.\nHere Condé introduced him to the Duchesse d’Angoulême (his sister!)\nand according to his own naïve statement “the Princess was greatly\nsurprised,” as indeed she might well have been--quite as much as the\nwitch of Endor was by the appearance of Samuel. Having been repulsed\r\nby his (alleged) sister, the alleged king made a little excursion,\nembracing in its erratic course Rhodes, England, Africa, Egypt, Asia\nMinor, Greece, and Italy. When in Austria he met Silvio Pellico in\nprison. Having spent some years himself in prison in the same country,\nhe went to Switzerland. Leaving Geneva in 1826, he entered France,\nunder the name of Herbert. He was in Paris the following year under\r\nthe name of “Colonel Gustave,” and forthwith revived his fraud of being\n“the late Dauphin.” In 1828, he appealed to the Chamber of Peers. To\nthis appeal he appears to have received no direct reply; but apropos\nof it, Baron Mounier made a proposition to the Chamber that in future\nno such application should be received unless properly signed and\nattested and presented by a member of the Chamber. He gathered round\nhim some dupes who believed in him. To these he told a number of","strange lies based on some form of perverted truth, but always taking\ncare that those of whom he spoke were already dead. Amongst them was\nthe wife of Simon, who had died in 1819. Desault, the surgeon, who\nhad medical care of Louis XVII, and who died in 1795, the ex-Empress\nJosephine, who died in 1814, General Pichegru, who died in 1804, and\nthe Duc de Bourbon (Prince de Condé) who died in 1818. In the course\nof his citation of the above names, he plays havoc with generally\r\naccepted history--Desault according to him did not die naturally but\nwas poisoned. Josephine died simply because she knew the secret of\nthe young King’s escape. Pichegru died from a similar cause and not\nby suicide. Fualdes was assassinated, but it was because he knew the\nfatal secret. With regard to one of his dead witnesses whose name was\nThomas-Ignace-Martin de Gallardon, there is a rigmarole which would not\nbe accepted in the nursery of an idiot asylum. There is a mixture of\r\nPagan mythology and Christian hagiology which would have been condemned\nby Ananias himself. In one passage he talks of seeing suddenly before\nhim--he could not tell (naturally enough) whence he came--a sort of\nangel who had wings, a long coat and a _high hat_. This supernatural\nperson ordered the narrator to tell the King that he was in danger,\nand the only way to avoid it was to have a good police and to keep the\nSabbath. Having given his message the visitant rose in the air and\r\ndisappeared. Later on the suggested angel told him to communicate with\nthe Duc Decazes. The Duke naturally, and wisely enough, handed the\ncredulous peasant over to the care of a doctor. Martin himself died,\npresumably by assassination, in 1834.\n\nThe Revolution of 1830 awoke the pretensions of Herbert, who now\nappeared as the Baron de Richmont, and wrote to the Duchesse\nd’Angoulême, his (supposed) sister, putting on her the blame of all\r\nhis troubles. But the consequences of this effort were disastrous to\nhim. He was arrested in August, 1833. After hearing many witnesses the\nCourt condemned him to imprisonment for twelve years. He was arraigned\nunder the name of “Ethelbert Louis-Hector-Alfred,” calling himself the\n“Baron de Richmont.” He escaped from Clairvaux, whither he had been\ntransferred from Saint-Pélagie, in 1835. In 1843 and 1846 he published\nhis memoirs--enlarged but omitting some of his earlier assertions,","which had been disproved. He returned to France after the amnesty of\n1840. In 1848 he appealed--unheeded--to the National Assembly. He died\nin 1855 at Gleyze.\n\nThe sixth “Late Dauphin” was a Polish Jew called Naundorf--an impudent\nimpostor not even seeming suitably prepared by time for the part\nwhich he had thus voluntarily undertaken, having been born in 1775,\nand thus having been as old at the birth of the Dauphin as the latter\r\nwas when he died. This individual had appeared in Berlin in 1810,\nand was married in Spandau eight years later. He had been punished\nfor incendiarism in 1824, and later got three years’ imprisonment\nat Brandenburg for coining. He may be considered as a fairly good\nall-round--if unsuccessful--criminal. In England he was imprisoned for\ndebt. He died in Delft in 1845.\n\nThe last attempt at impersonating Louis XVII, the seventh, afforded\r\nwhat might in theatrical parlance be called the “comic relief” of the\nwhole series, both as regards means and results. This time the claimant\nto the Kingship of France was none other than a half-bred Iroquois, one\ncalled Eleazar, who appeared to be the ninth son of Thomas Williams,\notherwise Thorakwaneken, and an Indian woman, Mary Ann Konwatewentala.\nThis lady, who spoke only Iroquois, said at the opportune time she was\n_not_ the mother of Lazar (Iroquois for Eleazar). She made her mark as\r\nshe could not write. Eleazar had been almost an idiot till the age\nof thirteen; but, being struck on the head by a stone, recovered his\nmemory and intelligence. He said he remembered sitting on the knees of\na beautiful lady who wore a rich dress with a train. He also remembered\nseeing in his childhood a terrible person; shewn the picture of Simon\nhe recognised him with terror. He learned English but imperfectly,\nbecame a Protestant and a missionary and married. His profile was\r\nsomething like that of the typical Bourbon. In 1841, the Prince de\nJoinville, seeing him on his travels in the United States, told him\n(according to Eleazar’s account) that he was the son of a king, and got\nhim to sign and seal a parchment, already prepared, the same being a\nsolemn abdication of the Crown of France in favour of Louis Philippe,\nmade by Charles Louis, son of Louis XVI, also styled Louis XVII King of\nFrance and Navarre. The seal used was the seal of France, the one used","by the old Monarchy. The “poor Indian with untutored mind” made with\ncharming diffidence the saving clause regarding the seal,--“if I am not\nmistaken.” Of course there was in the abdication a clause regarding\nthe payment of a sum of money “which would enable me to live in great\nluxury in this country or in France as I might choose.” The Reverend\nEleazar, despite his natural disadvantages and difficulties, was\nmore fortunate than his fellow claimants inasmuch as the time of his\r\nimposture was more propitious. Louis Philippe, who was always anxious\nto lessen the danger to his tottering throne, made a settlement on him\nfrom his Civil List, and the “subsequent proceedings interested him no\nmore.”\n\nAltogether the Louis XVII impostures extended over a period of some\nsixty years, beginning with Hervagault’s pretence soon after the death\nof the Dauphin, and closing at Gleyze with the death of Henri Herbert,\r\nthe alleged Baron de Richmont who appeared as the alleged Duc de\nNormandie.\n\n\n\n\nE. PRINCESS OLIVE\n\n\nThe story of Mrs. Olive Serres, as nature made it, was one thing; it\nwas quite another as she made it for herself. The result, before the\nstory was completely told, was a third; and, compared with the other,\none of transcendent importance. Altogether her efforts, whatsoever\nthey were and crowned never so effectively, showed a triumph in its\r\nway of the thaumaturgic art of lying; but like all structures built\non sand it collapsed eventually. In the plain version--nature’s--the\nfacts were simply as follows. She, and a brother of no importance, were\nthe children of a house painter living in Warwick, one Robert Wilmot,\nand of Anna Maria his wife. Having been born in 1772 she was under\nage when in 1791 she was married, the ceremony therefore requiring\nlicence supported by bond and affidavit. Her husband was John Thomas\r\nSerres who ten years later was appointed marine painter to King George\nIII. Mr. and Mrs. Serres were separated in 1804 after the birth of two\ndaughters, the elder of whom, born in 1797, became in 1822 the wife\nof Antony Thomas Ryves a portrait painter--whom she divorced in 1847.\nMrs. A. T. Ryves twelve years later filed a petition praying that the\nmarriage of her mother, made in 1791, might be declared valid and she\nherself the legitimate issue of that marriage. The case was heard in","1861, Mrs. Ryves conducting it in person. Having produced sufficient\nevidence of the marriage and the birth, and there being no opposition,\nthe Court almost as a matter of course pronounced the decree asked for.\nIn this case no complications in the way of birth or marriage of Mrs.\nSerres were touched on.\n\nRobert Wilmot, the house-painter, had an elder brother James who became\na Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and went into the Church, taking\r\nhis degree of Doctor of Divinity. Through his College he was presented\nin 1781 to the living of Barton-on-the-heath, Warwickshire. The\nStatutes of his College contained a prohibition against marriage whilst\na Fellow. James Wilmot D. D. died in 1807 leaving his property between\nthe two children of Robert, after life-use by his brother. James and\nRobert Wilmot had a sister Olive, who was born in 1728 and married in\n1754 to William Payne with issue one daughter, Olivia, born in 1759.\r\nRobert Wilmot died in 1812.\n\n[Illustration: OLIVIA SERRES]\n\nOut of these rough materials Mrs. Olive Serres set herself in due\ncourse to construct and carry out, as time and opportunity allowed,\nand as occasions presented themselves and developed, a fraudulent\nromance in real life and action. She was, however, a very clever\nwoman and in certain ways--as was afterwards proved by her literary and\nartistic work--well dowered by nature for the task--crooked though it\r\nwas--which she set for herself. Her ability was shown not only by what\nshe could do and did at this time of her life, but by the manner in\nwhich she developed her natural gifts as time went on. In the sum of\nher working life, in which the perspective of days becomes merged in\nthat of years, she touched on many subjects, not always of an ordinary\nkind, which shewed often that she was of conspicuous ability, having\r\nbecome accomplished in several branches of art. She was a painter of\nsufficient merit to have exhibited her work in the Royal Academy in\n1794 and to be appointed landscape-painter to the Prince of Wales in\n1806. She was a novelist, a press writer, an occasional poet and in\nmany ways of a ready pen. She was skilled in some forms of occultism,\nand could cast horoscopes; she wrote, in addition to a pamphlet on\nthe same subject, a book on the writings of Junius, claiming to have","discovered the identity of the author--none other than James Wilmot\nD. D. She wrote learnedly on disguised handwriting. In fact she touched\non the many phases of literary effort which come within the scope of\nthose who live by the work of their brains. Perhaps, indeed, it was\nher facility as a writer that helped to lead her astray; for in her\npractical draughtsmanship and in her brain teeming with romantic ideas\nshe found a means of availing herself of opportunities suggested by\r\nher reckless ambition. Doubtless the cramped and unpoetic life of her\nhumble condition in the house-painter’s home in Warwick made her fret\nand chafe under its natural restraint. But when she saw her way to\nan effective scheme of enlarging her self-importance she acted with\nextraordinary daring and resource. As is usual with such natures,\nwhen moral restraints have been abandoned, the pendulum swung to\nits opposite. As she had been lowly she determined to be proud; and\r\nhaving fixed on her objective began to elaborate a consistent scheme,\nutilising the facts of her own surroundings as the foundation of her\nimposture. She probably realised early that there must be a base\nsomewhere, and so proceeded to manufacture or arrange for herself a new\nidentity into which the demonstrable facts of her actual life could be\nwrought. At the same time she manifestly realised that in a similar\r\nway fact and intention must be interwoven throughout the whole of\nher contemplated creation. Accordingly she created for herself a new\n_milieu_ which she supported by forged documents of so clever a conceit\nand such excellent workmanship, that they misled all who investigated\nthem, until they came within the purview of the great lawyers of the\nday whose knowledge, logical power, skill and determination were\narrayed against her. By a sort of intellectual metabolism she changed\r\nthe identities and conditions of her own relations whom I have\nmentioned, always taking care that her story held together in essential\npossibilities, and making use of the abnormalities of those whose\nprototypes she introduced into fictional life.\n\nThe changes made in her world of new conditions were mainly as follows:\nHer uncle, the Reverend James, who as a man of learning and dignity\nwas accustomed to high-class society, and as a preacher of eminence","occasionally in touch with Crown and Court, became her father; and she\nherself the child of a secret marriage with a great lady whose personal\nrank and condition would reflect importance on her daughter. But proof,\nor alleged proof, of some kind would be necessary and there were too\nmany persons at present living whose testimony would be available\nfor her undoing. So her uncle James shifted his place and became\nher grandfather. To this the circumstances of his earlier life gave\r\ncredibility in two ways; firstly because they allowed of his having\nmade a secret marriage, since he was forbidden to marry by the statutes\nof his college, and secondly because they gave a reasonable excuse for\nconcealing his marriage and the birth of a child, publicity regarding\nwhich would have cost him his livelihood.\n\nAt this point the story began to grow logically, and the whole scheme\nto expand cohesively. Her genius as a writer of fiction was being\r\nproved; and with the strengthening of the intellectual nature came\nthe atrophy of the moral. She began to look higher; and the seeds of\nimagination took root in her vanity till the madness latent in her\nnature turned wishes into beliefs and beliefs into facts. As she was\nimagining on her own behoof, why not imagine beneficially? This all\ntook time, so that when she was well prepared for her venture things\nhad moved on in the nation and the world as well as in her fictitious\r\nromance. Manifestly she could not make a start on her venture until\nthe possibility vanished of witnesses from the inner circle of her\nown family being brought against her; so that she could not safely\nbegin machinations for some time. She determined however to be ready\nwhen occasion should serve. In the meantime she had to lead two lives.\nOutwardly she was Olive Serres, daughter of Robert Wilmot born in 1772\nand married in 1791, and mother of two daughters. Inwardly she was\r\nthe same woman with the same birth, marriage and motherhood, but of\ndifferent descent being (imaginatively) grand-daughter of her (real)\nuncle the Rev. James Wilmot D. D. The gaps in the imaginary descent\nhaving been thus filled up as made and provided in her own mind, she\nfelt more safe. Her uncle--so ran her fiction--had early in his college\nlife met and become friends with Count Stanislaus Poniatowski who later\nbecame by election King of Poland. Count Poniatowski had a sister--whom","the ingenious Olive dubbed “Princess of Poland”--who became the wife\nof her uncle (now her grandfather) James. To them was born, in 1750,\na daughter Olive, the marriage being kept secret for family reasons,\nand the child for the same reason being passed off as the offspring of\nRobert the housepainter. This child Olive, according to the fiction,\nmet His Royal Highness Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland, brother\nof the King, George III. They fell in love with each other and were\r\nprivately married--by the Rev. James Wilmot D. D.--on 4 March 1767.\nThey had issue one daughter, Olive, born at Warwick 3 April 1772. After\nliving with her for four years the Duke of Cumberland deserted his\nwife, who was then pregnant, and in 1771 married--bigamously, it was\nalleged--Lady Anne Horton, sister of Colonel Luttrell, daughter of Lord\nIrnham, and widow of Andrew Horton of Catton, Derbyshire. The (alleged)\r\nRoyal Duchess died in France in 1774, and the Duke in 1790.\n\nThus fact and fiction were arrayed together in a very cunning way.\nThe birth of Olive Wilmot (afterwards Serres) in 1772 was proved by a\ngenuine registry. Likewise that of her daughter Mrs. Ryves. For all the\nrest the certificates were forged. Moreover there was proof of another\nOlive Wilmot whose existence, supported by genuine registration, might\r\navert suspicion; since it would be difficult to prove after a lapse of\ntime that the Olive Wilmot born at Warwick in 1772 daughter of Robert\n(the house-painter), was not the granddaughter of James (the Doctor of\nDivinity). In case of necessity the real date (1759) of the birth of\nOlive Wilmot sister of the Rev. James could easily be altered to the\nfictitious date of the birth of “Princess” Olive born 1750.\n\nIt was only in 1817 that Mrs. Serres began to take active measures for\r\ncarrying her imposture into action; and in the process she made some\ntentative efforts which afterwards made difficulty for her. At first\nshe sent out a story, through a memorial to George III, that she was\ndaughter of the Duke of Cumberland by Mrs. Payne, wife of Captain Payne\nand sister of James Wilmot D. D. This she amended later in the same\nyear by alleging that she was a natural daughter of the Duke by the\nsister of Doctor Wilmot, whom he had seduced under promise of marriage.","It was not till after the deaths of George III and the Duke of Kent in\n1820, that the story took its third and final form.\n\nIt should be noticed that care was taken not to clash with laws already\nin existence or to run counter to generally received facts. In 1772 was\npassed the Royal Marriage Act (12 George III Cap. 11) which nullified\nany marriage contracted with anyone in the succession to the Crown to\nwhich the Monarch had not given his sanction. Therefore Mrs. Serres\r\nhad fixed the (alleged) marriage of (the alleged) Olive Wilmot with\nthe Duke of Cumberland as in 1767--five years earlier--so that the\nAct could not be brought forward as a bar to its validity. Up to 1772\nsuch marriages could take place legally. Indeed there was actually a\ncase in existence--the Duke of Gloucester (another brother of the King)\nhaving married the dowager Countess of Waldegrave. It was of common\nrepute that this marriage was the motive of the King’s resolve to have\r\nthe Royal Marriage Act added to the Statute book. At the main trial it\nwas alleged by Counsel, in making the petitioner’s claim, that the King\n(George III) was aware of the Duke of Cumberland’s marriage with Olive\nWilmot, although it was not known to the public, and that when he heard\nof his marriage with Lady Anne Horton he was very angry and would not\nallow them to come to Court.\n\nThe various allegations of Mrs. Serres as to her mother’s marriage were\r\nnot treated seriously for a long time but they were so persisted in\nthat it became necessary to have some denial in evidence. Accordingly a\nlaw-case was entered. One which became a _cause célèbre_. It began in\n1866--just about a hundred years from the time of the alleged marriage.\nWith such a long gap the difficulties of disproving Mrs. Serres’\nallegations were much increased. But there was no help for it; reasons\nof State forbade the acceptance or even the doubt of such a claim. The\r\nreally important point was that if by any chance the claimant should\nwin, the Succession would be endangered.\n\nThe presiding judge was the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Cockburn. With\nhim sat Lord Chief Baron Pollock and the Judge Ordinary Sir James\nWilde. There was a special jury. The case took the form of one in the\nEnglish Probate Court made under the “Legitimacy Declaration Act.” In\nthis case, Mrs. Ryves, daughter of Mrs. Serres, was the petitioner.","Associated with her in the claim was her son, who, however, is of no\ninterest in the matter and need not be considered. The petition stated\nthat Mrs. Ryves was the legitimate daughter of one John Thomas Serres\nand Olive his wife, the said Olive being, whilst living, a natural-born\nsubject and the legitimate daughter of Henry Frederick, Duke of\nCumberland and Olive Wilmot, his wife. That the said Olive Wilmot, born\nin 1750, was lawfully married to His Royal Highness Henry Frederick,\r\nDuke of Cumberland, fourth son of Frederick Prince of Wales (thus being\ngrandson of George II and brother of King George III), on 4 March 1767,\nat the house of Thomas, Lord Archer, in Grosvenor Square, London, the\nmarriage being performed by the Rev. James Wilmot D. D., father of the\nsaid Olive Wilmot. That a child, Olive, was born to them on 3 April\n1772, who in 1791 was married to John Thomas Serres. And so on in\naccordance with the (alleged) facts above given.\r\nThe strange position was that even if the petitioner should win her\nmain case she would prove her own illegitimacy. For granting that the\nalleged Olive Serres should have been legally married to the Duke of\nCumberland, the Royal Marriage Act, passed five years later, forbade\nthe union of the child of such a marriage, except with the sanction of\nthe reigning monarch.\n\nIn the making of the claim of Mrs. Ryves a grave matter appeared--one\r\nwhich rendered it absolutely necessary that the case should be heard\nin the most formal and adequate way and settled once for all. The\nmatter was one affecting the legality of the marriage of George III,\nand so touching the legitimacy of his son afterwards George IV, his son\nafterwards William IV and his son the Duke of Kent, father of Queen\nVictoria--and so debarring them and all their descendants from the\nCrown of England. The points of contact were in documents insidiously\r\nthough not overtly produced and the preparation of which showed much\nconstructive skill in the world of fiction. Amongst the many documents\nput in evidence by the Counsel for Mrs. Ryves were two certificates of\nthe (alleged) marriage between Olive Wilmot and the Duke of Cumberland.\nOn the back of each of these alleged certificates was written what\npurported to be a certificate of the marriage of George III to Hannah\nLightfoot performed in 1759 by J. Wilmot. The wording of the documents","varied slightly.\n\nIt was thus that the claim of Mrs. Ryves and her son became linked\nup with the present and future destinies of England. These alleged\ndocuments too, brought the Attorney General upon the scene. There\nwere two reasons for this. Firstly the action had to be taken against\nthe Crown in the matter of form; secondly in such a case with the\npossibility of such vast issues it was absolutely necessary that every\r\nposition should be carefully guarded, every allegation jealously\nexamined. In each case the Attorney General was the proper official to\nact.\n\nThe Case of the Petitioners was prepared with extraordinary care.\nThere were amongst the documents produced, numbering over seventy,\nsome containing amongst them forty-three signatures of Dr. Wilmot,\nsixteen of Lord Chatham, twelve of Mr. Dunning (afterwards the 1st\nBaron Ashburton), twelve of George III, thirty-two of Lord Warwick and\r\neighteen of H.R.H., the Duke of Kent, the father of Queen Victoria.\nTheir counsel stated that although these documents had been repeatedly\nbrought to the notice of the successive Ministers of the Crown, it had\nnever been suggested until that day that they were forgeries. This\nlatter statement was traversed in Court by the Lord Chief Baron, who\ncalled attention to a debate on the subject in the House of Commons in\nwhich they were denounced as forgeries.\r\nIn addition to those documents already quoted were the following\ncertificates:\n\n    “The marriage of these parties was this day duly solemnized at\n    Kew Chapel, according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church\n    of England, by myself.\n\n            “J. Wilmot.”\n\n      “George P.”\n      “Hannah.”\n\n    Witness to this marriage\n\n      “W. Pitt.”\n      “Anne Taylor.”\n\n            May 27, 1759.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n            April 17, 1759\r\n“This is to Certify that the marriage of these parties (George,\n    Prince of Wales, to Hannah Lightfoot) was duly solemnized this\n    day, according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of\n    England, at their residence at Peckham, by myself.\n\n            “J. Wilmot.”\n\n      “George Guelph.”\n      “Hannah Lightfoot.”\n\n    Witness to the marriage of these parties,--\n\n  “William Pitt.”\n  “Anne Taylor.”\n\n       *       *       *       *       *","“I hereby Certify that George, Prince of Wales, married Hannah\n    Wheeler _alias_ Lightfoot, April 17, 1759, but from finding the\n    latter to be her right name I solemnized the union of the said\n    parties a second time May the 27th, 1759, as the Certificate\n    affixed to this paper will confirm.\n\n      “J. Wilmot.\n      Witness (Torn)”\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe case for the Crown was strongly supported. Not only did the\r\nAttorney-General, Sir Roundell Palmer (afterwards Lord Chancellor\nand First Earl of Selborne) appear himself, but he was supported by\nthe Solicitor-General, the Queen’s Advocate, Mr. Hannen and Mr. R.\nBourke. The Attorney-General made the defence himself. At the outset\nit was difficult to know where to begin, for everywhere undoubted and\nunchallenged facts were interwoven with the structure of the case; and\nof all the weaknesses and foibles of the important persons mentioned,\r\nfull advantage was taken. The marriage of the Duke of Gloucester to\nLady Waldegrave had made him unpopular in every way, and he was at the\ntime a _persona ingrata_ at Court. There had been rumours of scandal\nabout the King (when Prince of Wales) and the “Fair Quaker,” Hannah\nLightfoot. The anonymity of the author of the celebrated “Letters of\nJunius,” which attacked the King so unmercifully, lent plausibility to\nany story which might account for it. The case of Mrs. Ryves, tried\r\nin 1861, in which her own legitimacy had been proved and in which\nindisputable documents had been used, was taken as a proof of her _bona\nfides_.\n\nMrs. Ryves herself was in the box for nearly the whole of three days,\nduring which she bore herself firmly, refusing even to sit down when\nthe presiding judge courteously extended that privilege to her. She\nwas then, by her own statement, over seventy years of age. In the\r\ncourse of her evidence a Memorial to George IV was produced, written\nby her mother, Mrs. Serres, in which the word offspring was spelled\n“orfspring”; in commenting on which the Attorney-General produced a\ncongratulatory Ode to the Prince Regent on his birthday in 1812, by the\nsame author, in which occurred the line:\n\n“Hail valued heir orfspring of Heaven’s smile.” Similar eccentric\northography was found in other autograph papers of Mrs. Serres.","The Attorney-General, in opposing the claim, alleged that the whole\nstory of the Duke of Cumberland’s marriage to Olive Wilmot was a\nconcoction from beginning to end, and said that the mere statement of\nthe Petitioner’s case was sufficient to stamp its true character. That\nits folly and absurdity were equal to its audacity; in every stage\nit exposed itself to conviction by the simplest tests. He added that\nthe Petitioner might have dwelt so long upon documents produced and\r\nfabricated by others, that, with her memory impaired by old age, the\nprinciple of veracity might have been poisoned, and the offices of\nimagination and memory confounded to such an extent that she really\nbelieved that things had been done and said in her presence which were\nin fact entirely imaginary. No part of her story was corroborated\nby a single authentic document, or by a single extrinsic fact. The\nforgery, falsehood and fraud of the case were proved in many ways. The\r\nexplanations were as false and feeble as the story itself. “I cannot\nof course,” he said, “lay bare the whole history of the concoction\nof these extraordinary documents, but there are circumstances which\nindicate that they were concocted by Mrs. Serres herself.”\n\nHaving commented on some other matters spoken of, but regarding which\nno evidence was adduced, he proceeded to speak of the alleged wife of\nJoseph Wilmot D. D., the Polish Princess, sister of Count Poniatowski,\r\nafterwards elected King of Poland (1764), who was the mother of his\ncharming daughter, Olive. “The truth is,” said Sir Roundell, “that\nboth the Polish Princess and the charming daughter were pure myths;\nno such persons ever existed--they were as entirely creatures of the\nimagination as Shakespeare’s Ferdinand and Miranda.”\n\nAs to the documents produced by the Petitioners he remarked:\n\n    “What sort of documents were those which were produced? The\r\ninternal evidence proved that they were the most ridiculous,\n    absurd, preposterous series of forgeries that the perverted\n    ingenuity of man ever invented ... they were all written on\n    little scraps and slips of paper, such as no human being would\n    ever have used for the purpose of recording transactions of this\n    kind, and it would be proved that in every one of these pieces of\n    paper the watermark of date was wanting.”","This was but a new variant of the remark made by the Lord Chief\nJustice, just after the putting-in of the alleged marriage Certificate\nof the Prince of Wales and Hannah Lightfoot:\n\n    “The Court is, as I understand, asked solemnly to declare, on the\n    strength of two certificates, coming I know not whence, written\n    on two scraps of paper, that the marriage, the only marriage of\n    George III which the world believes to have taken place, between\r\nHis Majesty and Queen Charlotte, was an invalid marriage, and\n    consequently that all the Sovereigns who have sat on the throne\n    since his death, including Her present Majesty, were not entitled\n    to sit on the throne. That is the conclusion which the Court is\n    asked to come to upon these two rubbishy pieces of paper, one\n    signed ‘George P.,’ and the other ‘George Guelph.’ I believe them\n    to be gross and rank forgeries. The Court has no difficulty in\r\ncoming to the conclusion, even assuming that the signatures had\n    that character of genuineness which they have not, that what is\n    asserted in these documents has not the slightest foundation in\n    fact.”\n\nWith this view the Lord Chief Baron and the Judge-Ordinary entirely\nconcurred, the former adding:\n\n    “... the declarations of Hannah Lightfoot, if there ever was such\n    a person, cannot be received in evidence on the faith of these\r\ndocuments ... the only issues for the jury are the issues in the\n    cause and this is not an issue in the cause, but an incidental\n    issue.... I think that these documents, which the Lord Chief\n    Justice has treated with all the respect which properly belongs\n    to them, are not genuine.”\n\nBefore the Attorney General had finished the statement of his case, he\nwas interrupted by the foreman of the jury, who said that the jury were\nunanimously of opinion that there was no necessity to hear any further\r\nevidence as they were convinced that the signatures of the documents\nwere not genuine. On this the Lord Chief Justice said:\n\n    “You share the opinion which my learned brothers and I have\n    entertained for a long time; that every one of the documents is\n    spurious.”\n\nAs the Counsel for the Petitioners had “felt it his duty to make some\nobservations to the jury before they delivered their verdict,” and had","made them, the Lord Chief Justice summed up. Towards the conclusion of\nhis summing-up he said, in speaking of the various conflicting stories\nput forth by Mrs. Serres:\n\n    “In each of the claims which she made at different times, she\n    appealed to documents in her possession by which they were\n    supported. What was the irresistible inference? Why, that\n    documents were from time to time prepared to meet the form which\n    her claims from time to time assumed.”\r\nThe jury, without hesitation, found that they were not satisfied “that\nOlive Serres, the mother of Mrs. Ryves, was the legitimate daughter of\nHenry Frederick Duke of Cumberland and Olive his wife; and they were\nnot satisfied that Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland, was lawfully\nmarried to Olive Wilmot on the 4th of March 1767....”\n\nThe case of Mrs. Serres is an instance of how a person, otherwise\ncomparatively harmless but afflicted with vanity and egotism, may be\r\nled away into evil courses, from which, had she realised their full\niniquity, she might have shrunk. The only thing outside the case we\nhave been considering, was that she separated from her husband; which\nindeed was an affliction rather than a crime. She had been married\nfor thirteen years and had borne two children, but so far as we know\nno impropriety was ever alleged against her. One of her daughters\nremained her constant companion till her twenty-second year and through\r\nher long life held her and her memory in filial devotion and respect.\nThe forethought, labour and invention which she devoted to the fraud,\nif properly and honestly used, might have won for her a noteworthy\nplace in the history of her time. But as it was, she frittered away in\ncriminal work her good opportunities and great talents, and ended her\nlife within the rules of the King’s Bench.\n\n\n\n\nII. PRACTITIONERS OF MAGIC\n\n\n\n\nPARACELSUS\r\nI feel that I ought to begin this record with an apology to the _manes_\nof a great and fearless scholar, as earnest as he was honest, as\nopen-minded as he was great-hearted. I do so because I wish to do what\nan unimportant man can after the lapse of centuries, to help a younger\ngeneration to understand what such a man as I write of can do and did\nunder circumstances not possible in times of greater enlightenment.\nThe lesson which the story can tell to thinking youth cannot be told","in vain. The greatest asset which worth has in this world is the\nirony of time. Contemporaneous opinion, though often correct, is\ngenerally on the meagre side of appreciation--practically always so\nwith regard to anything new. Such must in any case be encountered in\nmatters of the sixteenth century which being on the further side of\nan age of discovery and reform had hardened almost to the stage of\nossification the beliefs and methods of the outgoing order of things.\r\nPrejudice--especially when it is based on science and religion--dies\nhard: the very spirit whence originates a stage of progress or reform,\nmakes its inherited follower tenacious of _its_ traditions however\nshort they may be. This is why any who, in this later and more open\nminded age, may investigate the intellectual discoveries of the past,\nowe a special debt in the way of justice to the memories of those to\nwhom such fresh light is due. The name and story of the individual\r\nknown as Paracelsus--scholar, scientist, open minded thinker and\nteacher, earnest investigator and searcher for elemental truths--is\na case in point. Anyone who contents himself with accepting the\njudgment of four centuries passed upon the great Swiss thinker, who\nhad rendered famous in history his place of birth, his canton and his\nnation, would inevitably come to the conclusion that he was merely a\ncharlatan a little more clever than others of his kind; an acceptor of\r\nall manner of eccentric beliefs (including the efficacy of spirits and\ndemons in pathological cases), a drunkard, a wastrel, an evil liver,\na practiser of necromancy, an astrologer, a magician, an atheist,\nan alchemist--indeed an “ist” of all defamatory kinds within the\nterminology of the sixteenth century and of all disputatious churchmen\nand scientists who have not agreed with his theories and conclusions\never since.\r\nLet us begin with the facts of his life. His name was Theophrastus\nBombast von Hohenheim, and he was the son of a doctor living in\nEinsiedeln in the canton of Schwyz, named Wilhelm Bombast von\nHohenheim, natural son of a Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. He\nwas born in 1490. It was not uncommon for a man of that age who was\nstriving to make a name for himself, to assume some _nom de plume_\nor _de guerre_; and with such a family record as his own, it was no","wonder that on the threshold of his life the young Theophrastus did so.\nIn the light of his later achievements, we can well imagine that he\nhad some definite purpose in mind, or at least some guiding principle\nof suggestiveness, in choosing such a compound word from the Greek\nas Paracelsus (which is derived from “para,” meaning before, in the\nsense of superior to, and Celsus, the name of an Epicurean philosopher\nof the second century.) Celsus appears to have had views of great\r\nenlightenment according to the thought of his own time. Unhappily only\nfragments of his work remain, but as he was a follower of Epicurus\nafter an interval of between four and five centuries, it is possible\nto get some idea of his main propositions. Like Epicurus he stood for\nnature. He did not believe in fatalism, but he did in a supreme power.\nHe was a Platonist and held that there was no truth which was against\nnature. It is easy to see from his life and work that Theophrastus\r\nBombast von Hohenheim shared his views. His intellectual attitude\nwas that of a true scientist--denying nothing _prima facie_ but\ninvestigating all.\n\n    “There lives more faith in honest doubt,\n    Believe me, than in half the creeds.”\n\nHis father moved in 1502 to Villach in Carinthia, where he practised\nmedicine till his death in 1534. Theophrastus was a precocious boy;\nafter youthful study with his father, he entered the University of\r\nBasel when he was about sixteen, after which he prosecuted chemical\nresearches under the learned Trithemius Bishop of Sponheim who had\nwritten on the subject of the Great elixir--the common subject\nof the scientists of that day,--and at Wurzburg. From thence he\nproceeded to the great mines in the Tyrol, then belonging to the\nFugger family. Here he studied geology and its kindred branches of\nlearning--especially those dealing with effects and so far as possible\r\nwith causes--metallurgy, mineral waters, and the diseases of and\naccidents to mines and miners. The theory of knowledge which he deduced\nfrom these studies was that we must learn nature from nature.\n\nIn 1527, he returned to Basel, where he was appointed town physician.\nIt was a characteristic of his independence and of his mind, method\nand design, that he lectured in the language of the place, German,\nforegoing the Latin tongue, usual up to that time for such teaching.","He did not shrink from a bold criticism of the medical ideas and\nmethods then current. The effect of this independence and teaching was\nthat for a couple of years his reputation and his practice increased\nwonderfully. But the time thus passed allowed his enemies not only\nto see the danger for them that lay ahead, but to take such action\nas they could to obviate it. Reactionary forces are generally--if\nnot always--self-protective, without regard to the right or wrong\r\nof the matter, and Paracelsus began to find that the self-interest\nand ignorance of the many were too strong for him, and that their\nunscrupulous attacks began to injure his work seriously. He was called\nconjurer, necromancer, and many such terms of obloquy. Then what we may\ncall his “professional” enemies felt themselves strong enough to join\nin the attack. As he had kept a careful eye on the purity of medicines\nin use, the apothecaries, who, in those days worked in a smaller field\r\nthan now, and who found their commerce more productive through guile\nthan excellence, became almost declared opponents. Eventually he had to\nleave Basel. He went to Esslingen, from which however he had to retire\nat no distant period from sheer want.\n\nThen began a period of wandering which really lasted for the last dozen\nyears of his life. This time was mainly one of learning in many ways\nof many things. The ground he covered must have been immense, for he\r\nvisited Colmar, Nurnberg, Appengall, Zurich, Augsburg, Middelheim,\nand travelled in Prussia, Austria, Hungary, Egypt, Turkey, Russia,\nTartary, Italy, the Low Countries and Denmark. In Germany and Hungary\nhe had a bad time, being driven to supply even the bare necessaries of\nlife by odd--any--means, even to availing himself of the credulity\nof others--casting nativities, telling fortunes, prescribing remedies\nfor animals of the farm such as cows and pigs, and recovering stolen\r\nproperty; such a life indeed as was the lot of a mediæval “tramp.” On\nthe other hand, as a contra he did worthy work as a military surgeon\nin Italy, the Low Countries and Denmark. When he got tired of his\nwandering life, he settled down in Salsburg, in 1541, under the care\nand protection of the Archbishop Ernst. But he did not long survive\nthe prospect of rest; he died later in the same year. The cause of his\ndeath is not known with any certainty, but we can guess that he had","clamorous enemies as well as strong upholding from the conflicting\ncauses given. Some said that he died from the effects of a protracted\ndebauch, others that he was murdered by physicians and apothecaries, or\ntheir agents, who had thrown him over a cliff. In proof of this story\nit was said that the surgeons had found a flaw or fracture in his skull\nwhich must have been produced during life.\n\nHe was buried in the churchyard of Saint Sebastian; but two centuries\r\nlater, 1752, his bones were moved to the porch of the church, and a\nmonument erected over them.\n\nHis first book was printed in Augsburg in 1526. His real monument\nwas the collection of his complete writings so far as was possible,\nthe long work of Johann Huser made in 1589-91. This great work was\npublished in German, from printed copy supplemented by such manuscript\nas could be discovered. Then and ever since there has been a perpetual\r\nrain of statements against him and his beliefs. Most of them are too\nsilly for words; but it is a little disconcerting to find one writer of\nsome distinction repeating so late as 1856 all the malignant twaddle\nof three centuries, saying amongst other things that he believed in\nthe transmutation of metals and the possibility of an _elixir vitæ_,\nthat he boasted of having spirits at his command, one of which he\nkept imprisoned in the hilt of his sword and another in a jewel; that\r\nhe could make any one live forever; that he was proud to be called a\nmagician; and had boasted of having a regular correspondence with Galen\nin Hell. We read in sensational journals and magazines of to-day about\ncertain living persons having--or saying that they have--communion in\nthe shape of “interviews” with the dead; but this is too busy an age\nfor unnecessary contradictions and so such assertions are allowed to\npass. The same indifference may now and again have been exhibited in\r\nthe case of men like Paracelsus.\n\nSome things said of him may be accepted as being partially true, for\nhis was an age of mysticism, occultism, astrology, and all manner of\nstrange and weird beliefs. For instance it is alleged that he held that\nlife is an emanation from the stars; that the sun governed the heart,\nthe moon the brain, Jupiter the liver, Saturn the gall, Mercury the\nlungs, Mars the bile, Venus the loins; that in each stomach is a demon,","that the belly is the grand laboratory where all the ingredients are\napportioned and mixed; and that gold could cure ossification of the\nheart.\n\nIs it any wonder that when in this age after centuries of progress such\nabsurd things are current Paracelsus is shewn in contemporary and later\nportraits with a jewel in his hand transcribed Azoth--the name given to\nhis familiar dæmon.\n\nThose who repeat _ad nauseam_ the absurd stories of his alchemy\r\ngenerally omit to mention his genuine discoveries and to tell of the\nwide scope of his teaching. That he used mercury and opium for healing\npurposes at a time when they were condemned; that he did all he could\nto stop the practice of administering the vile electuaries of the\nmediæval pharmacopœia; that he was one of the first to use laudanum;\nthat he perpetually held--to his own detriment--that medical science\nshould not be secret; that he blamed strongly the fashion of his time\r\nof accounting for natural phenomena by the intervention of spirits or\noccult forces; that he deprecated astrology; that he insisted on the\nproper investigation of the properties of drugs and that they should be\nused more simply and in smaller doses. To these benefits and reforms\nhis enemies answered that he had made a pact with the devil. For reward\nof his labours, his genius, his fearless struggle for human good he\nhad--with the exception of a few spells of prosperity--only penury,\r\nwant, malicious ill-fame and ceaseless attacks by the professors of\nreligion and science. He was an original investigator of open mind,\nof great ability and application, and absolutely fearless. He was\ncenturies ahead of his time. We can all feel grateful to that French\nwriter who said:\n\n    “Tels sont les services eminents que Paracelse a rendu à\n    l’humanité souffrante, pour laquelle il montra toujours le\n    dévouement le plus désintéressé; s’il en fut mal recompensé\r\npendant sa vie que sa mémoire au moins soit honorée.”\n\n\n\n\nCAGLIOSTRO\n\n\nThe individual known to history as Comte Cagliostro, or more familiarly\nas Cagliostro, was of the family name of Balsamo and was received into\nthe Church under the saintly name of Joseph. The familiarity of history\nis an appanage of greatness in some form. Greatness is in no sense a\nquality of worth or morality. It simply points to publicity, and if","unsuccessful, to infamy. Joseph Balsamo was of poor parentage in the\ntown of Palermo, Sicily, and was born in 1743. In his youth he did\nnot exhibit any talent whatever, such volcanic forces as he had being\nentirely used in wickedness--base, purposeless, sordid wickedness,\nfrom which devolved no benefit to any one--even to the criminal\ninstigator. In order to achieve greatness, or publicity, in any form,\nsome remarkable quality is necessary; Joseph Balsamo’s claim was based\r\nnot on isolated qualities but on a union of many. In fact he appears to\nhave had every necessary ingredient for this kind of success--except\none, courage. In his case however, the lacking ingredient in the\npreparation of his hell-broth was supplied by luck; though such luck\nhad to be paid for at the devil’s usual price--failure at the last.\nHis biographers put his leading characteristics in rather a negative\r\nthan a positive way--“indolent and unruly”; but as time went on the\nevil became more marked--even _ferae naturae_, poisonous growths,\nand miasmatic conditions have to manifest themselves or to cease to\nprevail. In the interval between young boyhood and coming manhood,\nBalsamo’s nature--such as it was--began to develop, unscrupulousness\nworking on an imaginative basis being always a leading characteristic.\nThe unruly boy shewed powers of becoming an unruly man, fear being the\r\nonly restraining force; and indolence giving way to wickedness. When\nhe was about fifteen he was sent to a monastery to learn chemistry and\npharmacy. The boy who had manifested a tendency to “grow downwards”\nfound the beginning of a kind of success in these studies in which,\nto the surprise of all, he exhibited a form of aptitude. Chemistry\nhas certain charms to a mind like his, for in its working are many\nstrange surprises and lurid effects not unattended with entrancing\r\nfears. These he used before long to his own pleasure in the concern\nof others. When he was expelled from the religious house he led a\ndissolute and criminal life in Palermo. Amongst other wickednesses he\nrobbed his uncle and forged his will. Here too, he committed a crime,\nnot devoid of a certain humorous aspect, but which had a reflex action\non his own life. Under promise of revealing a hidden treasure, he\npersuaded a goldworker, one Morano, to give him custody of a quantity","of his wares. It was what, in criminal slang is called “a put-up job,”\nand was worked by a gang of young thieves with Balsamo at their head.\nHaving filled the soft head of the foolish goldsmith with ideas to\nsuit his purpose, Joseph brought him on a treasure hunt into a cave\nwhere he was shortly surrounded by the gang dressed as fiends, who,\nin the victim’s paralysis of fear, robbed him at their ease of some\nsixty ounces of gold. Morano, as might have been expected, was not\r\nsatisfied with the proceedings and vowed vengeance which he tried to\neffect later. Balsamo’s pusillanimity worked hand in hand with Morano’s\nvindictiveness, to the effect that the culprit incontinently absconded\nfrom his native town. He conferred the benefit of his presence on\nMessina where he was naturally attracted to a noted alchemist called\nAlthotas, to whom he became a sort of disciple. Althotas was a man\r\nof great learning, according to the measure of that time and his own\noccupation. He was skilled in Eastern tongues and an adept occultist.\nIt was said that he had actually visited Mecca and Medina in the\ndisguise of an Oriental prince. Having attached himself to Althotas,\nCagliostro went with him to Malta where he persuaded the Grand Master\nof the Knights to supply them with a laboratory for the manufacture of\ngold, and also with letters of introduction which he afterwards used\r\nwith much benefit to himself.\n\n[Illustration: CAGLIOSTRO]\n\nFrom Malta he went to Rome where he employed himself in forging\nengravings. Like other criminals, great and small, Comte Alessandro\nCagliostro--as he had now become by his own creation of nobility--had\na faculty of working hard and intelligently so long as the end he\naimed at was to be accomplished by crooked means. Work in the ordinary\nways of honesty he loathed and shunned; but work as a help to his\r\nnefarious schemes seemed to be a joy to him. Then he set himself up as\na wonder-worker, improving as he went on all the customs and tricks\nof that calling. He sold an elixir which he said had all the potency\nusually attributed to such compounds but with an added efficacy all its\nown. He pretended to be able to transmute metals and to make himself\ninvisible; indeed to perform all the wonders of the alchemist, the","“cheap jack,” and the charlatan. At Rome he became acquainted with\nand married a very beautiful woman, Lorenza de Feliciani, daughter of\na lacemaker, round whom later biographers weave romances. According\nto contemporary accounts she seems to have been dowered with just\nsuch qualities as were useful in such a life as she had entered on.\nIn addition to great and unusual beauty she was graceful, passionate,\nseductive, clever, plausible, soothing, and attractive in all ways dear\r\nand convincing to men. She must have had some winning charm which\nhas lasted beyond her time, for a hundred years afterwards we find\nso level-headed a writer as Dr. Charles Mackay crediting her, quite\nunwarrantably with, amongst other good qualities, being a faithful\nwife. Her life certainly after her marriage was such that faithfulness\nin any form was one of the last things to expect in her. Her husband\nwas nothing less than a swindler of a protean kind. He had had a great\r\nnumber of aliases before he finally fixed on Comte de Cagliostro as\na _nomme de guerre_. He called himself successively Chevalier de\nFischio, Marquis de Melina (or Melissa), Marquis de Pellegrini, Comte\nde Saint-German, Baron de Belmonte; together with such names as Fenix,\nAnna, Harat. He wrote a work somewhat of the nature of a novel called\n_Le Grand Cophte_--which he found useful later when he was pushing his\nscheme of a sort of new Freemasonry. After his marriage he visited\r\nseveral countries, Egypt, Arabia, Persia, Poland, Russia, Greece,\nGermany; as well as such towns as Naples, Palermo, Rhodes, Strasbourg,\nParis, London, Lisbon, Vienna, Venice, Madrid, Brussels--in fact any\nplace where many fools were crowded into a small space. In many of\nthese he found use for the introductory letters of the Grand Master\nof the Knights of Malta, as well as those of other dupes from whom it\nwas his habit to secure such letters before the inevitable crash came.","Wherever he travelled he was accustomed to learn all he could of the\nmanners, customs and facts of each place he was in, thus accumulating\na vast stock of a certain form of knowledge which he found most useful\nin his chosen occupation--deceit. With regard to the last he utilised\nevery form of human credulity which came under his notice. The latter\nhalf of the eighteenth century was the very chosen time of strange\nbeliefs. Occultism became a fashion, especially amongst the richer\r\nclasses, with the result that every form of swindle came to the fore.\nAt this time Cagliostro, then nearing his fortieth year, began to have\na widespread reputation for marvellous cures. As mysticism in all sorts\nof forms had a vogue, he used all the tricks of the cult, gathering\nthem from various countries, especially France and Germany, where the\nfashion was pronounced. For this trickery he used all his knowledge of\r\nthe East and all the picturesque aids to credulity which he had picked\nup during his years of wandering; and for his “patter,” such medical\nterminology as he had learned--he either became a doctor or invented\na title for himself. This he interlarded with scraps of various forms\nof fraudulent occultism and all sorts of suggestive images of eastern\nquasi-religious profligacy. He took much of the imagery which he used\nin his rituals of fraud from records of ancient Egypt. This was a\r\npretty safe ground for his purpose, for in his time the Egypt of the\npast was a sealed book. It was only in 1799 that the Rosetta stone\nwas discovered, and more than ten years from then before Dr. Young was\nable to translate its three inscriptions--Hieroglyphic Demotic and\nGreek--whence Hieroglyphic knowledge had its source. _Omne ignotum\npro magnifico_ might well serve as a motto for all occultism, true\nor false. Cagliostro, whose business it was to deceive and mislead,\r\nunderstood this and took care that in his cabalistic forms Egyptian\nsigns were largely mixed with the pentagon, the signs of the Zodiac,\nand other mysterious symbols in common use. His object was primarily\nto catch the eye and so arrest the intelligence of any whom he wished\nto impress. For this purpose he went about gorgeously dressed and with\nimpressive appointments. In Germany for instance he always drove in","a carriage with four horses with courier and equerries in striking\nliveries. Happily there is extant a pen picture of him by Comte de\nBeugnot who met him in Paris at the house of the Comtesse de la Motte:\n\n    “of medium height and fairly fat, of olive colour, with short\n    neck and round face, big protruberant eyes, a snub nose with open\n    nostrils.”\n\nThis gives of him anything but an attractive picture; but yet M. de\nBeugnot says: “he made an impression on women whenever he came into a\r\nroom.” Perhaps his clothing helped, for it was not of a commonplace\nkind. De Beugnot who was manifestly a careful and intelligent observer\nagain comes to our aid with his pen:\n\n    “He wore a coiffure new in France; his hair parted in several\n    little cadenottes (queues or tresses) uniting at the back of the\n    head in the form known as a ‘catogan’ (hair clubbed or bunched).\n    A dress, French fashion, of iron grey, laced with gold, scarlet\r\nwaistcoat broidered with bold _point de spain_, red breeches, a\n    basket-hilted sword and a hat with white plumes!”\n\nAided by these adjuncts he was a great success in Paris whither he\nreturned in 1785. As an impostor he knew his business and played “the\ngame” well. When he was at work he brought to bear the influence of all\nhis “properties,” amongst them a tablecloth embroidered with cabalistic\nsigns in scarlet and the symbols of the Rosy Cross of high degree; the\r\nsame mysterious emblems marked the globe without which no wizard’s\natelier is complete.\n\nHere too were various little Egyptian figures--“ushabtui” he would\ndoubtless have called them had the word been in use in his day. From\nthese he kept his dupes at a distance, guarding carefully against\nany discovery. He evidently did not fear to hurt the religious\nsusceptibilities of any of his votaries, for not only were the crucifix\r\nand other emblems of the kind placed amongst the curios of his ritual,\nbut he made his invocation in the form of a religious ceremony, going\ndown on his knees and in all ways cultivating the emotions of those\nround him. He was aided by a young woman whom he described as pure\nas an angel and of great sensibility. The said young person kept\nher blue eyes fixed on a globe full of water. Then he proceeded to\nexpound the Great Secret which he told his hearers had been the same","since the beginning of things and whose mystery had been guarded by\nTemplars of the Rosy Cross, by Magicians, by Egyptians and the like.\nHe had claimed, as the Comte Saint-German said, that he had already\nexisted for many centuries; that he was a contemporary of Christ; and\nthat he had predicted His crucifixion by the Jews. As statements of\nthis kind were made mainly for the purpose of selling the elixir which\nhe peddled, it may easily be imagined that he did not shrink from\r\nlying or blasphemy when such seemed to suit his purpose. Daring and\nrecklessness in his statements seemed to further his business success,\nso prophecy--or rather boastings of prophecy _after the event_--became\npart of the great fraud. Amongst other things he said that he had\npredicted the taking of the Bastille. Such things shed a little light\non the methods of such impostors, and help to lay bare the roots or\nprinciples through which they flourish.\r\nAfter his Parisian success he made a prolonged tour in France. In la\nVendée he boasted of some fresh miracle--of his own doing--on each day;\nand at Lyons the boasting was repeated. Of course he occasionally had\nbad times, for now and again even the demons on whose acquaintance and\nhelp he prided himself did not work. In London after 1772, things had\nbecome so bad with him that he had to work as a house painter under\nhis own name. Whatever may have been his skill in his art this was\r\nprobably about the only honest work he ever did. He did not stick to\nit for long however, for four years afterwards he lost three thousand\npounds by frauds of others by whom he was introduced to fictitious\nlords and ladies. Here too he underwent a term of imprisonment for debt.\n\nNaturally such an impostor found in Freemasonry, which is a secret\ncult, a way of furthering his ends. With the aid of his wife, who all\nthrough their life together seems to have worked with him, he founded a\r\nnew branch of freemasonry in which a good many rules of that wonderful\norganisation were set at defiance. As the purpose of the new cult was\nto defraud, its net was enlarged by taking women into the body. The\nname used for it was the _Grand Egyptian Lodge_--he being himself the\nhead of it under the title of the _Cophte_ and his wife the _Grand\nPriestess_. In the ritual were some appalling ceremonies, and as these\nmade eventually for profitable publicity, the scheme was a great","success--and the elixir sold well. This elixir was the backbone of\nhis revenue; and indeed it would have been well worthy of success if\nit had been all that he claimed for it. Dispensers of elixirs are not\nusually backward in proclaiming the virtues of their wares; but in his\nvarious settings forth Cagliostro went further than others. He claimed\nnot only to restore youth and health and to make them perpetual,\nbut to restore lost innocence and effect a whole moral regeneration.\r\nNo wonder that he achieved success and that money rolled in! And no\nwonder that women, especially of the upper classes, followed him like\na flock of sheep! No wonder that a class rich, idle, pleasure-loving,\nand fond of tasting and testing new sensations, found thrilling moments\nin the great impostor’s mélange of mystery, religion, fear, and hope;\nof spirit-rapping and a sort of “black mass” in which Christianity\r\nand Paganism mingled freely, and where life and death, good and evil,\nwhirled together in a maddening dance.\n\nIt was not, however, through his alleged sorcery that Cagliostro crept\ninto a place in history; but by the association of his name with a\nsordid crime which involved the names of some of the great ones of the\nearth. The story of the Queen’s Necklace, though he was acquitted at\nthe trial which concluded it, will be remembered when the vapourings\r\nof the unscrupulous quack who had escaped a thousand penalties justly\nearned, have been long forgotten. Such is the irony of history! The\nstory of the necklace involved Marie Antoinette, Cardinal Prince de\nRohan, Comte de la Motte--an officer of the private guard of “Monsieur”\n(the Comte d’Artois), his wife Jeanne de Valois, descended from Henry\nII through Saint-Remy, his natural son and Nicole de Savigny. Louis XV\nhad ordered from MM. Boemer et Bassange, jewellers to the Court of\r\nFrance, a beautiful necklace of extraordinary value for his mistress\nMadame du Barry, but died before it was completed. The du Barry was\nexiled by his successor, so the necklace remained on the hands of its\nmakers. It was, however, of so great intrinsic value that they could\nnot easily find a purchaser. They offered it to Marie Antoinette for\none million eight hundred thousand livres; but the price was too\nhigh even for a queen, and the necklace remained on hand. So Boemer","showed it to Madame de la Motte and offered to give a commission on\nthe sale to whoever should find a buyer. She induced her husband,\nComte de la Motte, to join with her in a plot to accomplish the sale.\nDe la Motte was a friend of Cagliostro, and he too was brought in as\nhe had influence with the Cardinal Prince de Rohan whom they looked\non as a likely person to be of service. He had his own ambitions to\nacquire influence over the queen and use her for political purposes as\r\nMazarin had used Anne of Austria. De Rohan was then a man of fifty--not\nconsidered much of an age in these days, but the Cardinal’s life had\nnot made for comparative longevity. He was in fact something of that\nclass of fool which has no peer in folly--an old fool; and Jeanne\nde la Motte fooled him to the top of his bent. She pretended to him\nthat Marie Antoinette was especially friendly to her, and shewed him\nletters from the queen to herself all of which had been forged for the\r\npurpose. As at this time Madame de la Motte had borrowed or otherwise\nobtained from the Cardinal a hundred and twenty thousand livres, she\nfelt assured he could be used for the contemplated fraud. She probably\nhad not ever even spoken to the queen but she was not scrupulous in\nsuch a small matter as one more untruth. She finally persuaded him that\nMarie Antoinette wished to purchase the necklace through his agency, he\r\nacting for her and buying it in her name. To aid in the scheme she got\nher pet forger, Retaux de Vilette, to prepare a receipt signed “Marie\nAntoinette de France.” The Cardinal fell into the trap and obtained\nthe jewel, giving to Boemer four bills due successively at intervals\nof six months. At Versailles de Rohan gave the casket containing the\nnecklace to Madame de la Motte, who in his presence handed it to a\nvalet of the royal household for conveyance to the queen. The valet\r\nwas none other than the forger Retaux de Vilette. Madame de la Motte\nsent to the Cardinal a letter by the same forger asking him to meet her\n(the queen) in the shrubbery at Versailles between eleven o’clock and\nmidnight. To complete the deception a girl was procured, one Olivia,\nwho in figure resembled the queen sufficiently to pass for her in the\ndusk. The meeting between de Rohan and the alleged queen was held at","the Baths of Apollo--to the deception and temporary satisfaction of the\nambitious churchman. When the first instalment for the purchase of the\nnecklace was due, Boemer tried to find out if the queen really had\npossession of the necklace--which had in the meanwhile been brought to\nLondon, it was said, by Comte de la Motte. As Boemer could not manage\nto get an audience with the queen he came to the conclusion that he\nhad been robbed, and made the matter public. This was reported to\r\nM. de Breteuil, Master of the King’s household, and an enemy of de\nRohan. De Breteuil saw the queen secretly and they agreed to act in\nconcert in the matter. Louis XVI asked for details of the purchase\nfrom Boemer, who told the truth so far as he knew it, producing as a\nproof the alleged receipt of the queen. Louis pointed out to him that\nhe should have known that the queen did not sign after the manner of\nthe document. He then asked de Rohan, who was Grand Almoner of France,\r\nfor his written justification. This being supplied, he had him arrested\nand sent to the Bastille. Madame de la Motte accused Cagliostro of the\ncrime, alleging that he had persuaded de Rohan to buy the necklace. She\nwas also arrested as were Retaux de Vilette, and, later on at Brussels,\nOlivia, who threw some light on the fraud. The King brought the whole\nmatter before Parliament, which ordered a prosecution. As the result of\r\nthe trial which followed, Comte de la Motte and Retaux de Vilette were\nbanished for life; Jeanne de la Motte was condemned to make _amende\nhonourable_, to be whipped and branded with V on both shoulders, and\nto be imprisoned for life. Olivia and Cagliostro were acquitted. The\nCardinal was cleared of all charges. Nothing seems to have been done\nfor the poor jewellers, who, after all, had received more substantial\ninjury than any of the others, having lost nearly two million livres.\r\nAfter the affair of the Necklace, Cagliostro spent a time in the\nBastille and when free, after some months, he and his wife travelled\nagain in Europe. In 1789 he was arrested at Rome by order of the\nInquisition and condemned to death as a Freemason. The punishment was\nlater commuted to perpetual imprisonment. He ended his days in the\nChâteau de Saint-Leon near Rome. His wife was condemned to perpetual\nseclusion and died in the Convent of Sainte-Appolive.\n\n\n\n\nMESMER","Although Frederic-Antoine Mesmer made an astonishing discovery which,\nhaving been tested and employed in therapeutics for a century, is\naccepted as a contribution to science, he is included in the list of\nimpostors because, however sound his theory was, he used it in the\nmanner or surrounded with the atmosphere of imposture. Indeed the\nimplement which he used in his practice, and which made him famous in\nfashionable and idle society, was set forth as having magic properties.\r\nHe belonged to the same period as Cagliostro, having been born but nine\nyears before him, in 1734, in Itzmang, Suabia; but the impostor pure\nand simple easily picked up the difference by beginning his life-work\nearlier and following it quicker with regard to results. Mesmer was not\nin any sense a precocious person. He was thirty-two years of age when\nhe took his degree of Doctor of Medicine at Vienna in 1765. However\r\nhe had already chosen his subject, animal magnetism as allied with\nmedical therapeutics. His early script under the title _De planetarum\ninfluxi_ is looked on as a legal reminiscence of judicial astronomy. He\nleft Vienna because, he said, of a cabal against him, and travelled\nin Europe, particularly in Switzerland, before he went to Paris to\nseek his fortune. This was in 1778, when he was some forty-four years\nof age; his reputation, which had been growing all the time, preceded\r\nhim. He was then a man of fine appearance, tall and important-looking\nand conveying a sense of calm power. He produced much sensation and was\nat once credited--not without his own will or intention--with magic\npower. He posed as a benefactor of humanity; a position which was at\nonce conceded to him, partly owing to the fact that an extraordinary\natmosphere of calm seemed to surround him, which with his natural\nair of assurance founded on self-belief, was able to convey to his\r\npatients a sense of hope which was of course very helpful in cases of\nnervous failure and depression. He settled in the Hotel Bouret near the\nPlace Vendôme and so in the heart of Paris; and at once undertook the\ntreatment of patients hitherto deemed incurable. Fashion took up the\nnew medical “craze” or “sensation,” and he at once became the vogue.\nIt was at this time of his life that Mesmer came to the parting of\nthe ways between earnest science and charlatanism. So far as we know","he still remained earnest in his scientific belief--as indeed he was\ntill the end of his days. Inasmuch as fashion requires some concrete\nexpression of its fancies, Mesmer soon used the picturesque side of\nhis brain for the service of fashionable success. So he invented an\nappliance which soon became the talk of the town. This was the famous\n_baquet magique_ or magic tub, a sort of covered bath, round which his\npatients were arranged in tiers. To the bath were attached a number\r\nof tubes, each of which was held by a patient, who could touch with\nthe end of it any part of his or her body at will. After a while the\npatients began to get excited, and many of them went into convulsions.\nAmongst them walked Mesmer, clad in an imposing dress suggestive of\nmystery and carrying a long wand of alleged magic power; often calming\nthose who had already reached the stage of being actually convulsed.\r\nHis usual method of producing something of the same effect at private\nséances, was by holding the hand of the patient, touching the forehead\nand making “passes” with the open hand with fingers spread out, and by\ncrossing and uncrossing his arms with great rapidity.\n\nA well-attended séance must have been a curious and not altogether\npleasant experience even to a wholesome spectator in full possession\nof his natural faculties. The whole surroundings of the place\r\ntogether with the previously cultured belief; the dusk and mystery;\nthe “mysterious sympathy of numbers”--as Dean Farrar called it; the\nspasmodic snapping of the cords of tensity which took away all traces\nof reserve or reticence from the men and women present; the vague\nterror of the unknown, that mysterious apprehension which is so potent\nwith the nerves of weak or imaginative people; and, it may be, the\nslipping of the dogs of conscience--all these combined to wreck the\r\nmoral and mental stability of those present, most of whom it must be\nremembered were actually ill, or imagined themselves to be so, which\ncame practically to the same thing. The psychical emotion was all very\nwell in the world of pleasure; but these creatures became physically\nsick through nervous strain. As described by the historian, they\nexpectorated freely a viscous fluid, and their sickness passed into\nconvulsions more or less violent; the women naturally succumbing more","readily and more quickly than the men. This absolute collapse--half\nepileptic, half hysterical--lasted varying periods according to the\ninfluence exercised by the presence of the calm, self-reliant operator.\nWe of a later age, when electric force has been satisfactorily\nharnessed and when magnetism as a separate power is better understood,\nmay find it hard to understand that the most advanced and daring\nscientists of the time--to whom Frederic-Antoine Mesmer was at least\r\nallied--were satisfied that magnetism and electricity were variants\nof the same mysterious force or power. It was on this theory that he\nseems to have worked his main idea to practical effect. The base of his\nsystem was animal magnetism, which could be superinduced or aided by\nmechanical appliances. He did not deceive himself into believing that\nhe had invented the idea but was quite willing to make the utmost use\r\nhe could of the discoveries and inventions of others. So far as we can\ngather his intentions from his acts, the main object in his scientific\nwork was to simplify the processes of turning emotion into effect.\nMagnetism had already been largely studied, and means were being\nconstantly sought for increasing its efficacy. Father Hehl had brought\nto a point of accepted perfection the manufacture of metal plates\nused in magnetic development, and these Mesmer used, with the result\r\nthat a violent controversy took place between them. So far as we can\nfollow after the lapse of time, Mesmer was consistent in his theories\nand their application. He held that the principle was one of planetary\ninfluence on the nervous system, and its manifestation was by a process\nof alternate intension and remission. It is possible that Mesmer--who\nheld that the heavenly bodies floated in a limitless magnetic fluid and\nthat he could make all substances, even such things as bread or dogs\r\nmagnetic--had in his mind the wisdom of following the same theory in\nmatters of lesser significance, though of more individual import, than\nthose of astronomy and its correlated sciences. If so he was wise in\nhis generation, for later electricians have found that the system of\nalternating currents especially at high tension, is of vast practical\nimportance. That he was practical in his use of the ideas of others\nis shown by the fact that he preferred the metallic plates of Father","Hehl to his own passes, even though the report of the Royal Commission\nruined him--at any rate checked his success, by stating that similar\neffects to those attending his passes could be produced by other\nmeans, and that such passes had no effect unless through the patient’s\nknowledge; in fact that it was all the work of imagination. Mesmer had\nbeen asked to appear before the Commission of the Faculty of Medicine\nappointed in 1784 to investigate and report, but he kept away. It would\r\nnot have injured any man to have appeared before such a commission if\nhis cause had been a good one. There were two such commissions. The\nfirst was of the leading physicians of Paris, and included such men\nas Benjamin Franklin, Lavoisier, the great chemist, and Bailly, the\nhistorian of astronomy.\n\nIt was distinctly to his disadvantage that Mesmer always kept at a\ndistance the whole corps of savants such as the Faculty of Medicine\r\nand the Academy of Sciences--for they would no doubt have accepted\nhis views, visionary though they were, if he could have shown any\nscientific base for them. True medical science has always been\nsuspicious of, and cautious regarding, empiricism. More than once he\nstood in his own light in this matter--whether through obstinacy or\ndoubt of his own theory does not matter. For instance, in Vienna,\nwhen his very existence as a scientist was at stake in the matter of\r\nthe effects of his treatment of Mademoiselle Paradis, he introduced a\nhumiliating clause in his challenge to the Faculty which caused them\nto refuse to accept it. Mademoiselle Paradis was blind and subject\nto convulsions. After treating her by his own method Mesmer said she\nwas cured. An oculist said, after testing, that she was as blind as\never, and her family said that she was still subject to convulsions.\nBut Mesmer persisted that she was cured, that there was a conspiracy\r\nagainst him, and that Mademoiselle Paradis had feigned. He challenged\nthe Faculty of Medicine on the subject of his discovery. Twenty-four\npatients were to be selected by the Faculty; of these twelve were to be\ntreated by Mesmerism and the other half by the means ordinarily in use.\nThe condition he imposed was that the witnesses were _not_ to be of the\nFaculty.\n\nAgain, when in answer to a request on his part that the French","Government for the good of the community should subsidise him, a\nproposal was made to him, he did not receive it favourably. The request\nhe made to Marie Antoinette was that he should have an estate and\nchâteau and a handsome income, so that he might go on experimenting; he\nput the broad figures at four hundred or five hundred thousand francs.\nThe Government suggestion was that he should have a pension of twenty\nthousand francs and the Cross of Saint Michael (Knighthood) if he would\r\ncommunicate for public use, to a board of physicians nominated by the\nKing, such discoveries as he might make. After his refusal of the\nGovernment proposition Mesmer went to Spa, taking with him a number\nof his patients, and there opened a magnetic establishment where he\nrenewed his Paris success. He asked Parliament to hold an impartial\nexamination into the theory and working of Animal Magnetism. Foiled in\nhis scheme of state purchase on his own terms, he sold his secret to a\r\ngroup of societies, the members of which were to pay him a subscription\nof a hundred louis _per capita_. By this means he realised some 340,000\nlivres--representing to-day over a million. The associated body was\ncomposed of twenty-four societies called “societés de l’harmonie”--a\nsort of Freemasonry, under a Grand Master and Chiefs of the Order. A\nmember had to be at the time of admission twenty-five years of age, of\r\nhonest state and good name, not to smoke tobacco, and to pay an annual\nsubscription of at least sixty francs. There were three grades in the\nOrder: Initiated Associates, Corresponding Associates and Uninitiated.\nAmongst those belonging to the Society were such men as Lafayette,\nd’Espremisnil, and Berthollet the great chemist. Berthollet had,\nhowever, peculiar privileges, amongst which was the right of criticism.\nOn one occasion he had a “row” with Mesmer about his charlatanism.\r\nAt length the French public, wearied with his trickeries and angry with\nhis cupidity, openly expressed their dissatisfaction. Whereupon he left\nFrance, taking with him a fortune of three hundred and forty thousand\nfrancs. He went to England and thence to Germany. Finally he settled\ndown in Mersbourg in his native country, Suabia, where he died in 1815,\nat the age of eighty-one.\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE WANDERING JEW\n\n\nThe legend of the Wandering Jew has its roots in a belief in the","possibility of human longevity beyond what is natural and normal. It\nis connected with the story of the Crucifixion and the mysteries that\npreceded and followed it. Our account may find its starting point\nin a book of extraordinary interest which made a sensation in the\nseventeenth century and is still delightful reading. The passage which\nshould arrest our attention is as follows:\n\n    “The story of the Wandering Jew is very strange and will hardly\r\nobtain belief; yet there is a small account thereof set down by\n    _Matthew Paris_ from the report of an Armenian Bishop; who came\n    into this Kingdom about four hundred years ago, and had often\n    entertained this wanderer at his Table. That he was then alive,\n    was first called _Cartaphilus_, was keeper of the Judgment Hall,\n    whence thrusting out our Saviour with expostulation of his stay,\n    was condemned to stay until His return; was after baptized by\r\n_Ananias_, and by the name of Joseph; was thirty years old in\n    the dayes of our Saviour, remembered the Saints that arised\n    with Him, the making of the Apostles’ Creed, and their several\n    peregrinations. Surely were this true, he might be an happy\n    arbitrator in many Christian controversies; but must impardonably\n    condemn the obstinacy of the Jews, who can contemn the Rhetorick\n    of such miracles, and blindly behold so living and lasting\r\nconversions.”\n\nThe above is taken from the work entitled “Pseudoxia Epidemica” or\nEnquiries into very many Received Tenets and Commonly Presumed Truths\nby Sir Thomas Brown, Knight M.D. This was first published in 1640,\nso that the “about four hundred years ago” mentioned would bring the\nreport of the Armenian Bishop to the first half of the thirteenth\ncentury.\n\nThus unless there be something of an authoritative character to upset\r\nthe theory, Matthew Paris must be taken as the first European narrator\nof the story. As a matter of fact the legend began just about the time\nthus arrived at. The great work in Latin, “_Historia Major_,” was begun\nby Roger of Wendover and completed in 1259 by the monk Matthew Paris.\nIt was not however published--in our ordinary sense of the word--until\nthe beginning of the year 1571 when Archbishop Parker took it in hand.","In the meantime the art of printing had been established and the new\nworld of thought and the reproduction of its fruit, had been developed\nfor common use. The _Historia Major_ was again printed in Zurich in\n1589 and 1606. The next English edition was in 1640. This was reprinted\nin Paris in 1644. The English edition of forty years later, 1684,\nwas a really fine specimen of typographic art. The authorship and\ndate of its printing are given: Matthaei Paris, Monachi Albanensis\r\nAngli London MDCLXXXIV. The script is in ecclesiastical Latin and\nto any modern reader is of a fresh and almost child-like sincerity\nwhich at once disarms doubt or hostile criticism. Indeed it affords\na good example of the mechanism of myth, showing how the littleness\nof human nature--vanity with its desire to shine and credulity in its\nprimitive form, are not subject to the controlling influences of either\nsacredness of subject or the rulings of common sense. It lends another\r\nmeaning to the quotation of Feste, the jester: _Cucullus non facit\nMonachum_. The artless narrative recorded in the _Historia Major_ makes\nthe whole inception of the myth transparent. In the monastery of St.\nAlbans a conversation is held by the monks on one side and the Armenian\nArchbishop--name not given, on the other. The interpreter in French\nis one Henri Spigurnel a native of Antioch, servant of the bishop.\nWe can gather even how Sir Thomas Brown M. D., doctor of Norwich and\r\nmost open-minded of scientists, lent himself, unconsciously, to the\npropagation of error. Brown reading, or hearing read, the work of\nMatthew Paris took it for granted that the record was correct and\ncomplete; and in his own book summarises or generalises the statements\nmade. For instance he says that the Armenian bishop had “often\nentertained this wanderer at his table” &c. Now it was his servant\nwho told the monks that the wandering Jew whom he had seen and heard","speaking many times dined at the table of his lord the Archbishop.\nThis at once minimises the value of the statement, for it does away\nat once with the respect due to the bishop’s high office and presumed\ncharacter, and with the sense of intellectual acumen and accuracy which\nmight be expected to emanate from one of his scholarship and quality.\nThus we get the story not from an accredited Bishop on a foreign\nmission--rare at the period and entrusted only to men of note--but from\r\nthe gossip of an Armenian lacquey or valet, trying to show his own\nimportance to a credulous serving brother of the monastery. And so,\nafter all, coming from this source it is to be accepted with exceeding\ncare--not to say doubt, even when seconded by the learned monastic\nscribe Matthew. So, also, for instance is his statement regarding the\nmanner in which the wanderer’s life is miraculously prolonged. It is\nto this effect. Each hundredth year Joseph falls into a faint so that\r\nhe lies for a time unconscious. When he recovers he finds that his age\nis restored to that which it was when the Lord suffered. Joseph, it\nmust be borne in mind, is the Wandering Jew, once Cartaphilus, who had\nkept Pilate’s judgment-hall. Then Matthew himself takes up the story\nand gives what professes to be the _ipsissima verba_ of the servant as\nto the conversation between Christ and Cartaphilus which culminated in\r\nthe terrible doom pronounced on the janitor who, from the showing, did\nnot seem a whit worse than any of the crowd present on that momentous\nday in Jerusalem. When Jesus, wearied already with carrying the great\ncross, leaned for a moment against the wall of the house of Cartaphilus\njust opposite the Judgment-hall the official said:\n\n    “‘Vade Jesu citius, vade, quid moraris?’ et Jesus severo vultu et\n    oculo respiciens eum, dixit: ‘Ego vado. Expectabis donec veniam.’”\r\nNow this is the whole and sole foundation of the individual Wandering\nJew. I say “individual” because there were before long other variants,\nand many old beliefs and fables were appropriated and used to back up\nthe marvellous story, invented by the Armenian servant and recorded\nby the learned monk, Matthew. Amongst these beliefs were those\nwhich taught that John the Baptist never died; that the aloe blooms\nonly once in a hundred years; and that the phœnix renews itself in","fire. It is the tendency of legendary beliefs to group or nucleate\nthemselves as though there were a conscious and intentional effort at\nself-protection; and this, together with the natural human tendency to\nenlarge and elaborate an accepted idea, is responsible for much. The\nlegend started in the thirteenth century, took root and flourished, and\nin the very beginning of the seventeenth a variant blossomed. In this\r\nJoseph, originally Cartaphilus, became Ahasuerus. In the long pause the\nstory, after the manner of all things of earth, had grown, details not\nbeing lacking. The world was informed through the Bishop of Schleswig,\nhow in 1547, at Hamburg, a man was seen in the Cathedral who arrested\nattention--why we are not told. He was about fifty years of age, of\nreverend manner, and dressed in ragged clothes; he bowed low at the\nname of Christ. Many of the nobility and gentry who saw him recognised\r\nhim as one whom they had already seen in various places--England,\nFrance, Italy, Hungary, Persia, Spain, Poland, Moscow, Lieffland,\nSweden, Denmark, Scotland, &c. Inquiry being made of him, he told the\nBishop that he was Ahasuerus the shoe-maker of Jerusalem, who had been\npresent at the Crucifixion and had ever since been always wandering.\nHe was well posted in history, especially regarding the lives and\nsufferings of the Apostles, and told how, when he had directed Christ\r\nto move on, the latter had answered: “I will stand here and rest, but\nthou shalt move on till the last day.” He had been first seen, we are\ntold, at Lubeck.\n\nIt is strange that in an age of religious domination many of the\nlegends of Our Saviour seem to have been based on just such intolerant\nanger at personal slight as might have ruled a short-tempered,\nvain man. For instance look at one of the Christ legends which was\r\nreproduced in poor Ophelia’s distracted mind apropos of the owl, “They\nsay, the owl was a baker’s daughter.” The Gloucestershire legend runs\nthat Christ having asked for bread at baking time the mistress of the\nbakery took dough from the oven, but her daughter having remonstrated\nas to the size of the benefaction was turned into an owl. The penalty\ninflicted on the erring janitor of the Presidium is another instance.\n\nThe “Wandering Jew” legend once started, was hard to suppress. The","thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were the ages\nof Jew-baiting in the kingdoms of the West, and naturally the stories\ntook their colour from the prevailing idea.\n\nIn 1644, Westphalus learned from various sources that the Wandering Jew\nhealed diseases, and that he had said he was at Rome when it was burned\nby Nero; that he had seen the return of Saladin after his Eastern\nConquests; that he had been in Constantinople when Salimen had built\r\nthe royal mosque; that he knew Tamerlane the Scythian, and Scander\nBeg, Prince of Epirus; that he had seen Bajazet carried in a cage by\nTamerlane’s order; that he remembered the Caliphs of Babylon and of\nEgypt, the Empire of the Saracens, and the Crusades where he had known\nGodfrey de Bouillon. Amongst other things he seems to have apologised\nfor not seeing the Sack of Jerusalem, because he was at that time in\nRome at the Court of Vespasian.\r\nThe Ahasuerus version of the Wandering Jew legend seems to have been\nthe popular one amongst the commonalty in England. As an instance\nmight be quoted the broad-sheet ballad of 1670. It is not without even\nhistorical significance as it marks the measure of the time in many\nways. It is headed: “The Wandering Jew, or the Shoemaker of Jerusalem\nwho lived when Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ was crucified\nappointed by Him to live until Coming again. Tune, _The Lady’s Fall_\r\n&c. Licens’d and Enter’d according to order.” The imprint runs:\n“Printed by and for W. O. and sold by the Booksellers of Pyecorner and\nLondon-Bridge.”\n\nA century and a half later--1828--was published a much more pretentious\nwork on the same theme. This was a novel written by Rev. George Croly.\nIt was called: “Salathiel: a Story of the Past, the Present, the\nFuture.” It was published anonymously and had an immediate and lasting\nsuccess. It was founded on historical lines, the author manifestly\r\nbenefiting by the hints afforded by the work of that consummate liar\n(in a historical sense) Westphalus--or his informant. Croly was\na strange man with a somewhat abnormal faculty of abstraction. I\nused to hear of him from my father who was a friend of his about a\nhundred years ago. Being of gentle nature he did not wish to cause\nany pain or concern to his family or dependents; but at the same\ntime he, as a writer, had to guard himself against interruption and","consequent digression of his thoughts during the times he set apart\nfor imaginative work. So he devised a scheme which might often be\nput in practice with advantage by others similarly employed. When\nsettling down to a spell of such work--which as every creative\nwriter knows involves periods of mental abstraction though of bodily\nrestlessness--he would stick an adhesive wafer on his forehead. The\nrule of the house was that when he might be adorned in this wise no one\r\nwas to speak to him, or even notice him, except under special necessity.\n\nThe great vogue of _Salathiel_ lasted some ten or more years, when\nthe torch of the Wandering Jew was lighted by Eugene Sue the French\nnovelist who had just completed in the _Débats_ his story “Les Mystères\nde Paris.” As its successor he chose the theme adopted by Croly, and\nthe new novel _Le Juif-Errant_ ran with overwhelming success in the\n_Constitutionnel_.\r\nSue was what in modern slang is called “up to date.” He knew every\ntrick and dodge of the world of advertisement, and in conjunction\nwith his editor, Dr. Veron, he used them all. But he had good wares\nto exploit. His novels are really excellent, though the changes in\nsocial life and in religious, political and artistic matters, which\ntook place between 1844 and 1910, make some things in them seem out of\ndate. His great imagination, and his firm and rapid grasp of salient\r\nfacts susceptible of being advantageously used in narrative, pointed\nout to him a fresh road. It was not sufficient to the hour and place\nthat Cartaphilus--or Joseph--or Ahasuerus, or Salathiel or whatever he\nmight be called--should purge his sin by his personal sufferings alone.\nIn the legend, up to then accepted, he had long ago repented; so to\nincrease the poignancy of his sufferings, Sue took from the experience\nof his own time a means of embittering the very inmost soul of such an\r\none. He must be made to feel that his existence is a curse not only to\nhimself but to all the world. To this end he attached to the Wanderer\nthe obligation of carrying a fell disease. The quick brain of the great\n_feuilletonist_ seized the dramatic moment for utilising the occasion.\nA dozen years before, the frightful spread of the cholera, which had\nonce again wrought havoc, woke the whole world to new terror. Some one","of uneasy mind who found diversion in obscure comparisons, noted from\nthe records of the disease that its moving showed the same progress in\na given direction as a man’s walking. A hint was sufficient for the\npublic who eagerly seized the idea that the Wandering Jew had, from the\nfirst recorded appearance of the cholera, been the fated carrier of\nthat dreaded pestilence. The idea seemed to be a dramatic inspiration\nand had prehensile grasp. Great as had been the success of the\r\n_Mysteries of Paris_, that of _The Wandering Jew_ surpassed it, and for\nhalf a century the new novel kept vividly before its readers the old\ntradition, and so brought it down to the present.\n\nWe may now begin to ask ourselves who and where in this great deception\nwas the impostor. Who was the guilty one? And at first glance we\nare inclined to say “There is none! Whatever the error, mistake,\ndeception, or false conclusion, there has been no direct guilt.” This\r\nis to presuppose that guilt is of conscious premeditation; and neither\nintention of evil nor consciousness of guilt is apparent. In legal\nphrase the _mens rea_ is lacking.\n\nIt is a purely metaphysical speculation whether guilt is a necessary\nelement of imposition. One is an intellectual experience, the other is\nan ethical problem; and if we are content to deal with responsibility\nfor another’s misdoing, the question of the degree of blameworthiness\r\nis sufficient. Let us try a process of exclusions. The complete list of\nthose who had a part in the misunderstanding regarding the myth of the\nWandering Jew, leaving out the ostensible fictionists, were:\n\nThe Abbot of St. Albans, the Archbishop of Armenia, the interpreter,\nthe Archbishop’s servant, the monks or laybrothers who singly or in\ngeneral conversed with any of the above; and finally Matthew Paris who\nrecorded the story in its various phases. Of these we must except from\r\nall blame both the Abbot of St. Albans and the Archbishop of Armenia,\nboth of whom were good grave men of high character and to each of whom\nhad been entrusted matters of the highest concern. The interpreter\nseems to have only fulfilled his office with exactitude; if in any way\nor part he used his opportunity to impose on the ignorance of the host\nor the guest there is no record, no suggestion of it. Matthew Paris\nwas a man of such keenness of mind, of such observation and of such","critical insight, that even to-day, after a lapse of over five hundred\nyears, and the withstanding of all the tests of a new intellectual\nworld which included such inventions as printing and photography, he\nis looked upon as one of the ablest of chroniclers. Moreover he put no\nnew matter nor comments of his own into the wonderful and startling\nnarratives which he was called on to record. He even hints at or infers\nhis own doubt as to the statements made. The monks, servants and others\r\nmentioned generally, were merely credulous, simple people of the time,\nwith reverence for any story regarding the _Via Dolorosa_, and respect\nor awe for those in high places.\n\nThere remains but the servant of the foreign Archbishop. It is to\nhim that we must look for any outrage on our normal beliefs. He was\nmanifestly a person of individually small importance--even Matthew\nParis whose trained work it was to record with exactness, and whose\r\nduty it therefore was to sustain or buttress main facts, did not think\nit necessary or worth while to mention his name. He had in himself\nnone of the dignity, honour, weight, learning or position of the\nnoble of the Church who was the Abbot’s guest. He was after all but\na personal servant; probably one of readiness and expediency with a\nquick imagination and a glib tongue. One who could wriggle through a\ndifficult position, defend himself with ready acquiescence, gain his\r\nends of securing his master’s ease, and find all necessary doors open\nthrough the bonhommie of his fellow servitors. Such an one accustomed\nto the exigencies of foreign travel, must have picked up many quaint\nconceits, legends and japes, and was doubtless a _persona grata_ liked\nand looked up to by persons of his own class, sanctified to some little\nextent by the reflected glory of his master’s great position. It is\r\nmore than likely that he had been the recipient of many confidences\nregarding legend and conjecture concerning sacred matters, and that any\nsuch legend as he spoke of would have been imparted under conditions\nfavourable to his own comfort. After the manner of his kind his\nstories doubtless lost nothing in the telling and gained considerably\nin the re-telling. Even in the short record of Matthew Paris, there\nis evidence of this in the way in which, after the striking story of","Cartaphilus has been told, he returns to the matter again, adding\npicturesque and inconclusive details of the manner of the centennial\nrenewal of the wanderer’s youth. The simplest analysis here will show\nthe falsity of the story; what the great logician Archbishop Whately\nalways insisted on--“internal evidence”--is dead against the Armenian\nvalet, courier, or servitor. He gave circumstantial account of the\nperiodic illness, loss of memory, and recovery of youth on the part\r\nof Cartaphilus; but there is no hint of how he came to know it, and\nCartaphilus could not have told him, nor anybody else. We may, I think,\ntake it for granted that no other mere mortal was present, for, had any\nother human being been there, all the quacksalvers of a thousand miles\naround would have moved heaven and earth to get information of what was\ngoing on, since in mediæval days there was nearly as much competition\r\nin the world of charlatanism as there is to-day in the world of sport.\nThe Armenian was much too handy a man at such a crisis to be found out,\nso we may give him the benefit of the doubt and at once credit him\nwith invention. It is hard to understand--or even to believe without\nunderstanding--that so mighty a legend and one so tenacious of life,\narose and grew from such a beginning. And yet it is in accord with\nthe irony of nature that one who has unintentionally and unwittingly\r\nachieved a publicity which would dwarf the malign reputation of\nHerostratus should have his name unrecorded.\n\n\n\n\nIV. JOHN LAW\n\nTHE MISSISSIPPI SCHEME AND ITS ANTECEDENTS\n\n\nThe great “Mississippi Scheme” which wrought havoc on the French in\n1720 is the central and turning point in the history of John Law, late\nof Lauriston, Controller-General of Finance in France. His father,\nWilliam Law (grand nephew of James Law, Archbishop of Glasgow) was a\ngoldsmith in that city.\r\nAs in the seventeenth century the goldsmiths were also the bankers and\nmoneylenders of the community, a successful goldsmith might be looked\non as on the highroad to great fortune. To William Law in 1671 was\nborn his first son John, who had considerable natural talent in the\nway of mathematics--and a nature which was such as to nullify their\nuse. As a youth he showed proficiency in arithmetic and algebra, but\nas he was also in those early days riotous and dissipated, we may","fairly come to the conclusion that he did not use his natural powers\nto their best advantage. He was already a gambler of a marked kind.\nBefore he was of age he was already in debt and was squandering his\npatrimony. He sold the estate of Lauriston which his thrifty father\nhad acquired, and gave himself over to a life of so-called pleasure.\nHis mother, who had family ambitions, bought the estate so that it\nmight remain in the family of its new possessors. He removed himself\r\nto London where within a couple of years he was sentenced to death for\nmurder--not a vulgar premeditated murder for gain, but the unhappy\nresult of a duel wherein he had killed his opponent, a boon companion,\none Austin who had acquired the soubriquet of “Beau” Austin. Through\nsocial influence the death penalty was commuted for imprisonment,\nand the crime only regarded as manslaughter. He had however to deal\r\nwith the relatives of the dead man who were naturally vindictive. One\nof them entered an appeal against the commutation of the sentence.\nLaw, with the characteristic prudence of his time and nationality,\ndid not wait for the leisurely settlement of the legal process, but\nescaped to the continent where he remained for some years sojourning\nin various places. Being naturally clever and daring he seems to have\ngenerally fallen on his feet. Whilst in Holland he became secretary\r\nto an important official in the diplomatic world, from which service\nhe drifted into an employment with the Bank of Amsterdam. Here the\nnatural bent of his mind found expression. Banking in some of its\nforms is gambling, and as he was both banker and gambler--one by\ninherited tendency and the other by personal disposition--he began to\nfind his vogue, addressing himself seriously to the intricacies and\npossibilities of the profession of banking. He was back in Scotland in\r\n1701 (a risky venture on his part for his felony had not been “purged”)\nand published a pamphlet, “_Proposals and Reasons for constituting a\nCouncil of Trade in Scotland_.” This he followed up after some years,\nwith another pamphlet, “_Money and Trade considered, with a proposal\nfor supplying the Nation with Money_”; and in the same year (1709) he\npropounded to the Scotch Parliament a scheme for a State Bank on the\nsecurity of land--a venture which on being tried speedily collapsed.","This, like other schemes of that period, was based on the issue and use\nof paper money.\n\n[Illustration: JOHN LAW]\n\nIn the meantime, and for five or six years afterwards, he was\ntravelling variously throughout Europe, occupying himself with\nformulating successive schemes of finance, and in gambling--a process\nin which he, being both skilled and lucky, amassed a sum of over a\nhundred thousand pounds. He had varying fortunes, however, and was\r\nexpelled from several cities. He was not without believers in his\npowers. Amongst them was the Earl of Stair, then Ambassador to France,\nwho allured by his specious methods of finance, suggested to the Earl\nof Stanhope that he might be useful in devising a scheme for paying off\nthe British National Debt. After the death of Louis XIV, in 1715, he\nsuggested to the Duke of Orleans, the Regent for the young King (Louis\r\nXV), the formation of a State Bank. The Regent favoured the idea, but\nhis advisers were against it; it was, however, agreed that Law might\nfound a bank with power to issue notes and accept deposits. This was\ndone by Letters Patent and the _Banque Générale_ came into existence in\n1710, and was an immediate success. Its principle was to issue paper\nmoney which was to be repayable by coin. Its paper rose to a premium\nin 1716; in 1717 there was a decree that it was to be accepted in the\r\npayment of taxes. This created a new form of cheap money, with the\nresult that there was a great and sudden extension of industry and\ntrade. From this rose the idea of a new enterprise--The Mississippi\nCompany--which was to outvie the success of the East India Company\nincorporated by Charter in 1600 under the title of “The Governor and\nCompany of the Merchants of London trading to the East Indies,” which\nafter periods of doubtful fortune, and having become consolidated with\r\nits rival “The General East India Company”--partially in 1702, and\ncompletely in 1708, under the somewhat elephantine name of “The United\nCompany of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies”--was now\na vast organization of national importance. To the new French Company\nfor exploiting the Mississippi Valley was made over Louisiana (which\nthen included what were afterwards the States of Ohio and Missouri).\nThe Decree of Incorporation was issued in 1717. The Parliament at","Paris presently grew jealous of such a concession having been given\nto a foreigner; and the next year a rumour went about that Parliament\nwas about to have him arrested, tried, and hanged. The Regent met\nthe parliamentary resistance by making (1718) the _Banque Générale_\ninto the _Banque Royale_--the King guaranteeing the notes. Law was\nmade Director General; but he was unable to prevent the Regent from\nincreasing the issue of paper money, by which means he managed to\r\nsatisfy dishonestly his own extravagance. It was a fiscal principle\nof the time that the State accountants did not go behind the King’s\nreceipt--the _acquit de comptant_ as it was called.\n\nThe Western Company was enlarged in 1718 by a grant of a monopoly of\ntobacco, and of the rights of trading ships and merchandise of the\nCompany of Senegal. In 1719, the _Banque Royale_ absorbed the rights of\nthe East India and China Companies, and then assumed the all-embracing\r\ntitle of _Compagnie des Indes_. The next year it took in the African\nCompany; and so through that the whole of the non-European trade of\nFrance. In 1719, the management of the Mint was handed over to Law’s\nCompany; and he was thus enabled to manipulate the coinage. In the\nsame year he had undertaken to pay off the French National Debt, and\nso become the sole creditor of the Nation. He already exercised the\nfunctions of Receiver General and had revenue-farming abolished in its\r\nfavour. He now controlled the collection and disposal of the whole of\nthe State taxation. At this stage of his adventure, Law seemed a good\nfiscal administrator. He repealed or reduced pressing taxes on useful\ncommodities, and reduced the price of necessaries by forty per cent.\nso that the peasants could increase the value of their holdings and\ntheir crops without fear of coming later into the remorseless grip of\r\nthe tax-farmer under the infamous _metayer_ system. Free-trade was in\nthe Provinces practically established. This, so far as it went, was all\nLaw’s doing. Turgot, who later got credit for what had been done, only\ncarried out what the Scotch financier had planned.\n\nLaw had promised high dividends to the speculators in his scheme, and\nhad so far paid them; so it was no wonder that “The System” raised its\nhead again. In 1719-20, all France seemed to flock to Paris to such a","degree and with such unanimity of purpose, that it was difficult to\nobtain room to go on with the necessary work of the Mississippi Scheme.\nIn such matters, resting on human greed which throws all prudence to\nthe winds, the pressure is always towards the centre; and the narrow\nstreet of Quin cam poix became a seething mass, day and night, of\nspeculators in a hurry to buy shares. The time for trying to sell them\nhad not yet arrived.\r\nNaturally such a locality rose in value, and as demand emphasises\npaucity of space, extraordinary prices ruled. Even a small share in\nthe lucky street, where fortunes could be made in an hour, rose to\nfabulous value. Houses formerly letting for forty pounds a year now\nfetched eight hundred pounds per month. And no wonder, when shares of\nthe face value of five hundred livres sold for ten thousand! When there\nis such an overwhelming desire to buy, then is the opportunity for\r\nsellers to realise, and the time for such speculation on the one side,\nand for such commerce on the other, is naturally short and the need\npressing.\n\nAt the beginning of 1720 everything seemed to be increasing in a sort\nof geometric ratio. After a dividend of forty per cent. had been\ndeclared, shares of five hundred value rose to eighteen thousand.\nGreed, and the opportunity for satisfying its craving, turned the\nheads of ordinarily sensible people. The whole world seemed mad. It\r\nappeared right enough that the financial wonder-worker who had created\nsuch a state of things should be loaded with additional honours. It\nwas only scriptural that he who had already multiplied his talents\nshould be entrusted with more. There was universal rejoicing when\nJohn Law--exiled foreigner and condemned murderer--was appointed, in\nJanuary, 1720, Controller-General of the whole finances of France.\nNaturally enough, even the hard head of the canny Scot began to\r\nmanifest symptoms of giving way in the shape of becoming _exalté_. And\nnaturally enough his enemies--financial, political and racial--did not\nlose the opportunities afforded them of taking advantage of it. Tongues\nbegan to wag, and all sorts of rumours, some of them reconcilable with\ncommon sense and easily credible, others outrageous, began to go about.\nLord Stair reported that Law had boasted that he would raise France on","the ruins of England and Holland, to a greater height than she had ever\nreached; that he could crush the East India Company and even destroy\nBritish trade and credit when he chose. Stair resented this, and he and\nLaw from being close friends became enemies. To appease the incensed\nand at present all-powerful Law, the powers that were recalled Lord\nStair.\n\nOn 23 February 1720, the _Compagnie des Indes_ and the _Banque Royale_\r\nwere united, thus linking the ends of the financial chain. “The System”\nwas now complete.\n\nWhen Aladdin set the Genius, who had hitherto worked so willingly, the\nfinal task of hanging a roc’s egg in the centre of the newly-created\npalace, he brought the whole structure tumbling about his ears. So it\nwas with John Law and the egregious Mississippi Scheme. His idea was\ncomplete and perfect. But the high sun when it reaches its meridianal\nsplendour begins from that instant its downward course.\r\nThe reaction was not long in manifesting itself. Usually in such\nmatters there is a pause before the great driving-wheels reverse\ntheir motion, and the backward motion, beginning slowly, gathers way\nas it progresses. But in this case human intelligence and not soulless\nmachinery was the propulsive force of reaction. The speculators had\nbegun to work before the onward movement had come to an end or even\nbegun to slacken. They were loaded up with a vast amount of stocks\r\nwhose value, even if there had been money to redeem them, was severely\nlimited, whereas they had purchased at prices varying between the\nfirst rise above nominal value and that reached by the last desperate\nspeculator. It is not wise to hold such inflated stock too long, and in\na crisis sailing-master Wisdom orders Quarter-master Caution to take\na trick at the helm. When the bare idea of unification of financial\ninterests was mooted, the wise holders of stock commenced to unload.\r\nWhen this movement began its progress was rapid--so long as there was\nanything to be moved. The first class to feel it were the bankers. The\nspecie ran out like the pent-up water from a burst reservoir, till in\nan incredibly short time there was not sufficient remaining to afford\nthe money-change needed in daily life. The advisers and officials of\nthe State, seriously alarmed, began at once to take strong measures","supported by royal decrees. Then as ruin began to stare the whole\nnation in the face more and more with every hour, desperate expedients\nwere resorted to. The value of the currency was made by every\nstratagem, dishonest trick, and unscrupulous exercise of power, to\nfluctuate so that such differences or margins as arose might be grasped\nforthwith for national use. Payments in bullion, except for very small\namounts, were forbidden. The possession of anything over five hundred\r\nlivres in specie was deemed an offence punishable by confiscation,\npartial or wholesale, and by fine. Domiciliary visits were paid to seek\nevidence of offence and to enforce the new laws, and informers in this\nconnection were well paid.\n\nThen began a war, between public oppression and individual trickery,\nto defend acquired rights and evade unjust demands. The holders of\npaper money, unable to realise in specie, tried to protect themselves\r\nby purchasing goods of intrinsic value. Precious metals, jewels, and\nsuch like were bought in such quantities that the supplies diminished\nand the prices grew, until to avoid immediate ruin, such purchases\nwere proclaimed illegal and prohibited. Then ordinary commodities of\nlesser values were tried as means of barter, till their prices too\nrose to such an extent that trade was paralysed. In order to meet the\ngrowing danger a still more desperate expedient was resorted to. A\r\ndecree was issued the effect of which would be to reduce--gradually\nit was hoped--the obligation of bank notes to one-half their nominal\nvalue. This completed the panic, for here was a position which could\nnot be guarded against by any prudence or wisdom. No one could\nhenceforth by any possibility be financially safe. The speculators who\nhad already realised were alone safe. _Bona fide_ investors, if not\nalready overwhelmed by disaster, saw the tide of ruin rising rapidly\r\naround them. Nothing within the power of the state could now be done\nto check or even lessen the state of panic; not even the reversal of\nthe late decree in ten days after its issue. To make matters still\nworse the Banque at this very time suspended payment. Probably in\na wild endeavour to do _something_ which would avert odium from\nitself by saddling the responsibility on someone else, the Government\nprocured the dismissal of Law from the Controller-Generalship of","Finance. However--strange to say--he was very soon appointed by the\nRegent as Intendant-General of Commerce and Director of the ruined\nbank. The much-vaunted, idolised, and believed-in “System” had now\nfallen hopelessly and was ruined forever. Law was everywhere attacked\nand insulted with such unmitigated rancour that he had to leave the\ncountry. He had invested the bulk of the great fortune which he had by\nnow acquired, in estates in France; and these together with everything\r\nelse that he had were now confiscated.\n\nAt the end of the same year, 1720, whilst he was at Brussels he was\nasked by the command of the Czar (Peter), to administer the finances of\nRussia, but declined. After this episode, grateful to a broken man, he\nspent a couple of years wandering about Italy and Germany and probably\ngaming a fluctuating income through gambling. Next he was to be found\nin Copenhagen where he had sought sanctuary from his creditors. Next\r\nyear there was an outward change in his status, when he went to\nEngland, on a ship of war, at the invitation of the Government. There\nhe was presented to George I. Somewhat to his chagrin he was denounced\nin the House of Lords as a Catholic--(he had abjured his old belief of\nProtestantism before accepting the high office of Controller-General\nof Finances in 1720)--and an adherent of the Pretender. He pleaded in\nthe King’s Bench the Royal pardon for the murder of Beau Austin which\r\nhad been sent to him in 1719. He spent the succeeding few years in\nEngland whence he corresponded with the Duke of Orleans. He expected\nto be recalled to France but his hope was never realised. He wished to\ngo to the Continent but was practically a prisoner in England, fearing\nto leave it lest he should be arrested by his creditors, amongst whom\nwas the new French East India Company which had been reconstructed on\r\nthe ruins of the old. In 1725 Sir Robert Walpole, then Prime Minister,\nasked Lord Townshend, the Secretary of State, to give Law a King’s\ncommission of some sort, so that such might serve for his protection.\nIn the same year he went to Italy. He died in Venice in 1729, in what,\ncompared with his former state, was poverty. To the last he was a\ngambler, always ready to take long risks for a prospect, however\nremote, of large gain. A story is told that in his last years he","wagered his last thousand pounds to a shilling (20,000 to 1) against\nthe throwing of double sixes six consecutive times. The law of chances\nwas with him and naturally he won. He renewed his wager but the\nauthorities would not allow the further gamble to take place.\n\nJohn Law married, quite early in life, the daughter of the Earl of\nBanbury and widow of Mr. Seignior. His widow died in 1747. Some of\nthe members of his family were not undistinguished; his son died a\r\nColonel in the Austrian service; and one of his nephews became Comte de\nLauriston and rose to be a General in the French army and Aide-de-Camp\nto the first Napoleon. He was made a Marshal of France by Louis XVIII.\n\nJohn Law was a handsome and distinguished-looking man, blonde, with\nsmall dark grey eyes and fresh complexion. He made an agreeable\nimpression on strangers. Saint-Simon, the social historian, gave him a\ngood character: “innocent of greed and knavery, a mild good man whom\r\nfortune had not spoilt.” Others of his time regarded him as a pioneer\nof modern statesmanship.\n\nHow is it then that such a man must be set down an impostor? In\nhistorical perspective as an impostor he must be regarded, though not\nas such in the narrowest view. The answer is that his very prominence\nsits amongst his judges. Lesser men, and greater men of lesser\nposition, might well stand excused in matters wherein he is accorded\r\ncondemnation.\n\n    “That in the Captain’s but a choleric word\n    Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.”\n\nIf, when a man plays a game wherein life and death and the fortunes\nof many thousands are involved, it behoves him to be at least\ncareful, much greater is his responsibility where the prosperity\nand happiness of nations are at stake. Had Law merely started new\ntheories of finance, and had they gone wrong, he might well claim,\r\nand be accorded, excuse. But his were inventions of what, in modern\nslang, is called “get-rich-quick” principles. Not only did Law not\nenrich human life--with one exception, that of enlarging the currency\nin use--or add to the sum total of human well-being and happiness; he\neven neglected to show that forethought and consideration for others\nwhich in all honour ought to be exercised by the deviser and controller\nof great risks. He was a gambler, and a gambler only. He merely put","into the pockets of some persons that which he had taken out of the\npockets of others; and in doing so showed no consideration for the\npoor, the thrifty, the needy--for any of those whose contentment and\nhappiness depend on such as are in high places and dowered in some\nway with productive powers. The soulless uneducated churl who does an\nhonest day’s work does more for humanity than the genius who merely\nshifts about the already garnered wealth of ages. John Law posed as\r\na benefactor and accepted all the benefits that accrued to him from\nthe praises of those who followed in his wake and gleaned the rich\nwastage of his empire-moving theories and schemes. Financiers of Law’s\ntype no more benefit a country or enrich a people than do the hordes\nof wasters and “tape”-betting men who prey on labour as locusts do on\nthe crops. If they wish not to do unnecessary harm--which is putting\ntheir duty at the lowest possible estimate--they should at least try to\r\navoid repeating the errors which have wrecked others. A brief glance at\nthe wreckage which lay well within the Scotch gambler’s vision, will\nshow how he shut his eyes deliberately not only to facts, but to the\nmany correlations of cause and effect. Before his Mississippi Scheme\nwas formulated, there had been experience of banking enterprises, of\nschemes for mercantile combination and for the exploitation of capital,\nof adventurous dealings in the developments of countries new and more\r\nor less savage, East and West and South.\n\nThe following list will typify. Of all these John Law had knowledge\nsufficient to judge of difficulties to be encountered in the early\nstages, of dangers not only incidental to the things themselves, but\nbased deep in human nature.\n\n  The East India Company founded in 1600\n  The Bank of England founded in 1694\n  The Africa Company founded in 1695\n  The Darien Company founded in 1695\r\nA glance at each of these, all of which were within the scope and\nknowledge of Law, their aims, formation and development, up to the time\nspoken of, can hardly fail to be illuminative. The sixteenth century\nhad been an age of adventure and discovery; the seventeenth of the\nfoundation of great commercial enterprise, of conception of ideas, of\nthe constructive beginnings of things. The time for development had\ncome with the eighteenth; and now care and forethought, prudence and","resource, were the preparations for success.\n\nThe East India Company was in reality the pioneer of corporate\ntrading, and as for nearly a hundred years it was in a measure alone\nin its scale of magnitude, its experiences could well serve as\nexemplar, guide, and danger signal. It was based on that surest of all\nundertakings, natural growth. It came into existence because it was\nwanted, and from no other cause. Its very name, its modest capital, its\r\nself-protective purpose make for understanding.\n\nIn its Charter of Incorporation its purpose was indicated in the name:\n“The Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading to the East\nIndies.” Its capital was £70,000, which though a large sum for those\ndays, was, according to our modern lights, an almost ridiculously small\nsum for the object then before it, and to which it ultimately attained.\nThe time was ripe for just such an undertaking.\r\nThe Peace of Vervins (1598) which left both France and Spain free\nto look after their domestic concerns, was immediately followed by\nthe Edict of Nantes (1599) which gave religious liberty to France,\nand such a new freedom is always followed by national expansion.\nBy this time Spain--the explorer or conqueror--and Holland--the\npatient organiser--held Eastern commerce in their hands. England\nhad been gradually making a commerce of her own in the Indies, and\r\nall that was required was an official acknowledgment, so that the\nthunder of her guns should, when required, follow the creaking of her\ncordage. From the story of this great enterprise, through its first\ntwenty-five years, could be drawn the lesson of such schemes as Law\nwas now formulating. Though it had succeeded, in spite of Dutch and\nPortuguese opposition, in establishing “factories” when the historic\nmassacre by the Dutch at Amboyna in the Molucca Islands, took place\r\nin 1725, the Eastern Company seemed near its dissolution. It was not\ntill the establishment of the Hooghly factory in 1742 that things\nbegan to look up. After that, fortune favoured the Company more\nthan she had appeared likely to do at the start. The marriage of\nCharles II to Catherine of Braganza in 1661 brought progress in its\ntrain. Catherine’s dower, which included Bombay and so put a part of\nPortugal’s later possessions in British keeping, greatly stimulated the","East India Company which thenceforth was able to weather the storms\nthat threatened or assailed. The privilege of making war on its own\naccount, conceded by Charles II, gave the Company a national importance\nwhich was destined to consolidate its interests with those of England\nitself. So strong did it become that before the end of the eighteenth\ncentury it was able to resist the attack on its charter made by a\npowerful and progressive rival, the “New Company.” The rivals, after a\r\nfew years of _pourparlers_ and tentative efforts, were united in 1708;\nand thenceforth the amalgamation, under the title “The United Company\nof Merchants of England trading to the East Indies,” was practically\nunassailable on its own account. It was additionally safe in that it\nhad the protection of the great Whig Party under Godolphin. The capital\nof the Company, now enlarged to £3,200,000, was lent to the Government\r\nat five per cent. interest and was finally merged in the National\nFunds. The history of the Company, after 1717 does not belong here, as\nit is only considered as showing that John Law had the experience of an\nearlier Company similar to his own to guide him in its management if he\nhad chosen to avail himself of it.\n\nThe Bank of England was, strangely enough, the project of a Scotchman,\nWilliam Paterson. The plan was submitted to Government in 1691 but\r\nwas not carried into existence for three years. It was purely a\nbusiness concern, brought into effective existence through the needs\nof commerce, the opportunity afforded being the need of the State\nand the concern of the statesman. It had a capital at first of over\n£1,200,000, which was loaned to the nation on the security of the taxes\nwhen the Charter was signed, there being certain safeguards against\nthe possibility of political misuse. The Controlling Board was to have\r\ntwenty-five members who were to be elected annually by the stockholders\nwith a substantial qualification. There were at this time in England\nprivate banks; but this was an effort to formulate the banking\nrights, duties, and powers of capital under the ægis of the State\nitself. But even so sound a venture, enormously popular from the very\nfirst and with the whole might of the nation behind it, had its own\ndifficulties to encounter. Its instantaneous success was an incentive","to other adventurers; and the co-operation with government which it\nmade manifest created jealousy with private persons and commercial\nconcerns. Within two years its very existence was threatened, first by\nthe individual hostility of those in the bullion trade, who already\nacted as bankers, and then by a rival concern incorporated under strong\npolitical support. This was the National Land Bank whose purpose was\nto use the security of real estate as a guarantee for the paper money\r\nwhich it issued for convenient usage. Strong as the Bank of England\nwas by its nature, its popularity, and its support, it was in actual\ndanger until the rival which had never “caught on”--to use an apposite\nAmericanism--actually and almost instantaneously collapsed.\n\nThe safety thus temporarily obtained was purchased at the cost to the\nGovernment of a further loan of two million sterling--with the value to\nthe contra of an alliance thus begun with the Whig ministry.\r\nA further danger came from the mad and maddening South Sea Scheme five\nyears later; but from which it was happily saved solely through the\ngreater cupidity and daring of the newer company.\n\nThe Darien Company, which followed hard on the heels of The African\nCompany, was formed in 1695, by Paterson; on the base of An Act of the\nScottish Parliament for the purpose of making an opening for Scottish\ncapital after the manner of the East India Company by which English\r\nenterprise had already so largely benefited. Its career was of such\nshort duration and its failure so complete that there was little\ndifficulty in understanding the causes of its collapse. It might\nserve for a _pendant_ of Lamb’s criticism of the meat that was “ill\nfed and ill killed, ill kept and ill cooked.” The Company was started\nto utilise, in addition to exploiting new lands, the waste of time,\nenergy and capital, between West and East; and yet it was not till the\r\nfirst trading fleet was sailing that its objective was made known to\nthe adventurers. Its ideas of trading were those of a burlesque, and\nits materials of barter with tropical savages on the criminal side of\nthe ludicrous--bibles, heavy woollen stuffs and periwigs! Naturally\na couple of years finished its working existence and “The rest is\nsilence.” And yet at the inception of the scheme two great nations vied","with one another for its control.\n\nThere are those who may say that John Law was not an impostor, but\na great financier who made a mistake. Financiers must not make\nmistakes--or else they must be classed amongst the impostors; for they\ndeal with the goods and prospects of others as well as their own.\nLaw was simply a gambler on a great scale. He led a nation, through\nits units, to believe that the following of his ideas would lead to\r\nsuccess. Financial schemes without good ideas and practical working to\ncarry them out are deceptive and destructive. The Mississippi Scheme\nis a case in point. If the original intention had been carried out\nin its entirety--which involved vast pioneering and executive action\nof present and future generations, and an almost absolute foregoing\nof immediate benefits--the result would have been of immense service\nto the successors in title of the original ventures. The assessable\r\nvalue of the real estate conveyed under the Mississippi Scheme to-day\nequals more than a third of the present gigantic National Debt of\nFrance, swollen though the latter is by the Napoleonic wars, the war\nwith Austria, the cost and indemnity of the war with Germany, and, in\naddition, by the long wars with England and Russia.\n\nIf human beings had been angels, content with the prospect of gains in\nthe distant future, Law’s schemes might have succeeded. As it was, he,\r\nworking for his own purposes with an imperfect humanity, can only be\njudged by results.\n\n\n\n\nV. WITCHCRAFT AND CLAIRVOYANCE\n\nA. THE PERIOD\n\n\nFor convenience, the masculine offender is in demonology classed under\nthe female designation. According to Michelet and other authorities\nthere were ten thousand alleged witches for each alleged wizard! and\nanyhow there is little etiquette as to the precedence of ladies in\ncriminal matters.\n\nThe first English Statute dealing directly with witches appears to be\r\nthe thirty-third of Henry VIII (1541) which brought into the list of\nfelonies persons “devising or practising conjurations, witchcraftes,\nsorcerie or inchantments or the digging up of corpses,” and depriving\nsuch of the benefit of clergy. It was however repealed by I Edward VI\nCap. 12, and again by I Mary (in its first section.). Queen Elizabeth,\nhowever, passed another Act (5 Elizabeth Cap. 16) practically repeating\nthat of her father, which had been in abeyance for more than thirty","years. The Statute of Elizabeth is exceedingly interesting in that it\nstates the condition of the law at that time. The opening words leave\nno misunderstanding:\n\n    “Whereas at this day there is no ordinary nor condigne punishment\n    provided against the wicked offences of conjurations or\n    invocations of evil spirits, or of sorceries, inchantments,\n    charmes or witchcraftes, which be practised to the obstruction\r\nof the persons and goods of the Queene’s subjects, or for other\n    lewd purposes. Be it enacted that if any person or persons\n    after the first day of June next coming, shall use practice, or\n    exercise any invocations, or conjurations, of evill or wicked\n    spirits, to or for any intent or purpose, or else if any person\n    or persons after the said first day of June shall use, practice\n    or exercise any witchcraft, enchantment, charme or sorcerie,\r\nwhereby any person shall happen to be killed or destroied, that\n    then as well every such offendour or offendours in invocations,\n    or conjurations, as is aforesayde, their aydours and counsellors,\n    as also everie such offendour or offendours in that Witchcrafte,\n    enchantment, charme or sorcerie whereby the death of any person\n    doth ensue, their ayders and counsellors, being of eyther of\n    the sayde offences lawfully convicted and attainted, shall\r\nsuffer paines of death, as a felon or felons, and shall lose the\n    privilege and benefit of Clergy and sanctuary,” &c.\n\nIn this act lesser penalties are imposed for using any form of\nwitchcraft or sorcery, for inducing to any persons harm, or to “provoke\nany person to unlawfull love or to hurt or destroy any person in his\nor her bodye, member or goods,” or for the discovery or recovery of\ntreasure. From that time down to the first quarter of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, when the law practically died out, witchcraft had its place in\nthe category of legal offences. The law was finally repealed by an Act\nin the tenth year of George II. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\nwere the time of witch-fever, and in that period, especially in its\nearlier days when the belief had become epidemic, it was ruthless and\ndestructive. It is said that in Genoa five hundred persons were burned","within three months in the year 1515, and a thousand in the diocese of\nComo in a year. Round numbers in such matters are to be distrusted,\nas we find they seldom bear investigation; but there is little doubt\nthat in France and Germany vast numbers suffered and perished. Even in\nmore prosaic and less emotional England there were many thousands of\njudicial murders in this wise. It is asserted that within two centuries\nthey totalled thirty thousand.\r\nIt is startling to find such a weird and impossible credulity actually\nrooted in the Statute book of one’s own country, and that there are\nrecords of judges charging juries to convict. Sir Matthew Hale, a great\nlawyer, a judge of the Common Pleas in 1654, and Lord Chief Justice in\n1671, was a firm believer in witchcraft. He was a grave and pious man,\nand all his life was an ardent student of theology as well as of law.\nAnd yet in 1664 he sentenced women to be burned as witches. In 1716 a\r\nmother and daughter--the latter only nine years of age--were hanged in\nHuntingdon. In Scotland the last case of a woman being condemned as a\nwitch occurred at Dornoch in 1722.\n\nIt is no easy task in these days, which are rationalistic, iconoclastic\nand enquiring, to understand how the commonalty not only believed\nin witchcraft but acted on that belief. Probably the most tolerant\nview we can take, is that both reason and enquiry are essential\r\nand rudimentary principles of human nature. Every person of normal\nfaculties likes to know and understand the reasons of things;\nand inquisitiveness is not posterior to the period of maternal\nalimentation. If we seek for a cause we are bound to find one--even\nif it be wrong. _Omne ignotum pro magnifico_ has a wide if not always\na generous meaning; and when fear is founded on, if not inspired by\nignorance, that unthinking ferocity which is one of our birthrights\r\nfrom Adam is apt to carry us further than we ever meant to go. In an\nage more clear-seeing than our own and less selfish we shall not think\nso poorly of primitive emotions as we are at present apt to. On the\ncontrary we shall begin to understand that in times when primitivity\nholds sway, we are most in touch with the loftiest things we are\ncapable of understanding, and our judgment, being complex, is most\nexact. Indeed in this branch of the subject persons used to call to aid","a special exercise of our natural forces--the æsthetic. When witchcraft\nwas a belief, the common idea was that that noxious power was almost\nentirely held by the old and ugly. The young, fresh, and beautiful,\nwere seldom accepted as witches save by the novelty-loving few or\nthose of sensual nature. This was perhaps fortunate--if the keeping\ndown of the population in this wise was necessary; it is easier as\nwell as safer to murder the uncomely than those of greater charm. In\r\nany case there was no compunction about obliterating the former class.\nThe general feeling was much the same as that in our own time which in\nsporting circles calls for the destruction of vermin.\n\nIt will thus be seen that the profession of witchcraft, if occasionally\nlucrative, was nevertheless always accompanied with danger and\nexecration. This was natural enough since the belief which made\nwitchcraft dangerous was based on fear. It is not too much to say that\r\nin every case, professed witchcraft was an expression of fraudulent\nintent. Such pity, therefore, as the subject allows of must be confined\nto the guiltless victims who, despite blameless life, were tried by\npassion, judged by frenzy, and executed by remorseless desperation.\nThere could be no such thing as quantitative analysis of guilt with\nregard to the practice of witchcraft: any kind of playing with the\nsubject was a proof of _some_ kind of wrongful intent, and was to be\r\njudged with Draconian severity. Doubtless it was a very simple way\nof dealing with evils, much resembling the medical philosophy of the\nChinese. The whole logic of it can be reduced to a sorites. Any change\nfrom the normal is the work of the devil--or _a_ devil as the case\nmay be. Find out the normal residence of that especial devil--which\nis in some human being. Destroy the devil’s dwelling. You get rid of\nthe devil. It is pure savagery of the most primitive kind. And it\r\nis capable of expansion, for logic is a fertile plant, and when its\npremises are wrong it has the fecundity of a weed. Before even a savage\ncan have time to breathe, his logic is piling so fast on him that he\nis smothered. If a human being is a devil then the club which destroys\nhim or her is an incarnation of good, and so a god to be worshipped in\nsome form--or at any rate to be regarded with esteem, like a sword,","or a legal wig, or a stethoscope, or a paint-brush, or a shovel,\nor a compass, or a drinking-vessel, or a pen. If all the necessary\nconditions of life and sanity and comfort were on so primitive a base,\nwhat an easy world it would be to live in!\n\nOne benefit there was in witchcraft, though it was not recognised\nofficially as such at the time. It created a new industry--a whole\ncrop of industries. It is of the nature of belief that it encourages\r\nbelief--not always of exactly the same kind--but of some form which\nintelligence can turn into profit. We cannot find any good in the new\nindustry--grapes do not grow on thorns nor figs on thistles. The sum\nof human happiness was in no sense augmented; but at least a good deal\nof money or money’s worth changed hands; which, after all, is as much\nas most of the great financiers can point to as the result of long and\nstrenuous success. In the organisation of this form of crime there were\r\nmany classes, of varying risks and of benefits in inverse ratio to\nthem. For the ordinary rule of finance holds even here: large interest\nmeans bad security. First there were the adventurers themselves who\ntook the great risks of life and its collaterals--esteem, happiness,\n&c. The money obtained by this class was usually secured by fraudulent\nsales of worthless goods or by the simple old financial device of\nblackmail. Then there were those who were in reality merely parasites\r\non the pleasing calling--those timorous souls who let “‘I dare not’\nwait upon ‘I would’ like the poor cat i’ the adage.” These were\naltogether in a poorer way of trade than their bolder brothers and\nsisters. They lacked courage, and sometimes even sufficient malice\nfor the proper doing of their work; with the result that success\nseldom attended them at all, and never heartily. But at any rate they\ncould not complain of inadequate punishment; whenever religious zeal\r\nflamed up they were generally prominent victims. They can in reality\nonly be regarded as specimens of parasitic growth. Then there came\nthe class known in French criminal circles as _agents provocateurs_,\nwhose business was not only to further ostensible crime but to work\nup the opposition against it. Either branch of their art would\nprobably be inadequate; but by linking their services they managed to\neke out a livelihood. Lastly there was the lowest grade of all, the","Witch-finder--a loathly calling, comparable only to the class or guild\nof “paraskistae” or “rippers” in the ritual of the Mummy industry of\nancient Egypt.\n\nOf these classes we may I think consider some choice specimens--so\nfar as we may fittingly investigate the _personnel_ of a by-gone\nindustry. Of the main body, that of Wizards and Witches or those\npretending to the cult, let us take Doctor Dee and Madame Voisin, and\nSir Edward Kelley and Mother Damnable--thus representing the method of\r\nthe procession of the unclean animals from the Ark. Of the class of\nWitchfinders one example will probably be as much as we can stand, and\nwe will naturally take the one who obtained fame in his calling--namely\nMatthew Hopkins, who stands forth like Satan, “by merit raised to that\nbad eminence.”\n\n\n\n\nB. DOCTOR DEE\n\n\nEven a brief survey of the life of the celebrated “Doctor Dee,” the\nso-called “Wizard” of the sixteenth century, will leave any honest\r\nreader under the impression that in the perspective of history he was\na much maligned man. If it had not been that now and again he was led\ninto crooked bye-paths of alleged occultism, his record might have\nstood out as that of one of the most accomplished and sincere of the\nscientists of his time. He was in truth, whatever were his faults,\nmore sinned against than sinning. If the English language is not so\nelastic as some others in the matter of meaning of phrases, the same\r\nor a greater effect can be obtained by a careful use of the various\ndialects of the British Empire. In the present case we may, if English\nlacks, well call on some of the varieties of Scotch terminology.\nThe intellectual status of the prime wizard, as he is held to be in\ngeneral opinion, can be well indicated by any of the following words\nor phrases “wanting,” “crank,” “a tile off,” “a wee bit saft,” “a bee\nin his bonnet.” Each of these is indicative of some form of monomania,\r\ngenerally harmless. If John Dee had not had some great qualities, such\nnegative weaknesses would have prevented his reputation ever achieving\na permanent place in history of any kind. As it is his place was won by\nmany accomplished facts. The following is a broad outline of his life,\nwhich was a long one lasting for over eighty years.\n\nJohn Dee was born in 1527, and came of a Welsh race. A good many years\nafter his start in life he, after the harmless fashion of those (and","other) times, made out a family tree in which it was shewn that he was\ndescended from, among other royalties, Roderick the Great, Prince of\nWales. This little effort of vanity did not, however, change anything.\nThe world cared then about such things almost as little as it does\nnow; or, allowing for the weakness of human beings in the way of their\nown self-importance, it might be better to say as it professes to do\r\nnow. John Dee was sent to the University of Cambridge when he was only\nfifteen years old. The College chosen for him was St. John’s, and here\nhe showed extraordinary application in his chosen subject, mathematics.\nHe took his probationary degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1545, and was\nmade a Fellow in 1546. In his early years of College life his work was\nregulated in a remarkable way. Out of the twenty-four hours, eighteen\nwere devoted to study, four to sleep, the remaining two being set\r\napart for meals and recreation. Lest this should seem incredible it\nmay be remembered that three hundred years later, the French Jesuits,\nhaving made exhaustive experiments, arrived at the conclusion that for\nmere purposes of health, without making any allowance for the joy or\nhappiness of life, and treating the body merely as a machine from which\nthe utmost amount of work mental and physical could be got without\ninjury, four hours of sleep per diem sufficed for health and sanity.\r\nAnd it is only natural that a healthy and ambitious young man trying to\nwork his way to success would, or might have been, equally strenuous\nand self-denying. His appointment as Fellow of St. John’s was one of\nthose made when the College was founded. That he was skilled in other\nbranches of learning was shown by the fact that in the University he\nwas appointed as Under Reader in Greek. He was daring in the practical\r\napplication of science, and during the representation of one of the\ncomedies of Aristophanes, created such a sensation by appearing to fly,\nthat he began to be credited by his companions with magical powers.\nThis was probably the beginning of the sinister reputation which seemed\nto follow him all his life afterwards. When once an idea of the kind\nhas been started even the simplest facts of life and work seem to\ngather round it and enlarge it indefinitely. So far as we can judge","after a lapse of over three hundred years, John Dee was an eager and\nardent seeker after knowledge; and all through his life he travelled\nin the search wherever he was likely to gain his object. It is a main\ndifficulty of following such a record that we have only facts to\nfollow. We know little or nothing of motives except from results, and\nas in the development of knowledge the measure of success can only\nbear a small ratio to that of endeavour, it is manifest that we should\r\nshow a large and tolerant understanding of the motives which animate\nthe seeker for truth. In the course of his long life John Dee visited\nmany lands, sojourned in many centres of learning, had relations of\ncommon interests as well as of friendship with many great scholars,\nand made as thinker, mathematician, and astronomer, a reputation far\ntranscending any ephemeral and purely gaseous publicity arising from\r\nthe open-mouthed wonder of the silly folk who are not capable of even\ntrying to understand things beyond their immediate ken. Wherever he\nwent he seems to have been in touch with the learned and progressive\nmen of his time, and always a student. At various times he was in\nthe Low Countries, Louvain (from whose University he obtained the\ndegree of LL.D.), Paris, Wurtemberg, Antwerp, Presburg, Lorraine,\nFrankfort-on-the-Oder, Bohemia, Cracow, Prague, and Hesse-Cassel. He\r\neven went so far afield as St. Helena. He was engaged on some great\nworks of more than national importance. For instance, when in 1582,\nPope Gregory XIII instituted the reform of the Calendar which was\nadopted by most of the great nations of the world, Dee approved and\nworked out his own calculations to an almost similar conclusion,\nthough the then opposition to him cost England a delay of over one\nhundred and seventy years. In 1572 he had proved his excellence as an\r\nastronomer in his valuable work in relation to a newly discovered star\n(Tycho Brahe’s) in Cassiopœia. In 1580 he made a complete geographical\nand hydrographical map of the Queen’s possessions. He tried--but\nunhappily in vain--to get Queen Mary to gather the vast collections\nof manuscripts and old books which had been made in the Monasteries\n(broken up by Henry VIII) of which the major part were then to be\nobtained both easily and cheaply. He was a Doctor of Laws (which","by the way was his only claim to be called “Doctor” Dee, the title\ngenerally accorded to him). He was made a rector in Worcestershire in\n1553; and in 1556, Archbishop Parker gave him ten years’ use of the\nlivings of Upton and Long Leadenham. He was made Warden of Manchester\nCollege in 1595, and was named by Queen Elizabeth as Chancellor of St.\nPaul’s. In 1564, he was appointed Dean of Gloucester, though through\nhis own neglect of his own interest it was never carried out. The\r\nQueen approved, the Archbishop sealed the deed; but Dee, unmindful,\noverlooked the formality of acceptance and the gift eventually went\nelsewhere. Queen Elizabeth, who consistently believed in and admired\nhim, wanted to make him a bishop, but he declined the responsibility.\nFor once the formality at consecration: “_Nolo Episcopari_” was spoken\nwith truthful lips. More than once he was despatched to foreign places\nto make special report in the Queen’s service. That he did not--always,\r\nat all events--put private interest before public duty is shown by his\nrefusal to accept two rectories offered to him by the Queen in 1576,\nurging as an excuse that he was unable to find time for the necessary\nduties, since he was too busily occupied in making calculations for\nthe reformation of the Calendar. He seems to have lived a most proper\nlife, and was twice married. After a long struggle with adversity in\r\nwhich--last despair of a scholar--he had to sell his books, he died\nvery poor, just as he was preparing to migrate. At his death in 1608\nhe left behind him no less than seventy-nine works--nearly one for\neach year of his life. Just after the time of the Armada, following on\nsome correspondence with Queen Elizabeth, he had returned to England\nafter long and adventurous experiences in Poland and elsewhere, during\nwhich he had known what it was to receive the honours and affronts of\r\ncommunities. He took back with him the reputation of being a sorcerer,\none which he had never courted and which so rankled in him that many\nyears afterwards he petitioned James I to have him tried so that he\nmight clear his character.\n\nIf there be any truth whatever in the theory that men have attendant\nspirits, bad as well as good, Dr. Dee’s bad spirit took the shape of\none who pretended to occult knowledge, the so-called Sir Edward Kelley","of whom we shall have something to say later on.\n\nDee was fifty-four years of age when he met Sir Edward Kelley who was\ntwenty-eight years his junior. The two men became friends, and then\nthe old visionary scholar at once became dominated by his younger and\nless scrupulous companion, who very soon became his partner. From that\ntime Dee’s down-fall--or rather down-_slide_ began. All the longings\nafter occult belief which he had hitherto tried to hold in check began\r\nnot only to manifest themselves, but to find expression. His science\nbecame merged in alchemy, his astronomical learning was forced into\nthe service of Astrology. His belief, which he as a cleric held before\nhim as a duty, was lost in spiritualism and other forms of occultism.\nHe began to make use for practical purposes of his crystal globe and\nhis magic mirror in which he probably had for long believed secretly.\nKelley practically ruined his reputation by using for his own purposes\r\nthe influence which he had over the old man. His opportunities were\nincreased by the arrival in England of Laski, about 1583. The two\nscholars had many ideas in common, and Kelley did not fail, in the\nfurtherance of his own views, to take advantage of the circumstance.\nHe persuaded Dee to go with his new friend to Poland, in the hope of\nbenefiting further in his studies in the occult by wider experience\nof foreign centres of learning. They journeyed to Laskoe near Cracow,\r\nwhere the weakness of the English scholar became more evident and his\nform of madness more developed. Dee had now a fixed belief in two\nideas which he had hitherto failed to materialise--the Philosopher’s\nStone and the Elixir of Life, both of them dreams held as possible of\nrealisation to the scientific dreamer in the period of the Renaissance.\nDee believed at one time that he had got hold of the Philosopher’s\nStone, and actually sent to Queen Elizabeth a piece of gold taken from\r\na transmuted warming-pan. As it is said in the life of Dee that he\nand Kelley had found a quantity of the Elixir of Life in the ruins of\nGlastonbury Abbey, we can easily imagine what part the latter had in\nthe transaction. It was he, too, who probably fixed on Glastonbury as\nthe place in which to search for Elixirs, as that holy spot had already\na reputation of its own in such matters. It has been held for ages that","the staff used by Joseph of Arimathea took root and blossomed there.\nSomehow, whatever the Glastonbury Elixir did, the Philosopher’s Stone\ndid not seem to keep its alleged properties in the Dee family. John\nDee’s young son Arthur, aged eight, tried its efficacy; but without\nsuccess. Perhaps it was this failure which made Kelley more exacting,\nfor a couple of years later in 1589, he told his partner that angels\nhad told him it was the divine wish that they should have their wives\r\nin common. The sage, who was fond of his wife--who was a comely woman,\nwhereas Kelley’s was ill favoured and devoid of charms--naturally\ndemurred at such an utterance even of occult spirits. Mrs. Dee also\nobjected, with the result that there were alarums and excursions and\nthe partnership was rudely dissolved--which is a proof that though the\naged philosopher’s mind had been vitiated by the evil promptings of his\nwily companion he had not quite declined to idiocy.\n\n\n\n\nC. LA VOISIN\r\nIn Paris a woman named Des Hayes Voisin, a widow who had taken up the\nbusiness of a midwife, towards the end of the seventeenth century\nmade herself notorious by the telling of fortunes. Such at least\nwas the manifest occupation of the worthy lady, and as she did not\nflaunt herself unduly, her existence was rather a retired one. Few who\ndid not seek her services knew of her existence, fewer still of her\nresidence. The life of a professor of such mysteries as the doings of\r\nFate--so-called--is prolonged and sweetened by seclusion. But there\nis always an “underground” way of obtaining information for such as\nreally desire it; and Madame Voisin, for all her evasive retirement,\nwas always to be found when wanted--which means when she herself wanted\nto be found. She was certainly a marvellous prophet, within a certain\nrange of that occult art. Like all clever people she fixed limitations\nfor herself; which was wise of her, for to prophesy on behalf of every","one who may yearn for a raising of the curtain, be it of never so small\na corner, on all possible subjects, is to usurp the general functions\nof the Almighty. Wisely therefore, Madame Voisin became a specialist.\nHer subject was husbands; her chief theme their longevity. Naturally\nsuch women as were unsatisfied with the personality, circumstances,\nor fortunes of their partners, joined the mass of her _clientèle_, a\nmass which taking it “bye and large” maintained a strange exactness\r\nof dimensions. This did not much trouble the public, or even the body\nof her clients, for no one except Madame herself knew their numbers.\nIt was certainly a strange thing how accurately Madame guessed, for\nshe had seemingly no data to go on--the longevity of the husbands were\nnever taken into the confidence of the prophet. She took care to keep\nalmost to herself the rare good fortune, in a sense, which attended her\r\ndivination; for ever since the misfortune which had attended the late\nMarquise de Brinvilliers became public, the powers of the law had taken\na quite unnecessary interest in the proceedings of all of her cult.\nLongevity is quite a one-sided arrangement of nature; we can only be\nsure of its accuracy when it is too late to help in its accomplishment.\nIn such a game there is only one throw of the dice, so that it behoves\nanyone who would wager successfully to be very sure that the chances\r\nare in his--or her--favour.\n\nMadame Voisin’s clients were generally in a hurry, and so were willing\nto take any little trouble or responsibility necessary to ensure\nsuccess. They had two qualities which endear customers to those of La\nVoisin’s trade; they were grateful and they were silent. That they\nwere of cheery and hopeful spirit was shown by the fact that as a rule\nthey married again soon after the dark cloud of bereavement had fallen\r\non them. When the funeral baked meats have coldly furnished forth the\nmarriage tables, it is better to remain as inconspicuous as possible;\nfriends and onlookers will take notice, and, when they notice, they\nwill talk. Moreover the new partner is often suspicious and apt to be a\nlittle jealous of his predecessor in title. Thus, Madame Voisin being\nclever and discreet, and her clients being--or at any rate appearing\nto be--happy in their new relations and silent to the world at large,","all went prosperously with the kindly-hearted prophet. No trouble rose\nas to testamentary dispositions. Men who are the subjects of prophecy\nhave usually excellently-drawn wills. This is especially the case with\nhusbands who are no longer young. Young husbands are as a rule not made\nthe subjects of prophecy.\n\nMadame Voisin’s great accuracy of prediction did not excite at the\ntime so much public admiration as it might have done if she or her\r\nclients had taken the public more into their confidence; but it was\nnoted afterwards that in most cases the male individual who retired\nearly from the scene was the senior partner in that _congeries_ of\nthree which has come to be known as “the eternal triangle.” In later\nconversations, following in the wake of the completed prophecy,\nconfidences were exchanged as to the studies in certain matters\nof science in which Madame Voisin seemed to have attained a rare\r\nproficiency.\n\nThe late Mr. Charles Peace, an adventurous if acquisitive spirit, who\ngave up his life in the same manner as the deceased Mr. Haman, worked\nalone during the long period of his professional existence, and with\nmisleading safety. The illustrious French lady-prophet unwisely did\nnot value this form of security, and so multiplied opportunities of\nfailure. She followed an entirely opposite policy, one which though it\r\ndoubtless stood by her on many occasions had a fatal weakness. In some\nways it may facilitate matters if one is one’s own Providence; such\na course avoids temporarily errors of miscalculation or deduction of\nprobable results. And just as the roulette table has certain chances\nin favour of Zero, there is for the practical prophet a large hazard\nin that the dead are unable to speak or to renew effort on a more\nfavourable basis. La Voisin, probably through some unfavourable or\r\nthreatening experiences, saw the wisdom of associating the forces of\nprediction and accomplishment, and with the readiness of an active\npersonality effected the junction. For this she was already fairly\nwell equipped with experiences. Both as a wife and a lover of warm\nand voluptuous nature she understood something of the passions of\nhumanity, on both the female and the male side; and being a woman she\nknew perhaps better of the two the potency of feminine longing. This","did not act so strongly in the lesser and more directly commercial,\nif less uncertain, phases of her art, such as finding lost property,\ndivining the result of hazards, effecting immunity from danger, or the\npreserving indefinitely the more pleasing qualities of youth. But in\nsterner matters, when the issue was of life or death, the masculine\ntendency towards recklessness kicked the beam. As a nurse in active\r\ntouch with both medical and surgical wants, aims, and achievements,\nshe was at ease in the larger risks of daily life. And after all, her\nown ambitions, aided by the compelling of her own natural demands\nfor physical luxury, were quite independent, only seeking through\nexiguous means a way of achievement. In secret she studied the mystery\nof a toxicologist; and, probably by cautious experiment, satisfied\nherself of her proficiency in that little-known science. That she had\r\nother aims, more or less dependent on this or the feelings which its\nknowledge superinduced, can be satisfactorily guessed from some of her\nattendant labours which declared themselves later.\n\nAfter a time La Voisin’s vogue as a sorceress brought her into\ncertain high society where freedom of action was unhampered by moral\nrestraints. The very rich, the leaders of society and fashion of the\ntime, the unscrupulous whose ambitious efforts had been crowned with\r\nsuccess of a kind, leaders of Court life, those in high military\ncommand, mistresses of royalty and high aristocracy--all became\ncompanions and clients in one or more of her mysterious arts. Amongst\nthem were the Duchesse de Bouillon, the Comtesse de Soissons, Madame\nde Montespan, Olympe de Mancini, Marshal de Luxembourg, the Duc de\nVendôme, Prince de Clermont-Lodeve. It was not altogether fashionable\nnot to be in touch with Madame Voisin. Undeterred by the lessons of\r\nhistory, La Voisin went on her way, forced as is usual in such cases by\nthe circumstances which grow around the criminal and prove infinitely\nthe stronger. She was at the height of her success when the public\nsuspicion, followed by action, revealed the terrible crimes of the\nMarquise de Brinvilliers; and she was caught in the tail of the tempest\nthus created.\n\nThis case of Madame de Brinvilliers is a typical one of how a human","being, goaded by passion and lured by opportunity, may fall swiftly\nfrom any estate. It is so closely in touch with that of Madame Voisin\nthat the two have almost to be considered together. They began with the\ndesire for dabbling in forbidden mysteries. Three men--two Italians\nand one German, all men of some ability--were violent searchers for\nthe mythical “philosopher’s stone” which was to fulfil the dream of\nthe mediæval alchemist by turning at will all things into gold. In the\r\nsearch they all gravitated to Paris. There the usual thing happened.\nMoney ran short and foolish hoping had to be supplemented by crime.\nIn the whirling world of the time there was always a ready sale for\nmeans to an end, however nefarious either might be. The easy morality\nof the time allowed opportunity for all means, with the result that\nthere was an almost open dealing in poisons. The soubriquet which stole\ninto existence--it dared not proclaim itself--is a self-explanatory\r\nhistorical lesson. The _poudre de succession_ marks an epoch which,\nfor sheer, regardless, remorseless, profligate wickedness is almost\nwithout peer in history, and this is said without forgetting the time\nof the Borgias. Not even natural affection or family life or individual\nrelationship or friendliness was afforded any consideration. This phase\nof crime, which was one almost confined to the upper and wealthier\nclasses, depended on wealth and laws of heredity and entail. Those who\r\nbenefited by it salved what remnants of conscience still remained to\nthem with the thought that they were but helping the natural process of\nwaste and recuperation. The old and feeble were removed, with as little\ncoil as might be necessary, in order that the young and lusty might\nbenefit. As the change was a form of plunder, which had to be paid\nfor in a degree in some way approximate to results, prices ran high.\r\nPoisoning on a successful scale requires skilful and daring agents,\nwhose after secrecy as well as whose present aid has to be secured.\nExili and Glasser--one of the Italians and the German--did a thriving\ntrade. As usual in such illicit traffic, the possibility of purchase\nunder effective conditions made a market. There is every reason to\nbelieve from after results that La Voisin was one such agent. The cause\nof La Brinvilliers entering the market was the purely personal one of","an affair of sensual passion. Death is an informative circumstance.\nSuspicion began to leak out that the polyglot firm of needy foreigners\nhad dark dealings. Two of them--the Italians--were arrested and sent to\nthe Bastille where one of them died. By unhappy chance the other was\ngiven as cell-companion Captain Sainte-Croix, who was a lover of the\nMarquise de Brinvilliers. Sainte-Croix as a Captain in the regiment\nof the Marquis had become intimate in his house. Brinvilliers was a\r\nfatuous person and of imperfect moral vision. The Captain was handsome,\nand Madame la Marquise amorous. Behold then all the usual _personnel_\nof a tragedy of three. After a while the intrigue became a matter of\nfamily concern. The lady’s father,--the Civil Lieutenant d’Aulroy,\nprocured a _lettre de cachet_, and had the erring lover immured in the\nBastille as the easiest and least public way out of the difficulty.\n“Evil communications corrupt good manners,” says the proverb. The\r\nproverbial philosopher understated the danger of such juxtaposition.\nEvil manners added corruption even to their kind. In the Bastille the\nexasperated lover listened to the wiles of Exili; and another stage\nof misdoing began. The Marquise determined on revenge, and be sure\nthat in such a case in such a period even the massive walls of the\nBastille could not prevent the secret whisper of a means of effecting\nit. D’Aulroy, his two sons, and another sister perished. Brinvilliers\r\nhimself was spared through some bizarre freak of his wife’s conscience.\nThen the secret began to be whispered--first, it was said, through\nthe confessional; and the _Chambre Ardente_, analogous to the British\nStar Chamber, instituted for such purposes, took the case in hand. The\nresult might have been doubtful, for great social forces were at work\nto hush up such a scandal, but that, with a truly seventeenth century\r\ncandour, the prisoner had written an elaborate confession of her guilt,\nwhich if it did not directly assure condemnation at least put justice\non the right track.\n\nThe trial was a celebrated one, and involved incidentally many\nillustrious persons as well as others of lesser note. In the end, in\n1676, Madame la Marquise de Brinvilliers was burned--that is, what was\nleft of her was burned after her head had been cut off, a matter of","grace in consideration of her rank. It is soothing to the feelings of\nmany relatives and friends--not to mention those of the principal--in\nsuch a case when “great command o’ersways the order” of purgation by\nfire.\n\nBefore the eddy of the Brinvilliers’ criminal scandal reached to the\nlower level of Madame Voisin, a good many scandals were aired; though\nagain “great command” seems to have been operative, so far as human\npower availed, in minimising both scandals and punishments. Amongst\r\nthose cited to the _Chambre Ardente_ were two nieces of Cardinal\nMazarin, the Duchesse de Bouillon, the Comtesse de Soissons, and\nMarshal de Luxembourg. In some of these cases that which in theatrical\nparlance is called “comic relief” was not wanting. It was a witty if\nimpertinent answer of the Duchesse de Bouillon to one of her judges,\nLa Reyne, an ill-favoured man, who asked, apropos of a statement made\nat the trial that she had taken part in an alleged invocation of\r\nBeelzebub, “and did you ever see the Devil?”--\n\n“Yes, I am looking at him now. He is ugly, and is disguised as a\nCouncillor of State!”\n\nThe King, Louis XIV, took much interest in the trial and even tried\nnow and again to smooth matters. He even went so far as to advise\nthe Comtesse de Soissons who was treated by the Court rather as a\nfoolish than a guilty woman, to keep out of the way if she were really\nguilty. In answer she said with the haughtiness of her time that\r\nthough she was innocent she did not care to appear in a Law Court. She\nwithdrew to Brussels where she died some twenty years later. Marshal\nde Luxembourg--François Henri de Montmorenci-Boutteville, duke, peer,\nMarshal of France to give his full titles--was shown to have engaged in\nan attempt to recover lost property by occult means. On which basis\nand for having once asked Madame Voisin to produce his Satanic Majesty,\nhe was alleged to have sold himself to the Devil. But his occult","adventures did not stand in the way of his promotion as a soldier\nthough he had to stand a trial of over a year long; he was made Captain\nof the Guard and finally given command of the Army.\n\nLa Voisin with her accomplices--a woman named Vigoureux and Le Sage,\na priest--were with a couple of score of others arrested in 1679, and\nwere, after a spell of imprisonment in the Bastille, tried. As a result\nVoisin, Vigoureux and her brother, and Le Sage were burned early in\r\n1680. In Voisin’s case the mercy of previous decapitation, which had\nbeen accorded to her guilty sister Brinvilliers, was not extended to\nher. Perhaps this was partly because of the attitude which she had\ntaken up with regard to religious matters. Amongst other unforgivable\nacts she had repelled the Crucifix--a terrible thing to do according to\nthe ideas of that superstitious age.\n\n\n\n\nD. SIR EDWARD KELLEY\n\n\nCarlyle in his _French Revolution_ makes a contrast between two works\r\nof imagination which mark the extremes of the forces that made for\nthe disruption of France, _Paul et Virginie_ and _Le Chevalier de\nFaublas_. The former he calls “the swan-song of old dying France”; of\nthe latter he says “if this wretched _Faublas_ is a death-speech, it\nis one under the gallows, and by a felon that does not repent.” This\ndouble analogy may well serve for a comparison of Dr. Dee and the man\nwho was at once his partner for a time, and his evil genius. The grave\r\nearnest old scholar, with instincts for good, high endeavour, and a\nvast intellectual strength, contrasts well with the mean-souled shifty\nspecious rogue who fastened himself on him and leech-like drained him\n“dry as hay.”\n\nSuch historians as mention the existence of the latter are even a\nlittle doubtful how to spell his name. This, however, does not matter\nmuch--nay, at all, for it is probably not that to which he was born.\r\nBriefly the following is his record as far as can be discovered. He\nwas born in 1555 to parents living in Worcester, who having tried\nto bring him up as an apothecary, sent him to Oxford when he was\nseventeen years of age. There he was entered at Gloucester Hall,\nunder the name of Talbot. As however three men of that name were in\nthe Hall at the same time, it is doubtful what family can claim the\nhonour of his kinship. His college life was short--only lasting a","year--and inconspicuous. “He left,” we are told, “abruptly.” Then, as\nif to complete the purely educational phase of his existence, he was\nfor a while an attorney, eking out the tenuity of his legal practice\nby aid of forgery. Thus full-fledged for his work in life, he made\nhis first properly-recorded appearance in the pillory in 1580, for\nan offence which is variously spoken of as forgery and coining. At\nany rate his ears were cropped off, a loss which necessitated for\r\nprudential reasons his wearing a skullcap for the remainder of his\ndays. This he wore with such conspicuous success that it is said that\neven Doctor Dee, who was his partner for nearly seven years, did not\nknow of his mutilation. Kelley’s next recorded offence was one which\nin a later age when subjects for dissection (necessary for purposes of\neducation in anatomy) were difficult to obtain, was popularly known\nas “body-snatching.” The commission of this offence though a serious\r\nbreach of the law, came to be regarded as a necessary condition of\nstudy; and even if punishment was meted out, it was not looked upon as\ndishonour. But in Kelley’s case the offence was committed not for the\npurpose of scientific education but for one of sorcery. It took place\nin Walton-le-dale in Lancashire, where Kelley dug up a body buried\non the previous day, for purposes of necromancy, which, it will be\nremembered, was, as the etymology of the word implies, divination by\r\nmeans of the dead.\n\nFrom this time on, he seemed to see his way clear to the final choice\nof a profession. He had tasted crime and punishment, and considered\nhimself well qualified to accept the risks as well as the benefits;\nand so chose fraud as his life work. He was still under twenty-five\nyears of age when he began to look about him for his next means\nor occasion of turning his special talents to profit. After some\r\ndeliberation he fixed on the existence and qualities of the famous (as\nhe had then become) Doctor Dee, and carefully commenced operations.\nHe called on the mathematician at his house at Mortlake and made his\nacquaintance. Dee was naturally impressed by the conversation and\nostensible qualities of the young man, who had the plausibility of the\nborn rogue and laid himself out to captivate the old man, more than","double his companion’s age and worn by arduous study. He fostered all\nDee’s natural weaknesses, humoured his fads, was enthusiastic regarding\nhis beliefs which he appeared to share, and urged on his personal\nambitions. The belief in occultism which the philosopher cherished\nin secret, though he had openly and formally repudiated it a dozen\nyears before in his preface to Sir Henry Billingsley’s translation\nof Euclid, gave the parasitic rogue his cue for further ingratiating\r\nhimself, and before long he entered Dee’s service at an annual salary\nof fifty pounds. His special function was that of “skryer,” which\nwas his own or Dee’s reading of “seer.” His contribution to the\ngeneral result was to see the figures which did--or did not--appear\nin the so-called “magic” crystal, an office for which his useful\nimagination, his unblushing assurance, and his utter unscrupulousness\neminently fitted him. In fact he was in his designs of fraud a perfect\r\ncomplement of the simple-minded scientist. Of course as days went on\nand opportunities offered themselves, through Dee’s growing madness\nand Kelley’s social enlargements, the horizon of chicanery widened.\nThis was largely assisted by the opportune arrival in England of the\nPalatine Albert Laski in 1583. Laski was just the man that Kelley was\nwaiting for. A rich man with a taste for occult science; sufficiently\nlearned to keep in touch with the theories of occultism of that time;\r\nsufficiently vain to be used by an unscrupulous adventurer who tickled\nhis intellectual palate whilst he matured his frauds upon him.\n\nKelley having worked on Dee’s feelings sufficiently to secure his\nacquiescence, procured that Laski should be allowed to aid in such\noperations and experiments as appealed to him. The result was that the\nPalatine took the two men with him, promising a free field for them\nboth, each according to his bent. At Prague, in 1583, Laski presented","Dee and his companion to the Emperor Rudolph II. Encouraged by the\nroyal approval, Dee looked for a longer sojourn in eastern Europe, and\nbrought thither his wife and children from Poland, where he had left\nthem at Laskoe, the seat of the Palatine. Later on, in 1585,--again\nthrough the influence of the credulous Laski--Dee with his companion\nwas presented to Stephen, King of Poland. Stephen was much interested,\nand attended a _séance_ that he might see the spirits of which he\r\nhad heard so much. He saw too much, however, as far as Kelley was\nconcerned, for he penetrated the imposture. Thereupon Kelley, unequal\nto carrying on the business single-handed, for he dared not let Dee’s\neyes be opened and he knew he could not induce him to be other than\na blind partner, contrived that a new confederate should be added to\nthe firm. This was one Francis Pucci, a Florentine, possessed of all\nthe address and subtlety of his race. But after the experience of a\r\nyear he was removed on suspicion of bad faith. Before that year was\nout, the Bishop of Piacenza, Apostolic Nuncio at the Emperor’s Court,\nhad a decree issued that the two Englishmen should quit Prague within\nsix days. From Prague they went to Erfurt, in Thuringia; but despite\nletters of recommendation from high quarters the Municipal Authorities\nwould not allow them to remain. So they moved on to Hesse-Cassel and\r\nthence to Tribau in Bohemia, where the fraud of making spirits appear\nwas renewed. In 1586, it was intimated to Dee that the Emperor of\nRussia wished to receive him in that country. He would receive a fee of\ntwo thousand pounds per annum and would be treated with honour; but the\nscholar did not see his way to accept the flattering offer. At Tribau,\nKelley experimented, but unsuccessfully, with some powder found at\nGlastonbury, Dee’s young son being the medium. It was noticeable that\r\nwhenever Dee or his family failed in these experiments, Kelley always\nsucceeded. At this stage Kelley, who was a man of evil life, fell madly\nin love with Dee’s wife. He was married himself, but that did not seem\nto matter. His own wife was ugly and unattractive, whereas the second\nMrs. Dee was well-favoured and winning. In the madness of his lust\nhe tried to work on the husband’s credulity by telling him that it\nhad been conveyed to him through angels that it was the Divine wish","that the two men should hold their wives in common. Dee was naturally\nsceptical and annoyed, and his wife was furious. Kelley, however, was\npersistent, and stuck to his point so stedfastly that after a while\nthe woman’s resolution began to give way, and for a time some sort of\nworking arrangement came about. Kelley’s story, as elaborated to his\npartner, was that at Tribau, in 1587, the crystal showed him a vision\nof a naked woman who conveyed to him the divine message. To Dee’s\r\nunhinged mind this seemed all natural and correct--probably even to\nthe suitable costume adopted by the angelic messenger: so the worthy\ndoctor gave way. After a time however the matron recovered her sanity,\nand the vulture and the pigeon parted. Dee gave up to his late partner\nall the “tools of trade” and “properties” of the fraud, and the two\nnever met again.\n\nKelley went to Prague where he was thrown into prison in 1589. He\r\nremained in durance for four years after which he was released. From\nthence on till 1595, he became a vagabond as well as a rogue, and\nwandered about Germany. He again fell into the hands of Rudolph, to be\nagain imprisoned by him. He was killed whilst making a desperate effort\nto escape.\n\nThere seems to be no record of Edward Kelley--or Talbot--having been\nknighted, no authority save his own wish for the use of the title. It\nmay of course be possible that he was knighted by the Emperor in some\r\nmoment of absurd credulity; but there is no record of it. He had no\nchildren.\n\n\n\n\nE. MOTHER DAMNABLE\n\n\nOwing to a want of accord among historians, the searcher after historic\ntruth in our own day can hardly be quite sure of the identity of the\nworthy lady who passed under the above enchanting title. To later\ngenerations the district of Camden Town--formerly a suburb of London\nbut now a fairly central part of it--is best known through a public\r\nhouse, the _Mother Red-Cap_. But before controversy can cease we are\ncalled on to decide if Mother Red-Cap and Mother Damnable were one\nand the same person. A hundred years ago a writer who had made such\nsubjects his own, came to the conclusion that the soubriquet Mother\nDamnable was synonymous with Mother Black-Cap whom he spoke of as of\nlocal fame. But in the century that has elapsed historical research has\nbeen more scientifically organised and the field from which conclusions","can be drawn has been enlarged as well as explored. The fact is that\na century ago the northern suburb had two well-known public houses,\n_Mother Red-Cap_ and _Mother Black-Cap_. It is possible that both the\nworthy vintners who offered “entertainment for man and beast” meant one\nand the same person, though who that person was remains to be seen.\nThe distinctive colour line of the two hostelries was also possibly\r\ndue to considerations of business rather than of art. _Red-cap_ and\n_Black-cap_ are, as names, drawn from these varying sign-boards; the\nterm _Mother_ held in common is simply a title given without any\npretence of doing honour to the alleged practices of the person whom it\nis intended to designate.\n\nThere were in fact two notorious witches, either of whom might have\nbeen in the mind of either artistic designer. One was of Yorkshire\r\nfame in the time of Henry VII. The other was of very much later date\nand of purely local notoriety. The two publicans who exploited these\nidentities under pictorial garb were open and avowed trade rivals.\nThe earlier established of the two had evidently commissioned a\npainter to create a striking sign-board on a given subject, and the\nartist had fulfilled his task by an alleged portrait of sufficiently\nfearsome import to fix the attention of the passer-by, at the same time\r\nconveying to him some hint of the calling of the archetype on which\nher fame was based. Prosperity in the venture begot rivalry; and the\nowner of the new house of refreshment, wishing to outshine his rival\nin trade whilst at the same time availing himself of the publicity and\nlocal fame already achieved, commissioned another artist to commit\nanother pictorial atrocity under the name of art. So far as the purpose\nof publicity went, the ideas were similar; the only differences\r\nbeing in the colour scheme and the measure of attractiveness of the\nalleged prototype. From the indications thus given one may form some\nopinion--based solely on probability--as to which was the earlier and\nwhich the later artistic creation, for it is by this means--and this\nmeans only--that we may after the lapse of at least a century bring\ntradition to our aid, and guess at the original of Mother Damnable.\n\nOf the two signs it seems probable that the black one is the older.","After all, the main purpose of a sign-board is to catch the eye,\nand unless Titian and all who followed him are wrong, red has an\nattractive value beyond all other hues. The dictum of the great Italian\nis unassailable: “Red catches the eye; yellow holds it; blue gives\ndistance.” A free-souled artist with the choice of the whole palette\nopen to him might choose black since historical accuracy was a matter\nto be valued; but in a question of competition a painter would wisely\r\nchoose red--especially when his rival had confined himself to black.\nSo far as attractiveness is concerned, it must be borne in mind that\nthe object of the painter and his patron was to bring customers to a\nLondon suburban public house in the days of George III. To-day there is\na cult of horrors in Paris which has produced some choice specimens of\ndecorative art, such for instance as the café known as _Le Rat Mort_.\n\nSuch places lure their customers by curiosity and sheer horror; but the\r\npersons lured are from a class dominated by “Gallic effervescence” and\nattracted by anything that is _bizarre_, and not of the class of the\nstolid beer-drinking Briton. But even the most stolid of men is pleased\nby the beauty of a woman; so the sign-painter--who knows his art well,\nand has evolved from the ranks of his calling such a man as Franz\nHals--we may be sure, when he wished to please, took for his model some\ngracious personality.\r\nNow the artist of the lady of dark headgear let his imagination run\nfree and produced a face typical of all the sins of the Decalogue. We\nmay therefore take it on the ground of form as well as that of colour\nthat priority of date is to be given to Mother Black-Cap. There is\ngood ground for belief that this deduction is correct. Naturally the\nowner of the earliest public-house wished to make it as attractive as\npossible; and as Camden Town was a suburb through which the northern\r\ntraffic passed on its way to and from London, it was wise to use\nfor publicity and entertainment names that were familiar to north\ncountry ears. Before the railways were organised the great wheeled\nand horse-traffic between London and the North--especially Yorkshire\nwhich was one of the first Counties to take up manufacturing and had\nalready most of the wool trade--went through Camden Town. So it was\nwise forethought to take as an inn sign a Yorkshire name. The name","of Mother Shipton had been in men’s mouths and ears for about two\nhundred years, and as the times had so changed that the old stigma of\nwitchcraft was not then understood, the association of the name with\nKnaresborough alone remained. And so Mother Shipton of Knaresborough\nwas intended as the prototype of the inn portrait with black headgear\nat Camden Town. In the ordinary course of development and business one\nof the two inns succeeded and lasted better than the other. And as\r\nMother Red-Cap has as a name supplanted Mother Damnable, we may with\nsome understanding discuss who that lady was.\n\nShe was a well-known shrew of Kentish Town, daughter of one Jacob\nBingham, a local brickmaker, who had married the daughter of a Scotch\npedlar manifestly not of any high moral character as shown by her\nlater acts and the general mistrust which attended them. They had\none daughter, Jinny, who in wickedness outdid her parents. She was\r\nnaturally warm-blooded and had a child when she was sixteen by a man of\nno account, George Coulter, known as Gipsy George. Whatever affection\nmay have existed between them was cut short by his arrest--and\nsubsequent execution at Tyburn--for sheepstealing. In her second\nquasi-matrimonial venture Jinny lived a cat-and-dog life with a man\ncalled Darby who spent his time in getting drunk and trying to get\nover it. Number Two’s end was also tragic. After a violent quarrel\r\nwith his companion he disappeared. Then there was domestic calm for a\nwhile, possibly due to the fact that Bingham and his wife were being\ntried also on a charge of witchcraft, complicated with another capital\ncharge of procuring the death of a young woman. They were both hanged\nand thereafter Jinny found time for another episode of love-making and\ntook up with a man called Pitcher. He too disappeared, but his body,\nburned almost to a cinder, was discovered in a neighbouring oven. Jinny\r\nwas tried for murder, but escaped on the plea that the man often took\nrefuge in the oven when he wished to get beyond reach of the woman’s\nvenomous tongue, to which fact witness was borne by certain staunch\ncompanions of Miss Bingham.\n\nJinny’s third venture towards happy companionship, though it lasted\nmuch longer, was attended with endless bitter quarrelling, and came\nto an equally tragic end, had at the beginning a spice of romance.","This individual, whose name has seemingly not been recorded, being\npursued in Commonwealth times for some unknown offence, had sought her\naid in attempting to escape. This she had graciously accorded, with\nthe consequence that they lived together some years in the greatest\nunhappiness.\n\nAt length he died--of poison, but by whom administered did not\ntranspire at the inquest. For the rest of her life Miss Bingham,\r\nwho was now old, lived under the suspicion of being a witch. Her\nostensible occupation was as a teller of fortunes and a healer of\nodd diseases--occupations which singly or together make neither for\npersonal esteem or general confidence. Her public appearances were\nusually attended by hounding and baiting by the rabble; and whenever\nanything went wrong in her neighbourhood the blame was, with overt\nviolence of demeanour, attributed to her. She did not even receive any\r\nof the respect usually shown to a freeholder--which she was, having\nby her father’s death become owner of a house which he had built for\nhimself with his own hands on waste ground. Her only protector was that\nusual favourite of witches, a black cat, whose devotion to her and\nwhose savage nature, accompanied by the public fear shown for an animal\nwhich was deemed her “familiar,” caused the mob to flee before its\nappearance.\n\nThe tragedy and mystery of her life were even exceeded by those of her\r\ndeath. When, having been missed for some time, her house was entered\nshe, attended only by her cat and with her crutch by her side, was\nfound crouching beside the cold ashes of her extinct fire. In the\ntea-pot beside her was some liquid, seemingly brewed from herbs.\nWilling hands administered some of this to the black cat, whose hair,\nwithin a very short time, fell off. The cat forthwith died. Then the\nclamour began. Very many people suddenly remembered having seen,\r\nafter her last appearance in public, the Devil entering her house. No\none, however, had seen him come out again. What a pity it was that no\nveracious scribe or draughtsman was present in the crowd which had\nnoticed the Devil’s entry to the house. In such case we might have got\na real likeness of His Satanic Majesty--a thing which has long been\nwanted--and the opportunities of obtaining which are few.\n\nOne peculiar fact is recorded of Madame Damnable’s burial; her body was","so stiff from the _rigor mortis_--or from some other cause--that the\nundertakers had to break her limbs before they could put her body in\nthe coffin.\n\n\n\n\nF. MATTHEW HOPKINS\n\n\nThere is one thing more evil than oppression in the shape of\nwrong-doing, and that is oppression in the guise of good. Tennyson,\nin one of his poems, speaks of the dishonest pharmacist who “pestles\na poison’d poison.” This is a refinement of iniquity; a poisoned\r\npoison is not even an enlargement of evil but a structural change\neliminating the intention of good and replacing it with evil intent.\nWitches were quite bad enough; or rather they would have been, had that\nwhich was alleged of them been true. But a man who got his living by\ncreating suspicion regarding them and following it out to the practical\nconsummation of a hideous death, was a thousand times worse. To-day\nsuch a functionary as a witch-finder exists, it is true; but only\r\namongst the very lowest and most debased savages. And it is only by the\nrecorded types made known to us that it is possible even to guess at\nthe iniquity of their measures, the vileness of their actions. In the\nfull tally of the two centuries during which the witch mania existed\nin England, it is impossible to parallel the baseness of the one man\nwho distinguished himself in this loathsome occupation. The facts of\nhis history speak for themselves. Matthew Hopkins was born in Suffolk\r\nearly in the seventeenth century. He was the son of a minister, James\nHopkins of Wenham. He was brought up for the law, and when enrolled\nas an attorney, practised in Ipswich; but after a while he moved to\nManningtree where, after he had given up the law, he took to the\ncalling of witch-finder, being the first person in England to follow\nthat honourable trade.\n\nIf he had had no suitable opportunities of earning an honest livelihood\r\nand been graced with no education, some excuse might have been offered\nfor his despicable calling. But when we remember that he passed his\nyouth in a household practising religion, and was a member of a learned\nprofession, it is difficult to find words sufficiently comprehensive\nfor the fit expression of our natural indignation against him. If\npicturesque profanity were allowable, it might be well applied to\nthis despicable wretch and his nefarious labours. In no imaginable","circumstances could there possibly be anything to be said in mitigation\nof his infamy. When we think that the whole ritual of oppression was\nin his own hands--that he began with lying and perjury, and ended with\nmurder; that he showed, throughout, ruthless callousness for the mental\nand physical torture of great numbers of the most helpless class of\nthe community, the poor, the weak, the suffering, the helpless and\r\nhopeless; that when once his foul imagination had consecrated any poor\nwretch to destruction, or his baleful glance had unhappily lighted\non some unsuspecting victim there was for such only the refuge of\ndeath, and that by some means of prolonged torture, we cannot find\nany hope or prospect even in evil dreams of the nether world, of any\nadequate punishment for his dreadful sins. When we remember that this\none man--if man he can be called--was in himself responsible for what\r\namounted to the murder of some two hundred women whom he pursued to the\ndeath, the magnitude of his guilt can be guessed but not realised.\n\nHe occupied three whole years in his fell work; and in those years,\n1644, 1645 and 1646, he caused a regular reign of terror throughout\nthe counties of Huntingdon, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. He had a gang\nof his own to help him in his gruesome work of “discovering” witches;\namongst whom was a wretch called John Stern and--to her shame--a woman,\r\nwhose name is unrecorded. These three had a sort of mock assize of\ntheir own. They made regular tours of discovery, at a charge of twenty\nshillings for expenses at each place they visited. There appears to\nhave been a fee paid or exacted for each witch “bagged”; and such was\nhis greed that after a while he actually lowered the price. In 1645,\nwhich was perhaps his “best” year, the price declined to a shilling\na head. Hopkins and his gang took comfort, however, from the fact\r\nthat the industry was a growing one. The trade had only been initiated\nin 1644, and already in a year’s time he had in one day procured\nthe execution of eighteen alleged witches; and at the end of that\nassize, after the gaol delivery had been effected, one hundred and\ntwenty suspects still awaited trial. In the skilful hands of Matthew\nHopkins, trial was only a step on the road to certain execution by one\nof the forms in use. Here came in, not only the witchfinder’s legal","knowledge, but also his gift of invention--the latter being used in the\nformulation of so-called “tests” which were bound to be effective. Of\nthese the simplest was the water test. The subject’s thumbs were tied\ntogether and she was then thrown into water of sufficient depth. If she\ndid not drown, it was taken as a proof of guilt; and she was hanged\nby form of law. In some cases, as an alternative, she was burned. If\nshe did not stand the test her friends had the pleasure of knowing\r\nthat she was pronounced to have died innocent. In any case there was\nno further trouble with her. Such was the accuracy as well as the\nsimplicity of similar “tests” that, in the twenty years previous to the\nRestoration, between three and four thousand alleged witches perished\nin England from one cause or another. Hopkins professed to be both\njust and merciful. He seemed generally willing to afford a “test” to\nthe accused; though, truth to tell, the result was always the same.\r\nIn such cases the test was eminently calculated to evoke confession,\nand such confession, no matter how ridiculous or extravagant it\nmight be, was simply a curved road to the rope or the torch instead\nof a straight one. One of these pleasing “tests” was to place the\nold woman--they were all women and all old--sitting cross-legged on\na stool or table where she could be well watched. She was generally\nkept in that position under inspection, without food or water, for\r\ntwenty-four hours. At the end of that time such resolution as had\nremained disappeared, and in the vain blind hope of some change for the\nbetter, some alleviation however slight of the grinding misery, of the\nagony of body and mind and soul, they confessed. And such confessions!\nThe very consideration of such of them as now remain in the cold\nthird-person method of a mere recorder, almost makes one weep; there\nis hardly a word that is not almost a certificate of character. With\r\nevery desire to confess--for such was the last hope of pleasing their\ntorturers--their utter ignorance of confessional matter is almost a\nproof of innocence.\n\nJust imagine the scene--a village or hamlet, or the poorer quarter\nof a small country town with squalid surroundings, marking a poverty\nwhich in this age has no equal; a poor, old, lonely woman whose long\nlife of sordid misery, of hunger and the diseases that huddle closely","around want, hopeless, despairing, recognising her fate through the\nprolonged physical torture with which age and infirmity rendered her\nunable even to attempt to cope. Round her gathered, in a sickly ring,\na crowd of creatures debased by the exercise of greed and cruelty to a\nlower level than the beasts. Their object is not to inquire, to test,\nto judge; but only to condemn, to wreck, to break, to shatter. Some\nof them, she realises even in her agony, are spurred on by the same\r\nzeal which animated the cruelty of followers of Ignatius in the grim\ntorture-chambers of the Inquisition.\n\nThe poor dazed, suffering old creature, racked with pains prolonged\nbeyond endurance, tries to rally such glimmerings of invention as\nare possible to her untaught, unfed mind; but finds herself at every\nfailure fluttering helplessly against a wall of spiritual granite which\ngives back not even an echo to her despairing cry. At last she comes\r\nto that stage where even fright and fear have no standing room, and\nwhere the blank misery of suffering ceases to be effective. Then the\nlast flicker of desire for truth or rectitude of purpose dies away, and\nshe receives in feeble acquiescence such suggestions as are shouted\nor whispered to her, in the hope that by accepting them she may win a\nmoment’s ease of body or mind, even if it be her last on earth. Driven\r\nbeyond mortal limits her untutored mind gives way; and with the last\nremnants of her strength she yields her very soul to her persecutors.\nThe end does not matter to her now. Life has no more to offer her--even\nof pain, which is the last conscious tie to existence. And through\nit all, ghoul-like, watching and waiting for the collapse, whilst\noutwardly he goes through the mechanical ritual of prayer, we see in\nthe background the sinister figure of the attorney, preparing in his\r\nmind such evidence as he may procure or invent for his work of the next\nday.\n\nIt needs the imagination of a Dante to consider what should be the\nplace of such an one in history, and any eternity of punishment that\nthat imagination could suggest must be inadequate. Even pity itself\nwhich rests on sympathy and is kin to the eternal spirit of justice,\nwould have imagined with satisfaction the wretched soul going through a\nbaleful eternity clinging in perpetual agony of fear to the very King","of Terrors.\n\nIn judging Matthew Hopkins one must not, in justice to others, accord\nhim any of the consideration which is the due of good intent. Not a\nscore of years after his shameful death, a man was born in a newer land\nfar beyond the separating sea, who through his influence, his teaching,\nthe expression of his honest conviction, was the cause of perhaps more\ndeaths than the English anti-witch. We refer to Cotton Mather, who\r\nbelieved he wrought for the Lord--in his own way--in New England. But\nguilt does not attach to him. He was an earnest, though mistaken man,\nand the results of his mistaken teaching were at variance with the\ntrend of his kindly, godly life.\n\nIt must be pleasing to the spirit of the Old Adam which is in us\nall in some form, to think of the manner of the death of Matthew\nHopkins. Three years had exhausted not only the material available\r\nfor his chosen work, but, what was worse for him, the patience of the\ncommunity. Moreover, he had given cause for scandal in even his own\ndegraded trade and in himself, the filthiest thing in connection with\nit. Not content with dealing with the poor, helpless folk, whom he\nhad come to regard as his natural prey, he went on fancy flights of\noppression. At last he went too far. He ventured to denounce an aged\nclergyman of blameless life. The witch-fever was too strong for justice\r\nin any form, and neither age, high character, nor sacred office could\nprotect this gentleman of eighty years of age. He too was tortured,\ntill in a moment of unhinged mind, he confessed as he was ordered,\nand was duly hanged. This was in 1645. The old man’s death was not in\nvain, for it was made the occasion of much necessary plain speaking.\nPresently the public conscience was wakened; chiefly by another cleric,\nthe Rev. John Caule, vicar of Great Staughton, Huntingdonshire--all\r\nhonour to him!--who, though strange to say he believed in witchcraft,\nrealised the greater evil wrought by men like Hopkins. He published\na pamphlet in which he denounced Hopkins as a common nuisance. The\nresult, if slow, was sure. The witch-finder never recovered from the\nshock of Caule’s vigorous attack. In 1647, on information based on\nHopkins’ own rules, he was arrested and subjected to the test which\nhe had devised: he was tied by the thumbs and thrown into the water.","Unfortunately for himself he withstood the test--drowning, except for a\nshort period of pangs, is an easy death--and so was by process of Law\nduly hanged.\n\nOne can imagine how the whole atmosphere of the country--surcharged\nwith suspicion, fear, oppression, torture, perjury or crime--was\ncleared by the execration which followed the removal of this vile\nwretch.\n\n\n\n\nVI. ARTHUR ORTON\n\n(The Tichborne Claimant.)\n\n\nIn the annals of crime, Arthur Orton, the notorious claimant to the\r\nrich estates and title of Tichborne, takes a foremost place; not only\nas the originator of one of the most colossal attempts at fraud on\nrecord, but also from his remarkable success in duping the public. It\nwould be difficult indeed to furnish a more striking example of the\nheight to which the blind credulity of people will occasionally attain.\nOf pretenders, who by pertinacious and unscrupulous lying have sought\r\nto bolster up fictitious claims, there have been many before Orton;\nbut he certainly surpassed all his predecessors in working out the\nlie circumstantial in such a way as to divide the country for years\ninto two great parties--those who believed in the Claimant, and those\nwho did not. Over one hundred persons, drawn from every class, and\nfor the most part honest in their belief, swore to the identity of\nthis illiterate butcher’s son--this stockman, mail-rider and probably\r\nbushranger and thief--as the long-lost son and heir of the ancient\nhouse of Tichborne of Titchborne. To gain his own selfish ends this\nindividual was ready to rob a gentlewoman of her fair fame, to destroy\nthe peace of a great family who, to free themselves from a persecution,\nas cruel as it was vicious, had to be pilloried before a ruthless and\nunsympathising mob, to have the privacy of their home invaded, and\nto hear their women’s names banded from one coarse mouth to another.\r\nThus, and through no fault of their own, they were compelled to endure\na mental torture far worse than any physical suffering, besides having\nto expend vast sums of money, as well as time and labour, in order to\nprotect themselves from the would-be depredations of an unscrupulous\nadventurer. It has been estimated that the resistance of this\nfictitious claim cost the Tichborne estate not far short of one hundred\nthousand pounds.\n\n[Illustration:","_Photo. by Maull & Fox. Copyright._\n\nARTHUR ORTON]\n\nThe baronetcy of Tichborne, now Doughty-Tichborne, is one of the\noldest. It has been claimed that the family held possession of the\nManor of Tichborne for two hundred years before the Conquest. Be\nthis as it may--and, in the light of J. H. Round’s revelations, some\nscepticism as to these pre-Norman pedigrees is permissible--their\nancestors may be traced back to one Walter de Tichborne who held the\r\nmanor, from which he took his name, as early as 1135. Their names too,\nare interwoven with the history of the country. Sir Benjamin, the first\nbaronet--for the earlier de Tichbornes were knights,--as Sheriff of\nSouthhampton, on the death of Queen Elizabeth, repaired instantly\nto Winchester and on his own initiative proclaimed the accession of\nJames VI of Scotland as King of England, for which service he was made\na baronet, and his four sons received the honour of knighthood. His\r\nsuccessor, Sir Richard, was a zealous supporter of the Royal cause\nduring the civil wars. Sir Henry, the third baronet, hazarded his life\nin the defence of Charles I and had his estates sequestered by the\nParliamentarians though he was recompensed at the Restoration.\n\nBelievers in occultism might see in the trials and tribulations\nbrought down upon the unfortunate heads of the Tichborne family by the\nmachinations of the Claimant, the realisation of the doom pronounced by\r\na certain Dame Ticheborne away back in the days of Henry II.\n\nSir Roger de Ticheborne of those days married Mabell, the daughter and\nheiress of Ralph de Lamerston, of Lamerston, in the Isle of Wight, by\nwhom he acquired that estate. This good wife played the part of lady\nbountiful of the neighbourhood. After a life spent in acts of charity\nand goodness, as her end drew nigh and she lay on her death bed, her\r\nthoughts went out to her beloved poor. She begged her husband, that in\norder to have her memory kept green the countryside round, he would\ngrant a bequest sufficient to ensure, once a year, a dole of bread to\nall comers to the gates of Tichborne. To gratify her whim Sir Roger\npromised her as much land as she could encompass while a brand plucked\nfrom the fire should continue to burn. As the poor lady had been\nbedridden for years her husband may have had no idea that she could,","even if she would, take his promise seriously. However, the venerable\ndame, after being carried out upon the ground, seemed to regain her\nstrength in a miraculous fashion, and, to the surprise of all, managed\nto crawl round several rich and goodly acres which to this day are\nknown as “the Crawls.”\n\nCarried to her bed again after making this last supreme effort and\nsummoning her family to her bedside, Lady Ticheborne predicted with her\ndying breath, that, as long as this annual dole was continued, so long\r\nshould the house of Tichborne prosper; but, should it be neglected,\ntheir fortunes would fail and the family name become extinct from want\nof male issue. As a sure sign by which these disasters might be looked\nfor, she foretold that a generation of seven sons would be immediately\nfollowed by one of seven daughters.\n\nThe benevolent custom thus established was faithfully observed for\ncenturies. On every Lady Day crowds of humble folk came from near\r\nand far to partake of the famous dole which consisted of hundreds of\nsmall loaves. But ultimately the occasion degenerated into a noisy\nmerry-making, a sort of fair, until it was finally discontinued in\n1796, owing to the complaints of the magistrates and local gentry that\nthe practice encouraged vagabonds, gipsies and idlers of all sorts to\nswarm into the neighbourhood under pretence of receiving the dole.\r\nStrangely enough Sir Henry Tichborne, the baronet of that day (the\noriginal name of de Ticheborne had by this time been reduced to\nTichborne), had seven sons, while his eldest son who succeeded him in\n1821, had seven daughters. The extinction of the family name, too,\ncame to pass, for in the absence of male issue, Sir Henry, the eighth\nbaronet, was succeeded by his brother, who had taken the surname of\nDoughty on coming into the estates bequeathed to him on these terms, by\r\na distant relative, Miss Doughty; though, in after years, his brother,\nwho in turn succeeded him, obtained the royal licence to couple the\nold family name with that of Doughty. Following this repeated lapse of\ndirect male heirs came other troubles; but it is to be hoped that the\nsuccessful defeat of the fraudulent claim of Arthur Orton set a period\nto the doom pronounced long years ago by the Lady Mabell.\n\nMost families, great and small, have their secret troubles and","unpleasantness, and the Tichbornes seem to have had their share of\nthem. To this may be traced the actual, if remote, cause of the\nClaimant’s imposture. James Tichborne, afterwards the tenth baronet,\nthe father of the missing Roger, who was drowned in the mysterious\nloss of the _Bella_, off the coast of South America, in the spring of\n1854, lived abroad for many years; but, while his wife was French in\nevery sentiment, he himself from time to time exhibited a keen desire\r\nto return to his native land. When Roger was born there was small\nlikelihood of his ever succeeding to either title or estates, and so\nhis education was almost entirely a foreign one.\n\nSir Henry Tichborne, who had succeeded in 1821, though blessed with\nseven beautiful daughters, had no son. Still there was their uncle\nEdward, who had taken the name of Doughty, and he, after Sir Henry,\nwas the next heir. Edward, too, had a son and daughter. But, one day,\r\nnews came to James and his wife, in France, that their little nephew\nwas dead; and with the possibilities which this change opened up, it\nbrought home to the father the error he had committed in permitting\nRoger to grow up ignorant of the English tongue and habits. It was\nmanifest that Mr. James F. Tichborne was not unlikely to become the\nnext baronet, and he felt it his bounden duty to make good his previous\nneglect, by providing his son with an English education, such as would\r\nfit him for his probable position as head of the house of Tichborne.\nIn this praiseworthy intention he met with strong opposition from his\nwife whose great aim it was to see her son grow up a Frenchman. To her,\nFrance was the only land worth living in. She cared nought for family\ntraditions; her dream was that her darling boy should marry into some\ndistinguished family in France or Italy. If he was to enter the army,\nthen it should be in some foreign service. But to England he should\r\nnot go if she could prevent it.\n\nJames Tichborne, like many weak men with self-willed wives, put off\nthe inevitable day as long as he could; and in the end only achieved\nhis purpose by strategy. Roger was sixteen years of age when news\narrived of the death of Sir Henry. Naturally James arranged to be\npresent at his brother’s funeral and it was only reasonable that he\nshould be accompanied by his son Roger, whom everyone now regarded as","the heir. Accordingly the boy took leave of his mother, but under the\nsolemn injunction to return quickly. However, his father had determined\notherwise. After attending the funeral of his uncle, at the old chapel\nat Tichborne, Roger was, by the advice of relatives and friends, and\nwith the consent of the boy himself, taken down to the Jesuit College\nat Stonyhurst. When Mrs. Tichborne learned of this step, her fury knew\nno bounds. She upbraided her husband violently; and there was a renewal\r\nof the old scenes in the Tichborne establishment. Roger wrote his\nmother filial, if ill-spelt, letters in French; but, for a year, the\nson, though ardently looking for a letter, got no token of affection\nfrom the incensed and indignant lady.\n\nDuring his three years’ stay at Stonyhurst, Roger seems to have applied\nhimself diligently to the study of English; but, though he made fair\nprogress, he was never able to speak it with as much purity and\r\ncommand of words as when conversing in French. In Latin, mathematics,\nand chemistry, too, he contrived to make fair headway; while his\nletters evidenced an inclination for the study of polite literature.\nIf not highly accomplished, he was of a refined and sensitive nature.\nDuring this period he made many friends, spending his vacation with his\nEnglish relatives in turn. His great delight was to stay at Tichborne,\r\nthen in possession of his father’s brother, Sir Edward Doughty. Withal,\nthe shy, pale-faced boy steadily gained in favour, for he had a nature\nwhich disarmed ill-feeling. As time wore on it became necessary to\ndetermine on some profession for the lad; and needless to say his\nfather’s choice of the army added fuel to the fire of his wife’s anger.\nAfter some delay a commission was obtained and Mr. Roger Charles\nTichborne was gazetted a coronet in the Sixth Dragoons, better known as\r\nthe Carbineers.\n\nDefeated in her purpose of making a Frenchman of her boy, Roger’s\nmother yet continued to harp upon her old desire to marry him to one\nof the Italian princesses of whom he had heard so much. But Roger\nhad other ideas, for he had fallen passionately in love with his\ncousin--Miss Katharine Doughty afterwards Lady Radcliffe. However, the\ncourse of love was not to run smooth. The Tichbornes had always been\nRoman Catholic, and the marriage of first cousins was discountenanced","by that church. Consequently when some little token incidentally\nrevealed to the father the secret and yet unspoken love of the young\npeople, their dream was rudely shattered.\n\nThat the girl warmly reciprocated her cousin’s affection was beyond\nquestion, and Lady Doughty was certainly sympathetic though she took\nexception to certain of her nephew’s habits. He was an inveterate\nsmoker besides drinking too freely. These and other little failings\r\nseem to have aroused some fear in her anxious mother’s heart, though\nshe quite recognised the boy’s kind disposition, and the fact that he\nwas truthful, honourable and scrupulous in points of duty. Still she\nwould not oppose the wishes of the young lovers--except to the extent\nof pleading and encouraging Roger to master his weaknesses. It was\nChristmas time in 1851 when the _dénoument_ came and the eyes of Sir\r\nEdward were opened to what was going on. He was both vexed and angry,\nand was resolved that the engagement should be broken off before it\ngrew more serious. One last interview was permitted to the cousins\nand, this over, the young man was to leave the house forever. The\ngreat hope of his life extinguished, there was nothing left for Roger\nbut to rejoin his regiment, then expecting orders for India, and to\nendeavour to forget the past. Still even in those dark days neither\r\nRoger nor Kate quite gave up hope of some change. Lady Doughty, despite\nher dread of her nephew’s habits, had a warm regard for him, and could\nbe relied upon to plead his cause; and in a short time circumstances\nunexpectedly favoured him. Sir Edward was ill and, fearing that death\nwas approaching, he sent for his nephew and revived the subject. He\nexplained that if it were not for the close relationship he should\nhave no objection to the marriage and begged Roger to wait for three\r\nyears. If then the affection, one for the other, remained unaltered,\nand providing that Roger obtained his own father’s consent and that\nof the Church, he would accept things as the will of God and agree to\nthe union. As might be expected, Roger gratefully promised loyally to\nobserve the sick man’s wishes.\n\nHowever, Sir Edward, instead of dying, slowly mended, and Roger\nreturned to his regiment. Occasionally he would spend his leave with","his aunt and uncle, when the young people loved to walk together in the\nbeautiful gardens of Tichborne exchanging sweet confidences and weaving\nplans for the future. On what proved to be his last visit to his\nancestral home, in the midsummer of 1852, Roger, to comfort his cousin,\nconfided a secret to her--a copy of a vow, which he had written out and\nsigned, solemnly pledging himself, in the event of their being married\nbefore three years had passed, to build a church or chapel at Tichborne\r\nas a thanks offering to the Holy Virgin for the protection shown by her\nin praying God that their wishes might be fulfilled.\n\nHis leave up, Roger went back to his regiment more than ever a prey\nto his habitual melancholy. To his great regret the orders for the\nCarbineers to go to India were countermanded. He accordingly determined\nto throw up his commission and travel abroad until his period of\nprobation had passed. South America had long been the subject of his\r\ndreams, and so thither he would make his way; and in travelling through\nthat vast continent he hoped to find occupation for his mind and so get\nthrough the trying period of waiting. His plan was to spend a year in\nChili, Guayaquil and Peru, and thence to visit Mexico, and so, by way\nof the United States, to return home. Having come to this resolution\nhe lost no time in putting it into execution. Being of business-like\r\nhabits he made his will, in which he purposely omitted any mention\nof the “church or chapel.” This secret had already been committed to\npaper, and with other precious souvenirs of his love for his cousin,\nhad been confided to his most trusted friend--Mr. Gosford, the steward\nof the family estate. After paying a round of farewell visits to his\nparents and old friends in Paris, Roger finally set sail from Havre, on\nMarch 21, 1853, in a French vessel named _La Pauline_, for Valparaiso,\r\nat which port she arrived on the 19th of the following June, when Roger\nset out on his wanderings. During his travels Roger continued to write\nhome regularly; but the first news he received was bad. Sir Edward\nDoughty had died almost before the _Pauline_ had lost sight of the\nEnglish shores; and Roger’s father and mother were now Sir James and\nLady Tichborne.\n\nPresently the wanderer began to retrace his steps, making his way to\nRio de Janeiro. Here, he found a vessel called the _Bella_ hailing from","Liverpool, about to sail for Kingston, Jamaica, and as he had directed\nhis letters and remittances to be forwarded there, he prevailed upon\nthe captain to give him a passage. On the 20th of April, 1854, the\n_Bella_ passed from the port of Rio into the ocean. From that day no\none ever set eyes upon her. Six days after she left harbour, a ship\ntraversing her path found, amongst other ominous tokens of a wreck, a\ncapsized long-boat bearing the name “_Bella_, Liverpool.”\r\nThese were taken into Rio and forthwith the authorities caused the\nneighbouring seas to be scoured in quest of survivors; but none were\never found. That the _Bella_ had foundered there was little room to\ndoubt. It was supposed that she had been caught in a sudden squall,\nthat her cargo had shifted, and that, unable to right herself, the\nvessel had gone down in deep water, giving but little warning to those\non board. In a few months the sad news reached Tichborne, where the\r\nabsence of letters from the previously diligent correspondent had\nalready raised grave fears. The sorrow-stricken father caused enquiries\nto be made in America and elsewhere. For a time, there was a faint hope\nthat some one aboard the _Bella_ might have been picked up by some\npassing vessel; but, as months wore on, even these small hopes dwindled\naway. The letters which poor Roger had so anxiously asked might be\ndirected to him at the post office, Kingston, Jamaica, remained there\r\ntill the ink grew faded; the banker’s bill which lay at the agents’\nremained unclaimed. At last the unfortunate vessel was finally written\noff at Lloyd’s as lost, the insurance money paid, and gradually the\n_Bella_ faded from the memories of all but those who had lost friends\nor relatives in her. Lady Tichborne alone, refused to abandon hope.\n\nHer obstinate disregard of such conclusive evidence of the fate of her\r\nunfortunate son preyed upon her mind to such an extent as to make her\nan easy victim for any scheming rascal pretending to have news of her\nlost son; and “sailors,” who told all sorts of wild stories of how\nsome of the survivors of the _Bella_ had been rescued and landed in a\nforeign port, became constant visitors at Tichborne Park and profited\nhandsomely from the weak-minded lady’s credulity. Sir James, himself,\nmade short work of these tramping “sailors,” but after his death,","in 1862, the lady became even more ready to be victimised by their\nspecious lies.\n\nFirm in her belief that Roger was still alive, Lady Tichborne now\ncaused advertisements to be inserted in numerous papers; and in\nNovember, 1865, she learnt through an agency in Sydney that a man\nanswering the description of her son had been found in Wagga Wagga,\nNew South Wales. A long correspondence ensued, the tone and character\r\nof which ought to have put her on her guard; but, over-anxious to\nbelieve that she had indeed found her long-lost son, any wavering\ndoubts she may have had, were swept from her mind by the evidence of\nan aged negro servant named Boyle, an old pensioner of the Tichborne\nfamily. Boyle, who lived in New South Wales, professed to recognise the\nClaimant as his dear young master, and he certainly remained one of his\nmost devoted adherents to the end. Undoubtedly this man’s simplicity\r\nproved a very valuable asset to Orton. His intimate knowledge of the\narrangements of Tichborne Park was pumped dry by his new master, who,\naided by a most tenacious memory, was afterwards able to use the\ninformation thus obtained with startling effect.\n\nAs to the identity of the Claimant with Arthur Orton there can be\nabsolutely no doubt. As a result of the enquiries made by the trustees\nof the Tichborne estate nearly the whole of his history was unmasked.\r\nHe was born, in 1834, at Wapping where his father kept a butcher’s\nshop. In 1848 he took passage to Valparaiso, whence he made his way up\ncountry to Melipilla. Here he stayed some eighteen months receiving\nmuch kindness from a family named Castro, and it was their name he\nwent under at Wagga Wagga. In 1851 he returned home and entering his\nfather’s business became an expert slaughterman. The following year\nhe emigrated to Australia; but after the spring of 1854 he ceased to\r\ncorrespond with his family. He had evidently led a life of hardship\nand adventure--probably not unattended with crime, and certainly with\npoverty. At Wagga Wagga he carried on a small butcher’s business, and\nit was from here that he got into communication with Lady Tichborne\njust after his marriage to an illiterate servant girl.\n\nAccording to his subsequent confession, until his attention was drawn\nto the advertisement for the missing Roger, he had never even heard of","the name of Tichborne, and it was only his success when, by way of a\njoke upon a chum, he claimed to be the missing baronet, that led him\nto pursue the matter in sober earnest. Indeed he seemed at first very\nreluctant to leave Australia, and probably he was only driven to accede\nto Lady Tichborne’s request, to return “home” at once, by the fact that\nhe had raised large sums of money on his expectations. His original\r\nintention was probably to obtain some sort of recognition, and then to\nreturn to Australia with whatever money he had succeeded in collecting.\n\nAfter wasting much time he left Australia and arrived in England, by\na very circuitous route, on Christmas Day, 1866. His first step on\nlanding, it was subsequently discovered, was to make a mysterious\nvisit to Wapping. His parents were dead, but his enquiries showed\na knowledge, both of the Orton family and the locality, which was\r\nafterwards used against him with very damaging effect. His next\nproceeding was to make a flying and surreptitious excursion to\nTichborne House, where, as far as possible, he acquainted himself with\nthe bearings of the place. In this he was greatly assisted by one Rous,\na former clerk to the old Tichborne attorney, who was then keeping a\npublic house in the place. From this man, who became his staunch ally,\nhe had no doubt acquired much useful information; and it is significant\r\nthat he sedulously kept clear of Mr. Gosford, the agent to whom the\nreal Roger had confided his sealed packet before leaving England.\n\nLady Tichborne was living in Paris at this time and it was here, in his\nhotel bedroom, on a dark January afternoon, that their first interview\ntook place for, curiously enough, the gentleman was too ill to leave\nhis bed! The deluded woman professed to recognise him at once. As\nshe sat beside his bed, “Roger” keeping his face turned to the wall,\r\nthe conversation took a wide range, the sick man showing himself\nstrangely astray. He talked to her of his grandfather, whom the real\nRoger had never seen; he said he had served in the ranks; referred to\nStonyhurst as Winchester; spoke of his suffering as a lad from St.\nVitus’s dance--a complaint which first led to young Arthur Orton being\nsent on a sea voyage; but did not speak of the rheumatism from which\nRoger had suffered. But it was all one to the infatuated woman--“He","confuses everything as if in a dream,” she wrote in exculpating him;\nbut unsatisfactory as this identification was, she never departed from\nher belief. She lived under the same roof with him for weeks, accepted\nhis wife and children, and allowed him £1,000 a year. It did not weigh\nwith her that the rest of the family unanimously declared him to be an\nimpostor, or that he failed to recognise them or to recall any incident\nin Roger’s life.\r\nNearly four years elapsed before the Claimant commenced his suit of\nejectment against the trustees of the infant Sir Alfred Tichborne--the\nposthumous son of Roger’s younger brother; but he utilised the time\nto good purpose. He had taken into his service a couple of old\nCarbineers who had been Roger’s servants and before long so completely\nmastered small details of regimental life that some thirty of Roger’s\nold brother-officers and men were convinced of his identity. He\r\nwent everywhere, called upon all Roger’s old friends, visited the\nCarbineers’ mess and generally left no stone unturned to get together\nevidence in support of his identity. As a result of his strenuous\nactivity and plausibility he produced at the first trial over one\nhundred witnesses who, on oath, identified him as Roger Tichborne;\nand these witnesses included Lady Tichborne, the family solicitor,\nmagistrates, officers and men from Roger’s old regiment besides various\r\nTichborne tenants and friends of the family. On the other hand, there\nwere only seventeen witnesses arraigned against him; and, in his own\nopinion, it was his own evidence that lost him the case. He would have\nwon, he said, “if only he could have kept his mouth shut.”\n\nThe trial of this action lasted 102 days. Sergeant Ballantine led for\nthe Claimant; and Sir John Coleridge (afterwards Lord Chief-justice),\nand Mr. Hawkins, Q. C. (afterwards Lord Brampton), for the trustees\r\nof the estates of Tichborne. The cross-examination of the Claimant at\nthe hands of Sir John Coleridge lasted twenty-two days, during which\nthe colossal ignorance he displayed was only equalled by his boldness,\ndexterity and the bull-dog tenacity with which he faced the ordeal.\nTo quote Sir John’s own words: “The first sixteen years of his life\nhe has absolutely forgotten; the few facts he had told the jury were","already proved, or would hereafter be shown, to be absolutely false and\nfabricated. Of his college life he could recollect nothing. About his\namusements, his books, his music, his games, he could tell nothing.\nNot a word of his family, of the people with whom he lived, their\nhabits, their persons, their very names. He had forgotten his mother’s\nmaiden name; he was ignorant of all particulars of the family estate;\nhe remembered nothing of Stonyhurst; and in military matters he was\r\nequally deficient. Roger, born and educated in France, spoke and wrote\nFrench like a native and his favourite reading was French literature;\nbut the Claimant knew nothing of French. Of the ‘sealed’ packet he\nknew nothing and, when pressed, his interpretation of its contents\ncontained the foulest and blackest calumny of the cousin whom Roger had\nso fondly loved. This was proved by Mr. Gosford, to whom the packet had\nbeen originally entrusted, and by the production of the duplicate which\r\nRoger had given to Miss Doughty herself. The physical discrepancy, too,\nwas no less remarkable; for, while Roger, who took after his mother was\nslight and delicate, with narrow sloping shoulders, a long narrow face\nand thin straight dark hair, the Claimant was of enormous bulk, scaling\nover twenty-four stone, big-framed and burly, with a large round face\nand an abundance of fair and rather wavy hair. And yet, curiously\r\nenough, the Claimant undoubtedly possessed a strong likeness to several\nmale members of the Tichborne family.”\n\nWhen questioned as to the impressive episode of Roger’s love for his\ncousin, the Claimant showed himself hopelessly at sea. His answers\nwere confused and irreconcilable. Not only could he give no precise\ndates, but even the broad outline of the story was beyond him. Yet,\nfor good reasons, the Solicitor-General persisted in pressing him as\r\nto the contents of the sealed packet and compelled him to repeat the\nslanderous version of the incident which he had long ago given when\ninterrogated on the point. Mrs. Radcliffe (she was not then Lady) sat\nin court beside her husband, and thus had the satisfaction of seeing\nthe infamous charges brought against the fair fame of her girlhood\nrecoil on the head of the wretch who had resorted to such villainous\ndevices. Unfortunately, some years after Roger’s disappearance, Mr.","Gosford, feeling that he was neither justified in keeping the precious\npacket, nor in handing it to any other person, had burnt it; but,\nfortunately his testimony as to its contents was proved in the most\ncomplete manner by the production of the duplicate which poor Roger had\ngiven to his cousin on his last visit to Tichborne.\n\nWhere the case broke down most completely was in the matter of tattoo\nmarks. Roger had been freely tattooed. Among other marks he bore, on\r\nhis left arm, a cross, an anchor, and a heart which was testified to\nby the persons who had pricked them in. Orton, too, it was found out,\nhad also been tattooed on his left arm with his initials, “A. O.,”\nand, though neither remained, there was a mark which was sworn to be\nthe obliteration of those letters. Small wonder then that, on the top\nof this damning piece of evidence, the jury declared they required to\nhear nothing further, upon which the Claimant’s counsel, to avoid the\r\ninevitable verdict for their opponents, elected to be nonsuited. But\nthese tactics did not save their client, for he was at once arrested,\non the judge’s warrant, on the charge of wilful and corrupt perjury,\nand committed to Newgate where he remained until bail for £10,000 was\nforthcoming.\n\nA year later, on April 23, 1873, the Claimant was arraigned before\na special jury in the Court of Queen’s Bench. The proceedings were\r\nof a most prolix and unusual character. Practically the same ground\nwas covered as in the civil trial, only the process was reversed:\nthe Claimant having now to defend instead of to attack. Many of\nthe better-class witnesses, including the majority of Roger’s\nbrother-officers, now forsook the Claimant. There was a deal of\ncross-swearing. The climax of the long trial was the production by the\ndefence of a witness to support the Claimant’s account of his wreck\r\nand rescue. This was a man who called himself Jean Luie and claimed\nto be a Danish seaman. With a wealth of picturesque detail he told\nhow he was one of the crew of the _Osprey_ which had picked up a boat\nof the shipwrecked _Bella_, in which was the claimant and some of the\ncrew, and how when the _Osprey_ arrived at Melbourne, in the height\nof the gold fever, every man of the crew from the captain downwards\nhad deserted the ship and gone up country. According to his story from","that time forth he had seen nothing of any of the castaways; but having\ncome to England in search of his wife he had heard of the trial. When\nLuie was first brought into the presence of the Claimant that astute\nperson immediately claimed him with the greeting in Spanish “_Como\nesta, Luie?_”--“How are you, Luie?” The sailor with equal readiness\nrecognised Orton as the man he had helped to rescue years before. All\r\nthis sounded very convincing; but it would not stand investigation.\nFrom the beginning to end the thing was an invention; an examination\nof shipping records failed to find the _Osprey_ so that she must have\nescaped the notice of the authorities in every port she had entered\nfrom the day she was launched! Of “Sailor” Luie, however, a very\ncomplete record was established. Not only were the police able to prove\nthat, at the time he swore he was a seaman on board the _Osprey_,\r\nhe was actually employed by a firm at Hull; that he had never been\na seaman at all; but that he was a well-known habitual criminal and\nconvict only recently released on a ticket-of-leave. This made things\nvery awkward for the defence who made every effort to shake free from\nthe taint of such perjured evidence. Dr. Kenealy, seeing his dilemma,\ncontended that it had been concocted by Luie himself. But the damning\nand unanswerable fact remained--that, by his recognition of the man,\r\nthe Claimant had acknowledged a previous acquaintance with him which he\ncould only have had by being privy to the fraud.\n\nOn February 28, 1874, the one hundred and eighty-eighth day of the\ntrial, the jury after half-an-hour’s deliberation returned their\nverdict. They found that the defendant was not Roger Charles\nTichborne; that he was Arthur Orton; and finally that the charges made\nagainst Miss Catherine Doughty were not supported by the slightest\r\nevidence. Orton was sentenced to fourteen years’ penal servitude which,\nassuredly, was none too heavy for offences so enormous. The trial\nwas remarkable, not only for its inordinate length, but also for the\nextraordinary scenes by which it was characterised and for which Dr.\nKenealy, leading counsel for the defence, was primarily responsible.\nHis conduct was sternly denounced by the Lord Chief Justice in his\nsumming up as: “the torrent of undisguised and unlimited abuse in which","the learned counsel for the defence has thought fit to indulge,” and\nhe declared that “there never was in the history of jurisprudence a\ncase in which such an amount of imputation and invective had been used\nbefore.” After the trial was over, Dr. Kenealy tried to turn the case\ninto a national question through the medium of a virulent paper he\nstarted with the title of the _Englishman_; and undeterred by being\ndisbarred for his flagrant breaches of professional etiquette, he went\r\nabout the country delivering the most extravagant speeches concerning\nthe trial. He was elected Member of Parliament for Stoke, and, on April\n23, 1875, moved for a royal commission of inquiry into the conduct of\nthe Tichborne Case; but his motion was defeated by 433 votes to 1.\n\nThe verdict and sentence created enormous excitement throughout the\ncountry, for all classes, more or less, had subscribed to the defence\nfund. But, by the time Orton was released, in 1884, practically\r\nall interest had died away, and his effort to resuscitate it was a\nmiserable failure. In the sworn confession which he published in the\n_People_, in 1895, he told the whole story of the fraud from its\ninception to its final denouement. Orton survived his release from\nprison for fourteen years, but gradually sinking into poverty, he died\nin obscure lodgings in Shouldham Street, Marylebone, on April 1, 1898.\nTo the end he was a fraud and impostor for, before his death, he is\r\nsaid to have recanted his sworn confession, which nevertheless bore the\nstamp of truth and was in perfect accord with the information obtained\nby the prosecution, while his coffin bore the lying inscription: “Sir\nRoger Charles Doughty Tichborne; born 5th January, 1829; died 1st\nApril, 1898.”\n\n\n\n\nVII. WOMEN AS MEN\n\n\nA. THE MOTIVE FOR DISGUISE\n\nOne of the commonest forms of imposture--so common that it seems rooted\nin a phase of human nature--is that of women who disguise themselves\r\nas men. It is not to be wondered at that such attempts are made; or\nthat they were made more often formerly when social advancement had not\nenlarged the scope of work available for women. The legal and economic\ndisabilities of the gentler sex stood then so fixedly in the way of\nworking opportunity that women desirous of making an honest livelihood\ntook desperate chances to achieve their object. We have read of very","many cases in the past; and even now the hum-drum of life is broken by\nthe fact or the echo of some startling revelation of the kind. Only\nvery lately the death of a person who had for many years occupied a\nworthy though humble position in London caused a post-mortem sensation\nby the discovery that the deceased individual, though looked on for\nabout a quarter of a century as a man, a widower, and the father of\na grown-up daughter, was in reality a woman. She was actually buried\r\nunder the name of the man she had professed to be, Harry Lloyd.\n\nIt is not to be wondered at that in more strenuous times, when the\nspirit of adventure was less curbed, and initial difficulties were\nless deadened by convention, cases of concealment of sex were far more\nnumerous and more easily prolonged. In an age of foreign wars, many\nexisting barriers against success in this respect were removed by\ngeneral laxity of social conditions. Perhaps I may be allowed to say at\r\nthe outset that, for my own part, my mind refuses absolutely to accept\nthat which is generally alleged in each case, that the male comrades\nof women concealing their proper sex were, all through, ignorant of\nthe true facts. Human nature is opposed to such a supposition, and\nexperience bears out the shrewdness of nature. On occasions, or even\nfor a time, it is possible to make such successful concealments. But\nwhen we are told that a woman has gone through a whole campaign or a\r\nprolonged voyage in all the overcrowded intimacy of tent and bivouac\nor of cabin and forecastle, without such a secret being suspected or\ndiscovered, the narrator makes an overlarge draft on human credulity.\nThat such comrades, and many of them, forbore to give away the\nsecret, no matter how it had come into their possession, we may well\nbelieve. Comradeship is a strong factor in such matters, and it has\nits own loyalty, which is never stronger than when the various persons\r\ninterested are held together by the knowledge of a common danger.\nBut even to this there is a contra; the whole spirit of romance, even\nwhen it binds man to woman and woman to man, stands side by side with\nlove, affection, passion--call it what you will--which opportunity can\nfan into flame. Never more so than in the strenuous days of fighting,\nwhen day and night are full of varying fears--when the mad turmoil of","working hours and loneliness of the night forge new fetters for the\nbinding together of the sexes.\n\nIn real life, when a man or a woman tries to escape from capture or\nthe fear of it in the guise of the opposite sex, it is a never-ending\nstruggle to sustain the rôle successfully. If this is so, when the\nwhole of the energies of mind and body are devoted in singleness\nof purpose to the task, how then can the imposture be successfully\r\nprolonged when the mind is eternally occupied with the pressing\nthings of the passing moments? There must infallibly be moments of\nself-betrayal; and there is sufficient curiosity in the average person\nto insure that the opportunities of such moments are not lost. Be this\nas it may, we must in the first instance stick to matters of fact; the\nrecord is our sheet-anchor. After all, when we learn of a case where\nan imposture of the kind has been successfully carried out, it is time\r\nenough to argue with convincing perspicacity that it should not have\nbeen possible.\n\nAs to record, there are quite sufficient cases to convince any reader\nas to the fact that, allowing for all possible error and wastage,\nthere have been a sufficient number undetected at the time of their\nhappening, and only made known by after-confession and by the force of\nulterior circumstances. Whatever opinion we may form of the women who\r\ncarried out the venture, there is neither occasion nor need to doubt\nthe fact they were so carried out. The consideration of a few cases\nculled from the records of this class of successful imposture will\nmake this plain. It would be useless, if not impossible, to make full\nlists of the names of women who have passed themselves off as men in\nthe fighting world--soldiers and sailors, with side interests such as\npiracy, duelling, highway robbery, etc. Amongst the female soldiers\r\nare the names of Christian Davis (known as Mother Ross), Hannah Snell,\nPhœbe Hessel. Amongst the sailors those of Mary Talbot, Ann Mills,\nHannah Whitney, Charles Waddell. In the ranks of the pirates are Mary\nReid and Ann Bonney. In many of these cases are underlying romances, as\nof women making search for lost or absconding husbands, or of lovers\nmaking endeavours to regain the lost paradise of life together.\n\nIf there were nothing else in these little histories, their perusal in","detail would well repay attention as affording proof of the boundless\ndevotion of woman’s love. No matter how badly the man may have treated\nthe woman, no matter how heartlessly or badly he may have behaved\ntowards her, her affection was proof against all. Indeed it makes\none believe that there is some subtle self-sustaining, self-ennobling\nquality in womanhood which her initial self-surrender makes a constant\nforce towards good. Even a nature which took new strength from the\r\nturmoil of battle, from the harrowing suspense of perpetual vigil, from\nthe strain of physical weakness bravely borne, from pain and want and\nhunger, instead of hardening into obstinate indifference, seems to have\nsoftened as to sentiment, and been made gentle as to memory, as though\nthe sense of wrong had been purged by the forces of affliction. All\nthis, though the stress of campaigning may have blunted some of the\nconventional susceptibility of womanhood. For the after life of some of\r\nthese warlike heroines showed that they had lost none of the love of\nadmiration which marks their sex, none of their satisfaction in posing\nas characters other than their own. Several of them found pleasure in a\nnew excitement different from that of battle, in the art of the stage.\nWhenever any of them made any effort to settle down in life after their\nexcitement in the life of the camp or the sea, such did so at some\r\nplace, and in some way congenial to herself and consistent with the\nlife which she was leaving.\n\n\nB. HANNAH SNELL\n\nHannah Snell is a good instance of how the life of a woman who was not\nby nature averse from adventure was moulded by chance in the direction\nwhich suited her individuality. Of course, liking for a militant life,\nwhether in conventional or exceptional form, presupposes a natural\nboldness of spirit, resolution, and physical hardihood--all of which\r\nthis woman possessed in an eminent degree.\n\nShe was born at Worcester in 1723, one of the family of a hosier who\nhad three sons and six daughters. In 1740, when her father and mother\nwere dead, she went to live at Wapping with a sister who had married a\nship carpenter named Gray. There she married a Dutch sailor, who before\nher baby was born, had squandered such little property as her father\nhad left her, and then deserted her. She went back to her sister, in","whose house the baby died. In 1743, she made up her mind to search for\nher husband. To this end she put on man’s clothes and a man’s name\n(that of her brother-in-law) and enlisted in General Guise’s regiment.\nAt Carlisle, whither the regiment was sent she learned something of\na soldier’s duties. In doing so she was selected by her sergeant, a\nman called Davis, to help him in carrying out a criminal love affair.\nIn order to be able to warn the girl she pretended acquiescence. In\r\nrevenge the sergeant reported her for an alleged neglect of some\nduty for which according to the barbarous system of the time she was\nsentenced to 600 lashes; of these she had actually received 500 when\non the intervention of some of the officers the remaining hundred\nwere foregone. After this, fearing further aggression on the part of\nthe revengeful petty officer she deserted. She walked all the way to\nPortsmouth--a journey which occupied a whole month--where she again\r\nenlisted as a marine in Fraser’s regiment, which was shortly ordered\non foreign service to the East Indies. There was a storm on the way\nout, during which she worked manfully at the pumps. When the ship had\npassed Gibraltar there was another bad storm in which she was wrecked.\nHannah Snell found her way to Madeira and thence to the Cape of Good\nHope. Her ship joined in the taking of Arcacopong on the Coromandel\nCoast; in which action Hannah fought so bravely that she was praised\r\nby her officers. Later on she assisted in the siege of Pondicherry\nwhich lasted nearly three months before it had to be abandoned. In the\nfinal attempt she served on picket duty and had to ford, under fire,\na river breast high. During the struggle she received six bullets\nin the right leg, five in the left leg, and one in the abdomen. Her\nfear was not of death but discovery of her sex through the last-named\nwound. By the friendly aid of a black woman, however, she avoided this","danger. She managed to extract the bullet herself, with her finger and\nthumb, and the wound made a good cure. This wound caused her a delay\nof some weeks during which her ship had to leave for Bombay and was\ndelayed five weeks by a leak. Poor Hannah was again unfortunate in her\nofficers; one of them to whom she had refused to sing had her put in\nirons and given a dozen lashes. In 1749 she went to Lisbon, where she\nlearned by chance that her husband had met at Genoa the death penalty\r\nby drowning, for a murder which he had committed. Discovery of her sex\nand her identity would have been doubly dangerous now; but happily she\nwas able to conceal her alarm and so escaped detection. She got back to\nLondon through Spithead and once more found shelter in the house of her\nsister who at once recognised her in spite of her disguise. Her fine\nsinging voice, which had already caused her to be flogged, now stood\r\nher in good stead. She applied for and obtained an engagement at the\nRoyalty theatre, Wellclose square; and appeared with success as _Bill\nBobstay_ a sailor and _Firelock_ a soldier. She remained on the stage\nfor some months, always wearing male dress. The government of the day\ngave her, on account of the hardships she had endured, a pension of £20\nper annum. Later on she took a public-house at Wapping. The sign of her\nhostelry became noted. On one side of it was painted in effigy _The\r\nBritish Tar_ and on the other _The Valiant Marine_, and underneath _The\nWidow in masquerade_, or the _Female Warrior_.\n\nAs Hannah appeared during her adventurous career as both soldier and\nsailor she affords, in herself, an illustrious example of female\ncourage as well as female duplicity in both of the services.\n\n\nC. LA MAUPIN\n\nThe majority of the readers of the English-speaking race who enjoy\nThéophile Gautier’s fascinating romance _Mademoiselle de Maupin_ are\r\nnot aware that the heroine was a real person. The novelist has of\ncourse made such alterations as are required to translate crude fact\ninto more elegant fiction, and to obliterate so far as can be done the\ncriminal or partly-criminal aspect of the lady’s venturous career. But\nsuch is one of the chief duties of an artist in fiction. Though he\nmay be an historian, in a sense, he is not limited to the occasional\nbareness of truth. His object is not that his work shall be true but","rather what the French call _vraisemblable_. In narrative, as in most\narts, crudeness is rather a fault than a virtue, so that the writer\nwho looks for excellence in his work has without losing force, to fill\nup the blanks left by the necessary excision of fact by subtleties of\nthought and graces of description, so that the fulness or rotundity\nof the natural curves shall always be maintained. In truth the story\r\nof _La Maupin_ is so laden with passages of excitement and interest\nthat any writer on the subject has only to make an agreeable choice\nof episodes sufficiently dramatic, and consistent with each other,\nto form a cohesive narrative. Such a work has in it possibilities of\ngreat success--if only the author has the genius of a Théophile Gautier\nto set it forth. The real difficulty which such an one would have\nto contend against would be to remove the sordidness, the reckless\r\npassion, the unscrupulousness, the criminal intent which lies behind\nsuch a character.\n\nThe Mademoiselle de Maupin of real life was a singer at the Opera in\nParis at the end of the seventeenth century. She was the daughter\nof a man of somewhat humble extraction engaged in secretarial work\nwith the Count d’Armagnac; and whilst only a girl married a man named\nMaupin employed in the province. With him she had lived only a few\nmonths when she ran away with a maitre d’armes (_anglicè_, a fencing\r\nmaster) named Serane. If this individual had no other good quality in\nmatters human or divine, he was at least a good teacher of the sword.\nHis professional arts were used in the service of his inamorata, who\nbecame herself an excellent swordsman even in an age when swordsmanship\nhad an important place in social life. It may have been the sexual\nequality implied by the name which gave the young woman the idea, but\nthenceforth she became a man in appearance;--in reality, in so far as\r\nsuch a metamorphosis can be accomplished by courage, recklessness,\nhardihood, unscrupulousness, and a willing obedience to all the ideas\nwhich passion and sensuality can originate and a greed of notoriety\ncarry into execution.\n\nIn a professional tour from Paris to Marseilles, in which she as an\nactress took the part of a man, she gained the affections of the\nflighty daughter of a rich merchant of Marseilles; and, as a man, ran","away with her. Being pursued, they sought refuge in a convent--a place\nwhich at that age it was manifestly easier to get into than to get\nout of. Here the two remained for a few days, during which, by the\naid of histrionic and other arts, the actress obviated the necessary\nsuspicions of her foolish companion and kept danger away. All the while\nLa Maupin was conscious that an irate and rich father was in hot search\nfor his missing daughter, and she knew that any talk about the venture\r\nwould infallibly lose her the girl’s fortune, besides getting herself\nwithin the grip of the law. So she decided on a bold scheme of escape\nfrom the convent, whereby she might obliterate her tracks. A nun of\nthe convent had died and her body was awaiting burial. In the night La\nMaupin exchanged the body of the dead nun for the living one of her own\nvictim. Having thus got her companion out of the convent, she set the\r\nbuilding on fire to cover up everything, and escaped in secret to a\nneighbouring village, taking with her by force the girl, who naturally\nenough was disillusioned and began to have scruples as to the wisdom\nof her conduct. In the village they remained hidden for a few weeks,\nduring which time the repentance of the poor girl became a fixed\nquantity. An attempt, well supported, was made to arrest the ostensible\nman; but this was foiled by the female swordsman who killed one of the\r\nwould-be captors and dangerously wounded two others. The girl, however,\nmade good her escape; secretly she fled from her deceiver and reached\nher parents in safety. But the hue and cry was out after La Maupin,\nwhose identity was now known. She was pursued, captured, and placed\nin gaol to await trial. The law was strong and inexorable; the erring\nwoman who had thus outraged so many conventions was condemned to be\nburned alive.\r\nBut abstract law and the executive are quite different things--at least\nthey were in France at the close of the seventeenth century: as indeed\nthey are occasionally in other countries and at varying times. La\nMaupin, being a woman and a clever one, procured sufficient influence\nto have the execution postponed, and so had the full punishment\ndelayed, if not entirely avoided. More than this, she managed to get\nback to Paris and so to begin her noxious career all over again. Of","course she had strong help from her popularity. She was a favourite at\nthe opera, and the class which patronises and supports this kind of\nartistic effort is a rich and powerful one, which governments do not\ncare to displease by the refusal of such a small favour as making the\nlaw hold its hand with regard to an erring favourite.\n\nBut La Maupin’s truculent tendencies were not to be restrained. In\nParis in 1695 whilst she was one of the audience at a theatre she took\r\numbrage at some act or speech of one of the comedians playing in the\npiece, and leaving her seat went round to the stage and caned him in\nthe presence of the audience. The actor, M. Dumenil, an accomplished\nand favourite performer but a man of peaceful disposition, submitted\nto the affront and took no action in the matter. La Maupin, however,\nsuffered, through herself, the penalty of her conduct. She had\nentered on a course of violence which became a habit. For some years\r\nshe flourished and exercised all the tyrannies of her own sex and\nin addition those habitual to men which came from expert use of the\nsword. Thus she went attired as a man to a ball given by a Prince of\nthe blood. In that garb she treated a fellow-guest, a woman, with\nindecency; and she was challenged by three different men--each of\nwhom, when the consequent fight came on, she ran through the body,\nafter which she returned to the ball. Shortly afterwards she fought\r\nand wounded a man, M. de Servan, who had affronted a woman. For these\nescapades she was again pardoned. She then went to Brussels where she\nlived under the protection of Count Albert of Bavaria, the Elector.\nWith him she remained until the quarrel, inevitable in such a life,\ncame. After much bickering he agreed to her demand of a settlement,\nbut in order to show his anger by affronting her he sent the large\namount of his involuntary bequest by the servile hand of the husband\r\nof his mistress, Countess d’Arcos, who had supplanted her, with a\ncurt message that she must leave Brussels at once. The bearer of such\na message to such a woman as La Maupin had probably reckoned on an\nunfriendly reception; but he evidently underestimated her anger. Not\ncontented with flinging at his head the large _douceur_ of which he was\nthe bearer, she expressed in her direct way her unfavourable opinion,\nof him, of his master, and of the message which he had carried for","the latter. She ended her tirade by kicking him downstairs, with the\njustification for her form of physical violence that she would not\nsully her sword with his blood.\n\nFrom Brussels she went to Spain as _femme de chambre_ to the Countess\nMarino but returned to Paris in 1704. Once more she took up her work as\nan opera singer; or rather she tried to take it up, but she had lost\nher vogue, and the public would have none of her. As a matter of fact,\r\nshe was only just above thirty years of age, which should under normal\ncircumstances be the beginning of a woman’s prime. But the life she\nhad been leading since her early girlhood was not one which made for\ntrue happiness or for physical health; she was prematurely old, and her\nartistic powers were worn out.\n\nStill, her pluck, and the obstinacy on which it was grafted, remained.\nFor a whole year she maintained a never-failing struggle for her old\r\nsupremacy, but without avail. Seeing that all was lost, she left the\nstage and returned to her husband who, realising that she was rich,\nmanaged to reconcile whatever shreds of honour he had to her infamous\nrecord. The Church, too, accepted her--and her riches--within its\nsheltering portals. By the aid of a tolerant priest she got absolution,\nand two years after her retirement from the opera she died in a convent\nin all the odour of sanctity.\r\nD. MARY EAST\n\nThe story of Mary East is a pitiful one, and gives a picture of\nthe civil life of the eighteenth century which cannot be lightly\nforgotten. The condition of things has so changed that already we\nalmost need a new terminology in order that we may understand as our\ngreat-grandfathers did. Take for instance the following sentence and\ntry individually how many points in it there are, the full meaning of\nwhich we are unable to understand:\r\n“A young fellow courted one Mary East, and for him she conceived the\ngreatest liking; but he going upon the highway, was tried for a robbery\nand cast, but was afterwards transported.”\n\nThe above was written by an accomplished scholar, a Doctor of Divinity,\nrector of an English parish. At the time of its writing, 1825, every\nword of it was entirely comprehensible. If a reader of that time could\nsee it translated into modern phraseology he would be almost as much","surprised as we are when we look back upon an age holding possibilities\nno longer imaginable.\n\n“Going upon the highway” was in Mary East’s time and a hundred years\nlater a euphemism for becoming a highway robber; “cast” meant condemned\nto death; “transported” meant exiled to a far distant place where one\nwas guarded, and escape from which was punishable with death. Moreover\nrobbery was at this time a capital offence.\n\nIn 1736, when Mary East was sixteen, life was especially hard on women.\r\nFew honest occupations were open to them, and they were subject to all\nthe hardships consequent on a system in which physical weakness was\nhandicapped to a frightful extent. When this poor girl was bereft of\nher natural hope of a settlement in life she determined, as the least\nunattractive form of living open to her, to remain single. About the\nsame time a friend of hers arrived at the same resolution but by a\ndifferent road, her course being guided thereto by having “met with\r\nmany crosses in love.” The two girls determined to join forces; and\non consulting as to ways and means decided that the likeliest way to\navoid suspicion was to live together under the guise of man and wife.\nThe toss of a coin decided their respective rôles, the “breeches part”\nas it is called in the argot of the theatre, falling to East. The\ncombined resources of the girls totalled some thirty pounds sterling,\nso after buying masculine garb for Mary they set out to find a place\r\nwhere they were unknown and so might settle down in peace. They found\nthe sort of place they sought in the neighbourhood of Epping Forest\nwhere, there being a little public-house vacant, Mary--now under the\nname of James How--became the tenant. For some time they lived in peace\nat Epping, with the exception of a quarrel forced by a young gentleman\non the alleged James How in which the latter was wounded in the hand.\nIt must have been a very one-sided affair, for when the injured “man”\r\ntook action he was awarded £500 damages--a large sum in those days\nand for such a cause. With this increase to their capital the two\nwomen moved to Limehouse on the east side of London where they took at\nLimehouse-hole a more important public-house. This they managed in so\nexcellent a manner that they won the respect of their neighbours and\nthrove exceedingly.\n\nAfter a time they moved from Limehouse to Poplar where they bought","another house and added to their little estate by the purchase of other\nhouses.\n\nPeace, hard work, and prosperity marked their life thence-forward, till\nfourteen years had passed since the beginning of their joint venture.\n\nPeace and prosperity are, however, but feeble guardians to weakness.\nNay, rather are they incentive to evil doing. For all these years\nthe two young women had conducted themselves with such rectitude,\r\nand observed so much discretion, that even envy could not assail\nthem through the web of good repute which they had woven round their\nmasquerade. Alone they lived, keeping neither female servant nor male\nassistant. They were scrupulously honest in their many commercial\ndealings and, absolutely punctual in their agreements and obligations.\nJames How took a part in the public life of his locality, filling in\nturn every parish office except those of Constable and Churchwarden.\r\nFrom the former he was excused on account of the injury to his hand\nfrom which he had never completely recovered. Regarding the other his\ntime had not yet come, but he was named for Churchwarden in the year\nfollowing to that in which a bolt fell from the blue, 1730. It came\nin this wise: A woman whose name of coverture was Bently, and who was\nnow resident in Poplar, had known the alleged James How in the days\nwhen they were both young. Her own present circumstances were poor\r\nand she looked on the prosperity of her old acquaintance as a means\nto her own betterment. It was but another instance of the old crime\nof “blackmail.” She sent to the former Mary East for a loan of £10,\nintimating that if the latter did not send it she would make known the\nsecret of her sex. The poor panic-stricken woman foolishly complied\nwith the demand, thus forcing herself deeper into the mire of the other\nwoman’s unscrupulousness. The forced loan, together with Bently’s\r\nfears for her own misdeed procured immunity for some fifteen years from\nfurther aggression. At the end of that time, however, under the renewed\npressure of need Bently repeated her demand. “James How” had not the\nsum by her, but she sent £5--another link in the chain of her thraldom.\n\nFrom that time on there was no more peace for poor Mary East. Her\ncompanion of nearly thirty-five years died and she, having a secret\nto guard and no assistance being possible, was more helpless than","ever and more than ever under the merciless yoke of the blackmailer.\nMrs. Bently had a fair idea of how to play her own despicable game.\nAs her victim’s fear was her own stock-in-trade she supplemented the\nsense of fear which she knew to exist by a conspiracy strengthened by\nall sorts of schemes to support its seeming _bona fides_. She took\nin two male accomplices and, thus enforced, began operations. Her\nconfederates called on James How, one armed with a constable’s staff,\r\nthe other appearing as one of the “thief-takers” of the gang of the\nnotorious magistrate, Fielding--an evil product of an evil time. Having\nconfronted How they told him that they had come by order of Mr. Justice\nFielding to arrest him for the commission of a robbery over forty years\nbefore, alleging that they were aware of his being a woman. Mary East,\nthough quite innocent of any such offence but acutely conscious of her\r\nimposture of manhood, in her dismay sought the aid of a friend called\nWilliams who understood and helped her. He went to the magistrates\nof the district and then to Sir John Fielding to make inquiries and\nclaim protection. During his absence the two villains took Mary East\nfrom her house and by threats secured from her a draft on Williams\nfor £100. With this in hand they released their victim who was even\nmore anxious than themselves not to let the matter have greater\r\npublicity than it had already obtained. However, Justice demanded a\nfurther investigation, and one of the men being captured--the other\nhad escaped--was tried, and being found guilty, was sentenced to\nimprisonment for four years together with four appearances in the\npillory.\n\nAltogether Mary East and her companion had lived together as husband\nand wife for nearly thirty-five years, during which time they had\nhonestly earned, and by self-denial saved, over four thousand pounds\r\nsterling and won the good opinion of all with whom they had come in\ncontact. They were never known to cook a joint of meat for their own\nuse, to employ any help, or to entertain private friends in their\nhouse. They were cautious, careful, and discreet in every way and\nseemed to live their lives in exceeding blamelessness.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. HOAXES, ETC.\n\n\nThere is a class of imposture which must be kept apart from others","of its kind, or at least ear-marked in such wise that there can be\nno confusion of ideas regarding it. This includes all sorts of acts\nwhich, though often attended with something of the same result as other\nefforts to mislead, are yet distinguished from them by intention. They\nhave--whatever may be their results--a jocular and humorous intention.\nSuch performances are called hoaxes. These, though amusing to their\nperpetrators and to certain sportive persons, and though generally\r\ncausing a due amount of pain and loss to those on whom they are\ninflicted, usually escape the condign and swift punishment which they\ndeserve. It is generally held that humour, like charity, covereth a\nmultitude of sins. So be it. We are all grateful for a laugh no matter\nwho may suffer.\n\n\nA. TWO LONDON HOAXES\n\nNot many years ago, in one of the popular dairy-refreshment shops in\nHolborn, the prim manageress and her white-capped waitresses were just\r\ncommencing their day’s work when a couple of sturdy green-aproned men\nswooped down on the place from a large pantechnicon van, and to the\namazement of the young ladies commenced to clear the shop.\n\n“There you are Bill. Hand up them chairs, and look slippy.”\n\n“Right o’, mate.”\n\n“Good gracious me, what are you men doing?” shrieked the alarmed\nmanageress.\n\n“Doing, miss, doing? Why moving the furniture. This is the lot ain’t\nit?”\r\n“No, no, no; there must be some mistake. You must have come to the\nwrong place.”\n\n“Mistake, wrong place? No miss. ’Ere, look where’s that letter?” And\nJack placed a begrimed document before the lady.\n\nThe letter seemed right enough. It read beautifully, a plain direction\nto clear the shop and remove the stuff elsewhere; it only lacked the\nofficial heading of the company. But the joint inspection was rudely\nbroken in upon by the arrival of a couple of the knights of the brush\r\nwho had come “to do the chimbley, maam”; and ere they could be disposed\nof vans of coals began to draw up, more pantechnicons, more sweeps,\nloads of furniture, butchers with prime joints, plump birds from the\npoulterers, fish of every conceivable kind, noisy green-grocer boys,\nstaggering under huge loads of vegetables; florists “to decorate,”\ngasfitters, carpenters “to take down the counter, miss”; others “to put\nit up.”\n\n       *       *       *       *       *","Pandemonium is quiet compared with that shop. The poor manageress was\nin tears, deafened with the exasperated, swearing representatives\nof, apparently, all the tradesmen for miles around. The thing had\nbeen well done. No sooner had the provision merchants worked clear\nand the streams of vans, waggons and carts been backed away to the\naccompaniment of much lurid language, than ladies began to arrive with\nboxes of mysterious long garments which, they assured the indignant\r\nlady in charge, they were instructed were urgently needed for an event\nthey referred to as “interesting.” There was no monotony, for fast and\nfurious--very furious sometimes--came other maidens laden with more\nboxes and still more boxes, filled with costumes, bonnets, and other\ncreations dear to the feminine mind. Then came servants “in answer to\nyour advertisement, madam.” They flocked in from all directions, north,\nsouth, east and west. Never was seen such a concourse of servants:\r\ndignified housekeepers, housemaids, parlourmaids, and every other\nsort of maid, seemed to be making for that unfortunate manageress.\nSleek-looking butlers popped in, as uniformed nurses popped out.\nWindow-cleaners had to be torn from the windows they insisted they\nhad got orders to clean; carpet beaters sought carpets which did not\nexist. Never had mortal--aye and immortal--requirements been thought\nout with more thoughtful care. From the needs of the unborn baby, to\r\nthe “poor departed one,” whom melancholy gentlemen in seedy black came\nto measure, all were remembered, and the man for whose especial benefit\npresumably were intended beautiful wreaths, crosses, harps, etc., which\nkept constantly arriving. Throughout that live-long day to the “dewy\neve” beloved of the poet the game went merrily on.\n\nAs a hoax the thing was worked for all it was worth. Not only had\nshoals of letters evidently been sent out, but advertisements, too, had\r\nbeen freely distributed among the press. Needless to say that, despite\nthe closest investigations, its author or authors, discreetly silent,\nremained unknown.\n\nThe joke was not new by any means. Well nigh a century before\nmischief-loving Theodore Hook had stirred all London by a similar\nprank--the famous Berners Street Hoax. In those days Berners Street was\na quiet thoroughfare inhabited by fairly well-to-do families. Indeed","it was this very sedate quietness which drew upon it Hook’s unwelcome\nattention. Fixing on one of the houses, which happened to be adorned\nwith a brass plate, he made a wager with a brother wag that he would\ncause that particular house to become the talk of the town: and he\ncertainly did--for not only the town, but all England shrieked with\nlaughter when the result of his little manœuvre became known.\n\nOne morning, soon after breakfast, waggons laden with coals began\r\nto draw up before the house with the brass plate, No. 54. These\nwere quickly succeeded with tradespeople by the dozen with various\ncommodities. These in turn were followed by van loads of furniture;\nfollowed by a hearse with a coffin and a number of mourning coaches.\nSoon the street became choked: for, what with the goods dumped down\nas near as possible to the house--pianos, organs, and cart loads of\nfurniture of all descriptions, the anxious tradesmen, and the laughing\r\nmob of people quickly attracted to the scene, confusion reigned\nsupreme. About this time the Lord Mayor and other notabilities began\nto arrive in their carriages. His Lordship’s stay was short. He was\ndriven to Marlborough Street police office where he informed the\nmagistrate that he had received a note purporting to come from Mrs.\nT., the victimised widow resident at No. 54, saying she was confined\nto her room and begging his lordship to do her the favour of calling\r\non her on important business. Meanwhile, the trouble in Berners\nStreet was growing serious, and officers belonging to the Marlborough\nStreet office were at once sent to keep order. For a time even they\nwere helpless. Never was such a strange meeting: barbers with wigs;\nmantlemakers with band-boxes; opticians with their various articles of\ntrade. Presently there arrived a couple of fashionable physicians, an\naccoucheur, and a dentist. There were clockmakers, carpet manufacturers\r\nand wine merchants, all loaded with specimens of their trade; brewers\nwith barrels of ale, curiosity dealers with sundry knickknacks;\ncartloads of potatoes; books, prints, jewellery, feathers and furbelows\nof all kinds; ices and jellies; conjuring tricks; never was such a\nconglomeration. Then, about five o’clock servants of all kinds began\nto troop in to apply for situations. For a time the police officers","were powerless. Vehicles were jammed and interlocked; the exasperated\ndrivers were swearing, and the disappointed tradesmen were maddened\nby the malicious fun of the crowd who were enjoying the joke. Some\nof the vans were overturned and many of the tradesmens’ goods came\nto grief; while some of the casks of ale became the prey of the\ndelighted spectators. All through the day and late into the night this\nextraordinary state of things continued, to the dismay and terror of\r\nthe poor lady and the other inmates of the house with the brass plate.\n\nTheodore Hook had taken precautions to secure a good seat for the\nperformance, having taken furnished-apartments just opposite the house\nof his victim, where he posted himself with one or two companions to\nenjoy the scene. Hook’s connection with the mad joke was, fortunately\nfor him, not known until long afterwards; it seems he had devoted three\nor four whole days to writing the letters, all couched in ladylike\r\nstyle. In the end the novelist seems to have been rather frightened at\nthe result of his little joke, for he made a speedy departure to the\ncountry; and there is no doubt that, had he been publicly known as its\nauthor, he would have fared badly.\n\n\nB. THE CAT HOAX\n\nOne very amusing variation of the countless imitations, which the\nsuccess of this trick gave rise to, was the “cat hoax” at Chester,\nin August, 1815. It was at the time when it had been determined to\r\nsend Napoleon to St. Helena. One morning, a number of hand bills were\ndistributed in and around Chester, stating that, owing to the island of\nSt. Helena being invested with rats, the government required a number\nof cats for deportation. Sixteen shillings were offered for “every\nathletic full-grown tom cat, ten shillings for every adult female\npuss, and a half-crown for every thriving kitten that could swill\nmilk, pursue a ball of thread, or fasten its young fangs in a dying\r\nmouse.” An address was given at which the cats were to be delivered;\nbut it proved to be an empty house. The advertisement resulted in the\nvictimisation of hundreds of people. Men, women, and children streamed\ninto the city from miles around laden with cats of every description.\nSome hundreds were brought in, and the scene before the door of the\nempty house is said to have baffled description. When the hoax was","discovered many of the cats were liberated; the following morning no\nless than five hundred dead cats were counted floating down the river\nDee.\n\n\nC. THE MILITARY REVIEW\n\nPractical jokes of this nature have more than once led to serious\nresults. In the summer of 1812 a report was extensively circulated that\na grand military review was to be held on the 19th of June. Booths were\nerected and as many as twenty thousand people assembled, despite the\r\nefforts of the authorities who, when they learned what was happening,\nposted men in the several roads leading to the heath to warn the people\nthat they had been hoaxed. But their efforts were useless. The rumour\nwas believed and the contradiction ignored; vehicles, horsemen and\npedestrians pushed on to their destination. When, however, the day wore\non without any appearance of the promised military pageant, the crowd\ngrew angry and then broke out in acts of violence. The heath was set on\r\nfire. Messengers were sent off express to London, and a detachment of\nthe guards had to be marched down to quell the mob. In the disorder one\npoor woman was thrown out of a chaise and picked up in an unconscious\ncondition.\n\n\nD. THE TOLL-GATE\n\nMany distinguished actors have been very fond of playing practical\njokes and perpetrating hoaxes. Young, the tragedian, was one day\ndriving in a gig with a friend on the outskirts of London. Pulling\r\nup at a turn-pike gate he noticed the name of the toll-collector\nwritten up over the door. Calling to him the woman, the wife of that\nfunctionary, who appeared to be in charge of the gate, he politely\ntold her that he particularly wished to see Mr. ----, naming the\ntoll-collector, on a matter of importance. Impressed by Young’s manner,\nshe promptly sent for her husband, who was working in a neighbouring\nfield. Hastily washing himself and putting on a clean coat he presented\r\nhimself. The actor gravely said: “I paid for a ticket at the last gate,\nand was told that it would free me through this one. As I wish to be\nscrupulously exact, will you kindly tell me whether such is the case?”\n“Why of course it is?” “Can I then pass through without paying?” The\ntoll-collector’s reply and his vituperation as the travellers passed on\nhad better, perhaps, be left to the imagination.\n\n\nE. THE MARRIAGE HOAX\n\nHoaxes are sometimes malicious, and often cruel, as the following","instance will show: A young couple were about to be married in\nBirmingham when those officiating--it was a Jewish wedding--were\nstartled by the delivery of a telegram from London with the message:\n“Stop marriage at once. His wife and children have arrived in London\nand will come on to Birmingham.” The bride fainted and the bridegroom\nwas frantically perturbed at thus summarily being provided with a\nwife and family. But it was useless; the unhappy man had to make the\r\nbest of his way through an exasperated crowd full of sympathy for the\nwronged girl. Inquiry, however, showed her friends that the whole thing\nwas a hoax--possibly worked by some revengeful rival of the man whose\nhappiness had been so unexpectedly deferred.\n\n\nF. BURIED TREASURE\n\nMost people have heard of the “Spanish Treasure swindle” and, though\nless elaborate than the original, a variation of it practised on a\r\nFrench merchant was rather “cute.” One morning he received an anonymous\ncommunication advising him that a box of treasure was buried in his\ngarden the exact position of which would be pointed out to him, if\nhe agreed to divide the spoil. He rose at once to the bait, met his\ngenerous informant, and before long the pair were merrily at work\nwith pickaxe and shovel. Sure enough before long their exertions\nwere awarded by the unearthing of a box full of silver coins. The\r\nhoard proved to consist of sixteen hundred five-franc pieces; and\nthe delighted merchant, after carefully counting them out into two\npiles, offered one lot to his partner as his share. That worthy, after\ncontemplating the heap for a minute or two, observed that it would\nbe rather a heavy load to carry to the railway station, and said he\nwould prefer, if it could be managed, to have the amount in gold or\nnotes. “Certainly, certainly!” was the reply. The two men walked up to\r\nthe house and the business was settled to their mutual satisfaction.\nTwenty-four hours later, the merchant took a very different view of\nthe transaction; for examination discovered there was not one genuine\nfive-franc piece among the whole lot.\n\n\nG. DEAN SWIFT’S HOAX\n\nOne of the most beautiful hoaxes ever perpetrated was one for which\nSwift was responsible. He caused a broad-sheet to be printed and\ncirculated which purported to be the “last dying speech” of one","Elliston, a street robber, in which the condemned thief was made to\nsay: “Now as I am a dying man, I have done something which may be of\nuse to the public. I have left with an honest man--the only honest man\nI was ever acquainted with--the names of all my wicked brethren, the\nplaces of their abode, with a short account of the chief crimes they\nhave committed, in many of which I have been their accomplice, and\nheard the rest from their own mouths. I have likewise set down names of\r\nthose we call our setters, of the wicked houses we frequent, and all\nof those who receive and buy our stolen goods. I have solemnly charged\nthis honest man, and have received his promise upon oath, that whenever\nhe hears of any rogue to be tried for robbery or housebreaking, he\nwill look into his list, and if he finds the name there of the thief\nconcerned, to send the whole paper to the Government. Of this I here\ngive my companions fair and public warning, and hope they will take\r\nit.” So successful, we are told, was the Dean’s ruse that, for many\nyears afterwards, street robberies were almost unknown.\n\n\nH. HOAXED BURGLARS\n\nThe above ingenious device recalls another occasion when some gentlemen\nwho made burglary their profession, and who had been paying a midnight\nvisit to the house of a Hull tradesman were sadly “sold.” They found\nthe cash-box lying handy, and, to their delight, weighty; so heavy\r\nindeed that they did not stay to help themselves to anything further.\nNext morning the cash-box was found not far from the shop and its\ncontents in an ash-pit close by. After all the trouble they had taken,\nto say nothing of the risks they had run, the burglars found their\nprize consisted only of a lump of lead, and that their intended victim\nhad been too artful for them.\n\n\nI. BOGUS SAUSAGES\n\nAs an example of how a dishonest penny may be turned the following\nincident would be hard to beat.\r\nTwo weary porters at the King’s Cross terminus of the Great Northern\nRailway were thinking about going home, when a breathless,\nsimple-looking countryman rushed up to them with anxious enquiries for\na certain train. It had gone. He was crushed. “Whatever was he to do?\nHe had been sent up from Cambridge with a big hamper of those sausages\nfor which the University town is celebrated--a very special order. Was\nthere no other train?” “No.” The poor fellow seemed overwhelmed. “As","it is too late to find another market,” he complained, “the whole lot\nwill be lost.” Then a happy thought seemed to strike him as more of\nthe railway men gathered round, and he inquired ingratiatingly, “Would\nyou care to buy the sausages; if you would, you could have them for\nfourpence a pound? If I keep them, they will probably go bad before\nI can dispose of them.” The idea took--“Real Cambridge Sausages” at\nfourpence a pound was not to be sneezed at. The dainties, neatly packed\r\nin pounds, went like the proverbial hot cakes. Shouldering the empty\nbasket, and bidding his customers a kindly goodnight, the yokel set\noff to find a humble lodging for the night. Grateful smiles greeted\nthe purchasers when they got home. Frying pans were got out and the\nsausages were popped in, and never was such a sizzling heard in the\nrailway houses--or rather never should such a sizzling have been heard.\nBut somehow they didn’t sizzle. “They are uncommon dry; seem to have\r\nno fat in ’em,” said the puzzled cook. They were dry, very dry, for\ncloser investigation showed that the “prime Cambridge” were nothing\nbut skins stuffed with dry bread! The railway staff of King’s Cross\nwere long anxious to meet that simple countryman from Cambridge.\n\n\nJ. THE MOON HOAX\n\nOne of the most stupendous hoaxes, and one foisted on the credulity of\nthe public with the most complete success, was the famous Moon Hoax\r\nwhich was published in the pages of the New York _Sun_ in 1835. It\npurported to be an account of the great astronomical discoveries of\nSir John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope, through the medium of a\nmighty telescope, a single lens of which weighed nearly seven tons.\nIt was stated to be reproduced from the Supplement to the Edinburgh\n_Journal of Science_, though as a matter of fact, the _Journal_ had\nthen been defunct some years. In graphic language, and with a wealth\r\nof picturesque detail, the wonders of the Moon as revealed to the\ngreat astronomer and his assistants were set forth. A great inland\nsea was observed, and “fairer shores never angel coasted on a tour\nof pleasure.” The beach was “of brilliant white sand, girt with wild\ncastellated rocks apparently of green marble, varied at chasms,\noccurring every two hundred feet, with grotesque blocks of chalk or\ngypsum, and feathered and festooned at the summit with the clustering","foliage of unknown trees.” There were hills of amethysts “of a diluted\nclaret colour”; mountains fringed with virgin gold; herds of brown\nquadrupeds resembling diminutive bison fitted with a sort of “hairy\nveil” to protect their eyes from the extremes of light and darkness;\nstrange monsters--a combination of unicorn and goat; pelicans, cranes,\nstrange amphibious creatures, and a remarkable biped beaver. The last\nwas said to resemble the beaver of the earth excepting that it had\r\nno tail and walked only upon its two feet. It carried its young in\nits arms like a human-being, and its huts were constructed better and\nhigher than those of many savage tribes; and, from the smoke, there was\nno doubt it was acquainted with the use of fire. Another remarkable\nanimal observed, was described as having an amazingly long neck, a head\nlike a sheep, bearing two spiral horns, a body like a deer, but with\r\nits fore-legs disproportionately long as also its tail which was very\nbushy and of a snowy whiteness, curling high over its rump and hanging\ntwo or three feet by its side.\n\nBut even these marvels fade into insignificance compared with the\ndiscovery of the lunarian men “four feet in height, covered, except\non the face, with short and glossy copper-coloured hair, with wings\ncomposed of a thin membrane.” “In general symmetry they were infinitely\r\nsuperior to the orang-outang”--which statement could hardly have\nbeen regarded as complimentary; and, though described as “doubtless\ninnocent and happy creatures,” the praise was rather discounted by\nthe mention that some of their amusements would “but ill comport with\nour terrestrial notions of decorum.” In the “Vale of the Triads,”\nwith beautiful temples built of polished sapphire, a superior race of\nthe punariant were found, “eminently happy and even polite,” eating\r\ngourds and red cucumbers; and further afield yet another race of the\nvespertilio-homo, or man-bat, were seen through the wonderful telescope\nof “infinitely greater personal beauty ... scarcely less lovely than\nthe general representation of angels.”\n\nSuch were a few of the marvels told of in the Moon story; and, though\none may laugh at them as they stand, shorn of their clever verbiage and\nquasi-scientific detail, at the time of publication they were seriously","accepted, for the popular mind, even among the educated classes, was\nthen imbued with the fanciful anticipators of vast lunar discoveries\nheralded in the astronomical writings of Thomas Dick, LL.D., of the\nUnion College of New York. Scarcely anything could have been brought\nforward too extravagant for the general credulity on the subject then\nprevailing; and this well-timed satire, “out-heroding Herod” in its\nimaginative creations, supplied to satiety the morbid appetite for\r\nscientific wonders then raging. By its plausible display of scientific\nerudition it successfully duped, with few exceptions, the whole\ncivilised world.\n\nAt the time, the hoax was very generally attributed to a French\nastronomer, M. Nicollet, a legitimist who fled to America in 1830. He\nwas said to have written it with the twofold object of raising the\nwind, and of “taking in” Arago, a rival astronomer. But its real author\r\nwas subsequently found to be Richard Adams Locke, who declared that\nhis original intention was to satirise the extravagances of Dick’s\nwritings, and to make certain suggestions which he had some diffidence\nin putting forward seriously. Whatever may have been his object, the\nwork, as a hit, was unrivalled. For months the press of America and\nEurope teemed with the subject; the account was printed and published\nin many languages and superbly illustrated. But, finally, Sir John\r\nHerschel’s signed denial gave the mad story its quietus.\n\n\n\n\nIX. THE CHEVALIER D’EON\n\n\nIn all the range of doubtful personalities there is hardly any one whom\nconvention has treated worse than it has the individual known in his\ntime--and after--as The Chevalier d’Eon. For about a hundred and fifty\nyears he has been written of--and spoken of for the first half century\nof that time--simply as a man who masqueraded in woman’s clothes. There\r\nseems to be just sufficient truth in this to save certain writers\non the subject from the charge of deliberate lying--a record which,\neven if it is to be posthumous, no man of integrity aims at; but it\nis abundantly evident that the rumour, which in time became a charge,\nwas originally set on foot deliberately by his political enemies, who\ntreated him and his memory without either consideration or even the\nelements of honourable truth. To begin with, here are the facts of his\nlong life.","Charles-Genevieve--Louis-Auguste-Andre--Timothée d’Eon de Beaumont was\nborn in 1728 in Tonnerre in Yonne, a department of France in the old\nprovince of Burgundy. His father, Louis d’Eon, was a parliamentary\nbarrister. As a youth he was so apt in his studies at the Collège\nMazarin that he received by special privilege his degree of Doctor in\nCanon and Civil Law before the age appointed for the conferring of such\r\nhonour, and was then enrolled in the list of parliamentary barristers\nin Paris. At first he had been uncertain which department of life he\nshould undertake. He swayed on one side towards the church, on the\nother towards the world of letters and _beaux-arts_. He was by habit\nan athlete, and was so good a swordsman that later on he had no rival\nin fencing except the Chevalier de Saint-George. In his twenty-fifth\nyear he published two remarkable books. One was on the political\r\nadministration of ancient and modern people, and the other on Phases\nof Finance in France at different times. (The latter was afterwards\npublished in German at Berlin in 1774, and so impressed the then King\nof Prussia that he gave orders that its ideas were to be carried into\npractical effect.)\n\n[Illustration: THE CHEVALIER D’EON]\n\nIn 1755 the Prince de Conti, to whose notice the Chevalier had been\nbrought by the above books, asked the king (Louis XV) to send him to\r\nRussia on a secret mission with the Chevalier Douglas; and from that\ntime till the king’s death in 1774 he was his trusted, loyal agent\nand correspondent. D’Eon’s special mission was to bring the courts\nof France and Russia closer than had been their wont, and also to\nobtain for the Prince de Conti, who was seeking the Dukedom of Finland\nand the Kingship of Poland, the favour of the Empress Elizabeth--a\ndifficult task, which had already cost M. de Valcroissant a spell\r\nof imprisonment. In order to accomplish his mission, d’Eon disguised\nhimself as a woman, and in this guise he was able to creep into the\ngood graces of the Empress. He became her “reader” and was thus enabled\nto prepare her for the reception of the secret purposes of his king.\nIn the following year he returned to France whence he was immediately\nsent again to St. Petersburg with the title of Secretary of Embassy.","But this time he went in his man’s clothes and as the brother of the\npretended female reader. By this time he had been made a lieutenant of\ndragoons. He came in spite of the Russian Chancellor Bestuchéf, who\nsaw in the young soldier-diplomat “_un subject dangereux et capable de\nboulverser l’empire_.” This time his real mission was to destroy in\nthe mind of the Empress faith in Bestuchéf, who was trying to hold the\nRussian army inactive and so deprive France of the advantages of the\r\nTreaty of Versailles. This he did so well that he was in a position to\nprove to the Empress that her chancellor had betrayed her interests.\nBestuchéf was arrested and his post conferred on Count Woronzow,\nwhose attitude was altogether favourable to France. The gratitude of\nKing Louis was shewn by his making d’Eon a captain of dragoons and\nconferring on him a pension of 2400 livres; he was also made censor of\nhistory and literature. D’Eon threw himself with his accustomed zeal\r\ninto the service of the army and distinguished himself by his courage\nin the battles of Hoecht; of Ultrop, where he was wounded; of Eimbech\nwhere he put the Scotch to flight; and of Osterkirk, where at the head\nof 80 dragoons and 20 hussars he overthrew a battalion of the enemy.\n\nNo better conventional proof of the accepted idea of d’Eon’s military\nworthiness can be given than the frequency and importance of the\noccasions on which he was honoured by the carrying of despatches. He\r\nbrought news of his successful negotiations for the peace of Versailles\nfrom Vienna in 1757. He was also sent with the Ratification of the\nTreaty. He carried the despatches of the great victory of the troops of\nMaria Theresa, forestalling the Austrian courier by a day and a half,\nalthough he had a broken leg.\n\nWhen next sent to Russia, d’Eon was sent as minister plenipotentiary,\nan office which he held up to 1762 when to the regret of the Empress\r\nhe was recalled. When he was leaving, Woronzow, the successor of\nBestuchéf, said to him, “I am sorry you are going, although your first\njourney with Chevalier Douglas cost my sovereign 250,000 men and more\nthan 5,000,000 roubles.” D’Eon answered: “Your excellency ought to\nbe happy that your sovereign and his minister have gained more glory\nand reputation than any others in the world.” On his return d’Eon\nwas appointed to the regiment d’Autchamp and gazetted as adjutant to","Marshal de Broglie. Then he was sent to Russia for the fourth time\nas minister plenipotentiary in place of Baron de Breuteuil. But Peter\nIII was dethroned, so the out-going Ambassador remained in Russia,\nand d’Eon went to England as secretary to the Embassy of the Duke de\nNivernais in 1762.\n\nAfter the Peace of 1763 d’Eon was chosen by the King of England to\ncarry the despatches. He received for this office the Star of St. Louis\nfrom the breast of the king, who on giving it said it was for the\r\nbravery which he had displayed as a soldier, and for the intelligence\nwhich he had shown in the negotiations between London and St.\nPetersburg.\n\nAt this time all went well with him. But his good fortune was changed\nby the bitter intrigues of his enemies. He was devoted to the king,\nbut had, almost as a direct consequence, the enmity of the courtesans\nwho surrounded him and wished for the opportunity of plucking him\nat their leisure. He had an astonishing knowledge on all matters of\r\nfinance, and apprised the king privately of secret matters which his\nministers tried to hide from him. The Court had wind of that direct\ncorrespondence with his majesty and therewith things were so managed\nthat the diplomatist got into trouble. Madame de Pompadour surprised\nthe direct correspondence between the king and d’Eon, with the result\nthat the latter was persecuted by the jealous courtiers who intrigued,\r\nuntil in 1765 he was replaced at the Embassy of London by the Count de\nGuerchy and he himself became the mark for all sorts of vexations and\npersecutions. His deadly enemy, the Count de Guerchy, tried to have\nhim poisoned, but the attempt failed. D’Eon took legal steps to punish\nthe attempt; but every form of pressure was used to keep the case out\nof Court. An attempt was made to get the Attorney General to enter a\n_nolle prosequi_; but he refused to lend himself to the scheme, and\r\nsent the matter to the Court of King’s Bench. There, despite all the\ndifficulties of furthering such a charge against any one so protected\nas an ambassador, it was declared on trial that the accused was guilty\nof the crime charged against him. De Guerchy accordingly had to return\nto France; but d’Eon remained in England, though without employment. To\nconsole him King Louis gave him in 1766 a pension of 12,000 livres, and\nassured him that though he was ostensibly exiled this was done to cover","up the protection extended to him. D’Eon, according to the report of\nthe time, was offered a bribe of 1,200,000 livres, to give up certain\nstate papers then in his custody; but to his honour he refused. Be the\nstory as it may, d’Eon up to the time of the death of Louis (1774)\ncontinued to be in London the real representative of France, though\nwithout any formal appointment.\n\nDuring this time one of the means employed with success by his enemies\r\nto injure the reputation of d’Eon, was to point out that he had passed\nhimself as a woman; the disguise he wore on his first visit to Russia.\nHis clean shaven face, his personal niceties, the correctness of his\nlife, all came to the aid of that supposition. In England bets were\nmade and sporting companies formed for the purpose of verifying his\nsex. Designs were framed for the purpose of carrying him off in order\nto settle the vexed question by a personal examination. Some of the\r\nefforts he had to repel by violence. In 1770 and in 1772 his friends\ntried to arrange that he should be allowed to return to France; but he\nrefused all offers as the Ministers insisted on making it a condition\nof his return that he should wear feminine apparel. After the accession\nof Louis XVI he obtained leave to return, free from the embarrassing\nrestraint hitherto demanded. As he was overwhelmed with debts he placed\r\nas a guarantee in the hands of Lord Ferrers an iron casket containing\nimportant French state papers. The minister sent Beaumarcheus to redeem\nthem, and in 1771 the Chevalier returned to France. He presented\nhimself at Versailles in his full uniform of a captain of dragoons. The\nQueen (Marie Antoinette) however, wished to see him presented in female\ndress; so the Minister implored him to meet her wishes. He consented;\r\nand thenceforward not only wore women’s clothes but called himself “La\nChevalière d’Eon.” In a letter addressed by him to Madame de Staël\nduring the French revolution he spoke of himself as “citizeness of the\nNew Republic of France, and of the old Republic of Literature.” On 2nd\nSeptember, 1777 he wrote to the Count de Maurepas, “Although I detest\nchanges of costume, yet they are hard at work at Mademoiselle Bertin’s\non my future and doleful dress, which however I shall cut in pieces at","the first sound of the cannon shots.” As a matter of fact when war with\nEngland became imminent he demanded to be allowed to take in the army\nthe position which he had won by bravery and as the price of honourable\nwounds. The only reply he got was his immurement for two months in the\nCastle of Dijon. In 1784 he returned to England, which he never again\nleft. In vain he appealed to the Convention and then to the First\nConsul to be allowed to place his sword at the service of his country;\r\nbut his prayer was not listened to. Used to the practice of the sword,\nhis circumstances being desperate, he then found in it a source of\nincome. He gave in public, assaults-at-arms with the Chevalier de\nSaint-George, one of the most notable fencers of his time. At length he\nwas given a small pension, £40, by George III, on which he subsisted\nduring the remainder of his life. He died 23rd May, 1810.\n\nIn very fact Chevalier d’Eon is historically a much injured man. His\r\nvocation was that of a secret-service agent of a nation surrounded with\nenemies, and to her advantage he used his rare powers of mind and body.\nHe was a very gallant soldier, who won distinction in the field and\nwas wounded several times; and in his endurance and his indifference\nto pain whilst carrying despatches of overwhelming importance he set\nan example that any soldier might follow with renown. As a statesman\nand diplomatist, and by the use of his faculties of inductive\r\nratiocination, he averted great dangers from his country. If there were\nnothing else to his credit he might well stand forth as a diplomatist\nwho had by his own exertions overthrown a dishonest Russian Chancellor\nand an unscrupulous French Ambassador. Of course, as he was an agent of\nsecret service, he had cognisance of much political and international\nscheming which he had at times to frustrate at the risk of all which he\r\nheld dear. But, considering the time he lived in, and the dangers which\nhe was always in the thick of, in a survey of his life the only thing\na reader can find fault with is his yielding to the base idea of the\nflighty-minded Marie Antoinette. What, to this irresponsible butterfly\nof fashion, was the honour of a brave soldier or the reputation of an\nacute diplomatist who had deserved well of his country. Of course to\nher any such foolery as that to which she condemned d’Eon was but the","fancy of an idle moment. But then the fancies of queens at idle moments\nmay be altogether destructive to someone. That they may be destructive\nto themselves is shown in the record of the terrible atrocities of the\nRevolution which followed hard on the luxurious masquerades of Trianon\nand Versailles. Even to the Queen of France, the Chevalier d’Eon\nshould have been something of a guarded, if not an honoured, person. He\r\nwas altogether a “king’s man.” He had been for many years the trusted\nand loyal servant of more than one king; and from the king’s immediate\ncircle the proper consideration should have been shown.\n\nThere is something pitiful in the spectacle of this old gentleman of\nnearly eighty years of age, who had in his time done so much, being\ncompelled to earn a bare livelihood by the exploitation of the most\nsordid page in his history--a page turned more than half a century\r\nbefore, and then only turned at all in response to the call of public\nduty.\n\nIn his retirement d’Eon showed more of his real nature than had been\npossible to him in the strenuous days when he had to be always vigilant\nand ready at an instant’s notice to conceal his intentions--his very\nthoughts. Here he showed a sensitiveness with which even his friends\ndid not credit him. He had been so long silent as to matters of his\nown concern that they had begun to think he had lost the faculty not\r\nonly of making the thought known, but even of the thought itself. The\nfollowing paragraph from the London _Public Advertiser_ of Wednesday,\n16th November, 1774, shows more of the real man than may be found in\nany of his business letters or diplomatic reports:--\n\n“The Chevalier d’Eon with justice complains of our public prints; they\nare eternally sending him to France while he is in body and soul fixed\nin this country; they have lately confined him in the Bastille, when he\r\nfled to England as a country of liberty; and they lately made a Woman\nof him, when not one of his enemies dared to put his manhood to the\nproof. He makes no complaints of the English Ladies.”\n\nIn an issue of the same paper 9th November, of the same year, it is\nmentioned that the Rt. Hon. Lord Ferrars, Sir John Fielding, Messrs.\nAddington, Wright and other worthy magistrates and gentlemen and\ntheir ladies did the Chevalier d’Eon the honour to dine with him in","Brewer St., Golden Square (common proof that the Chevalier d’Eon is\nnot confined in the Bastille). D’Eon was much too wily and too much\naccustomed to attack to allow diplomatic insinuations to pass unheeded.\nHe was now beginning to apply his garnered experience to his own\nprotection.\n\nFrom the above extract of 16th November one can note how the allegation\nas to his sex was beginning to rankle in the soldier’s mind, and how\r\nan open threat of punishment is conveyed in diplomatic form. Indeed\nhe had reason to take umbrage at the insinuation. More than once had\nattempts been made to carry him off for the purpose of settling bets\nby a humiliating personal scrutiny. From something of the same cause\nhis friends on his death caused an autopsy to be made before several\nwitnesses of position and repute. Amongst these were several surgeons\nincluding Père Elisée, First Surgeon to Louis XVIII. The medical\r\ncertificate ran as follows:\n\n“Je certifie, par le présent, avoir inspecté le corps du chevalier\nd’Eon, en présénce de M. Adair, M. Wilson et du Père Elysée, et avoir\ntrouvé les organs masculins parfaitement formés.”\n\n\n\n\nX. THE BISLEY BOY\n\n\nA. PROLEGOMENON\n\nQueen Elizabeth, the last of the House of Tudor, died unmarried. Since\nher death in 1603, there have been revolutions in England due to\nvarying causes, but all more or less disruptive of family memories.\r\nThe son of James I had his head cut off, and after the Commonwealth\nwhich followed, Charles I’s son James II, had to quit on the coming of\nWilliam III, by invitation. After William’s death without issue, Anne,\ndaughter of James II, reigned for a dozen years, and was succeeded\nby George I, descended through the female line from James I. His\ndescendants still sit on the throne of England.\n\n\nNO DESCENDANTS\n\nThe above facts are given not merely in the way of historical\r\nenlightenment but rather as a sort of apologetic prolegomenon to the\nethical consideration of the matter immediately before us. Had Queen\nElizabeth had any descendants, they need not have feared any discussion\nof her claims of descent. The issue of the legality of her mother’s\nmarriage had been tried exhaustively both before and after her own\nbirth, and she held the sceptre both by the will of her dead father","and the consent of her dead half-sister who left no issue. But Queen\nElizabeth, whatever her origin, would have been a sufficient ancestor\nfor any King or any Dynasty. Still, had she left issue there might\nhave been lesser people, descendants, whose feelings in the matter of\npersonal and family pride would have required consideration; and no\nperson entering on an analysis of historical fact would have felt quite\nfree-handed in such an investigation.\n\n\nB. THE QUEEN’S SECRET\r\nThere are quite sufficient indications throughout the early life of\nQueen Elizabeth that there was _some_ secret which she kept religiously\nguarded. Various historians of the time have referred to it, and now\nand again in a way which is enlightening.\n\nIn a letter to the Protector Somerset in 1549, when the Princess\nElizabeth was 15, Sir Robert Tyrwhitt says:\n\n    “I do verily believe that there hath been some secret promise\n    between my Lady, Mistress Ashley, and the Cofferer” [Sir Thomas\r\nParry] “never to confess to death, and if it be so, it will never\n    be gotten of her, unless by the King’s Majesty or else by your\n    Grace.”\n\nIn his _Girlhood of Queen Elizabeth_ Mr. Frank A. Mumby writes of\nthis:--\n\n    “Elizabeth was as loyal to Parry as to Mrs. Ashley; she\n    reinstated him after a year’s interval, in his office as\n    Cofferer, and on her accession to the throne she appointed\n    him Controller of the royal household. She continued to confer\r\npreferment upon both Parry and his daughter to the end of their\n    lives--“conduct,” remarks Miss Strickland, “which naturally\n    induces a suspicion that secrets of great moment had been\n    confided to him--secrets that probably would have touched not\n    only the maiden name of his royal Mistress, but placed her life\n    in jeopardy, and that he had preserved these inviolate. The same\n    may be supposed with respect to Mrs. Ashley, to whom Elizabeth\r\nclung with unshaken tenacity through every storm.”\n\nMajor Martin Hume in his _Courtships of Queen Elizabeth_ says of the\nfavourable treatment of the Governess and the Cofferer:--\n\n    “The confessions of Ashley and Parry are bad enough; but they\n    probably kept back more than they told, for on Elizabeth’s\n    accession and for the rest of their lives, they were treated\n    with marked favour. Parry was knighted and made Treasurer of the","Household, and on Mrs. Ashley’s death in July 1565 the Queen\n    visited her in person and mourned her with great grief.”\n\nThe same writer says elsewhere in the book:\n\n    “Lady Harrington and Mrs. Ashley were, in fact, the only ladies\n    about the Queen who were absolutely in her confidence.”\n\nIn a letter to the Doge of Venice in 1556 Giovanni Michiel wrote:\n\n    “She” [Elizabeth] “I understand, having plainly said that she\r\nwill not marry, even were they to give her the King’s” [Philip of\n    Spain] “son” [Don Carlos, Philip’s son by his first wife] “or\n    find any other great prince, I again respectfully remind your\n    serenity to enjoin secrecy about this.”\n\nCount de Feria wrote in April, 1559:\n\n    “If my spies do not lie, which I believe they do not, for a\n    certain reason which they have recently given me, I understand\n    that she [Elizabeth] will not bear children.”\r\nAt this time Elizabeth was only 26 years of age.\n\nThe following extract is taken from Mr. Mumby’s _Girlhood of Queen\nElizabeth_ in which is given the translation taken from Leti’s _La Vie\nd’Elizabeth_. The letter is from Princess Elizabeth to Lord Admiral\nSeymour, 1548 (_apropos_ of his intentions regarding her):--\n\n    “It has also been said that I have only refused you because I\n    was thinking of some one else. I therefore entreat you, my lord,\r\nto set your mind at rest on this subject, and to be persuaded by\n    this declaration that up to this time I have not the slightest\n    intention of being married, and, that if ever I should think of\n    it (_which I do not believe is possible_) you would be the first\n    to whom I should make known my resolution.”\n\n\nC. BISLEY\n\nThe place known to the great public as Bisley is quite other than that\nunder present consideration. Bisley, the ground for rifle competitions,\r\nis in Surrey, thoughtfully placed in juxtaposition to an eminent\ncemetery. It bears every indication of newness-so far as any locality\nof old earth can be new.\n\nBut the other is the original place of the name, possessing a\nrecorded history which goes back many hundreds of years. It is in\nGloucestershire high up on the eastern side of the Cotswold Hills at\ntheir southern end where they rise above the Little Avon which runs","into the embouchure of the Severn to the Bristol Channel. The trace of\nRoman occupation is all over that part of England. When the pioneers\nof that strenuous nation made their essay on Britain they came with\nthe intention of staying; and to-day their splendid roads remain\nunsurpassed--almost unsurpassable. In this part of the West Country\nthere are several of them, of which the chief are Irmin (or Ermine)\nStreet, running from Southampton through Cirencester and Gloucester\r\nto Caerleon, and Ikenild Street running from Cirencester, entering\nGloucestershire at Eastleach. I am particular about these roads as we\nmay require to notice them carefully. There is really but one Bisley in\nthis part of the country, but the name is spelled so variously that the\nsimple phonetic spelling might well serve for a nucleating principle.\nIn all sorts of papers, from Acts of Parliament and Royal Charters\ndown to local deeds of tenancy, it is thus varied--Bisleigh, Bistlegh,\r\nByselegh, Bussely. In this part of the Cotswolds “Over” is a common\npart of a name which was formerly used as a prefix. Such is not always\nat once apparent for the modern cartographer seems to prefer the modern\nword “upper” as the prefix. Attention is merely called to it here as\nlater on we shall have to consider it more carefully.\n\nThe most interesting spot in the whole district is the house\n“Overcourt,” which was once the manor-house of Bisley. It stands close\r\nto Bisley church from the grave-yard of which it is only separated by a\nwicket-gate. The title-deeds of this house, which is now in possession\nof the Gordon family show that it was a part of the dower of Queen\nElizabeth. But the world went by it, and little by little the estate\nof which it was a portion changed hands; so that now the house remains\nalmost as an entity. Naturally enough, the young Princess Elizabeth\nlived there for a time; and one can still see the room she occupied. A","medium-sized room with mullioned windows, having small diamond-shaped\npanes set in lead after the pattern of the Tudor period. A great beam\nof oak, not exactly “trued” with the adze but following the natural\ntrend of the wood, crosses the ceiling. The window looks out on a\nlittle walled-in garden, one of the flower beds of which is set in an\nantique stone receptacle of oblong shape which presents something of\nthe appearance of a stone coffin of the earlier ages. Of this more anon.\r\nWhether at the time of the birth of Elizabeth the mansion of Overcourt\nwas itself in the King’s possession is a little difficult to fathom,\nfor, in the Confession of Thomas Parry written in 1549 concerning\na period a little earlier, it is said: “And I told her” [Princess\nElizabeth] “further how he” [Lord Admiral Thomas Seymour] “would have\nhad her to have lands in Gloucestershire called Bisley as in parcel of\nexchange, and in Wales.”\r\nIn addition to its natural desirability in the way of hygiene and\naltitude there seems to have been a wish on the part of family advisers\nof those having estates in the vicinity of this place, to enlarge\ntheir possessions. This was wise enough, for in the disturbed state of\naffairs which ushered in the Tudor Dynasty, and the effects of which\nstill continued, it was of distinct benefit to have communities here\nand there large enough for self protection. This idea held with many\r\nof the families as well as individuals whose names are associated\nwith Bisley. Henry VIII himself, as over-lord with ownership derived\nfrom the Norman Conquest, had feudal claims on the de Bohuns who\nrepresented all the local possessions of the Dukedom of Gloucester and\nthe Earldoms of Essex Hereford and Northampton. Also the greedy eyes of\ncertain strong men and families who had hopes that time and influence\nalready existing, might later on bring them benefit, were fixed on this\r\ndesirable spot. Thomas Seymour, the unscrupulous brother of the future\nLord Protector, was high in influence in the early days of the Princess\nElizabeth, and even then must have had ambitious designs of marrying\nher. On the death of Henry VIII he had, when Lord Sudeley, married the\nking’s widow within a few months of her widowhood, and received a\ngrant of the royal possession at Bisley which, on his attainder, passed","on to Sir Anthony Kingston, who doubtless had already marked it down as\nan objective of his cupidity.\n\nThe “Hundred of Bisley” was one of the seven of Cirencester which of\nold were farmed by the Abbey of Tewksbury. Its position was so full\nof possibilities of future development as to justify the acquisitive\nspirit of those who desired it. In its bounds were what is now the\ntown of Stroud, as well as a whole line of mills which had in early\r\ndays great effect as they were workable by both wind and water power,\nboth of which were to be had in profusion. This little remote hamlet\nhad a progressive industry of its own in the shape of a manufacture of\nwoollen cloths. It also represented dyeing in scarlet and was the place\nof origin of Giles Gobelin, a famous dyer who gave his name to the\nGobelin tapestry.\n\nOne other thing must be distinctly borne in mind regarding Bisley in\nthe first half of the sixteenth century; it was comparatively easy of\r\naccess from London for those who wished to go there. A line drawn on\nthe map will show that on the way as _points d’appui_, were Oxford\nand Cirencester, both of which were surrounded with good roads as\nbecame their importance as centres. This line seems very short for its\nimportance. To-day the journey is that of a morning; and even in the\ntime of Henry VIII when horse traction was the only kind available,\nthe points were not very distant as to time of traverse. To Henry, who\r\ncommanded everything and had a myriad agents eager to display their\nenergy in his service, all was simple; and when he went a-hunting\nin the forests which made a network far around Berkeley Castle his\nobjective could be easily won between breakfast and supper. There was\nnot any difficulty therefore, and not too much personal strain, when he\nchose to visit his little daughter even though at the start one should\nbe at Nether Lypiat and the other at Greenwich or Hatfield or Eltham.\r\nD. THE TRADITION\n\n_The Tradition_ is that the little Princess Elizabeth, during her\nchildhood, was sent away with her governess for change of air to Bisley\nwhere the strong sweet air of the Cotswold Hills would brace her up.\nThe healthy qualities of the place were known to her father and many\nothers of those around her. Whilst she was at Overcourt, word was sent\nto her governess that the King was coming to see his little daughter;","but shortly before the time fixed, and whilst his arrival was expected\nat any hour, a frightful catastrophe happened. The child, who had been\nailing in a new way, developed acute fever, and before steps could be\ntaken even to arrange for her proper attendance and nursing, she died.\nThe governess feared to tell her father--Henry VIII had the sort of\ntemper which did not make for the happiness of those around him. In her\ndespair she, having hidden the body, rushed off to the village to try\r\nto find some other child whose body could be substituted for that of\nthe dead princess so that the evil moment of disclosure of the sad fact\nmight be delayed till after His Majesty’s departure. But the population\nwas small and no girl child of any kind was available. The distracted\nwoman then tried to find a living girl child who could be passed off\nfor the princess, whose body could be hidden away for the time.\n\nThroughout the little village and its surroundings was to be found no\r\ngirl child of an age reasonably suitable for the purpose required. More\nthan ever distracted, for time was flying by, she determined to take\nthe greater risk of a boy substitute--if a boy could be found. Happily\nfor the poor woman’s safety, for her very life now hung in the balance,\nthis venture was easy enough to begin. There _was_ a boy available,\nand just such a boy as would suit the special purpose for which he was\r\nrequired--a boy well known to the governess, for the little Princess\nhad taken a fancy to him and had lately been accustomed to play with\nhim. Moreover, he was a pretty boy as might have been expected from\nthe circumstance of the little Lady Elizabeth having chosen him as her\nplaymate. He was close at hand and available. So he was clothed in the\ndress of the dead child, they being of about equal stature; and when\nthe King’s fore-rider appeared the poor overwrought governess was able\r\nto breathe freely.\n\nThe visit passed off successfully. Henry suspected nothing; as the\nwhole thing had happened so swiftly, there had been no antecedent\nanxiety. Elizabeth had been brought up in such dread of her father that\nhe had not, at the rare intervals of his seeing her, been accustomed to\nany affectionate effusiveness on her part; and in his hurried visit he\nhad no time for baseless conjecture.\n\nThen came the natural nemesis of such a deception. As the dead could","not be brought back to life, and as the imperious monarch, who bore\nno thwarting of his wishes, was under the impression that he could\ncount on his younger daughter as a pawn in the great game of political\nchess which he had entered on so deeply, those who by now must have\nbeen in the secret did not and could not dare to make disclosure.\nMoreover the difficulties and dangers to one and all involved would\nof necessity grow with each day that passed. Willy nilly they must go\r\non. Fortunately for the safety of their heads circumstances favoured\nthem. The secret was, up to now, hidden in a remote village high up\non the side of the Cotswold hills. Steep declivities guarded it from\ncasual intrusion, and there was no trade beyond that occasional traffic\nnecessary for a small agricultural community. The whole country as far\nas the eye could see was either royal domain or individual property\r\nowned or held by persons attached to the dynasty by blood or interest.\n\nFacilities of intercommunication were few and slow; and above all\nuncertain and therefore not to be relied on.\n\nThis then was the beginning of the tradition which has existed locally\never since. In such districts change is slow, and what has been may\nwell be taken, unless there be something to the contrary, for what\nis. The isolation of the hamlet in the Cotswolds where the little\r\nprincess lived for a time--and is supposed to have died--is almost best\nexemplified by the fact that though the momentous secret has existed\nfor between three and four centuries, no whisper of it has reached the\ngreat world without its confines. Not though the original subject of it\nwas the very centre of the wildest and longest battle which has ever\ntaken place since the world began--polemical, dynastic, educational,\ninternational, commercial. Anyone living in any town in our own age,\r\nwhere advance and expansiveness are matters of degree, not of fact, may\nfind it hard to believe that any such story, nebulous though it may be,\ncould exist unknown and unrecorded outside a place so tiny that its\nmost important details will not be found even on the ordnance map of an\ninch to the mile. But a visit to Bisley will set aside any such doubts.\nThe place itself has hardly changed, in any measure to be apparent as","a change, in the three centuries and more. The same buildings stand as\nof yore; the same estate wall, though more picturesque with lichen, and\nwith individual stones corrugated by weather and dislocated by arboreal\ngrowths, speak of an epoch ending with the Tudor age. The doors of\nthe great tithe-barns which remain as souvenirs of extinct feudalism,\nstill yawn wide on their festered hinges. Nay, even the very trees show\namongst their ranks an extraordinary percentage of giants which have\r\nwithstood unimpaired all the changes that have been.\n\nLeaving busy and thriving Stroud, one climbs the long hill past Lipiat\nand emerges in the village, where time has suddenly ceased, and we\nfind ourselves in the age and the surroundings which saw the House of\nYork fade into the Tudor dynasty. Such a journey is almost a necessity\nfor a proper understanding of the story of the Bisley Boy, which has\nby the effluxion of time attained to almost the grace and strength\r\nof a legend. It is quite possible that though the place has stood\nstill, the tradition has not, for it is in the nature of intellectual\ngrowth to advance. One must not look on the Gloucestershire people\nas sleepy--sleepiness is no characteristic of that breezy upland;\nbut dreaming, whether its results be true or false, does not depend\non sleep. In cases like the present, sleep is not to be looked on as\na blood relation of death but rather as a preservative against the\r\nravages of time--like the mysterious slumber of King Arthur and others\nwho are destined for renewal.\n\nIt may be taken for granted that in course of time and under the\nprocess of purely oral communication, the story told in whispers lost\nnothing in the way of romance or credibility; that flaws or lacunæ\nwere made good by inquiry; and that recollections of overlooked or\nforgotten facts were recalled or even supplemented by facile invention.\r\nBut it may also be taken for granted that no statement devoid of a\nsolid foundation could become permanently accepted. There were too\nmany critics around, with memories unimpaired by overwork, to allow\nincorrect statements to pass unchallenged. There is always this in\ntradition, that the collective mind which rules in small communities is\na child’s mind, which must ever hold grimly on to fact. And that behind\nthe child’s mind is the child’s nature which most delights in the","recountal of what it knows, and is jealous of any addition to the story\nwhich is a part of its being.\n\nMajor Martin Hume writes in his _Courtships of Queen Elizabeth_:\n\n    “Elizabeth was only three when her mother’s fall removed her from\n    the line of the succession.... In 1542, however, the death of\n    James V of Scotland and the simultaneous birth of his daughter\n    Mary seemed to bring nearer Henry’s idea of a union between the\r\ntwo crowns. He proposed to marry the baby Queen of Scots to his\n    infant son and at the same time he offered the hand of Elizabeth\n    (then nine) to a son of Arran--head of House of Hamilton, next\n    heir to the Scottish crown.... Mary and Elizabeth were restored\n    to their places in the line of succession.... In January 1547\n    Henry VIII died, leaving the succession to his two daughters\n    in tail after Edward VI and his heirs. Queen Catherine (Parr)\r\nimmediately married Sir Thomas Seymour, brother of Protector\n    Somerset and uncle of the little king (Edward VI). To them was\n    confided Princess Elizabeth then a girl of 14.”\n\nElizabeth was three in 1536. The story of the Bisley Boy dates probably\nto 1543-4. So that if the story have any foundation at all in fact,\nsigns of a complete change of identity in the person of Princess\nElizabeth must be looked for in the period of some seven or eight years\r\nwhich intervened.\n\n\nE. THE DIFFICULTY OF PROOF\n\nIn such a case as that before us the difficulty of proof is almost\ninsuperable. But fortunately we are dealing with a point not of law\nbut of history. Proof is not in the first instance required, but only\nsurmise, to be followed by an argument of probability. Such records as\nstill exist are all the proofs that can be adduced; and all we can do\nis to search for such records as still exist, without which we lack\r\nthe enlightenment that waits on discovery. In the meanwhile we can\ndeduce a just conclusion from such materials as we do possess. Failing\ncertitude, which is under the circumstances almost impossible, we only\narrive at probability; and with that until discovery of more reliable\nmaterial we must be content.\n\nLet us therefore sum up: first the difficulties of the task before us;\nthen the enlightenments. “Facts,” says one of the characters of Charles","Dickens, “bein’ stubborn and not easy drove,” are at least, so far as\nthey go, available. We are free to come to conclusions and to make\ncritical comments. Our risk is that if we err--on whichever side does\nnot matter--we reverse our position and become ourselves the objects of\nattack.\n\nOur main difficulties are two. First, that all from whom knowledge\nmight have been obtained are dead and their lips are closed; second,\nthat records are incomplete. This latter is the result of one of two\r\ncauses--natural decay or purposed obliteration. The tradition of the\nBisley Boy has several addenda due to time and thought. One of these is\nthat some of those concerned in the story disappeared from the scene.\n\nThe story runs that on Elizabeth’s accession or under circumstances\nantecedent to it all who were in the secret and still remained were\n“got rid of.” The phrase is a convenient one and not unknown in\nhistory. Fortunately those who _must_ have been in such a secret--if\r\nthere was one--were but few. If such a thing occurred in reality, four\npersons were necessarily involved in addition to Elizabeth herself:\n(1) Mrs. Ashley, (2) Thomas Parry, (3) the parent of the living child\nwho replaced the dead one; the fourth, being an unknown quantity,\nrepresents an idea rather than a person--a nucleated identity typical\nof family life with attendant difficulties of concealment. Of these\nfour--three real persons and an idea--three are accounted for, so far\r\nas the “got rid of” theory is concerned. Elizabeth never told; Thomas\nParry and Mrs. Ashley remained silent, in the full confidence of the\n(supposed) Princess who later was Queen. With regard to the last, the\nnucleated personality which includes the unknown parent possibly but\nnot of certainty, contemporary record is silent; and we can only regard\nhim or her as a mysterious entity available for conjecture in such\ncases of difficulty as may present themselves.","We must perforce, therefore, fall back on pure unadulterated\nprobability, based on such rags of fact as can be produced at our\ninquest. Our comfort--content being an impossibility--must lie in the\ngenerally-accepted aphorism; “Truth will prevail.” In real life it is\nnot always so; but it is a comforting belief and may remain _faut de\nmieux_.\n\nA grave cause of misleading is inexact translation--whether the fault\nbe in ignorance or intentional additions to or substractions from\r\ntext referred to. A case in point is afforded by the letter already\nreferred to from Leti’s _La Vie d’Elizabeth_. In the portion quoted\nElizabeth mentioned her intention of not marrying: “I have not the\nslightest intention of being married, and ... if ever I should think\nof it (_which I do not believe is possible_).” Now in Mr. Mumby’s book\nthe quotation is made from Leti’s _La Vie d’Elizabeth_ which is the\ntranslation into French from the original Italian, the passage marked\r\nabove in italics is simply: “ce que je ne crois pas.” The addition of\nthe words “is possible” gives what is under the circumstances quite\na different meaning to the earliest record we have concerning the\nvery point we are investigating. When I began this investigation, I\nlooked on the passage--neither Mumby, remember, nor even Leti, but\nwhat professed to be the _ipsissima verba_ of Elizabeth herself--and\nI was entirely misled until I had made comparison for myself--_Quis\r\ncustodiet ipsos custodes?_ The addition of the two words, which seems\nat first glance merely to emphasise an expression of opinion, changes\nthe meaning of the writer to a belief so strong that the recital of it\ngives it the weight of intention. Under ordinary circumstances this\nwould not matter much; but as we have to consider it in the light of\na man defending his head against danger, and in a case where absolute\r\ncircumspection is a necessary condition of safety so that intention\nbecomes a paramount force, exactness of expression is all-important.\n\nThe only way to arrive at probability is to begin with fact. Such is\na base for even credulity or its opposite, and if it is our wish or\nintention to be just there need be no straining on either one side or\nthe other. In the case of the Bisley Boy the points to be considered\nare:\n\n1. The time at which the change was or could be affected.","2. The risk of discovery, (a) at first, (b) afterwards.\n\nIt will be necessary to consider these separately for manifest reasons.\nThe first belongs to the region of Danger; the second to the region\nof Difficulty, with the headsman’s axe glittering ominously in the\nbackground.\n\n\nF. THE TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY\n\n(_a_) _The time at which the change was or could have been effected._\n\nFor several valid reasons I have come to the conclusion that the\r\ncrucial period by which the Bisley story must be tested is the year\nending with July 1544. No other time either earlier or later would, so\nfar as we know, have fulfilled the necessary conditions.\n\nFirst of all the question of sex has to be considered; and it is herein\nthat, lacking suitable and full opportunity, discovery of such an\nimposture must have been at once detected--certainly had it commenced\nat an early age. In babyhood the whole of the discipline of child-life\r\nbegins. The ordinary cleanliness of life has to be taught, and to this\nend there is no portion of the infantile body which is not subject to\nat least occasional inspection. This disciplinary inspection lasts\nby force of habit until another stage on the journey towards puberty\nhas been reached. Commercial use in America fixes stages of incipient\nwomanhood--by dry goods’ advertisement--as “children’s, misses’ and\ngirls’ clothing,” and the illustration will sufficiently serve. It\r\nseems at first glance an almost unnecessary intrusion into purely\ndomestic life; but the present is just one of those cases where the\nexperience of women is not only useful but necessary. In a question\nof identity of sex the nursemaid and the washerwoman play useful\nparts in the witness box. Regarding Elizabeth’s childhood no question\nneed ever or can ever arise. For at least the first ten years of her\nlife, a woman’s sex _need_ not be known outside the nursery and the\r\nsick room; but then this is the very time when her attendants have\ndirect and ample knowledge. Moreover in the case of the child of Queen\nAnne (Boleyn) there was every reason why the sex should have been\nunreservedly known. Henry VIII divorced Katherine of Aragon and married\nAnne in the hope of having legitimate male issue to sit on the throne\nof England. Later, when both Katherine and Anne had failed to satisfy\nhim as to male issue, he divorced Anne and married Jane Seymour for","the same purpose. In the interval either his views had enlarged or\nhis patience had extended; for, when Jane’s life hung in the balance,\nowing to an operation which the surgeons considered necessary, and the\nhusband was consulted as to which life they should, in case of needful\nchoice, try to save, his reply was peculiar--though, taken in the light\nof historical perspective, not at variance with his dominating idea.\r\nGregorio Leti thus describes the incident (the quotation is made from\nthe translation of the Italian into French and published in Amsterdam\nin 1694):--\n\n    “Quand les médécins demandèrent au Roi qui l’on sauverait de\n    la mère ou de l’enfant, il répondit, qu’il auroit extremement\n    souhait de pouvoir sauver la mère et l’enfant, mais que cel\n    n’étant possible, il vouloit que l’on sauvat l’enfant plutôt que\n    la mère parce qu’il trouveroit assez d’autres femmes.”\r\nIt had become a monomania with Henry that he should be father of a\nlawful son; and when the child of his second union was expected, he\nso took the consummation of his wishes for granted that those in\nattendance on his wife were actually afraid to tell him the truth. It\nwould have been fortune and social honour to whosoever should bear\nhim the glad tidings. We may be sure then that news so welcome would\nnever have been perverted by those who had so much to gain. As it was,\r\nthe “lady-mistress”--as she called herself--of the little Princess,\nMrs. (afterwards Lady) Bryan, wrote in her letter to Lord Cromwell in\n1536--Elizabeth being then in her third year:--\n\n    “She is as toward a child and as gentle of conditions, as ever I\n    knew any in my life.”\n\nThe writer could have had no ignorance as to the sex of the child, for\nin the same letter she gives Cromwell a list of her wants in the way\r\nof clothing; which list is of the most intimate kind, including gown,\nkirtle, petticoat, “no manner of linen nor smocks,” kerchiefs, rails,\nbody stitchets, handkerchiefs, sleeves, mufflers, biggens. As in the\nsame letter it is mentioned that the women attending the child were\nunder the rule of Lady Bryan--an accomplished nurse who had brought up\nPrincess Mary and had been “governess to the children his Grace have\nhad ever since”--it can be easily understood she was well acquainted","with even the smallest detail of the royal nursery. Had the trouble of\nthe lady-mistress been with regard to superabundance of underclothing,\none might have understood ignorance on the part of the responsible\ncontroller; but in the plentiful lack of almost every garment necessary\nfor the child’s wear by day or by night there could be no question as\nto her ostensible sex at this age.\n\nThence on, there were experienced and devoted persons round the little\r\nPrincess, whose value in her father’s eyes was largely enhanced since\nhe had secured, for the time, her legitimacy by an Act of Parliament.\n\nAfter Elizabeth had been legitimised, she became one of the pieces in\nthe gigantic game of chess on which Henry had embarked. Despite the\nfact that the son for whom he had craved was now a boy of six, it was\nonly wise to consider and be prepared for whatever might happen in case\nPrince Edward should not live, and if, in such a case, Mary should die\r\nwithout issue. The case was one of amazing complexity, and as the time\nwore on the religious question became structurally involved. England\nhad declared in no uncertain voice in favour of Protestantism, and the\nwhole forces of Rome were arrayed against her. Mary was altogether in\nfavour of the religion of her injured mother, and behind her stood the\npower of Catholicism which, even in that unscrupulous age, was well\r\nahead in the race of unscrupulousness. And as Elizabeth stood next\nto the young Prince Edward in the forces of Reformation, on her was\nfocussed much of the suspicion of polemic intrigue. The papacy was all\npowerful in matters of secret inquiry. Indeed in such an inquest its\npowers were unique, for unscrupulous spies were everywhere--even, it\nwas alleged, in the confessional. How then could such a secret as the\nsex of a little girl of not a dozen years of age, who was constantly\r\nsurrounded by women necessarily conversant with every detail of her\nlife, be kept from all who wished to solve it. In such a state of\naffairs suspicion was equivalent to discovery. And discovery meant ruin\nto all concerned, death to abettors of the fraud, woe and destruction\nto England and a general upheaval of the fundamental ideas of\nChristendom. It may, I presume, be taken for granted without flaw or\nmitigation of any kind that up to July, 1543, the “Princess Elizabeth”","was what she appeared to be--a girl.\n\nAt the time of her first letter to the new Queen, Catherine (Parr), she\nwas just a trifle under ten years of age and a well-grown child, quick,\nclever, rather precocious, and well grounded in the learning of her\ntime. The exact date of this letter is not given by Leti--of which more\nanon--but it must have been somewhere between July 12 and 31, 1543.\nHenry VIII married Catherine Parr on 12 July, and in her letter of 1543\r\nElizabeth calls Catherine “your Majesty.” In her letter of 31 July,\n1544 she writes to the same correspondent:\n\n    “... has deprived me for a whole year of your most illustrious\n    presence.”\n\nThe whereabouts of Elizabeth during this last year appears to be the\ncentre of the mystery; and if any letter or proof is ever found of\nElizabeth’s being anywhere but in her own house of Overcourt in Bisley\nParish, it will go far to settle the vexed question now brought before\r\nthe world for the first time.\n\n\n(_b_) _The opportunity_\n\nThe year 1542 was a busy time for Henry VIII. He had on hand, either\npending or going on, two momentous wars, one with Scotland the other\nwith France. The causes of either of these were too complicated for\nmention here; suffice it to say that they were chiefly dynastic and\npolemic. In addition he was busy with matrimonial matters, chiefly\nkilling off his fifth wife Catherine Howard, and casting eyes on the\r\nnewmade widow of Lord Latimer. In 1543 he married the lady, as his\nsixth wife. She herself can hardly be said to have lacked matrimonial\nexperience, as this was her third union. Her first venture was with\nthe elderly Lord Borough, who, like Lord Latimer, left her wealthy.\nHenry had by now got what might be called in the slang of the time “the\nmarriage habit,” and honeymoon dalliance had hardly the same charm\nfor him as it usually is supposed to have with those blessed with a\r\nlesser succession of spouses. The consequence was that he was able to\ngive more attention to the necessary clearing up of the Scottish war,\nwhich finished at Solway Moss on December 14th, with the consequent\ndeath from chagrin of the Scottish King James V. The cause of the war,\nhowever, continued in the shape of a war with France which went on till\n1546 when peace was declared to the pecuniary benefit of the English\nKing. For the last two years of this time Henry carried on the war","singlehanded, as the Emperor Charles V, who had begun it as his ally,\nwithdrew.\n\nThere is a paragraph in Grafton’s _Chronicle_ published in 1569 which\nthrows a flood of light on Elizabeth’s absence at this time, 1543:\n“This yeare was in London a great death of the pestilence, and\ntherefore Mighelmas terme was adjourned to Saint Albones, and there it\nwas kept to the ende.”\n\nIn his _Girlhood of Queen Elizabeth_, Mr. Mumby says: “For some obscure\r\nreason Elizabeth seems to have fallen out of her father’s favour again\nvery soon after Catherine Parr had obtained his consent to her return\nto Court” (1543). No such cause for the removal of the Princess from\nLondon was necessary. It was probably to the presence of the pestilence\nin London that her removal to a remote and healthy place was due.\nFailing Prince Edward, then only five years of age and a weakly child,\nthe crown must--unless some constitutional revolution be effected in\r\nthe meantime or some future son be born to him--devolve on his female\nheirs, a matter pregnant with strife of unknown dimensions. Mary was\nnow twenty-seven years old and of a type that did not promise much for\nmaternity. At the same time, Mary, though his eldest living daughter,\nwas the hope of the Catholic party, to which he was in violent\nopposition; whereas in Elizabeth lay the hope of the whole of the party\nof the Reformation. Her life was to her father far beyond the calls of\r\nparental affection or dynastic ambition, and she had to be saved at all\ncosts from risk of health. Henry’s own experience of child-life was a\nbitter one. Of his five children by Catherine of Aragon only one, Mary,\nsurvived childhood. Elizabeth was the only survivor of Anne Boleyn;\nEdward, of Jane Seymour. Anne of Cleves had no children, and if report\nspoke truly no chance of having any. Catherine Howard was executed\r\nchildless. And he had only just married Catherine Parr, who had already\nhad two husbands.\n\nOn July 12, 1543, Henry married Catherine and in due course devoted\nhimself to the war. On the 14 July, 1544, he crossed from Dover to\nCalais to look after the conduct of affairs for himself, and on the\n26th began the siege of Boulogne. This lasted for two months when\nhaving reduced the city he returned home. On the 8 September he wrote\nto his wife to that effect. During his absence Queen Catherine was","vicegerent and had manifestly as much public work on hand as she\ncould cope with. Bisley was a long way from London, and there were no\norganised posts in the sixteenth century. Moreover, ever since his\nlast marriage, Henry had been an invalid. He was now fifty-two years\nof age, of unhealthy body, and so heavy that he had to be lifted\nby machinery. Catherine was a devoted wife; and as Henry was both\nviolent and irritable she had little time at command to give to the\r\naffairs of other people. There was small opportunity for any one then\nwho was sufficiently in the focus of affairs to be cognisant of such\nan imposture as the tradition points out. Doubtless hereafter, when\na story so fascinating and at first glance so incredible begins to\nbe examined and its details thoroughly threshed out, more items of\nevidence or surmise than are at present available will be found for\nthe settlement of the question, one way or the other. In the meantime,\r\nbe it remembered, that we are only examining offhand a tradition made\nknown for the first time after three centuries. Our present business is\nto consider _possibilities_. Later on the time may come--as it surely\nwill; if the story can in the least be accepted--for the consideration\nof _probabilities_. Both of these tentative examinations will lead to\nthe final examination of possibility, of probability, and of proof\r\n_pro_ or _contra_.\n\nAt this stage we must admit that neither time nor opportunity present\nany difficulty in itself insuperable.\n\n\nG. THE IDENTITY OF ELIZABETH\n\n(_a_) _Documents_\n\nThe next matter with which we have to deal is regarding the identity of\nElizabeth. This needs (if necessary) a consideration of the facts of\nher life, and so far as we can realise them, from external appearance,\nmental and moral attitudes, and intentions. On account of space we\r\nmust confine this branch of the subject to the smallest portion of\ntime necessary to form any sort of just conclusion and accepting the\navailable records up to 1543, take the next period from that time\nto anywhere within the first few years of her reign--by which time\nher character was finally fixed and the policy on which her place in\nhistory is to be judged had been formulated and tested.\n\nThis implies in the first instance a brief (very brief) study of her","physique with a corollary in the shape of a few remarks on her heredity:\n\n_Grafton’s Chronicle_ states, under the date of 7 September 1533,\n“the Queene was delivered of a fayre Lady” which was his Courtly way\nof announcing the birth of a female princess, blond in colour. In all\nchronicles “fayre” means of light colour. In Wintown the reputed father\nof Macbeth--the Devil--is spoken of as a “fayre” man; evil qualities\nwere in that age attributed to blondes.\r\nIn a letter dated from Greenwich Palace, 18 April, 1534, Sir\nWilliam Kingston said to Lord Lisle: “To-day, the King and Queen\nwere at Eltham” (where the royal nursery then was) “and saw my Lady\nPrincess--as goodly a child as hath been seen. Her Grace is much in the\nKing’s favour as a goodly child should be--God save her!”\n\nIn 1536, when Elizabeth was but three years old, Lady Bryan, the\n“Lady-mistress” of both Mary and her half-sister, wrote from Hunsdon\r\nto Lord Cromwell regarding the baby princess. “For she is as toward\na child and as gentle of conditions, as ever I knew any in my life.\nJesus preserve her Grace!” In the same letter she says “Mr. Shelton\nwould have my Lady Elizabeth to dine and sup every day at the board\nof estate. Alas! my Lord it is not meet for a child of her age to keep\nsuch rule yet. I promise you, my lord, I dare not take it upon me to\r\nkeep her Grace in health an’ she keep that rule. For there she shall\nsee divers meats, and fruits, and wines, which it would be hard for\nme to restrain her Grace from. Ye know, my lord, there is no place of\ncorrection there; and she is yet too young to correct greatly.”\n\nTestimony is borne according to Leti to the good qualities of the\nPrincess Elizabeth in these early years, by the affectionate regard in\nwhich she was held by two of Henry’s queens, the wronged and unhappy\r\nAnne of Cleves and the happy-natured Catherine Parr. Anne, he says,\nthough she had only seen her twice loved her much; she thought her\nbeautiful and full of spirit (“pleine d’esprit.”) Catherine, according\nto the same writer who had seen her often before her marriage to Henry,\nadmired her “esprit et ses manières.”\n\nIf Leti could only have spoken at first hand, his record of her would\nbe very valuable. But unhappily he was only born nearly thirty years","after her death. His history was manifestly written from records and as\nElizabeth’s fame was already made before he began to treat of her his\nwork is largely a panegyric of hearsay. There is, regarding the youth\nof the Princess, such an overdone flood of adulation that it is out of\nplace in a serious history of a human life. In his account of the time\nwhich we are considering, we find the child compared in both matters\nof body and mind to an angel. She is credited at the age of ten with an\r\namount of knowledge in all branches of learning sufficient to equip the\nillustrious men of a century. The fact is the Italian has accepted the\nqueen’s great position, and then reconstructed her youth to accord with\nit, in such a way as to show that whatever remarkable abilities she\npossessed were the direct outcome of her own natural qualities.[2]\n\n    [2] Amongst other branches of knowledge he credits her with\n        knowing well “Geography, Cosmography, Mathematics,\r\nArchitecture, Painting, Arithmetic, History, Mechanics.” She\n        had a special facility in learning languages; spoke and wrote\n        French, Italian, Spanish, Flemish. She loved poetry and wrote\n        it, but regarded it as a useless amusement and, as it was\n        distasteful to her, turned to history and politics. Finally\n        he adds: “She was naturally ambitious and always knew how to\n        hide her defects.”\r\nThe details above given are not merely meagre but are only explicable\nby the fact that during the earlier years of her life the child\nwas not considered of any importance. The circumstances of Anne’s\nmarriage--which in any case was delayed till it became a necessary\npreliminary to the legitimacy on which any future claim to the throne\nmust rest--did not make for a belief in the public mind for its\npermanency. Things were fluctuating in the religious world and few\r\nwere inclined to the belief that the Pope (with whom lay the last\nword and whose political leanings in favour of Catherine of Aragon\nand the validity of her marriage to Henry were well known) would be\noverthrown by the English King. And in any case, were Henry to be the\nfinal judge of appeal in his own case no great continuity of purpose\ncould be expected from him. The first important event which we have\nto consider with reference to the question before us is Elizabeth’s","first letter to Queen Catherine (Parr) in 1543. In this the girl then\nten years old writes to her new step-mother, at whose marriage she\ntogether with her half-sister Mary had been present. It is in form a\ndutiful letter, not entirely without an apparent compulsion or at least\nintelligent supervision. As it stands, it is impossible to believe\nthat it emanated from a child of ten quite free to follow out its\ninclinations. The dutifulness is altogether, or largely, due to the\r\ntraining and self-suppression of the royal child of an arbitrary father\nwith absolute power. But it remains for each reader to consider it\nimpartially. The points which we should do well to note here are its\nplain form of expression, and its entire absence of personal affection.\nThe latter is all the more marked in that it was a letter of thanks for\na kindness conferred. Elizabeth was very anxious to come to her father,\nand Catherine had furthered her wish and secured its fulfilment. After\r\nthe marriage, the child, as is shown (or rather inferred), had been\nsent away for more than a year, which absence had been prolonged for at\nleast six months--as already shown.\n\nThere is little evidence of Elizabeth’s inner nature in these early\ndays; but we have every right to think that she was of a peaceable,\nkindly and affectionate nature. Lady Bryan her first nurse or governess\n(after Lady Boleyn, Anne’s mother) thought highly of her. Catherine\r\nAshley, who had charge of her next, loved her and was her devoted\nservant, friend and confidant till her death.\n\nThomas Parry her life-long friend was devoted to her, and when the\ncircumstances of their respective lives and the happenings of the time\nkept them apart, she restored him at the first opportunity and made his\nfortune her special care.\n\nThere is little base here on which to build an inverted pyramid; our\nonly safety is in taking things as they seem to be and using common\r\nsense.\n\n\n(_b_) _Changes_\n\nLet us now take the years beginning with 1544. From this time on, more\nis known of the personality of Elizabeth; in fact there is little\nunknown, that is, of matters of fact, and to this only we must devote\nourselves. Whatever may have been Elizabeth’s motives we can only infer\nthem. She was a secretive person and took few into her confidence,\nunless it was of vital necessity--and then only in matters required by","the circumstance. The earliest knowledge we have of this second period\nof her history is in her letter to Queen Catherine (Parr) written from\nSt. James’ Palace on 31 July, 1544.\n\nIn the year which had elapsed since her last recorded letter\nElizabeth’s literary style had entirely changed. The meagre grudging\nstyle has become elegant and even florid with the ornate grace and\nimagery afforded by the study of the Latin and French tongues.\nAltogether there is not merely a more accomplished diction but there\r\nis behind it a truer feeling and larger sympathy. It is more in accord\nwith the letter accompanying the gift to the Queen, of her translation\nof the _Mirror of the Sinful Soul_ which she had dedicated to her.\n\nHistorians have given various rescripts of certain earlier letters of\nthe Princess Elizabeth, but none of them seem in harmony of thought\nwith this, whereas it is quite in accord with her later writings.\nMetabolism is an accepted doctrine of physiology; but its scope is\r\nnot--as yet at all events--extended to the intellect, and we must take\nthings as we find them within the limits of human knowledge.\n\nIt will perhaps be as well to reserve the consideration of any other\npoint, except the change in actual identity, till the complete analogy\nof all natural processes is an established fact.\n\n\n(_c_) _Her personality_\n\nWe have no letters of Princess Elizabeth before 1543 which are not open\r\nto grave doubt as to date, but there is one letter to which allusion\nmust almost of necessity be made. It is a letter from Roger Ascham,\ntutor to the Princess Elizabeth, to Mrs. Ashley. No date is given\nby Mr. Mumby, but he states in his text that it was written “during\nGrindal’s term of office” as tutor to the Princess. Mumby quotes from\nthe _Elizabeth_ of Miss Strickland, who in turn quotes from Whittaker’s\n_Richmondshire_. Now Grindal’s term of office lasted from 1546\r\n(probably the end of that year) till it was cut short by his death from\nthe Plague in 1548, so that he could not have known his royal pupil\n_before_ 1544. The text of the letter leads a careful reader to infer\nthat it was written _after_ that date. The important part of the letter\nis as follows:\n\n    “... the thanks you have deserved from that noble imp by your\n    labour and wisdom now flourishing in all goodly godliness.... I\n    wish her Grace (Elizabeth) to come to that end in perfectness","and likelihood of her wit and painlessness in her study, true\n    trade of her teaching, which your diligent overseeing doth most\n    constantly promise.... I wish all increase of virtue and honour\n    to that my good lady, whose wit, good Mrs. Ashley, I beeseech\n    you somewhat favour. Blunt edges be dull and dure much pain to\n    little profit; the free edge is soon turned if it be not handled\n    thereafter. If you pour much drink at once into a goblet, the\r\nmost part will dash out and run over; if ye pour it softly you\n    may fill it even to the top, and so her Grace, I doubt not, by\n    little and little may be increased in learning, that at length\n    greater cannot be required.”\n\nIf this letter means anything at all--which in the case of such a man\nas Roger Ascham is not to be doubted--it means that Mrs. Ashley, then\nher governess, was cautioned not to press the little girl overmuch\r\nin her lessons. It is an acknowledgment of the teacher’s zeal as well\nas affection, and in the flowery and involved style of the period and\nthe man, illustrates the theory by pointing out the error of trying to\nfill a small vessel from a larger one by pouring too fast. She is not\na backward child, he says in effect, but go slowly with her education,\nyou cannot give full learning all at once.\n\nCompare this letter with that of the same writer to John Sturmius,\r\nRector of the Protestant University of Strasbourg, on the same subject\nin 1550:\n\n    “The Lady Elizabeth has accomplished her sixteenth year; and so\n    much of solidity of understanding, such courtesy united with\n    dignity, have never been observed at so early an age. She has\n    the most ardent love of true religion and of the best kind of\n    literature. The constitution of her mind is exempt from female\n    weakness, and she is endued with a masculine power of application.\r\n“No apprehension can be quicker than hers, no memory more\n    retentive. French and Italian she speaks like English; Latin with\n    fluency, propriety and judgment; she also spoke Greek with me,\n    frequently, willingly, and understanding well. Nothing can be\n    more elegant than her handwriting, whether in the Greek or Roman\n    character. In music she is very skilful but does not greatly\n    delight. With respect to personal decoration, she greatly prefers","a simple elegance to show and splendour, so despising the outward\n    adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold, that in\n    the whole manner of her life she rather resembles Hippolyta than\n    Phædra.”\n\nThat such a scholar as Roger Ascham makes the simile is marked.\nHippolyta was a Queen of the Amazons and Phædra was an almost\npreternaturally womanly woman, one with a tragic intensity of passion.\r\nThe Elizabeth whom we know from 1544 to 1603 certainly had brains\nenough to protect her neck. In 1549 Sir Robert Tyrwhitt wrote to the\nProtector Somerset, apropos of the strenuous effort being made to gain\nfrom her some admission damaging to herself concerning Thomas Seymour’s\nattempts to win her hand:\n\n“She hath a very pretty wit and nothing is gotten out of her but by\ngreat policy.”\n\nIn a letter from Simon Renard Ambassador to the Emperor Charles V dated\r\nLondon September 23, 1553, there is incidentally a statement regarding\nElizabeth’s character which it is wise to hold in mind when discussing\nthis particular period of her history. Writing of Elizabeth’s first\nattendance at Mass he said: “she, Mary, ... entreated Madame Elizabeth\nto speak freely of all that was on her conscience, to which the\nPrincess replied that she was resolved to declare publicly that in\ngoing to Mass as in all else that she had done, she had only obeyed the\r\nvoice of her conscience; and that she had acted freely, without fear,\ndeceit, or pretence. We have since been told, however, that the said\nLady Elizabeth is very timid, and that while she was speaking with the\nQueen she trembled very much.”\n\nCompare with this the letter of 16th March, 1554 to the Queen (Mary)\nwritten just as she was told to go to the Tower. In this letter which\nis beautifully written and with not a trace of agitation she protests\r\nher innocence of any plot. Her mental attitude was thoroughly borne\nout by a calm dignity of demeanour which is more in accord with male\nthan female nature. In very fact Elizabeth appears all her life since\n1544 to have been playing with great thoughtfulness and yet dexterity a\ndiplomatic game--acting with histrionic subtlety a part which she had\nchosen advisedly.\n\nA good idea of the personality of Elizabeth during the period beginning","with 1544 may be had from a brief consideration of the risks which a\nperson taking up such an imposture would run, first at the time of\nbeginning the venture and then of sustaining the undertaken rôle.\nAt the outset a boy of ten or eleven would not think of taking it\nseriously. At first he would look on it as a “lark” and carry out the\nidea with a serious energy only known in play-time. Later thought\nwould give it a new charm in the shape of danger. This, while adding\r\nto his great zest, would sober him; thence on it would be a game--just\nsuch a game as a boy loves, perpetual struggle to get the best of\nsomeone else. To some natures wit against wit is a better strife than\nstrength against strength, and if one were well equipped for such a\nfray the game would satisfy the ambition of his years. In any case when\nonce such a game was entered on, the stake would be his own head--a\nconsideration which must undoubtedly make for strenuous effort--even in\r\nboyhood.\n\nThe task which would have followed--which did follow if the Bisley\nstory is true--would have been vastly greater. If the imposture\nescaped immediate detection--which is easily conceivable--a new kind\nof endeavour would have been necessary; one demanding the utmost care\nand perpetual vigilance in addition to the personal qualities necessary\nfor the carrying out of the scheme. Little help could be given to the\nyoung boy on whom rested the weight of what must have appeared to all\r\nconcerned in it a stupendous undertaking. From the nature of the task,\nwhich was one which even the faintest breath of suspicion would have\nruined, the little band, originally involved, could gain no assistance.\nSafety was only possible by the maintenance of the most rigid secrecy.\nAll around them were enemies served by a host of zealous spies. If then\nthe story be true, those who carried such an enterprising situation\r\nto lasting success, must have been no common persons. Let us suppose\nfor a moment that the story was true. In such case the Boy of Bisley\nwho acted the part of the Princess Elizabeth could have had only two\nassistants--assistants even if they were only passive. _Whatever_ may\nhave happened we know from history that both Mrs. Ashley and Thomas\nParry were ingrainedly loyal to Elizabeth, as she was to them. For\nconvenience we shall speak of the substitute of the Princess as","though he were the Princess herself whom he appeared to be, and for\nwhom he was accepted thenceforth. That the imposture--if there was\none--succeeded is a self-evident fact; for almost sixty years there was\nno question raised by any person of either sex and of any political\nopinion. The statecraft of England, France, the Papacy, and the German\nEmpire were either unsuspicious or in error--or both. It is reasonable\nto imagine that a person of strong character and active intelligence\r\nmight have steered deftly between these variously opposing forces. It\nis conceivable that in the case of a few individuals there might have\nbeen stray fragmentary clouds of suspicion; though if there were any\nthey must have come to those who were held to a consequent inactivity\nby other dominating causes. We shall have occasion presently to touch\non this subject but in the meantime we must accept it that there was no\r\nopinion expressed by any one in such a way as necessarily to provoke\naction. Of course after a time even suspicion became an impossibility.\nHere was a young girl growing into womanhood whom all around her had\nknown all her life--or what was equivalent--believed they had. It is\nonly now after three centuries that we can consider who it was that\nformed the tally of those who knew the personality of Elizabeth during\nboth periods of her youth, that up to 1543-4 and that which followed.\r\nHenry VIII manifestly not only had no doubt on the subject but no\nthought. If he had had he was just the man to have settled it at once.\nAnne Boleyn was dead, so was her predecessor in title. Anne of Cleves\nhad accepted the annulment of her marriage--and a pension. Jane Seymour\nand Catherine Howard were both dead. Nearly all those who as nurses,\ngovernesses, or teachers, Lady Bryan, Richard Croke, William Grindal,\nRoger Ascham, who knew the first period were dead or had retired into\r\nother spheres. Those who remained knowing well the individuality of the\nPrincess and representing both periods were Mrs. Ashley, Thomas Parry\nand the Queen (later dowager) Catherine Parr.\n\nWe know already of the faithfulness of the two former, the man who\nwas a clever as well as a faithful servant, and the woman, who having\nno children of her own, took to her heart the little child entrusted\nto her care and treated her with such affectionate staunchness--a","staunchness which has caused more than one historian to suspect that\nthere was some grave secret between them which linked their fortunes\ntogether.\n\nAs to Catherine Parr we are able to judge from her letters that she was\nfond of her step-daughter and was consistently kind to her. Those who\nchoose to study the matter further can form an opinion of their own\nfrom certain recorded episodes which, given without any elucidating\r\npossibilities leave the historians in further doubt. Leti puts in\nhis _Life_, under the date of 1543, “before her marriage to Henry,\nCatherine Parr had seen often Elizabeth and admired her.” The Italian\nhistorian _may_ have had some authority for the statement; but also\nit may have been taken from some statement made by Elizabeth in later\nyears or by some person in her interest, to create a misleading belief.\nIn any case let us accept the statement as a matter of fact. If so\r\nit may throw a light on another branch of this eternal and diverse\nmystery. Martin Hume and F. A. Mumby approaching the subject from\ndifferent points confess themselves puzzled by Elizabeth’s attitude to\nmen. The former writes in his _Courtships of Queen Elizabeth_:\n\n    “No one can look at the best portraits of Elizabeth without\n    recognising at a glance that she was not a sensual woman. The\n    lean, austere face, the tight thin lips, the pointed delicate\r\nchin, the cold dull eyes, tell of a character the very opposite\n    of lascivious.”\n\nMr. Mumby writing about Mrs. Ashley’s “Confession” and of the\nhorse-play between Elizabeth and Lord Seymour (whom Queen Catherine had\nmarried immediately after the King’s death) makes this remark:\n\n    “The most surprising thing about this behaviour is that the Queen\n    should have encouraged it.”\n\nThere is plenty of room for wonder, considering that Admiral Seymour\r\nhad earlier wanted to marry Elizabeth. But Catherine was a clever\nwoman, who had already had three husbands--Seymour was her fourth--and\nchildren. If any one would see through a boy’s disguise as a girl\nshe was the one. It is hard to imagine that Seymour’s wife had not\ngood cause for some form revenge on him of whom Hallam speaks of as a\n“dangerous and unprincipled man” and of whom Latimer said “he was a man","farthest from the fear of God that ever I knew or heard of in England”\nas it was believed at the time of her death that he had poisoned his\nwife, the Queen dowager, to make way for a marriage with Elizabeth,\nwith whom according to common belief he was still in love, it would\nbe only natural that a woman of her disposition and with her sense\nof humour, should revenge herself in a truly wifely way by using for\nthe purpose, without betraying the secret, her private knowledge or\r\nbelief of the quasi-princess’s real sex. Such would afford an infinite\ngratification to an ill-used wife jealous of so vain a husband.\n\n[Illustration: THE DUKE OF RICHMOND]\n\nWe now come to the crux of the whole story--the touchstone of this\nstrange eventful history. Could there have been such a boy as is told\nof; one answering to the many conditions above shown to be vitally\nnecessary for the carrying out of such a scheme of imposture. The\r\nanswer to this question is distinctly in the affirmative; there _could_\nhave been such a boy; had the Duke of Richmond been born fourteen or\nfifteen years earlier than he was, the difficulties of appearance,\nintellect, education, and other qualifications need not have presented\nthemselves.\n\nIf the question to be asked is: “Was there such a boy?” the\nanswer cannot be so readily given. In the meantime there are some\nconsiderations from the study of which--or through which--an answer\r\nmay, later, be derived.\n\n\nH. THE SOLUTION\n\n_The Duke of Richmond_\n\nThe points which must be settled before we can solve the mystery of the\n_Bisley Boy_ are:\n\n(1) Was there such an episode regarding the early life of the Princess\nElizabeth?\n\n(2) Was there such a boy as was spoken of?\n\n(3) How could such an imposture have been carried out, implying as it\ndid--\n\n(a) A likeness to the Princess so extraordinary as not to have created\nsuspicion in the mind of anyone not already in the plot.\r\n(b) An acquaintance with the circumstances of the life of the Princess\nsufficiently accurate to ward off incipient suspicion caused by any\noverlooking or neglect of necessary conditions.\n\n(c) An amount of education and knowledge equal to that held by a child\nof ten to twelve years of age who had been taught by some of the most\nlearned persons of the time.\n\n(d) A skill in classics and foreign tongues only known amongst high\nscholars and diplomatists.","(e) An ease of body and a courtliness of manner and bearing utterly\nforeign to any not bred in the higher circles of social life.\n\nIf there could be found a boy answering such conditions--one whose\nassistance could be had with facility and safety--then the solution is\npossible, even if not susceptible of the fullest proof. Following the\nlines of argument hitherto used in this book, let us first consider\nreasons why such an argument is tenable. I may then perhaps be allowed\r\nto launch the theory which has come to me during this investigation.\n\n\n(_a_) _His Birth and Appearance_\n\nA part--and no small part--of the bitterness of Henry VIII in not\nhaving a son to succeed him was that, though he had a son, such could\nnot by the existing law succeed him on the throne.\n\nNearly ten years after his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and after\na son and other children had been born to them, all of whom had died\r\nshortly after birth, Henry had in the manner of mediæval kings--and\nothers--entered on a love affair, the object of his illicit affection\nbeing one of the ladies-in-waiting to Queen Catherine, Elizabeth,\ndaughter of John Blount of Knevet, Shropshire.\n\nThe story of this love affair is thus given in quaint old English in\n_Grafton’s Chronicle_ first published in 1569 which covers the period\nfrom 1189 to 1558:\n\n    “You shall understande, the King in his freshe youth was in the\r\ncheynes of love with a faire damosell called Elizabeth Blunt,\n    daughter of Syr John Blunt Knight, which damosell in synging,\n    daunsing, and in all goodly pastimes, excelled all other, by the\n    which goodly pastimes, she wanne the king’s hart: and she againe\n    shewed him such favour that by him she bare a goodly man childe,\n    of beautie like to the father and mother. This child was well\n    brought up lyke a Princes childe.”\n\n\n(_b_) _His Upbringing and Marriage_\r\nThis son of an unlawful union--born in 1519 it is said--was called\nHenry Fitzroy after the custom applicable in such cases to the natural\nchildren of kings. Naturally enough his royal father took the greatest\ninterest in this child and did, whilst the latter lived, all in his\npower to further his interests. A mere list of the honours conferred on\nhim during his short life will afford some clue to the King’s intention","of his further advancement, should occasion serve. The shower of\nfavours began in 1525 when the child, as is said, was only six years of\nage. On the 18th of June of this year he was created Earl of Nottingham\nand Duke of Richmond and Somerset, with precedence over all dukes\nexcept those of the King’s lawful issue. He was also made a Knight of\nthe Garter--of which exalted Order he was raised to the Lieutenancy\neight years later. He was also nominated to other high offices: the\r\nKing’s Lieutenant General for districts north of the Trent; and Keeper\nof the city and fortress of Carlisle. To these posts were added those\nof Lord High Admiral of England, Wales, Ireland, Normandy, Gascony and\nAquitaine; Warden General of the Marches of Scotland, and Receiver\nof Middleham and of Sheriff Hutton, Yorkshire. He was also given an\nincome of four thousand pounds sterling per annum. In 1529, being then\nonly ten years of age, he was also made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,\r\nConstable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports--three of the\nmost important offices of the Nation. A few months before his death\nin 1536 there was a general understanding that Henry VIII intended to\nmake him King of Ireland and possibly to nominate him as his successor\non the throne of England. That some such intention was in Henry’s mind\nwas shown by the Succession Act passed just before the close of the\nParliament which was dissolved in 1536. In this Act it is fixed that\r\nthe Crown is to devolve on the King’s death to the son of Jane Seymour\nand in default of issue by him, on Mary and Elizabeth in succession\nin case of lack of issue by the former. In the event of their both\ndying before the King and without issue he is to appoint by will his\nsuccessor on the throne.\n\nThe various important posts conferred on the young Duke of Richmond\nwere evidently preparations for the highest post of all, which in","default of legitimate issue of his own legitimate children he intended\nto confer on him.\n\nThe education which was given to the little Duke is of especial\ninterest and ought in the present connection to be carefully studied.\nIt was under the care of Richard Croke, celebrated for his scholarship;\nwho in the modern branch was assisted by John Palsgrave the author of\nthe earliest English grammar of the French language “_Lesclarcissement\nde la langue Francoyse_.” In spite of the opposition of his household\r\nthe Duke of Richmond devoted his young life to study rather than to\narms. Whilst still a young boy he had already read a part of _Cæsar_,\n_Virgil_ and _Terence_, knew a little Greek, and was fairly skilful\nin music--singing and playing on the virginals. There was much talk\nin Court circles as to whom he should marry and many ladies of high\ndegree were named. One was a niece of Pope Clement VII; another was a\nDanish princess; still another a princess of France; also a daughter of\r\nEleanor, dowager Queen of Portugal, a sister of Charles V. This lady\nwas afterwards Queen of France.\n\nEarly in 1532 the Duke resided for a while at Hatfield. Then he went to\nParis with his friend the Earl of Surrey, son of the Duke of Norfolk.\nThere he remained till September, 1533. On his return to England he\nmarried by special dispensation, on 25 November, 1533, Mary Howard,\ndaughter of the Duke of Norfolk by his second marriage and sister of\r\nSurrey. Incidentally he is said to have been present at the beheading\nof Queen Anne (Boleyn), May 19, 1536. He did not long survive the\nlast-named exhibition, for some two months later--22 July, 1536, he\ndied. There was at the time a suspicion that he had been poisoned by\nLord Rochford, brother of Queen Anne (Boleyn).\n\nHenry Duke of Richmond and Somerset had no legal issue. As a matter\nof fact though he was married in 1533, nearly three years before his\r\ndeath, he never lived with his wife. It was said that he was not only\nyoung for matrimony, being only seventeen; but was in very bad health.\nIt was intended that after his marriage he should go to Ireland; but on\naccount of the state of his health that journey was postponed--as it\nturned out, for ever.\n\nA light on this ill-starred marriage is thrown in the quaint words of\nanother chronicler of the time, Charles Wriothesley, who wrote of the\ntime between 1485 and 1559.","“But the said younge duke had never layne by his wife, and so she\n    is maide, wife, and now a widowe; I praie God send her now good\n    fortune.”\n\nIn this summarised history certain points are to be noticed:\n\n(1) The Duke of Richmond was like his father (Henry VIII) and his\nmother who was “fayre.”\n\n(2) A Dispensation was obtained for his marriage to Lady Mary Howard\nwhich took place in 1533 but with whom he never cohabited.\r\nThere is a side-light here of the hereditary aspect of the case. Both\nthe Duke and Duchess of Richmond were “fayre,” and in the language of\nthe old chroniclers “fayre” means blonde. Wintown for instance speaking\nof Macbeth’s supposed descent from the Devil says:\n\n    “Gottyne he was on ferly wys\n    “Hys Modyr to woddis mad oft repayre\n    “For the delyte of halesum ayre.\n    “Swa, scho past a-pon a day\n    “Tyl a Wod, hyr for to play:\n    “Scho met at cas with a fayr man.”\r\nAnd Grafton thus speaks under date 7 September 1533 of Elizabeth’s\nbirth: “The Queen was delivered of a fayre Lady.”\n\nNow Anne Boleyn is described as small and lively, a brunette with black\nhair and beautiful eyes, and yet her daughter is given as red-haired by\nall the painters.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult to make out the true colours of persons. For\ninstance Giovanni Michiel writing to the Venetian Senate in 1557 puts\nin his description of Elizabeth “She is tall and well formed, with a\r\ngood skin, although swarthy” but in the same page he says “she prides\nherself on her father and glories in him; everybody is saying that\nshe also resembles him more than the Queen [Mary] does.” As to the\nintroduction of the word “swarthy” as above; it may have been one of\nthe tricks of Elizabeth to keep the Venetian ambassador from knowing\ntoo much or getting any ground for guessing. If so it looks rather like\nElizabeth concealing her real identity--which would be an argument in\r\nfavour of an imposture; if she was the real princess there would be no\nneed for concealment.\n\nIt is only common sense to expect, if the paternal element was so\nstrong in Henry as to reproduce in offspring his own colour, that had\nthe Duke of Richmond had any issue especially by a fair wife it too\nwould have inherited something of the family colour. Holbein’s picture\nof the “Lady of Richmond,” as the Duke’s wife was called, shows her as\na fair woman.","These are two points to be here borne in mind; that Henry VIII was\nprobably bald, for in none of his pictures is any hair visible. It\nwould hardly be polite to infer that Elizabeth wore a wig for the same\nreason. But it is recorded that she always travelled with a stock of\nthem--no less than eighty of various colours.\n\nBut there are other indications of such concealment. Why for instance\ndid she object to see doctors? So long as she was free and could\r\ncontrol them she did not mind; but whilst she was under duress they\nwere a source of danger. Perhaps it is this which accounts for her\ntaking the Sacrament on 26 August, 1554 when she was practically a\nprisoner at Woodstock in the keeping of Sir Henry Bedingfield. About\nthe third week in June the Princess asked Sir Henry to be allowed to\nhave a doctor sent to her. He in turn applied to the Council who made\nanswer on the 25th that the Queen’s Oxford physician was ill and Mr.\r\nWendy was absent and the remaining one, Mr. Owen, could not be spared.\nThe latter however recommended two Oxford doctors, Barnes and Walbec,\nin case she should care to see either of them. On July 4th Sir Henry\nreported to the Council that Elizabeth in politely declining said: “I\nam not minded to make any stranger privy to the state of my body, but\ncommit it to God.” Then, when through her submission to the Queen’s\r\nreligious convictions she had obtained her liberty, she took no more\nconcern in the matter.\n\n\n_The Duchess of Richmond_\n\nThomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, married twice. His second wife was the\nlady Elizabeth Stafford, eldest daughter of the Duke of Buckingham, and\nhe had issue by both marriages. In 1533 the only surviving daughter of\nthe second marriage was Mary, who was thus the Lady Mary Howard, sister\nof the Earl of Surrey. It was this lady with whom the uncompleted\r\nmarriage of the Duke of Richmond took place. Doubtless they were early\nfriends. In her youth she used to spend the summer at Tendring Hall,\nSuffolk, and the winter at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, where was one of\nHenry’s palaces; in addition Henry was one of the closest companions of\nher brother, the Earl of Surrey. Lady Richmond’s part in the historical\nepisode before us is hardly direct. It only comes in through two\ncircumstances not unattended with mystery. It is not necessary that","the two were correlated; but no student can get away from the idea\nthat there was some connection between them, especially when there is\nanother inference bearing on the subject with reference to the second\nmarriage of the Duchess. This took place after an interval of some\nyears to Gilbert, son of Sir George Talboys of Goloths, Lincolnshire.\nThe name of the second husband is variously spelled in the chronicles\nas Tailboise or Talebuse. She died in the year before Elizabeth came\r\nto the throne. The two things to examine closely with regard to\nthis marriage to the Duke of Richmond were the Dispensation for the\nmarriage (together with the date of it), and its non-fulfilment. The\nDispensation was dated 28 November, 1533, but the marriage took place\nthree days earlier. Whether this discrepancy had anything to do with\nher later marriage to Talboys we can only guess--unless of course more\nexhaustive search can produce some document, unknown as yet, which may\r\nthrow light on the subject. It is a matter of no light mystery why a\nDispensation was obtained at such a time and by whom it was effected.\nAt this time Henry VIII was engaged in the bitterest struggle of his\nlife, that regarding the supremacy of the Pope, so that it was a direct\nviolation of his policy to have asked for, or even to recognise such a\nDispensation in the case of his own son whom he intended to succeed him\r\nas King. Before a year had passed he had actually thrown over the Papal\nauthority altogether, and had taken into his own hands the headship\nof the National Church. What then was behind such a maladroit action?\nIf it had been done as a piece of statecraft--the ostensible showing\nthat there was as yet no direct rupture between the British Nation and\nthe Papacy--it would have lost its efficacy if it might be cited as\na Court favour rather than a national right. Moreover, as it was to\r\nsanction by then existing canonical law a marriage of Henry’s son with\na daughter of the head of the most powerful Catholic House in England,\nit could not be expected that Rome would not use this in its strife for\nthe continuation of its supremacy. If Henry was directly concerned in\nthe matter, it was bad policy and unlike him to conciliate Catholicism\nby a yielding on the part of one who would be in the future the Head","of the Reformed Church. Altogether it leaves one under the impression\nthat there must have been a more personal cause than any yet spoken of.\nSomething to be covered up, or from which suspicion should be averted.\nThere was already quite enough material for a controversy in case Henry\nFitzroy should come to the throne and it might be well to minimise\nany further risk. But in such case what was there to be covered up or\nfrom which suspicion should be averted? Already Richmond held under\r\nhis father all the threads of government in his own hand. If he ever\nshould need to tighten them it would be done by himself as ruler. There\nmust still be some reason which must be kept secret and of which Henry\nhimself did not and must not know. Beyond this again was the question\nof the personal ambition of “Bluff King Hal.” It was not sufficient\nfor him that a barren heir should succeed him--even if that heir was\r\nhis own son. He wanted to found a dynasty, and if he suspected for\nan instant that after all his plotting and striving--all his titanic\nefforts to overcome such obstacles as nations and religions--his hopes\nmight fail through lack of issue on his son’s part he would cease to\nwaste his time and efforts on his behalf. It is almost impossible to\nimagine that the Duke of Richmond had not had _some_ love affairs--if\nindeed he was only seventeen (of which there is a doubt)--it must be\r\nborne in mind that both the Lancastrians and the Yorkists who united\nin the Tudor stock matured early. On both his father’s and mother’s\nside Henry Fitzroy was of a pleasure-loving, voluptuous nature, and\nas the masculine element predominated in his make-up there is not any\ngreat stretch of imagination required to be satisfied that there was\nsome young likeness of him toddling or running about. But in a case\nlike his masculine mis-doing does not count; it is only where a woman’s\r\ncredit is at stake that secrecy is a vital necessity. We must therefore\nlook to the female side to find a cause for any mystery which there\nmay be. So far as a boy of the right age is concerned with a decided\nlikeness to Henry VIII it would not have required much searching about\nto lay hands on a suitable one.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n    The Lady of Richmond.\n\nTHE DUCHESS OF RICHMOND]\n\nBut here a new trouble would begin. It would be beyond nature to expect","that any mother would consent, especially at a moment’s notice, to\nher child running such a risk as the substitute of the dead Princess\nElizabeth was taking, without some kind of assurance or guarantee of\nhis safety. Moreover, if there were other relatives, they would be sure\nto know, and some of them to make trouble unless their mouths were\nclosed. Practically the only chance of carrying such an enterprise\nthrough would be if the substitute were an orphan or in a worse\r\nposition--one whose very life was an embarrassment to those to whom it\nshould be most dear.\n\nHere opens a field for romantic speculation. Such need not clash with\nhistory which is a record of fact. Call it romance if we will; indeed\nuntil we have more perfect records we must. If invention is to be\ncalled in to the aid of deduction no one can complain if these two\nmethods of exercise of intellect are kept apart and the boundaries\r\nbetween them are duly charted. Any speculation beyond this can be only\nregarded as belonging to the region of pure fiction.\n\nIn one way there is a duty which the reader must not shirk, if\nonly on his own account: not to refuse to accept facts without due\nconsideration. Wildly improbable as the Bisley story is, it is not\nimpossible. Whoever says, offhand, that such a story is untrue on the\nface of it ought to study the account of a death reported at Colchester\r\nin Essex just a hundred years ago. A servant died who had been in\nthe same situation as housemaid and nurse for thirty years. But only\nafter death was the true sex of the apparent woman discovered. It was\nmasculine!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere I must remind such readers as honour my work with their attention\nthat I am venturing merely to tell a tradition sanctioned by long time,\nand that I only give as comments historical facts which may be tested\r\nby any student. I have invented and shall invent nothing; and only\nclaim the same right which I have in common with every one else--that\nof forming my own opinion.\n\nHere it is that we may consider certain additions to the original\nBisley tradition. How these are connected with the main story is\nimpossible to say after the lapse of centuries; but in all probability\nthere is a basis of ancient belief in all that has been added. The\nfollowing items cover the additional ground.","When the governess wished to hide the secret hurriedly, she hid the\nbody, intending it to be only temporarily, in the stone coffin which\nlay in the garden at Overcourt outside the Princess’s window.\n\nSome tens of years ago the bones of a young girl lying amidst rags of\nfine clothing were found in the stone coffin.\n\nThe finder was a churchman--a man of the highest character and a member\nof a celebrated ecclesiastical family.\n\nThe said finder firmly believed in the story of the Bisley Boy.\r\nBefore Elizabeth came to the throne all those who knew the secret of\nthe substitution were in some way got rid of or their silence assured.\n\nThe name of the substituted youth was Neville; or such was the name of\nthe family with whom he was living at the time.\n\nThere are several persons in the neighbourhood of Bisley who accept the\ngeneral truth of the story even if some of the minor details appear at\nfirst glance to be inharmonious. These persons are not of the ordinary\r\nclass of gossipers, but men and women of light and leading who have\nfixed places in the great world and in the social life of their own\nneighbourhood. With some of them the truth of the story is an old\nbelief which makes a tie with any new investigator.\n\n\n_The Unfulfilled Marriage_\n\nThe remaining point to touch on is the unfulfilled marriage of the Duke\nof Richmond. This certainly needs some explanation, or else the mystery\nremains dark as ever.\r\nHere we have two young persons of more than fair presence, and graced\nwith all the endearing qualities that the mind as well as the eye can\ngrasp. We have the assurance of Chronicles regarding Henry Fitzroy;\nand from Holbein’s picture we can judge for ourselves of the lady’s\nmerits. They are both well-to-do. The lady, one of title, daughter of\none of the most prominent Dukes in England, the man then holding many\nof the most important posts in the State, and with every expectation of\r\nwearing in due course the purple of royalty. They both come of families\nof which other members have been notorious for amatory episodes;\nvoluptuousness is in their blood. They have been old friends--and yet\nwhen they marry they at once separate, she going to her own folk and\nhe to Windsor. Seemingly they do not meet again in the two and a half\nyears that elapse before his death. The story about his youth and\nhealth preventing cohabitation is all moonshine. The affair points to","the likelihood of some ante-matrimonial liaison of which, as yet, we\nknow nothing. Applying the experiences of ordinary life in such cases,\nwe can easily believe that Mary Howard, egged on by her unscrupulous\nand ambitiously-intriguing brother, was for ulterior purposes either\nforced or helped into an intrigue with the young Duke. There is no\ndoubt that Surrey was unscrupulous enough for it. A similar design on\nhis part--only infinitely more base--cost him his head. He had tried\r\nto induce his sister, Duchess of Richmond, to become mistress of Henry\nVIII--her own father-in-law!--so that she might have power over him;\nand it does not seem that there was any wonderful indignation on the\npart of the lady at the shameful proposal.\n\nWe are told that when Sir John Gates and Sir Richard Southwell, the\nroyal Commissioners for examining witnesses in the case of the charge\nof treason against the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Surrey, arrived\r\nat Kenninghall in the early morning and made known their general\npurposes in coming, the Duchess of Richmond “almost fainted.” But all\nthe same when she knew more exactly what they wanted she promised\nwithout any forcing to tell all she knew. As a matter of fact her\nevidence (with that of Elizabeth Holland, the mistress of the Duke of\nNorfolk), whilst it helped to get Norfolk off, aided in condemning\nSurrey. There must have been some other cause for her consternation.\r\nShe had been bred up in the midst of intrigues, polemical and dynastic\nas well as of personal ambition, and was well inured to keeping her\ncountenance as well as her head in moments of stress. The cause of her\n“almost fainting” must have been something which concerned her even\nmore nearly than either father or brother. It could only have been fear\nfor her child or herself--or for both. It is possible that she dreaded\r\ndiscovery of some sort. _Omne ignotum pro magnifico._ Suspicion has\nlong flexible tentacula, with eyes and ears at the end of them, which\ncan penetrate everywhere and see and hear everything. She knew how to\ndread suspicion and to fear the consequences which must result from\ninquiry or investigation of any sort. If she had had a child it must\nhave been kept hidden, and if possible far away--as the unknown Boy\nwas at Bisley. Indeed the Howards had immense family ramifications and","several of them had collateral relationships in and about Bisley. There\nwere Nevilles there, and doubtless some of them were poor relations\nrelegated to the far away place where living was cheap and where they\nmight augment their tenuous incomes by taking in even poorer relations\nthan themselves whose rich relatives wished to hide them away. It is\nonly a surmise; but if there had been a case of a child unaccounted\r\nfor, which any member of so great a family as the Howards wished to\nkeep dark, it would be hard to find a more favourable locality than\nthe little almost inaccessible hamlet in the Cotswolds. If there were\nsuch a child, how easy it would all have been. When the Duke was\nmarried he was fourteen or perhaps sixteen at most--an age which\nthough over-young for fatherhood in the case of ordinary men seemed to\noffer to the Plantagenet-York-Lancaster blood no absolute difficulty\r\nof taking up such responsibility. As Elizabeth was only born some two\nmonths before the Duke’s marriage there was not any time to spare--a\nfact which would doubtless have been used to his advantage if Henry’s\nnatural son had lived. In all probability Richmond’s marriage was a\npart of the plot for aggrandisement of the Howards which began with the\nunscrupulous securing by Surrey of the son of Henry VIII at the cost of\nhis sister’s honour; and ended with the death of Surrey as a traitor--a\r\ndoom which his father only escaped by the King dying whilst the Act\nof Attainder was lying ready for his signature. If this reasoning be\ncorrect--though the data on which it is founded be meagre and without\nactual proof--as yet--the risk of Duchess Mary’s child born before\nher marriage must have been a terrible hazard. On one side perhaps\nthe most powerful sceptre in the world as guerdon; on the other death\nand ruin of the child on which such hopes were built. No wonder then\r\nthat Duchess Mary “almost fainted” when in the early dawn the King’s\nCommissioners conveyed to her the broad object of their coming. No\nwonder that freed by larger knowledge from the worst apprehension which\ncould be for her, she announced her willingness to conceal nothing\nthat she knew. That promise could not and would not have been made\nhad the whole range of possibilities, which as yet no one suspected,\nbeen opened to their investigation. For even beyond the concern which","she felt from the arbitrary power of the King and at the remorseless\ngrip of the law, she had reason to doubt her own kin--the nearest of\nthem--in such a struggle as was going on around them when the whole of\nthe Empire, the Kingdom of England, France and Spain, and the Papacy\nwere close to the melting-pot. It would have been but a poor look-out\nfor a youth of a little more than a dozen years of age had fate made\r\nhim the shuttlecock of such strenuous players who did not hold “fair\nplay” as a primary rule of the game in which they were engaged.\n\nIn his _Life of Elizabeth_, Gregario Leti concludes a panegyric on the\nQueen’s beauty with the following: “This was accompanied by such inward\nqualities that those who knew her were accustomed to say that heaven\nhad given her such rare qualities that she was doubtless reserved for\nsome great work in the world.” The Italian historian perhaps “builded\r\nbetter than he knew,” for whether the phrase applies to the one who is\nsupposed to have occupied the throne or one who did so occupy it, it\nis equally true. The world at that crisis wanted just such an one as\nElizabeth. All honour to her whosoever she may have been, boy or girl\nmatters not.\n\n\n\n\nINDEX\n\n\n  Ahasuerus, 111-114.\n\n  Alcaçer-el-Kebir, battle of, 20-22, 25.\n\n  Alvares, Matheus, 23.\n\n  Althotas, 82.\n\n  Ascham, Roger, letters of concerning Elizabeth, 316-318.\r\nAshley, Mrs. Catherine, 284, 285, 298, 315, 321, 323, 324.\n\n  Austin, “Beau,” murder of by John Law, 124, 134.\n\n\n  Balsamo, Joseph, early life of, 80-82.\n\n  Bank of England, early history of, 140-142.\n\n  Banque Générale, founding of by John Law, 126.\n\n  Banque Royale, control of by John Law, 127, 130.\n\n  Berners Street Hoax, 252-254.\n\n  Beugnot, Comte de, description of Cagliostro by, 86, 87.\n\n  Bingham, Jinny, Mother Red-Cap, 186-189.\r\nBisley, 286-291, 294.\n\n  Bisley Boy, The, 283-345.\n\n  Bisley Tradition, The, 291-294, 339-340.\n\n  Bogus Sausages, 260-262.\n\n  Brinvilliers, Marquise de, 169-172.\n\n  Brunneau, Mathurin, 40-41.\n\n  Buried Treasure Hoax, The, 258-259.\n\n\n  Cagliostro, career of, 80-94.\n\n  Castro, Don John de, prophecy of concerning Sebastian, 24,\n    visit of to impostor, 26-27.\n\n  Cat Hoax, The, 255.\n\n  Catizzone, Marco Tullio, 27, 28, 29.\n\n  Catherine, Empress, 34.","Caule, Rev.

interesting one and impostors\r\nin one shape or another are likely to flourish as long as human nature\r\nremains what it is and society shows itself ready to be gulled\r\nthe histories of famous cases of imposture in this book have been\r\ngrouped together to show that the art has been practised in many\r\nformsimpersonators pretenders swindlers and humbugs of all kinds\r\nthose who have masqueraded in order to acquire wealth position or\r\nfame and those who have done so merely for the love of the art\r\nso numerous are instances indeed that the book cannot profess to\r\nexhaust a theme which might easily fill a dozen volumes its purpose is\r\nsimply to collect and record a number of the best known instances the\r\nauthor nevertheless whose largest experience has lain in the field of\r\nfiction has aimed at dealing with his material as with the material\r\nfor a novel except that all the facts given are real and authentic he\r\nhas made no attempt to treat the subject ethically yet from a study of\r\nthese impostors the objects they had in view the means they adopted\r\nthe risks they ran and the punishments which attended exposure any\r\nreader can draw his own conclusions\r\n\r\nimpostors of royalty are placed first on account of the fascinating\r\nglamour of the throne which has allured so many to the attempt perkin\r\nwarbeck began a life of royal imposture at the age of seventeen and\r\nyet got an army round him and dared to make war on harry hotspur\r\nbefore ending his short and stormy life on the gallows with a crown\r\nfor stake it is not surprising that men have been found willing to\r\nrun even such risks as those taken by the impostors of sebastian\r\nof portugal and louis xvii of france that imposture even if\r\nunsuccessful may be very difficult to detect is shown in the cases of\r\nprincess olive and cagliostro and in those of hannah snell mary east\r\nand the many women who in military and naval as well as in civil life\r\nassumed and maintained even in the din of battle the simulation of men\r\n\r\none of the most extraordinary and notorious impostures ever known was\r\nthat of arthur orton the tichborne claimant whose ultimate exposure\r\nnecessitated the employment at great public expense of time and\r\nmoney of the best judicial and forensic wits in a legal process of\r\nunprecedented length\r\n\r\nthe belief in witches though not extinct in our country even today\r\naffords examples of the converse of imposture for in the majority of\r\ncases it was the superstitions of society which attributed powers of\r\nevil to innocent persons whose subsequent mocktrials and butchery\r\nmade a public holiday for their socalled judges\r\n\r\nthe longcontinued doubt as to the true sex of the chevalier deon\r\nshows how a belief no matter how groundless may persist many cases\r\nof recent years may also be called in witness as to the initial\r\ncredulity of the public and to show how obstinacy maintains a belief\r\nso begun the humbert casetoo fresh in the public memory to demand\r\ntreatment herethe lemoine case and the long roll of other fraudulent\r\nefforts to turn the credulity of others to private gain show how\r\nwidespread is the criminal net and how daring and persevering are its\r\nmanipulators\r\n\r\nthe portion of the book which deals with the tradition of the bisley\r\nboy has had as it demanded more full and detailed treatment than\r\nany other one subject in the volume needless to say the author\r\nwas at first glance inclined to put the whole story aside as almost\r\nunworthy of serious attention or as one of those fanciful matters\r\nwhich imagination has elaborated out of the records of the past the\r\nwork which he had undertaken had however to be done and almost from\r\nthe very start of earnest enquiry it became manifest that here was\r\na subject which could not be altogether put aside or made light of\r\nthere were too many circumstancesmatters of exact record striking\r\nin themselves and full of some strange mystery all pointing to a\r\nconclusion which one almost feared to grasp as a possibilityto allow\r\nthe question to be relegated to the region of accepted myth a little\r\npreliminary work amongst books and maps seemed to indicate that so far\r\nfrom the matter vague and inchoate as it was being chimerical it was\r\none for the most patient examination it looked indeed as if those\r\nconcerned in making public the local tradition which had been buried\r\nor kept in hiding somewhere for three centuries were on the verge of\r\na discovery of more than national importance accordingly the author\r\nwith the aid of some friends at bisley and its neighbourhood went over\r\nthe ground and using his eyes and ears came to his own conclusions\r\nfurther study being thus necessitated the subject seemed to open\r\nout in a natural way one after another the initial difficulties\r\nappeared to find their own solutions and to vanish a more searching\r\ninvestigation of the time and circumstances showed that there was\r\nlittle if any difficulty in the way of the story being true in essence\r\nif not in detail then as point after point arising from others\r\nalready examined assisted the story probability began to take the\r\nplace of possibility until the whole gradually took shape as a chain\r\nlink resting in the strength of link and forming a cohesive whole that\r\nthis story impugns the identityand more than the identityof queen\r\nelizabeth one of the most famous and glorious rulers whom the world\r\nhas seen and hints at an explanation of circumstances in the life of\r\nthat monarch which have long puzzled historians will entitle it to the\r\nmost serious consideration in short if it be true its investigation\r\nwill tend to disclose the greatest imposture known to history and to\r\nthis end no honest means should be neglected\r\n\r\n            b

warbeck\r\n\r\n\r\nrichard iii literally carved his way to the throne of england it would\r\nhardly be an exaggeration to say that he waded to it through blood\r\namongst those who suffered for his unscrupulous ambition were george\r\nduke of clarence his own elder brother edward prince of wales who on\r\nthe death of edward iv was the natural successor to the english throne\r\nand the brother of the latter richard duke of york the two last\r\nmentioned were the princes murdered in the tower by their malignant\r\nuncle these three murders placed richard duke of gloucester on the\r\nthrone but at a cost of blood as well as of lesser considerations\r\nwhich it is hard to estimate richard iii left behind him a legacy of\r\nevil consequences which was farreaching henry vii who succeeded\r\nhim had naturally no easy task in steering through the many family\r\ncomplications resulting from the longcontinued wars of the roses\r\nbut richards villany had created a new series of complications on\r\na more ignoble if less criminal base when ambition which deals\r\nin murder on a wholesale scale is striving its best to reap the\r\nresults aimed at it is at least annoying to have the road to success\r\nlittered with the débris of lesser and seemingly unnecessary crimes\r\nfraud is socially a lesser evil than murder and after allhumanly\r\nspeakingmuch more easily got rid of thrones and even dynasties were\r\nin the melting pot between the reigns of edward iii and henry vii so\r\nthere were quite sufficient doubts and perplexities to satisfy the\r\nenergies of any aspirant to royal honourshowever militant he might\r\nbe henry viis time was so far unpropitious that he was the natural\r\nbutt of all the shafts of unscrupulous adventure the first of these\r\ncame in the person of lambert simnel the son of a baker who in \r\nset himself up as edward plantagenet earl of warwickthen a prisoner\r\nin the towerson of the murdered duke of clarence it was manifestly\r\na yorkist plot as he was supported by margaret duchess dowager of\r\nburgundy sister of edward iv and others with the assistance of the\r\nlorddeputy the earl of kildare he was crowned in dublin as king\r\nedward vi the pretensions of simnel were overthrown by the exhibition\r\nof the real duke of warwick taken from prison for the purpose the\r\nattempt would have been almost comic but that the effects were tragic\r\nsimnels span of notoriety was only a year the close of which was\r\nattended with heavy slaughter of his friends and mercenaries he\r\nhimself faded into the obscurity of the minor life of the kings\r\nhousehold to which he was contemptuously relegated in fact the whole\r\nsignificance of the plot was that it was the first of a series of\r\nfrauds consequent on the changes of political parties and served as a\r\nbalon dessai for the more serious imposture of perkin warbeck some\r\nfive years afterwards it must however be borne in mind that simnel\r\nwas a pretender on his own account and not in any way a pacemaker for\r\nthe later criminal he was in the nature of an unconscious forerunner\r\nbut without any ostensible connection simnel went his way leaving\r\nin the words of the kingly murderer his uncle the world free for his\r\nsuccessor in fraud to bustle in\r\n\r\nillustration perkin warbeck\r\n\r\nthe battle of stoke near newarkthe battle which saw the end of the\r\nhopes of simnel and his upholderswas fought on  june  five\r\nyears afterwards perkin warbeck made his appearance in cork as richard\r\nplantagenet duke of york the following facts regarding him and his\r\nlife previous to  may help to place the reader in a position to\r\nunderstand other events and to find causes through the natural gateway\r\nof effects\r\n\r\nto jehan werbecque or osbeck as he was called in perkins\r\nconfession controller of the town of tournay in picardy and his\r\nwife née katherine de faro was born in  a son christened\r\npierrequin and later known as perkin warbeck the low countries in the\r\nfifteenth century were essentially manufacturing and commercial and\r\nas all countries were at that period of necessity military growing\r\nyouths were thus in touch at many points with commerce industry and\r\nwar jehan werbecques family was of the better middle class as\r\nwitness his own position and employment and so his son spent the\r\nearlier years of his life amid scenes and conditions conducive to\r\nambitious dreams he had an uncle john stalyn of ghent a maternal aunt\r\nwas married to peter flamme receiver of tournay and also dean of the\r\nguild of schelde boatmen a cousin john steinbeck was an official of\r\nantwerp\r\n\r\nin the fifteenth century flanders was an important region in the\r\nmanufacturing and commercial worlds it was the centre of the cloth\r\nindustry and the coming and going of the material for the clothing of\r\nthe world made prosperous the shipmen not only of its own waters but\r\nthose of others the ships of the pretudor navy were small affairs\r\nand of light draught suitable for river traffic and be sure that the\r\nschelde with its facility of access to the then british port of calais\r\nto lille to brussels to bruges to tournai ghent and antwerp was\r\noften itself a highway to the scenes of continental and british wars\r\n\r\nabout  or  on account of the flemish war pierrequin left\r\ntournay proceeding to antwerp and to middleburg where he took\r\nservice with a merchant john strewe he being then a young boy of ten\r\nor twelve his next move was to portugal whither he went with the wife\r\nof sir edward brampton an adherent of the house of york a good deal\r\nof his early life is told in his own confession made whilst he was a\r\nprisoner in the tower about \r\n\r\nin portugal he was for a year in the service of a knight named peter\r\nvacz de cogna who according to a statement in his confession had\r\nonly one eye in the confession he also states in a general way that\r\nwith de cogna he visited other countries after this he was with a\r\nbreton merchant pregent meno of whom he states incidentally he made\r\nme learn english pierrequin werbecque must have been a precocious\r\nboyif all his statements are truefor when he went to ireland in\r\n with pregent meno he was only seventeen years of age and there\r\nhad been already crowded into his life a fair amount of the equipment\r\nfor enterprise in the shape of experience travel languages and so\r\nforth\r\n\r\nit is likely that to some extent at all events the imposture of\r\nwerbecque or warbeck was forced on him in the first instance and\r\nwas not a free act on his own part his suitability to the part he\r\nwas about to play was not altogether his own doing nay it is more\r\nthan possible that his very blood aided in the deception edward iv\r\nis described as a handsome debonair young man and perkin warbeck it\r\nis alleged bore a marked likeness to him horace walpole indeed in\r\nhis historic doubts builds a good deal on this in his acceptance of\r\nhis kingship edward was notoriously a man of evil life in the way of\r\naffairs of passion and at all times the way of illdoing has been\r\nmade easy for a king any student of the period and of the race of\r\nplantagenet may easily accept it as fact that the trend of likelihood\r\nif not of evidence is that perkin warbeck was a natural son of edward\r\niv three hundred years later the infamous british royal marriage\r\nact made such difficulties or inconveniences as beset a king in the\r\nposition of edward iv unnecessary but in the fifteenth century the\r\nusual way out of such messes was ultimately by the sword horace\r\nwalpole who was a clever and learned man was satisfied that the\r\nperson who was known as perkin warbeck was in reality that richard duke\r\nof york who was supposed to have been murdered in the tower in \r\nby sir james tyrrell in furtherance of the ambitious schemes of his\r\nuncle at any rate the people in cork in  insisted on receiving\r\nperkin as of the house of yorkat first as a son of the murdered\r\nduke of clarence warbeck took oath to the contrary before the mayor\r\nof cork whereupon the populace averred that he was a natural son of\r\nrichard iii this too having been denied by the newcomer it was\r\nstated that he was the son of the murdered duke of york\r\n\r\nit cannot be denied that the irish people were in this matter as\r\nunstable as they were swift in their judgments so that their actions\r\nare really not of much account five years before they had received\r\nthe adventurer lambert simnel as their king and he had been crowned\r\nat dublin in any case the allegations of warbecks supporters did\r\nnot march with established facts of gynecology the murdered duke of\r\nyork was born in  and as not twenty years elapsed between this\r\nperiod and warbecks appearance in ireland there was not time in the\r\nordinary process of nature for father and son to have arrived at\r\nsuch a quality of manhood that the latter was able to appear as full\r\ngrown even allowing for an unusual swiftness of growth common sense\r\nevidently rebelled at this and in  perkin warbeck was received in\r\nhis final semblance of the duke of york himself younger son of edward\r\niv many things were possible at a period when the difficulties of\r\nvoyage and travel made even small distances insuperable at the end of\r\nthe fifteenth century ireland was still so far removed from england\r\nthat even warbecks irish successes emphasised though they were by the\r\nearls of desmond and kildare and a numerous body of supporters were\r\nunknown in england till considerably later this is not strange if one\r\nwill consider that not until centuries later was there a regular postal\r\nsystem and that nearly two centuries later the lord chief justice\r\nsir matthew hale who was a firm believer in witchcraft would have\r\ncondemned such a thing as telegraphy as an invention of the devil\r\n\r\nin the course of a historical narrative like the present it must be\r\nborne in mind amongst other things that in the fifteenth century\r\nmen ripened more quickly than in the less strenuous and more luxurious\r\natmosphere of our own day especially in the tudor epoch physical gifts\r\ncounted for far more than is now possible and as early and too often\r\nsudden death was the general lot of those in high places the span of\r\nworking life was prolonged rather by beginning early than by finishing\r\nlate even up to the time of the napoleonic wars promotion was often\r\nwon with a rapidity that would seem like an ambitious dream to young\r\nsoldiers of today perkin warbeck born in  was nineteen years of\r\nage in  at which time the earl of kildare spoke of this french\r\nlad yet even then he was fighting king henry vii the harry richmond\r\nwho had overthrown at bosworth the great and unscrupulous richard iii\r\nit must also be remembered for a proper understanding of his venture\r\nthat perkin warbeck was strongly supported and advised with great\r\nknowledge and subtlety by some very resolute and influential persons\r\namongst these in addition to his irish cousins kildare and desmond\r\nwas margaret duchess of burgundy sister of edward iv who helped the\r\nyoung adventurer in his plot by coaching him up in the part which\r\nhe was to play to such an extent that according to lord bacon he\r\nwas familiar with the features of his alleged family and relatives and\r\neven with the sort of questions likely to be asked in this connection\r\nin fact he was in theatrical parlance not only properly equipped\r\nbut letterperfect in his part contemporary authority gives as\r\nan additional cause for this personal knowledge that the original\r\njehan de warbecque was a converted jew brought up in england of\r\nwhom edward iv was the godfather in any case it may in this age be\r\naccepted as a fact that there was between edward iv and perkin warbeck\r\nso strong a likeness as to suggest a prima facie possibility if\r\nnot a probability of paternity other possibilities crowd in to the\r\nsupport of such a guess till it is likely to achieve the dimensions of\r\na belief even without any accuracy of historical detail there is quite\r\nsufficient presumption to justify guesswork on general lines it were\r\na comparatively easy task to follow the lead of walpole and create a\r\nnew historic doubt after his pattern the argument of which would run\r\nthus\r\n\r\nafter the battles of barnet and tewkesbury in  edward iv had\r\nbut little to contend against his powerful foes were all either\r\ndead or so utterly beaten as to be powerless for effective war the\r\nlancastrian hopes had disappeared with the death of henry vi in the\r\ntower margaret of anjou wife of henry vi defeated at tewkesbury\r\nwas in prison warwick had been slain at barnet and so far as fighting\r\nwas concerned king edward had a prolonged holiday it was these years\r\nof peacewhen the coming and going of even a king was unrecorded with\r\nthat precision which marks historical accuracythat made the period\r\nantecedent to perkins birth perkin bore an unmistakable likeness to\r\nedward iv not merely that resemblance which marks a family or a race\r\nbut an individual likeness moreover the young manhood of the two ran\r\non parallel lines edward was born in  and in  before he\r\nwas nineteen won the battle of mortimers cross which with towton\r\nplaced him on the throne perkin warbeck at seventeen made his bid for\r\nroyalty it is hardly necessary to consider what is a manifest error\r\nin perkins confessionthat he was only nine years old not eleven\r\nat the time of the murder of edward v nineteen was young enough in\r\nall conscience to begin an intrigue for a crown but if the confession\r\nis to be accepted as gospel this would make him only seventeen at the\r\ntime of his going to irelanda manifest impossibility any statement\r\nregarding ones own birth is manifestly not to be relied on at best\r\nsuch can

extremely like the king\r\n    who on its being pointed out to him sent for his double and asked\r\n    him\r\n\r\n    was your mother ever at court\r\n\r\n    bowing low he replied\r\n\r\n    no sire

whatever steps might be necessary\r\nto protect his crown there had been but short shrift for lambert\r\nsimnel and perkin warbeck was a much more dangerous aspirant when\r\ncharles viii invited him to paris after the war with france had broken\r\nout henry besieged boulogne and made a treaty under which perkin\r\nwarbeck was dismissed from france after making an attempt to capture\r\nwaterford the adventurer transferred the scene of his endeavours\r\nfrom ireland to scotland which offered him greater possibilities for\r\nintrigue on account of the struggles between james iv and henry vii\r\njames who finally found it necessary to hasten his departure seemed\r\nto believe really in his pretensions for he gave him in marriage\r\na kinswoman of his own catherine gordon daughter of the earl of\r\nhuntlywho by the way was remarried no less than three times after\r\nperkin warbecks death through the influence of henry vii direct\r\nor indirect perkin had to leave scotland as he had been previously\r\nforced from burgundy and the low countries country after country\r\nhaving been closed to him he made desperate efforts in cornwall where\r\nhe captured st michaels mount and in devon where he laid siege\r\nto exeter this however being raised by the royal forces he sought\r\nsanctuary in beaulieu in the new forest where on promise of his life\r\nhe surrendered he was sent to the tower and well treated but on\r\nattempting to escape thence a year later  he was taken he was\r\nhanged at tyburn in the same year\r\n\r\npierrequin warbecques enterprise was in any case a desperate one\r\nand bound to end tragicallyunless of course he could succeed\r\nin establishing his alleged claim to the throne in law and then\r\nin supporting it at great odds the latter would

warbeck\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nb the hidden king\r\n\r\n\r\nthe personality nature and life of sebastian king of portugal\r\nlent themselves to the strange structure of events which followed\r\nhis strenuous and somewhat eccentric and stormy life he was born in\r\n and was the son of prince john and his wife juana daughter of\r\nthe emperor charles v he succeeded his grandfather john iii at\r\nthe age of three his long minority aided the special development\r\nof his character the preceptor appointed to rule his youth was a\r\njesuit luizgoncalvoz de camara not unnaturally his teacher used his\r\nposition to further the religious aims and intrigues of his strenuous\r\norder sebastian was the kind of youth who is beloved by his female\r\nrelativesquite apart from his being a king and naturally he was\r\ntreated by the women in a manner to further his waywardness when he\r\nwas fourteen years old he was crowned from thence on he insisted on\r\nhaving his way in everything and grew into a young manhood which was\r\nof the type beloved of an adventurous people he was thus described\r\n\r\nhe was a headstrong violent nature of reckless courage of boundless\r\nambition founded on a deep religious feeling at the time of his\r\ncoronation he was called another alexander he loved all kinds of\r\ndanger and found a keen pleasure in going out in a tempest in a small\r\nboat and in actually running under the guns of his own forts where his\r\ncommands were stringent that any vessel coming in shore should be fired\r\non he was a notable horseman and could steer his charger efficiently\r\nby the pressure of either kneeindeed he was of such muscular vigour\r\nthat he could by the mere stringency of the pressure of his knees\r\nmake a powerful horse tremble and sweat he was a great swordsman and\r\nquite fearless what is fear he used to say restless by nature he\r\nhardly knew what it was to be tired\r\n\r\nand yet this young manwarrior as he was had a feminine cast of\r\nface his features were symmetrically formed with just sufficient\r\ndroop in the lower lip to give the characteristic note of austrian\r\nphysiognomy his complexion was as fine and transparent as a girls\r\nhis eyes were clear and of blue his hair of reddish gold his height\r\nwas medium his figure fine he was vigorous and active he had an\r\nair of profound gravity and stern enthusiasm altogether he was even\r\nwithout his royal state just such a young man as might stand for the\r\nidol of a young maids dream\r\n\r\nand yet he did not seem much of a lover when in  he entered\r\nspain to meet philip ii at guadaloupe to ask the hand of the infanta\r\nisabella in marriage he was described as cold as a wooer as he\r\nwas ardent as a warrior his eyes were so set on ambition that mere\r\nwomans beauty did not seem to attract him eventseven that event\r\nthe meetingfostered his ambition when he knelt to his host the\r\nelder king kissed him and addressed him as your majesty the first\r\ntime the great title had been used to a portuguese king the effect\r\nmust have come but little later for at that meeting he kissed the\r\nhand of the old warrior the duke of alva and uncovered to him his\r\nunderlying pride however was shewn at the close of that very meeting\r\nfor he claimed equal rights in formality with the spanish king and\r\nthere was a danger that the visit of ceremony might end worse than it\r\nbegan neither king would enter the carriage in which they were to\r\nproceed together until the host suggested that as there were two doors\r\nthey should enter at the same time\r\n\r\nsebastians religious fervour and military ambition became one when\r\nhe conceived the idea of renewing the crusades he would recover the\r\nholy land from the dominion of the paynim and become himself master of\r\nmorocco in the doing of it with the latter object in his immediate\r\nview he made in  against the wise counsels of queen catherine\r\na sortie de reconnaissance of the african coast but without any\r\nresultexcept the fixing of his resolution to proceed in  his\r\nscheme was complete he would listen to no warning or counsel on the\r\nsubject even from the pope the grand duke of tuscany or the duke of\r\nnassau he seemed to foresee the realization of his dreams and would\r\nforego nothing he gathered an army of some  men of which less\r\nthan  were horsemen and about a dozen cannon the preparation was\r\nmade with great splendoura sort of forerunner of the great armada it\r\nseemed to be as in the case of the projected invasion of england ten\r\nyears later by spain a case of counting the chickens before they were\r\nhatched\r\n\r\nsome indication of the number of adventurers and camp followers\r\naccompanying the army is given by the fact that the  craft ordained\r\nfor the invasion of morocco carried in all some  persons\r\ninclusive of the fighting men the paraphernalia and officials of\r\nvictory comprised amongst many other luxuries lists for jousts a\r\ncrown ready for the new king of morocco to put on and poets with\r\ncompleted poems celebrating victory\r\n\r\nat this time morocco was entering on the throes of civil war muley\r\nabdelmulek the reigning sultan was opposed by his nephew mohammed\r\nand to aid the latter who promised to bring in  horsemen was the\r\nimmediate object of sebastian but the fiery young king of portugal had\r\nundertaken more than he was able to perform abdelmulek opposed his\r\n portuguese with  moors of whom  were horsemen\r\nand with three times his number of cannon the young crusaders\r\ngeneralship was distinctly defective he was a fine fighting man but\r\na poor commander instead of attacking at once on his arrival and so\r\nputting the zeal of his own troops and the discouragement of the enemy\r\nto the best advantage he wasted nearly a week in hunting parties and\r\nineffectual manœuvring when finally issue was joined abdelmulek\r\nthough he was actually dying surrounded the portuguese forces and cut\r\nthem to pieces sebastian though he fought like a lion and had three\r\nhorses killed under him was hopelessly beaten there was an attendant\r\npiece of the grimmest comedy on record the sultan died during the\r\nbattle but he was a stern old warrior and as he fell back in his\r\nlitter he put his finger on his lip to order with his last movement\r\nthat his death should be kept secret for the time being the officer\r\nbeside him closed the curtains and went on with the fight pretending\r\nto take orders from the dead man and to transmit them to the captains\r\n\r\nthe fate of sebastian was sealed in that battle whether he lived or\r\ndied he disappeared on  august  one story was that after the\r\nbattle of alcaçerelkebir his body stripped and showing seven wounds\r\nwas found in a heap of the slain that it was taken to fez and there\r\nburied but was afterwards removed to europe and found resting place\r\nin the convent of belen another story was that after a brilliant\r\ncharge on his enemies he was taken in but having been rescued by lui\r\nde brito he escaped unpursued certainly no one seemed to have seen\r\nthe king killed and it was strange that no part of his clothing or\r\naccoutrements was ever found these were of great splendour beauty and\r\nworth and must have been easily traceable there was a rumour that on\r\nthe night following the battle some fugitives amongst whom was one of\r\ncommanding distinction sought refuge at arzilla\r\n\r\nalcaçerelkebir was known as the battle of the three kings all the\r\nprincipals engaged in it perished sebastian was killed or disappeared\r\nabdelmulek died as we have seen and mohammed was drowned in trying\r\nto cross the river\r\n\r\nthe dubiety of sebastians death gave rise in after years to several\r\nimpostures\r\n\r\nthe first began six years after sebastians successorhis uncle\r\ncardinal henrywas placed on the throne the impostor was known as the\r\nking of penamacor the son of a potter at alcobaca he established\r\nhimself at albuquerque within the spanish borders somewhat to the\r\nnorth of badajos and there gave himself out as a survivor of the\r\nafrican campaign as usual the public went a little further and said\r\nopenly that he was the missing don sebastian at first he denied the\r\nsoft impeachment but later on the temptation became too great for him\r\nand he accepted it and set up in penamacor where he became known as\r\nthe king of penamacor he was arrested and paraded through lisbon\r\nbareheaded as if to let the public see that he in no way resembled the\r\npersonality of sebastian he was sent to the galleys for life but he\r\nmust have escaped for later on he appeared in paris as silvio pellico\r\nduke of normandy and was accepted as such in many of the salons in the\r\nexclusive faubourg st germain\r\n\r\nthe second personator of sebastian was one matheus alvares who having\r\nfailed to become a monk a year later imitated the first impostor and\r\nin  set up a hermitage at ericeira he bore some resemblance to the\r\nlate king in build and in the strength of this he boldly gave himself\r\nout as king sebastian and set out for lisbon but he was arrested\r\nby the way and entered as a prisoner he was tried and executed with\r\nfrightful accessories to the execution\r\n\r\nthe third artist in this imposture appeared in  he was a spaniard\r\nfrom madrigal in old castilea cook sixty years old sebastian would\r\nhave been just forty if he had lived when arrested he was given but\r\nshort shrift and shared the same ghastly fate as his predecessor\r\n\r\nthe fourth and last imposture was more serious this time the\r\npersonator began in venice in  calling himself knight of the\r\ncross\r\n\r\nas twenty years had now elapsed since the disappearance of sebastian\r\nhe would have changed much in appearance so in one respect the\r\npersonator had less to contend against moreover the scene of endeavour\r\nwas this time laid in venice a place even more widely removed in the\r\nsixteenth century from lisbon by circumstances than by geographical\r\nposition again witnesses who could give testimony to the individuality\r\nof the missing king of twenty years ago were few and far between but\r\non the other hand the new impostor had new difficulties to contend\r\nagainst henry the cardinal had only occupied the portuguese throne\r\ntwo years for in  philip ii of spain had united the two crowns\r\nand had held the dual monarchy for eighteen years he was a very\r\ndifferent antagonist from any one that might be of purely portuguese\r\norigin\r\n\r\nin the eyes of many of the peoplelike all the latin races naturally\r\nsuperstitiousone circumstance powerfully upheld the impostors\r\nclaim so long ago as  don john de castro had made a seemingly\r\nprophetic statement that sebastian was alive and would manifest himself\r\nin due time his utterance was like most such prophecies of the\r\nkind conducive to its own fulfilment there were manyand some of\r\nthem powerfulwho were willing at the start to back up any initiator\r\nof such a claim in his time sebastian had been used so far as it\r\nwas possible to use a man of his temperament and position by the\r\nintriguers of the catholic church and the present occasion lent itself\r\nto their stillexistent aims rome was very powerful four centuries\r\nago and its legions of adherents bound in many ties were scattered\r\nthroughout the known world be sure these could and would aid in any\r\nmovement or intrigue which could be useful to the church\r\n\r\nthe knight of the crosswho insinuated though he did not state\r\nso that he was a royal person was arrested on the showing of the\r\nspanish ambassador he was a born liar with all the readiness which\r\nthe carrying out of such an adventure as he had planned requires not\r\nonly was he well posted in known facts but he seemed to be actually\r\nproof against crossexamination the story he told was that after the\r\nbattle of alcaçerelkebir he with some others had sought temporary\r\nrefuge in arzilla and in trying to make his way from there to the east\r\nindies he had got to prester johns landthe semifabled ethiopia\r\nof those days from thence he had been turned back and had after\r\nmany adventures and much wanderingin the course of which he had been\r\nbought and sold a dozen times or more found his way alone to venice\r\namongst other statements he alleged that sebastians confessor had\r\nalready recognised and acknowledged him but he was doubtless ignorant\r\nwhen he made the statement that padre mauricio don sebastians\r\nconfessor fell with his king in  two things one a positive\r\ninference and the other negative told against him he only knew of\r\nsuch matters as had been made public in depositions and he did not\r\nknow portuguese the result of his first trial was that he was sent to\r\nprison for two years\r\n\r\nbut those two years of prison improved his case immensely in that\r\ntime he learned the portuguese language and many facts of history\r\none of the first to believeor to allege belief in his story fray\r\nestevan de sampayo a dominican monk was in  sent by the venetian\r\nauthorities to portugal to obtain an accredited description of the\r\npersonal marks of king sebastian he returned within a year with a\r\nlist of sixteen personal marksattested by an apostolic notary\r\nstrange to say the prisoner exhibited every one of thema complete\r\nagreement which in itself gave rise to the new suspicion that the list\r\nhad been made out by or on behalf of the prisoner the proof however\r\nwas acceptedfor the time and he was released on the th of july\r\nbut with the imperative humiliating proviso that he was to quit\r\nvenice within four and twenty hours under penalty of being sent to\r\nthe galleys a number of his supporters who met him before he went\r\nfound that he had in reality no sort of resemblance to sebastian don\r\njohn de castro who was amongst them said that a great change in\r\nsebastian seemed to have taken place he had prophesied and adhered\r\nto his prophecy he now described him as a man of medium height and\r\npowerful frame with hair and beard of black or dark brown and said\r\nhe had completely lost his beauty what has become of my fairness\r\nthe swarthy exprisoner used to say he had eyes of uncertain colour\r\nnot large but sparkling high cheek bones long nose thin lips with\r\nthe hapsburg droop in the lower one he was short from the waist\r\nup sebastians doublet would fit no other person his right leg\r\nand arm were longer than the left the legs being slightly bowed like\r\nsebastians he had small feet with extraordinarily high insteps and\r\nlarge hands in fine don john summed up illogically he is the\r\nselfsame sebastianexcept for such differences as resulted from years\r\nand labours some other particulars he added which are in no way\r\nhelpful to a conclusion\r\n\r\nthe impostor told his friends that he had in  sent a messenger\r\nfrom constantinople to portugalone marco tullio catizzonewho had\r\nnever returned thence he had travelled to romewhere when he was\r\njust on the eve of being presented to the holy father he was robbed of\r\nall he had thence to verona and so on to venice after his expulsion\r\nfrom venice he seems to have found his way to leghorn and florence and\r\nthence on to naples where he was handed over to the jurisdiction of\r\nthe spanish viceroy the count of lemos who had visited him in prison\r\nand who well remembered king sebastian whom he had seen when in a\r\ndiplomatic mission the viceroy came to the conclusion that he bore no\r\nlikeness at all to sebastian that he was ignorant of all save the well\r\nknown historical facts that had been published and that his speech\r\nwas of corrupt portuguese mingled with telltale phrases of calabrian\r\ndialect thereupon he took active steps against him one witness who\r\nwas produced recognized in him the real marco tullio catizzone and\r\ncount de lemos sent for his wife motherinlaw and brotherinlaw\r\nall of whom he had deceived and deserted his wife donna paula of\r\nmessina acknowledged him and he confessed his crime condemned to the\r\ngalleys for life marco tullio out of consideration of a possibility\r\nof an error of justice was so far given indulgence by the authorities\r\nthat he did not have to wear prison dress or labour at the oar many\r\nof his supporters who still believed in him tried to mitigate his\r\nlot and treated him as a companion so that the hulk at san lucar at\r\nthe mouth of the guadalquiver became a minor centre of intrigue but\r\nstill he was not content and adventuring further he tried to get\r\nmoney from the wife of medinasidonia then governor of andalusia he\r\nwas again arrested with some of his associates incriminating documents\r\nwere found on him he was racked and confessed all and so in his real\r\nname and parentage marco tullio son of ippolit catizzone of taverna\r\nand of petronia cortes his wife and husband of paula gallardetta\r\nwas executed he had though of liberal education never worked at\r\nany occupation or calling but he had previously to his great fraud\r\npersonated other menamongst them don diego of arragon on rd of\r\nseptember  he was dragged on a hurdle to the square of san lucar\r\nhis right hand was cut off and he was hanged five of his companions\r\nincluding two priests shared his fate\r\n\r\nbut in a way he and the previous impostors had a sort of posthumous\r\nrevenge for sebastian had now entered into the region of romantic\r\nbelief he was like king arthur the ideal and the heart of a great\r\nmyth he became the hidden king who would some day return to aid his\r\nnation in the hour of perilthe destined ruler of the fifth monarchy\r\nthe founder of an universal empire of peace\r\n\r\na hundred years ago the custom in british theatres was to finish\r\nthe evenings performance with a farce on this occasion the tragedy\r\nhad been finished two centuries before the comic relief came the\r\noccasion was in the french occupation of portugal in  the strange\r\nbelief in the hidden king broke out afresh a rigorous censorship\r\nof sebastianist literature was without availeven though its\r\ndisseminators were condemned by the stillexisting inquisition the old\r\nprophecy was renewed with a local and personal applicationnapoleon\r\nwas to be destroyed in the holy week of  by the waiting sebastian\r\nwhose approach from his mysterious retreat was to be veiled with a\r\nthick fog there were to be new portents the sky was to be emblazoned\r\nwith a cross of the order of aviz and on march th a full moon was\r\nto occur during the last quarter all these things were foretold in an\r\negg afterwards sent by junot to the national museum the general\r\nattitude of the french people towards the subject was illustrated by\r\na remark in an ironical manner of one writer what can be looked for\r\nfrom a people one half of whom await the messiah the other half don\r\nsebastian the authority on the subject of king sebastian m dantas\r\nrelates that as late as  after the crushing of a sebastianist\r\ninsurrection in brazil certain still believing sebastianists were to\r\nbe seen along the coast peering through the fog for the sails of the\r\nmythical ship which was to bring to them the hidden king who was then\r\nto reveal himself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc stefan mali\r\n\r\nthe false czar\r\n\r\n\r\nstefan mali stephen the little was an impostor who passed himself\r\noff in montenegro as the czar peter iii of russia who was supposed\r\nto have been murdered in  he appeared in the bocche di cattaro\r\nin  no one seemed to know him or to doubt him indeed after he\r\nhad put forth his story he did not escape identification one witness\r\nwho had accompanied a state visit to russia averred that he recognized\r\nthe features of the czar whom he had seen in st petersburg like all\r\nadventurers stefan mali had good personal resources an adventurer\r\nand especially an adventurer who is also an impostor must be an\r\nopportunist and an opportunist must be able to move in any direction\r\nat any time therefore he must be always ready for any emergency the\r\ntime the place and the circumstances largely favoured the impostor\r\nin this case it is perhaps but fair to credit him with foreknowledge\r\nintention and understanding of all that he did in after years he\r\njustified himself in this respect and showed distinctly that he was a\r\nman of brains and capable of using them he was no doubt not only able\r\nto sustain at the start his alleged personality but also to act under\r\nnew conditions and in new circumstances as they developed themselves\r\nas a man of czar peters character and acquired knowledge might have\r\ndone cesare augusto levi who is the authority on this subject says\r\nin his work venezia e il montenegro he was of fine presence and\r\nwell proportioned form and of noble ways he was so eloquent that he\r\nexercised with mere words a power not only on the multitude but also on\r\nthe higher classes he must certainly have been in st petersburg\r\nbefore he scaled montenegro and have known the true peter iii for\r\nhe imitated his voice and his gesturesto the illusionment of the\r\nmontenegrins there is no certainty of such a thing but he must\r\nin the belief of the vladika sava have been a descendant of stefano\r\nczernovich who reigned after giorgio iv\r\n\r\nat that time montenegro was ruled by vladika sava who having spent\r\nsome twenty years in monastic life was unfitted for the government of\r\na turbulent nation always harassed by the turks and always engaged in\r\na struggle for bare existence the people of such a nation naturally\r\nwanted a strong ruler and as they were discontented under the sway of\r\nsava the recognition of stefan mali was almost a foregone conclusion\r\nhe told a wonderful story of his adventures since his reported deatha\r\nstory naturally interesting to such an adventurous people and as he\r\nstated his intention of never returning to russia they were glad to\r\nadd such a new ally to their fighting force for the maintenance of\r\ntheir independence as the will of the people was for the newcomer\r\nthe vladika readily consented to confine himself to his spiritual\r\nfunctions and to allow stefan to govern the vladika of montenegro\r\nheld a strange officeone which combined the functions of priest and\r\ngeneralissimoso that the new division of the labour of ruling was\r\nrather welcome than otherwise to the people of a nation where no man\r\never goes without arms stephenas he now wasgoverned well he\r\ndevoted himself fearlessly to the punishment of illdoing and early\r\nin his reign had men shot for theft he established courts of justice\r\nand tried to further means of communication throughout the little\r\nkingdom which is after all little more than a bare rock he even\r\nso far impinged on savas sacred office as to prohibit sunday labour\r\nin fact his labours so much improved the outlook of the montenegrins\r\nthat the result brought trouble on himself as well as on the nation in\r\ngeneral hitherto whatever foreign nations may have believed as to the\r\nauthenticity of stephens claim they had deliberately closed their\r\neyes to his new existence so long as under his rule the little nation\r\nof montenegro did not become a more dangerous enemy to all or any of\r\nthem\r\n\r\nbut the nations interested grew anxious at the forward movement in\r\nmontenegro venice then the possessor of dalmatia was alarmed\r\nand turkey regarded the new ruler as an indirect agent of russia\r\ntogether they declared war this was the moment when fate declared\r\nthat the pretender should show his latent weakness of character the\r\nmontenegrins are naturally so brave that cowardice is unknown amongst\r\nthem but stephen did not dare to face the turkish army which attacked\r\nmontenegro on all the land sides but the montenegrins fought on till\r\na chance came to them after many months of waiting in the shape of a\r\nfearful storm which desolated their enemies camp by a sudden swoop\r\non the camp they seized much ammunition of which they were sadly in\r\nwant and by the aid of which they gained delivery from their foes\r\nthe russian government seemed then to wake up to the importance of\r\nthe situation and after sending the montenegrins much help in the\r\nshape of war material asked them to join again in the war against the\r\nturks the empress catherine in addition to this request sent another\r\nletter denouncing stephen as an impostor he admitted the charge and\r\nwas put in prison but in the impending war a strong man was wanted\r\nat the head of affairs and sava who now had the mundane side of\r\nhis dual office once more thrust again upon him was a weak one the\r\nsituation was saved by prince george dolgourouki the representative\r\nof the empress catherine who with statesmanlike acumen saw that\r\nsuch a desperate need required an exceptional remedy he recognized the\r\nfalse czar as regent stephen mali thus restored to power under such\r\npowerful auspices once more governed montenegro until  when he\r\nwas murdered by the greek player casamugnaby order it is said of\r\nthe pasha of scutari kara mahmound\r\n\r\nby the irony of fate this was exactly the way in which the real czar\r\nwhose personality he had assumed had died some dozen years before\r\n\r\nthis impostor was perhaps the only one who in the history of nations\r\nprospered finally in his fraud but as may be seen he was possessed of\r\nhigher gifts than most of his kind he was

such conditions no one can be sorry that death came to\r\nhis relief this was in june he being then in his eleventh year\r\nin the stress and turmoil of such an overwhelming cataclysm as the\r\nrevolution but little notice was taken of a death which under other\r\ncircumstances would undoubtedly have been of international interest\r\nif not of importance but by this time the death of

man\r\n\r\nhere then was the opening which presented itself at the end of the\r\neighteenth century france was in a state of social chaos the\r\nfountains of the deep were stirred and no human intelligence could\r\ndo more than guess at what might result from any individual effort of\r\nselfadvancement the public conscience was debauched and for all\r\npractical purposes the end justified the means it was an age of\r\ndesperate adventure of reckless enterprise of unscrupulous methods\r\nthe royalty of france was overthrownin abeyance till at least such\r\na time as some colossus of brains or energy or good fortune should\r\nset it up again the hopes of a great nation of return to a settled\r\norder of things through constitutional and historical channels were\r\ncentred in the succession to the crown and through the violence of the\r\nupheaval any issue was possible the state of affairs just before the\r\ndeath of louis xvii gave a chance of success to any desperate fraud\r\nthe old king was dead the new king was a child and in the hands of his\r\nbitterest enemies even if anyone had cared to vindicate his rights\r\nthere seemed at present no way of accomplishing this object to any\r\nreckless and unscrupulous adventurer here was an unique chance here\r\nwas a kingship going a daring hand might grasp the crown which rested\r\nin so perilous a manner on the head of a baby moreover the events of\r\nthe last fifteen years of the century had not only begotten daring\r\nwhich depended on promptness but had taught and fostered desperation\r\nit is a wonder to us who look back on that time through the\r\nsafetygiving mist of a century not that there was any attempt to get\r\na crown if only by theft but that there were not a hundred attempts\r\nmade for each one that history has recorded\r\n\r\nas a matter of fact there were seven attempts made to personate the\r\ndead dauphin son of louis xvi that son of st louis who in\r\nobedience to abbé edgworths direction to ascend to heaven went\r\nsomewhere where it is difficultor perhaps inexpedientto follow him\r\n\r\nthe first pretender appears to have been one jean marie hervagault son\r\nof a tailor his qualification for the pretence appears to have been\r\nbut a slender one that of having been born in  only about three\r\nyears before the dauphin this taken by itself would seem to be but\r\na poor equipment for such a crime but in comparison with some of the\r\nlater claimants it was not without reason of approximate possibility as\r\nfar as date was concerned it was not this criminals first attempt at\r\nimposture for he had already pretended to be a son of la vaucelle of\r\nlongueville and of the duc dursef having been arrested at hottot as a\r\nvagabond he was taken to cherburg where he was claimed by his father\r\nwhen claiming to be like the old man in mark twains inimitable\r\nhuckleberry finn the late dauphin his story was that he had as\r\na child been carried from the prison of the temple in a basket of\r\nlinen in  he was imprisoned at chalonssurmarne for a month he\r\nwas however so far successful in his imposture as louis xvii that\r\nafter some adventures he actually achieved a good followingchiefly\r\nof the landed interest and clerics he was condemned to two years\r\nimprisonment at vitry and afterwards to a term of twice that duration\r\nduring which he died in \r\n\r\nthe second and third aspirants to the honour of the vacant crown were\r\ninconspicuous persons possessing neither personal qualification nor\r\napparent claim of any sort except that of a desire for acquisition one\r\nwas persat an old soldier the other fontolive a bricklayer the\r\npretence of either of these men would have been entirely ridiculous but\r\nfor its entirely tragic consequences there is short shrift for the\r\nunsuccessful impostor of royaltyeven in an age of fluctuation between\r\nrebellion and anarchy\r\n\r\nthe fourth pretender was at least a better workman at crime than his\r\npredecessors this was mathurin brunneauostensibly a shoemaker\r\nbut in reality a vagabond peasant from vezins in the department of\r\nmaineetloire he was a born criminal as was shown by his early\r\nrecord when only eleven years of age he claimed to be the son of the\r\nlord of the village baron de vezins he obtained the sympathy of the\r\ncountess de turpin de crisse who seemed to have compassion for the\r\nboy even when the fraud of his parentage was found out she took him\r\nback into her householdbut amongst the servants after this his life\r\nbecame one of adventure when he was fifteen he made a tour through\r\nfrance in  he was put in the house of correction at st denis in\r\n he enlisted as a gunner in  he reappeared with an american\r\npassport bearing the name of charles de navarre his more ambitious\r\nattempt at personation in  was not in the long run successful\r\nhe claimed his rights as dauphin bourbon under louis xviii was\r\narrested at st malo and confined at bicêtre he got round him a\r\ngang of persons of evil life as shown by their various records one\r\nwas a false priest another a prisoner for embezzlement another an\r\nexbailiff who was also a forger another a deserter with the usual\r\ncriminal concomitant of women dishonoured clergy and such like at\r\nrouen he was sentenced to pay a fine of three thousand francs in\r\naddition to imprisonment for seven years he died in prison\r\n\r\nthe imposture regarding the dauphin was like a torchraceso soon\r\nas the lighted torch

and\r\nrepublishedwith enlargements by chevalier del corso in  is\r\nwithout any respect at all for the credulity of his readers\r\n\r\nthe story tells how an alleged doctor one answering to the not common\r\nname of jenaisojardias some time before the death of the dauphin had\r\nhad made a toy horse of sufficient size to contain the baby king the\r\nopening to the interior of which was hidden by the saddlecloth the\r\nwife of the gaoler simon helped in the plot the carrying out of which\r\nwas attempted early in  another child about the dauphins size\r\ndying or marked for death by fatal disease was drugged and hidden\r\nin the interior when the toy horse was placed in the dauphins cell\r\nthe children were exchanged the little king having also been drugged\r\nfor the purpose it would almost seem that the narrator here either\r\nlost his head or was seized with a violent cacoethes scribendi for\r\nhe most unnecessarily again lugs in the episode adapted from trojan\r\nhistory the worthy doctor of the double name had another horse\r\nmanufactured this time of life size into the alleged entrails of\r\nthis animal which was harnessed with three real horses as one of a\r\nteam of four the dauphin once more drugged was concealed he was\r\nborne to refuge in belgium where he was placed under the protection\r\nof the prince de condé by this protector he was according to his\r\nstory sent to general kléber who took him to egypt as his nephew under\r\nthe name of monsieur louis after the battle of marengo in  he\r\nreturned to france where he confided his secret to lucien bonaparte\r\nand to fouché the minister of police who got him introduced to the\r\nempress josephine who recognised him by a scar over his right eye in\r\n still according to his story he embarked for america and got\r\naway to the banks of the amazon where amid the burning deserts as\r\nhe put it he had adventures capable of consuming lesser romancists\r\nwith envy some of these adventures were amongst a tribe called the\r\nmameluckswhich name was at least reminiscent of his alleged egyptian\r\nexperiences from the burning deserts on the banks of the amazon he\r\nfound his way to brazil where a certain don juan late of portugal\r\nand at that time regent of brazil gave him asylum\r\n\r\nleaving the hospitable home of don juan he returned to paris in \r\nhere condé introduced him to the duchesse dangoulême his sister\r\nand according to his own naïve statement the princess was greatly\r\nsurprised as indeed she might well have beenquite as much as the\r\nwitch

france\r\nunder the name of herbert he was in paris the following year under\r\nthe name of colonel gustave and forthwith revived his fraud of being\r\nthe late dauphin in  he appealed to the chamber of peers to\r\nthis appeal he appears to have received no direct reply but apropos\r\nof it baron mounier made a proposition to the chamber that in future\r\nno such application should be received unless properly signed and\r\nattested and presented by a member of the chamber he gathered round\r\nhim some dupes who believed in him to these he told a number of\r\nstrange lies based on some form of perverted truth but always taking\r\ncare that those of whom he spoke were already dead amongst them was\r\nthe wife of simon who had died in  desault the surgeon who\r\nhad medical care of louis

hearing many witnesses the\r\ncourt condemned him to imprisonment for twelve years he was arraigned\r\nunder the name of ethelbert louishectoralfred calling himself the\r\nbaron de richmont he escaped

even seeming suitably prepared by time for the part\r\nwhich he had thus voluntarily undertaken having been born in \r\nand thus having been as old at the birth of the dauphin as the latter\r\nwas when he died this individual had appeared in berlin in \r\nand was married in spandau eight years later he had been punished\r\nfor incendiarism in  and later got three years imprisonment\r\nat brandenburg for coining he may be considered as a fairly good\r\nallroundif unsuccessfulcriminal in england he was imprisoned for\r\ndebt he died in delft in \r\n\r\nthe last attempt at impersonating louis xvii the seventh afforded\r\nwhat might in theatrical parlance be called the comic relief of the\r\nwhole series both as regards means and results this time the claimant\r\nto the kingship of france was none other than a halfbred iroquois one\r\ncalled eleazar who appeared to be the ninth son of thomas williams\r\notherwise thorakwaneken and an indian woman mary ann konwatewentala\r\nthis lady who spoke only iroquois said at the opportune time she was\r\nnot the mother of lazar iroquois for eleazar she made her mark as\r\nshe could not write eleazar had been almost an idiot till the age\r\nof thirteen but being struck on the head by a stone recovered his\r\nmemory and intelligence he said he remembered sitting on the knees of\r\na beautiful lady who wore a rich dress with a train he also remembered\r\nseeing in his childhood a terrible person shewn the picture of simon\r\nhe recognised him with terror he learned english but imperfectly\r\nbecame a protestant and a missionary and married his profile was\r\nsomething like that of the typical bourbon in  the prince de\r\njoinville seeing him on his travels in the united states told him\r\naccording to eleazars account that he was the son of a king and got\r\nhim to sign and seal a parchment already prepared the same being a\r\nsolemn abdication of the crown of france in favour of louis philippe\r\nmade by charles louis son of louis xvi also styled louis xvii king of\r\nfrance and navarre the seal used was the seal of france the one used\r\nby the old monarchy the poor indian with untutored mind made with\r\ncharming diffidence the saving clause regarding the sealif i am not\r\nmistaken of course there was in the abdication a clause regarding\r\nthe payment of a sum of money which would enable me to live in great\r\nluxury in this country or in france as i might choose the reverend\r\neleazar despite his natural disadvantages and difficulties was\r\nmore fortunate than his fellow claimants inasmuch as the time of his\r\nimposture was more propitious louis philippe who was always anxious\r\nto lessen the danger to his tottering throne made a settlement on him\r\nfrom his civil list and the subsequent proceedings interested him no\r\nmore\r\n\r\naltogether the louis xvii impostures extended over a period of some\r\nsixty years beginning with hervagaults pretence soon after the death\r\nof the dauphin and closing at gleyze with the death of henri herbert\r\nthe alleged baron de richmont who appeared as the alleged duc de\r\nnormandie\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ne princess olive\r\n\r\n\r\nthe story of mrs olive serres as nature made it was one thing it\r\nwas quite another as she made it for herself the result before the\r\nstory was completely told was a third and compared with the other\r\none of transcendent importance altogether her efforts whatsoever\r\nthey were and crowned never so effectively showed a triumph in its\r\nway of the thaumaturgic art of lying but like all structures built\r\non sand it collapsed eventually in the plain versionnaturesthe\r\nfacts were simply as follows she and a brother of no importance were\r\nthe children of a house painter living in warwick one robert wilmot\r\nand of anna maria his wife having been born in  she was under\r\nage when in  she was married the ceremony therefore requiring\r\nlicence supported by bond and affidavit her husband was john thomas\r\nserres who ten years later was appointed marine painter to king george\r\niii mr and mrs serres were separated in  after the birth of two\r\ndaughters the elder of whom born in  became in  the wife\r\nof antony thomas ryves a portrait painterwhom she divorced in \r\nmrs a t ryves twelve years later filed a petition praying that the\r\nmarriage of her mother made in  might be declared valid and she\r\nherself the legitimate issue of that marriage the case was heard in\r\n mrs ryves conducting it in person having produced sufficient\r\nevidence of the marriage and the birth and there being no opposition\r\nthe court almost as a matter of course pronounced the decree asked for\r\nin this case no complications in the way of birth or marriage of mrs\r\nserres were touched on\r\n\r\nrobert wilmot the housepainter had an elder brother james who became\r\na fellow of trinity college oxford and went into the church taking\r\nhis degree of doctor of divinity through his college he was presented\r\nin  to the living of bartonontheheath warwickshire the\r\nstatutes of his college contained a prohibition against marriage whilst\r\na fellow james wilmot d d died in  leaving his property between\r\nthe two children of robert after lifeuse by his brother james and\r\nrobert wilmot had a sister olive who was born in  and married in\r\n to william payne with issue one daughter olivia born in \r\nrobert wilmot died in \r\n\r\nillustration olivia serres\r\n\r\nout of these rough materials mrs olive serres set herself in due\r\ncourse to construct and carry out as time and opportunity allowed\r\nand as occasions presented themselves and developed a fraudulent\r\nromance in real life and action she was however a very clever\r\nwoman and in certain waysas was afterwards proved by her literary and\r\nartistic workwell dowered by nature for the taskcrooked though it\r\nwaswhich she set for herself her ability was shown not only by what\r\nshe could do and did at this time of her life but by the manner in\r\nwhich she developed her natural gifts as time went on in the sum of\r\nher working life in which the perspective of days becomes merged in\r\nthat of years she touched on many subjects not always of an ordinary\r\nkind which shewed often that she was of conspicuous ability having\r\nbecome accomplished in several branches of art she was a painter of\r\nsufficient merit to have exhibited her work in the royal academy in\r\n and to be appointed landscapepainter to the prince of wales in\r\n she was a novelist a press writer an occasional poet and in\r\nmany ways of a ready pen she was skilled in some forms of occultism\r\nand could cast horoscopes she wrote in addition to a pamphlet on\r\nthe same subject a book on the writings of junius claiming to have\r\ndiscovered the identity of the authornone other than james wilmot\r\nd d she wrote learnedly on disguised handwriting in fact she touched\r\non the many phases of literary effort which come within the scope of\r\nthose who live by the work of their brains perhaps indeed it was\r\nher facility as a writer that helped to lead her astray for in her\r\npractical draughtsmanship and in her brain teeming with romantic ideas\r\nshe found a means of availing herself of opportunities suggested by\r\nher reckless ambition doubtless the cramped and unpoetic life of her\r\nhumble condition in the housepainters home in warwick made her fret\r\nand chafe under its natural restraint but when she saw her way to\r\nan effective scheme of enlarging her selfimportance she acted with\r\nextraordinary daring and resource as is usual with such natures\r\nwhen moral restraints have been abandoned the pendulum swung to\r\nits opposite as she had been lowly she determined to be proud and\r\nhaving fixed on her objective began to elaborate a consistent scheme\r\nutilising the facts of her own surroundings as the foundation of her\r\nimposture she probably realised early that there must be a base\r\nsomewhere and so proceeded to manufacture or arrange for herself a new\r\nidentity into which the demonstrable facts of her actual life could be\r\nwrought at the same time she manifestly realised that in a similar\r\nway fact and intention must be interwoven throughout the whole of\r\nher contemplated creation accordingly she created for herself a new\r\nmilieu which she supported by forged documents of so clever a conceit\r\nand such excellent workmanship that they misled all who investigated\r\nthem until they came within the purview of the great lawyers of the\r\nday whose knowledge logical power skill and determination were\r\narrayed against her by a sort of intellectual metabolism she changed\r\nthe identities and conditions of her own relations whom i have\r\nmentioned always taking care that her story held together in essential\r\npossibilities and making use of the abnormalities of those whose\r\nprototypes she introduced into fictional life\r\n\r\nthe changes made in her world of new conditions were mainly as follows\r\nher uncle the reverend james who as a man of learning and dignity\r\nwas accustomed to highclass society and as a preacher of eminence\r\noccasionally in touch with crown and court became her father and she\r\nherself the child of a secret marriage with a great lady whose personal\r\nrank and condition would reflect importance on her daughter but proof\r\nor alleged proof of some kind would be necessary and there were too\r\nmany persons at present living whose testimony would be available\r\nfor her undoing so her uncle james shifted his place and became\r\nher grandfather to this the circumstances of his earlier life gave\r\ncredibility in two ways firstly because they allowed of his having\r\nmade a secret marriage since he was forbidden to marry by the statutes\r\nof his college and secondly because they gave a reasonable excuse for\r\nconcealing his marriage and the birth of a child publicity regarding\r\nwhich would have cost him his livelihood\r\n\r\nat this point the story began to grow logically and the whole scheme\r\nto expand cohesively her genius as a writer of fiction was being\r\nproved and with the strengthening of the intellectual nature came\r\nthe atrophy of the moral she began to look higher and the seeds of\r\nimagination took root in her vanity till the madness latent in her\r\nnature turned wishes into beliefs and beliefs into facts as she was\r\nimagining on her own behoof why not imagine beneficially this all\r\ntook time so that when she was well prepared for her venture things\r\nhad moved on in the nation and the world as well as in her fictitious\r\nromance manifestly she could not make a start on her venture until\r\nthe possibility vanished of witnesses from the inner circle of her\r\nown family being brought against her so that she could not safely\r\nbegin machinations for some time she determined however to be ready\r\nwhen occasion should serve in the meantime she had to lead two lives\r\noutwardly she was olive serres daughter of robert wilmot born in \r\nand married in  and mother of two daughters inwardly she was\r\nthe same woman with the same birth marriage and motherhood but of\r\ndifferent descent being imaginatively granddaughter of her real\r\nuncle the rev james wilmot d d the gaps in the imaginary descent\r\nhaving been thus filled up as made and provided in her own mind she\r\nfelt more safe her uncleso ran her fictionhad early in his college\r\nlife met and become friends with count stanislaus poniatowski who later\r\nbecame by election king of poland count poniatowski had a sisterwhom\r\nthe ingenious olive dubbed princess of polandwho became the wife\r\nof her uncle now her grandfather james to them was born in \r\na daughter olive the marriage being kept secret for family reasons\r\nand the child for the same reason being passed off as the offspring of\r\nrobert the housepainter this child olive according to the fiction\r\nmet his royal highness henry frederick duke of cumberland brother\r\nof the king george iii they fell in love with each other and were\r\nprivately marriedby the rev james wilmot d don  march \r\nthey had issue one daughter olive born at warwick  april  after\r\nliving with her for four years the duke of cumberland deserted his\r\nwife who was then pregnant and in  marriedbigamously it was\r\nallegedlady anne horton sister of colonel luttrell daughter of lord\r\nirnham and widow of andrew horton of catton derbyshire the alleged\r\nroyal duchess died in france in  and the duke in \r\n\r\nthus fact and fiction were arrayed together in a very cunning way\r\nthe birth of olive wilmot afterwards serres in  was proved by a\r\ngenuine registry likewise that of her daughter mrs ryves for all the\r\nrest the certificates were forged moreover there was proof of another\r\nolive wilmot whose existence supported by genuine registration might\r\navert suspicion since it would be difficult to prove after a lapse of\r\ntime that the olive wilmot born at warwick in  daughter of robert\r\nthe housepainter was not the granddaughter of james the doctor of\r\ndivinity in case of necessity the real date  of the birth of\r\nolive wilmot sister of the rev james could easily be altered to the\r\nfictitious date of the birth of princess olive born \r\n\r\nit was only in  that mrs serres began to take active measures for\r\ncarrying her imposture into action and in the process she made some\r\ntentative efforts which afterwards made difficulty for her at first\r\nshe sent out a story through a memorial to george iii that she was\r\ndaughter of the duke of cumberland by mrs payne wife of captain payne\r\nand sister of james wilmot d d this she amended later in the same\r\nyear by alleging that she was a natural daughter of the duke by the\r\nsister of doctor wilmot whom he had seduced under promise of marriage\r\nit was not till after the deaths of george iii and the duke of kent in\r\n that the story took its third and final form\r\n\r\nit should be noticed that care was taken not to clash with laws already\r\nin existence or to run counter to generally received facts in  was\r\npassed the royal marriage act  george iii cap  which nullified\r\nany marriage contracted with anyone in the succession to the crown to\r\nwhich the monarch had not given his sanction therefore mrs serres\r\nhad fixed the alleged marriage of the alleged olive wilmot with\r\nthe duke of cumberland as in five years earlierso that the\r\nact could not be brought forward as a bar to its validity up to \r\nsuch marriages could take place legally indeed there was actually a\r\ncase in existencethe duke of gloucester another brother of the king\r\nhaving married the dowager countess of waldegrave it was of common\r\nrepute that this marriage was the motive of the kings resolve to have\r\nthe royal marriage act added to the statute book at the main trial it\r\nwas alleged by counsel in making the petitioners claim that the king\r\ngeorge iii was aware of the duke of cumberlands marriage with olive\r\nwilmot although it was not known to the public and that when he heard\r\nof his marriage with lady anne horton he was very angry and would not\r\nallow them to come to court\r\n\r\nthe various allegations of mrs serres as to her mothers marriage were\r\nnot treated seriously for a long time but they were so persisted in\r\nthat it became necessary to have some denial in evidence accordingly a\r\nlawcase was entered one which became a cause célèbre it began in\r\njust about a hundred years from the time of the alleged marriage\r\nwith such a long gap the difficulties of disproving mrs serres\r\nallegations were much increased but there was no help for it reasons\r\nof state forbade the acceptance or even the doubt of such a claim the\r\nreally important point was that if by any chance the claimant should\r\nwin the succession would be endangered\r\n\r\nthe presiding judge was the lord chief justice lord cockburn with\r\nhim sat lord chief baron pollock and the judge ordinary sir james\r\nwilde there was a special jury the case took the form of one in the\r\nenglish probate court made under the legitimacy declaration act in\r\nthis case mrs ryves daughter of mrs serres was the petitioner\r\nassociated with her in the claim was her son who however is of no\r\ninterest in the matter and need not be considered the petition stated\r\nthat mrs ryves was the legitimate daughter of one john thomas serres\r\nand olive his wife the said olive being whilst living a naturalborn\r\nsubject and the legitimate daughter of henry frederick duke of\r\ncumberland and olive wilmot his wife that the said olive wilmot born\r\nin  was lawfully married to his royal highness henry frederick\r\nduke of cumberland fourth son of frederick prince of wales thus being\r\ngrandson of george ii and brother of king george iii on  march \r\nat the house of thomas lord archer in grosvenor square london the\r\nmarriage being performed by the rev james wilmot d d father of the\r\nsaid olive wilmot that a child olive was born to them on  april\r\n who in  was married to john thomas serres and so on in\r\naccordance with the alleged facts above given\r\n\r\nthe strange position was that even if the petitioner should win her\r\nmain case she would prove her own illegitimacy for granting that the\r\nalleged olive serres should have been legally married to the duke of\r\ncumberland the royal marriage act passed five years later forbade\r\nthe union of the child of such a marriage except with the sanction of\r\nthe reigning monarch\r\n\r\nin the making of the claim of mrs ryves a grave matter appearedone\r\nwhich rendered it absolutely necessary that the case should be heard\r\nin the most formal and adequate way and settled once for all the\r\nmatter was one affecting the legality of the marriage of george iii\r\nand so touching the legitimacy of his son afterwards george iv his son\r\nafterwards william iv and his son the duke of kent father of queen\r\nvictoriaand so debarring them and all their descendants from the\r\ncrown of england the points of contact were in documents insidiously\r\nthough not overtly produced and the preparation of which showed much\r\nconstructive skill in the world of fiction amongst the many documents\r\nput in evidence by the counsel for mrs ryves were two certificates of\r\nthe alleged marriage between olive wilmot and the duke of cumberland\r\non the back of each of these alleged certificates was written what\r\npurported to be a certificate of the marriage of george iii to hannah\r\nlightfoot performed in  by j wilmot the wording of the documents\r\nvaried slightly\r\n\r\nit was thus that the claim of mrs ryves and her son became linked\r\nup with the present and future destinies of england these alleged\r\ndocuments too brought the attorney general upon the scene there\r\nwere two reasons for this firstly the action had to be taken against\r\nthe crown in the matter of form secondly in such a case with the\r\npossibility of such vast issues it was absolutely necessary that every\r\nposition should be carefully guarded every allegation jealously\r\nexamined in each case the attorney general was the proper official to\r\nact\r\n\r\nthe case of the petitioners was prepared with extraordinary care\r\nthere were amongst the documents produced numbering over seventy\r\nsome containing amongst them fortythree signatures of dr wilmot\r\nsixteen of lord chatham twelve of mr dunning afterwards the st\r\nbaron ashburton twelve of george iii thirtytwo of lord warwick and\r\neighteen of hrh the duke of kent the father of queen victoria\r\ntheir counsel stated that although these documents had been repeatedly\r\nbrought to the notice of the successive ministers of the crown it had\r\nnever been suggested until that day that they were forgeries this\r\nlatter statement was traversed in court by the lord chief baron who\r\ncalled attention to a debate on the subject in the house of commons in\r\nwhich they were denounced as forgeries\r\n\r\nin addition to those documents already quoted were the following\r\ncertificates\r\n\r\n    the marriage of these parties was this day duly solemnized at\r\n    kew chapel according to the rites and ceremonies of the church\r\n    of england by

the\r\nattorneygeneral sir roundell palmer afterwards lord chancellor\r\nand first earl of selborne appear himself but he was supported by\r\nthe solicitorgeneral the queens advocate mr hannen and mr r\r\nbourke the attorneygeneral made the defence himself at the outset\r\nit was difficult to know where to begin for everywhere undoubted and\r\nunchallenged facts were interwoven with the structure of the case and\r\nof all the weaknesses and foibles of the important persons mentioned\r\nfull advantage was taken the marriage of the duke of gloucester to\r\nlady waldegrave had made him unpopular in every way and he was at the\r\ntime a persona ingrata at court there had been rumours of scandal\r\nabout the king when prince of wales and the fair quaker hannah\r\nlightfoot the anonymity of the author of the celebrated letters of\r\njunius which attacked the king so unmercifully lent plausibility to\r\nany story which might account for it the case of mrs ryves tried\r\nin  in which her own legitimacy had been proved and in which\r\nindisputable documents had been used was taken as a proof of her bona\r\nfides\r\n\r\nmrs ryves herself was in the box for nearly the whole of three days\r\nduring which she bore herself firmly refusing even to sit down when\r\nthe presiding judge courteously extended that privilege to her she\r\nwas then by her own statement over seventy years of age in the\r\ncourse of her evidence a memorial to george iv was produced written\r\nby her mother mrs serres in which the word offspring was spelled\r\norfspring in commenting on which the attorneygeneral produced a\r\ncongratulatory ode to the prince regent on his birthday in  by the\r\nsame author in which occurred the line\r\n\r\nhail valued heir orfspring of heavens smile similar eccentric\r\northography was found in other autograph papers of mrs serres\r\n\r\nthe attorneygeneral in opposing the claim alleged that the whole\r\nstory of the duke of cumberlands marriage to olive wilmot was a\r\nconcoction from beginning to end and said that the mere statement of\r\nthe petitioners case was sufficient to stamp its true character that\r\nits folly and absurdity were equal to its audacity in every stage\r\nit exposed itself to conviction by the simplest tests he added that\r\nthe petitioner might have dwelt so long upon documents produced and\r\nfabricated by others that with her memory impaired by old age the\r\nprinciple of veracity might have been poisoned and the offices of\r\nimagination and memory confounded to such an extent that she really\r\nbelieved that things had been done and said in her presence which were\r\nin fact entirely imaginary no part of her story was corroborated\r\nby a single authentic document or by a single extrinsic fact the\r\nforgery falsehood and fraud of the case were proved in many ways the\r\nexplanations were as false and feeble as the story itself i cannot\r\nof course he said lay bare the whole history of the concoction\r\nof these extraordinary documents but there are circumstances which\r\nindicate that they were concocted by mrs serres herself\r\n\r\nhaving commented on some other matters spoken of but regarding which\r\nno evidence was adduced he proceeded to speak of the alleged wife of\r\njoseph wilmot d d the polish princess sister of count poniatowski\r\nafterwards elected king of poland  who was the mother of his\r\ncharming daughter olive the truth is said sir roundell that\r\nboth the polish princess and the charming daughter were pure myths\r\nno such persons ever existedthey were as entirely creatures of the\r\nimagination as shakespeares ferdinand and miranda\r\n\r\nas to the documents produced by the petitioners he remarked\r\n\r\n    what sort of documents were those which were produced the\r\n    internal evidence proved that they were the most ridiculous\r\n    absurd preposterous series of forgeries that the perverted\r\n    ingenuity of man ever invented  they were all written on\r\n    little scraps and slips of paper such as no human being would\r\n    ever have used for the purpose of recording transactions of this\r\n    kind and it would be proved that in every one of these pieces of\r\n    paper the watermark of date was wanting\r\n\r\nthis was but a new variant of the remark made by the lord chief\r\njustice just after the puttingin of the alleged marriage certificate\r\nof the prince of wales and hannah lightfoot\r\n\r\n    the court is as i understand asked solemnly to declare on the\r\n    strength of two certificates coming i know not whence written\r\n    on two scraps of paper that the marriage the only marriage of\r\n    george iii which the world believes to have taken place between\r\n    his majesty and queen charlotte was an invalid marriage and\r\n    consequently that all the sovereigns who have sat on the throne\r\n    since his death including her present majesty were not entitled\r\n    to sit on the throne that is the conclusion which the court is\r\n    asked to come to upon these two rubbishy pieces of paper one\r\n    signed george p and the other george guelph i believe them\r\n    to be gross and rank forgeries the court has no difficulty in\r\n    coming to the conclusion even assuming that the signatures had\r\n    that character of genuineness which they have not that what is\r\n    asserted in these documents has not the slightest foundation in\r\n    fact\r\n\r\nwith this view the lord chief baron and the judgeordinary entirely\r\nconcurred the former adding\r\n\r\n     the declarations of hannah lightfoot if there ever was such\r\n    a person cannot be received in evidence on the faith of these\r\n    documents  the only issues for the jury are the issues in the\r\n    cause and this is not an issue in the cause but an incidental\r\n    issue i think that these documents which the lord chief\r\n    justice has treated with all the respect which properly belongs\r\n    to them are not genuine\r\n\r\nbefore the attorney general had finished the statement of his case he\r\nwas interrupted by the foreman of the jury who said that the jury were\r\nunanimously of opinion that there was no necessity to hear any further\r\nevidence as they were convinced that the signatures of the documents\r\nwere not genuine on this the lord chief justice said\r\n\r\n    you share the opinion which my learned brothers and i have\r\n    entertained for a long time that every one of the documents is\r\n    spurious\r\n\r\nas the counsel for the petitioners had felt it his duty to make some\r\nobservations to the jury before they delivered their verdict and had\r\nmade them the lord chief justice summed up towards the conclusion of\r\nhis summingup he said in speaking of the various conflicting stories\r\nput forth by mrs serres\r\n\r\n    in each of the claims which she made at different times she\r\n    appealed to documents in her possession by which they were\r\n    supported what was the irresistible inference why that\r\n    documents were from time to time prepared to meet the form which\r\n    her claims from time to time assumed\r\n\r\nthe jury without hesitation found that they were not satisfied that\r\nolive serres the mother of mrs ryves was the legitimate daughter of\r\nhenry frederick duke of cumberland and olive his wife and they were\r\nnot satisfied that henry frederick duke of cumberland was lawfully\r\nmarried to olive wilmot on the th of march \r\n\r\nthe case of mrs serres is an instance of how a person otherwise\r\ncomparatively harmless but afflicted with vanity and egotism may be\r\nled away into evil courses from which had she realised their full\r\niniquity she might have shrunk the only thing outside the case we\r\nhave been considering was that she separated from her husband which\r\nindeed was an affliction rather than a crime she had been married\r\nfor thirteen years and had borne two children but so far as we know\r\nno impropriety was ever alleged against her one of her daughters\r\nremained her constant companion till her twentysecond year and through\r\nher long life held her and her memory in filial devotion and respect\r\nthe forethought labour and invention which she devoted to the fraud\r\nif properly and honestly used might have won for her a noteworthy\r\nplace in the history of her time but as it was she frittered away in\r\ncriminal work her good opportunities and great talents and ended her\r\nlife within the rules of the kings bench\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nii practitioners of magic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparacelsus\r\n\r\n\r\ni feel that i ought to begin this record with an apology to the manes\r\nof a great and fearless scholar as earnest as he was honest as\r\nopenminded as he was greathearted i do so because i wish to do what\r\nan unimportant man can after the lapse of centuries to help a younger\r\ngeneration to understand what such a man as i write of can do and did\r\nunder circumstances not possible in times of greater enlightenment\r\nthe lesson which the story can tell to thinking youth cannot be told\r\nin vain the greatest asset which worth has in this world is the\r\nirony of time contemporaneous opinion though often correct is\r\ngenerally on the meagre side of appreciationpractically always so\r\nwith regard to anything new such must in any case be encountered in\r\nmatters of the sixteenth century which being on the further side of\r\nan age of discovery and reform had hardened almost to the stage of\r\nossification the beliefs and methods of the outgoing order of things\r\nprejudiceespecially when it is based on science and religiondies\r\nhard the very spirit whence originates a stage of progress or reform\r\nmakes its inherited follower tenacious of its traditions however\r\nshort they may be this is why any who in this later and more open\r\nminded age may investigate the intellectual discoveries of the past\r\nowe a special debt in the way of justice to the memories of those to\r\nwhom such fresh light is due the name and story of the individual\r\nknown as paracelsusscholar scientist open minded thinker and\r\nteacher earnest investigator and searcher for elemental truthsis\r\na case in point anyone who contents himself with accepting the\r\njudgment of four centuries passed upon the great swiss thinker who\r\nhad rendered famous in history his place of birth his canton and his\r\nnation would inevitably come to the conclusion that he was merely a\r\ncharlatan a little more clever than others of his kind an acceptor of\r\nall manner of eccentric beliefs including the efficacy of spirits and\r\ndemons in pathological cases a drunkard a wastrel an evil liver\r\na practiser of necromancy an astrologer a magician an atheist\r\nan alchemistindeed an ist of all defamatory kinds within the\r\nterminology of the sixteenth century and of all disputatious churchmen\r\nand scientists who have not agreed with his theories and conclusions\r\never since\r\n\r\nlet us begin with the facts of his life his name was theophrastus\r\nbombast von hohenheim and he was the son of a doctor living in\r\neinsiedeln in the canton of schwyz named wilhelm bombast von\r\nhohenheim natural son of a grand master of the teutonic order he\r\nwas born in  it was not uncommon for a man of that age who was\r\nstriving to make a name for himself to assume some nom de plume\r\nor de guerre and with such a family record as his own it was no\r\nwonder that on the threshold of his life the young theophrastus did so\r\nin the light of his later achievements we can well imagine that he\r\nhad some definite purpose in mind or at least some guiding principle\r\nof suggestiveness in choosing such a compound word from the greek\r\nas paracelsus which is derived from para meaning before in the\r\nsense of superior to and celsus the name of an epicurean philosopher\r\nof the second century celsus appears to have had views of great\r\nenlightenment according to the thought of his own time unhappily only\r\nfragments of his work remain but as he was a follower of epicurus\r\nafter an interval of between four and five centuries it is possible\r\nto get some idea of his main propositions like epicurus he stood for\r\nnature he did not believe in fatalism but he did in a supreme power\r\nhe was a platonist and held that there was no truth which was against\r\nnature it is easy to see from his life and work that theophrastus\r\nbombast von hohenheim shared his views his intellectual attitude\r\nwas that of a true scientistdenying nothing prima facie but\r\ninvestigating all\r\n\r\n    there lives more faith in honest doubt\r\n    believe me than in half the creeds\r\n\r\nhis father moved in  to villach in carinthia where he practised\r\nmedicine till his death in  theophrastus was a precocious boy\r\nafter youthful study with his father he entered the university of\r\nbasel when he was about sixteen after which he prosecuted chemical\r\nresearches under the learned trithemius bishop of sponheim who had\r\nwritten on the subject of the great elixirthe common subject\r\nof the scientists of that dayand at wurzburg from thence he\r\nproceeded to the great mines in the tyrol then belonging to the\r\nfugger family here he studied geology and its kindred branches of\r\nlearningespecially those dealing with effects and so far as possible\r\nwith causesmetallurgy mineral waters and the diseases of and\r\naccidents to mines and miners the theory of knowledge which he deduced\r\nfrom these studies was that we must learn nature from nature\r\n\r\nin  he returned to basel where he was appointed town physician\r\nit was a characteristic of his independence and of his mind method\r\nand design that he lectured in the language of the place german\r\nforegoing the latin tongue usual up to that time for such teaching\r\nhe did not shrink from a bold criticism of the medical ideas and\r\nmethods then current the effect of this independence and teaching was\r\nthat for a couple of years his reputation and his practice increased\r\nwonderfully but the time thus passed allowed his enemies not only\r\nto see the danger for them that lay ahead but to take such action\r\nas they could to obviate it reactionary forces are generallyif\r\nnot alwaysselfprotective without regard to the right or wrong\r\nof the matter and paracelsus began to find that the selfinterest\r\nand ignorance of the many were too strong for him and that their\r\nunscrupulous attacks began to injure his work seriously he was called\r\nconjurer necromancer and many such terms of obloquy then what we may\r\ncall his professional enemies felt themselves strong enough to join\r\nin the attack as he had kept a careful eye on the purity of medicines\r\nin use the apothecaries who in those days worked in a smaller field\r\nthan now and who found their commerce more productive through guile\r\nthan excellence became almost declared opponents eventually he had to\r\nleave basel he went to esslingen from which however he had to retire\r\nat no distant period from sheer want\r\n\r\nthen began a period of wandering which really lasted for the last dozen\r\nyears of his life this time was mainly one of learning in many ways\r\nof many things the ground he covered must have been immense for he\r\nvisited colmar nurnberg appengall zurich augsburg middelheim\r\nand travelled in prussia austria hungary egypt turkey russia\r\ntartary italy the low countries and denmark in germany and hungary\r\nhe had a bad time being driven to supply even the bare necessaries of\r\nlife by oddanymeans even to availing himself of the credulity\r\nof otherscasting nativities telling fortunes prescribing remedies\r\nfor animals of the farm such as cows and pigs and recovering stolen\r\nproperty such a life indeed as was the lot of a mediæval tramp on\r\nthe other hand as a contra he did worthy work as a military surgeon\r\nin italy the low countries and denmark when he got tired of his\r\nwandering life he settled down in salsburg in  under the care\r\nand protection of the archbishop ernst but he did not long survive\r\nthe prospect of rest he died later in the same year the cause of his\r\ndeath is not known with any certainty but we can guess that he had\r\nclamorous enemies as well as strong upholding from the conflicting\r\ncauses given some said that he died from the effects of a protracted\r\ndebauch others that he was murdered by physicians and apothecaries or\r\ntheir agents who had thrown him over a cliff in proof of this story\r\nit was said that the surgeons had found a flaw or fracture in his skull\r\nwhich must have been produced during life\r\n\r\nhe was buried in the churchyard of saint sebastian but two centuries\r\nlater  his bones were moved to the porch of the church and a\r\nmonument erected over them\r\n\r\nhis first book was printed in augsburg in  his real monument\r\nwas the collection of his complete writings so far as was possible\r\nthe long work of johann huser made in  this great work was\r\npublished in german from printed copy supplemented by such manuscript\r\nas could be discovered then and ever since there has been a perpetual\r\nrain of statements against him and his beliefs most of them are too\r\nsilly for words but it is a little disconcerting to find one writer of\r\nsome distinction repeating so late as  all the malignant twaddle\r\nof three centuries saying amongst other things that he believed in\r\nthe transmutation of metals and the possibility of an elixir vitæ\r\nthat he boasted of having spirits at his command one of which he\r\nkept imprisoned in the hilt of his sword and another in a jewel that\r\nhe could make any one live forever that he was proud to be called a\r\nmagician and had boasted of having a regular correspondence with galen\r\nin hell we read in sensational journals and magazines of today about\r\ncertain living persons havingor saying that they havecommunion in\r\nthe shape of interviews with the dead but this is too busy an age\r\nfor unnecessary contradictions and so such assertions are allowed to\r\npass the same indifference may now and again have been exhibited in\r\nthe case of men like paracelsus\r\n\r\nsome things said of him may be accepted as being partially true for\r\nhis was an age of mysticism occultism astrology and all manner of\r\nstrange and weird beliefs for instance it is alleged that he held that\r\nlife is an emanation from the stars that the sun governed the heart\r\nthe moon the brain jupiter the liver saturn the gall mercury the\r\nlungs mars the bile venus the loins that in each stomach is a demon\r\nthat the belly is the grand laboratory where all the ingredients are\r\napportioned and mixed and that gold could cure ossification of the\r\nheart\r\n\r\nis it any wonder that when in this age after centuries of progress such\r\nabsurd things are current paracelsus is shewn in contemporary and later\r\nportraits with a jewel in his hand transcribed azoththe name given to\r\nhis familiar dæmon\r\n\r\nthose who repeat ad nauseam the absurd stories of his alchemy\r\ngenerally omit to mention his genuine discoveries and to tell of the\r\nwide scope of his teaching that he used mercury and opium for healing\r\npurposes at a time when they were condemned that he did all he could\r\nto stop the practice of administering the vile electuaries of the\r\nmediæval pharmacopœia that he was one of the first to use laudanum\r\nthat he perpetually heldto his own detrimentthat medical science\r\nshould not be secret that he blamed strongly the fashion of his time\r\nof accounting for natural phenomena by the intervention of spirits or\r\noccult forces that he deprecated astrology that he insisted on the\r\nproper investigation of the properties of drugs and that they should be\r\nused more simply and in smaller doses to these benefits and reforms\r\nhis enemies answered that he had made a pact with the devil for reward\r\nof his labours his genius his fearless struggle for human good he\r\nhadwith the exception of a few spells of prosperityonly penury\r\nwant malicious illfame and ceaseless attacks by the professors of\r\nreligion and science he was an original investigator of open mind\r\nof great ability and application and absolutely fearless he was\r\ncenturies ahead of his time we can all feel grateful to that french\r\nwriter who

beyond her time for a hundred years afterwards we find\r\nso levelheaded a writer as dr charles mackay crediting her quite\r\nunwarrantably with amongst other good qualities being a faithful\r\nwife her life certainly after her marriage was such that faithfulness\r\nin any form was one of the last things to expect in her her husband\r\nwas nothing less than a swindler of a protean kind he had had a great\r\nnumber of aliases before he finally fixed on comte de cagliostro as\r\na nomme de guerre he called himself successively chevalier de\r\nfischio marquis de melina or melissa marquis de pellegrini comte\r\nde saintgerman baron de belmonte together with such names as fenix\r\nanna harat he wrote a work somewhat of the nature of a novel called\r\nle grand cophtewhich he found useful later when he was pushing his\r\nscheme of a sort of new freemasonry after his marriage he visited\r\nseveral countries egypt arabia persia poland russia greece\r\ngermany as well as such towns as naples palermo rhodes strasbourg\r\nparis london lisbon vienna venice madrid brusselsin fact any\r\nplace where many fools were crowded into a small space in many of\r\nthese he found use for the introductory letters of the grand master\r\nof the knights of malta as well as those of other dupes from whom it\r\nwas his habit to secure such letters before the inevitable crash came\r\nwherever he travelled he was accustomed to learn all he could of the\r\nmanners customs and facts of each place he was in thus accumulating\r\na vast stock of a certain form of knowledge which he found most useful\r\nin his chosen occupationdeceit with regard to the last he utilised\r\nevery form of human credulity which came under his notice the latter\r\nhalf of the eighteenth century was the very chosen time of strange\r\nbeliefs occultism became a fashion especially amongst the richer\r\nclasses with the result that every form of swindle came to the fore\r\nat this time cagliostro then nearing his fortieth year began to have\r\na widespread reputation for marvellous cures as mysticism in all sorts\r\nof forms had a vogue he used all the tricks of the cult gathering\r\nthem from various countries especially france and germany where the\r\nfashion was pronounced for this trickery he used all his knowledge of\r\nthe east and all the picturesque aids to credulity which he had picked\r\nup during his years of wandering and for his patter such medical\r\nterminology as he had learnedhe either became a doctor or invented\r\na title for himself this he interlarded with scraps of various forms\r\nof fraudulent occultism and all sorts of suggestive images of eastern\r\nquasireligious profligacy he took much of the imagery which he used\r\nin his rituals of fraud from records of ancient egypt this was a\r\npretty safe ground for his purpose for in his time the egypt of the\r\npast was a sealed book it was only in  that the rosetta stone\r\nwas discovered and more than ten years from then before dr young was\r\nable to translate its three inscriptionshieroglyphic demotic and\r\ngreekwhence hieroglyphic knowledge had its source omne ignotum\r\npro magnifico might well serve as a motto for all occultism true\r\nor false cagliostro whose business it was to deceive and mislead\r\nunderstood this and took care that in his cabalistic forms egyptian\r\nsigns were largely mixed with the pentagon the signs of the zodiac\r\nand other mysterious symbols in common use his object was primarily\r\nto catch the eye and so arrest the intelligence of any whom he wished\r\nto impress for this purpose he went about gorgeously dressed and with\r\nimpressive appointments in germany for instance he always drove in\r\na carriage with four horses with courier and equerries in striking\r\nliveries happily there is extant a pen picture of him by comte de\r\nbeugnot who met him in paris at the house of the comtesse de la motte\r\n\r\n    of medium height and fairly fat of olive colour with short\r\n    neck and round face big protruberant eyes a snub nose with open\r\n    nostrils\r\n\r\nthis gives of him anything but an attractive picture but yet m de\r\nbeugnot says he made an impression on women whenever he came into a\r\nroom perhaps his clothing helped for it was not of a commonplace\r\nkind de beugnot who was manifestly a careful and intelligent observer\r\nagain comes to our aid with his pen\r\n\r\n    he wore a coiffure new in france his hair parted in several\r\n    little cadenottes queues or tresses uniting at the back of the\r\n    head in the form known as a catogan hair clubbed or bunched\r\n    a dress french fashion of iron grey laced with gold scarlet\r\n    waistcoat broidered with bold point de spain red breeches a\r\n    baskethilted sword and a hat with white plumes\r\n\r\naided by these adjuncts he was a great success in paris whither he\r\nreturned in  as an impostor he knew his business and played the\r\ngame well when he was at work he brought to bear the influence of all\r\nhis properties amongst them a tablecloth embroidered with cabalistic\r\nsigns in scarlet and the symbols of the rosy cross of high degree the\r\nsame mysterious emblems marked the globe without which no wizards\r\natelier is complete\r\n\r\nhere too were various little egyptian figuresushabtui he would\r\ndoubtless have called them had the word been in use in his day from\r\nthese he kept his dupes at a distance guarding carefully against\r\nany discovery he evidently did not fear to hurt the religious\r\nsusceptibilities of any of his votaries for not only were the crucifix\r\nand other emblems of the kind placed amongst the curios of his ritual\r\nbut he made his invocation in the form of a religious ceremony going\r\ndown on his knees and in all ways cultivating the emotions of those\r\nround him he was aided by a young woman whom he described as pure\r\nas an angel and of great sensibility the said young person kept\r\nher blue eyes fixed on a globe full of water then he proceeded to\r\nexpound the great secret which he told his hearers had been the same\r\nsince the beginning of things and whose mystery had been guarded by\r\ntemplars of the rosy cross by magicians by egyptians and the like\r\nhe had claimed as the comte saintgerman said that he had already\r\nexisted for many centuries that he was a contemporary of christ and\r\nthat he had predicted his crucifixion by the jews as statements of\r\nthis kind were made mainly for the purpose of selling the elixir which\r\nhe peddled it may easily be imagined that he did not shrink from\r\nlying or blasphemy when such seemed to suit his purpose daring and\r\nrecklessness in his statements seemed to further his business success\r\nso prophecyor rather boastings of prophecy after the eventbecame\r\npart of the great fraud amongst other things he said that he had\r\npredicted the taking of the bastille such things shed a little light\r\non the methods of such impostors and help to lay bare the roots or\r\nprinciples through which they flourish\r\n\r\nafter his parisian success he made a prolonged tour in france in la\r\nvendée he boasted of some fresh miracleof his own doingon each day\r\nand at lyons the boasting was repeated of course he occasionally had\r\nbad times for now and again even the demons on whose acquaintance and\r\nhelp he prided himself did not work in london after  things had\r\nbecome so bad with him that he had to work as a house painter under\r\nhis own name whatever may have been his skill in his art this was\r\nprobably about the only honest work he ever did he did not stick to\r\nit for long however for four years afterwards he lost three thousand\r\npounds by frauds of others by whom he was introduced to fictitious\r\nlords and ladies here too he underwent a term of imprisonment for debt\r\n\r\nnaturally such an impostor found in freemasonry which is a secret\r\ncult a way of furthering his ends with the aid of his wife who all\r\nthrough their life together seems to have worked with him he founded a\r\nnew branch of freemasonry in which a good many rules of that wonderful\r\norganisation were set at defiance as the purpose of the new cult was\r\nto defraud its net was enlarged by taking women into the body the\r\nname used for it was the grand egyptian lodgehe being himself the\r\nhead of it under the title of the cophte and his wife the grand\r\npriestess in the ritual were some appalling ceremonies and as these\r\nmade eventually for profitable publicity the scheme was a great\r\nsuccessand the elixir sold well this elixir was the backbone of\r\nhis revenue and indeed it would have been well worthy of success if\r\nit had been all that he claimed for it dispensers of elixirs are not\r\nusually backward in proclaiming the virtues of their wares but in his\r\nvarious settings forth cagliostro went further than others he claimed\r\nnot only to restore youth and health and to make them perpetual\r\nbut to restore lost innocence and effect a whole moral regeneration\r\nno wonder that he achieved success and that money rolled in and no\r\nwonder that women especially of the upper classes followed him like\r\na flock of sheep no wonder that a class rich idle pleasureloving\r\nand fond of tasting and testing new sensations found thrilling moments\r\nin the great impostors mélange of mystery religion fear and hope\r\nof spiritrapping and a sort of black mass in which christianity\r\nand paganism mingled freely and where life and death good and evil\r\nwhirled together in a maddening dance\r\n\r\nit was not however through his alleged sorcery that cagliostro crept\r\ninto a place in history but by the association of his name with a\r\nsordid crime which involved the names of some of the great ones of the\r\nearth the story of the queens necklace though he was acquitted at\r\nthe trial which concluded it will be remembered when the vapourings\r\nof the unscrupulous quack who had escaped a thousand penalties justly\r\nearned have been long forgotten such is the irony of history the\r\nstory of the necklace involved marie antoinette cardinal prince de\r\nrohan comte de la mottean officer of the private guard of monsieur\r\nthe comte dartois his wife jeanne de valois descended from henry\r\nii through saintremy his natural son and nicole de savigny louis xv\r\nhad ordered from mm boemer et bassange jewellers to the court of\r\nfrance a beautiful necklace of extraordinary value for his mistress\r\nmadame du barry but died before it was completed the du barry was\r\nexiled by his successor so the necklace remained on the hands of its\r\nmakers it was however of so great intrinsic value that they could\r\nnot easily find a purchaser they offered it to marie antoinette for\r\none million eight hundred thousand livres but the price was too\r\nhigh even for a queen and the necklace remained on hand so boemer\r\nshowed it to madame de la motte and offered to give a commission on\r\nthe sale to whoever should find a buyer she induced her husband\r\ncomte de la motte to join with her in a plot to accomplish the sale\r\nde la motte was a friend of cagliostro and he too was brought in as\r\nhe had influence with the cardinal prince de rohan whom they looked\r\non as a likely person to be of service he had his own ambitions to\r\nacquire influence over the queen and use her for political purposes as\r\nmazarin had used anne of austria de rohan was then a man of fiftynot\r\nconsidered much of an age in these days but the cardinals life had\r\nnot made for comparative longevity he was in fact something of that\r\nclass of fool which has no peer in follyan old fool and jeanne\r\nde la motte fooled him to the top of his bent she pretended to him\r\nthat marie antoinette was especially friendly to her and shewed him\r\nletters from the queen to herself all of which had been forged for the\r\npurpose as at this time madame de la motte had borrowed or otherwise\r\nobtained from the cardinal a hundred and twenty thousand livres she\r\nfelt assured he could be used for the contemplated fraud she probably\r\nhad not ever even spoken to the queen but she was not scrupulous in\r\nsuch a small matter as one more untruth she finally persuaded him that\r\nmarie antoinette wished to purchase the necklace through his agency he\r\nacting for her and buying it in her name to aid in the scheme she got\r\nher pet forger retaux de vilette to prepare a receipt signed marie\r\nantoinette de france the cardinal fell into the trap and obtained\r\nthe jewel giving to boemer four bills due successively at intervals\r\nof six months at versailles de rohan gave the casket containing the\r\nnecklace to madame de la motte who in his presence handed it to a\r\nvalet of the royal household for conveyance to the queen the valet\r\nwas none other than the forger retaux de vilette madame de la motte\r\nsent to the cardinal a letter by the same forger asking him to meet her\r\nthe queen in the shrubbery at versailles between eleven oclock and\r\nmidnight to complete the deception a girl was procured one olivia\r\nwho in figure resembled the queen sufficiently to pass for her in the\r\ndusk the meeting between de rohan and the alleged queen was held at\r\nthe baths of apolloto the deception and temporary satisfaction of the\r\nambitious churchman when the first instalment for the purchase of the\r\nnecklace was due boemer tried to find out if the queen really had\r\npossession of the necklacewhich had in the meanwhile been brought to\r\nlondon it was said by comte de la motte as boemer could not manage\r\nto get an audience with the queen he came to the conclusion that he\r\nhad been robbed and made the matter public this was reported to\r\nm de breteuil master of the kings household and an enemy of de\r\nrohan de breteuil saw the queen secretly and they agreed to act in\r\nconcert in the matter louis xvi asked for details of the purchase\r\nfrom boemer who told the truth so far as he knew it producing as a\r\nproof the alleged receipt of the queen louis pointed out to him that\r\nhe should have known that the queen did not sign after the manner of\r\nthe document he then asked de rohan who was grand almoner of france\r\nfor his written justification this being supplied he had him arrested\r\nand sent to the bastille madame de la motte accused cagliostro of the\r\ncrime alleging that he had persuaded de rohan to buy the necklace she\r\nwas also arrested as were retaux de vilette and later on at brussels\r\nolivia who threw some light on the fraud the king brought the whole\r\nmatter before parliament which ordered a prosecution as the result of\r\nthe trial which followed comte de la motte and retaux de vilette were\r\nbanished for life jeanne de la motte was condemned to make amende\r\nhonourable to be whipped and branded with v on both shoulders and\r\nto be imprisoned for life olivia and cagliostro were acquitted the\r\ncardinal was cleared of all charges nothing seems to have been done\r\nfor the poor jewellers who after all had received more substantial\r\ninjury than any of the others having lost nearly two million livres\r\n\r\nafter the affair of the necklace cagliostro spent a time in the\r\nbastille and when free after some months he and his wife travelled\r\nagain in europe in  he was arrested at rome by order of the\r\ninquisition and condemned to death as a freemason the punishment was\r\nlater commuted to perpetual imprisonment he ended his days in the\r\nchâteau de saintleon near rome his wife was condemned to perpetual\r\nseclusion and died in the convent of sainteappolive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmesmer\r\n\r\n\r\nalthough fredericantoine mesmer made an astonishing discovery which\r\nhaving been tested and employed in therapeutics for a century is\r\naccepted as a contribution to science he is included in the list of\r\nimpostors because however sound his theory was he used it in the\r\nmanner or surrounded with the atmosphere of imposture indeed the\r\nimplement which he used in his practice and which made him famous in\r\nfashionable and idle society was set forth as having magic properties\r\nhe belonged to the same period as cagliostro having been born but nine\r\nyears before him in  in itzmang suabia but the impostor pure\r\nand simple easily picked up the difference by beginning his lifework\r\nearlier and following it quicker with regard to results mesmer was not\r\nin any sense a precocious person he was thirtytwo years of age when\r\nhe took his degree of doctor of medicine at vienna in  however\r\nhe had already chosen his subject animal magnetism as allied with\r\nmedical therapeutics his early script under the title de planetarum\r\ninfluxi is looked on as a legal reminiscence of judicial astronomy he\r\nleft vienna because he said of a cabal against him and travelled\r\nin europe particularly in switzerland before he went to paris to\r\nseek his fortune this was in  when he was some fortyfour years\r\nof age his reputation which had been growing all the time preceded\r\nhim he was then a man of fine appearance tall and importantlooking\r\nand conveying a sense of calm power he produced much sensation and was\r\nat once creditednot without his own will or intentionwith magic\r\npower he posed as a benefactor of humanity a position which was at\r\nonce conceded to him partly owing to the fact that an extraordinary\r\natmosphere of calm seemed to surround him which with his natural\r\nair of assurance founded on selfbelief was able to convey to his\r\npatients a sense of hope which was of course very helpful in cases of\r\nnervous failure and depression he settled in the hotel bouret near the\r\nplace vendôme and so in the heart of paris and at once undertook the\r\ntreatment of patients hitherto deemed incurable fashion took up the\r\nnew medical craze or sensation and he at once became the vogue\r\nit was at this time of his life that mesmer came to the parting of\r\nthe ways between earnest science and charlatanism so far as we know\r\nhe still remained earnest in his scientific beliefas indeed he was\r\ntill the end of his days inasmuch as fashion requires some concrete\r\nexpression of its fancies mesmer soon used the picturesque side of\r\nhis brain for the service of fashionable success so he invented an\r\nappliance which soon became the talk of the town this was the famous\r\nbaquet magique or magic tub a sort of covered bath round which his\r\npatients were arranged in tiers to the bath were attached a number\r\nof tubes each of which was held by a patient who could touch with\r\nthe end of it any part of his or her body at will after a while the\r\npatients began to get excited and many of them went into convulsions\r\namongst them walked mesmer clad in an imposing dress suggestive of\r\nmystery and carrying a long wand of alleged magic power often calming\r\nthose who had already reached the stage of being actually convulsed\r\nhis usual method of producing something of the same effect at private\r\nséances was by holding the hand of the patient touching the forehead\r\nand making passes with the open hand with fingers spread out and by\r\ncrossing and uncrossing his arms with great rapidity\r\n\r\na wellattended séance must have been a curious and not altogether\r\npleasant experience even to a wholesome spectator in full possession\r\nof his natural faculties the whole surroundings of the place\r\ntogether with the previously cultured belief the dusk and mystery\r\nthe mysterious sympathy of numbersas dean farrar called it the\r\nspasmodic snapping of the cords of tensity which took away all traces\r\nof reserve or reticence from the men and women present the vague\r\nterror of the unknown that mysterious apprehension which is so potent\r\nwith the nerves of weak or imaginative people and it may be the\r\nslipping of the dogs of conscienceall these combined to wreck the\r\nmoral and mental stability of those present most of whom it must be\r\nremembered were actually ill or imagined themselves to be so which\r\ncame practically to the same thing the psychical emotion was all very\r\nwell in the world of pleasure but these creatures became physically\r\nsick through nervous strain as described by the historian they\r\nexpectorated freely a viscous fluid and their sickness passed into\r\nconvulsions more or less violent the women naturally succumbing more\r\nreadily and more quickly than the men this absolute collapsehalf\r\nepileptic half hystericallasted varying periods according to the\r\ninfluence exercised by the presence of the calm selfreliant operator\r\nwe of a later age when electric force has been satisfactorily\r\nharnessed and when magnetism as a separate power is better understood\r\nmay find it hard to understand that the most advanced and daring\r\nscientists of the timeto whom fredericantoine mesmer was at least\r\nalliedwere satisfied that magnetism and electricity were variants\r\nof the same mysterious force or power it was on this theory that he\r\nseems to have worked his main idea to practical effect the base of his\r\nsystem was animal magnetism which could be superinduced or aided by\r\nmechanical appliances he did not deceive himself into believing that\r\nhe had invented the idea but was quite willing to make the utmost use\r\nhe could of the discoveries and inventions of others so far as we can\r\ngather his intentions from his acts the main object in his scientific\r\nwork was to simplify the processes of turning emotion into effect\r\nmagnetism had already been largely studied and means were being\r\nconstantly sought for increasing its efficacy father hehl had brought\r\nto a point of accepted perfection the manufacture of metal plates\r\nused in magnetic development and these mesmer used with the result\r\nthat a violent controversy took place between them so far as we can\r\nfollow after the lapse of time mesmer was consistent in his theories\r\nand their application he held that the principle was one of planetary\r\ninfluence on the nervous system and its manifestation was by a process\r\nof alternate intension and remission it is possible that mesmerwho\r\nheld that the heavenly bodies floated in a limitless magnetic fluid and\r\nthat he could make all substances even such things as bread or dogs\r\nmagnetichad in his mind the wisdom of following the same theory in\r\nmatters of lesser significance though of more individual import than\r\nthose of astronomy and its correlated sciences if so he was wise in\r\nhis generation for later electricians have found that the system of\r\nalternating currents especially at high tension is of vast practical\r\nimportance that he was practical in his use of the ideas of others\r\nis shown by the fact that he preferred the metallic plates of father\r\nhehl to his own passes even though the report of the royal commission\r\nruined himat any rate checked his success by stating that similar\r\neffects to those attending his passes could be produced by other\r\nmeans and that such passes had no effect unless through the patients\r\nknowledge in fact that it was all the work of imagination mesmer had\r\nbeen asked to appear before the commission of the faculty of medicine\r\nappointed in  to investigate and report but he kept away it would\r\nnot have injured any man to have appeared before such a commission if\r\nhis cause had been a good one there were two such commissions the\r\nfirst was of the leading physicians of paris and included such men\r\nas benjamin franklin lavoisier the great chemist and bailly the\r\nhistorian of astronomy\r\n\r\nit was distinctly to his disadvantage that mesmer always kept at a\r\ndistance the whole corps of savants such as the faculty of medicine\r\nand the academy of sciencesfor they would no doubt have accepted\r\nhis views visionary though they were if he could have shown any\r\nscientific base for them true medical science has always been\r\nsuspicious of and cautious regarding empiricism more than once he\r\nstood in his own light in this matterwhether through obstinacy or\r\ndoubt of his own theory does not matter for instance in vienna\r\nwhen his very existence as a scientist was at stake in the matter of\r\nthe effects of his treatment of mademoiselle paradis he introduced a\r\nhumiliating clause in his challenge to the faculty which caused them\r\nto refuse to accept it mademoiselle paradis was blind and subject\r\nto convulsions after treating her by his own method mesmer said she\r\nwas cured an oculist said after testing that she was as blind as\r\never and her family said that she was still subject to convulsions\r\nbut mesmer persisted that she was cured that there was a conspiracy\r\nagainst him and that mademoiselle paradis had feigned he challenged\r\nthe faculty of medicine on the subject of his discovery twentyfour\r\npatients were to be selected by the faculty of these twelve were to be\r\ntreated by mesmerism and the other half by the means ordinarily in use\r\nthe condition he imposed was that the witnesses were not to be of the\r\nfaculty\r\n\r\nagain when in answer to a request on his part that the french\r\ngovernment for the good of the community should subsidise him a\r\nproposal was made to him he did not receive it favourably the request\r\nhe made to marie antoinette was that he should have an estate and\r\nchâteau and a handsome income so that he might go on experimenting he\r\nput the broad figures at four hundred or five hundred thousand francs\r\nthe government suggestion was that he should have a pension of twenty\r\nthousand francs and the cross of saint michael knighthood if he would\r\ncommunicate for public use to a board of physicians nominated by the\r\nking such discoveries as he might make after his refusal of the\r\ngovernment proposition mesmer went to spa taking with him a number\r\nof his patients and there opened a magnetic establishment where he\r\nrenewed his paris success he asked parliament to hold an impartial\r\nexamination into the theory and working of animal magnetism foiled in\r\nhis scheme of state purchase on his own terms he sold his secret to a\r\ngroup of societies the members of which were to pay him a subscription\r\nof a hundred louis per capita by this means he realised some \r\nlivresrepresenting today over a million the associated body was\r\ncomposed of twentyfour societies called societés de lharmoniea\r\nsort of freemasonry under a grand master and chiefs of the order a\r\nmember had to be at the time of admission twentyfive years of age of\r\nhonest state and good name not to smoke tobacco and to pay an annual\r\nsubscription of at least sixty francs there were three grades in the\r\norder initiated associates corresponding associates and uninitiated\r\namongst those belonging to the society were such men as lafayette\r\ndespremisnil and berthollet the great chemist berthollet had\r\nhowever peculiar privileges amongst which was the right of criticism\r\non one occasion he had a row with mesmer about his charlatanism\r\n\r\nat length the french public wearied with his trickeries and angry with\r\nhis cupidity openly expressed their dissatisfaction whereupon he left\r\nfrance taking with him a fortune of three hundred and forty thousand\r\nfrancs he went to england and thence to germany finally he settled\r\ndown in mersbourg in his native country suabia where he died in \r\nat the age of eightyone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niii the wandering jew\r\n\r\n\r\nthe legend of the wandering jew has its roots in a belief in the\r\npossibility of human longevity beyond what is natural and normal it\r\nis connected with the story of the crucifixion and the mysteries that\r\npreceded and followed it our account may find its starting point\r\nin a book of extraordinary interest which made a sensation in the\r\nseventeenth century and is still delightful reading the passage which\r\nshould arrest our attention is as follows\r\n\r\n    the story of the wandering jew is very strange and will hardly\r\n    obtain belief yet there is a small account thereof set down by\r\n    matthew paris from the report of an armenian bishop who came\r\n    into this kingdom about four hundred years ago and had often\r\n    entertained this wanderer at his table that he was then alive\r\n    was first called cartaphilus was keeper of the judgment hall\r\n    whence thrusting out our saviour with expostulation of his stay\r\n    was condemned to stay until his return was after baptized by\r\n    ananias and by the name of joseph was thirty years old in\r\n    the dayes of our saviour remembered the saints that arised\r\n    with him the making of the apostles creed and their several\r\n    peregrinations surely were this true he might be an happy\r\n    arbitrator in many christian controversies but must impardonably\r\n    condemn the obstinacy of the jews who can contemn the rhetorick\r\n    of such miracles and blindly behold so living and lasting\r\n    conversions\r\n\r\nthe above is taken from the work entitled pseudoxia epidemica or\r\nenquiries into very many received tenets and commonly presumed truths\r\nby sir thomas brown knight md this was first published in \r\nso that the about four hundred years ago mentioned would bring the\r\nreport of the armenian bishop to the first half of the thirteenth\r\ncentury\r\n\r\nthus unless there be something of an authoritative character to upset\r\nthe theory matthew paris must be taken as the first european narrator\r\nof the story as a matter of fact the legend began just about the time\r\nthus arrived at the great work in latin historia major was begun\r\nby roger of wendover and completed in  by the monk matthew paris\r\nit was not however publishedin our ordinary sense of the worduntil\r\nthe beginning of the year  when archbishop parker took it in hand\r\nin the meantime the art of printing had been established and the new\r\nworld of thought and the reproduction of its fruit had been developed\r\nfor common use the historia major was again printed in zurich in\r\n and  the next english edition was in  this was reprinted\r\nin paris in  the english edition of forty years later \r\nwas a really fine specimen of typographic art the authorship and\r\ndate of its printing are given matthaei paris monachi albanensis\r\nangli london mdclxxxiv the script is in ecclesiastical latin and\r\nto any modern reader is of a fresh and almost childlike sincerity\r\nwhich at once disarms doubt or hostile criticism indeed it affords\r\na good example of the mechanism of myth showing how the littleness\r\nof human naturevanity with its desire to shine and credulity in its\r\nprimitive form are not subject to the controlling influences of either\r\nsacredness of subject or the rulings of common sense it lends another\r\nmeaning to the quotation of feste the jester cucullus non facit\r\nmonachum the artless narrative recorded in the historia major makes\r\nthe whole inception of the myth transparent in the monastery of st\r\nalbans a conversation is held by the monks on one side and the armenian\r\narchbishopname not given on the other the interpreter in french\r\nis one henri spigurnel a native of antioch servant of the bishop\r\nwe can gather even how sir thomas brown m d doctor of norwich and\r\nmost openminded of scientists lent himself unconsciously to the\r\npropagation of error brown reading or hearing read the work of\r\nmatthew paris took it for granted that the record was correct and\r\ncomplete and in his own book summarises or generalises the statements\r\nmade for instance he says that the armenian bishop had often\r\nentertained this wanderer at his table c now it was his servant\r\nwho told the monks that the wandering jew whom he had seen and heard\r\nspeaking many times dined at the table of his lord the archbishop\r\nthis at once minimises the value of the statement for it does away\r\nat once with the respect due to the bishops high office and presumed\r\ncharacter and with the sense of intellectual acumen and accuracy which\r\nmight be expected to emanate from one of his scholarship and quality\r\nthus we get the story not from an accredited bishop on a foreign\r\nmissionrare at the period and entrusted only to men of notebut from\r\nthe gossip of an armenian lacquey or valet trying to show his own\r\nimportance to a credulous serving brother of the monastery and so\r\nafter all coming from this source it is to be accepted with exceeding\r\ncarenot to say doubt even when seconded by the learned monastic\r\nscribe matthew so also for instance is his statement regarding the\r\nmanner in which the wanderers life is miraculously prolonged it is\r\nto this effect each hundredth year joseph falls into a faint so that\r\nhe lies for a time unconscious when he recovers he finds that his age\r\nis restored to that which it was when the lord suffered joseph it\r\nmust be borne in mind is the wandering jew once cartaphilus who had\r\nkept pilates judgmenthall then matthew himself takes up the story\r\nand gives what professes to be the ipsissima verba of the servant as\r\nto the conversation between christ and cartaphilus which culminated in\r\nthe terrible doom pronounced on the janitor who from the showing did\r\nnot seem a whit worse than any of the crowd present on that momentous\r\nday in jerusalem when jesus wearied already with carrying the great\r\ncross leaned for a moment against the wall of the house of cartaphilus\r\njust opposite the judgmenthall the official said\r\n\r\n    vade jesu citius vade quid moraris et jesus severo vultu et\r\n    oculo respiciens eum dixit ego vado expectabis donec veniam\r\n\r\nnow this is the whole and sole foundation of the individual wandering\r\njew i say individual because there were before long other variants\r\nand many old beliefs and fables were appropriated and used to back up\r\nthe marvellous story invented by the armenian servant and recorded\r\nby the learned monk matthew amongst these beliefs were those\r\nwhich taught that john the baptist never died that the aloe blooms\r\nonly once in a hundred years and that the phœnix renews itself in\r\nfire it is the tendency of legendary beliefs to group or nucleate\r\nthemselves as though there were a conscious and intentional effort at\r\nselfprotection and this together with the natural human tendency to\r\nenlarge and elaborate an accepted idea is responsible for much the\r\nlegend started in the thirteenth century took root and flourished and\r\nin the very beginning of the seventeenth a variant blossomed in this\r\njoseph originally cartaphilus became ahasuerus in the long pause the\r\nstory after the manner of all things of earth had grown details not\r\nbeing lacking the world was informed through the bishop of schleswig\r\nhow in  at hamburg a man was seen in the cathedral who arrested\r\nattentionwhy we are not told he was about fifty years of age of\r\nreverend manner and dressed in ragged clothes he bowed low at the\r\nname of christ many of the nobility and gentry who saw him recognised\r\nhim as one whom they had already seen in various placesengland\r\nfrance italy hungary persia spain poland moscow lieffland\r\nsweden denmark scotland c inquiry being made of him he told the\r\nbishop that he was ahasuerus the shoemaker of jerusalem who had been\r\npresent at the crucifixion and had ever since been always wandering\r\nhe was well posted in history especially regarding the lives and\r\nsufferings of the apostles and told how when he had directed christ\r\nto move on the latter had answered i will stand here and rest but\r\nthou shalt move on till the last day he had been first seen we are\r\ntold at lubeck\r\n\r\nit is strange that in an age of religious domination many of the\r\nlegends of our saviour seem to have been based on just such intolerant\r\nanger at personal slight as might have ruled a shorttempered\r\nvain man for instance look at one of the christ legends which was\r\nreproduced in poor ophelias distracted mind apropos of the owl they\r\nsay the owl was a bakers daughter the gloucestershire legend runs\r\nthat christ having asked for bread at baking time the mistress of the\r\nbakery took dough from the oven but her daughter having remonstrated\r\nas to the size of the benefaction was turned into an owl the penalty\r\ninflicted on the erring janitor of the presidium is another instance\r\n\r\nthe wandering jew legend once started was hard to suppress the\r\nthirteenth fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were the ages\r\nof jewbaiting in the kingdoms of the west and naturally the stories\r\ntook their colour from the prevailing idea\r\n\r\nin  westphalus learned from various sources that the wandering jew\r\nhealed diseases and that he had said he was at rome when it was burned\r\nby nero that he had seen the return of saladin after his eastern\r\nconquests that he had been in constantinople when salimen had built\r\nthe royal mosque that he knew tamerlane the scythian and scander\r\nbeg prince of epirus that he had seen bajazet carried in a cage by\r\ntamerlanes order that he remembered the caliphs of babylon and of\r\negypt the empire of the saracens and the crusades where he had known\r\ngodfrey de bouillon amongst other things he seems to have apologised\r\nfor not seeing the sack of jerusalem because he was at that time in\r\nrome at the court of vespasian\r\n\r\nthe ahasuerus version of the wandering jew legend seems to have been\r\nthe popular one amongst the commonalty in england as an instance\r\nmight be quoted the broadsheet ballad of  it is not without even\r\nhistorical significance as it marks the measure of the time in many\r\nways it is headed the wandering jew or the shoemaker of jerusalem\r\nwho lived when our lord and saviour jesus christ was crucified\r\nappointed by him to live until coming again tune the ladys fall\r\nc licensd and enterd according to order the imprint runs\r\nprinted by and for w o and sold by the booksellers of pyecorner and\r\nlondonbridge\r\n\r\na century and a half laterwas published a much more pretentious\r\nwork on the same theme this was a novel written by rev george croly\r\nit was called salathiel a story of the past the present the\r\nfuture it was published anonymously and had an immediate and lasting\r\nsuccess it was founded on historical lines the author manifestly\r\nbenefiting by the hints afforded by the work of that consummate liar\r\nin a historical sense westphalusor his informant croly was\r\na strange man with a somewhat abnormal faculty of abstraction i\r\nused to hear of him from my father who was a friend of his about a\r\nhundred years ago being of gentle nature he did not wish to cause\r\nany pain or concern to his family or dependents but at the same\r\ntime he as a writer had to guard himself against interruption and\r\nconsequent digression of his thoughts during the times he set apart\r\nfor imaginative work so he devised a scheme which might often be\r\nput in practice with advantage by others similarly employed when\r\nsettling down to a spell of such workwhich as every creative\r\nwriter knows involves periods of mental abstraction though of bodily\r\nrestlessnesshe would stick an adhesive wafer on his forehead the\r\nrule of the house was that when he might be adorned in this wise no one\r\nwas to speak to him or even notice him except under special necessity\r\n\r\nthe great vogue of salathiel lasted some ten or more years when\r\nthe torch of the wandering jew was lighted by eugene sue the french\r\nnovelist who had just completed in the débats his story les mystères\r\nde paris as its successor he chose the theme adopted by croly and\r\nthe new novel le juiferrant ran with overwhelming success in the\r\nconstitutionnel\r\n\r\nsue was what in modern slang is called up to date he knew every\r\ntrick and dodge of the world of advertisement and in conjunction\r\nwith his editor dr veron he used them all but he had good wares\r\nto exploit his novels are really excellent though the changes in\r\nsocial life and in religious political and artistic matters which\r\ntook place between  and  make some things in them seem out of\r\ndate his great imagination and his firm and rapid grasp of salient\r\nfacts susceptible of being advantageously used in narrative pointed\r\nout to him a fresh road it was not sufficient to the hour and place\r\nthat cartaphilusor josephor ahasuerus or salathiel or whatever he\r\nmight be calledshould purge his sin by his personal sufferings alone\r\nin the legend up to then accepted he had long ago repented so to\r\nincrease the poignancy of his sufferings sue took from the experience\r\nof his own time a means of embittering the very inmost soul of such an\r\none he must be made to feel that his existence is a curse not only to\r\nhimself but to all the world to this end he attached to the wanderer\r\nthe obligation of carrying a fell disease the quick brain of the great\r\nfeuilletonist seized the dramatic moment for utilising the occasion\r\na dozen years before the frightful spread of the cholera which had\r\nonce again wrought havoc woke the whole world to new terror some one\r\nof uneasy mind who found diversion in obscure comparisons noted from\r\nthe records of the disease that its moving showed the same progress in\r\na given direction as a mans walking a hint was sufficient for the\r\npublic who eagerly seized the idea that the wandering jew had from the\r\nfirst recorded appearance of the cholera been the fated carrier of\r\nthat dreaded pestilence the idea seemed to be a dramatic inspiration\r\nand had prehensile grasp great as had been the success of the\r\nmysteries of paris that of the wandering jew surpassed it and for\r\nhalf a century the new novel kept vividly before its readers the old\r\ntradition and so brought it down to the present\r\n\r\nwe may now begin to ask ourselves who and where in this great deception\r\nwas the impostor who was the guilty one and at first glance we\r\nare inclined to say there is none whatever the error mistake\r\ndeception or false conclusion there has been no direct guilt this\r\nis to presuppose that guilt is of conscious premeditation and neither\r\nintention of evil nor consciousness of guilt is apparent in legal\r\nphrase the mens rea is lacking\r\n\r\nit is a purely metaphysical speculation whether guilt is a necessary\r\nelement of imposition one is an intellectual experience the other is\r\nan ethical problem and if we are content to deal with responsibility\r\nfor anothers misdoing the question of the degree of blameworthiness\r\nis sufficient let us try a process of exclusions the complete list of\r\nthose who had a part in the misunderstanding regarding the myth of the\r\nwandering jew leaving out the ostensible fictionists were\r\n\r\nthe abbot of st albans the archbishop of armenia the interpreter\r\nthe archbishops servant the monks or laybrothers who singly or in\r\ngeneral conversed with any of the above and finally matthew paris who\r\nrecorded the story in its various phases of these we must except from\r\nall blame both the abbot of st albans and the archbishop of armenia\r\nboth of whom were good grave men of high character and to each of whom\r\nhad been entrusted matters of the highest concern the interpreter\r\nseems to have only fulfilled his office with exactitude if in any way\r\nor part he used his opportunity to impose on the ignorance of the host\r\nor the guest there is no record no suggestion of it matthew paris\r\nwas a man of such keenness of mind of such observation and of such\r\ncritical insight that even today after a lapse of over five hundred\r\nyears and the withstanding of all the tests of a new intellectual\r\nworld which included such inventions as printing and photography he\r\nis looked upon as one of the ablest of chroniclers moreover he put no\r\nnew matter nor comments of his own into the wonderful and startling\r\nnarratives which he was called on to record he even hints at or infers\r\nhis own doubt as to the statements made the monks servants and others\r\nmentioned generally were merely credulous simple people of the time\r\nwith reverence for any story regarding the via dolorosa and respect\r\nor awe for those in high places\r\n\r\nthere remains but the servant of the foreign archbishop it is to\r\nhim that we must look for any outrage on our normal beliefs he was\r\nmanifestly a person of individually small importanceeven matthew\r\nparis whose trained work it was to record with exactness and whose\r\nduty it therefore was to sustain or buttress main facts did not think\r\nit necessary or worth while to mention his name he had in himself\r\nnone of the dignity honour weight learning or position of the\r\nnoble of the church who was the abbots guest he was after all but\r\na personal servant probably one of readiness and expediency with a\r\nquick imagination and a glib tongue one who could wriggle through a\r\ndifficult position defend himself with ready acquiescence gain his\r\nends of securing his masters ease and find all necessary doors open\r\nthrough the bonhommie of his fellow servitors such an one accustomed\r\nto the exigencies of foreign travel must have picked up many quaint\r\nconceits legends and japes and was doubtless a persona grata liked\r\nand looked up to by persons of his own class sanctified to some little\r\nextent by the reflected glory of his masters great position it is\r\nmore than likely that he had been the recipient of many confidences\r\nregarding legend and conjecture concerning sacred matters and that any\r\nsuch legend as he spoke of would have been imparted under conditions\r\nfavourable to his own comfort after the manner of his kind his\r\nstories doubtless lost nothing in the telling and gained considerably\r\nin the retelling even in the short record of matthew paris there\r\nis evidence of this in the way in which after the striking story of\r\ncartaphilus has been told he returns to the matter again adding\r\npicturesque and inconclusive details of the manner of the centennial\r\nrenewal of the wanderers youth the simplest analysis here will show\r\nthe falsity of the story what the great logician archbishop whately\r\nalways insisted oninternal evidenceis dead against the armenian\r\nvalet courier or servitor he gave circumstantial account of the\r\nperiodic illness loss of memory and recovery of youth on the part\r\nof cartaphilus but there is no hint of how he came to know it and\r\ncartaphilus could not have told him nor anybody else we may i think\r\ntake it for granted that no other mere mortal was present for had any\r\nother human being been there all the quacksalvers of a thousand miles\r\naround would have moved heaven and earth to get information of what was\r\ngoing on since in mediæval days there was nearly as much competition\r\nin the world of charlatanism as there is today in the world of sport\r\nthe armenian was much too handy a man at such a crisis to be found out\r\nso we may give him the benefit of the doubt and at once credit him\r\nwith invention it is hard to understandor even to believe without\r\nunderstandingthat so mighty a legend and one so tenacious of life\r\narose and grew from such a beginning and yet it is in accord with\r\nthe irony of nature that one who has unintentionally and unwittingly\r\nachieved a publicity which would dwarf the malign reputation of\r\nherostratus should have his name unrecorded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niv john law\r\n\r\nthe mississippi scheme and its antecedents\r\n\r\n\r\nthe great mississippi scheme which wrought havoc on the french in\r\n is the central and turning point in the history of john law late\r\nof lauriston controllergeneral of finance in france his father\r\nwilliam law grand nephew of james law archbishop of glasgow was a\r\ngoldsmith in that city\r\n\r\nas in the seventeenth century the goldsmiths were also the bankers and\r\nmoneylenders of the community a successful goldsmith might be looked\r\non as on the highroad to great fortune to william law in  was\r\nborn his first son john who had considerable natural talent in the\r\nway of mathematicsand a nature which was such as to nullify their\r\nuse as a youth he showed proficiency in arithmetic and algebra but\r\nas he was also in those early days riotous and dissipated we may\r\nfairly come to the conclusion that he did not use his natural powers\r\nto their best advantage he was already a gambler of a marked kind\r\nbefore he was of age he was already in debt and was squandering his\r\npatrimony he sold the estate of lauriston which his thrifty father\r\nhad acquired and gave himself over to a life of socalled pleasure\r\nhis mother who had family ambitions bought the estate so that it\r\nmight remain in the family of its new possessors he removed himself\r\nto london where within a couple of years he was sentenced to death for\r\nmurdernot a vulgar premeditated murder for gain but the unhappy\r\nresult of a duel wherein he had killed his opponent a boon companion\r\none austin who had acquired the soubriquet of beau austin through\r\nsocial influence the death penalty was commuted for imprisonment\r\nand the crime only regarded as manslaughter he had however to deal\r\nwith the relatives of the dead man who were naturally vindictive one\r\nof them entered an appeal against the commutation of the sentence\r\nlaw with the characteristic prudence of his time and nationality\r\ndid not wait for the leisurely settlement of the legal process but\r\nescaped to the continent where he remained for some years sojourning\r\nin various places being naturally clever and daring he seems to have\r\ngenerally fallen on his feet whilst in holland he became secretary\r\nto an important official in the diplomatic world from which service\r\nhe drifted into an employment with the bank of amsterdam here the\r\nnatural bent of his mind found expression banking in some of its\r\nforms is gambling and as he was both banker and gamblerone by\r\ninherited tendency and the other by personal dispositionhe began to\r\nfind his vogue addressing himself seriously to the intricacies and\r\npossibilities of the profession of banking he was back in scotland in\r\n a risky venture on his part for his felony had not been purged\r\nand published a pamphlet proposals and reasons for constituting a\r\ncouncil of trade in scotland this he followed up after some years\r\nwith another pamphlet money and trade considered with a proposal\r\nfor supplying the nation with money and in the same year  he\r\npropounded to the scotch parliament a scheme for a state bank on the\r\nsecurity of landa venture which on being tried speedily collapsed\r\nthis like other schemes of that period was based on the issue and use\r\nof paper money\r\n\r\nillustration john law\r\n\r\nin the meantime and for five or six years afterwards he was\r\ntravelling variously throughout europe occupying himself with\r\nformulating successive schemes of finance and in gamblinga process\r\nin which he being both skilled and lucky amassed a sum of over a\r\nhundred thousand pounds he had varying fortunes however and was\r\nexpelled from several cities he was not without believers in his\r\npowers amongst them was the earl of stair then ambassador to france\r\nwho allured by his specious methods of finance suggested to the earl\r\nof stanhope that he might be useful in devising a scheme for paying off\r\nthe british national debt after the death of louis xiv in  he\r\nsuggested to the duke of orleans the regent for the young king louis\r\nxv the formation of a state bank the regent favoured the idea but\r\nhis advisers were against it it was however agreed that law might\r\nfound a bank with power to issue notes and accept deposits this was\r\ndone by letters patent and the banque générale came into existence in\r\n and was an immediate success its principle was to issue paper\r\nmoney which was to be repayable by coin its paper rose to a premium\r\nin  in  there was a decree that it was to be accepted in the\r\npayment of taxes this created a new form of cheap money with the\r\nresult that there was a great and sudden extension of industry and\r\ntrade from this rose the idea of a new enterprisethe mississippi\r\ncompanywhich was to outvie the success of the east india company\r\nincorporated by charter in  under the title of the governor and\r\ncompany of the merchants of london trading to the east indies which\r\nafter periods of doubtful fortune and having become consolidated with\r\nits rival the general east india companypartially in  and\r\ncompletely in  under the somewhat elephantine name of the united\r\ncompany of merchants of england trading to the east indieswas now\r\na vast organization of national importance to the new french company\r\nfor exploiting the mississippi valley was made over louisiana which\r\nthen included what were afterwards the states of ohio and missouri\r\nthe decree of incorporation was issued in  the parliament at\r\nparis presently grew jealous of such a concession having been given\r\nto a foreigner and the next year a rumour went about that parliament\r\nwas about to have him arrested tried and hanged the regent met\r\nthe parliamentary resistance by making  the banque générale\r\ninto the banque royalethe king guaranteeing the notes law was\r\nmade director general but he was unable to prevent the regent from\r\nincreasing the issue of paper money by which means he managed to\r\nsatisfy dishonestly his own extravagance it was a fiscal principle\r\nof the time that the state accountants did not go behind the kings\r\nreceiptthe acquit de comptant as it was called\r\n\r\nthe western company was enlarged in  by a grant of a monopoly of\r\ntobacco and of the rights of trading ships and merchandise of the\r\ncompany of senegal in  the banque royale absorbed the rights of\r\nthe east india and china companies and then assumed the allembracing\r\ntitle of compagnie des indes the next year it took in the african\r\ncompany and so through that the whole of the noneuropean trade of\r\nfrance in  the management of the mint was handed over to laws\r\ncompany and he was thus enabled to manipulate the coinage in the\r\nsame year he had undertaken to pay off the french national debt and\r\nso become the sole creditor of the nation he already exercised the\r\nfunctions of receiver general and had revenuefarming abolished in its\r\nfavour he now controlled the collection and disposal of the whole of\r\nthe state taxation at this stage of his adventure law seemed a good\r\nfiscal administrator he repealed or reduced pressing taxes on useful\r\ncommodities and reduced the price of necessaries by forty per cent\r\nso that the peasants could increase the value of their holdings and\r\ntheir crops without fear of coming later into the remorseless grip of\r\nthe taxfarmer under the infamous metayer system freetrade was in\r\nthe provinces practically established this so far as it went was all\r\nlaws doing turgot who later got credit for what had been done only\r\ncarried out what the scotch financier had planned\r\n\r\nlaw had promised high dividends to the speculators in his scheme and\r\nhad so far paid them so it was no wonder that the system raised its\r\nhead again in  all france seemed to flock to paris to such a\r\ndegree and with such unanimity of purpose that it was difficult to\r\nobtain room to go on with the necessary work of the mississippi scheme\r\nin such matters resting on human greed which throws all prudence to\r\nthe winds the pressure is always towards the centre and the narrow\r\nstreet of quin cam poix became a seething mass day and night of\r\nspeculators in a hurry to buy shares the time for trying to sell them\r\nhad not yet arrived\r\n\r\nnaturally such a locality rose in value and as demand emphasises\r\npaucity of space extraordinary prices ruled even a small share in\r\nthe lucky street where fortunes could be made in an hour rose to\r\nfabulous value houses formerly letting for forty pounds a year now\r\nfetched eight hundred pounds per month and no wonder when shares of\r\nthe face value of five hundred livres sold for ten thousand when there\r\nis such an overwhelming desire to buy then is the opportunity for\r\nsellers to realise and the time for such speculation on the one side\r\nand for such commerce on the other is naturally short and the need\r\npressing\r\n\r\nat the beginning of  everything seemed to be increasing in a sort\r\nof geometric ratio after a dividend of forty per cent had been\r\ndeclared shares of five hundred value rose to eighteen thousand\r\ngreed and the opportunity for satisfying its craving turned the\r\nheads of ordinarily sensible people the whole world seemed mad it\r\nappeared right enough that the financial wonderworker who had created\r\nsuch a state of things should be loaded with additional honours it\r\nwas only scriptural that he who had already multiplied his talents\r\nshould be entrusted with more there was universal rejoicing when\r\njohn lawexiled foreigner and condemned murdererwas appointed in\r\njanuary  controllergeneral of the whole finances of france\r\nnaturally enough even the hard head of the canny scot began to\r\nmanifest symptoms of giving way in the shape of becoming exalté and\r\nnaturally enough his enemiesfinancial political and racialdid not\r\nlose the opportunities afforded them of taking advantage of it tongues\r\nbegan to wag and all sorts of rumours some of them reconcilable with\r\ncommon sense and easily credible others outrageous began to go about\r\nlord stair reported that law had boasted that he would raise france on\r\nthe ruins of england and holland to a greater height than she had ever\r\nreached that he could crush the east india company and even destroy\r\nbritish trade and credit when he chose stair resented this and he and\r\nlaw from being close friends became enemies to appease the incensed\r\nand at present allpowerful law the powers that were recalled lord\r\nstair\r\n\r\non  february  the compagnie des indes and the banque royale\r\nwere united thus linking the ends of the financial chain the system\r\nwas now complete\r\n\r\nwhen aladdin set the genius who had hitherto worked so willingly the\r\nfinal task of hanging a rocs egg in the centre of the newlycreated\r\npalace he brought the whole structure tumbling about his ears so it\r\nwas with john law and the egregious mississippi scheme his idea was\r\ncomplete and perfect but the high sun when it reaches its meridianal\r\nsplendour begins from that instant its downward course\r\n\r\nthe reaction was not long in manifesting itself usually in such\r\nmatters there is a pause before the great drivingwheels reverse\r\ntheir motion and the backward motion beginning slowly gathers way\r\nas it progresses but in this case human intelligence and not soulless\r\nmachinery was the propulsive force of reaction the speculators had\r\nbegun to work before the onward movement had come to an end or even\r\nbegun to slacken they were loaded up with a vast amount of stocks\r\nwhose value even if there had been money to redeem them was severely\r\nlimited whereas they had purchased at prices varying between the\r\nfirst rise above nominal value and that reached by the last desperate\r\nspeculator it is not wise to hold such inflated stock too long and in\r\na crisis sailingmaster wisdom orders quartermaster caution to take\r\na trick at the helm when the bare idea of unification of financial\r\ninterests was mooted the wise holders of stock commenced to unload\r\nwhen this movement began its progress was rapidso long as there was\r\nanything to be moved the first class to feel it were the bankers the\r\nspecie ran out like the pentup water from a burst reservoir till in\r\nan incredibly short time there was not sufficient remaining to afford\r\nthe moneychange needed in daily life the advisers and officials of\r\nthe state seriously alarmed began at once to take strong measures\r\nsupported by royal decrees then as ruin began to stare the whole\r\nnation in the face more and more with every hour desperate expedients\r\nwere resorted to the value of the currency was made by every\r\nstratagem dishonest trick and unscrupulous exercise of power to\r\nfluctuate so that such differences or margins as arose might be grasped\r\nforthwith for national use payments in bullion except for very small\r\namounts were forbidden the possession of anything over five hundred\r\nlivres in specie was deemed an offence punishable by confiscation\r\npartial or wholesale and by fine domiciliary visits were paid to seek\r\nevidence of offence and to enforce the new laws and informers in this\r\nconnection were well paid\r\n\r\nthen began a war between public oppression and individual trickery\r\nto defend acquired rights and evade unjust demands the holders of\r\npaper money unable to realise in specie tried to protect themselves\r\nby purchasing goods of intrinsic value precious metals jewels and\r\nsuch like were bought in such quantities that the supplies diminished\r\nand the prices grew until to avoid immediate ruin such purchases\r\nwere proclaimed illegal and prohibited then ordinary commodities of\r\nlesser values were tried as means of barter till their prices too\r\nrose to such an extent that trade was paralysed in order to meet the\r\ngrowing danger a still more desperate expedient was resorted to a\r\ndecree was issued the effect of which would be to reducegradually\r\nit was hopedthe obligation of bank notes to onehalf their nominal\r\nvalue this completed the panic for here was a position which could\r\nnot be guarded against by any prudence or wisdom no one could\r\nhenceforth by any possibility be financially safe the speculators who\r\nhad already realised were alone safe bona fide investors if not\r\nalready overwhelmed by disaster saw the tide of ruin rising rapidly\r\naround them nothing within the power of the state could now be done\r\nto check or even lessen the state of panic not even the reversal of\r\nthe late decree in ten days after its issue to make matters still\r\nworse the banque at this very time suspended payment probably in\r\na wild endeavour to do something which would avert odium from\r\nitself by saddling the responsibility on someone else the government\r\nprocured the dismissal of law from the controllergeneralship of\r\nfinance howeverstrange to sayhe was very soon appointed by the\r\nregent as intendantgeneral of commerce and director of the ruined\r\nbank the muchvaunted idolised and believedin system had now\r\nfallen hopelessly and was ruined forever law was everywhere attacked\r\nand insulted with such unmitigated rancour that he had to leave

adherent of the pretender he pleaded in\r\nthe kings bench the royal pardon for the murder of beau austin which\r\nhad been sent to him in  he spent the succeeding few years in\r\nengland whence he corresponded with the duke of orleans he expected\r\nto be recalled to france but his hope was never realised he wished to\r\ngo to the continent but was practically a prisoner in england fearing\r\nto leave it lest he should be arrested by his creditors amongst whom\r\nwas the new french east india company which had been reconstructed on\r\nthe ruins of the old in  sir robert walpole then prime minister\r\nasked lord townshend the secretary of state to give law a kings\r\ncommission of some sort so that such might serve for his protection\r\nin the same year he went to italy he died in venice in  in what\r\ncompared with his former state was poverty to the last he was a\r\ngambler always ready to take long risks for a prospect however\r\nremote of large gain a story is told that in his last years he\r\nwagered his last thousand pounds to a shilling  to  against\r\nthe throwing of double sixes six consecutive times the law of chances\r\nwas with him and naturally he won he renewed his wager but the\r\nauthorities would not allow the further gamble to take place\r\n\r\njohn law married quite early in life the daughter of the earl of\r\nbanbury and widow of mr seignior his widow died in  some of\r\nthe members of his family were not undistinguished his son died a\r\ncolonel in the austrian service and one of his nephews became comte de\r\nlauriston and rose to be a general in the french army and aidedecamp\r\nto the first napoleon he was made a marshal of france by louis xviii\r\n\r\njohn law was a handsome and distinguishedlooking man blonde with\r\nsmall dark grey eyes and fresh complexion he made an agreeable\r\nimpression on strangers saintsimon the social historian gave him a\r\ngood character innocent of greed and knavery a mild good man whom\r\nfortune had not spoilt others of his time regarded him as a pioneer\r\nof modern statesmanship\r\n\r\nhow is it then that such a man must be set down an impostor in\r\nhistorical perspective as an impostor he must be regarded though not\r\nas such in the narrowest view the answer is that his very prominence\r\nsits amongst his judges lesser men and greater men of lesser\r\nposition might well stand excused in matters wherein he is accorded\r\ncondemnation\r\n\r\n    that in the captains but a choleric word\r\n    which in the soldier is flat blasphemy\r\n\r\nif when a man plays a game wherein life and death and the fortunes\r\nof many thousands are involved it behoves him to be at least\r\ncareful much greater is his responsibility where the prosperity\r\nand happiness of nations are at stake had law merely started new\r\ntheories of finance and had they gone wrong he might well claim\r\nand be accorded excuse but his were inventions of what in modern\r\nslang is called getrichquick principles not only did law not\r\nenrich human lifewith one exception that of enlarging the currency\r\nin useor add to the sum total of human wellbeing and happiness he\r\neven neglected to show that forethought and consideration for others\r\nwhich in all honour ought to be exercised by the deviser and controller\r\nof great risks he was a gambler and a gambler only he merely put\r\ninto the pockets of some persons that which he had taken out of the\r\npockets of others and in doing so showed no consideration for the\r\npoor the thrifty the needyfor any of those whose contentment and\r\nhappiness depend on such as are in high places and dowered in some\r\nway with productive powers the soulless uneducated churl who does an\r\nhonest days work does more for humanity than the genius who merely\r\nshifts about the already garnered wealth of ages john law posed as\r\na benefactor and accepted all the benefits that accrued to him from\r\nthe praises of those who followed in his wake and gleaned the rich\r\nwastage of his empiremoving theories and schemes financiers of laws\r\ntype no more benefit a country or enrich a people than do the hordes\r\nof wasters and tapebetting men who prey on labour as locusts do on\r\nthe crops if they wish not to do unnecessary harmwhich is putting\r\ntheir duty at the lowest possible estimatethey should at least try to\r\navoid repeating the errors which have wrecked others a brief glance at\r\nthe wreckage which lay well within the scotch gamblers vision will\r\nshow how he shut his eyes deliberately not only to facts but to the\r\nmany correlations of cause and effect before his mississippi scheme\r\nwas formulated there had been experience of banking enterprises of\r\nschemes for mercantile combination and for the exploitation of capital\r\nof adventurous dealings in the developments of countries new and more\r\nor less savage east and west and south\r\n\r\nthe following list will typify of all these john law had knowledge\r\nsufficient to judge of difficulties to be encountered in the early\r\nstages of dangers not only incidental to the things themselves but\r\nbased deep in human nature\r\n\r\n  the east india company founded in \r\n  the bank of england founded in \r\n  the africa company founded in \r\n  the darien company founded in \r\n\r\na glance at each of these all of which were within the scope and\r\nknowledge of law their aims formation and development up to the time\r\nspoken of can hardly fail to be illuminative the sixteenth century\r\nhad been an age of adventure and discovery the seventeenth of the\r\nfoundation of great commercial enterprise of conception of ideas of\r\nthe constructive beginnings of things the time for development had\r\ncome with the eighteenth and now care and forethought prudence and\r\nresource were the preparations for success\r\n\r\nthe east india company was in reality the pioneer of corporate\r\ntrading and as for nearly a hundred years it was in a measure alone\r\nin its scale of magnitude its experiences could well serve as\r\nexemplar guide and danger signal it was based on that surest of all\r\nundertakings natural growth it came into existence because it was\r\nwanted and from no other cause its very name its modest capital its\r\nselfprotective purpose make for understanding\r\n\r\nin its charter of incorporation its purpose was indicated in the name\r\nthe governor and company of merchants of london trading to the east\r\nindies its capital was £ which though a large sum for those\r\ndays was according to our modern lights an almost ridiculously small\r\nsum for the object then before it and to which it ultimately attained\r\nthe time was ripe for just such an undertaking\r\n\r\nthe peace of vervins  which left both france and spain free\r\nto look after their domestic concerns was immediately followed by\r\nthe edict of nantes  which gave religious liberty to france\r\nand such a new freedom is always followed by national expansion\r\nby this time spainthe explorer or conquerorand hollandthe\r\npatient organiserheld eastern commerce in their hands england\r\nhad been gradually making a commerce of her own in the indies and\r\nall that was required was an official acknowledgment so that the\r\nthunder of her guns should when required follow the creaking of her\r\ncordage from the story of this great enterprise through its first\r\ntwentyfive years could be drawn the lesson of such schemes as law\r\nwas now formulating though it had succeeded in spite of dutch and\r\nportuguese opposition in establishing factories when the historic\r\nmassacre by the dutch at amboyna in the molucca islands took place\r\nin  the eastern company seemed near its dissolution it was not\r\ntill the establishment of the hooghly factory in  that things\r\nbegan to look up after that fortune favoured the company more\r\nthan she had appeared likely to do at the start the marriage of\r\ncharles ii to catherine of braganza in  brought progress in its\r\ntrain catherines dower which included bombay and so put a part of\r\nportugals later possessions in british keeping greatly stimulated the\r\neast india company which thenceforth was able to weather the storms\r\nthat threatened or assailed the privilege of making war on its own\r\naccount conceded by charles ii gave the company a national importance\r\nwhich was destined to consolidate its interests with those of england\r\nitself so strong did it become that before the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury it was able to resist the attack on its charter made by a\r\npowerful and progressive rival the new company the rivals after a\r\nfew years of pourparlers and tentative efforts were united in \r\nand thenceforth the amalgamation under the title the united company\r\nof merchants of england trading to the east indies was practically\r\nunassailable on its own account it was additionally safe in that it\r\nhad the protection of the great whig party under godolphin the capital\r\nof the company now enlarged to £ was lent to the government\r\nat five per cent interest and was finally merged in the national\r\nfunds the history of the company after  does not belong here as\r\nit is only considered as showing that john law had the experience of an\r\nearlier company similar to his own to guide him in its management if he\r\nhad chosen to avail himself of it\r\n\r\nthe bank of england was strangely enough the project of a scotchman\r\nwilliam paterson the plan was submitted to government in  but\r\nwas not carried into existence for three years it was purely a\r\nbusiness concern brought into effective existence through the needs\r\nof commerce the opportunity afforded being the need of the state\r\nand the concern of the statesman it had a capital at first of over\r\n£ which was loaned to the nation on the security of the taxes\r\nwhen the charter was signed there being certain safeguards against\r\nthe possibility of political misuse the controlling board was to have\r\ntwentyfive members who were to be elected annually by the stockholders\r\nwith a substantial qualification there were at this time in england\r\nprivate banks but this was an effort to formulate the banking\r\nrights duties and powers of capital under the ægis of the state\r\nitself but even so sound a venture enormously popular from the very\r\nfirst and with the whole might of the nation behind it had its own\r\ndifficulties to encounter its instantaneous success was an incentive\r\nto other adventurers and the cooperation with government which it\r\nmade manifest created jealousy with private persons and commercial\r\nconcerns within two years its very existence was threatened first by\r\nthe individual hostility of those in the bullion trade who already\r\nacted as bankers and then by a rival concern incorporated under strong\r\npolitical support this was the national land bank whose purpose was\r\nto use the security of real estate as a guarantee for the paper money\r\nwhich it issued for convenient usage strong as the bank of england\r\nwas by its nature its popularity and its support it was in actual\r\ndanger until the rival which had never caught onto use an apposite\r\namericanismactually and almost instantaneously collapsed\r\n\r\nthe safety thus temporarily obtained was purchased at the cost to the\r\ngovernment of a further loan of two million sterlingwith the value to\r\nthe contra of an alliance thus begun with the whig ministry\r\n\r\na further danger came from the mad and maddening south sea scheme five\r\nyears later but from which it was happily saved solely through the\r\ngreater cupidity and daring of the newer company\r\n\r\nthe darien company which followed hard on the heels of the african\r\ncompany was formed in  by paterson on the base of an act of the\r\nscottish parliament for the purpose of making an opening for scottish\r\ncapital after the manner of the east india company by which english\r\nenterprise had already so largely benefited its career was of such\r\nshort duration and its failure so complete that there was little\r\ndifficulty in understanding the causes of its collapse it might\r\nserve for a pendant of lambs criticism of the meat that was ill\r\nfed and ill killed ill kept and ill cooked the company was started\r\nto utilise in addition to exploiting new lands the waste of time\r\nenergy and capital between west and east and yet it was not till the\r\nfirst trading fleet was sailing that its objective was made known to\r\nthe adventurers its ideas of trading were those of a burlesque and\r\nits materials of barter with tropical savages on the criminal side of\r\nthe ludicrousbibles heavy woollen stuffs and periwigs naturally\r\na couple of years finished its working existence and the rest is\r\nsilence and yet at the inception of the scheme two great nations vied\r\nwith one another for its control\r\n\r\nthere are those who may say that john law was not an impostor but\r\na great financier who made a mistake financiers must not make\r\nmistakesor else they must be classed amongst the impostors for they\r\ndeal with the goods and prospects of others as well as their own\r\nlaw was simply a gambler on a great scale he led a nation through\r\nits units to believe that the following of his ideas would lead to\r\nsuccess financial schemes without good ideas and practical working to\r\ncarry them out are deceptive and destructive the mississippi scheme\r\nis a case in point if the original intention had been carried out\r\nin its entiretywhich involved vast pioneering and executive action\r\nof present and future generations and an almost absolute foregoing\r\nof immediate benefitsthe result would have been of immense service\r\nto the successors in title of the original ventures the assessable\r\nvalue of the real estate conveyed under the mississippi scheme today\r\nequals more than a third of the present gigantic national debt of\r\nfrance swollen though the latter is by the napoleonic wars the war\r\nwith austria the cost and indemnity of the war with germany and in\r\naddition by the long wars with england and russia\r\n\r\nif human beings had been angels content with the prospect of gains in\r\nthe distant future laws schemes might have succeeded as it was he\r\nworking for his own purposes with an imperfect humanity can only be\r\njudged by results\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nv witchcraft and clairvoyance\r\n\r\na the period\r\n\r\n\r\nfor convenience the masculine offender is in demonology classed under\r\nthe female designation according to michelet and other authorities\r\nthere were ten thousand alleged witches for each alleged wizard and\r\nanyhow there is little etiquette as to the precedence of ladies in\r\ncriminal matters\r\n\r\nthe first english statute dealing directly with witches appears to be\r\nthe thirtythird of henry viii  which brought into the list of\r\nfelonies persons devising or practising conjurations witchcraftes\r\nsorcerie or inchantments or the digging up of corpses and depriving\r\nsuch of the benefit of clergy it was however repealed by i edward vi\r\ncap  and again by i mary in its first section queen elizabeth\r\nhowever passed another act  elizabeth cap  practically repeating\r\nthat of her father which had been in abeyance for more than thirty\r\nyears the statute of elizabeth is exceedingly interesting in that it\r\nstates the condition of the law at that time the opening words leave\r\nno misunderstanding\r\n\r\n    whereas at this day there is no ordinary nor condigne punishment\r\n    provided against the wicked offences of conjurations or\r\n    invocations of evil spirits or of sorceries inchantments\r\n    charmes or witchcraftes which be practised to the obstruction\r\n    of the persons and goods of the queenes subjects or for other\r\n    lewd purposes be it enacted that if any person or persons\r\n    after the first day of june next coming shall use practice or\r\n    exercise any invocations or conjurations of evill or wicked\r\n    spirits to or for any intent or purpose or else if any person\r\n    or persons after the said first day of june shall use practice\r\n    or exercise any witchcraft enchantment charme or sorcerie\r\n    whereby any person shall happen to be killed or destroied that\r\n    then as well every such offendour or offendours in invocations\r\n    or conjurations as is aforesayde their aydours and counsellors\r\n    as also everie such offendour or offendours in that witchcrafte\r\n    enchantment charme or sorcerie whereby the death of any person\r\n    doth ensue their ayders and counsellors being of eyther of\r\n    the sayde offences lawfully convicted and attainted shall\r\n    suffer paines of death as a felon or felons and shall lose the\r\n    privilege and benefit of clergy and sanctuary c\r\n\r\nin this act lesser penalties are imposed for using any form of\r\nwitchcraft or sorcery for inducing to any persons harm or to provoke\r\nany person to unlawfull love or to hurt or destroy any person in his\r\nor her bodye member or goods or for the discovery or recovery of\r\ntreasure from that time down to the first quarter of the eighteenth\r\ncentury when the law practically died out witchcraft had its place in\r\nthe category of legal offences the law was finally repealed by an act\r\nin the tenth year of george ii the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nwere the time of witchfever and in that period especially in its\r\nearlier days when the belief had become epidemic it was ruthless and\r\ndestructive it is said that in genoa five hundred persons were burned\r\nwithin three months in the year  and a thousand in the diocese of\r\ncomo in a year round numbers in such matters are to be distrusted\r\nas we find they seldom bear investigation but there is little doubt\r\nthat in france and germany vast numbers suffered and perished even in\r\nmore prosaic and less emotional england there were many thousands of\r\njudicial murders in this wise it is asserted that within two centuries\r\nthey totalled thirty thousand\r\n\r\nit is startling to find such a weird and impossible credulity actually\r\nrooted in the statute book of ones own country and that there are\r\nrecords of judges charging juries to convict sir matthew hale a great\r\nlawyer a judge of the common pleas in  and lord chief justice in\r\n was a firm believer in witchcraft he was a grave and pious man\r\nand all his life was an ardent student of theology as well as of law\r\nand yet in  he sentenced women to be burned as witches in  a\r\nmother and daughterthe latter only nine years of agewere hanged in\r\nhuntingdon in scotland the last case of a woman being condemned as a\r\nwitch occurred at dornoch in \r\n\r\nit is no easy task in these days which are rationalistic iconoclastic\r\nand enquiring to understand how the commonalty not only believed\r\nin witchcraft but acted on that belief probably the most tolerant\r\nview we can take is that both reason and enquiry are essential\r\nand rudimentary principles of human nature every person of normal\r\nfaculties likes to know and understand the reasons of things\r\nand inquisitiveness is not posterior to the period of maternal\r\nalimentation if we seek for a cause we are bound to find oneeven\r\nif it be wrong omne ignotum pro magnifico has a wide if not always\r\na generous meaning and when fear is founded on if not inspired by\r\nignorance that unthinking ferocity which is one of our birthrights\r\nfrom adam is apt to carry us further than we ever meant to go in an\r\nage more clearseeing than our own and less selfish we shall not think\r\nso poorly of primitive emotions as we are at present apt to on the\r\ncontrary we shall begin to understand that in times when primitivity\r\nholds sway we are most in touch with the loftiest things we are\r\ncapable of understanding and our judgment being complex is most\r\nexact indeed in this branch of the subject persons used to call to aid\r\na special exercise of our natural forcesthe æsthetic when witchcraft\r\nwas a belief the common idea was that that noxious power was almost\r\nentirely held by the old and ugly the young fresh and beautiful\r\nwere seldom accepted as witches save by the noveltyloving few or\r\nthose of sensual nature this was perhaps fortunateif the keeping\r\ndown of the population in this wise was necessary it is easier as\r\nwell as safer to murder the uncomely than those of greater charm in\r\nany case there was no compunction about obliterating the former class\r\nthe general feeling was much the same as that in our own time which in\r\nsporting circles calls for the destruction of vermin\r\n\r\nit will thus be seen that the profession of witchcraft if occasionally\r\nlucrative was nevertheless always accompanied with danger and\r\nexecration this was natural enough since the belief which made\r\nwitchcraft dangerous was based on fear it is not too much to say that\r\nin every case professed witchcraft was an expression of fraudulent\r\nintent such pity therefore as the subject allows of must be confined\r\nto the guiltless victims who despite blameless life were tried by\r\npassion judged by frenzy and executed by remorseless desperation\r\nthere could be no such thing as quantitative analysis of guilt with\r\nregard to the practice of witchcraft any kind of playing with the\r\nsubject was a proof of some kind of wrongful intent and was to be\r\njudged with draconian severity doubtless it was a very simple way\r\nof dealing with evils much resembling the medical philosophy of the\r\nchinese the whole logic of it can be reduced to a sorites any change\r\nfrom the normal is the work of the devilor a devil as the case\r\nmay be find out the normal residence of that especial devilwhich\r\nis in some human being destroy the devils dwelling you get rid of\r\nthe devil it is pure savagery of the most primitive kind and it\r\nis capable of expansion for logic is a fertile plant and when its\r\npremises are wrong it has the fecundity of a weed before even a savage\r\ncan have time to breathe his logic is piling so fast on him that he\r\nis smothered if a human being is a devil then the club which destroys\r\nhim or her is an incarnation of good and so a god to be worshipped in\r\nsome formor at any rate to be regarded with esteem like a sword\r\nor a legal wig or a stethoscope or a paintbrush or a shovel\r\nor a compass or a drinkingvessel or a pen if all the necessary\r\nconditions of life and sanity and comfort were on so primitive a base\r\nwhat an easy world it would be to live in\r\n\r\none benefit there was in witchcraft though it was not recognised\r\nofficially as such at the time it created a new industrya whole\r\ncrop of industries it is of the nature of belief that it encourages\r\nbeliefnot always of exactly the same kindbut of some form which\r\nintelligence can turn into profit we cannot find any good in the new\r\nindustrygrapes do not grow on thorns nor figs on thistles the sum\r\nof human happiness was in no sense augmented but at least a good deal\r\nof money or moneys worth changed hands which after all is as much\r\nas most of the great financiers can point to as the result of long and\r\nstrenuous success in the organisation of this form of crime there were\r\nmany classes of varying risks and of benefits in inverse ratio to\r\nthem for the ordinary rule of finance holds even here large interest\r\nmeans bad security first there were the adventurers themselves who\r\ntook the great risks of life and its collateralsesteem happiness\r\nc the money obtained by this class was usually secured by fraudulent\r\nsales of worthless goods or by the simple old financial device of\r\nblackmail then there were those who were in reality merely parasites\r\non the pleasing callingthose timorous souls who let i dare not\r\nwait upon i would like the poor cat i the adage these were\r\naltogether in a poorer way of trade than their bolder brothers and\r\nsisters they lacked courage and sometimes even sufficient malice\r\nfor the proper doing of their work with the result that success\r\nseldom attended them at all and never heartily but at any rate they\r\ncould not complain of inadequate punishment whenever religious zeal\r\nflamed up they were generally prominent victims they can in reality\r\nonly be regarded as specimens of parasitic growth then there came\r\nthe class known in french criminal circles as agents provocateurs\r\nwhose business was not only to further ostensible crime but to work\r\nup the opposition against it either branch of their art would\r\nprobably be inadequate but by linking their services they managed to\r\neke out a livelihood lastly there was the lowest grade of all the\r\nwitchfindera loathly calling comparable only to the class or guild\r\nof paraskistae or rippers in the ritual of the mummy industry of\r\nancient egypt\r\n\r\nof these classes we may i think consider some choice specimensso\r\nfar as we may fittingly investigate the personnel of a bygone\r\nindustry of the main body that of wizards and witches or those\r\npretending to the cult let us take doctor dee and madame voisin and\r\nsir edward kelley and mother damnablethus representing the method of\r\nthe procession of the unclean animals from the ark of the class of\r\nwitchfinders one example will probably be as much as we can stand and\r\nwe will naturally take the one who obtained fame in his callingnamely\r\nmatthew hopkins who stands forth like satan by merit raised to that\r\nbad eminence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nb doctor dee\r\n\r\n\r\neven a brief survey of the life of the celebrated doctor dee the\r\nsocalled wizard of the sixteenth century will leave any honest\r\nreader under the impression that in the perspective of history he was\r\na much maligned man if it had not been that now and again he was led\r\ninto crooked byepaths of alleged occultism his record might have\r\nstood out as that of one of the most accomplished and sincere of the\r\nscientists of his time he was in truth whatever were his faults\r\nmore sinned against than sinning if the english language is not so\r\nelastic as some others in the matter of meaning of phrases the same\r\nor a greater effect can be obtained by a careful use of the various\r\ndialects of the british empire in the present case we may if english\r\nlacks well call on some of the varieties of scotch terminology\r\nthe intellectual status of the prime wizard as he is held to be in\r\ngeneral opinion can be well indicated by any of the following words\r\nor phrases wanting crank a tile off a wee bit saft a bee\r\nin his bonnet each of these is indicative of some form of monomania\r\ngenerally harmless if john dee had not had some great qualities such\r\nnegative weaknesses would have prevented his reputation ever achieving\r\na permanent place in history of any kind as it is his place was won by\r\nmany accomplished facts the following is a broad outline of his life\r\nwhich was a long one lasting for over eighty years\r\n\r\njohn dee was born in  and came of a welsh race a good many years\r\nafter his start in life he after the harmless fashion of those and\r\nother times made out a family tree in which it was shewn that he was\r\ndescended from among other royalties roderick the great prince of\r\nwales this little effort of vanity did not however change anything\r\nthe world cared then about such things almost as little as it does\r\nnow or allowing for the weakness of human beings in the way of their\r\nown selfimportance it might be better to say as it professes to do\r\nnow john dee was sent to the university of cambridge when he was only\r\nfifteen years old the college chosen for him was st johns and here\r\nhe showed extraordinary application in his chosen subject mathematics\r\nhe took his probationary degree of bachelor of arts in  and was\r\nmade a fellow in  in his early years of college life his work was\r\nregulated in a remarkable way out of the twentyfour hours eighteen\r\nwere devoted to study four to sleep the remaining two being set\r\napart for meals and recreation lest this should seem incredible it\r\nmay be remembered that three hundred years later the french jesuits\r\nhaving made exhaustive experiments arrived at the conclusion that for\r\nmere purposes of health without making any allowance for the joy or\r\nhappiness of life and treating the body merely as a machine from which\r\nthe utmost amount of work mental and physical could be got without\r\ninjury four hours of sleep per diem sufficed for health and sanity\r\nand it is only natural that a healthy and ambitious young man trying to\r\nwork his way to success would or might have been equally strenuous\r\nand selfdenying his appointment as fellow of st johns was one of\r\nthose made when the college was founded that he was skilled in other\r\nbranches of learning was shown by the fact that in the university he\r\nwas appointed as under reader in greek he was daring in the practical\r\napplication of science and during the representation of one of the\r\ncomedies of aristophanes created such a sensation by appearing to fly\r\nthat he began to be credited by his companions with magical powers\r\nthis was probably the beginning of the sinister reputation which seemed\r\nto follow him all his life afterwards when once an idea of the kind\r\nhas been started even the simplest facts of life and work seem to\r\ngather round it and enlarge it indefinitely so far as we can judge\r\nafter a lapse of over three hundred years john dee was an eager and\r\nardent seeker after knowledge and all through his life he travelled\r\nin the search wherever he was likely to gain his object it is a main\r\ndifficulty of following such a record that we have only facts to\r\nfollow we know little or nothing of motives except from results and\r\nas in the development of knowledge the measure of success can only\r\nbear a small ratio to that of endeavour it is manifest that we should\r\nshow a large and tolerant understanding of the motives which animate\r\nthe seeker for truth in the course of his long life john dee visited\r\nmany lands sojourned in many centres of learning had relations of\r\ncommon interests as well as of friendship with many great scholars\r\nand made as thinker mathematician and astronomer a reputation far\r\ntranscending any ephemeral and purely gaseous publicity arising from\r\nthe openmouthed wonder of the silly folk who are not capable of even\r\ntrying to understand things beyond their immediate ken wherever he\r\nwent he seems to have been in touch with the learned and progressive\r\nmen of his time and always a student at various times he was in\r\nthe low countries louvain from whose university he obtained the\r\ndegree of lld paris wurtemberg antwerp presburg lorraine\r\nfrankfortontheoder bohemia cracow prague and hessecassel he\r\neven went so far afield as st helena he was engaged on some great\r\nworks of more than national importance for instance when in \r\npope gregory xiii instituted the reform of the calendar which was\r\nadopted by most of the great nations of the world dee approved and\r\nworked out his own calculations to an almost similar conclusion\r\nthough the then opposition to him cost england a delay of over one\r\nhundred and seventy years in  he had proved his excellence as an\r\nastronomer in his valuable work in relation to a newly discovered star\r\ntycho brahes in cassiopœia in  he made a

been made in the monasteries\r\nbroken up by henry viii of which the major part were then to be\r\nobtained both easily and cheaply he was a doctor of laws which\r\nby the way was his only claim to be called doctor dee the title\r\ngenerally accorded to him he was made a rector in worcestershire in\r\n and in  archbishop parker gave him ten years use of the\r\nlivings of upton and long leadenham he was made warden of manchester\r\ncollege in  and was named by queen elizabeth as chancellor of st\r\npauls in  he was appointed dean of gloucester though through\r\nhis own neglect of his own interest it was never carried out the\r\nqueen approved the archbishop sealed the deed but dee unmindful\r\noverlooked the formality of acceptance and the gift eventually went\r\nelsewhere queen elizabeth who consistently believed in and admired\r\nhim wanted to make him a bishop but he declined the responsibility\r\nfor once the formality at consecration nolo episcopari was spoken\r\nwith truthful lips more than once he was despatched to foreign places\r\nto make special report in the queens service that he did notalways\r\nat all eventsput private interest before public duty is shown by his\r\nrefusal to accept two rectories offered to him by the queen in \r\nurging as an excuse that he was unable to find time for the necessary\r\nduties since he was too busily occupied in making calculations for\r\nthe reformation of the calendar he seems to have lived a most proper\r\nlife and was twice married after a long struggle with adversity in\r\nwhichlast despair of a scholarhe had

time of the armada following on\r\nsome correspondence with queen elizabeth he had returned to england\r\nafter long and adventurous experiences in poland and elsewhere during\r\nwhich he had known what it was to receive the honours and affronts of\r\ncommunities he took back with him the reputation of being a sorcerer\r\none which he had never courted and which so rankled in him that many\r\nyears afterwards he petitioned james i to have him tried so that he\r\nmight clear his character\r\n\r\nif there be any truth whatever in the theory that men have attendant\r\nspirits bad as well as good dr dees bad spirit took the shape of\r\none who pretended to occult knowledge the socalled sir edward kelley\r\nof whom we shall have something to say later on\r\n\r\ndee was fiftyfour years of age when he met sir edward kelley who was\r\ntwentyeight years his junior the two men became friends and then\r\nthe old visionary scholar at once became dominated by his younger and\r\nless scrupulous companion who very soon became his partner from that\r\ntime dees downfallor rather downslide began all the longings\r\nafter occult belief which he had hitherto tried to hold in check began\r\nnot only to manifest themselves but to find expression his science\r\nbecame merged in alchemy his astronomical learning was forced into\r\nthe service of astrology his belief which he as a cleric held before\r\nhim as a duty was lost in spiritualism and other forms of occultism\r\nhe began to make use for practical purposes of his crystal globe and\r\nhis magic mirror in which he probably had for long believed secretly\r\nkelley practically ruined his reputation by using for his own purposes\r\nthe influence which he had over the old man his opportunities were\r\nincreased by the arrival in england of laski about  the two\r\nscholars had many ideas in common and kelley did not fail in the\r\nfurtherance of his own views to take advantage of the circumstance\r\nhe persuaded dee to go with his new friend to poland in the hope of\r\nbenefiting further in his studies in the occult by wider experience\r\nof foreign centres of learning they journeyed to laskoe near cracow\r\nwhere the weakness of the english scholar became more evident and his\r\nform of madness more developed dee had now a fixed belief in two\r\nideas which he had hitherto failed to materialisethe philosophers\r\nstone and the elixir of life both of them dreams held as possible of\r\nrealisation to the scientific dreamer in the period of the renaissance\r\ndee believed at one time that he had got hold of the philosophers\r\nstone and actually sent to queen elizabeth a piece of gold taken from\r\na transmuted warmingpan as it is said in the life of dee that he\r\nand kelley had found a quantity of the elixir of life in the ruins of\r\nglastonbury abbey we can easily imagine what part the latter had in\r\nthe transaction it was he too who probably fixed on glastonbury as\r\nthe place in which to search for elixirs as that holy spot had already\r\na reputation of its own in such matters it has been held for ages that\r\nthe staff used by joseph of arimathea took root and blossomed there\r\nsomehow whatever the glastonbury elixir did the philosophers stone\r\ndid not seem to keep its alleged properties in the dee family john\r\ndees young son arthur aged eight tried its efficacy but without\r\nsuccess perhaps it was this failure which made kelley more exacting\r\nfor a couple of years later in  he told his partner that angels\r\nhad told him it was the divine wish that they should have their wives\r\nin common the sage who was fond of his wifewho was a comely woman\r\nwhereas kelleys was ill favoured and devoid of charmsnaturally\r\ndemurred at such an utterance even of occult spirits mrs dee also\r\nobjected with the result that there were alarums and excursions and\r\nthe partnership was rudely dissolvedwhich is a proof that though the\r\naged philosophers mind had been vitiated by the evil promptings of his\r\nwily companion he had not quite declined to idiocy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc la voisin\r\n\r\n\r\nin paris a woman named des hayes voisin a widow who had taken up the\r\nbusiness of a midwife towards the end of the seventeenth century\r\nmade herself notorious by the telling of fortunes such at least\r\nwas the manifest occupation of the worthy lady and as she did not\r\nflaunt herself unduly her existence was rather a retired one few who\r\ndid not seek her services knew of her existence fewer still of her\r\nresidence the life of a professor of such mysteries as the doings of\r\nfatesocalledis prolonged and sweetened by seclusion but there\r\nis always an underground way of obtaining information for such as\r\nreally desire it and madame voisin for all her evasive retirement\r\nwas always to be found when wantedwhich means when she herself wanted\r\nto be found she was certainly a marvellous prophet within a certain\r\nrange of that occult art like all clever people she fixed limitations\r\nfor herself which was wise of her for to prophesy on behalf of every\r\none who may yearn for a raising of the curtain be it of never so small\r\na corner on all possible subjects is to usurp the general functions\r\nof the almighty wisely therefore madame voisin became a specialist\r\nher subject was husbands her chief theme their longevity naturally\r\nsuch women as were unsatisfied with the personality circumstances\r\nor fortunes of their partners joined the mass of her clientèle a\r\nmass which taking it bye and large maintained a strange exactness\r\nof dimensions this did not much trouble the public or even the body\r\nof her clients for no one except madame herself knew their numbers\r\nit was certainly a strange thing how accurately madame guessed for\r\nshe had seemingly no data to go onthe longevity of the husbands were\r\nnever taken into the confidence of the prophet she took care to keep\r\nalmost to herself the rare good fortune in a sense which attended her\r\ndivination for ever since the misfortune which had attended the late\r\nmarquise de brinvilliers became public the powers of the law had taken\r\na quite unnecessary interest in the proceedings of all of her cult\r\nlongevity is quite a onesided arrangement of nature we can only be\r\nsure of its accuracy when it is too late to help in its accomplishment\r\nin such a game there is only one throw of the dice so that it behoves\r\nanyone who would wager successfully to be very sure that the chances\r\nare in hisor herfavour\r\n\r\nmadame voisins clients were generally in a hurry and so were willing\r\nto take any little trouble or responsibility necessary to ensure\r\nsuccess they had two qualities which endear customers to those of la\r\nvoisins trade they were grateful and they were silent that they\r\nwere of cheery and hopeful spirit was shown by the fact that as a rule\r\nthey married again soon after the dark cloud of bereavement had fallen\r\non them when the funeral baked meats have coldly furnished forth the\r\nmarriage tables it is better to remain as inconspicuous as possible\r\nfriends and onlookers will take notice and when they notice they\r\nwill talk moreover the new partner is often suspicious and apt to be a\r\nlittle jealous of his predecessor in title thus madame voisin being\r\nclever and discreet and her clients beingor at any rate appearing\r\nto behappy in their new relations and silent to the world at large\r\nall went prosperously with the kindlyhearted prophet no trouble rose\r\nas to testamentary dispositions men who are the subjects of prophecy\r\nhave usually excellentlydrawn wills this is especially the case with\r\nhusbands who are no longer young young husbands are as a rule not made\r\nthe subjects of prophecy\r\n\r\nmadame voisins great accuracy of prediction did not excite at the\r\ntime so much public admiration as it might have done if she or her\r\nclients had taken the public more into their confidence but it was\r\nnoted afterwards that in most cases the male individual who retired\r\nearly from the scene was the senior partner in that congeries of\r\nthree which has come to be known as the eternal triangle in later\r\nconversations following in the wake of the completed prophecy\r\nconfidences were exchanged as to the studies in certain matters\r\nof science in which madame voisin seemed to have attained a rare\r\nproficiency\r\n\r\nthe late mr charles peace an adventurous if acquisitive spirit who\r\ngave up his life in the same manner as the deceased mr haman worked\r\nalone during the long period of his professional existence and with\r\nmisleading safety the illustrious french ladyprophet unwisely did\r\nnot value this form of security and so multiplied opportunities of\r\nfailure she followed an entirely opposite policy one which though it\r\ndoubtless stood by her on many occasions had a fatal weakness in some\r\nways it may facilitate matters if one is ones own providence such\r\na course avoids temporarily errors of miscalculation or deduction of\r\nprobable results and just as the roulette table has certain chances\r\nin favour of zero there is for the practical prophet a large hazard\r\nin that the dead are unable to speak or to renew effort on a more\r\nfavourable basis la voisin probably through some unfavourable or\r\nthreatening experiences saw the wisdom of associating the forces of\r\nprediction and accomplishment and with the readiness of an active\r\npersonality effected the junction for this she was already fairly\r\nwell equipped with experiences both as a wife and a lover of warm\r\nand voluptuous nature she understood something of the passions of\r\nhumanity on both the female and the male side and being a woman she\r\nknew perhaps better of the two the potency of feminine longing this\r\ndid not act so strongly in the lesser and more directly commercial\r\nif less uncertain phases of her art such as finding lost property\r\ndivining the result of hazards effecting immunity from danger or the\r\npreserving indefinitely the more pleasing qualities of youth but in\r\nsterner matters when the issue was of life or death the masculine\r\ntendency towards recklessness kicked the beam as a nurse in active\r\ntouch with both medical and surgical wants aims and achievements\r\nshe was at ease in the larger risks of daily life and after all her\r\nown ambitions aided by the compelling of her own natural demands\r\nfor physical luxury were quite independent only seeking through\r\nexiguous means a way of achievement in secret she studied the mystery\r\nof a toxicologist and probably by cautious experiment satisfied\r\nherself of her proficiency in that littleknown science that she had\r\nother aims more or less dependent on this or the feelings which its\r\nknowledge superinduced can be satisfactorily guessed from some of her\r\nattendant labours which declared themselves later\r\n\r\nafter a time la voisins vogue as a sorceress brought her into\r\ncertain high society where freedom of action was unhampered by moral\r\nrestraints the very rich the leaders of society and fashion of the\r\ntime the unscrupulous whose ambitious efforts had been crowned with\r\nsuccess of a kind leaders of court life those in high military\r\ncommand mistresses of royalty and high aristocracyall became\r\ncompanions and clients in one or more of her mysterious arts amongst\r\nthem were the duchesse de bouillon the comtesse de soissons madame\r\nde montespan olympe de mancini marshal de luxembourg the duc de\r\nvendôme prince de clermontlodeve it was not altogether fashionable\r\nnot to be in touch with madame voisin undeterred by the lessons of\r\nhistory la voisin went on her way forced as is usual in such cases by\r\nthe circumstances which grow around the criminal and prove infinitely\r\nthe stronger she was at the height of her success when the public\r\nsuspicion followed by action revealed the terrible crimes of the\r\nmarquise de brinvilliers and she was caught in the tail of the tempest\r\nthus created\r\n\r\nthis case of madame de brinvilliers is a typical one of how a human\r\nbeing goaded by passion and lured by opportunity may fall swiftly\r\nfrom any estate it is so closely in touch with that of madame voisin\r\nthat the two have almost to be considered together they began with the\r\ndesire for dabbling in forbidden mysteries three mentwo italians\r\nand one german all men of some abilitywere violent searchers for\r\nthe mythical philosophers stone which was to fulfil the dream of\r\nthe mediæval alchemist by turning at will all things into gold in the\r\nsearch they all gravitated to paris there the usual thing happened\r\nmoney ran short and foolish hoping had to be supplemented by crime\r\nin the whirling world of the time there was always a ready sale for\r\nmeans to an end however nefarious either might be the easy morality\r\nof the time allowed opportunity for all means with the result that\r\nthere was an almost open dealing in poisons the soubriquet which stole\r\ninto existenceit dared not proclaim itselfis a selfexplanatory\r\nhistorical lesson the poudre de succession marks an epoch which\r\nfor sheer regardless remorseless profligate wickedness is almost\r\nwithout peer in history and this is said without forgetting the time\r\nof the borgias not even natural affection or family life or individual\r\nrelationship or friendliness was afforded any consideration this phase\r\nof crime which was one almost confined to the upper and wealthier\r\nclasses depended on wealth and laws of heredity and entail those who\r\nbenefited by it salved what remnants of conscience still remained to\r\nthem with the thought that they were but helping the natural process of\r\nwaste and recuperation the old and feeble were removed with as little\r\ncoil as might be necessary in order that the young and lusty might\r\nbenefit as the change was a form of plunder which had to be paid\r\nfor in a degree in some way approximate to results prices ran high\r\npoisoning on a successful scale requires skilful and daring agents\r\nwhose after secrecy as well as whose present aid has to be secured\r\nexili and glasserone of the italians and the germandid a thriving\r\ntrade as usual in such illicit traffic the possibility of purchase\r\nunder effective conditions made a market there is every reason to\r\nbelieve from after results that la voisin was one such agent the cause\r\nof la brinvilliers entering the market was the purely personal one of\r\nan affair of sensual passion death is an informative circumstance\r\nsuspicion began to leak out that the polyglot firm of needy foreigners\r\nhad dark dealings two of themthe italianswere arrested and sent to\r\nthe

regiment\r\nof the marquis had become intimate in his house brinvilliers was a\r\nfatuous person and of imperfect moral vision the captain was handsome\r\nand madame la marquise amorous behold then all the usual personnel\r\nof a tragedy of three after a while the intrigue became a matter of\r\nfamily concern the ladys fatherthe civil lieutenant daulroy\r\nprocured a lettre de cachet and had the erring lover immured in the\r\nbastille as the easiest and least public way out of the difficulty\r\nevil communications corrupt good manners says the proverb the\r\nproverbial philosopher understated the danger of such juxtaposition\r\nevil manners added corruption even to their kind in the bastille the\r\nexasperated lover listened to the wiles of exili and another stage\r\nof misdoing began the marquise determined on revenge and be sure\r\nthat in such a case in such a period even the massive walls of the\r\nbastille could not prevent the secret whisper of a means of effecting\r\nit daulroy his two sons and another sister perished brinvilliers\r\nhimself was spared through some bizarre freak of his wifes conscience\r\nthen the secret began to be whisperedfirst it was said through\r\nthe confessional and the chambre ardente analogous to the british\r\nstar chamber instituted for such purposes took the case in hand the\r\nresult might have been doubtful for great social forces were at work\r\nto hush up such a scandal but that with a truly seventeenth century\r\ncandour the prisoner had written an elaborate confession of her guilt\r\nwhich if it did not directly assure condemnation at least put justice\r\non the right track\r\n\r\nthe trial was a celebrated one and involved incidentally many\r\nillustrious persons as well as others of lesser note in the end in\r\n madame la marquise de brinvilliers was burnedthat is what was\r\nleft of her was burned after her head had been cut off a matter of\r\ngrace in consideration of her rank it is soothing to the feelings of\r\nmany relatives and friendsnot to mention those of the principalin\r\nsuch a case when great command oersways the order of purgation by\r\nfire\r\n\r\nbefore the eddy of the brinvilliers criminal scandal reached to the\r\nlower level of madame voisin a good many scandals were aired though\r\nagain great command seems to have been operative so far as human\r\npower availed in minimising both scandals and punishments amongst\r\nthose cited to the chambre ardente were two nieces of cardinal\r\nmazarin the duchesse de bouillon the comtesse de soissons and\r\nmarshal de luxembourg in some of these cases that which in theatrical\r\nparlance is called comic relief was not wanting it was a witty if\r\nimpertinent answer of the duchesse de bouillon to one of her judges\r\nla reyne an illfavoured man who asked apropos of a statement made\r\nat the trial that she had taken part in an alleged invocation of\r\nbeelzebub and did you ever see the devil\r\n\r\nyes i am looking at him now he is ugly and is disguised as a\r\ncouncillor of state\r\n\r\nthe king louis xiv took much interest in the trial and even tried\r\nnow and again to smooth matters he even went so far as to advise\r\nthe comtesse de soissons who was treated by the court rather as a\r\nfoolish than a guilty woman to keep out of the way if she were really\r\nguilty in answer she said with the haughtiness of her time that\r\nthough she was innocent she did not care to appear in a law court she\r\nwithdrew to brussels where she died some twenty years later marshal\r\nde luxembourgfrançois henri de montmorenciboutteville duke peer\r\nmarshal of france to give his full titleswas shown to have engaged in\r\nan attempt to recover lost property by occult means on which basis\r\nand for having once asked madame voisin to produce his satanic majesty\r\nhe was alleged to have sold himself to the devil but his occult\r\nadventures did not stand in the way of his promotion as a soldier\r\nthough he had to stand a trial of over a year long he was made captain\r\nof the guard and finally given command of the army\r\n\r\nla voisin with her accomplicesa woman named vigoureux and le sage\r\na priestwere with a couple of score of others arrested in  and\r\nwere after a spell of imprisonment in the bastille tried as a result\r\nvoisin vigoureux and her brother and le sage were burned early in\r\n in voisins case the mercy of previous decapitation which had\r\nbeen accorded to her guilty sister brinvilliers was not extended to\r\nher perhaps this was partly because of the attitude which she had\r\ntaken up with regard to religious matters amongst other unforgivable\r\nacts she had repelled the crucifixa terrible thing to do according to\r\nthe ideas of that superstitious age\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nd sir edward kelley\r\n\r\n\r\ncarlyle in his french revolution makes a contrast between two works\r\nof imagination which mark the extremes of the forces that made for\r\nthe disruption of france paul et virginie and le chevalier de\r\nfaublas the former he calls the swansong of old dying france of\r\nthe latter he says if this wretched faublas is a deathspeech it\r\nis one under the gallows and by a felon that does not repent this\r\ndouble analogy may well serve for a comparison of dr dee and the man\r\nwho was at once his partner for a time and his evil genius the grave\r\nearnest old scholar with instincts for good high endeavour and a\r\nvast intellectual strength contrasts well with the meansouled shifty\r\nspecious rogue who fastened himself on him and leechlike drained him\r\ndry as hay\r\n\r\nsuch historians as mention the existence of the latter are even a\r\nlittle doubtful how to spell his name this however does not matter\r\nmuchnay at all for it is probably not that to which he was born\r\nbriefly the following is his record as far as can be discovered he\r\nwas born in  to parents living in worcester who having tried\r\nto bring him up as an apothecary sent him to oxford when he was\r\nseventeen years of age there he was entered at gloucester hall\r\nunder the name of talbot as however three men of that name were in\r\nthe hall at the same time it is doubtful what family can claim the\r\nhonour of his kinship his college life was shortonly lasting a\r\nyearand inconspicuous he left we are told abruptly then as\r\nif to complete the purely educational phase of his existence he was\r\nfor a while an attorney eking out the tenuity of his legal practice\r\nby aid of forgery thus fullfledged for his work in life he made\r\nhis first properlyrecorded appearance in the pillory in  for\r\nan offence which is variously spoken of as forgery and coining at\r\nany rate his ears were cropped off a loss which necessitated for\r\nprudential reasons his wearing a skullcap for the remainder of his\r\ndays this he wore with such conspicuous success that it is said that\r\neven doctor dee who was his partner for nearly seven years did not\r\nknow of his mutilation kelleys next recorded offence was one which\r\nin a later age when subjects for dissection necessary for purposes of\r\neducation in anatomy were difficult to obtain was popularly known\r\nas bodysnatching the commission of this offence though a serious\r\nbreach of the law came to be regarded as a necessary condition of\r\nstudy and even if punishment was meted out it was not looked upon as\r\ndishonour but in kelleys case the offence was committed not for the\r\npurpose of scientific education but for one of sorcery it took place\r\nin waltonledale in lancashire where kelley dug up a body buried\r\non the previous day for purposes of necromancy which it will be\r\nremembered was as the etymology of the word implies divination by\r\nmeans of the dead\r\n\r\nfrom this time on he seemed to see his way clear to the final choice\r\nof a profession he had tasted crime and punishment and considered\r\nhimself well qualified to accept the risks as well as the benefits\r\nand so chose fraud as his life work he was still under twentyfive\r\nyears of age when he began to look about him for his next means\r\nor occasion of turning his special talents to profit after some\r\ndeliberation he fixed on the existence and qualities of the famous as\r\nhe had then become doctor dee and carefully commenced operations\r\nhe called on the mathematician at his house at mortlake and made his\r\nacquaintance dee was naturally impressed by the conversation and\r\nostensible qualities of the young man who had the plausibility of the\r\nborn rogue and laid himself out to captivate the old man more than\r\ndouble his companions age and worn by arduous study he fostered all\r\ndees natural weaknesses humoured his fads was enthusiastic regarding\r\nhis beliefs which he appeared to share and urged on his personal\r\nambitions the belief in occultism which the philosopher cherished\r\nin secret though he had openly and formally repudiated it a dozen\r\nyears before in his preface to sir henry billingsleys translation\r\nof euclid gave the parasitic rogue his cue for further ingratiating\r\nhimself and before long he entered dees service at an annual salary\r\nof fifty pounds his special function was that of skryer which\r\nwas his own or dees reading of seer his contribution to the\r\ngeneral result was to see the figures which didor did notappear\r\nin the socalled magic crystal an office for which his useful\r\nimagination his unblushing assurance and his utter unscrupulousness\r\neminently fitted him in fact he was in his designs of fraud a perfect\r\ncomplement of the simpleminded scientist of course as days went on\r\nand opportunities offered themselves through dees growing madness\r\nand kelleys social enlargements the horizon of chicanery widened\r\nthis was largely assisted by the opportune arrival in england of the\r\npalatine albert laski in  laski was just the man that kelley was\r\nwaiting for a rich man with a taste for occult science sufficiently\r\nlearned to keep in touch with the theories of occultism of that time\r\nsufficiently vain to be used by an unscrupulous adventurer who tickled\r\nhis intellectual palate whilst he matured his frauds upon him\r\n\r\nkelley having worked on dees feelings sufficiently to secure his\r\nacquiescence procured that laski should be allowed to aid in such\r\noperations and experiments as appealed to him the result was that the\r\npalatine took the two men with him promising a free field for them\r\nboth each according to his bent at prague in  laski presented\r\ndee and his companion to the emperor rudolph ii encouraged by the\r\nroyal approval dee looked for a longer sojourn in eastern europe and\r\nbrought thither his wife and children from poland where he had left\r\nthem at laskoe the seat of the palatine later on in again\r\nthrough the influence of the credulous laskidee with his companion\r\nwas presented to stephen king of poland stephen was much interested\r\nand attended a séance that he might see the spirits of which he\r\nhad heard so much he saw too much however as far as kelley was\r\nconcerned for he penetrated the imposture thereupon kelley unequal\r\nto carrying on the business singlehanded for he dared not let dees\r\neyes be opened and he knew he could not induce him to be other than\r\na blind partner contrived that a new confederate should be added to\r\nthe firm this was one francis pucci a florentine possessed of all\r\nthe address and subtlety of his race but after the experience of a\r\nyear he was removed on suspicion of bad faith before that year was\r\nout the bishop of piacenza apostolic nuncio at the emperors court\r\nhad a decree issued that the two englishmen should quit prague within\r\nsix days from prague they went to erfurt in thuringia but despite\r\nletters of recommendation from high quarters the municipal authorities\r\nwould not allow them to remain so they moved on to hessecassel and\r\nthence to tribau in bohemia where the fraud of making spirits appear\r\nwas renewed in  it was intimated to dee that the emperor of\r\nrussia wished to receive him in that country he would receive a fee of\r\ntwo thousand pounds per annum and would be treated with honour but the\r\nscholar did not see his way to accept the flattering offer at tribau\r\nkelley experimented but unsuccessfully with some powder found at\r\nglastonbury dees young son being the medium it was noticeable that\r\nwhenever dee or his family failed in these experiments kelley always\r\nsucceeded at this stage kelley who was a man of evil life fell madly\r\nin love with dees wife he was married himself but that did not seem\r\nto matter his own wife was ugly and unattractive whereas the second\r\nmrs dee was wellfavoured and winning in the madness of his lust\r\nhe tried to work on the husbands credulity by telling him that it\r\nhad been conveyed to him through angels that it was the divine wish\r\nthat the two men should hold their wives in common dee was naturally\r\nsceptical and annoyed and his wife was furious kelley however was\r\npersistent and stuck to his point so stedfastly that after a while\r\nthe womans resolution began to give way and for a time some sort of\r\nworking arrangement came about kelleys story as elaborated to his\r\npartner was that at tribau in  the crystal showed him a vision\r\nof a naked woman who conveyed to him the divine message to dees\r\nunhinged mind this seemed all natural and correctprobably even to\r\nthe suitable costume adopted by the angelic messenger so the worthy\r\ndoctor gave way after a time however the matron recovered her sanity\r\nand the vulture and the pigeon parted dee gave up to his late partner\r\nall the tools of trade and properties of the fraud and the two\r\nnever met again\r\n\r\nkelley went to prague where he was thrown into prison in  he\r\nremained in durance for four years after which he was released from\r\nthence on till  he became a vagabond as well as a rogue and\r\nwandered about germany he again fell into the hands of rudolph to be\r\nagain imprisoned by him he was killed whilst making a desperate effort\r\nto escape\r\n\r\nthere seems to be no record of edward kelleyor talbothaving been\r\nknighted no authority save his own wish for the use of the title it\r\nmay of course be possible that he was knighted by the emperor in some\r\nmoment of absurd credulity but there is no record of it he had no\r\nchildren\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ne mother damnable\r\n\r\n\r\nowing to a want of accord among historians the searcher after historic\r\ntruth in our own day can hardly be quite sure of the identity of the\r\nworthy lady who passed under the above enchanting title to later\r\ngenerations the district of camden townformerly a suburb of london\r\nbut now a fairly central part of itis best known through a public\r\nhouse the mother redcap but before controversy can cease we are\r\ncalled on to decide if mother redcap and mother damnable were one\r\nand the same person a hundred years ago a writer who had made such\r\nsubjects his own came to the conclusion that the soubriquet mother\r\ndamnable was synonymous with mother blackcap whom he spoke of as of\r\nlocal fame but in the century that has elapsed historical research has\r\nbeen more scientifically organised and the field from which conclusions\r\ncan be drawn has been enlarged as well as explored the fact is that\r\na century ago the northern suburb had two wellknown public houses\r\nmother redcap and mother blackcap it is possible that both the\r\nworthy vintners who offered entertainment for man and beast meant one\r\nand the same person though who that person was remains to be seen\r\nthe distinctive colour line of the two hostelries was also possibly\r\ndue to considerations of business rather than of art redcap and\r\nblackcap are as names drawn from these varying signboards the\r\nterm mother held in common is simply a title given without any\r\npretence of doing honour to the alleged practices of the person whom it\r\nis intended to designate\r\n\r\nthere were in fact two notorious witches either of whom might have\r\nbeen in the mind of either artistic designer one was of yorkshire\r\nfame in the time of henry vii the other was of very much later date\r\nand of purely local notoriety the two publicans who exploited these\r\nidentities under pictorial garb were open and avowed trade rivals\r\nthe earlier established of the two had evidently commissioned a\r\npainter to create a striking signboard on a given subject and the\r\nartist had fulfilled his task by an alleged portrait of sufficiently\r\nfearsome import to fix the attention of the passerby at the same time\r\nconveying to him some hint of the calling of the archetype on which\r\nher fame was based prosperity in the venture begot rivalry and the\r\nowner of the new house of refreshment wishing to outshine his rival\r\nin trade whilst at the same time availing himself of the publicity and\r\nlocal fame already achieved commissioned another artist to commit\r\nanother pictorial atrocity under the name of art so far as the purpose\r\nof publicity went the ideas were similar the only differences\r\nbeing in the colour scheme and the measure of attractiveness of the\r\nalleged prototype from the indications thus given one may form some\r\nopinionbased solely on probabilityas to which was the earlier and\r\nwhich the later artistic creation for it is by this meansand this\r\nmeans onlythat we may after the lapse of at least a century bring\r\ntradition to our aid and guess at the original of mother damnable\r\n\r\nof the two signs it seems probable that the black one is the older\r\nafter all the main purpose of a signboard is to catch the eye\r\nand unless titian and all who followed him are wrong red has an\r\nattractive value beyond all other hues the dictum of the great italian\r\nis unassailable red catches the eye yellow holds it blue gives\r\ndistance a freesouled artist with the choice of the whole palette\r\nopen to him might choose black since historical accuracy was a matter\r\nto be valued but in a question of competition a painter would wisely\r\nchoose redespecially when his rival had confined himself to black\r\nso far as attractiveness is concerned it must be borne in mind that\r\nthe object of the painter and his patron was to bring customers to a\r\nlondon suburban public house in the days of george iii today there is\r\na cult of horrors in paris which has produced some choice specimens of\r\ndecorative art such for instance as the café known as le rat mort\r\n\r\nsuch places lure their customers by curiosity and sheer horror but the\r\npersons lured are from a class dominated by gallic effervescence and\r\nattracted by anything that is bizarre and not of the class of the\r\nstolid beerdrinking briton but even the most stolid of men is pleased\r\nby the beauty of a woman so the signpainterwho knows his art well\r\nand has evolved from the ranks of his calling such a man as franz\r\nhalswe may be sure when he wished to please took for his model some\r\ngracious personality\r\n\r\nnow the artist of the lady of dark headgear let his imagination run\r\nfree and produced a face typical of all the sins of the decalogue we\r\nmay therefore take it on the ground of form as well as that of colour\r\nthat priority of date is to be given to mother blackcap there is\r\ngood ground for belief that this deduction is correct naturally the\r\nowner of the earliest publichouse wished to make it as attractive as\r\npossible and as camden town was a suburb through which the northern\r\ntraffic passed on its way to and from london it was wise to use\r\nfor publicity and entertainment names that were familiar to north\r\ncountry ears before the railways were organised the great wheeled\r\nand horsetraffic between london and the northespecially yorkshire\r\nwhich was one of the first counties to take up manufacturing and had\r\nalready most of the wool tradewent through camden town so it was\r\nwise forethought to take as an inn sign a yorkshire name the name\r\nof mother shipton had been in mens mouths and ears for about two\r\nhundred years and as the times had so changed that the old stigma of\r\nwitchcraft was not then understood the association of the name with\r\nknaresborough alone remained and so mother shipton of knaresborough\r\nwas intended as the prototype of the inn portrait with black headgear\r\nat camden town in the ordinary course of development and business one\r\nof the two inns succeeded and lasted better than the other and as\r\nmother redcap has as a name supplanted mother damnable we may with\r\nsome understanding discuss who that lady was\r\n\r\nshe was a wellknown shrew of kentish town daughter of one jacob\r\nbingham a local brickmaker who had married the daughter of a scotch\r\npedlar manifestly not of any high moral character as shown by her\r\nlater acts and the general mistrust which attended them they had\r\none daughter jinny who in wickedness outdid her parents she was\r\nnaturally warmblooded and had a child when she was sixteen by a man of\r\nno account george coulter

disappeared but his body\r\nburned almost to a cinder was discovered in a neighbouring oven jinny\r\nwas tried for murder but escaped on the plea that the man often took\r\nrefuge in the oven when he

overt\r\nviolence of demeanour attributed to her she did not even receive any\r\nof the respect usually shown to a freeholderwhich she was having\r\nby her fathers death become owner of a house which he had built for\r\nhimself with his own hands on waste ground her only protector was that\r\nusual favourite of witches a black cat whose devotion to her and\r\nwhose savage nature accompanied by the

oppression in the shape of\r\nwrongdoing and that is oppression in the guise of good tennyson\r\nin one of his poems speaks of the dishonest pharmacist who pestles\r\na poisond poison this is a refinement of iniquity a poisoned\r\npoison is not even an enlargement of evil but a structural change\r\neliminating the intention of good and replacing it with evil intent\r\nwitches were quite bad enough or rather they would have been had that\r\nwhich was alleged of them been true but a man who got his living by\r\ncreating suspicion regarding them and following it out to the practical\r\nconsummation of a hideous death was a thousand times worse today\r\nsuch a functionary as a witchfinder exists it is true but only\r\namongst the very lowest and most debased savages and it is only by the\r\nrecorded types made known to us that it is possible even to guess at\r\nthe iniquity of their measures the vileness of their actions in the\r\nfull tally of the two centuries during which the witch mania existed\r\nin england it is impossible to parallel the baseness of the one man\r\nwho distinguished himself in this loathsome occupation the facts of\r\nhis history speak for themselves matthew hopkins was born in suffolk\r\nearly in the seventeenth century he was the son of a minister james\r\nhopkins of wenham he was brought up for the law and when enrolled\r\nas an attorney practised in ipswich but after a while he moved to\r\nmanningtree where after he had given up the law he took to the\r\ncalling of witchfinder being the first person in england to follow\r\nthat honourable trade\r\n\r\nif he had had no suitable opportunities of earning an honest livelihood\r\nand been graced with no education some excuse might have been offered\r\nfor his despicable calling but when we remember that he passed his\r\nyouth in a household practising religion and was a member of a learned\r\nprofession it is difficult to find words sufficiently comprehensive\r\nfor the fit expression of our natural indignation against him if\r\npicturesque profanity were allowable it might be well applied to\r\nthis despicable wretch and his nefarious labours in no imaginable\r\ncircumstances could there possibly be anything to be said in mitigation\r\nof his infamy when we think that the whole ritual of oppression was\r\nin his own handsthat he began with lying and perjury and ended with\r\nmurder that he showed throughout ruthless callousness for the mental\r\nand physical torture of great numbers of the most helpless class of\r\nthe community the poor the weak the suffering the helpless and\r\nhopeless that when once his foul imagination had consecrated any poor\r\nwretch to destruction or his baleful glance had unhappily lighted\r\non some unsuspecting victim there was for such only the refuge of\r\ndeath and that by some means of prolonged torture we cannot find\r\nany hope or prospect even in evil dreams of the nether world of any\r\nadequate punishment for his dreadful sins when we remember that this\r\none manif man he can be calledwas in himself responsible for what\r\namounted to the murder of some two hundred women whom he pursued to the\r\ndeath the magnitude of his guilt can be guessed but not realised\r\n\r\nhe occupied three whole years in his fell work and in those years\r\n  and  he caused a regular reign of terror throughout\r\nthe counties of huntingdon norfolk suffolk and essex he had a gang\r\nof his own to help him in his gruesome work of discovering witches\r\namongst whom was a wretch called john stern andto her shamea woman\r\nwhose name is unrecorded these three had a sort of mock assize of\r\ntheir own they made regular tours of discovery at a charge of twenty\r\nshillings for expenses at each place they visited there appears to\r\nhave been a fee paid or exacted for each witch bagged and such was\r\nhis greed that after a while he actually lowered the price in \r\nwhich was perhaps his best year the price declined to a shilling\r\na head hopkins and his gang took comfort however from the fact\r\nthat the industry was a growing one the trade had only been initiated\r\nin  and already in a years time he had in one day procured\r\nthe execution of eighteen alleged witches and at the end of that\r\nassize after the gaol delivery had been effected one hundred and\r\ntwenty suspects still awaited trial in the skilful hands of matthew\r\nhopkins trial was only a step on the road to certain execution by one\r\nof the forms in use here came in not only the witchfinders legal\r\nknowledge but also his gift of inventionthe latter being used in the\r\nformulation of socalled tests which were bound to be effective of\r\nthese the simplest was the water test the subjects thumbs were tied\r\ntogether and she was then thrown into water of sufficient depth if she\r\ndid not drown it was taken as a proof of guilt and she was hanged\r\nby form of law in some cases as an alternative she was burned if\r\nshe did not stand the test her friends had the pleasure of knowing\r\nthat she was pronounced to have died innocent in any case there was\r\nno further trouble with her such was the accuracy as well as the\r\nsimplicity of similar tests that in the twenty years previous to the\r\nrestoration between three and four thousand alleged witches perished\r\nin england from one cause or another hopkins professed to be both\r\njust and merciful he seemed generally willing to afford a test to\r\nthe accused though truth to tell the result was always the same\r\nin such cases the test was eminently calculated to evoke confession\r\nand such confession no matter how ridiculous or extravagant it\r\nmight be was simply a curved road to the rope or the torch instead\r\nof a straight one one of these pleasing tests was to place the\r\nold womanthey were all women and all oldsitting crosslegged on\r\na stool or table where she could be well watched she was generally\r\nkept in that position under inspection without food or water for\r\ntwentyfour hours at the end of that time such resolution as had\r\nremained disappeared and in the vain blind hope of some change for the\r\nbetter some alleviation however slight of the grinding misery of the\r\nagony of body and mind and soul they confessed and such confessions\r\nthe very consideration of such of them as now remain in the cold\r\nthirdperson method of a mere recorder almost makes one weep there\r\nis hardly a word that is not almost a certificate of character with\r\nevery desire to confessfor such was the last hope of pleasing their\r\ntorturerstheir utter ignorance of confessional matter is almost a\r\nproof of innocence\r\n\r\njust imagine the scenea village or hamlet or the poorer quarter\r\nof a small country town with squalid surroundings marking a poverty\r\nwhich in this age has no equal a poor old lonely woman whose long\r\nlife of sordid misery of hunger and the diseases that huddle closely\r\naround want hopeless despairing recognising her fate through the\r\nprolonged physical torture with

rally such glimmerings of invention as\r\nare possible to her untaught unfed mind but finds herself at every\r\nfailure fluttering helplessly against a wall of spiritual granite which\r\ngives back not even an echo to her despairing cry at last she comes\r\nto that stage where even fright and fear have no standing room and\r\nwhere the blank misery of suffering ceases to be effective then the\r\nlast flicker of desire for truth or rectitude of purpose dies away and\r\nshe receives in feeble acquiescence such suggestions as are shouted\r\nor whispered to her in the hope that by accepting them she may win a\r\nmoments ease of body or mind even if it be her last on earth driven\r\nbeyond mortal limits her untutored mind gives way and with the last\r\nremnants of her strength

through his influence his teaching\r\nthe expression of his honest conviction was the cause of perhaps more\r\ndeaths than the english antiwitch we refer to cotton mather who\r\nbelieved he wrought for the lordin his own wayin new england but\r\nguilt does not attach to him he was an earnest though mistaken man\r\nand the results of his mistaken teaching were at variance with the\r\ntrend of his kindly godly life\r\n\r\nit must be pleasing to the spirit of the old adam which is in us\r\nall in some form to think of the manner of the death of matthew\r\nhopkins three years had exhausted not

the filthiest thing in connection with\r\nit not content with dealing with the poor helpless folk whom he\r\nhad come to regard as his natural prey he went on fancy flights of\r\noppression at last he went too far he ventured to denounce an aged\r\nclergyman of blameless life the witchfever was too strong for justice\r\nin any form and neither age high character nor sacred office could\r\nprotect this gentleman of eighty years of age he too was tortured\r\ntill in a moment of unhinged mind he confessed as he was ordered\r\nand was duly hanged this was in  the old mans death was not in\r\nvain for it was made the occasion of much necessary plain speaking\r\npresently the public conscience was wakened chiefly by another cleric\r\nthe rev john caule vicar of great staughton huntingdonshireall\r\nhonour to himwho though strange to say he believed in witchcraft\r\nrealised the greater evil wrought by men like hopkins he published\r\na pamphlet in which he denounced hopkins as a common nuisance the\r\nresult if slow was sure the witchfinder never recovered from the\r\nshock of caules vigorous attack in  on information based on\r\nhopkins own rules he was arrested and subjected to the test which\r\nhe had devised he was tied by the thumbs and thrown into the water\r\nunfortunately for himself he withstood the testdrowning except for a\r\nshort period of pangs is an easy deathand so was by process of law\r\nduly hanged\r\n\r\none can imagine how the whole atmosphere of the countrysurcharged\r\nwith suspicion fear oppression torture perjury or crimewas\r\ncleared

claimant to the\r\nrich estates and title of tichborne takes a foremost place not only\r\nas the originator of one of the most colossal attempts at fraud on\r\nrecord but also from his remarkable success in duping the public it\r\nwould be difficult indeed to furnish a more striking example of the\r\nheight to which the blind credulity of people will occasionally attain\r\nof pretenders who by pertinacious and unscrupulous lying have sought\r\nto bolster up fictitious claims there have been many before orton\r\nbut he certainly surpassed all his predecessors in working out the\r\nlie circumstantial in such a way as to divide the country for years\r\ninto two great partiesthose who believed in the claimant and those\r\nwho did not over one hundred persons drawn from every class and\r\nfor the most part honest in their belief swore to the identity of\r\nthis illiterate butchers sonthis stockman mailrider and probably\r\nbushranger and thiefas the longlost son and heir of the ancient\r\nhouse of tichborne of titchborne to gain his own selfish ends this\r\nindividual was ready to rob a gentlewoman of her fair fame to destroy\r\nthe peace of a great family who to free themselves from a persecution\r\nas cruel as it was vicious had to be pilloried before a ruthless and\r\nunsympathising mob to have the privacy of their home invaded and\r\nto hear their womens names banded from one coarse mouth to another\r\nthus and through no fault of their own they were compelled to endure\r\na mental torture far worse than any physical suffering besides having\r\nto expend vast sums of money as well as time and labour in order to\r\nprotect themselves from the wouldbe depredations of an unscrupulous\r\nadventurer it has been estimated that the resistance of this\r\nfictitious claim cost the tichborne estate not far short of one hundred\r\nthousand pounds\r\n\r\nillustration\r\n\r\n    photo by maull  fox copyright\r\n\r\narthur orton\r\n\r\nthe baronetcy of tichborne now doughtytichborne is one of the\r\noldest it has been claimed that the family held possession of the\r\nmanor of tichborne for two hundred years before the conquest be\r\nthis as it mayand in the light of j h rounds revelations some\r\nscepticism as to these prenorman pedigrees is permissibletheir\r\nancestors may be traced back to one walter de tichborne who held the\r\nmanor from which he took his name as early as  their names too\r\nare interwoven with the history of the country sir benjamin the first\r\nbaronetfor the earlier de tichbornes were knightsas sheriff of\r\nsouthhampton on the death of queen elizabeth repaired instantly\r\nto winchester and on his own initiative proclaimed the accession of\r\njames vi of scotland as king of england for which service he was made\r\na baronet and his four sons received the honour of knighthood his\r\nsuccessor sir richard was a zealous supporter of the royal cause\r\nduring the civil wars sir henry the third baronet hazarded his life\r\nin the defence of charles i and had his estates sequestered by the\r\nparliamentarians though he was recompensed at the restoration\r\n\r\nbelievers in occultism might see in the trials and tribulations\r\nbrought down upon the unfortunate heads of the tichborne family by the\r\nmachinations of the claimant the realisation of the doom pronounced by\r\na certain dame ticheborne away back in the days of henry ii\r\n\r\nsir roger de ticheborne of those days married mabell the daughter and\r\nheiress of ralph de lamerston of lamerston in the isle of wight by\r\nwhom he acquired that estate this good wife played the part of lady\r\nbountiful of the neighbourhood after a life spent in acts of charity\r\nand goodness as her end drew nigh and she lay on her death bed her\r\nthoughts went out to her beloved poor she begged her husband that in\r\norder to have her memory kept green the countryside round he would\r\ngrant a bequest sufficient to ensure once a year a dole of bread to\r\nall comers to the gates of tichborne to gratify her whim sir roger\r\npromised her as much land as she could encompass while a brand plucked\r\nfrom the fire should continue to burn as the poor lady had been\r\nbedridden for years her husband may have had no idea that she could\r\neven if she would take his promise seriously however the venerable\r\ndame after being carried out upon the ground seemed to regain her\r\nstrength in a miraculous fashion and to the surprise of all managed\r\nto crawl round several rich and goodly acres which to this day are\r\nknown as the crawls\r\n\r\ncarried to her bed again after making this last supreme effort and\r\nsummoning her family to her bedside lady ticheborne predicted with her\r\ndying breath that as long as this annual dole was continued so long\r\nshould the house of tichborne prosper but should it be neglected\r\ntheir fortunes would fail and the family name become extinct from want\r\nof male issue as a sure sign by which these disasters might be looked\r\nfor she foretold that a generation of seven sons would be immediately\r\nfollowed by one of seven daughters\r\n\r\nthe benevolent custom thus established was faithfully observed for\r\ncenturies on every lady day crowds of humble folk came from near\r\nand far to partake of the famous dole which consisted of hundreds of\r\nsmall loaves but ultimately the occasion degenerated into a noisy\r\nmerrymaking a sort of fair until it was finally discontinued in\r\n owing to the complaints of the magistrates and local gentry that\r\nthe practice encouraged vagabonds gipsies and idlers of all sorts to\r\nswarm into the neighbourhood under pretence of receiving the dole\r\n\r\nstrangely enough sir henry tichborne the baronet of that day the\r\noriginal name of de ticheborne had by this time been reduced to\r\ntichborne had seven sons while his eldest son who succeeded him in\r\n had seven daughters the extinction of the family name too\r\ncame to pass for in the absence of male issue sir henry the eighth\r\nbaronet was succeeded by his brother who had taken the surname of\r\ndoughty on coming into the estates bequeathed to him on these terms by\r\na distant relative miss doughty though in after years his brother\r\nwho in turn succeeded him obtained the royal licence to couple the\r\nold family name with that of doughty following this repeated lapse of\r\ndirect male heirs came other troubles but it is to be hoped that the\r\nsuccessful defeat of the fraudulent claim of arthur orton set a period\r\nto the doom pronounced long years ago by the lady mabell\r\n\r\nmost families great and small have their secret troubles and\r\nunpleasantness and the tichbornes seem to have had their share of\r\nthem to this may be traced the actual if remote cause of the\r\nclaimants imposture james tichborne afterwards the tenth baronet\r\nthe father of the missing roger who was drowned in the mysterious\r\nloss of the bella off the coast of south america in the spring of\r\n lived abroad for many years but while his wife was french in\r\nevery sentiment he himself from time to time exhibited a keen desire\r\nto return to his native land when roger was born there was small\r\nlikelihood of his ever succeeding to either title or estates and so\r\nhis education was almost entirely a foreign one\r\n\r\nsir henry tichborne who had succeeded in  though blessed with\r\nseven beautiful daughters had no son still there was their uncle\r\nedward who had taken the name of doughty and he after sir henry\r\nwas the next heir edward too had a son and daughter but one day\r\nnews came to james and his wife in france that their little nephew\r\nwas dead and with the possibilities which this change opened up it\r\nbrought home to the father the error he had committed in permitting\r\nroger to grow up ignorant of the english tongue and habits it was\r\nmanifest that mr james f tichborne was not unlikely to become the\r\nnext baronet and he felt it his bounden duty to make good his previous\r\nneglect by providing his son with an english education such as would\r\nfit him for his probable position as head of the house of tichborne\r\nin this praiseworthy intention he met with strong opposition from his\r\nwife whose great aim it was to see her son grow up a frenchman to her\r\nfrance was the only land worth living in she cared nought for family\r\ntraditions her dream was that her darling boy should marry into some\r\ndistinguished family in france or italy if he was to enter the army\r\nthen it should be in some foreign service but to england he should\r\nnot go if she could prevent it\r\n\r\njames tichborne like many weak men with selfwilled wives put off\r\nthe inevitable day as long as he could and in the end only achieved\r\nhis purpose by strategy roger was sixteen years of age when news\r\narrived of the death of sir henry naturally james arranged to be\r\npresent at his brothers funeral and it was only reasonable that he\r\nshould be accompanied by his son roger whom everyone now regarded as\r\nthe heir accordingly the boy took leave of his mother but under the\r\nsolemn injunction to return quickly however his father had determined\r\notherwise after attending the funeral of his uncle at the old chapel\r\nat tichborne roger was by the advice of relatives and friends and\r\nwith the consent of the boy himself taken down to the jesuit college\r\nat stonyhurst when mrs tichborne learned of this step her fury knew\r\nno bounds she upbraided her husband violently and there was a renewal\r\nof the old scenes in the tichborne establishment roger wrote his\r\nmother filial if illspelt letters in french but for a year the\r\nson though ardently looking for a letter got no token of affection\r\nfrom the incensed and indignant lady\r\n\r\nduring his three years stay at stonyhurst roger seems to have applied\r\nhimself diligently to the study of english but though he made fair\r\nprogress he was never able to speak it with as much purity and\r\ncommand of words as when conversing in french in latin mathematics\r\nand chemistry too he contrived to make fair headway while his\r\nletters evidenced an inclination for the study of polite literature\r\nif not highly accomplished he was of a refined and sensitive nature\r\nduring this period he made many friends spending his vacation with his\r\nenglish relatives in turn his great delight was to stay at tichborne\r\nthen in possession of his fathers brother sir edward doughty withal\r\nthe shy palefaced boy steadily gained in favour for he had a nature\r\nwhich disarmed illfeeling as time wore on it became necessary to\r\ndetermine on some profession for the lad and needless to say his\r\nfathers choice of the army added fuel to the fire of his wifes anger\r\nafter some delay a commission was obtained and mr roger charles\r\ntichborne was gazetted a coronet in the sixth dragoons better known as\r\nthe carbineers\r\n\r\ndefeated in her purpose of making a frenchman of her boy rogers\r\nmother yet continued to harp upon her old desire to marry him to one\r\nof the italian princesses of whom he had heard so much but roger\r\nhad other ideas for he had fallen passionately in love with his\r\ncousinmiss katharine doughty afterwards lady radcliffe however the\r\ncourse of love was not to run smooth the tichbornes had always been\r\nroman catholic and the marriage of first cousins was discountenanced\r\nby that church consequently when some little token incidentally\r\nrevealed to the father the secret and yet unspoken love of the young\r\npeople their dream was rudely shattered\r\n\r\nthat the girl warmly reciprocated her cousins affection was beyond\r\nquestion and lady doughty was certainly sympathetic though she took\r\nexception to certain of her nephews habits he was an inveterate\r\nsmoker besides drinking too freely these and other little failings\r\nseem to have aroused some fear in her anxious mothers heart though\r\nshe quite recognised the boys kind disposition and the fact that he\r\nwas truthful honourable and scrupulous in points of duty still she\r\nwould not oppose the wishes of the young loversexcept to the extent\r\nof pleading and encouraging roger to master his weaknesses it was\r\nchristmas time in  when the dénoument came and the eyes of sir\r\nedward were opened to what was going on he was both vexed and angry\r\nand was resolved that the engagement should be broken off before it\r\ngrew more serious one last interview was permitted to the cousins\r\nand this over the young man was to leave the house forever the\r\ngreat hope of his life extinguished there was nothing left for roger\r\nbut to rejoin his regiment then expecting orders for india and to\r\nendeavour to forget the past still even in those dark days neither\r\nroger nor kate quite gave up hope of some change lady doughty despite\r\nher dread of her nephews habits had a warm regard for him and could\r\nbe relied upon to plead his cause and in a short time circumstances\r\nunexpectedly favoured him sir edward was ill and fearing that death\r\nwas approaching he sent for his nephew and revived the subject he\r\nexplained that if it were not for the close relationship he should\r\nhave no objection to the marriage and begged roger to wait for three\r\nyears if then the affection one for the other remained unaltered\r\nand providing that roger obtained his own fathers consent and that\r\nof the church he would accept things as the will of god and agree to\r\nthe union as might be expected roger gratefully promised loyally to\r\nobserve the sick mans wishes\r\n\r\nhowever sir edward instead of dying slowly mended and roger\r\nreturned to his regiment occasionally he would spend his leave with\r\nhis aunt and uncle when the young people loved to walk together in the\r\nbeautiful gardens of tichborne exchanging sweet confidences and weaving\r\nplans for the future on what proved to be his last visit to his\r\nancestral home in the midsummer of  roger to comfort his cousin\r\nconfided a secret to hera copy of a vow which he had written out and\r\nsigned solemnly pledging himself in the event of their being married\r\nbefore three years had passed to build a church or chapel at tichborne\r\nas a thanks offering to the holy virgin for the protection shown by her\r\nin praying god that their wishes might be fulfilled\r\n\r\nhis leave up roger went back to his regiment more than ever a prey\r\nto his habitual melancholy to his great regret the orders for the\r\ncarbineers to go to india were countermanded he accordingly determined\r\nto throw up his commission and travel abroad until his period of\r\nprobation had passed south america had long been the subject of his\r\ndreams and so thither he would make his way and in travelling through\r\nthat vast continent he hoped to find occupation for his mind and so get\r\nthrough the trying period of waiting his plan was to spend a year in\r\nchili guayaquil and peru and thence to visit mexico and so by way\r\nof the united states to return home having come to this resolution\r\nhe lost no time in putting it into execution being of businesslike\r\nhabits he made his will in which he purposely omitted any mention\r\nof the church or chapel this secret had already been committed to\r\npaper and with other precious souvenirs of his love for his cousin\r\nhad been confided to his most trusted friendmr gosford the steward\r\nof the family estate after paying a round of farewell visits to his\r\nparents and old friends in paris roger finally set sail from havre on\r\nmarch   in a french vessel named la pauline for valparaiso\r\nat which port she arrived on the th of the following june when roger\r\nset out on his wanderings during his travels roger continued to write\r\nhome regularly but the first news he received was bad sir edward\r\ndoughty had died almost before the pauline had lost sight of the\r\nenglish shores and rogers father and mother were now sir james and\r\nlady tichborne\r\n\r\npresently the wanderer began to retrace his steps making his way to\r\nrio de janeiro here he found a vessel called the bella hailing from\r\nliverpool about to sail for kingston jamaica and as he had directed\r\nhis letters and remittances to be forwarded there he prevailed upon\r\nthe captain to give him a passage on the th of april  the\r\nbella passed from the port of rio into the ocean from that day no\r\none ever set eyes upon her six days after she left harbour a ship\r\ntraversing her path found amongst other ominous tokens of a wreck a\r\ncapsized longboat bearing the name bella liverpool\r\n\r\nthese were taken into rio and forthwith the authorities caused the\r\nneighbouring seas to be scoured in quest of survivors but none were\r\never found that the bella had foundered there was little room to\r\ndoubt it was supposed that she had been caught in a sudden squall\r\nthat her cargo had shifted and that unable to right herself the\r\nvessel had gone down in deep water giving but little warning to those\r\non board in a few months the sad news reached tichborne where the\r\nabsence of letters from the previously diligent correspondent had\r\nalready raised grave fears the sorrowstricken father caused enquiries\r\nto be made in america and elsewhere for a time there was a faint hope\r\nthat some one aboard the bella might have been picked up by some\r\npassing vessel but as months wore on even these small hopes dwindled\r\naway the letters which poor roger had so anxiously asked might be\r\ndirected to him at the post office kingston jamaica remained there\r\ntill the ink grew faded the bankers bill which lay at the agents\r\nremained unclaimed at last the unfortunate vessel was finally written\r\noff at lloyds as lost the insurance money paid and gradually the\r\nbella faded from the memories of all but those who had lost friends\r\nor relatives in her lady tichborne alone refused to abandon hope\r\n\r\nher obstinate disregard of such conclusive evidence of the fate of her\r\nunfortunate son preyed upon her mind to such an extent as to make her\r\nan easy victim for any scheming rascal pretending to have news of her\r\nlost son and sailors who told all sorts of wild stories of how\r\nsome of the survivors of the bella had been rescued and landed in a\r\nforeign port became constant visitors at tichborne park and profited\r\nhandsomely from the weakminded ladys credulity sir james himself\r\nmade short work of these tramping sailors but after his death\r\nin  the lady became even more ready to be victimised by their\r\nspecious lies\r\n\r\nfirm in her belief that roger was still alive lady tichborne now\r\ncaused advertisements to be inserted in numerous papers and in\r\nnovember  she learnt through an agency in sydney that a man\r\nanswering the description of her son had been found in wagga wagga\r\nnew south wales a long correspondence ensued the tone and character\r\nof which ought to have put her on her guard but overanxious to\r\nbelieve that she had indeed found her longlost son any wavering\r\ndoubts she may have had were swept from her mind by the evidence of\r\nan aged negro servant named boyle an old pensioner of the tichborne\r\nfamily boyle who lived in new south wales professed to recognise the\r\nclaimant as his dear young master and he certainly remained one of his\r\nmost devoted adherents to the end undoubtedly this mans simplicity\r\nproved a very valuable asset to orton his intimate knowledge of the\r\narrangements of tichborne park was pumped dry by his new master who\r\naided by a most tenacious memory was afterwards able to use the\r\ninformation thus obtained with startling effect\r\n\r\nas to the identity of the claimant with arthur orton there can be\r\nabsolutely no doubt as a result of the enquiries made by the trustees\r\nof the tichborne estate nearly the whole of his history was unmasked\r\nhe was born in  at wapping where his father kept a butchers\r\nshop in  he took passage to valparaiso whence he made his way up\r\ncountry to melipilla here he stayed some eighteen months receiving\r\nmuch kindness from a family named castro and it was their name he\r\nwent under at wagga wagga in  he returned home and entering his\r\nfathers business became an expert slaughterman the following year\r\nhe emigrated to australia but after the spring of  he ceased to\r\ncorrespond with his family he had evidently led a life of hardship\r\nand adventureprobably not unattended with crime and certainly with\r\npoverty at wagga wagga he carried on a small butchers business and\r\nit was from here that he got into communication with lady tichborne\r\njust after his marriage to an illiterate servant girl\r\n\r\naccording to his subsequent confession until his attention was drawn\r\nto the advertisement for the missing roger he had never even heard of\r\nthe name of tichborne and it was only his success when by way of a\r\njoke upon a chum he claimed to be the missing baronet that led him\r\nto pursue the matter in sober earnest indeed he seemed at first very\r\nreluctant to leave australia and probably he was only driven to accede\r\nto lady tichbornes request to return home at once by the fact that\r\nhe had raised large sums of money on his expectations his original\r\nintention was probably to obtain some sort of recognition and then to\r\nreturn to australia with whatever money he had succeeded in collecting\r\n\r\nafter wasting much time he left australia and arrived in england by\r\na very circuitous route on christmas day  his first step on\r\nlanding it was subsequently discovered was to make a mysterious\r\nvisit to wapping his parents were dead but his enquiries showed\r\na knowledge both of the orton family and the locality which was\r\nafterwards used against him with very damaging effect his next\r\nproceeding was to make a flying and surreptitious excursion to\r\ntichborne house where as far as possible he acquainted himself with\r\nthe bearings of the place in this he was greatly assisted by one rous\r\na former clerk to the old tichborne attorney who was then keeping a\r\npublic house in the place from this man who became his staunch ally\r\nhe had no doubt acquired much useful information and it is significant\r\nthat he sedulously kept clear of mr gosford the agent to whom the\r\nreal roger had confided his sealed packet before leaving england\r\n\r\nlady tichborne was living in paris at this time and it was here in his\r\nhotel bedroom on a dark january afternoon that their first interview\r\ntook place for curiously enough the gentleman was too ill to leave\r\nhis bed the deluded woman professed to recognise him at once as\r\nshe sat beside his bed roger keeping his face turned to the wall\r\nthe conversation took a wide range the sick man showing himself\r\nstrangely astray he talked to her of his grandfather whom the real\r\nroger had never seen he said he had served in the ranks referred to\r\nstonyhurst as winchester spoke of his suffering as a lad from st\r\nvituss dancea complaint which first led to young arthur orton being\r\nsent on a sea voyage but did not speak of the rheumatism from which\r\nroger had suffered but it was all one to the infatuated womanhe\r\nconfuses everything as if in a dream she wrote in exculpating him\r\nbut unsatisfactory as this identification was she never departed from\r\nher belief she lived under the same roof with him for weeks accepted\r\nhis wife and children and allowed him £ a year it did not weigh\r\nwith her that the rest of the family unanimously declared him to be an\r\nimpostor or that he failed to recognise them or to recall any incident\r\nin rogers life\r\n\r\nnearly four years elapsed before the claimant commenced his suit of\r\nejectment against the trustees of the infant sir alfred tichbornethe\r\nposthumous son of rogers younger brother but he utilised the time\r\nto good purpose he had taken into his service a couple of old\r\ncarbineers who had been rogers servants and before long so completely\r\nmastered small details of regimental life that some thirty of rogers\r\nold brotherofficers and men were convinced of his identity he\r\nwent everywhere called upon all rogers old friends visited the\r\ncarbineers mess and generally left no stone unturned to get together\r\nevidence in support of his identity as a result of his strenuous\r\nactivity and plausibility he produced at the first trial over one\r\nhundred witnesses who on oath identified him as roger tichborne\r\nand these witnesses included lady tichborne the family solicitor\r\nmagistrates officers and men from rogers old regiment besides various\r\ntichborne tenants and friends of the family on the other hand there\r\nwere only seventeen witnesses arraigned against him and in his own\r\nopinion it was his own evidence that lost him the case he would have\r\nwon he said if only he could have kept his mouth shut\r\n\r\nthe trial of this action lasted  days sergeant ballantine led for\r\nthe claimant and sir john coleridge afterwards lord chiefjustice\r\nand mr hawkins q c afterwards lord brampton for the trustees\r\nof the estates of tichborne the crossexamination of the claimant at\r\nthe hands of sir john coleridge lasted twentytwo days during which\r\nthe colossal ignorance he displayed was only equalled by his boldness\r\ndexterity and the bulldog tenacity with which he faced the ordeal\r\nto quote sir johns own words the first sixteen years of his life\r\nhe has absolutely forgotten the few facts he had told the jury were\r\nalready proved or would hereafter be shown to be absolutely false and\r\nfabricated of his college life he could recollect nothing about his\r\namusements his books his music his games he could tell nothing\r\nnot a word of his family of the people with whom he lived their\r\nhabits their persons their very names he had forgotten his mothers\r\nmaiden name he was ignorant of all particulars of the family estate\r\nhe remembered nothing of stonyhurst and in military matters he was\r\nequally deficient roger born and educated in france spoke and wrote\r\nfrench like a native and his favourite reading was french literature\r\nbut the claimant knew nothing of french of the sealed packet he\r\nknew nothing and when pressed his interpretation of its contents\r\ncontained the foulest and blackest calumny of the cousin whom roger had\r\nso fondly loved this was proved by mr gosford to whom the packet had\r\nbeen originally entrusted and by the production of the duplicate which\r\nroger had given to miss doughty herself the physical discrepancy too\r\nwas no less remarkable for while roger who took after his mother was\r\nslight and delicate with narrow sloping shoulders a long narrow face\r\nand thin straight dark hair the claimant was of enormous bulk scaling\r\nover twentyfour stone bigframed and burly with a large round face\r\nand an abundance of fair and rather wavy hair and yet curiously\r\nenough the claimant undoubtedly possessed a strong likeness to several\r\nmale members of the tichborne family\r\n\r\nwhen questioned as to the impressive episode of rogers love for his\r\ncousin the claimant showed himself hopelessly at sea his answers\r\nwere confused and irreconcilable not only could he give no precise\r\ndates but even the broad outline of the story was beyond him yet\r\nfor good reasons the solicitorgeneral persisted in pressing him as\r\nto the contents of the sealed packet and compelled him to repeat the\r\nslanderous version of the incident which he had long ago given when\r\ninterrogated on the point mrs radcliffe she was not then lady sat\r\nin court beside her husband and thus had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nthe infamous charges brought against the fair fame of her girlhood\r\nrecoil on the head of the wretch who had resorted to such villainous\r\ndevices unfortunately some years after rogers disappearance mr\r\ngosford feeling that he was neither justified in keeping the precious\r\npacket nor in handing it to any other person had burnt it but\r\nfortunately his testimony as to its contents was proved in the most\r\ncomplete manner by the production of the duplicate which poor roger had\r\ngiven to his cousin on his last visit to tichborne\r\n\r\nwhere the case broke down most completely was in the matter of tattoo\r\nmarks roger had been freely tattooed among other marks he bore on\r\nhis left arm a cross an anchor and a heart which was testified to\r\nby the persons who had pricked them in orton too it was found out\r\nhad also been tattooed on his left arm with his initials a o\r\nand though neither remained there was a mark which was sworn to be\r\nthe obliteration of those letters small wonder then that on the top\r\nof this damning piece of evidence the jury declared they required to\r\nhear nothing further upon which the claimants counsel to avoid the\r\ninevitable verdict for their opponents elected to be nonsuited but\r\nthese tactics did not save their client for he was at once arrested\r\non the judges warrant on the charge of wilful and corrupt perjury\r\nand committed to newgate where he remained until bail for £ was\r\nforthcoming\r\n\r\na year later on april   the claimant was arraigned before\r\na special jury in the court of queens bench the proceedings were\r\nof a most prolix and unusual character practically the same ground\r\nwas covered as in the civil trial only the process was reversed\r\nthe claimant having now to defend instead of to attack many of\r\nthe betterclass witnesses including the majority of rogers\r\nbrotherofficers now forsook the claimant there was a deal of\r\ncrossswearing the climax of the long trial was the production by the\r\ndefence of a witness to support the claimants account of his wreck\r\nand rescue this was a man who called himself jean luie and claimed\r\nto be a danish seaman with a wealth of picturesque detail he told\r\nhow he was one of the crew of the osprey which had picked up a boat\r\nof the shipwrecked bella in which was the claimant and some of the\r\ncrew and how when the osprey arrived at melbourne in the height\r\nof the gold fever every man of the crew from the captain downwards\r\nhad deserted the ship and gone up country according to his story from\r\nthat time forth he had seen nothing of any of the castaways but having\r\ncome to england in search of his wife he had heard of the trial when\r\nluie was first brought into the presence of the claimant that astute\r\nperson immediately claimed him with the greeting in spanish como\r\nesta luiehow are you luie the sailor with equal readiness\r\nrecognised orton as the man he had helped to rescue years before all\r\nthis sounded very convincing but it would not stand investigation\r\nfrom the beginning to end the thing was an invention an examination\r\nof shipping records failed to find the osprey so that she must have\r\nescaped the notice of the authorities in every port she had entered\r\nfrom the day she was launched of sailor luie however a very\r\ncomplete record was established not only were the police able to prove\r\nthat at the time he swore he was a seaman on board the osprey\r\nhe was actually employed by a firm at hull that he had never been\r\na seaman at all but that he was a wellknown habitual criminal and\r\nconvict only recently released on a ticketofleave this made things\r\nvery awkward for the defence who made every effort to shake free from\r\nthe taint of such perjured evidence dr kenealy seeing his dilemma\r\ncontended that it had been concocted by luie himself but the damning\r\nand unanswerable fact remainedthat by his recognition of the man\r\nthe claimant had acknowledged a previous acquaintance with him which he\r\ncould only have had by being privy to the fraud\r\n\r\non february   the one hundred and eightyeighth day of the\r\ntrial the jury after halfanhours deliberation returned their\r\nverdict they found that the defendant was not roger charles\r\ntichborne that he was arthur orton and finally that the charges made\r\nagainst miss catherine doughty were not supported by the slightest\r\nevidence orton was sentenced to fourteen years penal servitude which\r\nassuredly was none too heavy for offences so enormous the trial\r\nwas remarkable not only for its inordinate length but also for the\r\nextraordinary scenes by which it was characterised and for which dr\r\nkenealy leading counsel for the defence was primarily responsible\r\nhis conduct was sternly denounced by the lord chief justice in his\r\nsumming up as the torrent of undisguised and unlimited abuse in which\r\nthe learned counsel for the defence has thought fit to indulge and\r\nhe declared that there never was in the history of jurisprudence a\r\ncase in which such an amount of imputation and invective had been used\r\nbefore after the trial was over dr kenealy tried to turn the case\r\ninto a national question through the medium of a virulent paper he\r\nstarted with the title of the englishman and undeterred by being\r\ndisbarred for his flagrant breaches of professional etiquette he went\r\nabout the country delivering the most extravagant speeches concerning\r\nthe trial he was elected member of parliament for stoke and on april\r\n  moved for a royal commission of inquiry into the conduct of\r\nthe tichborne case but his motion was defeated by  votes to \r\n\r\nthe verdict and sentence created enormous excitement throughout the\r\ncountry for all classes more or less had subscribed to the defence\r\nfund but by the time orton was released in  practically\r\nall interest had died away and his effort to resuscitate it was a\r\nmiserable failure in the sworn confession which he published in the\r\npeople in  he told the whole story of the fraud from its\r\ninception to its final denouement orton survived his release from\r\nprison for fourteen years but gradually sinking into poverty he died\r\nin obscure lodgings in shouldham street marylebone on april  \r\nto the end he was a fraud and impostor for before his death he is\r\nsaid to have recanted his sworn confession which nevertheless bore the\r\nstamp of truth and was in perfect accord with the information obtained\r\nby the prosecution while his coffin bore the lying inscription sir\r\nroger charles doughty tichborne born th january  died st\r\napril \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvii women as men\r\n\r\n\r\na the motive for disguise\r\n\r\none of the commonest forms of impostureso common that it seems rooted\r\nin a phase of human natureis that of women who disguise themselves\r\nas men it is not to be wondered at that such attempts are made or\r\nthat they were made more often formerly when social advancement had not\r\nenlarged the scope of work available for women the legal and economic\r\ndisabilities of the gentler sex stood then so fixedly in the way of\r\nworking opportunity that women desirous of making an honest livelihood\r\ntook desperate chances to achieve their object we have read of very\r\nmany cases in the past and even now the humdrum of life is broken by\r\nthe fact or the echo of some startling revelation of the kind only\r\nvery lately the death of a person who had for many years occupied a\r\nworthy though humble position in london caused a postmortem sensation\r\nby the discovery that the deceased individual though looked on for\r\nabout a quarter of a century as a man a widower and the father of\r\na grownup daughter was in reality a woman she was actually buried\r\nunder the name of the man she had professed to be harry lloyd\r\n\r\nit is not to be wondered at that in more strenuous times when the\r\nspirit of adventure was less curbed and initial difficulties were\r\nless deadened by convention cases of concealment of sex were far more\r\nnumerous and more easily prolonged in an age of foreign wars many\r\nexisting barriers against success in this respect were removed by\r\ngeneral laxity of social conditions perhaps i may be allowed to say at\r\nthe outset that for my own part my mind refuses absolutely to accept\r\nthat which is generally alleged in each case that the male comrades\r\nof women concealing their proper sex were all through ignorant of\r\nthe true facts human nature is opposed to such a supposition and\r\nexperience bears out the shrewdness of nature on occasions or even\r\nfor a time it is possible to make such successful concealments but\r\nwhen we are told that a woman has gone through a whole campaign or a\r\nprolonged voyage in all the overcrowded intimacy of tent and bivouac\r\nor of cabin and forecastle without such a secret being suspected or\r\ndiscovered the narrator makes an overlarge draft on human credulity\r\nthat such comrades and many of them forbore to give away the\r\nsecret no matter how it had come into their possession we may well\r\nbelieve comradeship is a strong factor in such matters and it has\r\nits own loyalty which is never stronger than when the various persons\r\ninterested are held together by the knowledge of a common danger\r\nbut even to this there is a contra the whole spirit of romance even\r\nwhen it binds man to woman and woman to man stands side by side with\r\nlove affection passioncall it what you willwhich opportunity can\r\nfan into flame never more so than in the strenuous days of fighting\r\nwhen day and night are full of varying fearswhen the mad turmoil of\r\nworking hours and loneliness of the night forge new fetters for the\r\nbinding together of the sexes\r\n\r\nin real life when a man or a woman tries to escape from capture or\r\nthe fear of it in the guise of the opposite sex it is a neverending\r\nstruggle to sustain the rôle successfully if this is so when the\r\nwhole of the energies of mind and body are devoted in singleness\r\nof purpose to the task how then can the imposture be successfully\r\nprolonged when the mind is eternally occupied with the pressing\r\nthings of the passing moments there must infallibly be moments of\r\nselfbetrayal and there is sufficient curiosity in the average person\r\nto insure that the opportunities of such moments are not lost be this\r\nas it may we must in the first instance stick to matters of fact the\r\nrecord is our sheetanchor after all when we learn of a case where\r\nan imposture of the kind has been successfully carried out it is time\r\nenough to argue with convincing perspicacity that it should not have\r\nbeen possible\r\n\r\nas to record there are quite sufficient cases to convince any reader\r\nas to the fact that allowing for all possible error and wastage\r\nthere have been a sufficient number undetected at the time of their\r\nhappening and only made known by afterconfession and by the force of\r\nulterior circumstances whatever opinion we may form of the women who\r\ncarried out the venture there is neither occasion nor need to doubt\r\nthe fact they were so carried out the consideration of a few cases\r\nculled from the records of this class of successful imposture will\r\nmake this plain it would be useless if not impossible to make full\r\nlists of the names of women who have passed themselves off as men in\r\nthe fighting worldsoldiers and sailors with side interests such as\r\npiracy duelling highway robbery etc amongst the female soldiers\r\nare the names of christian davis known as mother ross hannah snell\r\nphœbe hessel amongst the sailors those of mary talbot ann mills\r\nhannah whitney charles waddell in the ranks of the pirates are mary\r\nreid and ann bonney in many of these cases are underlying romances as\r\nof women making search for lost or absconding husbands or of lovers\r\nmaking endeavours to regain the lost paradise of life together\r\n\r\nif there were nothing else in these little histories their perusal in\r\ndetail would well repay attention as affording proof of the boundless\r\ndevotion of womans love no matter how badly the man may have treated\r\nthe woman no matter how heartlessly or badly he may have behaved\r\ntowards her her affection was proof against all indeed it makes\r\none believe that there is some subtle selfsustaining selfennobling\r\nquality in womanhood which her initial selfsurrender makes a constant\r\nforce towards good even a nature which took new strength from the\r\nturmoil of battle from the harrowing suspense of perpetual vigil from\r\nthe strain of physical weakness bravely borne from pain and want and\r\nhunger instead of hardening into obstinate indifference seems to have\r\nsoftened as to sentiment and been made gentle as to memory as though\r\nthe sense of wrong had been purged by the forces of affliction all\r\nthis though the stress of campaigning may have blunted some of the\r\nconventional susceptibility of womanhood for the after life of some of\r\nthese warlike heroines showed that they had lost none of the love of\r\nadmiration which marks their sex none of their satisfaction in posing\r\nas characters other than their own several of them found pleasure in a\r\nnew excitement different from that of battle in the art of the stage\r\nwhenever any of them made any effort to settle down in life after their\r\nexcitement in the life of

instance of how the life of a woman who was not\r\nby nature averse from adventure was moulded by chance in the direction\r\nwhich suited her individuality of course liking for a militant life\r\nwhether in conventional or exceptional form presupposes a natural\r\nboldness of spirit resolution and physical hardihoodall of which\r\nthis woman possessed in an eminent degree\r\n\r\nshe was born at worcester in  one of the family of a hosier who\r\nhad three sons and six daughters in  when her father and mother\r\nwere dead she went to live at wapping with a sister who had married

barbarous system of the time she was\r\nsentenced to  lashes of these she had actually received  when\r\non the intervention of some of the officers the remaining hundred\r\nwere foregone after this fearing further aggression on the part of\r\nthe revengeful petty officer she deserted she walked all the way to\r\nportsmoutha journey which occupied a whole monthwhere she again\r\nenlisted as a

on the coromandel\r\ncoast in which action hannah fought so bravely that she was praised\r\nby her officers later on she assisted in the siege of pondicherry\r\nwhich lasted nearly three months before

left leg and one in the abdomen her\r\nfear was not of death but discovery of her sex through the lastnamed\r\nwound by the friendly aid of a black woman however she avoided this\r\ndanger she managed to extract the bullet herself with her finger and\r\nthumb and the wound made a good cure this wound caused her a delay\r\nof some weeks during which her ship had to leave for bombay and was\r\ndelayed five weeks by a leak poor hannah was again unfortunate in her\r\nofficers one of them to whom she had refused to sing had her put in\r\nirons and given a dozen lashes in  she went to

of the readers of the englishspeaking race who enjoy\r\nthéophile gautiers fascinating romance mademoiselle de maupin are\r\nnot aware that the heroine was a real person the novelist has of\r\ncourse made such alterations as are required to translate crude fact\r\ninto more elegant fiction and to obliterate so far as can be done the\r\ncriminal or partlycriminal aspect of the ladys venturous career but\r\nsuch is one of the chief duties of an artist in fiction though he\r\nmay be an historian in a sense he is not limited to the occasional\r\nbareness of truth his object is not that his work shall be true but\r\nrather what the french call vraisemblable in narrative as in most\r\narts crudeness is rather a fault than a virtue so that the writer\r\nwho looks for excellence in his work has without losing force to fill\r\nup the blanks left by the necessary excision of fact by subtleties of\r\nthought and graces of description so that the fulness or rotundity\r\nof the natural curves shall always be maintained in truth the story\r\nof la maupin is so laden with passages of excitement and interest\r\nthat any writer on the subject has only to make an agreeable choice\r\nof episodes sufficiently dramatic and consistent with each other\r\nto form a cohesive narrative such a work has in it possibilities of\r\ngreat successif only the author has the genius of a théophile gautier\r\nto set it forth the real difficulty which such an one would have\r\nto contend against would be to remove the sordidness the reckless\r\npassion the unscrupulousness the criminal intent which lies behind\r\nsuch a character\r\n\r\nthe mademoiselle de maupin of real life was a singer at the opera in\r\nparis at the end of the seventeenth century she was the daughter\r\nof a man of somewhat humble extraction engaged in secretarial work\r\nwith the count darmagnac and whilst only a girl married a man named\r\nmaupin employed in the province with him she had lived only a few\r\nmonths when she ran away with a maitre darmes anglicè a fencing\r\nmaster named serane if this individual had no other good quality in\r\nmatters human or divine he was at least a good teacher of the sword\r\nhis professional arts were used in the service of his inamorata who\r\nbecame herself an excellent swordsman even in an age when swordsmanship\r\nhad an important place in social life it may have been the sexual\r\nequality implied by the name which gave the young woman the idea but\r\nthenceforth she became a man in appearancein reality in so far as\r\nsuch a metamorphosis can be accomplished by courage recklessness\r\nhardihood unscrupulousness and a willing obedience to all the ideas\r\nwhich passion and sensuality can originate and a greed of notoriety\r\ncarry into execution\r\n\r\nin a professional tour from paris to marseilles in which she as an\r\nactress took the part of a man she gained the affections of the\r\nflighty daughter of a rich merchant of marseilles and as a man ran\r\naway with her being pursued they sought refuge in a conventa place\r\nwhich at that age it was manifestly easier to get into than to get\r\nout of here the two remained for a few days during which by the\r\naid of histrionic and other arts the actress obviated the necessary\r\nsuspicions of her foolish companion and kept danger away all the while\r\nla maupin was conscious that an irate and rich father was in hot search\r\nfor his missing daughter and she knew that any talk about the venture\r\nwould infallibly lose her the girls fortune besides getting herself\r\nwithin the grip of the law so she decided on a bold scheme of escape\r\nfrom the convent whereby she might obliterate her tracks a nun of\r\nthe convent had died and her body was awaiting burial in the night la\r\nmaupin exchanged the body of the dead nun for the living one of her own\r\nvictim having thus got her companion out of the convent she set the\r\nbuilding on fire to cover up everything and escaped in secret to a\r\nneighbouring village taking with her by force the girl who naturally\r\nenough was disillusioned and began to have scruples as to the wisdom\r\nof her conduct in the village they remained hidden for a few weeks\r\nduring which time the repentance of the poor girl became a fixed\r\nquantity an attempt well supported was made to arrest the ostensible\r\nman but this was foiled by the female swordsman who killed one of the\r\nwouldbe captors and dangerously wounded two others the girl however\r\nmade good her escape secretly she fled from her deceiver and reached\r\nher parents in safety but the hue and cry was out after la maupin\r\nwhose identity was now known she was pursued captured and placed\r\nin gaol to await trial the law was strong and inexorable the erring\r\nwoman who had thus outraged so many conventions was condemned to be\r\nburned alive\r\n\r\nbut abstract law and the executive are quite different thingsat least\r\nthey were in france at the close of the seventeenth century as indeed\r\nthey are occasionally in other countries and at varying times la\r\nmaupin being a woman and a clever one procured sufficient influence\r\nto have the execution postponed and so had the full punishment\r\ndelayed if not entirely avoided more than this she managed to get\r\nback to paris and so to begin her noxious career all over again of\r\ncourse she had strong help from her popularity she was a favourite at\r\nthe opera and the class which patronises and supports this kind of\r\nartistic effort is a rich and powerful one which governments do not\r\ncare to displease by the refusal of such a small favour as making the\r\nlaw hold its hand with regard to an erring favourite\r\n\r\nbut la maupins truculent tendencies were not to be restrained in\r\nparis in  whilst she was one of the audience at a theatre she took\r\numbrage at some act or speech of one of the comedians playing in the\r\npiece and leaving her seat went round to the stage and caned him in\r\nthe presence of the audience the actor m dumenil an accomplished\r\nand favourite performer but a man of peaceful disposition submitted\r\nto the affront and took no action in the matter la maupin however\r\nsuffered through herself the penalty of her conduct she had\r\nentered on a course of violence which became a habit for some years\r\nshe flourished and exercised all the tyrannies of her own sex and\r\nin addition those habitual to men which came from expert use of the\r\nsword thus she went attired as a man to a ball given by a prince of\r\nthe blood in that garb she treated a fellowguest a woman with\r\nindecency and she was challenged by three different meneach of\r\nwhom when the consequent fight came on she ran through the body\r\nafter which she returned to the ball shortly afterwards she fought\r\nand wounded a man m de servan who had affronted a woman for these\r\nescapades she was again pardoned she then went to brussels where she\r\nlived under the protection of count albert of bavaria the elector\r\nwith him she remained until the quarrel inevitable in such a life\r\ncame after much bickering he agreed to her demand of a settlement\r\nbut in order to show his anger by affronting her he sent the large\r\namount of his involuntary bequest by the servile hand of the husband\r\nof his mistress countess darcos who had supplanted her with a\r\ncurt message that she must leave brussels at once the bearer of such\r\na message to such a woman as la maupin had probably reckoned on an\r\nunfriendly reception but he evidently underestimated her anger not\r\ncontented with flinging at his head the large douceur of which he was\r\nthe bearer she expressed in her direct way her unfavourable opinion\r\nof him of his master and of the message which he had carried for\r\nthe latter she ended her tirade by kicking him downstairs with the\r\njustification for her form of physical violence that she would not\r\nsully her sword with his blood\r\n\r\nfrom brussels she went to spain as femme de chambre to the countess\r\nmarino but returned to paris in  once more she took up her work as\r\nan opera singer or rather she tried to take it up but she had lost\r\nher vogue and the public would have none of her as a matter of fact\r\nshe was only just above thirty years of age which should under normal\r\ncircumstances be the beginning of a womans prime but the life she\r\nhad been leading since her early girlhood was not one which made for\r\ntrue happiness or for physical health she was prematurely old and her\r\nartistic powers were worn out\r\n\r\nstill her pluck and the obstinacy on which it was grafted remained\r\nfor a whole year she maintained a neverfailing struggle for her old\r\nsupremacy but without avail seeing that all was lost she left the\r\nstage and returned to her husband who realising that she was rich\r\nmanaged to reconcile whatever shreds of honour he had to her infamous\r\nrecord the church too accepted herand her richeswithin its\r\nsheltering portals by the aid of a tolerant priest she got absolution\r\nand two years after her retirement from the opera she died in a convent\r\nin all the odour of sanctity\r\n\r\n\r\nd mary east\r\n\r\nthe story of mary east is a pitiful one and gives a picture of\r\nthe civil life of the eighteenth century which cannot be lightly\r\nforgotten the condition of things has so changed that already we\r\nalmost need a new terminology in order that we may understand as our\r\ngreatgrandfathers did take for instance the following sentence and\r\ntry individually how many points in it there are the full meaning of\r\nwhich we are unable to understand\r\n\r\na young fellow courted one mary east and for him she conceived the\r\ngreatest liking but he going upon the highway was tried for a robbery\r\nand cast but was afterwards transported\r\n\r\nthe above was written by an accomplished scholar a doctor of divinity\r\nrector of an english parish at the time of its writing  every\r\nword of it was entirely comprehensible if a reader of that time could\r\nsee it translated into modern phraseology he would be almost as much\r\nsurprised as we are when we look back upon an age holding possibilities\r\nno longer imaginable\r\n\r\ngoing upon the highway was in mary easts time and a hundred years\r\nlater a euphemism for becoming a highway robber cast meant condemned\r\nto death transported meant exiled to a far distant place where one\r\nwas guarded and escape from which was punishable with death moreover\r\nrobbery was at this time a capital offence\r\n\r\nin  when mary east was sixteen life was especially hard on women\r\nfew honest occupations were open to them and they were subject to all\r\nthe hardships consequent on a system in which physical weakness was\r\nhandicapped to a frightful extent when this poor girl was bereft of\r\nher natural hope of a settlement in life she determined as the least\r\nunattractive form of living open to her to remain single about the\r\nsame time a friend of hers arrived at the same resolution but by a\r\ndifferent road her course being guided thereto by having met with\r\nmany crosses in love the two girls determined to join forces and\r\non consulting as to ways and means decided that the likeliest way to\r\navoid suspicion was to live together under the guise of man and wife\r\nthe toss of a coin decided their respective rôles the breeches part\r\nas it is called in the argot of the theatre falling to east the\r\ncombined resources of the girls totalled some thirty pounds sterling\r\nso after buying masculine garb for mary they set out to find a place\r\nwhere they were unknown and so might settle down in peace they found\r\nthe sort of place they sought in the neighbourhood of epping forest\r\nwhere there being a little publichouse vacant marynow under the\r\nname of james howbecame the tenant for some time they lived in peace\r\nat epping with the exception of a quarrel forced by a young gentleman\r\non the alleged james how in which the latter was wounded in the hand\r\nit must have been a very onesided affair for when the injured man\r\ntook action he was awarded £ damagesa large sum in those days\r\nand for such a cause with this increase to their capital the two\r\nwomen moved to limehouse on the east side of london where they took at\r\nlimehousehole a more important publichouse this they managed in so\r\nexcellent a manner that they won the respect of their neighbours and\r\nthrove exceedingly\r\n\r\nafter a time they moved from limehouse to poplar where they bought\r\nanother house and added to their little estate by the purchase of other\r\nhouses\r\n\r\npeace hard work and prosperity marked their life thenceforward till\r\nfourteen years had passed since the beginning of their joint venture\r\n\r\npeace and prosperity are however but feeble guardians to weakness\r\nnay rather are they incentive to evil doing for all these years\r\nthe two young women had conducted themselves with such rectitude\r\nand observed so much discretion that even envy could not assail\r\nthem through the web of good repute which they had woven round their\r\nmasquerade alone they lived keeping neither female servant nor male\r\nassistant they were scrupulously honest in their many commercial\r\ndealings and absolutely punctual in their agreements and obligations\r\njames how took a part in the public life of his locality filling in\r\nturn every parish office except those of constable and churchwarden\r\nfrom the former he was excused on account of the injury to his hand\r\nfrom which he had never completely recovered regarding the other his\r\ntime had not yet come but he was named for churchwarden in the year\r\nfollowing to that in which a bolt fell from the blue  it came\r\nin this wise a woman whose name of coverture was bently and who was\r\nnow resident in poplar had known the alleged james how in the days\r\nwhen they were both young her own present circumstances were poor\r\nand she looked on the prosperity of her old acquaintance as a means\r\nto her own betterment it was but another instance of the old crime\r\nof blackmail she sent to the former mary east for a loan of £\r\nintimating that if the latter did not send it she would make known the\r\nsecret of her sex the poor panicstricken woman foolishly complied\r\nwith the demand thus forcing herself deeper into the mire of the other\r\nwomans unscrupulousness the forced loan together with bentlys\r\nfears for her own misdeed procured immunity for some fifteen years from\r\nfurther aggression at the end of that time however under the renewed\r\npressure of need bently repeated her demand james how had not the\r\nsum by her but she sent £another link in the chain of her thraldom\r\n\r\nfrom that time on there was no more peace for poor mary east her\r\ncompanion of nearly thirtyfive years died and she having a secret\r\nto guard and no assistance being possible was more helpless than\r\never and more than ever under the merciless yoke of the blackmailer\r\nmrs bently had a fair idea of how to play her own despicable game\r\nas her victims fear was her own stockintrade she supplemented the\r\nsense of fear which she knew to exist by a conspiracy strengthened by\r\nall sorts of schemes to support its seeming bona fides she took\r\nin two male accomplices and thus enforced began operations her\r\nconfederates called on james how one armed with a constables staff\r\nthe other appearing as one of the thieftakers of the gang of the\r\nnotorious magistrate fieldingan evil product of an evil time having\r\nconfronted how they told him that they had come by order of mr justice\r\nfielding to arrest him for the commission of a robbery over forty years\r\nbefore alleging that they were aware of his being a woman mary east\r\nthough quite innocent of any such offence but acutely conscious of her\r\nimposture of manhood in her dismay sought the aid of a friend called\r\nwilliams who understood and helped her he went to the magistrates\r\nof the district and then to sir john fielding to make inquiries and\r\nclaim protection during his absence the two villains took mary east\r\nfrom her house and by threats secured from her a draft on williams\r\nfor £ with this in hand they released their victim who was even\r\nmore anxious than themselves not to let the matter have greater\r\npublicity than it had already obtained however justice demanded a\r\nfurther investigation and one of the men being capturedthe other\r\nhad escapedwas tried and being found guilty was sentenced to\r\nimprisonment for four years together with four appearances in the\r\npillory\r\n\r\naltogether mary east and her companion had lived together as husband\r\nand wife for nearly thirtyfive years during which time they had\r\nhonestly earned and by selfdenial saved over four thousand pounds\r\nsterling and won the good opinion of all with whom they had come in\r\ncontact they were never known to cook a joint of meat for their own\r\nuse to employ any help or to entertain private friends in their\r\nhouse they were cautious careful and discreet in every way and\r\nseemed to live their lives in exceeding blamelessness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviii hoaxes etc\r\n\r\n\r\nthere is a class of imposture which must be kept apart from others\r\nof its kind or at least earmarked in such wise that there can be\r\nno confusion of ideas regarding it this includes all sorts of acts\r\nwhich though often attended with something of the same result as other\r\nefforts to mislead are yet distinguished from them by intention they\r\nhavewhatever may be their resultsa jocular and humorous intention\r\nsuch performances are called hoaxes these though amusing to their\r\nperpetrators and to certain sportive persons and though generally\r\ncausing a due amount of pain and loss to those on whom they are\r\ninflicted usually escape the condign and swift punishment which they\r\ndeserve it is generally held that humour like charity covereth a\r\nmultitude of sins so be it we are all grateful for a laugh no matter\r\nwho may suffer\r\n\r\n\r\na two london hoaxes\r\n\r\nnot many years ago in one of the popular dairyrefreshment shops in\r\nholborn the prim manageress and her whitecapped waitresses were just\r\ncommencing their days work when a couple of sturdy greenaproned men\r\nswooped down on the place from a large pantechnicon van and to the\r\namazement of the young ladies commenced to clear the shop\r\n\r\nthere you are bill hand up them chairs and look slippy\r\n\r\nright o mate\r\n\r\ngood gracious me what are you men doing shrieked the alarmed\r\nmanageress\r\n\r\ndoing miss doing why moving the furniture this is the lot aint\r\nit\r\n\r\nno no no there must be some mistake you must have come to the\r\nwrong place\r\n\r\nmistake wrong place no miss ere look wheres that letter and\r\njack placed a begrimed document before the lady\r\n\r\nthe letter seemed right enough it read beautifully a plain direction\r\nto clear the shop and remove the stuff elsewhere it only lacked the\r\nofficial heading of the company but the joint inspection was rudely\r\nbroken in upon by the arrival of a couple of the knights of the brush\r\nwho had come to do the chimbley maam and ere they could be disposed\r\nof vans of coals began to draw up more pantechnicons more sweeps\r\nloads of furniture butchers with prime joints plump birds from the\r\npoulterers fish of every conceivable kind noisy greengrocer boys\r\nstaggering under huge loads of vegetables florists to decorate\r\ngasfitters carpenters to take down the counter miss others to put\r\nit up\r\n\r\n                                   \r\n\r\npandemonium is quiet compared with that shop the poor manageress was\r\nin tears deafened with the exasperated swearing representatives\r\nof apparently all the tradesmen for miles around the thing had\r\nbeen well done no sooner had the provision merchants worked clear\r\nand the streams of vans waggons and carts been backed away to the\r\naccompaniment of much lurid language than ladies began to arrive with\r\nboxes of mysterious long garments which they assured the indignant\r\nlady in charge they were instructed were urgently needed for an event\r\nthey referred to as interesting there was no monotony for fast and\r\nfuriousvery furious sometimescame other maidens laden with more\r\nboxes and still more boxes filled with costumes bonnets and other\r\ncreations dear to the feminine mind then came servants in answer to\r\nyour advertisement madam they flocked in from all directions north\r\nsouth east and west never was seen such a concourse of servants\r\ndignified housekeepers housemaids parlourmaids and every other\r\nsort of maid seemed to be making for that unfortunate manageress\r\nsleeklooking butlers popped in as uniformed nurses popped out\r\nwindowcleaners had to be

benefit\r\npresumably were intended beautiful wreaths crosses harps etc which\r\nkept constantly arriving throughout that livelong day to the dewy\r\neve beloved of the poet the game went merrily on\r\n\r\nas a hoax the thing was worked for all it was worth not only had\r\nshoals of letters evidently been sent out but advertisements too had\r\nbeen freely distributed among the press needless to say that despite\r\nthe closest investigations its author or authors discreetly silent\r\nremained unknown\r\n\r\nthe joke was not new by any means well nigh a century before\r\nmischiefloving theodore hook had stirred all london by a similar\r\nprankthe famous berners street hoax in those days berners street was\r\na quiet thoroughfare inhabited by fairly welltodo families indeed\r\nit was this very sedate quietness which drew upon it hooks unwelcome\r\nattention fixing on one of the houses which happened to be adorned\r\nwith a brass plate he made a wager with a brother wag that he would\r\ncause that particular house to become the talk of the town and he\r\ncertainly didfor not only the town but all england shrieked with\r\nlaughter when the result of his little manœuvre became known\r\n\r\none morning soon after breakfast waggons laden with coals began\r\nto draw up before the house with the brass plate no  these\r\nwere quickly succeeded with tradespeople by the dozen with various\r\ncommodities these in turn were followed by van loads of furniture\r\nfollowed by a hearse with a coffin and a number of mourning coaches\r\nsoon the street became choked for what with the goods dumped down\r\nas near as possible to the housepianos organs and cart loads of\r\nfurniture of all descriptions the anxious tradesmen and the laughing\r\nmob of people quickly attracted to the scene confusion reigned\r\nsupreme about this time the lord mayor and other notabilities began\r\nto arrive in their carriages his lordships stay was short he was\r\ndriven to marlborough street police office where he informed the\r\nmagistrate that he had received a note purporting to come from mrs\r\nt the victimised widow resident at no  saying she was confined\r\nto her room and begging his lordship to do her the favour of calling\r\non her on important business meanwhile the trouble in berners\r\nstreet was growing serious and officers belonging to the marlborough\r\nstreet office were at once sent to keep order for a time even they\r\nwere helpless never was such a strange meeting barbers with wigs\r\nmantlemakers with bandboxes opticians with their various articles of\r\ntrade presently there arrived a couple of fashionable physicians an\r\naccoucheur and a dentist there were clockmakers carpet manufacturers\r\nand wine merchants all loaded with specimens of their trade brewers\r\nwith barrels of ale curiosity dealers with sundry knickknacks\r\ncartloads of potatoes books prints jewellery feathers and furbelows\r\nof all kinds ices and jellies conjuring tricks never was such a\r\nconglomeration then about five oclock servants of all kinds began\r\nto troop in to apply for situations for a time the police officers\r\nwere powerless vehicles were jammed and interlocked the exasperated\r\ndrivers were swearing and the disappointed tradesmen were maddened\r\nby the malicious fun of the crowd who were enjoying the joke some\r\nof the vans were overturned and many of the tradesmens goods came\r\nto grief while some of the casks of ale became the prey of the\r\ndelighted spectators all through the day and late into the night this\r\nextraordinary state of things continued to the dismay and terror of\r\nthe poor lady and the other inmates of the house with the brass plate\r\n\r\ntheodore hook had taken precautions to secure a good seat for the\r\nperformance having taken furnishedapartments just opposite the house\r\nof his victim where he posted himself with one or two companions to\r\nenjoy the scene hooks connection with the mad joke was fortunately\r\nfor him not known until long afterwards it seems he had devoted three\r\nor four whole days to writing the letters all couched in ladylike\r\nstyle in the end the novelist seems to have been rather frightened at\r\nthe result of his little joke for he made a speedy departure to the\r\ncountry and there is no doubt that had he been publicly known as its\r\nauthor he would have fared badly\r\n\r\n\r\nb the cat hoax\r\n\r\none very amusing variation of the countless imitations which the\r\nsuccess of this trick gave rise to was the cat hoax at chester\r\nin august  it was at the time when it had been determined to\r\nsend napoleon to st helena one morning a number of hand bills were\r\ndistributed in and around chester stating that owing to the island of\r\nst helena being invested with rats the government required a number\r\nof cats for deportation sixteen shillings were offered for every\r\nathletic fullgrown tom cat ten shillings for every adult female\r\npuss and a halfcrown for every thriving kitten that could swill\r\nmilk pursue a ball of thread or fasten its young fangs in a dying\r\nmouse an address was given at which the cats were to be delivered\r\nbut it proved to be an empty house the advertisement resulted in the\r\nvictimisation of hundreds of people men women and children streamed\r\ninto the city from miles around laden with cats of every description\r\nsome hundreds were brought in and the scene before the door of the\r\nempty house is said to have baffled description when the hoax was\r\ndiscovered

nature have more than once led to serious\r\nresults in the summer of  a report was extensively circulated that\r\na grand military review was to be held on the th of june booths were\r\nerected and as many as twenty thousand people assembled despite the\r\nefforts of the authorities who when they learned what was happening\r\nposted men in the several roads leading to the heath to warn the people\r\nthat they had been hoaxed but their efforts were useless the rumour\r\nwas believed and the contradiction ignored vehicles horsemen and\r\npedestrians pushed on to their destination when however the day wore\r\non without any appearance of the promised military pageant the crowd\r\ngrew angry and then broke out in acts of violence the heath was set on\r\nfire messengers were sent off express to london and a detachment of\r\nthe guards had to be marched down to quell the mob in the disorder one\r\npoor woman was thrown out of a chaise and picked up in an unconscious\r\ncondition\r\n\r\n\r\nd the tollgate\r\n\r\nmany distinguished actors have been very fond of playing practical\r\njokes and perpetrating hoaxes young the tragedian was one day\r\ndriving in a gig with a friend on the outskirts of london pulling\r\nup at a turnpike gate he noticed the name of the tollcollector\r\nwritten up over the door calling to him the woman the wife of that\r\nfunctionary who appeared to be in charge of the gate he politely\r\ntold her that he particularly wished to see mr  naming the\r\ntollcollector on a matter of importance impressed by youngs manner\r\nshe promptly sent for her husband who was working in a neighbouring\r\nfield hastily washing himself and putting on a clean coat he presented\r\nhimself the actor gravely said i paid for a ticket at the last gate\r\nand was told that it would free me through this one as i wish to be\r\nscrupulously exact will you kindly tell me whether such is the case\r\nwhy of course it is can i then pass through without paying the\r\ntollcollectors reply and his vituperation as the travellers passed on\r\nhad better perhaps be left to the imagination\r\n\r\n\r\ne the marriage hoax\r\n\r\nhoaxes are sometimes malicious and often cruel as the following\r\ninstance will show a young couple were about to be married in\r\nbirmingham when those officiatingit was a jewish weddingwere\r\nstartled by the delivery of a telegram from london with the message\r\nstop marriage at once his wife and children have arrived in london\r\nand will come on to birmingham the bride fainted and the bridegroom\r\nwas frantically perturbed at thus summarily being provided with a\r\nwife and family but it was useless the unhappy man had to make the\r\nbest of his way through an exasperated crowd full of sympathy for the\r\nwronged girl inquiry however showed her friends that the whole thing\r\nwas a hoaxpossibly worked by some revengeful rival of the man whose\r\nhappiness had been so unexpectedly deferred\r\n\r\n\r\nf buried treasure\r\n\r\nmost people have heard of the spanish treasure swindle and though\r\nless elaborate than the original a variation of it practised on a\r\nfrench merchant was rather cute one morning he received an anonymous\r\ncommunication advising him that a box of treasure was buried in his\r\ngarden the exact position of which would be pointed out to him if\r\nhe agreed to divide the spoil he rose at once to the bait met his\r\ngenerous informant and before long the pair were merrily at work\r\nwith pickaxe and shovel sure enough before long their exertions\r\nwere awarded by the unearthing of a box full of silver coins the\r\nhoard proved to consist of sixteen hundred fivefranc pieces and\r\nthe delighted merchant after carefully counting them out into two\r\npiles offered one lot to his partner as his share that worthy after\r\ncontemplating the heap for a minute or two observed that it would\r\nbe rather a heavy load to carry to the railway station and said he\r\nwould prefer if it could be managed to have the amount in gold or\r\nnotes certainly certainly was the reply the two men walked up to\r\nthe house and the business was settled to their mutual satisfaction\r\ntwentyfour hours later the merchant took a very different view of\r\nthe transaction for examination discovered there was not one genuine\r\nfivefranc piece among the whole lot\r\n\r\n\r\ng dean swifts hoax\r\n\r\none of the most beautiful hoaxes ever perpetrated was one for which\r\nswift was responsible he caused a broadsheet to be printed and\r\ncirculated which purported to be the last dying speech of one\r\nelliston a street robber in which the condemned thief was made to\r\nsay now as i am a dying man i have done something which may be of\r\nuse to the public i have left with an honest manthe only honest man\r\ni was ever acquainted withthe names of all my wicked brethren the\r\nplaces of their abode with a short account of the chief crimes they\r\nhave committed in many of which i have been their accomplice and\r\nheard the rest from their own mouths i have likewise set down names of\r\nthose we call our setters of the wicked houses we frequent and all\r\nof those who receive and buy our stolen goods i have solemnly charged\r\nthis honest man and have received his promise upon oath that whenever\r\nhe hears of any rogue to be tried for robbery or housebreaking he\r\nwill look into his list and if he finds the name there of the thief\r\nconcerned to send the whole paper to the government of this i here\r\ngive my companions fair and public warning and hope they will take\r\nit so successful we are told was the deans ruse that for many\r\nyears afterwards street robberies were almost unknown\r\n\r\n\r\nh hoaxed burglars\r\n\r\nthe above ingenious device recalls another occasion when some gentlemen\r\nwho made burglary their profession and who had been paying a midnight\r\nvisit to the house of a hull tradesman were sadly sold they found\r\nthe cashbox lying handy and to their delight weighty so heavy\r\nindeed that they did not stay to help themselves to anything further\r\nnext morning the cashbox was found not far from the shop and its\r\ncontents in an ashpit close by after all the trouble they had taken\r\nto say nothing of the risks they had run the burglars found their\r\nprize consisted only of a lump of lead and that their intended victim\r\nhad been too artful for them\r\n\r\n\r\ni bogus sausages\r\n\r\nas an example of how a dishonest penny may be turned the following\r\nincident would be hard to beat\r\n\r\ntwo weary porters at the kings cross terminus of the great northern\r\nrailway were thinking about going home when a breathless\r\nsimplelooking countryman rushed up to them with anxious enquiries for\r\na certain train it had gone he was crushed whatever was he to do\r\nhe had been sent up from cambridge with a big hamper of those sausages\r\nfor which the university town is celebrateda very special order was\r\nthere no other train no the poor fellow seemed overwhelmed as\r\nit is too late to find another market he complained the whole lot\r\nwill be lost then a happy thought seemed to strike him as more of\r\nthe railway men gathered round and he inquired ingratiatingly would\r\nyou care to buy the sausages if you would you could have them for\r\nfourpence a pound if i keep them they will probably go bad before\r\ni can dispose of them the idea tookreal cambridge sausages at\r\nfourpence a pound was not to be sneezed at the dainties neatly packed\r\nin pounds went like the proverbial hot cakes shouldering the empty\r\nbasket and bidding his customers a kindly goodnight the yokel set\r\noff to find a humble lodging for the night grateful smiles greeted\r\nthe purchasers when they got home frying pans were got out and the\r\nsausages were popped in and never was such a sizzling heard in the\r\nrailway housesor rather never should such a sizzling have been heard\r\nbut somehow they didnt sizzle they are uncommon dry seem to have\r\nno fat in em said the puzzled cook they were dry very dry for\r\ncloser investigation showed that the prime cambridge were nothing\r\nbut skins stuffed with dry bread the railway staff of kings cross\r\nwere long anxious to meet that simple countryman from cambridge\r\n\r\n\r\nj the moon hoax\r\n\r\none of the most stupendous hoaxes and one foisted on the credulity of\r\nthe public with the most complete success was the famous moon hoax\r\nwhich was published in the pages of the new york sun in  it\r\npurported to be an account of the great astronomical discoveries of\r\nsir john herschel at the cape of good hope through the medium of a\r\nmighty telescope a single lens of which weighed nearly seven tons\r\nit was stated to be reproduced from the supplement to the edinburgh\r\njournal of science though as a matter of fact the journal had\r\nthen been defunct some years in graphic language and with a wealth\r\nof picturesque detail the wonders of the moon as revealed to the\r\ngreat astronomer and his assistants were set forth a great inland\r\nsea was observed and fairer shores never angel coasted on a tour\r\nof pleasure the beach was of brilliant white sand girt with wild\r\ncastellated rocks apparently of green marble varied at chasms\r\noccurring every two hundred feet with grotesque blocks of chalk or\r\ngypsum and feathered and festooned at the summit with the clustering\r\nfoliage of unknown trees there were hills of amethysts of a diluted\r\nclaret colour mountains fringed with virgin gold herds of brown\r\nquadrupeds resembling diminutive bison fitted with a sort of hairy\r\nveil to protect their eyes from the extremes of light and darkness\r\nstrange monstersa combination of unicorn and goat pelicans cranes\r\nstrange amphibious creatures and a remarkable biped beaver the last\r\nwas said to resemble the beaver of the earth excepting that it had\r\nno tail and walked only upon its two feet it carried its young in\r\nits arms like a humanbeing and its huts were constructed better and\r\nhigher than those of many savage tribes and from the smoke there was\r\nno doubt it was acquainted with the use of fire another remarkable\r\nanimal observed was described as having an amazingly long neck a head\r\nlike a sheep bearing two spiral horns a body like a deer but with\r\nits forelegs disproportionately long as also its tail which was very\r\nbushy and of a snowy whiteness curling high over its rump and hanging\r\ntwo or three feet by its side\r\n\r\nbut even these marvels fade into insignificance compared with the\r\ndiscovery of the lunarian men four feet in height covered except\r\non the face with short and glossy coppercoloured hair with wings\r\ncomposed of a thin membrane in general symmetry they were infinitely\r\nsuperior to the orangoutangwhich statement could hardly have\r\nbeen regarded as complimentary and though described as doubtless\r\ninnocent and happy creatures the praise was rather discounted by\r\nthe mention that some of their amusements would but ill comport with\r\nour terrestrial notions of decorum in the vale of the triads\r\nwith beautiful temples built of polished sapphire a superior race of\r\nthe punariant were found eminently happy and even polite eating\r\ngourds and red cucumbers and further afield yet another race of the\r\nvespertiliohomo or manbat were seen through the wonderful telescope\r\nof infinitely greater personal beauty  scarcely less lovely than\r\nthe general representation of angels\r\n\r\nsuch were a few of the marvels told of in the moon story and though\r\none may laugh at them as they stand shorn of their clever verbiage and\r\nquasiscientific detail at the time of publication they were seriously\r\naccepted for the popular mind even among the educated classes was\r\nthen imbued with the fanciful anticipators of vast lunar discoveries\r\nheralded in the astronomical writings of thomas dick lld of the\r\nunion college of new york scarcely anything could have been brought\r\nforward too extravagant for the general credulity on the subject then\r\nprevailing and this welltimed satire outheroding herod in its\r\nimaginative creations supplied to satiety the morbid appetite for\r\nscientific wonders then raging by its plausible display of scientific\r\nerudition it successfully duped with few exceptions the whole\r\ncivilised world\r\n\r\nat the time the hoax was very generally attributed to a french\r\nastronomer m nicollet a legitimist who fled to america in  he\r\nwas said to have written it with the twofold object of raising the\r\nwind and of taking in arago a rival astronomer but its real author\r\nwas subsequently found to be richard adams locke who declared that\r\nhis original intention was to satirise the extravagances of dicks\r\nwritings and to make certain suggestions which he had some diffidence\r\nin putting forward seriously whatever may have been his object the\r\nwork as a hit was unrivalled for months the press of america and\r\neurope teemed with the subject the account was printed and published\r\nin many languages and superbly illustrated but finally sir john\r\nherschels signed denial gave the mad story its quietus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nix the chevalier deon\r\n\r\n\r\nin all the range of doubtful personalities there is hardly any one whom\r\nconvention has treated worse than it has the individual known in his\r\ntimeand afteras the chevalier deon for about a hundred and fifty\r\nyears he has been written ofand spoken of for the first half century\r\nof that timesimply as a man who masqueraded in womans clothes there\r\nseems to be just sufficient truth in this to save certain writers\r\non the subject from the charge of deliberate lyinga record which\r\neven if it is to be posthumous no man of integrity aims at but it\r\nis abundantly evident that the rumour which in time became a charge\r\nwas originally set on foot deliberately by his political enemies who\r\ntreated him and his memory without either consideration or even the\r\nelements of honourable truth to begin with here are the facts of his\r\nlong life\r\n\r\ncharlesgenevievelouisaugusteandretimothée deon de beaumont was\r\nborn in  in tonnerre in yonne a department of france in the old\r\nprovince of burgundy his father louis deon was a parliamentary\r\nbarrister as a youth he was so apt in his studies at the collège\r\nmazarin that he received by special privilege his degree of doctor in\r\ncanon and civil law before the age appointed for the conferring of such\r\nhonour and was then enrolled in the list of parliamentary barristers\r\nin paris at first he had been uncertain which department of life he\r\nshould undertake he swayed on one side towards the church on the\r\nother towards the world of letters and beauxarts he was by habit\r\nan athlete and was so good a swordsman that later on he had no rival\r\nin fencing except the chevalier de saintgeorge in his twentyfifth\r\nyear he published two remarkable books one was on the political\r\nadministration of ancient and modern people and the other on phases\r\nof finance in france at different times the latter was afterwards\r\npublished in german at berlin in  and so impressed the then king\r\nof prussia that he gave orders that its ideas were to be carried into\r\npractical effect\r\n\r\nillustration the chevalier deon\r\n\r\nin  the prince de conti to whose notice the chevalier had been\r\nbrought by the above books asked the king louis xv to send him to\r\nrussia on a secret mission with the chevalier douglas and from that\r\ntime till the kings death in  he was his trusted loyal agent\r\nand correspondent deons special mission was to bring the courts\r\nof france and russia closer than had been their wont and also to\r\nobtain for the prince de conti who was seeking the dukedom of finland\r\nand the kingship of poland the favour of the empress elizabetha\r\ndifficult task which had already cost m de valcroissant a spell\r\nof imprisonment in order to accomplish his mission deon disguised\r\nhimself as a woman and in this guise he was able to creep into the\r\ngood graces of the empress he became her reader and was thus enabled\r\nto prepare her for the reception of the secret purposes of his king\r\nin the following year he returned to france whence he was immediately\r\nsent again to st petersburg with the title of secretary of embassy\r\nbut this time he went in his mans clothes and as the brother of the\r\npretended female reader by this time he had been made a lieutenant of\r\ndragoons he came in spite of the russian chancellor bestuchéf who\r\nsaw in the young soldierdiplomat un subject dangereux et capable de\r\nboulverser lempire this time his real mission was to destroy in\r\nthe mind of the empress faith in bestuchéf who was trying to hold the\r\nrussian army inactive and so deprive france of the advantages of the\r\ntreaty of versailles this he did so well that he was in a position to\r\nprove to the empress that her chancellor had betrayed her interests\r\nbestuchéf was arrested and his post conferred on count woronzow\r\nwhose attitude was altogether favourable to france the gratitude of\r\nking louis was shewn by his making deon a captain of dragoons and\r\nconferring on him a pension of  livres he was also made censor of\r\nhistory and literature deon threw himself with his accustomed zeal\r\ninto the service of the army and distinguished himself by his courage\r\nin the battles of hoecht of ultrop where he was wounded of eimbech\r\nwhere he put the scotch to flight and of osterkirk where at the head\r\nof  dragoons and  hussars he overthrew a battalion of the enemy\r\n\r\nno better conventional proof of the accepted idea of deons military\r\nworthiness can be given than the frequency and importance of the\r\noccasions on which he was honoured by the carrying of despatches he\r\nbrought news of his successful negotiations for the peace of versailles\r\nfrom vienna in  he was also sent with the ratification of the\r\ntreaty he carried the despatches of the great victory of the troops of\r\nmaria theresa forestalling the austrian courier by a day and a half\r\nalthough he had a broken leg\r\n\r\nwhen next sent to russia deon was sent as minister plenipotentiary\r\nan office which he held up to  when to the regret of the empress\r\nhe was recalled when he was leaving woronzow the successor of\r\nbestuchéf said to him i am sorry you are going although your first\r\njourney with chevalier douglas cost my sovereign  men and more\r\nthan  roubles deon answered your excellency ought to\r\nbe happy that your sovereign and his minister have gained more glory\r\nand reputation than any others in the world on his return deon\r\nwas appointed to the regiment dautchamp and gazetted as adjutant to\r\nmarshal de broglie then he was sent to russia for the fourth time\r\nas minister plenipotentiary in place of baron de breuteuil but peter\r\niii was dethroned so the outgoing ambassador remained in russia\r\nand deon went to england as secretary to the embassy of the duke de\r\nnivernais in \r\n\r\nafter the peace of  deon was chosen by the king of england to\r\ncarry the despatches he received for this office the star of st louis\r\nfrom the breast of the king who on giving it said it was for the\r\nbravery which he had displayed as a soldier and for the intelligence\r\nwhich he had shown in the negotiations between london and st\r\npetersburg\r\n\r\nat this time all went well with him but his good fortune was changed\r\nby the bitter intrigues of his enemies he was devoted to the king\r\nbut had almost as a direct consequence the enmity of the courtesans\r\nwho surrounded him and wished for the opportunity of plucking him\r\nat their leisure he had an astonishing knowledge on all matters of\r\nfinance and apprised the king privately of secret matters which his\r\nministers tried to hide from him the court had wind of that direct\r\ncorrespondence with his majesty and therewith things were so managed\r\nthat the diplomatist got into trouble madame de pompadour surprised\r\nthe direct correspondence between the king and deon with the result\r\nthat the latter was persecuted by the jealous courtiers who intrigued\r\nuntil in  he was replaced at the embassy of london by the count de\r\nguerchy and he himself became the mark for all sorts of vexations and\r\npersecutions his deadly enemy the count de guerchy tried to have\r\nhim poisoned but the attempt failed deon took legal steps to punish\r\nthe attempt but every form of pressure was used to keep the case out\r\nof court an attempt was made to get the attorney general to enter a\r\nnolle prosequi but he refused to lend himself to the scheme and\r\nsent the matter to the court of kings bench there despite all the\r\ndifficulties of furthering such a charge against any one so protected\r\nas an ambassador it was declared on trial that the accused was guilty\r\nof the crime charged against him de guerchy accordingly had to return\r\nto france but deon remained in england though without employment to\r\nconsole him king louis gave him in  a pension of  livres and\r\nassured him that though he was ostensibly exiled this was done to cover\r\nup the protection extended to him deon according to the report of\r\nthe time was offered a bribe of  livres to give up certain\r\nstate papers then in his custody but to his honour he refused be the\r\nstory as it may deon up to the time of the death of louis \r\ncontinued to be in london the real representative of france though\r\nwithout any formal appointment\r\n\r\nduring this time one of the means employed with success by his enemies\r\nto injure the reputation of deon was to point out that he had passed\r\nhimself as a woman the disguise he wore on his first visit to russia\r\nhis clean shaven face his personal niceties the correctness of his\r\nlife all came to the aid of that supposition in england bets were\r\nmade and sporting companies formed for the purpose of verifying his\r\nsex designs were framed for the purpose of carrying him off in order\r\nto settle the vexed question by a personal examination some of the\r\nefforts he had to repel by violence in  and in  his friends\r\ntried to arrange that he should be allowed to return to france but he\r\nrefused all offers as the ministers insisted on making it a condition\r\nof his return that he should wear feminine apparel after the accession\r\nof louis xvi he obtained leave to return free from the embarrassing\r\nrestraint hitherto demanded as he was overwhelmed with debts he placed\r\nas a guarantee in the hands of lord ferrers an iron casket containing\r\nimportant french state papers the minister sent beaumarcheus to redeem\r\nthem and in  the chevalier returned to france he presented\r\nhimself at versailles in his full uniform of a captain of dragoons the\r\nqueen marie antoinette however wished to see him presented in female\r\ndress so the minister implored him to meet her wishes he consented\r\nand thenceforward not only wore womens clothes but called himself la\r\nchevalière deon in a letter addressed by him to madame de staël\r\nduring the french revolution he spoke of himself as citizeness of the\r\nnew republic of france and of the old republic of literature on nd\r\nseptember  he wrote to the count de maurepas although i detest\r\nchanges of costume yet they are hard at work at mademoiselle bertins\r\non my future and doleful dress which however i shall cut in pieces at\r\nthe first sound of the cannon shots as a matter of fact when war with\r\nengland became imminent he demanded to be allowed to take in the army\r\nthe position which he had won by bravery and as the price of honourable\r\nwounds the only reply he got was his immurement for two months in the\r\ncastle of dijon in  he returned to england which he never again\r\nleft in vain he appealed to the convention and then to the first\r\nconsul to be allowed to place his sword at the service of his country\r\nbut his prayer was not listened to used to the practice of the sword\r\nhis circumstances being desperate he then found in it a source of\r\nincome he gave in public assaultsatarms with the chevalier de\r\nsaintgeorge one of the most notable fencers of his time at length he\r\nwas given a small pension £ by george iii on which he subsisted\r\nduring the remainder of his life he died rd may \r\n\r\nin very fact chevalier deon is historically a much injured man his\r\nvocation was that of a secretservice agent of a nation surrounded with\r\nenemies and to her advantage he used his rare powers of mind and body\r\nhe was a very gallant soldier who won distinction in the field and\r\nwas wounded several times and in his endurance and his indifference\r\nto pain whilst carrying despatches of overwhelming importance he set\r\nan example that any soldier might follow with renown as a statesman\r\nand diplomatist and by the use of his faculties of inductive\r\nratiocination he averted great dangers from his country if there were\r\nnothing else to his credit he might well stand forth as a diplomatist\r\nwho had by his own exertions overthrown a dishonest russian chancellor\r\nand an unscrupulous french ambassador of course as he was an agent of\r\nsecret service he had cognisance of much political and international\r\nscheming which he had at times to frustrate at the risk of all which he\r\nheld dear but considering the time he lived in and the dangers which\r\nhe was always in the thick of in a survey of his life the only thing\r\na reader can find fault with is his yielding to the base idea of the\r\nflightyminded marie antoinette what to this irresponsible butterfly\r\nof fashion was the honour of a brave soldier or the reputation of an\r\nacute diplomatist who had deserved well of his country of course to\r\nher any such foolery as that to which she condemned deon was but the\r\nfancy of an idle moment but then the fancies of queens at idle moments\r\nmay be altogether destructive to someone that they may be destructive\r\nto themselves is shown in the record of the terrible atrocities of the\r\nrevolution which followed hard on the luxurious masquerades of trianon\r\nand versailles even to the queen of france the chevalier deon\r\nshould have been something of a guarded if not an honoured person he\r\nwas altogether a kings man he had been for many years the trusted\r\nand loyal servant of more than one king and from the kings immediate\r\ncircle the proper consideration should have been shown\r\n\r\nthere is something pitiful in the spectacle of this old gentleman of\r\nnearly eighty years of age who had in his time done so much being\r\ncompelled to earn a bare livelihood by the exploitation of the most\r\nsordid page in his historya page turned more than half a century\r\nbefore and then only turned at all in response to the call of public\r\nduty\r\n\r\nin his retirement deon showed more of his real nature than had been\r\npossible to him in the strenuous days when he had to be always vigilant\r\nand ready at an instants notice to conceal his intentionshis very\r\nthoughts here he showed a sensitiveness with which even his friends\r\ndid not credit him he had been so long silent as to matters of his\r\nown concern that they had begun to think he had lost the faculty not\r\nonly of making the thought known but even of the thought itself the\r\nfollowing paragraph from the london public advertiser of wednesday\r\nth november  shows more of the real man than may be found in\r\nany of his business letters or diplomatic reports\r\n\r\nthe chevalier deon with justice complains of our public prints they\r\nare eternally sending him to france while he is in body and soul fixed\r\nin this country they have lately confined him in the bastille when he\r\nfled to england as a country of liberty and they lately made a woman\r\nof him when not one of his enemies dared to put his manhood to the\r\nproof he makes no complaints of the english ladies\r\n\r\nin an issue of the same paper th november of the same year it is\r\nmentioned that the rt hon lord ferrars sir john fielding messrs\r\naddington wright and other worthy magistrates and gentlemen and\r\ntheir ladies did the chevalier deon the honour to dine with him in\r\nbrewer st golden square common proof that the chevalier deon is\r\nnot confined in the bastille deon was much too wily and too much\r\naccustomed to attack to allow diplomatic insinuations to pass unheeded\r\nhe was now beginning to apply his garnered experience to his own\r\nprotection\r\n\r\nfrom the above extract of th november one can note how the allegation\r\nas to his sex was beginning to rankle in the soldiers mind and how\r\nan open threat of punishment is conveyed in diplomatic form indeed\r\nhe had reason to take umbrage at the insinuation more than once had\r\nattempts been made to carry him off for the purpose of settling bets\r\nby a humiliating personal scrutiny from something of the same cause\r\nhis friends on his death caused an autopsy to be made before several\r\nwitnesses of position and repute amongst these were several surgeons\r\nincluding père elisée first surgeon to louis xviii the medical\r\ncertificate ran as follows\r\n\r\nje certifie par le présent avoir inspecté le corps du chevalier\r\ndeon en présénce de m

queen\r\nelizabeth had any descendants they need not have feared any discussion\r\nof her claims of descent the issue of the legality of her mothers\r\nmarriage had been tried exhaustively both before

have been a sufficient ancestor\r\nfor any king or any dynasty still had she left issue there might\r\nhave been lesser people descendants whose feelings in the matter of\r\npersonal and family pride

now\r\nand again in a way which is enlightening\r\n\r\nin a letter to the protector somerset in  when the princess\r\nelizabeth was  sir robert tyrwhitt says\r\n\r\n    i do verily believe that there hath been some secret promise\r\n    between my lady mistress ashley and the cofferer sir thomas\r\n    parry never to confess to death and if it be so it will never\r\n    be gotten of her unless by the kings majesty or else by your\r\n    grace\r\n\r\nin his girlhood of queen elizabeth mr frank a mumby writes of\r\nthis\r\n\r\n    elizabeth was as loyal to parry as to mrs ashley she\r\n    reinstated him after a years interval in his office as\r\n    cofferer and on her accession to the throne she appointed\r\n    him controller of the royal household she continued to confer\r\n    preferment upon both parry and his daughter to the end of their\r\n    livesconduct remarks miss strickland which naturally\r\n    induces a suspicion that secrets of great moment had been\r\n    confided to himsecrets that probably would have touched not\r\n    only the maiden name of his royal mistress but placed her life\r\n    in jeopardy and that he had preserved these inviolate the same\r\n    may be supposed with respect to mrs ashley to whom elizabeth\r\n    clung with unshaken tenacity through every storm\r\n\r\nmajor martin hume in his courtships of queen elizabeth says of the\r\nfavourable treatment of the governess and the cofferer\r\n\r\n    the confessions of ashley and parry are bad enough but they\r\n    probably kept back more than they told for on elizabeths\r\n    accession and for the rest of their lives they were treated\r\n    with marked favour parry was knighted and made treasurer of the\r\n    household and on mrs ashleys death in july  the queen\r\n    visited her in person and mourned her with great grief\r\n\r\nthe same writer says elsewhere in the book\r\n\r\n    lady harrington and mrs ashley were in fact the only ladies\r\n    about the queen who were absolutely in her confidence\r\n\r\nin a letter to the doge of venice in  giovanni michiel wrote\r\n\r\n    she elizabeth i understand having plainly said that she\r\n    will not marry even were they to give her the kings philip of\r\n    spain son don carlos philips son by his first wife or\r\n    find any other great prince i again respectfully remind your\r\n    serenity to enjoin secrecy about this\r\n\r\ncount de feria wrote in april \r\n\r\n    if my spies do not lie which i believe they do not for a\r\n    certain reason which they have recently given me i understand\r\n    that she elizabeth will not bear children\r\n\r\nat this time elizabeth was only  years of age\r\n\r\nthe following extract is taken from mr mumbys girlhood of queen\r\nelizabeth in which is given the translation taken from letis la vie\r\ndelizabeth the letter is from princess elizabeth to lord admiral\r\nseymour  apropos of his intentions regarding her\r\n\r\n    it has also been said that i have only refused you because i\r\n    was thinking of some one else i therefore entreat you my lord\r\n    to set your mind at rest on this subject and to be persuaded by\r\n    this declaration that up to this time i have not the slightest\r\n    intention of being married and that if ever i should think of\r\n    it which i do not believe is possible you would be the first\r\n    to whom i should make known my resolution\r\n\r\n\r\nc bisley\r\n\r\nthe place known to the great public as bisley is quite other than that\r\nunder present consideration bisley the ground for rifle competitions\r\nis in surrey thoughtfully placed in juxtaposition to an eminent\r\ncemetery it bears every indication of newnessso far as any locality\r\nof old earth can be new\r\n\r\nbut the other is the original place of the name possessing a\r\nrecorded history which goes back many hundreds of years it is in\r\ngloucestershire high up on the eastern side of the cotswold hills at\r\ntheir southern end where they rise above the little avon which runs\r\ninto the embouchure of the severn to the bristol channel the trace of\r\nroman occupation is all over that part of england when the pioneers\r\nof that strenuous nation made their essay on britain they came with\r\nthe intention of staying and today their splendid roads remain\r\nunsurpassedalmost unsurpassable in this part of the west country\r\nthere are several of them of which the chief are irmin or ermine\r\nstreet running from southampton through cirencester and gloucester\r\nto caerleon and ikenild street running from cirencester entering\r\ngloucestershire at eastleach i am particular about these roads as we\r\nmay require to notice them carefully there is really but one bisley in\r\nthis part of the country but the name is spelled so variously that the\r\nsimple phonetic spelling might well serve for a nucleating principle\r\nin all sorts of papers from acts of parliament and royal charters\r\ndown to local deeds of tenancy it is thus variedbisleigh bistlegh\r\nbyselegh bussely in this part of the cotswolds over is a common\r\npart of a name which was formerly used as a prefix such is not always\r\nat once apparent for the modern cartographer seems to prefer the modern\r\nword upper as the prefix attention is merely called to it here as\r\nlater on we shall have to consider it more carefully\r\n\r\nthe most interesting spot in the whole district is the house\r\novercourt which was once the manorhouse of bisley it stands close\r\nto bisley church from the graveyard of which it is only separated by a\r\nwicketgate the titledeeds of this house which is now in possession\r\nof the gordon family show that it was a part of the dower of queen\r\nelizabeth but the world went by it and little by little the estate\r\nof which it was a portion changed hands so that now the house remains\r\nalmost as an entity naturally enough the young princess elizabeth\r\nlived there for a time and one can still see the room she occupied a\r\nmediumsized room with mullioned windows having small diamondshaped\r\npanes set in lead after the pattern of the tudor period a great beam\r\nof oak not exactly trued with the adze but following the natural\r\ntrend of the wood crosses the ceiling the window looks out on a\r\nlittle walledin garden one of the flower beds of which is set in an\r\nantique stone receptacle of oblong shape which presents something of\r\nthe appearance of a stone coffin of the earlier ages of this more anon\r\n\r\nwhether at the time of the birth of elizabeth the mansion of overcourt\r\nwas itself in the kings possession is a little difficult to fathom\r\nfor in the confession of thomas parry written in  concerning\r\na period a little earlier it is said and i told her princess\r\nelizabeth further how he lord admiral thomas seymour would have\r\nhad her to have lands in gloucestershire called bisley as in parcel of\r\nexchange and in wales\r\n\r\nin addition to its natural desirability in the way of hygiene and\r\naltitude there seems to have been a wish on the part of family advisers\r\nof those having estates in the vicinity of this place to enlarge\r\ntheir possessions this was wise enough for in the disturbed state of\r\naffairs which ushered in the tudor dynasty and the effects of which\r\nstill continued it was of distinct benefit to have communities here\r\nand there large enough for self protection this idea held with many\r\nof the families as well as individuals whose names are associated\r\nwith bisley henry viii himself as overlord with ownership derived\r\nfrom the norman conquest had feudal claims on the de bohuns who\r\nrepresented all the local possessions of the dukedom of gloucester and\r\nthe earldoms of essex hereford and northampton also the greedy eyes of\r\ncertain strong men and families who had hopes that time and influence\r\nalready existing might later on bring them benefit were fixed on this\r\ndesirable spot thomas seymour the unscrupulous brother of the future\r\nlord protector was high in influence in the early days of the princess\r\nelizabeth and even then must have had ambitious designs of marrying\r\nher on the death of henry viii he had when lord sudeley married the\r\nkings widow within a few months of her widowhood and received a\r\ngrant of the royal possession at bisley which on his attainder passed\r\non to sir anthony kingston who doubtless had already marked it down as\r\nan objective of his cupidity\r\n\r\nthe hundred of bisley was one of the seven of cirencester which of\r\nold were farmed by the abbey of tewksbury its position was so full\r\nof possibilities of future development as to justify the acquisitive\r\nspirit of those who desired it in its bounds were what is now the\r\ntown of stroud as well as a whole line of mills which had in early\r\ndays great effect as they were workable by both wind and water power\r\nboth of which were to be had in profusion this little remote hamlet\r\nhad a progressive industry of its own in the shape of a manufacture of\r\nwoollen cloths it also represented dyeing in scarlet and was the place\r\nof origin of giles gobelin a famous dyer who gave his name to the\r\ngobelin tapestry\r\n\r\none other thing must be distinctly borne in mind regarding bisley in\r\nthe first half of the sixteenth century it was comparatively easy of\r\naccess from london for those who wished to go there a line drawn on\r\nthe map will show that on the way as points dappui were oxford\r\nand cirencester both of which were surrounded with good roads as\r\nbecame their importance as centres this line seems very short for its\r\nimportance today the journey is that of a morning and even in the\r\ntime of henry viii when horse traction was the only kind available\r\nthe points were not very distant as to time of traverse to henry who\r\ncommanded everything and had a myriad agents eager to display their\r\nenergy in his service all was simple and when he went ahunting\r\nin the forests which made a network far around berkeley castle his\r\nobjective could be easily won between breakfast and supper there was\r\nnot any difficulty therefore and not too much personal strain when he\r\nchose to visit his little daughter even though at the start one should\r\nbe at nether lypiat and the other at greenwich or hatfield or eltham\r\n\r\n\r\nd the tradition\r\n\r\nthe tradition is that the little princess elizabeth during her\r\nchildhood was sent away with her governess for change of air to bisley\r\nwhere the strong sweet air of the cotswold hills would brace her up\r\nthe healthy qualities of the place were known to her father and many\r\nothers of those around her whilst she was at overcourt word was sent\r\nto her governess that the king was coming to see his little daughter\r\nbut shortly before the time fixed and whilst his arrival was expected\r\nat any hour a frightful catastrophe happened the child who had been\r\nailing in a new way developed acute fever and before steps could be\r\ntaken even to arrange for her proper attendance and nursing she died\r\nthe governess feared to tell her fatherhenry viii had the sort of\r\ntemper which did not make for the happiness of those around him in her\r\ndespair she having hidden the body rushed off to the village to try\r\nto find some other child whose body could be substituted for that of\r\nthe dead princess so that the evil moment of disclosure of the sad fact\r\nmight be delayed till after his majestys departure but the population\r\nwas small and no girl child of any kind was available the distracted\r\nwoman then tried to find a living girl child who could be passed off\r\nfor the princess whose body could be hidden away for the time\r\n\r\nthroughout the little village and its surroundings was to be found no\r\ngirl child of an age reasonably suitable for the purpose required more\r\nthan ever distracted for time was flying by she determined to take\r\nthe greater risk of a boy substituteif a boy could be found happily\r\nfor the poor womans safety for her very life now hung in the balance\r\nthis venture was easy enough to begin there was a boy available\r\nand just such a boy as would suit the special purpose for which he was\r\nrequireda boy well known to the governess for the little princess\r\nhad taken a fancy to him and had lately been accustomed to play with\r\nhim moreover he was a pretty boy as might have been expected from\r\nthe circumstance of the little lady elizabeth having chosen him as her\r\nplaymate he was close at hand and available so he was clothed in the\r\ndress of the dead child they being of about equal stature and when\r\nthe kings forerider appeared the poor overwrought governess was able\r\nto breathe freely\r\n\r\nthe visit passed off successfully henry suspected nothing as the\r\nwhole thing had happened so swiftly there had been no antecedent\r\nanxiety elizabeth had been brought up in such dread of her father that\r\nhe had not at the rare intervals of his seeing her been accustomed to\r\nany affectionate effusiveness on her part and in his hurried visit he\r\nhad no time for baseless conjecture\r\n\r\nthen came the natural nemesis of such a deception as the dead could\r\nnot be brought back to life and as the imperious monarch who bore\r\nno thwarting of his wishes was under the impression that he could\r\ncount on his younger daughter as a pawn in the great game of political\r\nchess which he had entered on so deeply those who by now must have\r\nbeen in the secret did not and could not dare to make disclosure\r\nmoreover the difficulties and dangers to one and all involved would\r\nof necessity grow with each day that passed willy nilly they must go\r\non fortunately for the safety of their heads circumstances favoured\r\nthem the secret was up to now hidden in a remote village high up\r\non the side of the cotswold hills steep declivities guarded it from\r\ncasual intrusion and there was no trade beyond that occasional traffic\r\nnecessary for a small agricultural community the whole country as far\r\nas the eye could see was either royal domain or individual property\r\nowned or held by persons attached to the dynasty by blood or interest\r\n\r\nfacilities of intercommunication were few and slow and above all\r\nuncertain and therefore not to be relied on\r\n\r\nthis then was the beginning of the tradition which has existed locally\r\never since in such districts change is slow and what has been may\r\nwell be taken unless there be something to the contrary for what\r\nis the isolation of the hamlet in the cotswolds where the little\r\nprincess lived for a timeand is supposed to have diedis almost best\r\nexemplified by the fact that though the momentous secret has existed\r\nfor between three and four centuries no whisper of it has reached the\r\ngreat world without its confines not though the original subject of it\r\nwas the very centre of the wildest and longest battle which has ever\r\ntaken place since the world beganpolemical dynastic educational\r\ninternational commercial anyone living in any town in our own age\r\nwhere advance and expansiveness are matters of degree not of fact may\r\nfind it hard to believe that any such story nebulous though it may be\r\ncould exist unknown and unrecorded outside a place so tiny that its\r\nmost important details will not be found even on the ordnance map of an\r\ninch to the mile but a visit to bisley will set aside any such doubts\r\nthe place itself has hardly changed in any measure to be apparent as\r\na change in the three centuries and more the same buildings stand as\r\nof yore the same estate wall though more picturesque with lichen and\r\nwith individual stones corrugated by weather and dislocated by arboreal\r\ngrowths speak of an epoch ending with the tudor age the doors of\r\nthe great tithebarns which remain as souvenirs of extinct feudalism\r\nstill yawn wide on their festered hinges nay even the very trees show\r\namongst their ranks an extraordinary percentage of giants which have\r\nwithstood unimpaired all the changes that have been\r\n\r\nleaving busy and thriving stroud one climbs the long hill past lipiat\r\nand emerges in the village where time has suddenly ceased and we\r\nfind ourselves in the age and the surroundings which saw the house of\r\nyork fade into the tudor dynasty such a journey is almost a necessity\r\nfor a proper understanding of the story of the bisley boy which has\r\nby the effluxion of time attained to almost the grace and strength\r\nof a legend it is quite possible that though the place has stood\r\nstill the tradition has not for it is in the nature of intellectual\r\ngrowth to advance one must not look on the gloucestershire people\r\nas sleepysleepiness is no characteristic of that breezy upland\r\nbut dreaming whether its results be true or false does not depend\r\non sleep in cases like the present sleep is not to be looked on as\r\na blood relation of death but rather as a preservative against the\r\nravages of timelike the mysterious slumber of king arthur and others\r\nwho are destined for renewal\r\n\r\nit may be taken for granted that in course of time and under the\r\nprocess of purely oral communication the story told in whispers lost\r\nnothing in the way of romance or credibility that flaws or lacunæ\r\nwere made good by inquiry and that recollections of overlooked or\r\nforgotten facts were recalled or even supplemented by facile invention\r\nbut it may also be taken for granted that no statement devoid of a\r\nsolid foundation could become permanently accepted there were too\r\nmany critics around with memories unimpaired by overwork to allow\r\nincorrect statements to pass unchallenged there is always this in\r\ntradition that the collective mind which rules in small communities is\r\na childs mind which must ever hold grimly on to fact and that behind\r\nthe childs mind is the childs nature which most delights in the\r\nrecountal of what it knows and is jealous of any addition to the story\r\nwhich is a part of its being\r\n\r\nmajor martin hume writes in his courtships of queen elizabeth\r\n\r\n    elizabeth was only three when her mothers fall removed her from\r\n    the line of the succession in  however the death of\r\n    james v of scotland and the simultaneous birth of his daughter\r\n    mary seemed to bring nearer henrys idea of a union between the\r\n    two crowns he proposed to marry the baby queen of scots to his\r\n    infant son and at the same time he offered the hand of elizabeth\r\n    then nine to a son of arranhead of house of hamilton next\r\n    heir to the scottish crown mary and elizabeth were restored\r\n    to their places in the line of succession in january \r\n    henry viii died leaving the succession to his two daughters\r\n    in tail after edward vi and his heirs queen catherine parr\r\n    immediately married sir thomas seymour brother of protector\r\n    somerset and uncle of the little king edward vi to them was\r\n    confided princess elizabeth then a girl of \r\n\r\nelizabeth was three in  the story of the bisley boy dates probably\r\nto  so that if the story have any foundation at all in fact\r\nsigns of a complete change of identity in the person of princess\r\nelizabeth must be looked for in the period of some seven or eight years\r\nwhich intervened\r\n\r\n\r\ne the difficulty of proof\r\n\r\nin such a case as that before us the difficulty of proof is almost\r\ninsuperable but fortunately we are dealing with a point not of law\r\nbut of history proof is not in the first instance required but only\r\nsurmise to be followed by an argument of probability such records as\r\nstill exist are all the proofs that can be adduced and all we can do\r\nis to search for such records as still exist without which we lack\r\nthe enlightenment that waits on discovery in the meanwhile we can\r\ndeduce a just conclusion from such materials as we do possess failing\r\ncertitude which is under the circumstances almost impossible we only\r\narrive at probability and with that until discovery of more reliable\r\nmaterial we must be content\r\n\r\nlet us therefore sum up first the difficulties of the task before us\r\nthen the enlightenments facts says one of the characters of charles\r\ndickens bein stubborn and not easy drove are at least so far as\r\nthey go available we are free to come to conclusions and to make\r\ncritical comments our risk is that if we erron whichever side does\r\nnot matterwe reverse our position and become ourselves the objects of\r\nattack\r\n\r\nour main difficulties are two first that all from whom knowledge\r\nmight have been obtained are dead and their lips are closed second\r\nthat records are incomplete this latter is the result of one of two\r\ncausesnatural decay or purposed obliteration the tradition of the\r\nbisley boy has several addenda due to time and thought one of these is\r\nthat some of those concerned in the story disappeared from the scene\r\n\r\nthe story runs that on elizabeths accession or under circumstances\r\nantecedent to it all who were in the secret and still remained were\r\ngot rid of the phrase is a convenient one and not unknown in\r\nhistory fortunately those who must have been in such a secretif\r\nthere was onewere but few if such a thing occurred in reality four\r\npersons were necessarily involved in addition to elizabeth herself\r\n mrs ashley  thomas parry  the parent of the living child\r\nwho replaced the dead one the fourth being an unknown quantity\r\nrepresents an idea rather than a persona nucleated identity typical\r\nof family life with attendant difficulties of concealment of these\r\nfourthree real persons and an ideathree are accounted for so far\r\nas the got rid of theory is concerned elizabeth never told thomas\r\nparry and mrs ashley remained silent in the full confidence of the\r\nsupposed princess who later was queen with regard to the last the\r\nnucleated personality which includes the unknown parent possibly but\r\nnot of certainty contemporary record is silent and we can only regard\r\nhim or her as a mysterious entity available for conjecture in such\r\ncases of difficulty as may present themselves\r\n\r\nwe must perforce therefore fall back on pure unadulterated\r\nprobability based on such rags of fact as can be produced at our\r\ninquest our comfortcontent being an impossibilitymust lie in the\r\ngenerallyaccepted aphorism truth will prevail in real life it is\r\nnot always so but it is a comforting belief and may remain faut de\r\nmieux\r\n\r\na grave cause of misleading is inexact translationwhether the fault\r\nbe in ignorance or intentional additions to or substractions from\r\ntext referred to a case in point is afforded by the letter already\r\nreferred to from letis la vie delizabeth in the portion quoted\r\nelizabeth mentioned her intention of not marrying i have not the\r\nslightest intention of being married and  if ever i should think\r\nof it which i do not believe is possible now in mr mumbys book\r\nthe quotation is made from letis la vie delizabeth which is the\r\ntranslation into french from the original italian the passage marked\r\nabove in italics is simply ce que je ne crois pas the addition of\r\nthe words is possible gives what is under the circumstances quite\r\na different meaning to the earliest record we have concerning the\r\nvery point we are investigating when i began this investigation i\r\nlooked on the passageneither mumby remember nor even leti but\r\nwhat professed to be the ipsissima verba of elizabeth herselfand\r\ni was entirely misled until i had made comparison for myselfquis\r\ncustodiet ipsos custodes the addition of the two words which seems\r\nat first glance merely to emphasise an expression of opinion changes\r\nthe meaning of the writer to a belief so strong that the recital of it\r\ngives it the weight of intention under ordinary circumstances this\r\nwould not matter much but as we have to consider it in the light of\r\na man defending his head against danger and in a case where absolute\r\ncircumspection is a necessary condition of safety so that intention\r\nbecomes a paramount force exactness of expression is allimportant\r\n\r\nthe only way to arrive at probability is to begin with fact such is\r\na base for even credulity or its opposite and if it is our wish or\r\nintention to be just there need be no straining on either one side or\r\nthe other in the case of the bisley boy the points to be considered\r\nare\r\n\r\n the time at which the change was or could be affected\r\n\r\n the risk of discovery a at first b afterwards\r\n\r\nit will be necessary to consider these separately for manifest reasons\r\nthe first belongs to the region of danger the second to the region\r\nof difficulty with the headsmans axe glittering ominously in the\r\nbackground\r\n\r\n\r\nf the time and the opportunity\r\n\r\na the time at which the change was or could have been effected\r\n\r\nfor several valid reasons i have come to the conclusion that the\r\ncrucial period by which the bisley story must be tested is the year\r\nending with july  no other time either earlier or later would so\r\nfar as we know have fulfilled the necessary conditions\r\n\r\nfirst of all the question of sex has to be considered and it is herein\r\nthat lacking suitable and full opportunity discovery of such an\r\nimposture must have been at once detectedcertainly had it commenced\r\nat an early age in babyhood the whole of the discipline of childlife\r\nbegins the ordinary cleanliness of life has to be taught and to this\r\nend there is no portion of the infantile body which is not subject to\r\nat least occasional inspection this disciplinary inspection lasts\r\nby force of habit until another stage on the journey towards puberty\r\nhas been reached commercial use in america fixes stages of incipient\r\nwomanhoodby dry goods advertisementas childrens misses and\r\ngirls clothing and the illustration will sufficiently serve it\r\nseems at first glance an almost unnecessary intrusion into purely\r\ndomestic life but the present is just one of those cases where the\r\nexperience of women is not only useful but necessary in a question\r\nof identity of sex the nursemaid and the washerwoman play useful\r\nparts in the witness box regarding elizabeths childhood no question\r\nneed ever or can ever arise for at least the first ten years of her\r\nlife a womans sex need not be known outside the nursery and the\r\nsick room but then this is the very time when her attendants have\r\ndirect and ample knowledge moreover in the case of the child of queen\r\nanne boleyn there was every reason why the sex should have been\r\nunreservedly known henry viii divorced katherine of aragon and married\r\nanne in the hope of having legitimate male issue to sit on the throne\r\nof england later when both katherine and anne had failed to satisfy\r\nhim as to male issue he divorced anne and married jane seymour for\r\nthe same purpose in the interval either his views had enlarged or\r\nhis patience had extended for when janes life hung in the balance\r\nowing to an operation which the surgeons considered necessary and the\r\nhusband was consulted as to which life they should in case of needful\r\nchoice try to save his reply was peculiarthough taken in the light\r\nof historical perspective not at variance with his dominating idea\r\ngregorio leti thus describes the incident the quotation is made from\r\nthe translation of the italian into french and published in amsterdam\r\nin \r\n\r\n    quand les médécins demandèrent au roi qui lon sauverait de\r\n    la mère ou de lenfant il répondit quil auroit extremement\r\n    souhait de pouvoir sauver la mère et lenfant mais que cel\r\n    nétant possible il vouloit que lon sauvat lenfant plutôt que\r\n    la mère parce quil trouveroit assez dautres femmes\r\n\r\nit had become a monomania with henry that he should be father of a\r\nlawful son and when the child of his second union was expected he\r\nso took the consummation of his wishes for granted that those in\r\nattendance on his wife were actually afraid to tell him the truth it\r\nwould have been fortune and social honour to whosoever should bear\r\nhim the glad tidings we may be sure then that news so welcome would\r\nnever have been perverted by those who had so much to gain as it was\r\nthe ladymistressas she called herselfof the little princess\r\nmrs afterwards lady bryan wrote in her letter to lord cromwell in\r\nelizabeth being then in her third year\r\n\r\n    she is as toward a child and as gentle of conditions as ever i\r\n    knew any in my life\r\n\r\nthe writer could have had no ignorance as to the sex of the child for\r\nin the same letter she gives cromwell a list of her wants in the way\r\nof clothing which list is of the most intimate kind including gown\r\nkirtle petticoat no manner of linen nor smocks kerchiefs rails\r\nbody stitchets handkerchiefs sleeves mufflers biggens as in the\r\nsame letter it is mentioned that the women attending the child were\r\nunder the rule of lady bryanan accomplished nurse who had brought up\r\nprincess mary and had been governess to the children his grace have\r\nhad ever sinceit can be easily understood she was well acquainted\r\nwith even the smallest detail of the royal nursery had the trouble of\r\nthe ladymistress been with regard to superabundance of underclothing\r\none might have understood ignorance on the part of the responsible\r\ncontroller but in the plentiful lack of almost every garment necessary\r\nfor the childs wear by day or by night there could be no question as\r\nto her ostensible sex at this age\r\n\r\nthence on there were experienced and devoted persons round the little\r\nprincess whose value in her fathers eyes was largely enhanced since\r\nhe had secured for the time her legitimacy by an act of parliament\r\n\r\nafter elizabeth had been legitimised she became one of the pieces in\r\nthe gigantic game of chess on which henry had embarked despite the\r\nfact that the son for whom he had craved was now a boy of six it was\r\nonly wise to consider and be prepared for whatever might happen in case\r\nprince edward should not live and if in such a case mary should die\r\nwithout issue the case was one of amazing complexity and as the time\r\nwore on the religious question became structurally involved england\r\nhad declared in no uncertain voice in favour of protestantism and the\r\nwhole forces of rome were arrayed against her mary was altogether in\r\nfavour of the religion of her injured mother and behind her stood the\r\npower of catholicism which even in that unscrupulous age was well\r\nahead in the race of unscrupulousness and as elizabeth stood next\r\nto the young prince edward in the forces of reformation on her was\r\nfocussed much of the suspicion of polemic intrigue the papacy was all\r\npowerful in matters of secret inquiry indeed in such an inquest its\r\npowers were unique for unscrupulous spies were everywhereeven it\r\nwas alleged in the confessional how then could such a secret as the\r\nsex of a little girl of not a dozen years of age who was constantly\r\nsurrounded by women necessarily conversant with every detail of her\r\nlife be kept from all who wished to solve it in such a state of\r\naffairs suspicion was equivalent to discovery and discovery meant ruin\r\nto all concerned death to abettors of the fraud woe and destruction\r\nto england and a general upheaval of the fundamental ideas of\r\nchristendom it may i presume be taken for granted without flaw or\r\nmitigation of any kind that up to july  the princess elizabeth\r\nwas what she appeared to bea girl\r\n\r\nat the time of her first letter to the new queen catherine parr she\r\nwas just a trifle under ten years of age and a wellgrown child quick\r\nclever rather precocious and well grounded in the learning of her\r\ntime the exact date of this letter is not given by letiof which more\r\nanonbut it must have been somewhere between july  and  \r\nhenry viii married catherine parr on  july and in her letter of \r\nelizabeth calls catherine your majesty in her letter of  july\r\n she writes to the same correspondent\r\n\r\n     has deprived me for a whole year of your most illustrious\r\n    presence\r\n\r\nthe whereabouts of elizabeth during this last year appears to be the\r\ncentre of the mystery and if any letter or proof is ever found of\r\nelizabeths being anywhere but in her own house of overcourt in bisley\r\nparish it will go far to settle the vexed question now brought before\r\nthe world for the first time\r\n\r\n\r\nb the opportunity\r\n\r\nthe year  was a busy time for henry viii he had on hand either\r\npending or going on two momentous wars one with scotland the other\r\nwith france the causes of either of these were too complicated for\r\nmention here suffice it to say that they were chiefly dynastic and\r\npolemic in addition he was busy with matrimonial matters chiefly\r\nkilling off his fifth wife catherine howard and casting eyes on the\r\nnewmade widow of lord latimer in  he married the lady as his\r\nsixth wife she herself can hardly be said to have lacked matrimonial\r\nexperience as this was her third union her first venture was with\r\nthe elderly lord borough who like lord latimer left her wealthy\r\nhenry had by now got what might be called in the slang of the time the\r\nmarriage habit and honeymoon dalliance had hardly the same charm\r\nfor him as it usually is supposed to have with those blessed with a\r\nlesser succession of spouses the consequence was that he was able to\r\ngive more attention to the necessary clearing up of the scottish war\r\nwhich finished at solway moss on december th with the consequent\r\ndeath from chagrin of the scottish king james v the cause of the war\r\nhowever continued in the shape of a war with france which went on till\r\n when peace was declared to the pecuniary benefit of the english\r\nking for the last two years of this time henry carried on the war\r\nsinglehanded as the emperor charles v who had begun it as his ally\r\nwithdrew\r\n\r\nthere is a paragraph in graftons chronicle published

promise much for\r\nmaternity at the same time mary though his eldest living daughter\r\nwas the hope of the catholic party to which he was in violent\r\nopposition whereas in elizabeth lay the hope of the whole of the party\r\nof the reformation her life was to her father far beyond the calls of\r\nparental affection or dynastic ambition and she had to be saved at all\r\ncosts from risk of health henrys own experience of childlife was a\r\nbitter one of his five children by catherine of aragon only one mary\r\nsurvived childhood elizabeth was the only survivor of anne boleyn\r\nedward of jane seymour anne of cleves had no children and if report\r\nspoke truly no chance of having any catherine howard was executed\r\nchildless and he had only just married catherine parr who had already\r\nhad two husbands\r\n\r\non july   henry married catherine and in due course devoted\r\nhimself to the war on the  july  he crossed from dover to\r\ncalais to look after the conduct of affairs for himself and on the\r\nth began the siege of boulogne this lasted for two months when\r\nhaving reduced the city he returned home on the  september he wrote\r\nto his wife to that effect during his absence queen catherine was\r\nvicegerent and had manifestly as much public work on hand as she\r\ncould cope with bisley was a long way from london and there were no\r\norganised posts in the sixteenth century moreover ever since his\r\nlast marriage henry had been an invalid he was now fiftytwo years\r\nof age of unhealthy body and so heavy that he had to be lifted\r\nby machinery catherine was a devoted wife and as henry was both\r\nviolent and irritable she had little time at command to give to the\r\naffairs of other people there was small opportunity for any one then\r\nwho was sufficiently in the focus of affairs to be cognisant of such\r\nan imposture as the tradition points out doubtless hereafter when\r\na story so fascinating and at first glance so incredible begins to\r\nbe examined and its details thoroughly threshed out more items of\r\nevidence or surmise than are at present available will be found for\r\nthe settlement of the question one way or the other in the meantime\r\nbe it remembered that we are only examining offhand a tradition made\r\nknown for the first time after three centuries our present business is\r\nto consider possibilities later on the time may comeas it surely\r\nwill if the story can in the least be acceptedfor the consideration\r\nof probabilities both of these tentative examinations will lead to\r\nthe final examination of possibility of probability and of proof\r\npro or contra\r\n\r\nat this stage we must admit that neither time nor opportunity present\r\nany difficulty in itself insuperable\r\n\r\n\r\ng the identity of elizabeth\r\n\r\na documents\r\n\r\nthe next matter with which we have to deal is regarding the identity of\r\nelizabeth this needs if necessary a consideration of the facts of\r\nher life and so far as we can realise them from external appearance\r\nmental and moral attitudes and intentions on account of space we\r\nmust confine this branch of the subject to the smallest portion of\r\ntime necessary to form any sort of just conclusion and accepting the\r\navailable records up to  take the next period from that time\r\nto anywhere within the first few years of her reignby which time\r\nher character was finally fixed and the policy on which her place in\r\nhistory is to be judged had been formulated and tested\r\n\r\nthis implies in the first instance a brief very brief study of her\r\nphysique with a corollary in the shape of a few remarks on her heredity\r\n\r\ngraftons chronicle states under the date of  september \r\nthe queene was delivered of a fayre lady which was his courtly way\r\nof announcing the birth of a female princess blond in colour in all\r\nchronicles fayre means of light colour in wintown the reputed father\r\nof macbeththe devilis spoken of as a fayre man evil qualities\r\nwere in that age attributed to blondes\r\n\r\nin a letter dated from greenwich palace  april  sir\r\nwilliam kingston said to lord lisle today the king and queen\r\nwere at eltham where the royal nursery then was and saw my lady\r\nprincessas goodly a child as hath been seen her grace is much in the\r\nkings favour as a goodly child should begod save her\r\n\r\nin  when elizabeth was but three years old lady bryan the\r\nladymistress of both mary and her halfsister wrote from hunsdon\r\nto lord cromwell regarding the baby princess for she is as toward\r\na child and as gentle of conditions as ever i knew any in my life\r\njesus preserve her grace in the same letter she says mr shelton\r\nwould have my lady elizabeth to dine and sup every day at the board\r\nof estate alas my lord it is not meet for a child of her age to keep\r\nsuch rule yet i promise you my lord i dare not take it upon me to\r\nkeep her grace in health an she keep that rule for there she shall\r\nsee divers meats and fruits and wines which it would be hard for\r\nme to restrain her grace from ye know my lord there is no place of\r\ncorrection there and she is yet too young to correct greatly\r\n\r\ntestimony is borne according to leti to the good qualities of the\r\nprincess elizabeth in these early years by the affectionate regard in\r\nwhich she was held by two of henrys queens the wronged and unhappy\r\nanne of cleves and the happynatured catherine parr anne he says\r\nthough she had only seen her twice loved her much she thought her\r\nbeautiful and full of spirit pleine desprit catherine according\r\nto the same writer who had seen her often before her marriage to henry\r\nadmired her esprit et ses manières\r\n\r\nif leti could only have spoken at first hand his record of her would\r\nbe very valuable but unhappily he was only born nearly thirty years\r\nafter her death his history was manifestly written from records and as\r\nelizabeths fame was already made before he began to treat of her his\r\nwork is largely a panegyric of hearsay there is regarding the youth\r\nof the princess such an overdone flood of adulation that it is out of\r\nplace in a serious history of a human life in his account of the time\r\nwhich we are considering we find the child compared in both matters\r\nof body and mind to an angel she is credited at the age of ten with an\r\namount of knowledge in all branches of learning sufficient to equip the\r\nillustrious men of a century the fact is the italian has accepted the\r\nqueens great position and then reconstructed her youth to accord with\r\nit in such a way as to show that whatever remarkable abilities she\r\npossessed were the direct outcome of her own natural qualities\r\n\r\n     amongst other branches of knowledge he credits her with\r\n        knowing well geography cosmography mathematics\r\n        architecture painting arithmetic history mechanics she\r\n        had a special facility in learning languages spoke and wrote\r\n        french italian spanish flemish she loved poetry and wrote\r\n        it but regarded it as a useless amusement and as it was\r\n        distasteful to her turned to history and politics finally\r\n        he adds she was naturally ambitious and always knew how to\r\n        hide her defects\r\n\r\nthe details above given are not merely meagre but are only explicable\r\nby the fact that during the earlier years of her life the child\r\nwas not considered of any importance the circumstances of annes\r\nmarriagewhich in any case was delayed till it became a necessary\r\npreliminary to the legitimacy on which any future claim to the throne\r\nmust restdid not make for a belief in the public mind for its\r\npermanency things were fluctuating in the religious world and few\r\nwere inclined to the belief that the pope with whom lay the last\r\nword and whose political leanings in favour of catherine of aragon\r\nand the validity of her marriage to henry were well known would be\r\noverthrown by the english king and in any case were henry to be the\r\nfinal judge of appeal in his own case no great continuity of purpose\r\ncould be expected from him the first important event which we have\r\nto consider with reference to the question before us is elizabeths\r\nfirst letter to queen catherine parr in  in this the girl then\r\nten years old writes to her new stepmother at whose marriage she\r\ntogether with her halfsister mary had been present it is in form a\r\ndutiful letter not entirely without an apparent compulsion or at least\r\nintelligent supervision as it stands it is impossible to believe\r\nthat it emanated from a child of ten quite free to follow out its\r\ninclinations the dutifulness is altogether or largely due to the\r\ntraining and selfsuppression of the royal child of an arbitrary father\r\nwith absolute power but it remains for each reader to consider it\r\nimpartially the points which we should do well to note here are its\r\nplain form of expression and its entire absence of personal affection\r\nthe latter is all the more marked in that it was a letter of thanks for\r\na kindness conferred elizabeth was very anxious to come to her father\r\nand catherine had furthered her wish and secured its fulfilment after\r\nthe marriage the child as is shown or rather inferred had been\r\nsent away for more than a year which absence had been prolonged for at\r\nleast six monthsas already shown\r\n\r\nthere is little evidence of elizabeths inner nature in these early\r\ndays but we have every right to think that she was of a peaceable\r\nkindly and affectionate nature lady bryan her first nurse or governess\r\nafter lady boleyn annes mother thought highly of her catherine\r\nashley who had charge of her next loved her and was her devoted\r\nservant friend and confidant till her death\r\n\r\nthomas parry her lifelong friend was devoted to her and when the\r\ncircumstances of their respective lives and the happenings of the time\r\nkept them apart she restored him at the first opportunity and made his\r\nfortune her special care\r\n\r\nthere is little base here on which to build an inverted pyramid our\r\nonly safety is in taking things as they seem to be and using common\r\nsense\r\n\r\n\r\nb changes\r\n\r\nlet us now take the years beginning with  from this time on more\r\nis known of the personality of elizabeth in fact there is little\r\nunknown that is of matters of fact and to this only we must devote\r\nourselves whatever may have been elizabeths motives we can only infer\r\nthem she was a secretive person and took few into her confidence\r\nunless it was of vital necessityand then only in matters required by\r\nthe circumstance the earliest knowledge we have of this second period\r\nof her history is in her letter to queen catherine parr written from\r\nst james palace on  july \r\n\r\nin the year which had elapsed since her last recorded letter\r\nelizabeths literary style had entirely changed the meagre grudging\r\nstyle has become elegant and even florid with the ornate grace and\r\nimagery afforded by the study of the latin and french tongues\r\naltogether there is not merely a more accomplished diction but there\r\nis behind it a truer feeling and larger sympathy it is more in accord\r\nwith the letter accompanying the gift to the queen of her translation\r\nof the mirror of the sinful soul which she had dedicated to her\r\n\r\nhistorians have given various rescripts of certain earlier letters of\r\nthe princess elizabeth but none of them seem in harmony of thought\r\nwith this whereas it is quite in accord with her later writings\r\nmetabolism is an accepted doctrine of physiology but its scope is\r\nnotas yet at all eventsextended to the intellect and we must take\r\nthings as we find them within the limits of human knowledge\r\n\r\nit will perhaps be as well to reserve the consideration of any other\r\npoint except the change in actual identity till the complete analogy\r\nof all natural processes is an established fact\r\n\r\n\r\nc her personality\r\n\r\nwe have no letters of princess elizabeth before  which are not open\r\nto grave doubt as to date but there is one letter to which allusion\r\nmust almost of necessity be made it is a letter from roger ascham\r\ntutor to the princess elizabeth to mrs ashley no date is given\r\nby mr mumby but he states in his text that it was written during\r\ngrindals term of office as tutor to the princess mumby quotes from\r\nthe elizabeth of miss strickland who in turn quotes from whittakers\r\nrichmondshire now grindals term of office lasted from \r\nprobably the end of that year till it was cut short by his death from\r\nthe plague in  so that he could not have known his royal pupil\r\nbefore  the text of the letter leads a careful reader to infer\r\nthat it was written after that date the important part of the letter\r\nis as follows\r\n\r\n     the thanks you have deserved from that noble imp by your\r\n    labour and wisdom now flourishing in all goodly godliness i\r\n    wish her grace elizabeth to come to that end in perfectness\r\n    and likelihood of her wit and painlessness in her study true\r\n    trade of her teaching which your diligent overseeing doth most\r\n    constantly promise i wish all increase of virtue and honour\r\n    to that my good lady whose wit good mrs ashley i beeseech\r\n    you somewhat favour blunt edges be dull and dure much pain to\r\n    little profit the free edge is soon turned if it be not handled\r\n    thereafter if you pour much drink at once into a goblet the\r\n    most part will dash out and run over if ye pour it softly you\r\n    may fill it even to the top and so her grace i doubt not by\r\n    little and little may be increased in learning that at length\r\n    greater cannot be required\r\n\r\nif this letter means anything at allwhich in the case of such a man\r\nas roger ascham is not to be doubtedit means that mrs ashley then\r\nher governess was cautioned not to press the little girl overmuch\r\nin her lessons it is an acknowledgment of the teachers zeal as well\r\nas affection and in the flowery and involved style of the period and\r\nthe man illustrates the theory by pointing out the error of trying to\r\nfill a small vessel from a larger one by pouring too fast she is not\r\na backward child he says in effect but go slowly with her education\r\nyou cannot give full learning all at once\r\n\r\ncompare this letter with that of the same writer to john sturmius\r\nrector of the protestant university of strasbourg on the same subject\r\nin \r\n\r\n    the lady elizabeth has accomplished her sixteenth year and so\r\n    much of solidity of understanding such courtesy united with\r\n    dignity have never been observed at so early an age she has\r\n    the most ardent love of true religion and of the best kind of\r\n    literature the constitution of her mind is exempt from female\r\n    weakness and she is endued with a masculine power of application\r\n\r\n    no apprehension can be quicker than hers no memory more\r\n    retentive french and italian she speaks like english latin with\r\n    fluency propriety and judgment she also spoke greek with me\r\n    frequently willingly and understanding well nothing can be\r\n    more elegant than her handwriting whether in the greek or roman\r\n    character in music she is very skilful but does not greatly\r\n    delight with respect to personal decoration she greatly prefers\r\n    a simple elegance to show and splendour so despising the outward\r\n    adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold that in\r\n    the whole manner of her life she rather resembles hippolyta than\r\n    phædra\r\n\r\nthat such a scholar as roger ascham makes the simile is marked\r\nhippolyta was a queen of the amazons and phædra was an almost\r\npreternaturally womanly woman one with a tragic intensity of passion\r\n\r\nthe elizabeth whom we know from  to  certainly had brains\r\nenough to protect her neck in  sir robert tyrwhitt wrote to the\r\nprotector somerset apropos of the strenuous effort being made to gain\r\nfrom her some admission damaging to herself concerning thomas seymours\r\nattempts to win her hand\r\n\r\nshe hath a very pretty wit and nothing is gotten out of her but by\r\ngreat policy\r\n\r\nin a letter from simon renard ambassador to the emperor charles v dated\r\nlondon september   there is incidentally a statement regarding\r\nelizabeths character which it is wise to hold in mind when discussing\r\nthis particular period of her history writing of elizabeths first\r\nattendance at mass he said she mary  entreated madame elizabeth\r\nto speak freely of all that was on her conscience to which the\r\nprincess replied that she was resolved to declare publicly that in\r\ngoing to mass as in all else that she had done she had only obeyed the\r\nvoice of her conscience and that she had acted freely without fear\r\ndeceit or pretence we have since been told however that the said\r\nlady elizabeth is very timid and that while she was speaking with the\r\nqueen she trembled very much\r\n\r\ncompare with this the letter of th march  to the queen mary\r\nwritten just as she was told to go to the tower in this letter which\r\nis beautifully written and with not a trace of agitation she protests\r\nher innocence of any plot her mental attitude was thoroughly borne\r\nout by a calm dignity of demeanour which is more in accord with male\r\nthan female nature in very fact elizabeth appears all her life since\r\n to have been playing with great thoughtfulness and yet dexterity a\r\ndiplomatic gameacting with histrionic subtlety a part which she had\r\nchosen advisedly\r\n\r\na good idea of the personality of elizabeth during the period beginning\r\nwith  may be had from a brief consideration of the risks which a\r\nperson taking up such an imposture would run first at the time of\r\nbeginning the venture and then of sustaining the undertaken rôle\r\nat the outset a boy of ten or eleven would not think of taking it\r\nseriously at first he would look on it as a lark and carry out the\r\nidea with a serious energy only known in playtime later thought\r\nwould give it a new charm in the shape of danger this while adding\r\nto his great zest would sober him thence on it would be a gamejust\r\nsuch a game as a boy loves perpetual struggle to get the best of\r\nsomeone else to some natures wit against wit is a better strife than\r\nstrength against strength and if one were well equipped for such a\r\nfray the game would satisfy the ambition of his years in any case when\r\nonce such a game was entered on the stake would be his own heada\r\nconsideration which must undoubtedly make for strenuous efforteven in\r\nboyhood\r\n\r\nthe task which would have followedwhich did follow if the bisley\r\nstory is truewould have been vastly greater if the imposture\r\nescaped immediate detectionwhich is easily conceivablea new kind\r\nof endeavour would have been necessary one demanding the utmost care\r\nand perpetual vigilance in addition to the personal qualities necessary\r\nfor the carrying out of the scheme little help could be given to the\r\nyoung boy on whom rested the weight of what must have appeared to all\r\nconcerned in it a stupendous undertaking from the nature of the task\r\nwhich was one which even the faintest breath of suspicion would have\r\nruined the little band originally involved could gain no assistance\r\nsafety was only possible by the maintenance of the most rigid secrecy\r\nall around them were enemies served by a host of zealous spies if then\r\nthe story be true those who carried such an enterprising situation\r\nto lasting success must have been no common persons let us suppose\r\nfor a moment that the story was true in such case the boy of bisley\r\nwho acted the part of the princess elizabeth could have had only two\r\nassistantsassistants even if they were only passive whatever may\r\nhave happened we know from history that both mrs ashley and thomas\r\nparry were ingrainedly loyal to elizabeth as she was to them for\r\nconvenience we shall speak of the substitute of the princess as\r\nthough he were the princess herself whom he appeared to be and for\r\nwhom he was accepted thenceforth that the impostureif there was\r\nonesucceeded is a selfevident fact for almost sixty years there was\r\nno question raised by any person of either sex and of any political\r\nopinion the statecraft of england france the papacy and the german\r\nempire were either unsuspicious or in erroror both it is reasonable\r\nto imagine that a person of strong character and active intelligence\r\nmight have steered deftly between these variously opposing forces it\r\nis conceivable that in the case of a few individuals there might have\r\nbeen stray fragmentary clouds of suspicion though if there were any\r\nthey must have come to those who were held to a consequent inactivity\r\nby other dominating causes we shall have occasion presently to touch\r\non this subject but in the meantime we must accept it that there was no\r\nopinion expressed by any one in such a way as necessarily to provoke\r\naction of course after a time even suspicion became an impossibility\r\nhere was a young girl growing into womanhood whom all around her had\r\nknown all her lifeor what was equivalentbelieved they had it is\r\nonly now after three centuries that we can consider who it was that\r\nformed the tally of those who knew the personality of elizabeth during\r\nboth periods of her youth that up to  and that which followed\r\nhenry viii manifestly not only had no doubt on the subject but no\r\nthought if he had had he was just the man to have settled it at once\r\nanne boleyn was dead so was her predecessor in title anne of cleves\r\nhad accepted the annulment of her marriageand a pension jane seymour\r\nand catherine howard were both dead nearly all those who as nurses\r\ngovernesses or teachers lady bryan richard croke william grindal\r\nroger ascham who knew the first period were dead or had retired into\r\nother spheres those who remained knowing well the individuality of the\r\nprincess and representing both periods were mrs ashley thomas parry\r\nand the queen later dowager catherine parr\r\n\r\nwe know already of the faithfulness of the two former the man who\r\nwas a clever as well as a faithful servant and the woman who having\r\nno children of her own took to her heart the little child entrusted\r\nto her care and treated her with such affectionate staunchnessa\r\nstaunchness which has caused more than one historian to suspect that\r\nthere was some grave secret between them which linked their fortunes\r\ntogether\r\n\r\nas to catherine parr we are able to judge from her letters that she was\r\nfond of her stepdaughter and was consistently kind to her those who\r\nchoose to study the matter further can form an opinion of their own\r\nfrom certain recorded episodes which given without any elucidating\r\npossibilities leave the historians in further doubt leti puts in\r\nhis life under the date of  before her marriage to henry\r\ncatherine parr had seen often elizabeth and admired her the italian\r\nhistorian may have had some authority for the statement but also\r\nit may have been taken from some statement made by elizabeth in later\r\nyears or by some person in her interest to create a misleading belief\r\nin any case let us accept the statement as a matter of fact if so\r\nit may throw a light on another branch of this eternal and diverse\r\nmystery martin hume and f a mumby approaching the subject from\r\ndifferent points confess themselves puzzled by elizabeths attitude to\r\nmen the former writes in his courtships of queen elizabeth\r\n\r\n    no one can look at the best portraits of elizabeth without\r\n    recognising at a glance that she was not a sensual woman the\r\n    lean austere face the tight thin lips the pointed delicate\r\n    chin the cold dull eyes tell of a character the very opposite\r\n    of lascivious\r\n\r\nmr mumby writing about mrs ashleys confession and of the\r\nhorseplay between elizabeth and lord seymour whom queen catherine had\r\nmarried immediately after the kings death makes this remark\r\n\r\n    the most surprising thing about this behaviour is that the queen\r\n    should have encouraged it\r\n\r\nthere is plenty of room for wonder considering that admiral seymour\r\nhad earlier wanted to marry elizabeth but catherine was a clever\r\nwoman who had already had three husbandsseymour was her fourthand\r\nchildren if any one would see through a boys disguise as a girl\r\nshe was the one it is hard to imagine that seymours wife had not\r\ngood cause for some form revenge on him of whom hallam speaks of as a\r\ndangerous and unprincipled man and of whom latimer said he was a man\r\nfarthest from the fear of god that ever i knew or heard of in england\r\nas it was believed at the time of her death that he had poisoned his\r\nwife the queen dowager to make way for a marriage with elizabeth\r\nwith whom according to common belief he was still in love it would\r\nbe only natural that a woman of her disposition and with her sense\r\nof humour should revenge herself in a truly wifely way by using for\r\nthe purpose without betraying the secret her private knowledge or\r\nbelief of the quasiprincesss real sex such would afford an infinite\r\ngratification to an illused wife jealous of so vain a husband\r\n\r\nillustration the duke of richmond\r\n\r\nwe now come to the crux of the whole storythe touchstone of this\r\nstrange eventful history could there have been such a boy as is told\r\nof one answering to the many conditions above shown to be vitally\r\nnecessary for the carrying out of such a scheme of imposture the\r\nanswer to this question is distinctly in the affirmative there could\r\nhave been such a boy had the duke of richmond been born fourteen or\r\nfifteen years earlier than he was the difficulties of appearance\r\nintellect education and other qualifications need not have presented\r\nthemselves\r\n\r\nif the question to be asked is was there such a boy the\r\nanswer cannot be so readily given in the meantime there are some\r\nconsiderations from the study of whichor through whichan answer\r\nmay later be derived\r\n\r\n\r\nh the solution\r\n\r\nthe duke of richmond\r\n\r\nthe points which must be settled before we can solve the mystery of the\r\nbisley boy are\r\n\r\n was there such an episode regarding the early life of the princess\r\nelizabeth\r\n\r\n was there such a boy as was spoken of\r\n\r\n how could such an imposture have been carried out implying as it\r\ndid\r\n\r\na a likeness to the princess so extraordinary as not to have created\r\nsuspicion in the mind of anyone not already in the plot\r\n\r\nb an acquaintance with the circumstances of the life of the princess\r\nsufficiently accurate to ward off incipient suspicion caused by any\r\noverlooking or neglect of necessary conditions\r\n\r\nc an amount of education and knowledge equal to that held by a child\r\nof ten to twelve years of age who had been taught by some of the most\r\nlearned persons of the time\r\n\r\nd a skill in classics and foreign tongues only known amongst high\r\nscholars and diplomatists\r\n\r\ne an ease of body and a courtliness of manner and bearing utterly\r\nforeign to any not bred in the higher circles of social life\r\n\r\nif there could be found a boy answering such conditionsone whose\r\nassistance could be had with facility and safetythen the solution is\r\npossible even if not susceptible of the fullest proof following the\r\nlines of argument hitherto used in this book let us first consider\r\nreasons why such an argument is tenable i may then perhaps be allowed\r\nto launch the theory which has come to me during this investigation\r\n\r\n\r\na his birth and appearance\r\n\r\na partand no small partof the bitterness of henry viii in not\r\nhaving a son to succeed him was that though he had a son such could\r\nnot by the existing law succeed him on the throne\r\n\r\nnearly ten years after his marriage to catherine of aragon and after\r\na son and other children had been born to them all of whom had died\r\nshortly after birth henry had in the manner of mediæval kingsand\r\nothersentered on a love affair the object of his illicit affection\r\nbeing one of the ladiesinwaiting to queen catherine elizabeth\r\ndaughter of john blount of knevet shropshire\r\n\r\nthe story of this love affair is thus given in quaint old english in\r\ngraftons chronicle first published in  which covers the period\r\nfrom  to \r\n\r\n    you shall understande the king in his freshe youth was in the\r\n    cheynes of love with a faire damosell called elizabeth blunt\r\n    daughter of syr john blunt knight which damosell in synging\r\n    daunsing and in all goodly pastimes excelled all other by the\r\n    which goodly pastimes she wanne the kings hart and she againe\r\n    shewed him such favour that by him she bare a goodly man childe\r\n    of beautie like to the father and mother this child was well\r\n    brought up lyke a princes childe\r\n\r\n\r\nb his upbringing and marriage\r\n\r\nthis son of an unlawful unionborn in  it is saidwas called\r\nhenry fitzroy after the custom applicable in such cases to the natural\r\nchildren of kings naturally enough his royal father took the greatest\r\ninterest in this child and did whilst the latter lived all in his\r\npower to further his interests a mere list of the honours conferred on\r\nhim during his short life will afford some clue to the kings intention\r\nof his further advancement should occasion serve the shower of\r\nfavours began in  when the child as is said was only six years of\r\nage on the th of june of this year he was created earl of nottingham\r\nand duke of richmond and somerset with precedence over all dukes\r\nexcept those of the kings lawful issue he was also made a knight of\r\nthe garterof which exalted order he was raised to the lieutenancy\r\neight years later he was also nominated to other high offices the\r\nkings lieutenant general for districts north of the trent and keeper\r\nof the city and fortress of carlisle to these posts were added those\r\nof lord high admiral of england wales ireland normandy gascony and\r\naquitaine warden general of the marches of scotland and receiver\r\nof middleham and of sheriff hutton yorkshire he was also given an\r\nincome of four thousand pounds sterling per annum in  being then\r\nonly ten years of age he was also made lord lieutenant of ireland\r\nconstable of dover castle and warden of the cinque portsthree of the\r\nmost important offices of the nation a few months before his death\r\nin  there was a general understanding that henry viii intended to\r\nmake him king of ireland and possibly to nominate him as his successor\r\non the throne of england that some such intention was in henrys mind\r\nwas shown by the succession act passed just before the close of the\r\nparliament which was dissolved in  in this act it is fixed that\r\nthe crown is to devolve on the kings death to the son of jane seymour\r\nand in default of issue by him on mary and elizabeth in succession\r\nin case of lack of issue by the former in the event of their both\r\ndying before the king and without issue he is to appoint by will his\r\nsuccessor on the throne\r\n\r\nthe various important posts conferred on the young duke of richmond\r\nwere evidently preparations for the highest post of all which in\r\ndefault of legitimate issue of his own legitimate children he intended\r\nto confer on him\r\n\r\nthe education which was given to the little duke is of especial\r\ninterest and ought in the present connection to be carefully studied\r\nit was under the care of richard croke celebrated for his scholarship\r\nwho in the modern branch was assisted by john palsgrave the author of\r\nthe earliest english grammar of the french language lesclarcissement\r\nde la langue francoyse in spite of the opposition of his household\r\nthe duke of richmond devoted his young life to study rather than to\r\narms whilst still a young boy he had already read a part of cæsar\r\nvirgil and terence knew a little greek and was fairly skilful\r\nin musicsinging and playing on the virginals there was much talk\r\nin court circles as to whom he should marry and many ladies of high\r\ndegree were named one was a niece of pope clement vii another was a\r\ndanish princess still another a princess of france also a daughter of\r\neleanor dowager queen of portugal a sister of charles v this lady\r\nwas afterwards queen of france\r\n\r\nearly in  the duke resided for a while at hatfield then he went to\r\nparis with his friend the earl of surrey son of the duke of norfolk\r\nthere he remained till september  on his return to england he\r\nmarried by special dispensation on  november  mary howard\r\ndaughter of the duke of norfolk by his second marriage and sister of\r\nsurrey incidentally he is said to have been present at the beheading\r\nof queen anne boleyn may   he did not long survive the\r\nlastnamed exhibition for some two months later july  he\r\ndied there was at the time a suspicion that he had been poisoned by\r\nlord rochford brother of queen anne boleyn\r\n\r\nhenry duke of richmond and somerset had no legal issue as a matter\r\nof fact though he was married in  nearly three years before his\r\ndeath he never lived with his wife it was said that he was not only\r\nyoung for matrimony being only seventeen but was in very bad health\r\nit was intended that after his marriage he should go to ireland but on\r\naccount of the state of his health that journey was postponedas it\r\nturned out for ever\r\n\r\na light on this illstarred marriage is thrown in the quaint words of\r\nanother chronicler of the time charles wriothesley who wrote of the\r\ntime between  and \r\n\r\n    but the said younge duke had never layne by his wife and so she\r\n    is maide wife and now a widowe i praie god send her now good\r\n    fortune\r\n\r\nin this summarised history certain points are to be noticed\r\n\r\n the duke of richmond was like his father henry viii and his\r\nmother who was fayre\r\n\r\n a dispensation was obtained for his marriage to lady mary howard\r\nwhich took place in  but with whom he never cohabited\r\n\r\nthere is a sidelight here of the hereditary aspect of the case both\r\nthe duke and duchess of richmond were fayre and in the language of\r\nthe old chroniclers fayre means blonde wintown for instance speaking\r\nof macbeths supposed descent from the devil says\r\n\r\n    gottyne he was on ferly wys\r\n    hys modyr to woddis mad oft repayre\r\n    for the delyte of halesum ayre\r\n    swa scho past apon a day\r\n    tyl a wod hyr for to play\r\n    scho met at cas with a fayr man\r\n\r\nand grafton thus speaks under date  september  of elizabeths\r\nbirth the queen was delivered of a fayre lady\r\n\r\nnow anne boleyn is described as small and lively a brunette with black\r\nhair and beautiful eyes and yet her daughter is given as redhaired by\r\nall the painters\r\n\r\nit is somewhat difficult to make out the true colours of persons for\r\ninstance giovanni michiel writing to the venetian senate in  puts\r\nin his description of elizabeth she is tall and well formed with a\r\ngood skin although swarthy but in the same page he says she prides\r\nherself on her father and glories in him everybody is saying that\r\nshe also resembles him more than the queen mary does as to the\r\nintroduction of the word swarthy as above it may have been one of\r\nthe tricks of elizabeth to keep the venetian ambassador from knowing\r\ntoo much or getting any ground for guessing if so it looks rather like\r\nelizabeth concealing her real identitywhich would be an argument in\r\nfavour of an imposture if she was the real princess there would be no\r\nneed for concealment\r\n\r\nit is only common sense to expect if the paternal element was so\r\nstrong in henry as to reproduce in offspring his own colour that had\r\nthe duke of richmond had any issue especially by a fair wife it too\r\nwould have inherited something of the family colour holbeins picture\r\nof the lady of richmond as the dukes wife was called shows her as\r\na fair woman\r\n\r\nthese are two points to be here borne in mind that henry viii was\r\nprobably bald for in none of his pictures is any hair visible it\r\nwould hardly be polite to infer that elizabeth wore a wig for the same\r\nreason but it is recorded that she always travelled with a stock of\r\nthemno less than eighty of various colours\r\n\r\nbut there are other indications of such concealment why for instance\r\ndid she object to see doctors so long as she was free and could\r\ncontrol them she did not mind but whilst she was under duress they\r\nwere a source of danger perhaps it is this which accounts for her\r\ntaking the sacrament on  august  when she was practically a\r\nprisoner at woodstock in the keeping of sir henry bedingfield about\r\nthe third week in june the princess asked sir henry to be allowed to\r\nhave a doctor sent to her he in turn applied to the council who made\r\nanswer on the th that the queens oxford physician was ill and mr\r\nwendy was absent and the remaining one mr owen could not be spared\r\nthe latter however recommended two oxford doctors barnes and walbec\r\nin case she should care to see either of them on july th sir henry\r\nreported to the council that elizabeth in politely declining said i\r\nam not minded to make any stranger privy to the state of my body but\r\ncommit it to god then when through her submission to the queens\r\nreligious convictions she had obtained her liberty she took no more\r\nconcern in the matter\r\n\r\n\r\nthe duchess of richmond\r\n\r\nthomas howard duke of norfolk married twice his second wife was the\r\nlady elizabeth stafford eldest daughter of the duke of buckingham and\r\nhe had issue by both marriages in  the only surviving daughter of\r\nthe second marriage was mary who was thus the lady mary howard sister\r\nof the earl of surrey it was this lady with whom the uncompleted\r\nmarriage of the duke of richmond took place doubtless they were early\r\nfriends in her youth she used to spend the summer at tendring hall\r\nsuffolk and the winter at hunsdon hertfordshire where was one of\r\nhenrys palaces in addition henry was one of the closest companions of\r\nher brother the earl of surrey lady richmonds part in the historical\r\nepisode before us is hardly direct it only comes in through two\r\ncircumstances not unattended with mystery it is not necessary that\r\nthe two were correlated but no student can get away from the idea\r\nthat there was some connection between them especially when there is\r\nanother inference bearing on the subject with reference to the second\r\nmarriage of the duchess this took place after an interval of some\r\nyears to gilbert son of sir george talboys of goloths lincolnshire\r\nthe name of the second husband is variously spelled in the chronicles\r\nas tailboise or talebuse she died in the year before elizabeth came\r\nto the throne the two things to examine closely with regard to\r\nthis marriage to the duke of richmond were the dispensation for the\r\nmarriage together with the date of it and its nonfulfilment the\r\ndispensation was dated  november  but the marriage took place\r\nthree days earlier whether this discrepancy had anything to do with\r\nher later marriage to talboys we can only guessunless of course more\r\nexhaustive search can produce some document unknown as yet which may\r\nthrow light on the subject it is a matter of no light mystery why a\r\ndispensation was obtained at such a time and by whom it was effected\r\nat this time henry viii was engaged in the bitterest struggle of his\r\nlife that regarding the supremacy of the pope so that it was a direct\r\nviolation of his policy to have asked for or even to recognise such a\r\ndispensation in the case of his own son whom he intended to succeed him\r\nas king before a year had passed he had actually thrown over the papal\r\nauthority altogether and had taken into his own hands the headship\r\nof the national church what then was behind such a maladroit action\r\nif it had been done as a piece of statecraftthe ostensible showing\r\nthat there was as yet no direct rupture between the british nation and\r\nthe papacyit would have lost its efficacy if it might be cited as\r\na court favour rather than a national right moreover as it was to\r\nsanction by then existing canonical law a marriage of henrys son with\r\na daughter of the head of the most powerful catholic house in england\r\nit could not be expected that rome would not use this in its strife for\r\nthe continuation of its supremacy if henry was directly concerned in\r\nthe matter it was bad policy and unlike him to conciliate catholicism\r\nby a yielding on the part of one who would be in the future the head\r\nof the reformed church altogether it leaves one under the impression\r\nthat there must have been a more personal cause than any yet spoken of\r\nsomething to be covered up or from which suspicion should be averted\r\nthere was already quite enough material for a controversy in case henry\r\nfitzroy should come to the throne and it might be well to minimise\r\nany further risk but in such case what was there to be covered up or\r\nfrom which suspicion should be averted already richmond held under\r\nhis father all the threads of government in his own hand if he ever\r\nshould need to tighten them it would be done by himself as ruler there\r\nmust still be some reason which must be kept secret and of which henry\r\nhimself did not and must not know beyond this again was the question\r\nof the personal ambition of bluff king hal it was not sufficient\r\nfor him that a barren heir should succeed himeven if that heir was\r\nhis own son he wanted to found a dynasty and if he suspected for\r\nan instant that after all his plotting and strivingall his titanic\r\nefforts to overcome such obstacles as nations and religionshis hopes\r\nmight fail through lack of issue on his sons part he would cease to\r\nwaste his time and efforts on his behalf it is almost impossible to\r\nimagine that the duke of richmond had not had some love affairsif\r\nindeed he was only seventeen of which there is a doubtit must be\r\nborne in mind that both the lancastrians and the yorkists who united\r\nin the tudor stock matured early on both his fathers and mothers\r\nside henry fitzroy was of a pleasureloving voluptuous nature and\r\nas the masculine element predominated in his makeup there is not any\r\ngreat stretch of imagination required to be satisfied that there was\r\nsome young likeness of him toddling or running about but in a case\r\nlike his masculine misdoing does not count it is only where a womans\r\ncredit is at stake that secrecy is a vital necessity we must therefore\r\nlook to the female side to find a cause for any mystery which there\r\nmay be so far as a boy of the right age is concerned with a decided\r\nlikeness to henry viii it would not have required much searching about\r\nto lay hands on a suitable one\r\n\r\nillustration\r\n\r\n    the lady of richmond\r\n\r\nthe duchess of richmond\r\n\r\nbut here a new trouble would begin it would be beyond nature to expect\r\nthat any mother would consent especially at a moments notice to\r\nher child running such a risk as the substitute of the dead princess\r\nelizabeth was taking without some kind of assurance or guarantee of\r\nhis safety moreover if there were other relatives they would be sure\r\nto know and some of them to make trouble unless their mouths were\r\nclosed practically the only chance of carrying such an enterprise\r\nthrough would be if the substitute were an orphan or in a worse\r\npositionone whose very life was an embarrassment to those to whom it\r\nshould be most dear\r\n\r\nhere opens a field for romantic speculation such need not clash with\r\nhistory which is a record of fact call it romance if we will indeed\r\nuntil we have more perfect records we must if invention is to be\r\ncalled in to the aid of deduction no one can complain if these two\r\nmethods of exercise of intellect are kept apart and the boundaries\r\nbetween them are duly charted any speculation beyond this can be only\r\nregarded as belonging to the region of pure fiction\r\n\r\nin one way there is a duty which the reader must not shirk if\r\nonly on his own account not to refuse to accept facts without due\r\nconsideration wildly improbable as the bisley story is it is not\r\nimpossible whoever says offhand that such a story is untrue on the\r\nface of it ought to study the account of a death reported at colchester\r\nin essex just a hundred years ago a servant died who had been in\r\nthe same situation as housemaid and nurse for thirty years but only\r\nafter death was the true sex of the apparent woman discovered it was\r\nmasculine\r\n\r\n                                   \r\n\r\nhere i must remind such readers as honour my work with their attention\r\nthat i am venturing merely to tell a tradition sanctioned by long time\r\nand that i only give as comments historical facts which may be tested\r\nby any student i have invented and shall invent nothing and only\r\nclaim the same right which i have in common with every one elsethat\r\nof forming my own opinion\r\n\r\nhere it is that we may consider certain additions to the original\r\nbisley tradition how these are connected with the main story is\r\nimpossible to say after the lapse of centuries but in all probability\r\nthere is a basis of ancient belief in all that has been added the\r\nfollowing items cover the additional ground\r\n\r\nwhen the governess wished to hide the secret hurriedly she hid the\r\nbody intending it to be only temporarily in the stone coffin which\r\nlay in the garden at overcourt outside the princesss window\r\n\r\nsome tens of years ago the bones of a young girl lying amidst rags of\r\nfine clothing were found in the stone coffin\r\n\r\nthe finder was a churchmana man of the highest character and a member\r\nof a celebrated ecclesiastical family\r\n\r\nthe said finder firmly believed in the story of the bisley boy\r\n\r\nbefore elizabeth came to the throne all those who knew the secret of\r\nthe substitution were in some way got rid of or their silence assured\r\n\r\nthe name of the substituted youth was neville or such was the name of\r\nthe family with whom he was living at the time\r\n\r\nthere are several persons in the neighbourhood of bisley who accept the\r\ngeneral truth of the story even if some of the minor details appear at\r\nfirst glance to be inharmonious these persons are not of the ordinary\r\nclass of gossipers but men and women of light and leading who have\r\nfixed places in the great world and in the social life of their own\r\nneighbourhood with some of them the truth of the story is an old\r\nbelief which makes a tie with any new investigator\r\n\r\n\r\nthe unfulfilled marriage\r\n\r\nthe remaining point to touch on is the unfulfilled marriage of the duke\r\nof richmond this certainly needs some explanation or else the mystery\r\nremains dark as ever\r\n\r\nhere we have two young persons of more than fair presence and graced\r\nwith all the endearing qualities that the mind as well as the eye can\r\ngrasp we have the assurance of chronicles regarding henry fitzroy\r\nand from holbeins picture we can judge for ourselves of the ladys\r\nmerits they are both welltodo the lady one of title daughter of\r\none of the most prominent dukes in england the man then holding many\r\nof the most important posts in the state and with every expectation of\r\nwearing in due course the purple of royalty they both come of families\r\nof which other members have been notorious for amatory episodes\r\nvoluptuousness is in their blood they have been old friendsand yet\r\nwhen they marry they at once separate she going to her own folk and\r\nhe to windsor seemingly they do not meet again in the two and a half\r\nyears that elapse before his death the story about his youth and\r\nhealth preventing cohabitation is all moonshine the affair points to\r\nthe likelihood of some antematrimonial liaison of which as yet we\r\nknow nothing applying the experiences of ordinary life in such cases\r\nwe can easily believe that mary howard egged on by her unscrupulous\r\nand ambitiouslyintriguing brother was for ulterior purposes either\r\nforced or helped into an intrigue with the young duke there is no\r\ndoubt that surrey was unscrupulous enough for it a similar design on\r\nhis partonly infinitely more basecost him his head he had tried\r\nto induce his sister duchess of richmond to become mistress of henry\r\nviiiher own fatherinlawso that she might have power over him\r\nand it does not seem that there was any wonderful indignation on the\r\npart of the lady at the shameful proposal\r\n\r\nwe are told that when sir john gates and sir richard southwell the\r\nroyal commissioners for examining witnesses in the case of the charge\r\nof treason against the duke of norfolk and the earl of surrey arrived\r\nat kenninghall in the early morning and made known their general\r\npurposes in coming the duchess of richmond almost fainted but all\r\nthe same when she knew more exactly what they wanted she promised\r\nwithout any forcing to tell all she knew as a matter of fact her\r\nevidence with that of elizabeth holland the mistress of the duke of\r\nnorfolk whilst it helped to get norfolk off aided in condemning\r\nsurrey there must have been some other cause for her consternation\r\nshe had been bred up in the midst of intrigues polemical and dynastic\r\nas well as of personal ambition and was well inured to keeping her\r\ncountenance as well as her head in moments of stress the cause of her\r\nalmost fainting must have been something which concerned her even\r\nmore nearly than either father or brother it could only have been fear\r\nfor her child or herselfor for both it is possible that she dreaded\r\ndiscovery of some sort omne ignotum pro magnifico suspicion has\r\nlong flexible tentacula with eyes and ears at the end of them which\r\ncan penetrate everywhere and see and hear everything she knew how to\r\ndread suspicion and to fear the consequences which must result from\r\ninquiry or investigation of any sort if she had had a child it must\r\nhave been kept hidden and if possible far awayas the unknown boy\r\nwas at bisley indeed the howards had immense family ramifications and\r\nseveral of them had collateral relationships in and about bisley there\r\nwere nevilles there and doubtless some of them were poor relations\r\nrelegated to the far away place where living was cheap and where they\r\nmight augment their tenuous incomes by taking in even poorer relations\r\nthan themselves whose rich relatives wished to hide them away it is\r\nonly a surmise but if there had been a case of a child unaccounted\r\nfor which any member of so great a family as the howards wished to\r\nkeep dark it would be hard to find a more favourable locality than\r\nthe little almost inaccessible hamlet in the cotswolds if there were\r\nsuch a child how easy it would all have been when the duke was\r\nmarried he was fourteen or perhaps sixteen at mostan age which\r\nthough overyoung for fatherhood in the case of ordinary men seemed to\r\noffer to the plantagenetyorklancaster blood no absolute difficulty\r\nof taking up such responsibility as elizabeth was only born some two\r\nmonths before the dukes marriage there was not any time to sparea\r\nfact which would doubtless have been used to his advantage if henrys\r\nnatural son had lived in all probability richmonds marriage was a\r\npart of the plot for aggrandisement of the howards which began with the\r\nunscrupulous securing by surrey of the son of henry viii at the cost of\r\nhis sisters honour and ended with the death of surrey as a traitora\r\ndoom which his father only escaped by the king dying whilst the act\r\nof attainder was lying ready for his signature if this reasoning be\r\ncorrectthough the data on which it is founded be meagre and without\r\nactual proofas yetthe risk of duchess marys child born before\r\nher marriage must have been a terrible hazard on one side perhaps\r\nthe most powerful sceptre in the world as guerdon on the other death\r\nand ruin of the child on which such hopes were built no wonder then\r\nthat duchess mary almost fainted when in the early dawn the kings\r\ncommissioners conveyed to her the broad object of their coming no\r\nwonder that freed by larger knowledge from the worst apprehension which\r\ncould be for her she announced her willingness to conceal nothing\r\nthat she knew that promise could not and would not have been made\r\nhad the whole range of possibilities which as yet no one suspected\r\nbeen opened to their investigation for even beyond the concern which\r\nshe felt from the arbitrary power of the king and at the remorseless\r\ngrip of the law she had reason to doubt her own kinthe nearest of\r\nthemin such a struggle as was going on around them when the whole of\r\nthe empire the kingdom of england france and spain and the papacy\r\nwere close to the meltingpot it would have been but a poor lookout\r\nfor a youth of a little more than a dozen years of age had fate made\r\nhim the shuttlecock of such strenuous players who did not hold fair\r\nplay as a primary rule of the game in which they were engaged\r\n\r\nin his life of elizabeth gregario leti concludes a panegyric on the\r\nqueens beauty with the following this was accompanied by such inward\r\nqualities that those who knew her were accustomed to say that heaven\r\nhad given her such rare qualities that she was doubtless reserved for\r\nsome great work in the world the italian historian perhaps builded\r\nbetter than he knew for whether the phrase applies to the one who
