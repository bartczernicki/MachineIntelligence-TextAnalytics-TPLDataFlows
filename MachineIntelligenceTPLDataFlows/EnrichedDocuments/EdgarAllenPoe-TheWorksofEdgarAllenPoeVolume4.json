Yet as it lies some distance from any of the\r\n      main roads, being in a somewhat out-of-the-way situation, there\r\n      are perhaps very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit.\r\n      For the benefit of those who have not, therefore, it will be only\r\n      proper that I should enter into some account of it. And this is\r\n      indeed the more necessary, as with the hope of enlisting public\r\n      sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants, I design here to give a\r\n      history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred\r\n      within its limits. No one who knows me will doubt that the duty\r\n      thus self-imposed will be executed to the best of my ability,\r\n      with all that rigid impartiality, all that cautious examination\r\n      into facts, and diligent collation of authorities, which should\r\n      ever distinguish him who aspires to the title of historian.\r\n\r\n      By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscriptions, I am\r\n      enabled to say, positively, that the borough of\r\n      Vondervotteimittiss has existed, from its origin, in precisely\r\n      the same condition which it at present preserves. Of the date of\r\n      this origin, however, I grieve that I can only speak with that\r\n      species of indefinite definiteness which mathematicians are, at\r\n      times, forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae. The\r\n      date, I may thus say, in regard to the remoteness of its\r\n      antiquity, cannot be less than any assignable quantity\r\n      whatsoever.\r\n\r\n      Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittiss, I\r\n      confess myself, with sorrow, equally at fault. Among a multitude\r\n      of opinions upon this delicate point—some acute, some learned,\r\n      some sufficiently the reverse—I am able to select nothing which\r\n      ought to be considered satisfactory. Perhaps the idea of\r\n      Grogswigg—nearly coincident with that of Kroutaplenttey—is to be\r\n      cautiously preferred.—It runs:—“Vondervotteimittis—Vonder, lege\r\n      Donder—Votteimittis, quasi und Bleitziz—Bleitziz obsol:—pro\r\n      Blitzen.” This derivative, to say the truth, is still\r\n      countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the\r\n      summit of the steeple of the House of the Town-Council. I do not\r\n      choose, however, to commit myself on a theme of such importance,\r\n      and must refer the reader desirous of information to the\r\n      “Oratiunculae de Rebus Praeter-Veteris,” of Dundergutz. See,\r\n      also, Blunderbuzzard “De Derivationibus,” pp. 27 to 5010, Folio,\r\n      Gothic edit., Red and Black character, Catch-word and No Cypher;\r\n      wherein consult, also, marginal notes in the autograph of\r\n      Stuffundpuff, with the Sub-Commentaries of Gruntundguzzell.\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the\r\n      foundation of Vondervotteimittis, and the derivation of its name,\r\n      there can be no doubt, as I said before, that it has always\r\n      existed as we find it at this epoch. The oldest man in the\r\n      borough can remember not the slightest difference in the\r\n      appearance of any portion of it; and, indeed, the very suggestion\r\n      of such a possibility is considered an insult. The site of the\r\n      village is in a perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of a\r\n      mile in circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills,\r\n      over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass. For\r\n      this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe\r\n      there is anything at all on the other side.\r\n\r\n      Round the skirts of the valley (which is quite level, and paved\r\n      throughout with flat tiles), extends a continuous row of sixty\r\n      little houses. These, having their backs on the hills, must look,\r\n      of course, to the centre of the plain, which is just sixty yards\r\n      from the front door of each dwelling. Every house has a small\r\n      garden before it, with a circular path, a sun-dial, and\r\n      twenty-four cabbages. The buildings themselves are so precisely\r\n      alike, that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other.\r\n      Owing to the vast antiquity, the style of architecture is\r\n      somewhat odd, but it is not for that reason the less strikingly\r\n      picturesque. They are fashioned of hard-burned little bricks,\r\n      red, with black ends, so that the walls look like a chess-board\r\n      upon a great scale. The gables are turned to the front, and there\r\n      are cornices, as big as all the rest of the house, over the eaves\r\n      and over the main doors. The windows are narrow and deep, with\r\n      very tiny panes and a great deal of sash. On the roof is a vast\r\n      quantity of tiles with long curly ears. The woodwork, throughout,\r\n      is of a dark hue and there is much carving about it, with but a\r\n      trifling variety of pattern for, time out of mind, the carvers of\r\n      Vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two\r\n      objects—a time-piece and a cabbage. But these they do exceedingly\r\n      well, and intersperse them, with singular ingenuity, wherever\r\n      they find room for the chisel.\r\n\r\n      The dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the furniture\r\n      is all upon one plan. The floors are of square tiles, the chairs\r\n      and tables of black-looking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy\r\n      feet. The mantelpieces are wide and high, and have not only\r\n      time-pieces and cabbages sculptured over the front, but a real\r\n      time-piece, which makes a prodigious ticking, on the top in the\r\n      middle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on each\r\n      extremity by way of outrider. Between each cabbage and the\r\n      time-piece, again, is a little China man having a large stomach\r\n      with a great round hole in it, through which is seen the\r\n      dial-plate of a watch.\r\n\r\n      The fireplaces are large and deep, with fierce crooked-looking\r\n      fire-dogs. There is constantly a rousing fire, and a huge pot\r\n      over it, full of sauer-kraut and pork, to which the good woman of\r\n      the house is always busy in attending. She is a little fat old\r\n      lady, with blue eyes and a red face, and wears a huge cap like a\r\n      sugar-loaf, ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons. Her dress\r\n      is of orange-colored linsey-woolsey, made very full behind and\r\n      very short in the waist—and indeed very short in other respects,\r\n      not reaching below the middle of her leg. This is somewhat thick,\r\n      and so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair of green stockings\r\n      to cover them. Her shoes—of pink leather—are fastened each with a\r\n      bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage. In\r\n      her left hand she has a little heavy Dutch watch; in her right\r\n      she wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork. By her side there\r\n      stands a fat tabby cat, with a gilt toy-repeater tied to its\r\n      tail, which “the boys” have there fastened by way of a quiz.\r\n\r\n      The boys themselves are, all three of them, in the garden\r\n      attending the pig. They are each two feet in height. They have\r\n      three-cornered cocked hats, purple waistcoats reaching down to\r\n      their thighs, buckskin knee-breeches, red stockings, heavy shoes\r\n      with big silver buckles, long surtout coats with large buttons of\r\n      mother-of-pearl. Each, too, has a pipe in his mouth, and a little\r\n      dumpy watch in his right hand. He takes a puff and a look, and\r\n      then a look and a puff. The pig—which is corpulent and lazy—is\r\n      occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the\r\n      cabbages, and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater,\r\n      which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him\r\n      look as handsome as the cat.\r\n\r\n      Right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bottomed armed\r\n      chair, with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables, is\r\n      seated the old man of the house himself. He is an exceedingly\r\n      puffy little old gentleman, with big circular eyes and a huge\r\n      double chin. His dress resembles that of the boys—and I need say\r\n      nothing farther about it. All the difference is, that his pipe is\r\n      somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke. Like\r\n      them, he has a watch, but he carries his watch in his pocket. To\r\n      say the truth, he has something of more importance than a watch\r\n      to attend to—and what that is, I shall presently explain. He sits\r\n      with his right leg upon his left knee, wears a grave countenance,\r\n      and always keeps one of his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon\r\n      a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain.\r\n\r\n      This object is situated in the steeple of the House of the Town\r\n      Council. The Town Council are all very little, round, oily,\r\n      intelligent men, with big saucer eyes and fat double chins, and\r\n      have their coats much longer and their shoe-buckles much bigger\r\n      than the ordinary inhabitants of Vondervotteimittiss. Since my\r\n      sojourn in the borough, they have had several special meetings,\r\n      and have adopted these three important resolutions:\r\n\r\n      “That it is wrong to alter the good old course of things:”\r\n\r\n      “That there is nothing tolerable out of Vondervotteimittiss:”\r\n      and—\r\n\r\n      “That we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages.”\r\n\r\n      Above the session-room of the Council is the steeple, and in the\r\n      steeple is the belfry, where exists, and has existed time out of\r\n      mind, the pride and wonder of the village—the great clock of the\r\n      borough of Vondervotteimittiss. And this is the object to which\r\n      the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the\r\n      leather-bottomed arm-chairs.\r\n\r\n      The great clock has seven faces—one in each of the seven sides of\r\n      the steeple—so that it can be readily seen from all quarters. Its\r\n      faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black. There\r\n      is a belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty\r\n      is the most perfect of sinecures—for the clock of\r\n      Vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the\r\n      matter with it. Until lately, the bare supposition of such a\r\n      thing was considered heretical. From the remotest period of\r\n      antiquity to which the archives have reference, the hours have\r\n      been regularly struck by the big bell. And, indeed the case was\r\n      just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the\r\n      borough. Never was such a place for keeping the true time. When\r\n      the large clapper thought proper to say “Twelve o’clock!” all its\r\n      obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously, and\r\n      responded like a very echo. In short, the good burghers were fond\r\n      of their sauer-kraut, but then they were proud of their clocks.\r\n\r\n      All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less\r\n      respect, and as the belfry—man of Vondervotteimittiss has the\r\n      most perfect of sinecures, he is the most perfectly respected of\r\n      any man in the world. He is the chief dignitary of the borough,\r\n      and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence.\r\n      His coat-tail is very far longer—his pipe, his shoe-buckles, his\r\n      eyes, and his stomach, very far bigger—than those of any other\r\n      old gentleman in the village; and as to his chin, it is not only\r\n      double, but triple.\r\n\r\n      I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteimittiss:\r\n      alas, that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse!\r\n\r\n      There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants, that\r\n      “no good can come from over the hills”; and it really seemed that\r\n      the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy. It\r\n      wanted five minutes of noon, on the day before yesterday, when\r\n      there appeared a very odd-looking object on the summit of the\r\n      ridge of the eastward. Such an occurrence, of course, attracted\r\n      universal attention, and every little old gentleman who sat in a\r\n      leather-bottomed arm-chair turned one of his eyes with a stare of\r\n      dismay upon the phenomenon, still keeping the other upon the\r\n      clock in the steeple.\r\n\r\n      By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon, the droll\r\n      object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive\r\n      foreign-looking young man. He descended the hills at a great\r\n      rate, so that every body had soon a good look at him. He was\r\n      really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen\r\n      in Vondervotteimittiss. His countenance was of a dark\r\n      snuff-color, and he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide\r\n      mouth, and an excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed\r\n      anxious of displaying, as he was grinning from ear to ear. What\r\n      with mustachios and whiskers, there was none of the rest of his\r\n      face to be seen. His head was uncovered, and his hair neatly done\r\n      up in papillotes. His dress was a tight-fitting swallow-tailed\r\n      black coat (from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of\r\n      white handkerchief), black kerseymere knee-breeches, black\r\n      stockings, and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black\r\n      satin ribbon for bows. Under one arm he carried a huge\r\n      _chapeau-de-bras_, and under the other a fiddle nearly five times\r\n      as big as himself. In his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from\r\n      which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of\r\n      fantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the\r\n      greatest possible self-satisfaction. God bless me!—here was a\r\n      sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss!\r\n\r\n      To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an\r\n      audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he curvetted right\r\n      into the village, the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited\r\n      no little suspicion; and many a burgher who beheld him that day\r\n      would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric\r\n      handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his\r\n      swallow-tailed coat. But what mainly occasioned a righteous\r\n      indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he cut a\r\n      fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem to have the\r\n      remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his\r\n      steps.\r\n\r\n      The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance, however, to\r\n      get their eyes thoroughly open, when, just as it wanted half a\r\n      minute of noon, the rascal bounced, as I say, right into the\r\n      midst of them; gave a _chassez_ here, and a _balancez_ there; and\r\n      then, after a _pirouette_ and a _pas-de-zephyr_, pigeon-winged\r\n      himself right up into the belfry of the House of the Town\r\n      Council, where the wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a\r\n      state of dignity and dismay. But the little chap seized him at\r\n      once by the nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big\r\n      _chapeau-de-bras_ upon his head; knocked it down over his eyes\r\n      and mouth; and then, lifting up the big fiddle, beat him with it\r\n      so long and so soundly, that what with the belfry-man being so\r\n      fat, and the fiddle being so hollow, you would have sworn that\r\n      there was a regiment of double-bass drummers all beating the\r\n      devil’s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of\r\n      Vondervotteimittiss.\r\n\r\n      There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this\r\n      unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for\r\n      the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon.\r\n      The bell was about to strike, and it was a matter of absolute and\r\n      pre-eminent necessity that every body should look well at his\r\n      watch. It was evident, however, that just at this moment the\r\n      fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business\r\n      to do with the clock. But as it now began to strike, nobody had\r\n      any time to attend to his manœuvres, for they had all to count\r\n      the strokes of the bell as it sounded.\r\n\r\n      “One!” said the clock.\r\n\r\n      “Von!” echoed every little old gentleman in every\r\n      leather-bottomed arm-chair in Vondervotteimittiss. “Von!” said\r\n      his watch also; “von!” said the watch of his vrow; and “von!”\r\n      said the watches of the boys, and the little gilt repeaters on\r\n      the tails of the cat and pig.\r\n\r\n      “Two!” continued the big bell; and\r\n\r\n      “Doo!” repeated all the repeaters.\r\n\r\n      “Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!” said the bell.\r\n\r\n      “Dree! Vour! Fibe! Sax! Seben! Aight! Noin! Den!” answered the\r\n      others.\r\n\r\n      “Eleven!” said the big one.\r\n\r\n      “Eleben!” assented the little ones.\r\n\r\n      “Twelve!” said the bell.\r\n\r\n      “Dvelf!” they replied perfectly satisfied, and dropping their\r\n      voices.\r\n\r\n      “Und dvelf it is!” said all the little old gentlemen, putting up\r\n      their watches. But the big bell had not done with them yet.\r\n\r\n      “Thirteen!” said he.\r\n\r\n      “Der Teufel!” gasped the little old gentlemen, turning pale,\r\n      dropping their pipes, and putting down all their right legs from\r\n      over their left knees.\r\n\r\n      “Der Teufel!” groaned they, “Dirteen! Dirteen!!—Mein Gott, it is\r\n      Dirteen o’clock!!”\r\n\r\n      Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued? All\r\n      Vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of\r\n      uproar.\r\n\r\n      “Vot is cum’d to mein pelly?” roared all the boys—“I’ve been\r\n      ongry for dis hour!”\r\n\r\n      “Vot is com’d to mein kraut?” screamed all the vrows, “It has\r\n      been done to rags for this hour!”\r\n\r\n      “Vot is cum’d to mein pipe?” swore all the little old gentlemen,\r\n      “Donder and Blitzen; it has been smoked out for dis hour!”—and\r\n      they filled them up again in a great rage, and sinking back in\r\n      their arm-chairs, puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the\r\n      whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke.\r\n\r\n      Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face, and it\r\n      seemed as if old Nick himself had taken possession of every thing\r\n      in the shape of a timepiece. The clocks carved upon the furniture\r\n      took to dancing as if bewitched, while those upon the\r\n      mantel-pieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury, and\r\n      kept such a continual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking\r\n      and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see.\r\n      But, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could put up\r\n      any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to\r\n      their tails, and resented it by scampering all over the place,\r\n      scratching and poking, and squeaking and screeching, and\r\n      caterwauling and squalling, and flying into the faces, and\r\n      running under the petticoats of the people, and creating\r\n      altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is\r\n      possible for a reasonable person to conceive. And to make matters\r\n      still more distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the\r\n      steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost. Every now\r\n      and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the\r\n      smoke. There he sat in the belfry upon the belfry-man, who was\r\n      lying flat upon his back. In his teeth the villain held the\r\n      bell-rope, which he kept jerking about with his head, raising\r\n      such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it. On\r\n      his lap lay the big fiddle, at which he was scraping, out of all\r\n      time and tune, with both hands, making a great show, the\r\n      nincompoop! of playing “Judy O’Flannagan and Paddy O’Rafferty.”\r\n\r\n      Affairs being thus miserably situated, I left the place in\r\n      disgust, and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and\r\n      fine kraut. Let us proceed in a body to the borough, and restore\r\n      the ancient order of things in Vondervotteimittiss by ejecting\r\n      that little fellow from the steeple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIONIZING\r\n\r\n\r\n     —— all people went\r\n     Upon their ten toes in wild wonderment.\r\n                    —_Bishop Hall’s Satires_.\r\n\r\n      I am—that is to say I was—a great man; but I am neither the\r\n      author of Junius nor the man in the mask; for my name, I believe,\r\n      is Robert Jones, and I was born somewhere in the city of\r\n      Fum-Fudge.\r\n\r\n      The first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with\r\n      both hands. My mother saw this and called me a genius—my father\r\n      wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on Nosology. This I\r\n      mastered before I was breeched.\r\n\r\n      I now began to feel my way in the science, and soon came to\r\n      understand that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently\r\n      conspicuous, he might, by merely following it, arrive at a\r\n      Lionship. But my attention was not confined to theories alone.\r\n      Every morning I gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed\r\n      a half dozen of drams.\r\n\r\n      When I came of age my father asked me, one day, if I would step\r\n      with him into his study.\r\n\r\n      “My son,” said he, when we were seated, “what is the chief end of\r\n      your existence?”\r\n\r\n      “My father,” I answered, “it is the study of Nosology.”\r\n\r\n      “And what, Robert,” he inquired, “is Nosology?”\r\n\r\n      “Sir,” I said, “it is the science of Noses.”\r\n\r\n      “And can you tell me,” he demanded, “what is the meaning of a\r\n      nose?”\r\n\r\n      “A nose, my father;” I replied, greatly softened, “has been\r\n      variously defined by about a thousand different authors.” [Here I\r\n      pulled out my watch.] “It is now noon or thereabouts—we shall\r\n      have time enough to get through with them all before midnight. To\r\n      commence then:—The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that\r\n      protuberance—that bump—that excrescence—that—”\r\n\r\n      “Will do, Robert,” interrupted the good old gentleman. “I am\r\n      thunderstruck at the extent of your information—I am\r\n      positively—upon my soul.” [Here he closed his eyes and placed his\r\n      hand upon his heart.] “Come here!” [Here he took me by the arm.]\r\n      “Your education may now be considered as finished—it is high time\r\n      you should scuffle for yourself—and you cannot do a better thing\r\n      than merely follow your nose—so—so—so—” [Here he kicked me\r\n      downstairs and out of the door.]—“so get out of my house, and God\r\n      bless you!”\r\n\r\n      As I felt within me the divine afflatus, I considered this\r\n      accident rather fortunate than otherwise. I resolved to be guided\r\n      by the paternal advice. I determined to follow my nose. I gave it\r\n      a pull or two upon the spot, and wrote a pamphlet on Nosology\r\n      forthwith.\r\n\r\n      All Fum-Fudge was in an uproar.\r\n\r\n      “Wonderful genius!” said the Quarterly.\r\n\r\n      “Superb physiologist!” said the Westminster.\r\n\r\n      “Clever fellow!” said the Foreign.\r\n\r\n      “Fine writer!” said the Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n      “Profound thinker!” said the Dublin.\r\n\r\n      “Great man!” said Bentley.\r\n\r\n      “Divine soul!” said Fraser.\r\n\r\n      “One of us!” said Blackwood.\r\n\r\n      “Who can he be?” said Mrs. Bas-Bleu.\r\n\r\n      “What can he be?” said big Miss Bas-Bleu.\r\n\r\n      “Where can he be?” said little Miss Bas-Bleu.—But I paid these\r\n      people no attention whatever—I just stepped into the shop of an\r\n      artist.\r\n\r\n      The Duchess of Bless-my-Soul was sitting for her portrait; the\r\n      Marquis of So-and-So was holding the Duchess’ poodle; the Earl of\r\n      This-and-That was flirting with her salts; and his Royal Highness\r\n      of Touch-me-Not was leaning upon the back of her chair.\r\n\r\n      I approached the artist and turned up my nose.\r\n\r\n      “Oh, beautiful!” sighed her Grace.\r\n\r\n      “Oh my!” lisped the Marquis.\r\n\r\n      “Oh, shocking!” groaned the Earl.\r\n\r\n      “Oh, abominable!” growled his Royal Highness.\r\n\r\n      “What will you take for it?” asked the artist.\r\n\r\n      “For his nose!” shouted her Grace.\r\n\r\n      “A thousand pounds,” said I, sitting down.\r\n\r\n      “A thousand pounds?” inquired the artist, musingly.\r\n\r\n      “A thousand pounds,” said I.\r\n\r\n      “Beautiful!” said he, entranced.\r\n\r\n      “A thousand pounds,” said I.\r\n\r\n      “Do you warrant it?” he asked, turning the nose to the light.\r\n\r\n      “I do,” said I, blowing it well.\r\n\r\n      “Is it quite original?” he inquired; touching it with reverence.\r\n\r\n      “Humph!” said I, twisting it to one side.\r\n\r\n      “Has no copy been taken?” he demanded, surveying it through a\r\n      microscope.\r\n\r\n      “None,” said I, turning it up.\r\n\r\n      “Admirable!” he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the\r\n      beauty of the manœuvre.\r\n\r\n      “A thousand pounds,” said I.\r\n\r\n      “A thousand pounds?” said he.\r\n\r\n      “Precisely,” said I.\r\n\r\n      “A thousand pounds?” said he.\r\n\r\n      “Just so,” said I.\r\n\r\n      “You shall have them,” said he. “What a piece of virtu!” So he\r\n      drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch of my nose. I\r\n      engaged rooms in Jermyn street, and sent her Majesty the\r\n      ninety-ninth edition of the “Nosology,” with a portrait of the\r\n      proboscis.—That sad little rake, the Prince of Wales, invited me\r\n      to dinner.\r\n\r\n      We were all lions and _recherchés_.\r\n\r\n      There was a modern Platonist. He quoted Porphyry, Iamblicus,\r\n      Plotinus, Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius, and Syrianus.\r\n\r\n      There was a human-perfectibility man. He quoted Turgôt, Price,\r\n      Priestly, Condorcêt, De Staël, and the “Ambitious Student in Ill\r\n      Health.”\r\n\r\n      There was Sir Positive Paradox. He observed that all fools were\r\n      philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools.\r\n\r\n      There was Æstheticus Ethix. He spoke of fire, unity, and atoms;\r\n      bi-part and pre-existent soul; affinity and discord; primitive\r\n      intelligence and homoömeria.\r\n\r\n      There was Theologos Theology. He talked of Eusebius and Arianus;\r\n      heresy and the Council of Nice; Puseyism and consubstantialism;\r\n      Homousios and Homouioisios.\r\n\r\n      There was Fricassée from the Rocher de Cancale. He mentioned\r\n      Muriton of red tongue; cauliflowers with _velouté_ sauce; veal _à\r\n      la St_. Menehoult; marinade _à la_ St. Florentin; and orange\r\n      jellies _en mosaïques_.\r\n\r\n      There was Bibulus O’Bumper. He touched upon Latour and\r\n      Markbrünnen; upon Mousseux and Chambertin; upon Richbourg and St.\r\n      George; upon Haubrion, Leonville, and Medoc; upon Barac and\r\n      Preignac; upon Grâve, upon Sauterne, upon Lafitte, and upon St.\r\n      Peray. He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot, and told, with his\r\n      eyes shut, the difference between Sherry and Amontillado.\r\n\r\n      There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence. He discoursed of\r\n      Cimabué, Arpino, Carpaccio, and Argostino—of the gloom of\r\n      Caravaggio, of the amenity of Albano, of the colors of Titian, of\r\n      the frows of Rubens, and of the waggeries of Jan Steen.\r\n\r\n      There was the President of the Fum-Fudge University. He was of\r\n      opinion that the moon was called Bendis in Thrace, Bubastis in\r\n      Egypt, Dian in Rome, and Artemis in Greece.\r\n\r\n      There was a Grand Turk from Stamboul. He could not help thinking\r\n      that the angels were horses, cocks, and bulls; that somebody in\r\n      the sixth heaven had seventy thousand heads; and that the earth\r\n      was supported by a sky-blue cow with an incalculable number of\r\n      green horns.\r\n\r\n      There was Delphinus Polyglott. He told us what had become of the\r\n      eighty-three lost tragedies of Æschylus; of the fifty-four\r\n      orations of Isæus; of the three hundred and ninety-one speeches\r\n      of Lysias; of the hundred and eighty treatises of Theophrastus;\r\n      of the eighth book of the conic sections of Apollonius; of\r\n      Pindar’s hymns and dithyrambics; and of the five and forty\r\n      tragedies of Homer Junior.\r\n\r\n      There was Ferdinand Fitz-Fossillus Feltspar. He informed us all\r\n      about internal fires and tertiary formations; about aëriforms,\r\n      fluidiforms, and solidiforms; about quartz and marl; about schist\r\n      and schorl; about gypsum and trap; about talc and calc; about\r\n      blende and horn-blende; about mica-slate and pudding-stone; about\r\n      cyanite and lepidolite; about hematite and tremolite; about\r\n      antimony and calcedony; about manganese and whatever you please.\r\n\r\n      There was myself. I spoke of myself;—of myself, of myself, of\r\n      myself;—of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up\r\n      my nose, and I spoke of myself.\r\n\r\n      “Marvellous clever man!” said the Prince.\r\n\r\n      “Superb!” said his guests;—and next morning her Grace of\r\n      Bless-my-Soul paid me a visit.\r\n\r\n      “Will you go to Almack’s, pretty creature?” she said, tapping me\r\n      under the chin.\r\n\r\n      “Upon honor,” said I.\r\n\r\n      “Nose and all?” she asked.\r\n\r\n      “As I live,” I replied.\r\n\r\n      “Here then is a card, my life. Shall I say you will be there?”\r\n\r\n      “Dear Duchess, with all my heart.”\r\n\r\n      “Pshaw, no!—but with all your nose?”\r\n\r\n      “Every bit of it, my love,” said I:—so I gave it a twist or two,\r\n      and found myself at Almack’s. The rooms were crowded to\r\n      suffocation.\r\n\r\n      “He is coming!” said somebody on the staircase.\r\n\r\n      “He is coming!” said somebody farther up.\r\n\r\n      “He is coming!” said somebody farther still.\r\n\r\n      “He is come!” exclaimed the Duchess. “He is come, the little\r\n      love!”—and, seizing me firmly by both hands, she kissed me thrice\r\n      upon the nose. A marked sensation immediately ensued.\r\n\r\n      “_Diavolo!_” cried Count Capricornutti.\r\n\r\n      “_Dios guarda!_” muttered Don Stiletto.\r\n\r\n      “_Mille tonnerres!_” ejaculated the Prince de Grenouille.\r\n\r\n      “_Tousand teufel!_” growled the Elector of Bluddennuff.\r\n\r\n      It was not to be borne. I grew angry. I turned short upon\r\n      Bluddennuff.\r\n\r\n      “Sir!” said I to him, “you are a baboon.”\r\n\r\n      “Sir,” he replied, after a pause, “_Donner und Blitzen!_”\r\n\r\n      This was all that could be desired. We exchanged cards. At\r\n      Chalk-Farm, the next morning, I shot off his nose—and then called\r\n      upon my friends.\r\n\r\n      “_Bête!_” said the first.\r\n\r\n      “Fool!” said the second.\r\n\r\n      “Dolt!” said the third.\r\n\r\n      “Ass!” said the fourth.\r\n\r\n      “Ninny!” said the fifth.\r\n\r\n      “Noodle!” said the sixth.\r\n\r\n      “Be off!” said the seventh.\r\n\r\n      At all this I felt mortified, and so called upon my father.\r\n\r\n      “Father,” I asked, “what is the chief end of my existence?”\r\n\r\n      “My son,” he replied, “it is still the study of Nosology; but in\r\n      hitting the Elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark.\r\n      You have a fine nose, it is true; but then Bluddennuff has none.\r\n      You are damned, and he has become the hero of the day. I grant\r\n      you that in Fum-Fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to\r\n      the size of his proboscis—but, good heavens! there is no\r\n      competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX-ING A PARAGRAB\r\n\r\n\r\n      As it is well known that the ‘wise men’ came ‘from the East,’ and\r\n      as Mr. Touch-and-go Bullet-head came from the East, it follows\r\n      that Mr. Bullet-head was a wise man; and if collateral proof of\r\n      the matter be needed, here we have it—Mr. B. was an editor.\r\n      Irascibility was his sole foible, for in fact the obstinacy of\r\n      which men accused him was anything but his foible, since he\r\n      justly considered it his forte. It was his strong point—his\r\n      virtue; and it would have required all the logic of a Brownson to\r\n      convince him that it was ‘anything else.’\r\n\r\n      I have shown that Touch-and-go Bullet-head was a wise man; and\r\n      the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible, was when,\r\n      abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men, the East, he\r\n      migrated to the city of Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, or some\r\n      place of a similar title, out West.\r\n\r\n      I must do him the justice to say, however, that when he made up\r\n      his mind finally to settle in that town, it was under the\r\n      impression that no newspaper, and consequently no editor, existed\r\n      in that particular section of the country. In establishing ‘The\r\n      Tea-Pot’ he expected to have the field all to himself. I feel\r\n      confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence\r\n      in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis had he been aware that, in\r\n      Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, there lived a gentleman named John\r\n      Smith (if I rightly remember), who for many years had there\r\n      quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the\r\n      ‘Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis Gazette.’ It was solely,\r\n      therefore, on account of having been misinformed, that Mr.\r\n      Bullet-head found himself in Alex—— suppose we call it Nopolis,\r\n      ‘for short’—but, as he did find himself there, he determined to\r\n      keep up his character for obst—for firmness, and remain. So\r\n      remain he did; and he did more; he unpacked his press, type,\r\n      etc., etc., rented an office exactly opposite to that of the\r\n      ‘Gazette,’ and, on the third morning after his arrival, issued\r\n      the first number of ‘The Alexan’—that is to say, of ‘The Nopolis\r\n      Tea-Pot’—as nearly as I can recollect, this was the name of the\r\n      new paper.\r\n\r\n      The leading article, I must admit, was brilliant—not to say\r\n      severe. It was especially bitter about things in general—and as\r\n      for the editor of ‘The Gazette,’ he was torn all to pieces in\r\n      particular. Some of Bullet-head’s remarks were really so fiery\r\n      that I have always, since that time, been forced to look upon\r\n      John Smith, who is still alive, in the light of a salamander. I\r\n      cannot pretend to give all the ‘Tea-Pot’s’ paragraphs verbatim,\r\n      but one of them runs thus:\r\n\r\n      ‘Oh, yes!—Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! The editor over the way\r\n      is a genius—O, my! Oh, goodness, gracious!—what is this world\r\n      coming to? Oh, tempora! Oh, Moses!’\r\n\r\n      A philippic at once so caustic and so classical, alighted like a\r\n      bombshell among the hitherto peaceful citizens of Nopolis. Groups\r\n      of excited individuals gathered at the corners of the streets.\r\n      Every one awaited, with heartfelt anxiety, the reply of the\r\n      dignified Smith. Next morning it appeared as follows:\r\n\r\n      ‘We quote from “The Tea-Pot” of yesterday the subjoined\r\n      paragraph: “Oh, yes! Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! Oh, my! Oh,\r\n      goodness! Oh, tempora! Oh, Moses!” Why, the fellow is all O! That\r\n      accounts for his reasoning in a circle, and explains why there is\r\n      neither beginning nor end to him, nor to anything he says. We\r\n      really do not believe the vagabond can write a word that hasn’t\r\n      an O in it. Wonder if this O-ing is a habit of his? By-the-by, he\r\n      came away from Down-East in a great hurry. Wonder if he O’s as\r\n      much there as he does here? “O! it is pitiful.”’\r\n\r\n      The indignation of Mr. Bullet-head at these scandalous\r\n      insinuations, I shall not attempt to describe. On the\r\n      eel-skinning principle, however, he did not seem to be so much\r\n      incensed at the attack upon his integrity as one might have\r\n      imagined. It was the sneer at his style that drove him to\r\n      desperation. What!—he Touch-and-go Bullet-head!—not able to write\r\n      a word without an O in it! He would soon let the jackanapes see\r\n      that he was mistaken. Yes! he would let him see how much he was\r\n      mistaken, the puppy! He, Touch-and-go Bullet-head, of\r\n      Frogpondium, would let Mr. John Smith perceive that he,\r\n      Bullet-head, could indite, if it so pleased him, a whole\r\n      paragraph—aye! a whole article—in which that contemptible vowel\r\n      should not once—not even once—make its appearance. But no;—that\r\n      would be yielding a point to the said John Smith. He,\r\n      Bullet-head, would make no alteration in his style, to suit the\r\n      caprices of any Mr. Smith in Christendom. Perish so vile a\r\n      thought! The O forever; He would persist in the O. He would be as\r\n      O-wy as O-wy could be.\r\n\r\n      Burning with the chivalry of this determination, the great\r\n      Touch-and-go, in the next ‘Tea-Pot,’ came out merely with this\r\n      simple but resolute paragraph, in reference to this unhappy\r\n      affair:\r\n\r\n      ‘The editor of the “Tea-Pot” has the honor of advising the editor\r\n      of the “Gazette” that he (the “Tea-Pot”) will take an opportunity\r\n      in tomorrow morning’s paper, of convincing him (the “Gazette”)\r\n      that he (the “Tea-Pot”) both can and will be _his own master_, as\r\n      regards style;—he (the “Tea-Pot”) intending to show him (the\r\n      “Gazette”) the supreme, and indeed the withering contempt with\r\n      which the criticism of him (the “Gazette”) inspires the\r\n      independent bosom of him (the “Tea-Pot”) by composing for the\r\n      especial gratification (?) of him (the “Gazette”) a leading\r\n      article, of some extent, in which the beautiful vowel—the emblem\r\n      of Eternity—yet so offensive to the hyper-exquisite delicacy of\r\n      him (the “Gazette”) shall most certainly not be avoided by his\r\n      (the “Gazette’s”) most obedient, humble servant, the “Tea-Pot.”\r\n      “So much for Buckingham!”’\r\n\r\n      In fulfilment of the awful threat thus darkly intimated rather\r\n      than decidedly enunciated, the great Bullet-head, turning a deaf\r\n      ear to all entreaties for ‘copy,’ and simply requesting his\r\n      foreman to ‘go to the d——l,’ when he (the foreman) assured him\r\n      (the ‘Tea-Pot’!) that it was high time to ‘go to press’: turning\r\n      a deaf ear to everything, I say, the great Bullet-head sat up\r\n      until day-break, consuming the midnight oil, and absorbed in the\r\n      composition of the really unparalleled paragraph, which follows:—\r\n\r\n      ‘So ho, John! how now? Told you so, you know. Don’t crow, another\r\n      time, before you’re out of the woods! Does your mother know\r\n      you’re out? Oh, no, no!—so go home at once, now, John, to your\r\n      odious old woods of Concord! Go home to your woods, old owl—go!\r\n      You won’t! Oh, poh, poh, John don’t do so! You’ve _got_ to go,\r\n      you know! So go at once, and don’t go slow, for nobody owns you\r\n      here, you know! Oh! John, John, if you don’t go you’re no\r\n      homo—no! You’re only a fowl, an owl; a cow, a sow; a doll, a\r\n      poll; a poor, old, good-for-nothing-to-nobody, log, dog, hog, or\r\n      frog, come out of a Concord bog. Cool, now—cool! Do be cool, you\r\n      fool! None of your crowing, old cock! Don’t frown so—don’t! Don’t\r\n      hollo, nor howl nor growl, nor bow-wow-wow! Good Lord, John, how\r\n      you do look! Told you so, you know—but stop rolling your goose of\r\n      an old poll about so, and go and drown your sorrows in a bowl!’\r\n\r\n      Exhausted, very naturally, by so stupendous an effort, the great\r\n      Touch-and-go could attend to nothing farther that night. Firmly,\r\n      composedly, yet with an air of conscious power, he handed his MS.\r\n      to the devil in waiting, and then, walking leisurely home,\r\n      retired, with ineffable dignity to bed.\r\n\r\n      Meantime the devil, to whom the copy was entrusted, ran up stairs\r\n      to his ‘case,’ in an unutterable hurry, and forthwith made a\r\n      commencement at ‘setting’ the MS. ‘up.’\r\n\r\n      In the first place, of course,—as the opening word was ‘So,’—he\r\n      made a plunge into the capital S hole and came out in triumph\r\n      with a capital S. Elated by this success, he immediately threw\r\n      himself upon the little-o box with a blindfold impetuosity—but\r\n      who shall describe his horror when his fingers came up without\r\n      the anticipated letter in their clutch? who shall paint his\r\n      astonishment and rage at perceiving, as he rubbed his knuckles,\r\n      that he had been only thumping them to no purpose, against the\r\n      bottom of an empty box. Not a single little-o was in the little-o\r\n      hole; and, glancing fearfully at the capital-O partition, he\r\n      found _that_, to his extreme terror, in a precisely similar\r\n      predicament. Awe-stricken, his first impulse was to rush to the\r\n      foreman.\r\n\r\n      ‘Sir!’ said he, gasping for breath, ‘I can’t never set up nothing\r\n      without no o’s.’\r\n\r\n      ‘What do you mean by that?’ growled the foreman, who was in a\r\n      very ill humor at being kept so late.\r\n\r\n      ‘Why, sir, there beant an o in the office, neither a big un nor a\r\n      little un!’\r\n\r\n      ‘What—what the d—l has become of all that were in the case?’\r\n\r\n      ‘I don’t know, sir,’ said the boy, ‘but one of them ere “G’zette”\r\n      devils is bin prowling ’bout here all night, and I spect he’s\r\n      gone and cabbaged ‘em every one.’\r\n\r\n      ‘Dod rot him! I haven’t a doubt of it,’ replied the foreman,\r\n      getting purple with rage ‘but I tell you what you do, Bob, that’s\r\n      a good boy—you go over the first chance you get and hook every\r\n      one of their i’s and (d——n them!) their izzards.’\r\n\r\n      ‘Jist so,’ replied Bob, with a wink and a frown—‘I’ll be into\r\n      ‘em, I’ll let ‘em know a thing or two; but in de meantime, that\r\n      ere paragrab? Mus go in to-night, you know—else there’ll be the\r\n      d—l to pay, and—’\r\n\r\n      ‘And not a bit of pitch hot,’ interrupted the foreman, with a\r\n      deep sigh, and an emphasis on the ‘bit.’ ‘Is it a long paragraph,\r\n      Bob?’\r\n\r\n      ‘Shouldn’t call it a _wery_ long paragrab,’ said Bob.\r\n\r\n      ‘Ah, well, then! do the best you can with it! We must get to\r\n      press,’ said the foreman, who was over head and ears in work;\r\n      ‘just stick in some other letter for o; nobody’s going to read\r\n      the fellow’s trash anyhow.’\r\n\r\n      ‘Wery well,’ replied Bob, ‘here goes it!’ and off he hurried to\r\n      his case, muttering as he went: ‘Considdeble vell, them ere\r\n      expressions, perticcler for a man as doesn’t swar. So I’s to\r\n      gouge out all their eyes, eh? and d-n all their gizzards! Vell!\r\n      this here’s the chap as is just able for to do it.’ The fact is\r\n      that although Bob was but twelve years old and four feet high, he\r\n      was equal to any amount of fight, in a small way.\r\n\r\n      The exigency here described is by no means of rare occurrence in\r\n      printing-offices; and I cannot tell how to account for it, but\r\n      the fact is indisputable, that when the exigency does occur, it\r\n      almost always happens that x is adopted as a substitute for the\r\n      letter deficient. The true reason, perhaps, is that x is rather\r\n      the most superabundant letter in the cases, or at least was so in\r\n      the old times—long enough to render the substitution in question\r\n      an habitual thing with printers. As for Bob, he would have\r\n      considered it heretical to employ any other character, in a case\r\n      of this kind, than the x to which he had been accustomed.\r\n\r\n      ‘I shell have to x this ere paragrab,’ said he to himself, as he\r\n      read it over in astonishment, ‘but it’s jest about the awfulest\r\n      o-wy paragrab I ever did see’: so x it he did, unflinchingly, and\r\n      to press it went x-ed.\r\n\r\n      Next morning the population of Nopolis were taken all aback by\r\n      reading in ‘The Tea-Pot,’ the following extraordinary leader:\r\n\r\n      ‘Sx hx, Jxhn! hxw nxw?

The first definite idea entertained by\r\n      the populace was, that some diabolical treason lay concealed in\r\n      the hieroglyphics; and there was a general rush to Bullet-head’s\r\n      residence, for the purpose of riding him on a rail; but that\r\n      gentleman was nowhere to be found. He had vanished, no one could\r\n      tell how; and not even the ghost of him has ever been seen since.\r\n\r\n      Unable to discover its legitimate object, the popular fury at\r\n      length subsided; leaving behind it, by way of sediment, quite a\r\n      medley of opinion about this unhappy affair.\r\n\r\n      One gentleman thought the whole an X-ellent joke.\r\n\r\n      Another said that, indeed, Bullet-head had shown much X-uberance\r\n      of fancy.\r\n\r\n      A third admitted him X-entric, but no more.\r\n\r\n      A fourth could only suppose it the Yankee’s design to X-press, in\r\n      a general way, his X-asperation.\r\n\r\n      ‘Say, rather, to set an X-ample to posterity,’ suggested a fifth.\r\n\r\n      That Bullet-head had been driven to an extremity, was clear to\r\n      all; and in fact, since that editor could not be found, there was\r\n      some talk about lynching the other one.\r\n\r\n      The more common conclusion, however, was that the affair was,\r\n      simply, X-traordinary and in-X-plicable. Even the town\r\n      mathematician confessed that he could make nothing of so dark a\r\n      problem. X, everybody knew, was an unknown quantity; but in this\r\n      case (as he properly observed), there was an unknown quantity of\r\n      X.\r\n\r\n      The opinion of Bob, the devil (who kept dark about his having\r\n      ‘X-ed the paragrab’), did not meet with so much attention as I\r\n      think it deserved, although it was very openly and very\r\n      fearlessly expressed. He said that, for his part, he had no doubt\r\n      about the matter at all, that it was a clear case, that Mr.\r\n      Bullet-head ‘never could be persuaded fur to drink like other\r\n      folks, but vas continually a-svigging o’ that ere blessed XXX\r\n      ale, and as a naiteral consekvence, it just puffed him up savage,\r\n      and made him X (cross) in the X-treme.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETZENGERSTEIN\r\n\r\n\r\n     Pestis eram vivus—moriens tua mors ero.\r\n                    —_Martin Luther_\r\n\r\n      Horror and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages. Why\r\n      then give a date to this story I have to tell? Let it suffice to\r\n      say, that at the period of which I speak, there existed, in the\r\n      interior of Hungary, a settled although hidden belief in the\r\n      doctrines of the Metempsychosis. Of the doctrines themselves—that\r\n      is, of their falsity, or of their probability—I say nothing. I\r\n      assert, however, that much of our incredulity—as La Bruyère says\r\n      of all our unhappiness—“_vient de ne pouvoir être seuls_.” {*1}\r\n\r\n      But there are some points in the Hungarian superstition which\r\n      were fast verging to absurdity. They—the Hungarians—differed very\r\n      essentially from their Eastern authorities. For example, “_The\r\n      soul_,” said the former—I give the words of an acute and\r\n      intelligent Parisian—“_ne demeure qu’un seul fois dans un corps\r\n      sensible: au reste—un cheval, un chien, un homme même, n’est que\r\n      la ressemblance peu tangible de ces animaux._”\r\n\r\n      The families of Berlifitzing and Metzengerstein had been at\r\n      variance for centuries. Never before were two houses so\r\n      illustrious, mutually embittered by hostility so deadly. The\r\n      origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an\r\n      ancient prophecy—“A lofty name shall have a fearful fall when, as\r\n      the rider over his horse, the mortality of Metzengerstein shall\r\n      triumph over the immortality of Berlifitzing.”\r\n\r\n      To be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning. But\r\n      more trivial causes have given rise—and that no long while ago—to\r\n      consequences equally eventful. Besides, the estates, which were\r\n      contiguous, had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs\r\n      of a busy government. Moreover, near neighbors are seldom\r\n      friends; and the inhabitants of the Castle Berlifitzing might\r\n      look, from their lofty buttresses, into the very windows of the\r\n      palace Metzengerstein. Least of all had the more than feudal\r\n      magnificence, thus discovered, a tendency to allay the irritable\r\n      feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy Berlifitzings. What\r\n      wonder then, that the words, however silly, of that prediction,\r\n      should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two\r\n      families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of\r\n      hereditary jealousy? The prophecy seemed to imply—if it implied\r\n      anything—a final triumph on the part of the already more powerful\r\n      house; and was of course remembered with the more bitter\r\n      animosity by the weaker and less influential.\r\n\r\n      Wilhelm, Count Berlifitzing, although loftily descended, was, at\r\n      the epoch of this narrative, an infirm and doting old man,\r\n      remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal\r\n      antipathy to the family of his rival, and so passionate a love of\r\n      horses, and of hunting, that neither bodily infirmity, great age,\r\n      nor mental incapacity, prevented his daily participation in the\r\n      dangers of the chase.\r\n\r\n      Frederick, Baron Metzengerstein, was, on the other hand, not yet\r\n      of age. His father, the Minister G—, died young. His mother, the\r\n      Lady Mary, followed him quickly after. Frederick was, at that\r\n      time, in his fifteenth year. In a city, fifteen years are no long\r\n      period—a child may be still a child in his third lustrum: but in\r\n      a wilderness—in so magnificent a wilderness as that old\r\n      principality, fifteen years have a far deeper meaning.\r\n\r\n      From some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of\r\n      his father, the young Baron, at the decease of the former,\r\n      entered immediately upon his vast possessions. Such estates were\r\n      seldom held before by a nobleman of Hungary. His castles were\r\n      without number. The chief in point of splendor and extent was the\r\n      “Château Metzengerstein.” The boundary line of his dominions was\r\n      never clearly defined; but his principal park embraced a circuit\r\n      of fifty miles.\r\n\r\n      Upon the succession of a proprietor so young, with a character so\r\n      well known, to a fortune so unparalleled, little speculation was\r\n      afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct. And, indeed,\r\n      for the space of three days, the behavior of the heir out-Heroded\r\n      Herod, and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most\r\n      enthusiastic admirers. Shameful debaucheries—flagrant\r\n      treacheries—unheard-of atrocities—gave his trembling vassals\r\n      quickly to understand that no servile submission on their part—no\r\n      punctilios of conscience on his own—were thenceforward to prove\r\n      any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty Caligula.\r\n      On the night of the fourth day, the stables of the castle\r\n      Berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire; and the unanimous\r\n      opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to\r\n      the already hideous list of the Baron’s misdemeanors and\r\n      enormities.\r\n\r\n      But during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence, the young\r\n      nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation, in a vast\r\n      and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of\r\n      Metzengerstein. The rich although faded tapestry hangings which\r\n      swung gloomily upon the walls, represented the shadowy and\r\n      majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors. _Here_,\r\n      rich-ermined priests, and pontifical dignitaries, familiarly\r\n      seated with the autocrat and the sovereign, put a veto on the\r\n      wishes of a temporal king, or restrained with the fiat of papal\r\n      supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the Arch-enemy. _There_, the\r\n      dark, tall statures of the Princes Metzengerstein—their muscular\r\n      war-coursers plunging over the carcasses of fallen foes—startled\r\n      the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression; and _here_,\r\n      again, the voluptuous and swan-like figures of the dames of days\r\n      gone by, floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the\r\n      strains of imaginary melody.\r\n\r\n      But as the Baron listened, or affected to listen, to the\r\n      gradually increasing uproar in the stables of Berlifitzing—or\r\n      perhaps pondered upon some more novel, some more decided act of\r\n      audacity—his eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an\r\n      enormous, and unnaturally colored horse, represented in the\r\n      tapestry as belonging to a Saracen ancestor of the family of his\r\n      rival. The horse itself, in the foreground of the design, stood\r\n      motionless and statue-like—while farther back, its discomfited\r\n      rider perished by the dagger of a Metzengerstein.\r\n\r\n      On Frederick’s lip arose a fiendish expression, as he became\r\n      aware of the direction which his glance had, without his\r\n      consciousness, assumed. Yet he did not remove it. On the\r\n      contrary, he could by no means account for the overwhelming\r\n      anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses. It\r\n      was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent\r\n      feelings with the certainty of being awake. The longer he gazed\r\n      the more absorbing became the spell—the more impossible did it\r\n      appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the\r\n      fascination of that tapestry. But the tumult without becoming\r\n      suddenly more violent, with a compulsory exertion he diverted his\r\n      attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming\r\n      stables upon the windows of the apartment.\r\n\r\n      The action, however, was but momentary, his gaze returned\r\n      mechanically to the wall. To his extreme horror and astonishment,\r\n      the head of the gigantic steed had, in the meantime, altered its\r\n      position. The neck of the animal, before arched, as if in\r\n      compassion, over the prostrate body of its lord, was now\r\n      extended, at full length, in the direction of the Baron. The\r\n      eyes, before invisible, now wore an energetic and human\r\n      expression, while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red; and\r\n      the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full\r\n      view his gigantic and disgusting teeth.\r\n\r\n      Stupefied with terror, the young nobleman tottered to the door.\r\n      As he threw it open, a flash of red light, streaming far into the\r\n      chamber, flung his shadow with a clear outline against the\r\n      quivering tapestry, and he shuddered to perceive that shadow—as\r\n      he staggered awhile upon the threshold—assuming the exact\r\n      position, and precisely filling up the contour, of the relentless\r\n      and triumphant murderer of the Saracen Berlifitzing.\r\n\r\n      To lighten the depression of his spirits, the Baron hurried into\r\n      the open air. At the principal gate of the palace he encountered\r\n      three equerries. With much difficulty, and at the imminent peril\r\n      of their lives, they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a\r\n      gigantic and fiery-colored horse.\r\n\r\n      “Whose horse? Where did you get him?” demanded the youth, in a\r\n      querulous and husky tone of voice, as he became instantly aware\r\n      that the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very\r\n      counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes.\r\n\r\n      “He is your own property, sire,” replied one of the equerries,\r\n      “at least he is claimed by no other owner. We caught him flying,\r\n      all smoking and foaming with rage, from the burning stables of\r\n      the Castle Berlifitzing. Supposing him to have belonged to the\r\n      old Count’s stud of foreign horses, we led him back as an estray.\r\n      But the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature; which is\r\n      strange, since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow\r\n      escape from the flames.\r\n\r\n      “The letters W. V. B. are also branded very distinctly on his\r\n      forehead,” interrupted a second equerry, “I supposed them, of\r\n      course, to be the initials of Wilhelm Von Berlifitzing—but all at\r\n      the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse.”\r\n\r\n      “Extremely singular!” said the young Baron, with a musing air,\r\n      and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words. “He is,\r\n      as you say, a remarkable horse—a prodigious horse! although, as\r\n      you very justly observe, of a suspicious and untractable\r\n      character; let him be mine, however,” he added, after a pause,\r\n      “perhaps a rider like Frederick of Metzengerstein, may tame even\r\n      the devil from the stables of Berlifitzing.”\r\n\r\n      “You are mistaken, my lord; the horse, as I think we mentioned,\r\n      is _not_ from the stables of the Count. If such had been the\r\n      case, we know our duty better than to bring him into the presence\r\n      of a noble of your family.”\r\n\r\n      “True!” observed the Baron, dryly, and at that instant a page of\r\n      the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color, and\r\n      a precipitate step. He whispered into his master’s ear an account\r\n      of the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry,\r\n      in an apartment which he designated; entering, at the same time,\r\n      into particulars of a minute and circumstantial character; but\r\n      from the low tone of voice in which these latter were\r\n      communicated, nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of\r\n      the equerries.\r\n\r\n      The young Frederick, during the conference, seemed agitated by a\r\n      variety of emotions. He soon, however, recovered his composure,\r\n      and an expression of determined malignancy settled upon his\r\n      countenance, as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber\r\n      should be immediately locked up, and the key placed in his own\r\n      possession.\r\n\r\n      “Have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter\r\n      Berlifitzing?” said one of his vassals to the Baron, as, after\r\n      the departure of the page, the huge steed which that nobleman had\r\n      adopted as his own, plunged and curvetted, with redoubled fury,\r\n      down the long avenue which extended from the château to the\r\n      stables of Metzengerstein.\r\n\r\n      “No!” said the Baron, turning abruptly toward the speaker, “dead!\r\n      say you?”\r\n\r\n      “It is indeed true, my lord; and, to a noble of your name, will\r\n      be, I imagine, no unwelcome intelligence.”\r\n\r\n      A rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener. “How\r\n      died he?”\r\n\r\n      “In his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his\r\n      hunting stud, he has himself perished miserably in the flames.”\r\n\r\n      “I-n-d-e-e-d-!” ejaculated the Baron, as if slowly and\r\n      deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea.\r\n\r\n      “Indeed;” repeated the vassal.\r\n\r\n      “Shocking!” said the youth, calmly, and turned quietly into the\r\n      château.\r\n\r\n      From this date a marked alteration took place in the outward\r\n      demeanor of the dissolute young Baron Frederick Von\r\n      Metzengerstein. Indeed, his behavior disappointed every\r\n      expectation, and proved little in accordance with the views of\r\n      many a manoeuvering mamma; while his habits and manner, still\r\n      less than formerly, offered any thing congenial with those of the\r\n      neighboring aristocracy. He was never to be seen beyond the\r\n      limits of his own domain, and, in this wide and social world, was\r\n      utterly companionless—unless, indeed, that unnatural, impetuous,\r\n      and fiery-colored horse, which he henceforward continually\r\n      bestrode, had any mysterious right to the title of his friend.\r\n\r\n      Numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long\r\n      time, however, periodically came in. “Will the Baron honor our\r\n      festivals with his presence?” “Will the Baron join us in a\r\n      hunting of the boar?”—“Metzengerstein does not hunt;”\r\n      “Metzengerstein will not attend,” were the haughty and laconic\r\n      answers.\r\n\r\n      These repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious\r\n      nobility. Such invitations became less cordial—less frequent—in\r\n      time they ceased altogether. The widow of the unfortunate Count\r\n      Berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope “that the Baron\r\n      might be at home when he did not wish to be at home, since he\r\n      disdained the company of his equals; and ride when he did not\r\n      wish to ride, since he preferred the society of a horse.” This to\r\n      be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique; and\r\n      merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to\r\n      become, when we desire to be unusually energetic.\r\n\r\n      The charitable, nevertheless, attributed the alteration in the\r\n      conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for\r\n      the untimely loss of his parents—forgetting, however, his\r\n      atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period\r\n      immediately succeeding that bereavement. Some there were, indeed,\r\n      who suggested a too haughty idea of self-consequence and dignity.\r\n      Others again (among them may be mentioned the family physician)\r\n      did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy, and hereditary\r\n      ill-health; while dark hints, of a more equivocal nature, were\r\n      current among the multitude.\r\n\r\n      Indeed, the Baron’s perverse attachment to his lately-acquired\r\n      charger—an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from\r\n      every fresh example of the animal’s ferocious and demon-like\r\n      propensities—at length became, in the eyes of all reasonable men,\r\n      a hideous and unnatural fervor. In the glare of noon—at the dead\r\n      hour of night—in sickness or in health—in calm or in tempest—the\r\n      young Metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that\r\n      colossal horse, whose intractable audacities so well accorded\r\n      with his own spirit.\r\n\r\n      There were circumstances, moreover, which coupled with late\r\n      events, gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania\r\n      of the rider, and to the capabilities of the steed. The space\r\n      passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured, and\r\n      was found to exceed, by an astounding difference, the wildest\r\n      expectations of the most imaginative. The Baron, besides, had no\r\n      particular _name_ for the animal, although all the rest in his\r\n      collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations. His\r\n      stable, too, was appointed at a distance from the rest; and with\r\n      regard to grooming and other necessary offices, none but the\r\n      owner in person had ventured to officiate, or even to enter the\r\n      enclosure of that particular stall. It was also to be observed,\r\n      that although the three grooms, who had caught the steed as he\r\n      fled from the conflagration at Berlifitzing, had succeeded in\r\n      arresting his course, by means of a chain-bridle and noose—yet no\r\n      one of the three could with any certainty affirm that he had,\r\n      during that dangerous struggle, or at any period thereafter,\r\n      actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast. Instances of\r\n      peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and\r\n      high-spirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting\r\n      unreasonable attention—especially among men who, daily trained to\r\n      the labors of the chase, might appear well acquainted with the\r\n      sagacity of a horse—but there were certain circumstances which\r\n      intruded themselves per force upon the most skeptical and\r\n      phlegmatic; and it is said there were times when the animal\r\n      caused the gaping crowd who stood around to recoil in horror from\r\n      the deep and impressive meaning of his terrible stamp—times when\r\n      the young Metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away from the\r\n      rapid and searching expression of his earnest and human-looking\r\n      eye.\r\n\r\n      Among all the retinue of the Baron, however, none were found to\r\n      doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on\r\n      the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his\r\n      horse; at least, none but an insignificant and misshapen little\r\n      page, whose deformities were in everybody’s way, and whose\r\n      opinions were of the least possible importance. He—if his ideas\r\n      are worth mentioning at all—had the effrontery to assert that his\r\n      master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and\r\n      almost imperceptible shudder, and that, upon his return from\r\n      every long-continued and habitual ride, an expression of\r\n      triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance.\r\n\r\n      One tempestuous night, Metzengerstein, awaking from a heavy\r\n      slumber, descended like a maniac from his chamber, and, mounting\r\n      in hot haste, bounded away into the mazes of the forest. An\r\n      occurrence so common attracted no particular attention, but his\r\n      return was looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his\r\n      domestics, when, after some hours’ absence, the stupendous and\r\n      magnificent battlements of the Chateau Metzengerstein, were\r\n      discovered crackling and rocking to their very foundation, under\r\n      the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire.\r\n\r\n      As the flames, when first seen, had already made so terrible a\r\n      progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building\r\n      were evidently futile, the astonished neighborhood stood idly\r\n      around in silent and pathetic wonder. But a new and fearful\r\n      object soon rivetted the attention of the multitude, and proved\r\n      how much more intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings\r\n      of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony, than that brought\r\n      about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate matter.\r\n\r\n      Up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the\r\n      main entrance of the Château Metzengerstein, a steed, bearing an\r\n      unbonneted and disordered rider, was seen leaping with an\r\n      impetuosity which outstripped the very Demon of the Tempest.\r\n\r\n      The career of the horseman was indisputably, on his own part,\r\n      uncontrollable. The agony of his countenance, the convulsive\r\n      struggle of his frame, gave evidence of superhuman exertion: but\r\n      no sound, save a solitary shriek, escaped from his lacerated\r\n      lips, which were bitten through and through in the intensity of\r\n      terror. One instant, and the clattering of hoofs resounded\r\n      sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the\r\n      shrieking of the winds—another, and, clearing at a single plunge\r\n      the gate-way and the moat, the steed bounded far up the tottering\r\n      staircases of the palace, and, with its rider, disappeared amid\r\n      the whirlwind of chaotic fire.\r\n\r\n      The fury of the tempest immediately died away, and a dead calm\r\n      sullenly succeeded. A white flame still enveloped the building\r\n      like a shroud, and, streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere,\r\n      shot forth a glare of preternatural light; while a cloud of smoke\r\n      settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal\r\n      figure of—_a horse_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYSTEM OF DOCTOR TARR AND PROFESSOR FETHER\r\n\r\n\r\n      During the autumn of 18—, while on a tour through the extreme\r\n      southern provinces of France, my route led me within a few miles\r\n      of a certain _Maison de Santé_ or private mad-house, about which\r\n      I had heard much, in Paris, from my medical friends. As I had\r\n      never visited a place of the kind, I thought the opportunity too\r\n      good to be lost; and so proposed to my travelling companion (a\r\n      gentleman with whom I had made casual acquaintance a few days\r\n      before), that we should turn aside, for an hour or so, and look\r\n      through the establishment. To this he objected—pleading haste in\r\n      the first place, and, in the second, a very usual horror at the\r\n      sight of a lunatic. He begged me, however, not to let any mere\r\n      courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my\r\n      curiosity, and said that he would ride on leisurely, so that I\r\n      might overtake him during the day, or, at all events, during the\r\n      next. As he bade me good-bye, I bethought me that there might be\r\n      some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises, and\r\n      mentioned my fears on this point. He replied that, in fact,\r\n      unless I had personal knowledge of the superintendent, Monsieur\r\n      Maillard, or some credential in the way of a letter, a difficulty\r\n      might be found to exist, as the regulations of these private\r\n      mad-houses were more rigid than the public hospital laws. For\r\n      himself, he added, he had, some years since, made the\r\n      acquaintance of Maillard, and would so far assist me as to ride\r\n      up to the door and introduce me; although his feelings on the\r\n      subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house.\r\n\r\n      I thanked him, and, turning from the main road, we entered a\r\n      grass-grown by-path, which, in half an hour, nearly lost itself\r\n      in a dense forest, clothing the base of a mountain. Through this\r\n      dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles, when the _Maison de\r\n      Santé_ came in view. It was a fantastic château, much\r\n      dilapidated, and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and\r\n      neglect. Its aspect inspired me with absolute dread, and,\r\n      checking my horse, I half resolved to turn back. I soon, however,\r\n      grew ashamed of my weakness, and proceeded.\r\n\r\n      As we rode up to the gate-way, I perceived it slightly open, and\r\n      the visage of a man peering through. In an instant afterward,\r\n      this man came forth, accosted my companion by name, shook him\r\n      cordially by the hand, and begged him to alight. It was Monsieur\r\n      Maillard himself. He was a portly, fine-looking gentleman of the\r\n      old school, with a polished manner, and a certain air of gravity,\r\n      dignity, and authority which was very impressive.\r\n\r\n      My friend, having presented me, mentioned my desire to inspect\r\n      the establishment, and received Monsieur Maillard’s assurance\r\n      that he would show me all attention, now took leave, and I saw\r\n      him no more.\r\n\r\n      When he had gone, the superintendent ushered me into a small and\r\n      exceedingly neat parlor, containing, among other indications of\r\n      refined taste, many books, drawings, pots of flowers, and musical\r\n      instruments. A cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth. At a piano,\r\n      singing an aria from Bellini, sat a young and very beautiful\r\n      woman, who, at my entrance, paused in her song, and received me\r\n      with graceful courtesy. Her voice was low, and her whole manner\r\n      subdued. I thought, too, that I perceived the traces of sorrow in\r\n      her countenance, which was excessively, although to my taste, not\r\n      unpleasingly, pale. She was attired in deep mourning, and excited\r\n      in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect, interest, and\r\n      admiration.\r\n\r\n      I had heard, at Paris, that the institution of Monsieur Maillard\r\n      was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the “system of\r\n      soothing”—that all punishments were avoided—that even confinement\r\n      was seldom resorted to—that the patients, while secretly watched,\r\n      were left much apparent liberty, and that most of them were\r\n      permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary\r\n      apparel of persons in right mind.\r\n\r\n      Keeping these impressions in view, I was cautious in what I said\r\n      before the young lady; for I could not be sure that she was sane;\r\n      and, in fact, there was a certain restless brilliancy about her\r\n      eyes which half led me to imagine she was not. I confined my\r\n      remarks, therefore, to general topics, and to such as I thought\r\n      would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic. She\r\n      replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that I said; and\r\n      even her original observations were marked with the soundest good\r\n      sense, but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania, had\r\n      taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity, and I\r\n      continued to practise, throughout the interview, the caution with\r\n      which I commenced it.\r\n\r\n      Presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit,\r\n      wine, and other refreshments, of which I partook, the lady soon\r\n      afterward leaving the room. As she departed I turned my eyes in\r\n      an inquiring manner toward my host.\r\n\r\n      “No,” he said, “oh, no—a member of my family—my niece, and a most\r\n      accomplished woman.”\r\n\r\n      “I beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion,” I replied, “but of\r\n      course you will know how to excuse me. The excellent\r\n      administration of your affairs here is well understood in Paris,\r\n      and I thought it just possible, you know—”\r\n\r\n      “Yes, yes—say no more—or rather it is myself who should thank you\r\n      for the commendable prudence you have displayed. We seldom find\r\n      so much of forethought in young men; and, more than once, some\r\n      unhappy contre-temps has occurred in consequence of\r\n      thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors. While my former\r\n      system was in operation, and my patients were permitted the\r\n      privilege of roaming to and fro at will, they were often aroused\r\n      to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to\r\n      inspect the house. Hence I was obliged to enforce a rigid system\r\n      of exclusion; and none obtained access to the premises upon whose\r\n      discretion I could not rely.”\r\n\r\n      “While your former system was in operation!” I said, repeating\r\n      his words—“do I understand you, then, to say that the ‘soothing\r\n      system’ of which I have heard so much is no longer in force?”\r\n\r\n      “It is now,” he replied, “several weeks since we have concluded\r\n      to renounce it forever.”\r\n\r\n      “Indeed! you astonish me!”\r\n\r\n      “We found it, sir,” he said, with a sigh, “absolutely necessary\r\n      to return to the old usages. The danger of the soothing system\r\n      was, at all times, appalling; and its advantages have been much\r\n      overrated. I believe, sir, that in this house it has been given a\r\n      fair trial, if ever in any. We did every thing that rational\r\n      humanity could suggest. I am sorry that you could not have paid\r\n      us a visit at an earlier period, that you might have judged for\r\n      yourself. But I presume you are conversant with the soothing\r\n      practice—with its details.”\r\n\r\n      “Not altogether. What I have heard has been at third or fourth\r\n      hand.”\r\n\r\n      “I may state the system, then, in general terms, as one in which\r\n      the patients were _menagés_—humored. We contradicted no fancies\r\n      which entered the brains of the mad. On the contrary, we not only\r\n      indulged but encouraged them; and many of our most permanent\r\n      cures have been thus effected. There is no argument which so\r\n      touches the feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad\r\n      absurdum. We have had men, for example, who fancied themselves\r\n      chickens. The cure was, to insist upon the thing as a fact—to\r\n      accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it\r\n      to be a fact—and thus to refuse him any other diet for a week\r\n      than that which properly appertains to a chicken. In this manner\r\n      a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders.”\r\n\r\n      “But was this species of acquiescence all?”\r\n\r\n      “By no means. We put much faith in amusements of a simple kind,\r\n      such as music, dancing, gymnastic exercises generally, cards,\r\n      certain classes of books, and so forth. We affected to treat each\r\n      individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder; and the\r\n      word ‘lunacy’ was never employed. A great point was to set each\r\n      lunatic to guard the actions of all the others. To repose\r\n      confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman, is to\r\n      gain him body and soul. In this way we were enabled to dispense\r\n      with an expensive body of keepers.”\r\n\r\n      “And you had no punishments of any kind?”\r\n\r\n      “None.”\r\n\r\n      “And you never confined your patients?”\r\n\r\n      “Very rarely. Now and then, the malady of some individual growing\r\n      to a crisis, or taking a sudden turn of fury, we conveyed him to\r\n      a secret cell, lest his disorder should infect the rest, and\r\n      there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friends—for with\r\n      the raging maniac we have nothing to do. He is usually removed to\r\n      the public hospitals.”\r\n\r\n      “And you have now changed all this—and you think for the better?”\r\n\r\n      “Decidedly. The system had its disadvantages, and even its\r\n      dangers. It is now, happily, exploded throughout all the _Maisons\r\n      de Santé_ of France.”\r\n\r\n      “I am very much surprised,” I said, “at what you tell me; for I\r\n      made sure that, at this moment, no other method of treatment for\r\n      mania existed in any portion of the country.”\r\n\r\n      “You are young yet, my friend,” replied my host, “but the time\r\n      will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is\r\n      going on in the world, without trusting to the gossip of others.\r\n      Believe nothing you hear, and only one-half that you see. Now\r\n      about our _Maisons de Santé_, it is clear that some ignoramus has\r\n      misled you. After dinner, however, when you have sufficiently\r\n      recovered from the fatigue of your ride, I will be happy to take\r\n      you over the house, and introduce to you a system which, in my\r\n      opinion, and in that of every one who has witnessed its\r\n      operation, is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised.”\r\n\r\n      “Your own?” I inquired—“one of your own invention?”\r\n\r\n      “I am proud,” he replied, “to acknowledge that it is—at least in\r\n      some measure.”\r\n\r\n      In this manner I conversed with Monsieur Maillard for an hour or\r\n      two, during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of\r\n      the place.\r\n\r\n      “I cannot let you see my patients,” he said, “just at present. To\r\n      a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in\r\n      such exhibitions; and I do not wish to spoil your appetite for\r\n      dinner. We will dine. I can give you some veal a la Menehoult,\r\n      with cauliflowers in _velouté_ sauce—after that a glass of Clos\r\n      de Vougeot—then your nerves will be sufficiently steadied.”\r\n\r\n      At six, dinner was announced; and my host conducted me into a\r\n      large _salle à manger_, where a very numerous company were\r\n      assembled—twenty-five or thirty in all. They were, apparently,\r\n      people of rank—certainly of high breeding—although their\r\n      habiliments, I thought, were extravagantly rich, partaking\r\n      somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the _vielle\r\n      cour_. I noticed that at least two-thirds of these guests were\r\n      ladies; and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what\r\n      a Parisian would consider good taste at the present day. Many\r\n      females, for example, whose age could not have been less than\r\n      seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry, such as rings,\r\n      bracelets, and earrings, and wore their bosoms and arms\r\n      shamefully bare. I observed, too, that very few of the dresses\r\n      were well made—or, at least, that very few of them fitted the\r\n      wearers. In looking about, I discovered the interesting girl to\r\n      whom Monsieur Maillard had presented me in the little parlor; but\r\n      my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale,\r\n      with high-heeled shoes, and a dirty cap of Brussels lace, so much\r\n      too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive\r\n      expression. When I had first seen her, she was attired, most\r\n      becomingly, in deep mourning. There was an air of oddity, in\r\n      short, about the dress of the whole party, which, at first,\r\n      caused me to recur to my original idea of the “soothing system,”\r\n      and to fancy that Monsieur Maillard had been willing to deceive\r\n      me until after dinner, that I might experience no uncomfortable\r\n      feelings during the repast, at finding myself dining with\r\n      lunatics; but I remembered having been informed, in Paris, that\r\n      the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people,\r\n      with a vast number of antiquated notions; and then, too, upon\r\n      conversing with several members of the company, my apprehensions\r\n      were immediately and fully dispelled.\r\n\r\n      The dining-room itself, although perhaps sufficiently comfortable\r\n      and of good dimensions, had nothing too much of elegance about\r\n      it. For example, the floor was uncarpeted; in France, however, a\r\n      carpet is frequently dispensed with. The windows, too, were\r\n      without curtains; the shutters, being shut, were securely\r\n      fastened with iron bars, applied diagonally, after the fashion of\r\n      our ordinary shop-shutters. The apartment, I observed, formed, in\r\n      itself, a wing of the château, and thus the windows were on three\r\n      sides of the parallelogram, the door being at the other. There\r\n      were no less than ten windows in all.\r\n\r\n      The table was superbly set out. It was loaded with plate, and\r\n      more than loaded with delicacies. The profusion was absolutely\r\n      barbaric. There were meats enough to have feasted the Anakim.\r\n      Never, in all my life, had I witnessed so lavish, so wasteful an\r\n      expenditure of the good things of life. There seemed very little\r\n      taste, however, in the arrangements; and my eyes, accustomed to\r\n      quiet lights, were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a\r\n      multitude of wax candles, which, in silver candelabra, were\r\n      deposited upon the table, and all about the room, wherever it was\r\n      possible to find a place. There were several active servants in\r\n      attendance; and, upon a large table, at the farther end of the\r\n      apartment, were seated seven or eight people with fiddles, fifes,\r\n      trombones, and a drum. These fellows annoyed me very much, at\r\n      intervals, during the repast, by an infinite variety of noises,\r\n      which were intended for music, and which appeared to afford much\r\n      entertainment to all present, with the exception of myself.\r\n\r\n      Upon the whole, I could not help thinking that there was much of\r\n      the bizarre about every thing I saw—but then the world is made up\r\n      of all kinds of persons, with all modes of thought, and all sorts\r\n      of conventional customs. I had travelled, too, so much, as to be\r\n      quite an adept at the nil admirari; so I took my seat very coolly\r\n      at the right hand of my host, and, having an excellent appetite,\r\n      did justice to the good cheer set before me.\r\n\r\n      The conversation, in the meantime, was spirited and general. The\r\n      ladies, as usual, talked a great deal. I soon found that nearly\r\n      all the company were well educated; and my host was a world of\r\n      good-humored anecdote in himself. He seemed quite willing to\r\n      speak of his position as superintendent of a_Maison de Santé_;\r\n      and, indeed, the topic of lunacy was, much to my surprise, a\r\n      favorite one with all present. A great many amusing stories were\r\n      told, having reference to the _whims_ of the patients.\r\n\r\n      “We had a fellow here once,” said a fat little gentleman, who sat\r\n      at my right,—“a fellow that fancied himself a tea-pot; and by the\r\n      way, is it not especially singular how often this particular\r\n      crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic? There is scarcely\r\n      an insane asylum in France which cannot supply a human tea-pot.\r\n      Our gentleman was a Britannia-ware tea-pot, and was careful to\r\n      polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting.”\r\n\r\n      “And then,” said a tall man just opposite, “we had here, not long\r\n      ago, a person who had taken it into his head that he was a\r\n      donkey—which allegorically speaking, you will say, was quite\r\n      true. He was a troublesome patient; and we had much ado to keep\r\n      him within bounds. For a long time he would eat nothing but\r\n      thistles; but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon\r\n      his eating nothing else. Then he was perpetually kicking out his\r\n      heels—so—so—”\r\n\r\n      “Mr. De Kock! I will thank you to behave yourself!” here\r\n      interrupted an old lady, who sat next to the speaker. “Please\r\n      keep your feet to yourself! You have spoiled my brocade! Is it\r\n      necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?\r\n      Our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this. Upon\r\n      my word, you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate\r\n      imagined himself. Your acting is very natural, as I live.”\r\n\r\n      “Mille pardons! Ma’m’selle!” replied Monsieur De Kock, thus\r\n      addressed—“a thousand pardons! I had no intention of offending.\r\n      Ma’m’selle Laplace—Monsieur De Kock will do himself the honor of\r\n      taking wine with you.”\r\n\r\n      Here Monsieur De Kock bowed low, kissed his hand with much\r\n      ceremony, and took wine with Ma’m’selle Laplace.\r\n\r\n      “Allow me, mon ami,” now said Monsieur Maillard, addressing\r\n      myself, “allow me to send you a morsel of this veal _à la St.\r\n      Menehoult_—you will find it particularly fine.”\r\n\r\n      At this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in\r\n      depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish, or trencher,\r\n      containing what I supposed to be the “_monstrum, horrendum,\r\n      informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum_.” A closer scrutiny assured\r\n      me, however, that it was only a small calf roasted whole, and set\r\n      upon its knees, with an apple in its mouth, as is the English\r\n      fashion of dressing a hare.\r\n\r\n      “Thank you, no,” I replied; “to say the truth, I am not\r\n      particularly partial to veal _à la St_.—what is it?—for I do not\r\n      find that it altogether agrees with me. I will change my plate,\r\n      however, and try some of the rabbit.”\r\n\r\n      There were several side-dishes on the table, containing what\r\n      appeared to be the ordinary French rabbit—a very delicious\r\n      morceau, which I can recommend.\r\n\r\n      “Pierre,” cried the host, “change this gentleman’s plate, and\r\n      give him a side-piece of this rabbit au-chat.”\r\n\r\n      “This what?” said I.\r\n\r\n      “This rabbit _au-chat_.”\r\n\r\n      “Why, thank you—upon second thoughts, no. I will just help myself\r\n      to some of the ham.”\r\n\r\n      There is no knowing what one eats, thought I to myself, at the\r\n      tables of these people of the province. I will have none of their\r\n      rabbit _au-chat_—and, for the matter of that, none of their\r\n      _cat-au-rabbit_ either.\r\n\r\n      “And then,” said a cadaverous looking personage, near the foot of\r\n      the table, taking up the thread of the conversation where it had\r\n      been broken off,—“and then, among other oddities, we had a\r\n      patient, once upon a time, who very pertinaciously maintained\r\n      himself to be a Cordova cheese, and went about, with a knife in\r\n      his hand, soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the\r\n      middle of his leg.”\r\n\r\n      “He was a great fool, beyond doubt,” interposed some one, “but\r\n      not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know,\r\n      with the exception of this strange gentleman. I mean the man who\r\n      took himself for a bottle of champagne, and always went off with\r\n      a pop and a fizz, in this fashion.”\r\n\r\n      Here the speaker, very rudely, as I thought, put his right thumb\r\n      in his left cheek, withdrew it with a sound resembling the\r\n      popping of a cork, and then, by a dexterous movement of the\r\n      tongue upon the teeth, created a sharp hissing and fizzing, which\r\n      lasted for several minutes, in imitation of the frothing of\r\n      champagne. This behavior, I saw plainly, was not very pleasing to\r\n      Monsieur Maillard; but that gentleman said nothing, and the\r\n      conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig.\r\n\r\n      “And then there was an ignoramus,” said he, “who mistook himself\r\n      for a frog, which, by the way, he resembled in no little degree.\r\n      I wish you could have seen him, sir,”—here the speaker addressed\r\n      myself—“it would have done your heart good to see the natural\r\n      airs that he put on. Sir, if that man was not a frog, I can only\r\n      observe that it is a pity he was not. His croak\r\n      thus—o-o-o-o-gh—o-o-o-o-gh! was the finest note in the world—B\r\n      flat; and when he put his elbows upon the table thus—after taking\r\n      a glass or two of wine—and distended his mouth, thus, and rolled\r\n      up his eyes, thus, and winked them with excessive rapidity, thus,\r\n      why then, sir, I take it upon myself to say, positively, that you\r\n      would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man.”\r\n\r\n      “I have no doubt of it,” I said.\r\n\r\n      “And then,” said somebody else, “then there was Petit Gaillard,\r\n      who thought himself a pinch of snuff, and was truly distressed\r\n      because he could not take himself between his own finger and\r\n      thumb.”\r\n\r\n      “And then there was Jules Desoulières, who was a very singular\r\n      genius, indeed, and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin.\r\n      He persecuted the cook to make him up into pies—a thing which the\r\n      cook indignantly refused to do. For my part, I am by no means\r\n      sure that a pumpkin pie _à la Desoulières_ would not have been\r\n      very capital eating indeed!”\r\n\r\n      “You astonish me!” said I; and I looked inquisitively at Monsieur\r\n      Maillard.\r\n\r\n      “Ha! ha! ha!” said that gentleman—“he! he! he!—hi! hi! hi!—ho!\r\n      ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!—very good indeed! You must not be astonished,\r\n      _mon ami;_ our friend here is a wit—a _drôle_—you must not\r\n      understand him to the letter.”\r\n\r\n      “And then,” said some other one of the party,—“then there was\r\n      Bouffon Le Grand—another extraordinary personage in his way. He\r\n      grew deranged through love, and fancied himself possessed of two\r\n      heads. One of these he maintained to be the head of Cicero; the\r\n      other he imagined a composite one, being Demosthenes’ from the\r\n      top of the forehead to the mouth, and Lord Brougham’s from the\r\n      mouth to the chin. It is not impossible that he was wrong; but he\r\n      would have convinced you of his being in the right; for he was a\r\n      man of great eloquence. He had an absolute passion for oratory,\r\n      and could not refrain from display. For example, he used to leap\r\n      upon the dinner-table thus, and—and—”\r\n\r\n      Here a friend, at the side of the speaker, put a hand upon his\r\n      shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear; upon which he\r\n      ceased talking with great suddenness, and sank back within his\r\n      chair.\r\n\r\n      “And then,” said the friend who had whispered, “there was\r\n      Boullard, the tee-totum. I call him the tee-totum because, in\r\n      fact, he was seized with the droll, but not altogether\r\n      irrational, crotchet, that he had been converted into a\r\n      tee-totum. You would have roared with laughter to see him spin.\r\n      He would turn round upon one heel by the hour, in this\r\n      manner—so—”\r\n\r\n      Here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper,\r\n      performed an exactly similar office for himself.\r\n\r\n      “But then,” cried the old lady, at the top of her voice, “your\r\n      Monsieur Boullard was a madman, and a very silly madman at best;\r\n      for who, allow me to ask you, ever heard of a human tee-totum?\r\n      The thing is absurd. Madame Joyeuse was a more sensible person,\r\n      as you know. She had a crotchet, but it was instinct with common\r\n      sense, and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her\r\n      acquaintance. She found, upon mature deliberation, that, by some\r\n      accident, she had been turned into a chicken-cock; but, as such,\r\n      she behaved with propriety. She flapped her wings with prodigious\r\n      effect—so—so—so—and, as for her crow, it was delicious!\r\n      Cock-a-doodle-doo!—cock-a-doodle-doo!—cock-a-doodle-de-doo\r\n      dooo-do-o-o-o-o-o-o!”\r\n\r\n      “Madame Joyeuse, I will thank you to behave yourself!” here\r\n      interrupted our host, very angrily. “You can either conduct\r\n      yourself as a lady should do, or you can quit the table\r\n      forthwith—take your choice.”\r\n\r\n      The lady (whom I was much astonished to hear addressed as Madame\r\n      Joyeuse, after the description of Madame Joyeuse she had just\r\n      given) blushed up to the eyebrows, and seemed exceedingly abashed\r\n      at the reproof. She hung down her head, and said not a syllable\r\n      in reply. But another and younger lady resumed the theme. It was\r\n      my beautiful girl of the little parlor.\r\n\r\n      “Oh, Madame Joyeuse was a fool!” she exclaimed, “but there was\r\n      really much sound sense, after all, in the opinion of Eugénie\r\n      Salsafette. She was a very beautiful and painfully modest young\r\n      lady, who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent, and\r\n      wished to dress herself, always, by getting outside instead of\r\n      inside of her clothes. It is a thing very easily done, after all.\r\n      You have only to do so—and then so—so—so—and then so—so—so—and\r\n      then so—so—and then—”\r\n\r\n      “Mon dieu! Ma’m’selle Salsafette!” here cried a dozen voices at\r\n      once. “What are you about?—forbear!—that is sufficient!—we see,\r\n      very plainly, how it is done!—hold! hold!” and several persons\r\n      were already leaping from their seats to withhold Ma’m’selle\r\n      Salsafette from putting herself upon a par with the Medicean\r\n      Venus, when the point was very effectually and suddenly\r\n      accomplished by a series of loud screams, or yells, from some\r\n      portion of the main body of the _château_.\r\n\r\n      My nerves were very much affected, indeed, by these yells; but\r\n      the rest of the company I really pitied. I never saw any set of\r\n      reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life. They all\r\n      grew as pale as so many corpses, and, shrinking within their\r\n      seats, sat quivering and gibbering with terror, and listening for\r\n      a repetition of the sound. It came again—louder and seemingly\r\n      nearer—and then a third time very loud, and then a fourth time\r\n      with a vigor evidently diminished. At this apparent dying away of\r\n      the noise, the spirits of the company were immediately regained,\r\n      and all was life and anecdote as before. I now ventured to\r\n      inquire the cause of the disturbance.\r\n\r\n      “A mere _bagatelle_,” said Monsieur Maillard. “We are used to\r\n      these things, and care really very little about them. The\r\n      lunatics, every now and then, get up a howl in concert; one\r\n      starting another, as is sometimes the case with a bevy of dogs at\r\n      night. It occasionally happens, however, that the _concerto_\r\n      yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose;\r\n      when, of course, some little danger is to be apprehended.”\r\n\r\n      “And how many have you in charge?”\r\n\r\n      “At present we have not more than ten, altogether.”\r\n\r\n      “Principally females, I presume?”\r\n\r\n      “Oh, no—every one of them men, and stout fellows, too, I can tell\r\n      you.”\r\n\r\n      “Indeed! I have always understood that the majority of lunatics\r\n      were of the gentler sex.”\r\n\r\n      “It is generally so, but not always. Some time ago, there were\r\n      about twenty-seven patients here; and, of that number, no less\r\n      than eighteen were women; but, lately, matters have changed very\r\n      much, as you see.”\r\n\r\n      “Yes—have changed very much, as you see,” here interrupted the\r\n      gentleman who had broken the shins of Ma’m’selle Laplace.\r\n\r\n      “Yes—have changed very much, as you see!” chimed in the whole\r\n      company at once.\r\n\r\n      “Hold your tongues, every one of you!” said my host, in a great\r\n      rage. Whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for\r\n      nearly a minute. As for one lady, she obeyed Monsieur Maillard to\r\n      the letter, and thrusting out her tongue, which was an\r\n      excessively long one, held it very resignedly, with both hands,\r\n      until the end of the entertainment.\r\n\r\n      “And this gentlewoman,” said I, to Monsieur Maillard, bending\r\n      over and addressing him in a whisper—“this good lady who has just\r\n      spoken, and who gives us the cock-a-doodle-de-doo—she, I presume,\r\n      is harmless—quite harmless, eh?”\r\n\r\n      “Harmless!” ejaculated he, in unfeigned surprise, “why—why, what\r\n      can you mean?”\r\n\r\n      “Only slightly touched?” said I, touching my head. “I take it for\r\n      granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected,\r\n      eh?”\r\n\r\n      “_Mon dieu!_ what is it you imagine? This lady, my particular old\r\n      friend Madame Joyeuse, is as absolutely sane as myself. She has\r\n      her little eccentricities, to be sure—but then, you know, all old\r\n      women—all _very_ old women—are more or less eccentric!”\r\n\r\n      “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure—and then the rest of these\r\n      ladies and gentlemen—”\r\n\r\n      “Are my friends and keepers,” interupted Monsieur Maillard,\r\n      drawing himself up with _hauteur_,—“my very good friends and\r\n      assistants.”\r\n\r\n      “What! all of them?” I asked,—“the women and all?”\r\n\r\n      “Assuredly,” he said,—“we could not do at all without the women;\r\n      they are the best lunatic nurses in the world; they have a way of\r\n      their own, you know; their bright eyes have a marvellous\r\n      effect—something like the fascination of the snake, you know.”\r\n\r\n      “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure! They behave a little odd,\r\n      eh?—they are a little queer, eh?—don’t you think so?”\r\n\r\n      “Odd!—queer!—why, do you really think so? We are not very\r\n      prudish, to be sure, here in the South—do pretty much as we\r\n      please—enjoy life, and all that sort of thing, you know—”\r\n\r\n      “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure.”\r\n\r\n      “And then, perhaps, this Clos de Vougeot is a little heady, you\r\n      know—a little strong—you understand, eh?”\r\n\r\n      “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure. By the bye, Monsieur, did I\r\n      understand you to say that the system you have adopted, in place\r\n      of the celebrated soothing system, was one of very rigorous\r\n      severity?”\r\n\r\n      “By no means. Our confinement is necessarily close; but the\r\n      treatment—the medical treatment, I mean—is rather agreeable to\r\n      the patients than otherwise.”\r\n\r\n      “And the new system is one of your own invention?”\r\n\r\n      “Not altogether. Some portions of it are referable to Professor\r\n      Tarr, of whom you have, necessarily, heard; and, again, there are\r\n      modifications in my plan which I am happy to acknowledge as\r\n      belonging of right to the celebrated Fether, with whom, if I\r\n      mistake not, you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n      “I am quite ashamed to confess,” I replied, “that I have never\r\n      even heard the names of either gentleman before.”\r\n\r\n      “Good heavens!” ejaculated my host, drawing back his chair\r\n      abruptly, and uplifting his hands. “I surely do not hear you\r\n      aright! You did not intend to say, eh? that you had never heard\r\n      either of the learned Doctor Tarr, or of the celebrated Professor\r\n      Fether?”\r\n\r\n      “I am forced to acknowledge my ignorance,” I replied; “but the\r\n      truth should be held inviolate above all things. Nevertheless, I\r\n      feel humbled to the dust, not to be acquainted with the works of\r\n      these, no doubt, extraordinary men. I will seek out their\r\n      writings forthwith, and peruse them with deliberate care.\r\n      Monsieur Maillard, you have really—I must confess it—you have\r\n      really—made me ashamed of myself!”\r\n\r\n      And this was the fact.\r\n\r\n      “Say no more, my good young friend,” he said kindly, pressing my\r\n      hand,—“join me now in a glass of Sauterne.”\r\n\r\n      We drank. The company followed our example without stint. They\r\n      chatted—they jested—they laughed—they perpetrated a thousand\r\n      absurdities—the fiddles shrieked—the drum row-de-dowed—the\r\n      trombones bellowed like so many brazen bulls of Phalaris—and the\r\n      whole scene, growing gradually worse and worse, as the wines\r\n      gained the ascendancy, became at length a sort of pandemonium in\r\n      petto. In the meantime, Monsieur Maillard and myself, with some\r\n      bottles of Sauterne and Vougeot between us, continued our\r\n      conversation at the top of the voice. A word spoken in an\r\n      ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice\r\n      of a fish from the bottom of Niagara Falls.\r\n\r\n      “And, sir,” said I, screaming in his ear, “you mentioned\r\n      something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old\r\n      system of soothing. How is that?”\r\n\r\n      “Yes,” he replied, “there was, occasionally, very great danger\r\n      indeed. There is no accounting for the caprices of madmen; and,\r\n      in my opinion as well as in that of Dr. Tarr and Professor\r\n      Fether, it is never safe to permit them to run at large\r\n      unattended. A lunatic may be ‘soothed,’ as it is called, for a\r\n      time, but, in the end, he is very apt to become obstreperous. His\r\n      cunning, too, is proverbial and great. If he has a project in\r\n      view, he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom; and the\r\n      dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity, presents, to the\r\n      metaphysician, one of the most singular problems in the study of\r\n      mind. When a madman appears thoroughly sane, indeed, it is high\r\n      time to put him in a straitjacket.”\r\n\r\n      “But the danger, my dear sir, of which you were speaking, in your\r\n      own experience—during your control of this house—have you had\r\n      practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a\r\n      lunatic?”\r\n\r\n      “Here?—in my own experience?—why, I may say, yes. For example:—no\r\n      very long while ago, a singular circumstance occurred in this\r\n      very house. The ‘soothing system,’ you know, was then in\r\n      operation, and the patients were at large. They behaved\r\n      remarkably well—especially so—any one of sense might have known\r\n      that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact,\r\n      that the fellows behaved so remarkably well. And, sure enough,\r\n      one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and\r\n      foot, and thrown into the cells, where they were attended, as if\r\n      they were the lunatics, by the lunatics themselves, who had\r\n      usurped the offices of the keepers.”\r\n\r\n      “You don’t tell me so! I never heard of any thing so absurd in my\r\n      life!”\r\n\r\n      “Fact—it all came to pass by means of a stupid fellow—a\r\n      lunatic—who, by some means, had taken it into his head that he\r\n      had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of\r\n      before—of lunatic government, I mean. He wished to give his\r\n      invention a trial, I suppose, and so he persuaded the rest of the\r\n      patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the\r\n      reigning powers.”\r\n\r\n      “And he really succeeded?”\r\n\r\n      “No doubt of it. The keepers and kept were soon made to exchange\r\n      places. Not that exactly either—for the madmen had been free, but\r\n      the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith, and treated, I am\r\n      sorry to say, in a very cavalier manner.”\r\n\r\n      “But I presume a counter-revolution was soon effected. This\r\n      condition of things could not have long existed. The country\r\n      people in the neighborhood—visitors coming to see the\r\n      establishment—would have given the alarm.”\r\n\r\n      “There you are out. The head rebel was too cunning for that. He\r\n      admitted no visitors at all—with the exception, one day, of a\r\n      very stupid-looking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to\r\n      be afraid. He let him in to see the place—just by way of\r\n      variety,—to have a little fun with him. As soon as he had\r\n      gammoned him sufficiently, he let him out, and sent him about his\r\n      business.”\r\n\r\n      “And how long, then, did the madmen reign?”\r\n\r\n      “Oh, a very long time, indeed—a month certainly—how much longer I\r\n      can’t precisely say. In the meantime, the lunatics had a jolly\r\n      season of it—that you may swear. They doffed their own shabby\r\n      clothes, and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels. The\r\n      cellars of the château were well stocked with wine; and these\r\n      madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it. They lived\r\n      well, I can tell you.”\r\n\r\n      “And the treatment—what was the particular species of treatment\r\n      which the leader of the rebels put into operation?”\r\n\r\n      “Why, as for that, a madman is not necessarily a fool, as I have\r\n      already observed; and it is my honest opinion that his treatment\r\n      was a much better treatment than that which it superseded. It was\r\n      a very capital system indeed—simple—neat—no trouble at all—in\r\n      fact it was delicious—it was—”\r\n\r\n      Here my host’s observations were cut short by another series of\r\n      yells, of the same character as those which had previously\r\n      disconcerted us. This time, however, they seemed to proceed from\r\n      persons rapidly approaching.\r\n\r\n      “Gracious heavens!” I ejaculated—“the lunatics have most\r\n      undoubtedly broken loose.”\r\n\r\n      “I very much fear it is so,” replied Monsieur Maillard, now\r\n      becoming excessively pale. He had scarcely finished the sentence,\r\n      before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the\r\n      windows; and, immediately afterward, it became evident that some\r\n      persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room.\r\n      The door was beaten with what appeared to be a sledge-hammer, and\r\n      the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence.\r\n\r\n      A scene of the most terrible confusion ensued. Monsieur Maillard,\r\n      to my excessive astonishment threw himself under the side-board.\r\n      I had expected more resolution at his hands. The members of the\r\n      orchestra, who, for the last fifteen minutes, had been seemingly\r\n      too much intoxicated to do duty, now sprang all at once to their\r\n      feet and to their instruments, and, scrambling upon their table,\r\n      broke out, with one accord, into, “Yankee Doodle,” which they\r\n      performed, if not exactly in tune, at least with an energy\r\n      superhuman, during the whole of the uproar.\r\n\r\n      Meantime, upon the main dining-table, among the bottles and\r\n      glasses, leaped the gentleman who, with such difficulty, had been\r\n      restrained from leaping there before. As soon as he fairly\r\n      settled himself, he commenced an oration, which, no doubt, was a\r\n      very capital one, if it could only have been heard. At the same\r\n      moment, the man with the teetotum predilection, set himself to\r\n      spinning around the apartment, with immense energy, and with arms\r\n      outstretched at right angles with his body; so that he had all\r\n      the air of a tee-totum in fact, and knocked everybody down that\r\n      happened to get in his way. And now, too, hearing an incredible\r\n      popping and fizzing of champagne, I discovered at length, that it\r\n      proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that\r\n      delicate drink during dinner. And then, again, the frog-man\r\n      croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every\r\n      note that he uttered. And, in the midst of all this, the\r\n      continuous braying of a donkey arose over all. As for my old\r\n      friend, Madame Joyeuse, I really could have wept for the poor\r\n      lady, she appeared so terribly perplexed. All she did, however,\r\n      was to stand up in a corner, by the fireplace, and sing out\r\n      incessantly at the top of her voice, “Cock-a-doodle-de-dooooooh!”\r\n\r\n      And now came the climax—the catastrophe of the drama. As no\r\n      resistance, beyond whooping and yelling and cock-a-doodling, was\r\n      offered to the encroachments of the party without, the ten\r\n      windows were very speedily, and almost simultaneously, broken in.\r\n      But I shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with\r\n      which I gazed, when, leaping through these windows, and down\r\n      among us _pêle-mêle_, fighting, stamping, scratching, and\r\n      howling, there rushed a perfect army of what I took to be\r\n      chimpanzees, ourang-outangs, or big black baboons of the Cape of\r\n      Good Hope.\r\n\r\n      I received a terrible beating—after which I rolled under a sofa\r\n      and lay still. After lying there some fifteen minutes, during\r\n      which time I listened with all my ears to what was going on in\r\n      the room, I came to same satisfactory _dénouement_ of this\r\n      tragedy. Monsieur Maillard, it appeared, in giving me the account\r\n      of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion, had been\r\n      merely relating his own exploits. This gentleman had, indeed,\r\n      some two or three years before, been the superintendent of the\r\n      establishment, but grew crazy himself, and so became a patient.\r\n      This fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced\r\n      me. The keepers, ten in number, having been suddenly overpowered,\r\n      were first well tarred, then carefully feathered, and then shut\r\n      up in underground cells. They had been so imprisoned for more\r\n      than a month, during which period Monsieur Maillard had\r\n      generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers (which\r\n      constituted his “system”), but some bread and abundance of water.\r\n      The latter was pumped on them daily. At length, one escaping\r\n      through a sewer, gave freedom to all the rest.\r\n\r\n      The “soothing system,” with important modifications, has been\r\n      resumed at the _château;_ yet I cannot help agreeing with\r\n      Monsieur Maillard, that his own “treatment” was a very capital\r\n      one of its kind. As he justly observed, it was “simple—neat—and\r\n      gave no trouble at all—not the least.”\r\n\r\n      I have only to add that, although I have searched every library\r\n      in Europe for the works of Doctor _Tarr_ and Professor _Fether_,\r\n      I have, up to the present day, utterly failed in my endeavors at\r\n      procuring an edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITERARY LIFE OF THINGUM BOB, ESQ.\r\n\r\nLATE EDITOR OF THE “GOOSETHERUMFOODLE.”\r\nBy Himself\r\n\r\n\r\n      I am now growing in years, and—since I understand that\r\n      Shakespeare and Mr. Emmons are deceased—it is not impossible that\r\n      I may even die. It has occurred to me, therefore, that I may as\r\n      well retire from the field of Letters and repose upon my laurels.\r\n      But I am ambitious of signalizing my abdication of the literary\r\n      sceptre by some important bequest to posterity; and, perhaps, I\r\n      cannot do a better thing than just pen for it an account of my\r\n      earlier career. My name, indeed, has been so long and so\r\n      constantly before the public eye, that I am not only willing to\r\n      admit the naturalness of the interest which it has everywhere\r\n      excited, but ready to satisfy the extreme curiosity which it has\r\n      inspired. In fact, it is no more than the duty of him who\r\n      achieves greatness to leave behind him, in his ascent, such\r\n      landmarks as may guide others to be great. I propose, therefore,\r\n      in the present paper, (which I had some idea of calling\r\n      “Memoranda to serve for the Literary History of America,”) to\r\n      give a detail of those important, yet feeble and tottering first\r\n      steps, by which, at length, I attained the high road to the\r\n      pinnacle of human renown.\r\n\r\n      Of one’s very remote ancestors it is superfluous to say much. My\r\n      father, Thomas Bob, Esq., stood for many years at the summit of\r\n      his profession, which was that of a merchant-barber, in the city\r\n      of Smug. His warehouse was the resort of all the principal people\r\n      of the place, and especially of the editorial corps—a body which\r\n      inspires all about it with profound veneration and awe. For my\r\n      own part, I regarded them as gods, and drank in with avidity the\r\n      rich wit and wisdom which continuously flowed from their august\r\n      mouths during the process of what is styled “lather.” My first\r\n      moment of positive inspiration must be dated from that\r\n      ever-memorable epoch, when the brilliant conductor of the\r\n      “Gad-Fly,” in the intervals of the important process just\r\n      mentioned, recited aloud, before a conclave of our apprentices,\r\n      an inimitable poem in honor of the “Only Genuine Oil-of-Bob,” (so\r\n      called from its talented inventor, my father,) and for which\r\n      effusion the editor of the “Fly” was remunerated with a regal\r\n      liberality by the firm of Thomas Bob & company, merchant-barbers.\r\n\r\n      The genius of the stanzas to the “Oil-of-Bob” first breathed into\r\n      me, I say, the divine _afflatus_. I resolved at once to become a\r\n      great man, and to commence by becoming a great poet. That very\r\n      evening I fell upon my knees at the feet of my father.\r\n\r\n      “Father,” I said, “pardon me!—but I have a soul above lather. It\r\n      is my firm intention to cut the shop. I would be an editor—I\r\n      would be a poet—I would pen stanzas to the ‘Oil-of-Bob.’ Pardon\r\n      me and aid me to be great!”\r\n\r\n      “My dear Thingum,” replied my father, (I had been christened\r\n      Thingum after a wealthy relative so surnamed,) “My dear Thingum,”\r\n      he said, raising me from my knees by the ears—“Thingum, my boy,\r\n      you’re a trump, and take after your father in having a soul. You\r\n      have an immense head, too, and it must hold a great many brains.\r\n      This I have long seen, and therefore had thoughts of making you a\r\n      lawyer. The business, however, has grown ungenteel, and that of a\r\n      politician don’t pay. Upon the whole you judge wisely;—the trade\r\n      of editor is best:—and if you can be a poet at the same time,—as\r\n      most of the editors are, by the by,—why you will kill two birds\r\n      with one stone. To encourage you in the beginning of things, I\r\n      will allow you a garret; pen, ink, and paper; a rhyming\r\n      dictionary; and a copy of the ‘Gad-Fly.’ I suppose you would\r\n      scarcely demand any more.”\r\n\r\n      “I would be an ungrateful villain if I did,” I replied with\r\n      enthusiasm. “Your generosity is boundless. I will repay it by\r\n      making you the father of a genius.”\r\n\r\n      Thus ended my conference with the best of men, and immediately\r\n      upon its termination, I betook myself with zeal to my poetical\r\n      labors; as upon these, chiefly, I founded my hopes of ultimate\r\n      elevation to the editorial chair.\r\n\r\n      In my first attempts at composition I found the stanzas to “The\r\n      Oil-of-Bob” rather a draw-back than otherwise. Their splendor\r\n      more dazzled than enlightened me. The contemplation of their\r\n      excellence tended, naturally, to discourage me by comparison with\r\n      my own abortions; so that for a long time I labored in vain. At\r\n      length there came into my head one of those exquisitely original\r\n      ideas which now and then _will_ permeate the brain of a man of\r\n      genius. It was this:—or, rather, thus was it carried into\r\n      execution. From the rubbish of an old book-stall, in a very\r\n      remote corner of the town, I got together several antique and\r\n      altogether unknown or forgotten volumes. The bookseller sold them\r\n      to me for a song. From one of these, which purported to be a\r\n      translation of one Dante’s “Inferno,” I copied with remarkable\r\n      neatness a long passage about a man named Ugolino, who had a\r\n      parcel of brats. From another which contained a good many old\r\n      plays by some person whose name I forget, I extracted in the same\r\n      manner, and with the same care, a great number of lines about\r\n      “angels” and “ministers saying grace,” and “goblins damned,” and\r\n      more besides of that sort. From a third, which was the\r\n      composition of some blind man or other, either a Greek or a\r\n      Choctaw—I cannot be at the pains of remembering every trifle\r\n      exactly—I took about fifty verses beginning with “Achilles’\r\n      wrath,” and “grease,” and something else. From a fourth, which I\r\n      recollect was also the work of a blind man, I selected a page or\r\n      two all about “hail” and “holy light”; and although a blind man\r\n      has no business to write about light, still the verses were\r\n      sufficiently good in their way.\r\n\r\n      Having made fair copies of these poems, I signed every one of\r\n      them “Oppodeldoc,” (a fine sonorous name,) and, doing each up\r\n      nicely in a separate envelope, I despatched one to each of the\r\n      four principal Magazines, with a request for speedy insertion and\r\n      prompt pay. The result of this well conceived plan, however, (the\r\n      success of which would have saved me much trouble in after life,)\r\n      served to convince me that some editors are not to be bamboozled,\r\n      and gave the _coup-de-grace_ (as they say in France,) to my\r\n      nascent hopes, (as they say in the city of the transcendentals.)\r\n\r\n      The fact is, that each and every one of the Magazines in\r\n      question, gave Mr. “Oppodeldoc” a complete using-up, in the\r\n      “Monthly Notices to Correspondents.” The “Hum-Drum” gave him a\r\n      dressing after this fashion:\r\n\r\n      “‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has sent us a long _tirade_\r\n      concerning a bedlamite whom he styles ‘Ugolino,’ who had a great\r\n      many children that should have been all whipped and sent to bed\r\n      without their suppers. The whole affair is exceedingly tame—not\r\n      to say _flat_. ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is entirely devoid\r\n      of imagination—and imagination, in our humble opinion, is not\r\n      only the soul of Poesy, but also its very heart. ‘Oppodeldoc,’\r\n      (whoever he is,) has the audacity to demand of us, for his\r\n      twattle, a ‘speedy insertion and prompt pay.’ We neither insert\r\n      nor purchase any stuff of the sort. There can be no doubt,\r\n      however, that he would meet with a ready sale for all the\r\n      balderdash he can scribble, at the office of either the\r\n      ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle.’”\r\n\r\n      All this, it must be acknowledged, was very severe upon\r\n      “Oppodeldoc”—but the unkindest cut was putting the word Poesy in\r\n      small caps. In those five pre-eminent letters what a world of\r\n      bitterness is there not involved!\r\n\r\n      But “Oppodeldoc” was punished with equal severity in the\r\n      “Rowdy-Dow,” which spoke thus:\r\n\r\n      “We have received a most singular and insolent communication from\r\n      a person (whoever he is,) signing himself ‘Oppodeldoc’—thus\r\n      desecrating the greatness of the illustrious Roman Emperor so\r\n      named. Accompanying the letter of ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,)\r\n      we find sundry lines of most disgusting and unmeaning rant about\r\n      ‘angels and ministers of grace’—rant such as no madman short of a\r\n      Nat Lee, or an ‘Oppodeldoc,’ could possibly perpetrate. And for\r\n      this trash of trash, we are modestly requested to ‘pay promptly.’\r\n      No sir—no! We pay for nothing of _that_ sort. Apply to the\r\n      ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle.’ These\r\n      _periodicals_ will undoubtedly accept any literary offal you may\r\n      send them—and as undoubtedly _promise_ to pay for it.”\r\n\r\n      This was bitter indeed upon poor “Oppodeldoc”; but, in this\r\n      instance, the weight of the satire falls upon the “Hum-drum,” the\r\n      “Lollipop,” and the “Goosetherumfoodle,” who are pungently styled\r\n      “_periodicals_”—in Italics, too—a thing that must have cut them\r\n      to the heart.\r\n\r\n      Scarcely less savage was the “Lollipop,” which thus discoursed:\r\n\r\n      “Some _individual_, who rejoices in the appellation ‘Oppodeldoc,’\r\n      (to what low uses are the names of the illustrious dead too often\r\n      applied!) has enclosed us some fifty or sixty _verses_ commencing\r\n      after this fashion:\r\n\r\n      Achilles’ wrath, to Greece the direful spring\r\n      Of woes unnumbered, &c., &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\n      “‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is respectfully informed that\r\n      there is not a printer’s devil in our office who is not in the\r\n      daily habit of composing better _lines_. Those of ‘Oppodeldoc’\r\n      will not _scan_. ‘Oppodeldoc’ should learn to _count_. But why he\r\n      should have conceived the idea that _we_, (of all others, _we!_)\r\n      would disgrace our pages with his ineffable nonsense, is utterly\r\n      beyond comprehension. Why, the absurd twattle is scarcely good\r\n      enough for the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ the\r\n      ‘Goosetherumfoodle’—things that are in the practice of publishing\r\n      ‘Mother Goose’s Melodies’ as original lyrics. And ‘Oppodeldoc’\r\n      (whoever he is,) has even the assurance to demand _pay_ for this\r\n      drivel. Does ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) know—is he aware that\r\n      we could not be paid to insert it?”\r\n\r\n      As I perused this I felt myself growing gradually smaller and\r\n      smaller, and when I came to the point at which the editor sneered\r\n      at the poem as “verses” there was little more than an ounce of me\r\n      left. As for “Oppodeldoc,” I began to experience _compassion_ for\r\n      the poor fellow. But the “Goosetherumfoodle” showed, if possible,\r\n      less mercy than the “Lollipop.” It was the “Goosetherumfoodle”\r\n      that said:\r\n\r\n      “A wretched poetaster, who signs himself ‘Oppodeldoc,’ is silly\r\n      enough to fancy that _we_ will print and _pay for_ a medley of\r\n      incoherent and ungrammatical bombast which he has transmitted to\r\n      us, and which commences with the following most _intelligible_\r\n      line:\r\n\r\n      ‘Hail, Holy Light! Offspring of Heaven, first born.’\r\n\r\n      “We say, ‘most _intelligible_.’ ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,)\r\n      will be kind enough to tell us, perhaps, how ‘_hail_’ can be\r\n      ‘_holy light_’ We always regarded it as _frozen rain_. Will he\r\n      inform us, also, how frozen rain can be, at one and the same\r\n      time, both ‘holy light,’ (whatever that is,) and an\r\n      ‘offspring?’—which latter term, (if we understand any thing about\r\n      English,) is only employed, with propriety, in reference to small\r\n      babies of about six weeks old. But it is preposterous to descant\r\n      upon such absurdity—although ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has\r\n      the unparalleled effrontery to suppose that we will not only\r\n      ‘insert’ his ignorant ravings, but (absolutely) _pay for them!_\r\n\r\n      “Now this is fine—it is rich!—and we have half a mind to punish\r\n      this young scribbler for his egotism, by really publishing his\r\n      effusion, _verbatim et literatim_, as he has written it. We could\r\n      inflict no punishment so severe, and we _would_ inflict it, but\r\n      for the boredom which we should cause our readers in so doing.\r\n\r\n      “Let ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) send any future _composition_\r\n      of like character to the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the\r\n      ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ _They_ will ‘insert’ it. _They_ ‘insert’ every month\r\n      just such stuff. Send it to them. WE are not to be insulted with\r\n      impunity.”\r\n\r\n      This made an end of me; and as for the “Hum-Drum,” the\r\n      “Rowdy-Dow,” and the “Lollipop,” I never could comprehend how\r\n      they survived it. The putting _them_ in the smallest possible\r\n      _minion_, (that was the rub—thereby insinuating their\r\n      lowness—their baseness,) while WE stood looking down upon them in\r\n      gigantic capitals!—oh it was _too_ bitter!—it was wormwood—it was\r\n      gall. Had I been either of these periodicals I would have spared\r\n      no pains to have the “Goosetherumfoodle” prosecuted. It might\r\n      have been done under the Act for the “Prevention of Cruelty to\r\n      Animals.” As for “Oppodeldoc,” (whoever he was), I had by this\r\n      time lost all patience with the fellow, and sympathized with him\r\n      no longer. He was a fool, beyond doubt, (whoever he was,) and got\r\n      not a kick more than he deserved.\r\n\r\n      The result of my experiment with the old books, convinced me, in\r\n      the first place, that “honesty is the best policy,” and, in the\r\n      second, that if I could not write better than Mr. Dante, and the\r\n      two blind men, and the rest of the old set, it would, at least,\r\n      be a difficult matter to write worse. I took heart, therefore,\r\n      and determined to prosecute the “entirely original,” (as they say\r\n      on the covers of the magazines,) at whatever cost of study and\r\n      pains. I again placed before my eyes, as a model, the brilliant\r\n      stanzas on “The Oil-of-Bob” by the editor of the “Gad-Fly,” and\r\n      resolved to construct an ode on the same sublime theme, in\r\n      rivalry of what had already been done.\r\n\r\n      With my first verse I had no material difficulty. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n      “To pen an Ode upon the ‘Oil-of-Bob.’”\r\n\r\n      Having carefully looked out, however, all the legitimate rhymes\r\n      to “Bob,” I found it impossible to proceed. In this dilemma I had\r\n      recourse to paternal aid; and, after some hours of mature\r\n      thought, my father and myself thus constructed the poem:\r\n\r\n      _“To pen an Ode upon the ‘Oil-of-Bob’\r\n      Is all sorts of a job._\r\n                          “(Signed) Snob.”\r\n\r\n      To be sure, this composition was of no very great length—but I\r\n      “have yet to learn” as they say in the Edinburgh Review, that the\r\n      mere extent of a literary work has any thing to do with its\r\n      merit. As for the Quarterly cant about “sustained effort,” it is\r\n      impossible to see the sense of it. Upon the whole, therefore, I\r\n      was satisfied with the success of my maiden attempt, and now the\r\n      only question regarded the disposal I should make of it. My\r\n      father suggested that I should send it to the “Gad-Fly”—but there\r\n      were two reasons which operated to prevent me from so doing. I\r\n      dreaded the jealousy of the editor—and I had ascertained that he\r\n      did not pay for original contributions. I therefore, after due\r\n      deliberation, consigned the article to the more dignified pages\r\n      of the “Lollipop,” and awaited the event in anxiety, but with\r\n      resignation.\r\n\r\n      In the very next published number I had the proud satisfaction of\r\n      seeing my poem printed at length, as the leading article, with\r\n      the following significant words, prefixed in italics and between\r\n      brackets:\r\n\r\n      _We call the attention of our readers to the subjoined admirable\r\n      stanza on “The Oil of Bob.” We need say nothing of their\r\n      sublimity, or their pathos:—it is impossible to peruse them\r\n      without tears. Those who have been nauseated with a sad dose on\r\n      the same august topic from the goose quill of the editor of the\r\n      “Gad Fly” will do well to compare the two compositions._\r\n\r\n      P. S.—We are consumed with anxiety to probe the mystery which\r\n      envelops the evident pseudonym “Snob.” May we hope for a personal\r\n      interview?\r\n\r\n      All this was scarcely more than justice, but it was, I confess,\r\n      rather more than I had expected:—I acknowledged this, be it\r\n      observed, to the everlasting disgrace of my country and of\r\n      mankind. I lost no time, however, in calling upon the editor of\r\n      the “Lollipop,” and had the good fortune to find this gentleman\r\n      at home. He saluted me with an air of profound respect, slightly\r\n      blended with a fatherly and patronizing admiration, wrought in\r\n      him, no doubt, by my appearance of extreme youth and\r\n      inexperience. Begging me to be seated, he entered at once upon\r\n      the subject of my poem;—but modesty will ever forbid me to repeat\r\n      the thousand compliments which he lavished upon me. The eulogies\r\n      of Mr. Crab, (such was the editor’s name,) were, however, by no\r\n      means fulsomely indiscriminate. He analyzed my composition with\r\n      much freedom and great ability—not hesitating to point out a few\r\n      trivial defects—a circumstance which elevated him highly in my\r\n      esteem. The “Gad-Fly” was, of course, brought upon the _tapis_,\r\n      and I hope never to be subjected to a criticism so searching, or\r\n      to rebukes so withering, as were bestowed by Mr. Crab upon that\r\n      unhappy effusion. I had been accustomed to regard the editor of\r\n      the “Gad-Fly” as something superhuman; but Mr. Crab soon\r\n      disabused me of that idea. He set the literary as well as the\r\n      personal character of the Fly (so Mr. C. satirically designated\r\n      the rival editor,) in its true light. He, the Fly, was very\r\n      little better than he should be. He had written infamous things.\r\n      He was a penny-a-liner, and a buffoon. He was a villain. He had\r\n      composed a tragedy which set the whole country in a guffaw, and a\r\n      farce which deluged the universe in tears. Besides all this, he\r\n      had the impudence to pen what he meant for a lampoon upon\r\n      himself, (Mr. Crab,) and the temerity to style him “an ass.”\r\n      Should I at any time wish to express my opinion of Mr. Fry, the\r\n      pages of the “Lollipop,” Mr. Crab assured me, were at my\r\n      unlimited disposal. In the meantime, as it was very certain that\r\n      I would be attacked in the Fly for my attempt at composing a\r\n      rival poem on the “Oil-of-Bob,” he (Mr. Crab,) would take it upon\r\n      himself to attend, pointedly, to my private and personal\r\n      interests. If I were not made a man of at once, it should not be\r\n      the fault of himself, (Mr. Crab.)\r\n\r\n      Mr. Crab having now paused in his discourse, (the latter portion\r\n      of which I found it impossible to comprehend,) I ventured to\r\n      suggest something about the remuneration which I had been taught\r\n      to expect for my poem, by an announcement on the cover of the\r\n      “Lollipop,” declaring that it, (the “Lollipop,”) “insisted upon\r\n      being permitted to pay exorbitant prices for all accepted\r\n      contributions—frequently expending more money for a single brief\r\n      poem than the whole annual cost of the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the\r\n      ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ and the ‘Goosetherumfoodle’ combined.”\r\n\r\n      As I mentioned the word “remuneration,” Mr. Crab first opened his\r\n      eyes, and then his mouth, to quite a remarkable extent; causing\r\n      his personal appearance to resemble that of a highly-agitated\r\n      elderly duck in the act of quacking; and in this condition he\r\n      remained, (ever and anon pressing his hands tightly to his\r\n      forehead, as if in a state of desperate bewilderment) until I had\r\n      nearly made an end of what I had to say.\r\n\r\n      Upon my conclusion, he sank back into his seat, as if much\r\n      overcome, letting his arms fall lifelessly by his side, but\r\n      keeping his mouth still rigorously open, after the fashion of the\r\n      duck. While I remained in speechless astonishment at behavior so\r\n      alarming, he suddenly leaped to his feet and made a rush at the\r\n      bell-rope; but just as he reached this, he appeared to have\r\n      altered his intention, whatever it was, for he dived under a\r\n      table and immediately re-appeared with a cudgel. This he was in\r\n      the act of uplifting, (for what purpose I am at a loss to\r\n      imagine,) when, all at once, there came a benign smile over his\r\n      features, and he sank placidly back in his chair.\r\n\r\n      “Mr. Bob,” he said, (for I had sent up my card before ascending\r\n      myself,) “Mr. Bob, you are a young man, I presume—_very?_”\r\n\r\n      I assented; adding that I had not yet concluded my third lustrum.\r\n\r\n      “Ah!” he replied, “very good! I see how it is—say no more!\r\n      Touching this matter of compensation, what you observe is very\r\n      just: in fact it is excessively so. But ah—ah—the _first_\r\n      contribution—the _first_, I say,—it is never the Magazine custom\r\n      to pay for—you comprehend, eh? The truth is, we are usually the\r\n      _recipients_ in such case.” [Mr. Crab smiled blandly as he\r\n      emphasized the word “recipients.”] “For the most part, we are\r\n      _paid_ for the insertion of a maiden attempt—especially in verse.\r\n      In the second place, Mr. Bob, the Magazine rule is never to\r\n      disburse what we term in France the _argent comptant_—I have no\r\n      doubt you understand. In a quarter or two after publication of\r\n      the article—or in a year or two—we make no objection to giving\r\n      our note at nine months; provided always that we can so arrange\r\n      our affairs as to be quite certain of a ‘burst up’ in six. I\r\n      really _do_ hope, Mr. Bob, that you will look upon this\r\n      explanation as satisfactory.” Here Mr. Crab concluded, and the\r\n      tears stood in his eyes.\r\n\r\n      Grieved to the soul at having been, however innocently, the cause\r\n      of pain to so eminent and so sensitive a man, I hastened to\r\n      apologize, and to reassure him, by expressing my perfect\r\n      coincidence with his views, as well as my entire appreciation of\r\n      the delicacy of his position. Having done all this in a neat\r\n      speech, I took leave.\r\n\r\n      One fine morning, very shortly afterwards, “I awoke and found\r\n      myself famous.” The extent of my renown will be best estimated by\r\n      reference to the editorial opinions of the day. These opinions,\r\n      it will be seen, were embodied in critical notices of the number\r\n      of the “Lollipop” containing my poem, and are perfectly\r\n      satisfactory, conclusive and clear with the exception, perhaps,\r\n      of the hieroglyphical marks, “_Sep_. 15—1 t.” appended to each of\r\n      the critiques.\r\n\r\n      The “Owl,” a journal of profound sagacity, and well known for the\r\n      deliberate gravity of its literary decisions—the “Owl,” I say,\r\n      spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n      “‘The Lollipop!’ The October number of this delicious Magazine\r\n      surpasses its predecessors, and sets competition at defiance. In\r\n      the beauty of its typography and paper—in the number and\r\n      excellence of its steel plates—as well as in the literary merit\r\n      of its contributions—the ‘Lollipop’ compares with its slow-paced\r\n      rivals as Hyperion with a Satyr. The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’\r\n      and the ‘Goosetherumfoodle,’ excel, it is true, in braggadocio,\r\n      but, in all other points, give us the ‘Lollipop!’ How this\r\n      celebrated journal can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses,\r\n      is more than we can understand. To be sure, it has a circulation\r\n      of 100,000, and its subscription-list has increased one-fourth\r\n      during the last month; but, on the other hand, the sums it\r\n      disburses constantly for contributions are inconceivable. It is\r\n      reported that Mr. Slyass received no less than thirty-seven and a\r\n      half cents for his inimitable paper on ‘Pigs.’ With Mr. Crab, as\r\n      editor, and with such names upon the list of contributors as Snob\r\n      and Slyass, there can be no such word as ‘fail’ for the\r\n      Lollipop.’ Go and subscribe. _Sep_. 15—1 _t.”_\r\n\r\n      I must say that I was gratified with this high-toned notice from\r\n      a paper so respectable as the “Owl.” The placing my name—that is\r\n      to say, my _nom de guerre_—in priority of station to that of the\r\n      great Slyass, was a compliment as happy as I felt it to be\r\n      deserved.\r\n\r\n      My attention was next arrested by these paragraphs in the\r\n      “Toad”—a print highly distinguished for its uprightness, and\r\n      independence—for its entire freedom from sycophancy and\r\n      subservience to the givers of dinners:\r\n\r\n      “The ‘Lollipop’ for October is out in advance of all its\r\n      contemporaries, and infinitely surpasses them, of course, in the\r\n      splendor of its embellishments, as well as in the richness of its\r\n      literary contents. The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ and the\r\n      ‘Goosetherumfoodle’ excel, we admit, in braggadocio, but, in all\r\n      other points, give us the ‘Lollipop. How this celebrated Magazine\r\n      can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we\r\n      can understand. To be sure, it has a circulation of 200,000, and\r\n      its subscription list has increased one-third during the last\r\n      fortnight, but on the other hand, the sums it disburses, monthly,\r\n      for contributions, are fearfully great. We learn that Mr.\r\n      Mumblethumb received no less than fifty cents for his late\r\n      ‘Monody in a Mud-Puddle.’\r\n\r\n      “Among the original contributors to the present number we notice,\r\n      (besides the eminent editor, Mr. Crab,) such men as Snob, Slyass,\r\n      and Mumblethumb. Apart from the editorial matter, the most\r\n      valuable paper, nevertheless, is, we think, a poetical gem by\r\n      Snob, on the ‘Oil-of-Bob’—but our readers must not suppose from\r\n      the title of this incomparable _bijou_, that it bears any\r\n      similitude to some balderdash on the same subject by a certain\r\n      contemptible individual whose name is unmentionable to ears\r\n      polite. The present poem ‘On the Oil-of-Bob,’ has excited\r\n      universal anxiety and curiosity in respect to the owner of the\r\n      evident pseudonym, ‘Snob’—a curiosity which, happily, we have it\r\n      in our power to satisfy. ‘Snob’ is the nom de plume of Mr.\r\n      Thingum Bob, of this city,—a relative of the great Mr. Thingum,\r\n      (after whom he is named,) and otherwise connected with the most\r\n      illustrious families of the State. His father, Thomas Bob, Esq.,\r\n      is an opulent merchant in Smug. _Sep_. 15—1 _t.”_\r\n\r\n      This generous approbation touched me to the heart—the more\r\n      especially as it emanated from a source so avowedly—so\r\n      proverbially pure as the “Toad.” The word “balderdash,” as\r\n      applied to the “Oil-of-Bob” of the Fly, I considered singularly\r\n      pungent and appropriate. The words “gem” and “_bijou_,” however,\r\n      used in reference to my composition, struck me as being, in some\r\n      degree, feeble, and seemed to me to be deficient in force. They\r\n      were not sufficiently _prononcés_, (as we have it in France).\r\n\r\n      I had hardly finished reading the “Toad,” when a friend placed in\r\n      my hands a copy of the “Mole,” a daily, enjoying high reputation\r\n      for the keenness of its perception about matters in general, and\r\n      for the open, honest, above-ground style of its editorials. The\r\n      “Mole” spoke of the “Lollipop” as follows:\r\n\r\n      “We have just received the ‘Lollipop’ for October, and must say\r\n      that never before have we perused any single number of any\r\n      periodical which afforded us a felicity so supreme. We speak\r\n      advisedly. The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow’ and the\r\n      ‘Goosetherumfoodle’ must look well to their laurels. These\r\n      prints, no doubt, surpass every thing in loudness of pretension,\r\n      but, in all other points, give us the ‘Lollipop!’ How this\r\n      celebrated Magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous\r\n      expenses, is more than we can comprehend. To be sure, it has a\r\n      circulation of 300,000 and its subscription-list has increased\r\n      one-half within the last week, but then the sum it disburses,\r\n      monthly, for contributions, is astoundingly enormous. We have it\r\n      upon good authority, that Mr. Fatquack received no less than\r\n      sixty-two cents and a half for his late domestic nouvelette, the\r\n      ‘Dish-Clout.’\r\n\r\n      “The contributors to the number before us are Mr. Crab, (the\r\n      eminent editor,) Snob, Mumblethumb, Fatquack, and others; but,\r\n      after the inimitable compositions of the editor himself, we\r\n      prefer a diamond-like effusion from the pen of a rising poet who\r\n      writes over the signature ‘Snob’—a nom de guerre which we predict\r\n      will one day extinguish the radiance of ‘Boz.’ ‘Snob,’ we learn,\r\n      is a Mr. Thingum Bob, Esq., sole heir of a wealthy merchant of\r\n      this city, Thomas Bob, Esq., and a near relative of the\r\n      distinguished Mr. Thingum. The title of Mr. B.‘s admirable poem\r\n      is the ‘Oil-of-Bob’—a somewhat unfortunate name, by-the-by, as\r\n      some contemptible vagabond connected with the penny press has\r\n      already disgusted the town with a great deal of drivel upon the\r\n      same topic. There will be no danger, however, of confounding the\r\n      compositions. Sep. 15—1 t.”\r\n\r\n      The generous approbation of so clear-sighted a journal as the\r\n      “Mole” penetrated my soul with delight. The only objection which\r\n      occurred to me was, that the terms “contemptible vagabond” might\r\n      have been better written “_odious and_ contemptible _wretch,\r\n      villain and_ vagabond.” This would have sounded more gracefully,\r\n      I think. “Diamond-like,” also, was scarcely, it will be admitted,\r\n      of sufficient intensity to express what the “Mole” evidently\r\n      _thought_ of the brilliancy of the “Oil-of-Bob.”\r\n\r\n      On the same afternoon in which I saw these notices in the “Owl,”\r\n      the “Toad,” and the “Mole” I happened to meet with a copy of the\r\n      “Daddy-Long-Legs,” a periodical proverbial for the extreme extent\r\n      of its understanding. And it was the “Daddy-Long-Legs” which\r\n      spoke thus:\r\n\r\n      “The ‘Lollipop!!’ This gorgeous magazine is already before the\r\n      public for October. The question of preeminence is forever put to\r\n      rest, and hereafter it will be excessively preposterous in the\r\n      ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle,’ to make\r\n      any farther spasmodic attempts at competition. These journals may\r\n      excel the ‘Lollipop’ in outcry, but, in all other points, give us\r\n      the ‘Lollipop!’ How this celebrated Magazine can sustain its\r\n      evidently tremendous expenses, is past comprehension. To be sure\r\n      it has a circulation of precisely half a million, and its\r\n      subscription-list has increased seventy-five per cent, within the\r\n      last couple of days; but then the sums it disburses, monthly, for\r\n      contributions, are scarcely credible; we are cognizant of the\r\n      fact, that Mademoiselle Cribalittle received no less than\r\n      eighty-seven cents and a half for her late valuable Revolutionary\r\n      Tale, entitled ‘The York-Town Katy-Did, and the Bunker-Hill\r\n      Katy-Didn’t.’\r\n\r\n      “The most able papers in the present number, are, of course,\r\n      those furnished by the editor, (the eminent Mr. Crab,) but there\r\n      are numerous magnificent contributions from such names as Snob,\r\n      Mademoiselle Cribalittle, Slyass, Mrs. Fibalittle, Mumblethumb,\r\n      Mrs. Squibalittle, and last, though not least, Fatquack. The\r\n      world may well be challenged to produce so rich a galaxy of\r\n      genius.\r\n\r\n      “The poem over the signature ‘Snob’ is, we find, attracting\r\n      universal commendation, and, we are constrained to say, deserves,\r\n      if possible, even more applause than it has received. The\r\n      ‘Oil-of-Bob’ is the title of this masterpiece of eloquence and\r\n      art. One or two of our readers _may_ have a _very_ faint,\r\n      although sufficiently disgusting recollection of a poem (?)\r\n      similarly entitled, the perpetration of a miserable\r\n      penny-a-liner, mendicant, and cut-throat, connected in the\r\n      capacity of scullion, we believe, with one of the indecent prints\r\n      about the purlieus of the city; we beg them, for God’s sake, not\r\n      to confound the compositions. The author of the ‘Oil-of-Bob’ is,\r\n      we hear, Thingum Bob, Esq., a gentleman of high genius, and a\r\n      scholar. ‘Snob’ is merely a _nom-de-guerre. Sept_. 15—1 _t.”_\r\n\r\n      I could scarcely restrain my indignation while I perused the\r\n      concluding portions of this diatribe. It was clear to me that the\r\n      yea-nay manner—not to say the gentleness—the positive forbearance\r\n      with which the “Daddy-Long-Legs” spoke of that pig, the editor of\r\n      the “Gad-Fly”—it was evident to me, I say, that this gentleness\r\n      of speech could proceed from nothing else than a partiality for\r\n      the Fly—whom it was clearly the intention of the\r\n      “Daddy-Long-Legs” to elevate into reputation at my expense. Any\r\n      one, indeed, might perceive, with half an eye, that, had the real\r\n      design of the “Daddy” been what it wished to appear, it, (the\r\n      “Daddy”) might have expressed itself in terms more direct, more\r\n      pungent, and altogether more to the purpose. The words\r\n      “penny-a-liner,” “mendicant,” “scullion,” and “cut-throat,” were\r\n      epithets so intentionally inexpressive and equivocal, as to be\r\n      worse than nothing when applied to the author of the very worst\r\n      stanzas ever penned by one of the human race. We all know what is\r\n      meant by “damning with faint praise,” and, on the other hand, who\r\n      could fail seeing through the covert purpose of the “Daddy”—that\r\n      of glorifying with feeble abuse?\r\n\r\n      What the “Daddy” chose to say of the Fly, however, was no\r\n      business of mine. What it said of myself _was_. After the noble\r\n      manner in which the “Owl,” the “Toad,” the “Mole,” had expressed\r\n      themselves in respect to my ability, it was rather too much to be\r\n      coolly spoken of by a thing like the “Daddy-Long-Legs,” as merely\r\n      “a gentleman of high genius and a scholar.” Gentleman indeed! I\r\n      made up my mind at once, either to get a written apology from the\r\n      “Daddy-Long-Legs,” or to call it out.\r\n\r\n      Full of this purpose, I looked about me to find a friend whom I\r\n      could entrust with a message to his Daddyship, and as the editor\r\n      of the “Lollipop” had given me marked tokens of regard, I at\r\n      length concluded to seek assistance upon the present occasion.\r\n\r\n      I have never yet been able to account, in a manner satisfactory\r\n      to my own understanding, for the _very_ peculiar countenance and\r\n      demeanor with which Mr. Crab listened to me, as I unfolded to him\r\n      my design. He again went through the scene of the bell-rope and\r\n      cudgel, and did not omit the duck. At one period I thought he\r\n      really intended to quack. His fit, nevertheless, finally subsided\r\n      as before, and he began to act and speak in a rational way. He\r\n      declined bearing the cartel, however, and in fact, dissuaded me\r\n      from sending it at all; but was candid enough to admit that the\r\n      “Daddy-Long-Legs” had been disgracefully in the wrong—more\r\n      especially in what related to the epithets “gentleman and\r\n      scholar.”\r\n\r\n      Towards the end of this interview with Mr. Crab, who really\r\n      appeared to take a paternal interest in my welfare, he suggested\r\n      to me that I might turn an honest penny, and, at the same time,\r\n      advance my reputation, by occasionally playing Thomas Hawk for\r\n      the “Lollipop.”\r\n\r\n      I begged Mr. Crab to inform me who was Mr. Thomas Hawk, and how\r\n      it was expected that I should play him.\r\n\r\n      Here Mr. Crab again “made great eyes,” (as we say in Germany,)\r\n      but at length, recovering himself from a profound attack of\r\n      astonishment, he assured me that he employed the words “Thomas\r\n      Hawk” to avoid the colloquialism, Tommy, which was low—but that\r\n      the true idea was Tommy Hawk—or tomahawk—and that by “playing\r\n      tomahawk” he referred to scalping, brow-beating and otherwise\r\n      using-up the herd of poor-devil authors.\r\n\r\n      I assured my patron that, if this was all, I was perfectly\r\n      resigned to the task of playing Thomas Hawk. Hereupon Mr. Crab\r\n      desired me to use-up the editor of the “Gad-Fly” forthwith, in\r\n      the fiercest style within the scope of my ability, and as a\r\n      specimen of my powers. This I did, upon the spot, in a review of\r\n      the original “Oil-of-Bob,” occupying thirty-six pages of the\r\n      “Lollipop.” I found playing Thomas Hawk, indeed, a far less\r\n      onerous occupation than poetizing; for I went upon _system_\r\n      altogether, and thus it was easy to do the thing thoroughly and\r\n      well. My practice was this. I bought auction copies (cheap) of\r\n      “Lord Brougham’s Speeches,” “Cobbett’s Complete Works,” the “New\r\n      Slang-Syllabus,” the “Whole Art of Snubbing,” “Prentice’s\r\n      Billingsgate” (folio edition,) and “Lewis G. Clarke on Tongue.”\r\n      These works I cut up thoroughly with a currycomb, and then,\r\n      throwing the shreds into a sieve, sifted out carefully all that\r\n      might be thought decent, (a mere trifle); reserving the hard\r\n      phrases, which I threw into a large tin pepper-castor with\r\n      longitudinal holes, so that an entire sentence could get through\r\n      without material injury. The mixture was then ready for use. When\r\n      called upon to play Thomas Hawk, I anointed a sheet of fools-cap\r\n      with the white of a gander’s egg; then, shredding the thing to be\r\n      reviewed as I had previously shredded the books,—only with more\r\n      care, so as to get every word separate—I threw the latter shreds\r\n      in with the former, screwed on the lid of the castor, gave it a\r\n      shake, and so dusted out the mixture upon the egged foolscap;\r\n      where it stuck. The effect was beautiful to behold. It was\r\n      captivating. Indeed, the reviews I brought to pass by this simple\r\n      expedient have never been approached, and were the wonder of the\r\n      world. At first, through bashfulness—the result of inexperience—I\r\n      was a little put out by a certain inconsistency—a certain air of\r\n      the _bizarre_, (as we say in France,) worn by the composition as\r\n      a whole. All the phrases did not _fit_, (as we say in the\r\n      Anglo-Saxon). Many were quite awry. Some, even, were\r\n      up-side-down; and there were none of them which were not, in some\r\n      measure, injured in regard to effect, by this latter species of\r\n      accident, when it occurred—with the exception of Mr. Lewis\r\n      Clarke’s paragraphs, which were so vigorous, and altogether\r\n      stout, that they seemed not particularly disconcerted by any\r\n      extreme of position, but looked equally happy and satisfactory,\r\n      whether on their heads, or on their heels.\r\n\r\n      What became of the editor of the “Gad-Fly,” after the publication\r\n      of my criticism on his “Oil-of-Bob,” it is somewhat difficult to\r\n      determine. The most reasonable conclusion is, that he wept\r\n      himself to death. At all events he disappeared instantaneously\r\n      from the face of the earth, and no man has seen even the ghost of\r\n      him since.\r\n\r\n      This matter having been properly accomplished, and the Furies\r\n      appeased, I grew at once into high favor with Mr. Crab. He took\r\n      me into his confidence, gave me a permanent situation as Thomas\r\n      Hawk of the “Lollipop,” and, as for the present, he could afford\r\n      me no salary, allowed me to profit, at discretion, by his advice.\r\n\r\n      “My dear Thingum,” said he to me one day after dinner, “I respect\r\n      your abilities and love you as a son. You shall be my heir. When\r\n      I die I will bequeath you the ‘Lollipop.’ In the meantime I will\r\n      make a man of you—I _will_—provided always that you follow my\r\n      counsel. The first thing to do is to get rid of the old bore.”\r\n\r\n      “Boar?” said I inquiringly—“pig, eh?—_aper?_ (as we say in\r\n      Latin)—who?—where?”\r\n\r\n      “Your father,” said he.\r\n\r\n      “Precisely,” I replied,—“pig.”\r\n\r\n      “You have your fortune to make, Thingum,” resumed Mr. Crab, “and\r\n      that governor of yours is a millstone about your neck. We must\r\n      cut him at once.” [Here I took out my knife.] “We must cut him,”\r\n      continued Mr. Crab, “decidedly and forever. He won’t do—he\r\n      _won’t_. Upon second thoughts, you had better kick him, or cane\r\n      him, or something of that kind.”\r\n\r\n      “What do you say,” I suggested modestly, “to my kicking him in\r\n      the first instance, caning him afterwards, and winding up by\r\n      tweaking his nose?”\r\n\r\n      Mr. Crab looked at me musingly for some moments, and then\r\n      answered:\r\n\r\n      “I think, Mr. Bob, that what you propose would answer\r\n      sufficiently well—indeed remarkably well—that is to say, as far\r\n      as it went—but barbers are exceedingly hard to cut, and I think,\r\n      upon the whole, that, having performed upon Thomas Bob the\r\n      operations you suggest, it would be advisable to blacken, with\r\n      your fists, both his eyes, very carefully and thoroughly, to\r\n      prevent his ever seeing you again in fashionable promenades.\r\n      After doing this, I really do not perceive that you can do any\r\n      more. However—it might be just as well to roll him once or twice\r\n      in the gutter, and then put him in charge of the police. Any time\r\n      the next morning you can call at the watch-house and swear an\r\n      assault.”\r\n\r\n      I was much affected by the kindness of feeling towards me\r\n      personally, which was evinced in this excellent advice of Mr.\r\n      Crab, and I did not fail to profit by it forthwith. The result\r\n      was, that I got rid of the old bore, and began to feel a little\r\n      independent and gentleman-like. The want of money, however, was,\r\n      for a few weeks, a source of some discomfort; but at length, by\r\n      carefully putting to use my two eyes, and observing how matters\r\n      went just in front of my nose, I perceived how the thing was to\r\n      be brought about. I say “thing”—be it observed—for they tell me\r\n      the Latin for it is _rem_. By the way, talking of Latin, can any\r\n      one tell me the meaning of _quocunque_—or what is the meaning of\r\n      _modo?_\r\n\r\n      My plan was exceedingly simple. I bought, for a song, a sixteenth\r\n      of the “Snapping-Turtle”:—that was all. The thing was _done_, and\r\n      I put money in my purse. There were some trivial arrangements\r\n      afterwards, to be sure; but these formed no portion of the plan.\r\n      They were a consequence—a result. For example, I bought pen, ink,\r\n      and paper, and put them into furious activity. Having thus\r\n      completed a Magazine article, I gave it, for appellation,\r\n      “Fol-Lol, _by the Author of_ ‘The Oil-of-Bob,’” and enveloped it\r\n      to the “Goosetherumfoodle.” That journal, however, having\r\n      pronounced it “twattle” in the “Monthly Notices to\r\n      Correspondents,” I reheaded the paper “‘Hey-Diddle-Diddle,’ by\r\n      Thingum Bob, Esq., Author of the Ode on ‘The Oil-of-Bob,’ _and_\r\n      Editor of the ‘Snapping-Turtle.’” With this amendment, I\r\n      re-enclosed it to the “Goosetherumfoodle,” and, while I awaited a\r\n      reply, published daily, in the “Turtle,” six columns of what may\r\n      be termed philosophical and analytical investigation of the\r\n      literary merits of the “Goosetherumfoodle,” as well as of the\r\n      personal character of the editor of the “Goosetherumfoodle.” At\r\n      the end of a week the “Goosetherumfoodle” discovered that it had,\r\n      by some odd mistake, “confounded a stupid article, headed\r\n      ‘Hey-Diddle-Diddle’ and composed by some unknown ignoramus, with\r\n      a gem of resplendent lustre similarly entitled, the work of\r\n      Thingum Bob, Esq., the celebrated author of ‘The Oil-of-Bob.’”\r\n      The “Goosetherumfoodle” deeply “regretted this very natural\r\n      accident,” and promised, moreover, an insertion of the _genuine_\r\n      “Hey-Diddle-Diddle” in the very next number of the Magazine.\r\n\r\n      The fact is, I _thought_—I _really_ thought—I thought at the\r\n      time—I thought _then_—and have no reason for thinking otherwise\r\n      _now_—that the “Goosetherumfoodle” _did_ make a mistake. With the\r\n      best intentions in the world, I never knew any thing that made as\r\n      many singular mistakes as the “Goosetherumfoodle.” From that day\r\n      I took a liking to the “Goosetherumfoodle,” and the result was I\r\n      soon saw into the very depths of its literary merits, and did not\r\n      fail to expatiate upon them, in the “Turtle,” whenever a fitting\r\n      opportunity occurred. And it is to be regarded as a very peculiar\r\n      coincidence—as one of those positively _remarkable_ coincidences\r\n      which set a man to serious thinking—that just such a total\r\n      revolution of opinion—just such entire _bouleversement_, (as we\r\n      say in French,)—just such thorough _topsiturviness_, (if I may be\r\n      permitted to employ a rather forcible term of the Choctaws,) as\r\n      happened, _pro_ and _con_, between myself on the one part, and\r\n      the “Goosetherumfoodle” on the other, did actually again happen,\r\n      in a brief period afterwards, and with precisely similar\r\n      circumstances, in the case of myself and the “Rowdy-Dow,” and in\r\n      the case of myself and the “Hum-Drum.”\r\n\r\n      Thus it was that, by a master-stroke of genius, I at length\r\n      consummated my triumphs by “putting money in my purse,” and thus\r\n      may be said really and fairly to have commenced that brilliant\r\n      and eventful career which rendered me illustrious, and which now\r\n      enables me to say, with Chateaubriand, “I have made\r\n      history”—“_J’ai fait l’histoire_.”\r\n\r\n      I have indeed “made history.” From the bright epoch which I now\r\n      record, my actions—my works—are the property of mankind. They are\r\n      familiar to the world. It is, then, needless for me to detail\r\n      how, soaring rapidly, I fell heir to the “Lollipop”—how I merged\r\n      this journal in the “Hum-Drum”—how again I made purchase of the\r\n      “Rowdy-Dow,” thus combining the three periodicals—how, lastly, I\r\n      effected a bargain for the sole remaining rival, and united all\r\n      the literature of the country in one magnificent Magazine, known\r\n      everywhere as the\r\n\r\n      “Rowdy-Dow, Lollipop, Hum-Drum,\r\n      and\r\n      goosetherumfoodle.”\r\n\r\n      Yes; I have made history. My fame is universal. It extends to the\r\n      uttermost ends of the earth. You cannot take up a common\r\n      newspaper in which you shall not see some allusion to the\r\n      immortal Thingum Bob. It is Mr. Thingum Bob said so, and Mr.\r\n      Thingum Bob wrote this, and Mr. Thingum Bob did that. But I am\r\n      meek and expire with an humble heart. After all, what is it?—this\r\n      indescribable something which men will persist in terming\r\n      “genius?” I agree with Buffon—with Hogarth—it is but _diligence_\r\n      after all.\r\n\r\n      Look at _me!_—how I labored—how I toiled—how I wrote! Ye Gods,\r\n      did I _not_ write? I knew not the word “ease.” By day I adhered\r\n      to my desk, and at night, a pale student, I consumed the midnight\r\n      oil. You should have seen me—you _should_. I leaned to the right.\r\n      I leaned to the left. I sat forward. I sat backward. I sat upon\r\n      end. I sat _tete baissée_, (as they have it in the Kickapoo,)\r\n      bowing my head close to the alabaster page. And, through all,\r\n      I—_wrote_. Through joy and through sorrow, I—_wrote_. Through\r\n      hunger and through thirst, I—_wrote_. Through good report and\r\n      through ill report, I—_wrote_. Through sunshine and through\r\n      moonshine, I—_wrote. What_ I wrote it is unnecessary to say. The\r\n      _style!_—that was the thing. I caught it from\r\n      Fatquack—whizz!—fizz!—— and I am giving you a specimen of it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO WRITE A “BLACKWOOD” ARTICLE\r\n\r\n\r\n      “In the name of the Prophet—figs!!”\r\n                    —_Cry of the Turkish fig-peddler._\r\n\r\n      I presume everybody has heard of me. My name is the Signora\r\n      Psyche Zenobia. This I know to be a fact. Nobody but my enemies\r\n      ever calls me Suky Snobbs. I have been assured that Suky is but a\r\n      vulgar corruption of Psyche, which is good Greek, and means “the\r\n      soul” (that’s me, I’m all soul) and sometimes “a butterfly,”\r\n      which latter meaning undoubtedly alludes to my appearance in my\r\n      new crimson satin dress, with the sky-blue Arabian mantelet, and\r\n      the trimmings of green agraffas, and the seven flounces of\r\n      orange-colored auriculas. As for Snobbs—any person who should\r\n      look at me would be instantly aware that my name wasn’t Snobbs.\r\n      Miss Tabitha Turnip propagated that report through sheer envy.\r\n      Tabitha Turnip indeed! Oh the little wretch! But what can we\r\n      expect from a turnip? Wonder if she remembers the old adage about\r\n      “blood out of a turnip,” &c.? [Mem. put her in mind of it the\r\n      first opportunity.] [Mem. again—pull her nose.] Where was I? Ah!\r\n      I have been assured that Snobbs is a mere corruption of Zenobia,\r\n      and that Zenobia was a queen—(So am I. Dr. Moneypenny always\r\n      calls me the Queen of the Hearts)—and that Zenobia, as well as\r\n      Psyche, is good Greek, and that my father was “a Greek,” and that\r\n      consequently I have a right to our patronymic, which is Zenobia\r\n      and not by any means Snobbs. Nobody but Tabitha Turnip calls me\r\n      Suky Snobbs. I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia.\r\n\r\n      As I said before, everybody has heard of me. I am that very\r\n      Signora Psyche Zenobia, so justly celebrated as corresponding\r\n      secretary to the “Philadelphia, Regular, Exchange, Tea, Total,\r\n      Young, Belles, Lettres, Universal, Experimental, Bibliographical,\r\n      Association, To, Civilize, Humanity.” Dr. Moneypenny made the\r\n      title for us, and says he chose it because it sounded big like an\r\n      empty rum-puncheon. (A vulgar man that sometimes—but he’s deep.)\r\n      We all sign the initials of the society after our names, in the\r\n      fashion of the R. S. A., Royal Society of Arts—the S. D. U. K.,\r\n      Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, &c, &c. Dr.\r\n      Moneypenny says that S. stands for stale, and that D. U. K.\r\n      spells duck, (but it don’t,) that S. D. U. K. stands for Stale\r\n      Duck and not for Lord Brougham’s society—but then Dr. Moneypenny\r\n      is such a queer man that I am never sure when he is telling me\r\n      the truth. At any rate we always add to our names the initials P.\r\n      R. E. T. T. Y. B. L. U. E. B. A. T. C. H.—that is to say,\r\n      Philadelphia, Regular, Exchange, Tea, Total, Young, Belles,\r\n      Lettres, Universal, Experimental, Bibliographical, Association,\r\n      To, Civilize, Humanity—one letter for each word, which is a\r\n      decided improvement upon Lord Brougham. Dr. Moneypenny will have\r\n      it that our initials give our true character—but for my life I\r\n      can’t see what he means.\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding the good offices of the Doctor, and the strenuous\r\n      exertions of the association to get itself into notice, it met\r\n      with no very great success until I joined it. The truth is, the\r\n      members indulged in too flippant a tone of discussion. The papers\r\n      read every Saturday evening were characterized less by depth than\r\n      buffoonery. They were all whipped syllabub. There was no\r\n      investigation of first causes, first principles. There was no\r\n      investigation of any thing at all. There was no attention paid to\r\n      that great point, the “fitness of things.” In short there was no\r\n      fine writing like this. It was all low—very! No profundity, no\r\n      reading, no metaphysics—nothing which the learned call\r\n      spirituality, and which the unlearned choose to stigmatize as\r\n      cant. [Dr. M. says I ought to spell “cant” with a capital K—but I\r\n      know better.]\r\n\r\n      When I joined the society it was my endeavor to introduce a\r\n      better style of thinking and writing, and all the world knows how\r\n      well I have succeeded. We get up as good papers now in the P. R.\r\n      E. T. T. Y. B. L. U. E. B. A. T. C. H. as any to be found even in\r\n      Blackwood. I say, Blackwood, because I have been assured that the\r\n      finest writing, upon every subject, is to be discovered in the\r\n      pages of that justly celebrated Magazine. We now take it for our\r\n      model upon all themes, and are getting into rapid notice\r\n      accordingly. And, after all, it’s not so very difficult a matter\r\n      to compose an article of the genuine Blackwood stamp, if one only\r\n      goes properly about it. Of course I don’t speak of the political\r\n      articles. Everybody knows how they are managed, since Dr.\r\n      Moneypenny explained it. Mr. Blackwood has a pair of\r\n      tailor’s-shears, and three apprentices who stand by him for\r\n      orders. One hands him the “Times,” another the “Examiner” and a\r\n      third a “Culley’s New Compendium of Slang-Whang.” Mr. B. merely\r\n      cuts out and intersperses. It is soon done—nothing but\r\n      “Examiner,” “Slang-Whang,” and “Times”—then “Times,”\r\n      “Slang-Whang,” and “Examiner”—and then “Times,” “Examiner,” and\r\n      “Slang-Whang.”\r\n\r\n      But the chief merit of the Magazine lies in its miscellaneous\r\n      articles; and the best of these come under the head of what Dr.\r\n      Moneypenny calls the bizarreries (whatever that may mean) and\r\n      what everybody else calls the intensities. This is a species of\r\n      writing which I have long known how to appreciate, although it is\r\n      only since my late visit to Mr. Blackwood (deputed by the\r\n      society) that I have been made aware of the exact method of\r\n      composition. This method is very simple, but not so much so as\r\n      the politics. Upon my calling at Mr. B.‘s, and making known to\r\n      him the wishes of the society, he received me with great\r\n      civility, took me into his study, and gave me a clear explanation\r\n      of the whole process.\r\n\r\n      “My dear madam,” said he, evidently struck with my majestic\r\n      appearance, for I had on the crimson satin, with the green\r\n      agraffas, and orange-colored auriclas. “My dear madam,” said he,\r\n      “sit down. The matter stands thus: In the first place your writer\r\n      of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big pen, with\r\n      a very blunt nib. And, mark me, Miss Psyche Zenobia!” he\r\n      continued, after a pause, with the most expressive energy and\r\n      solemnity of manner, “mark me!—that pen—must—never be mended!\r\n      Herein, madam, lies the secret, the soul, of intensity. I assume\r\n      upon myself to say, that no individual, of however great genius\r\n      ever wrote with a good pen—understand me,—a good article. You may\r\n      take, it for granted, that when manuscript can be read it is\r\n      never worth reading. This is a leading principle in our faith, to\r\n      which if you cannot readily assent, our conference is at an end.”\r\n\r\n      He paused. But, of course, as I had no wish to put an end to the\r\n      conference, I assented to a proposition so very obvious, and one,\r\n      too, of whose truth I had all along been sufficiently aware. He\r\n      seemed pleased, and went on with his instructions.\r\n\r\n      “It may appear invidious in me, Miss Psyche Zenobia, to refer you\r\n      to any article, or set of articles, in the way of model or study,\r\n      yet perhaps I may as well call your attention to a few cases. Let\r\n      me see. There was ‘The Dead Alive,’ a capital thing!—the record\r\n      of a gentleman’s sensations when entombed before the breath was\r\n      out of his body—full of tastes, terror, sentiment, metaphysics,\r\n      and erudition. You would have sworn that the writer had been born\r\n      and brought up in a coffin. Then we had the ‘Confessions of an\r\n      Opium-eater’—fine, very fine!—glorious imagination—deep\r\n      philosophy acute speculation—plenty of fire and fury, and a good\r\n      spicing of the decidedly unintelligible. That was a nice bit of\r\n      flummery, and went down the throats of the people delightfully.\r\n      They would have it that Coleridge wrote the paper—but not so. It\r\n      was composed by my pet baboon, Juniper, over a rummer of Hollands\r\n      and water, ‘hot, without sugar.’” [This I could scarcely have\r\n      believed had it been anybody but Mr. Blackwood, who assured me of\r\n      it.] “Then there was ‘The Involuntary Experimentalist,’ all about\r\n      a gentleman who got baked in an oven, and came out alive and\r\n      well, although certainly done to a turn. And then there was ‘The\r\n      Diary of a Late Physician,’ where the merit lay in good rant, and\r\n      indifferent Greek—both of them taking things with the public. And\r\n      then there was ‘The Man in the Bell,’ a paper by-the-by, Miss\r\n      Zenobia, which I cannot sufficiently recommend to your attention.\r\n      It is the history of a young person who goes to sleep under the\r\n      clapper of a church bell, and is awakened by its tolling for a\r\n      funeral. The sound drives him mad, and, accordingly, pulling out\r\n      his tablets, he gives a record of his sensations. Sensations are\r\n      the great things after all. Should you ever be drowned or hung,\r\n      be sure and make a note of your sensations—they will be worth to\r\n      you ten guineas a sheet. If you wish to write forcibly, Miss\r\n      Zenobia, pay minute attention to the sensations.”\r\n\r\n      “That I certainly will, Mr. Blackwood,” said I.\r\n\r\n      “Good!” he replied. “I see you are a pupil after my own heart.\r\n      But I must put you au fait to the details necessary in composing\r\n      what may be denominated a genuine Blackwood article of the\r\n      sensation stamp—the kind which you will understand me to say I\r\n      consider the best for all purposes.\r\n\r\n      “The first thing requisite is to get yourself into such a scrape\r\n      as no one ever got into before. The oven, for instance,—that was\r\n      a good hit. But if you have no oven or big bell, at hand, and if\r\n      you cannot conveniently tumble out of a balloon, or be swallowed\r\n      up in an earthquake, or get stuck fast in a chimney, you will\r\n      have to be contented with simply imagining some similar\r\n      misadventure. I should prefer, however, that you have the actual\r\n      fact to bear you out. Nothing so well assists the fancy, as an\r\n      experimental knowledge of the matter in hand. ‘Truth is strange,’\r\n      you know, ‘stranger than fiction’—besides being more to the\r\n      purpose.”\r\n\r\n      Here I assured him I had an excellent pair of garters, and would\r\n      go and hang myself forthwith.\r\n\r\n      “Good!” he replied, “do so;—although hanging is somewhat\r\n      hacknied. Perhaps you might do better. Take a dose of Brandreth’s\r\n      pills, and then give us your sensations. However, my instructions\r\n      will apply equally well to any variety of misadventure, and in\r\n      your way home you may easily get knocked in the head, or run over\r\n      by an omnibus, or bitten by a mad dog, or drowned in a gutter.\r\n      But to proceed.\r\n\r\n      “Having determined upon your subject, you must next consider the\r\n      tone, or manner, of your narration. There is the tone didactic,\r\n      the tone enthusiastic, the tone natural—all commonplace enough.\r\n      But then there is the tone laconic, or curt, which has lately\r\n      come much into use. It consists in short sentences. Somehow thus:\r\n      Can’t be too brief. Can’t be too snappish. Always a full stop.\r\n      And never a paragraph.\r\n\r\n      “Then there is the tone elevated, diffusive, and interjectional.\r\n      Some of our best novelists patronize this tone. The words must be\r\n      all in a whirl, like a humming-top, and make a noise very\r\n      similar, which answers remarkably well instead of meaning. This\r\n      is the best of all possible styles where the writer is in too\r\n      great a hurry to think.\r\n\r\n      “The tone metaphysical is also a good one. If you know any big\r\n      words this is your chance for them. Talk of the Ionic and Eleatic\r\n      schools—of Archytas, Gorgias, and Alcmaeon. Say something about\r\n      objectivity and subjectivity. Be sure and abuse a man named\r\n      Locke. Turn up your nose at things in general, and when you let\r\n      slip any thing a little too absurd, you need not be at the\r\n      trouble of scratching it out, but just add a footnote and say\r\n      that you are indebted for the above profound observation to the\r\n      ‘Kritik der reinem Vernunft,’ or to the ‘Metaphysithe\r\n      Anfongsgrunde der Noturwissenchaft.’ This would look erudite\r\n      and—and—and frank.\r\n\r\n      “There are various other tones of equal celebrity, but I shall\r\n      mention only two more—the tone transcendental and the tone\r\n      heterogeneous. In the former the merit consists in seeing into\r\n      the nature of affairs a very great deal farther than anybody\r\n      else. This second sight is very efficient when properly managed.\r\n      A little reading of the ‘Dial’ will carry you a great way.\r\n      Eschew, in this case, big words; get them as small as possible,\r\n      and write them upside down. Look over Channing’s poems and quote\r\n      what he says about a ‘fat little man with a delusive show of\r\n      Can.’ Put in something about the Supernal Oneness. Don’t say a\r\n      syllable about the Infernal Twoness. Above all, study innuendo.\r\n      Hint everything—assert nothing. If you feel inclined to say\r\n      ‘bread and butter,’ do not by any means say it outright. You may\r\n      say any thing and every thing approaching to ‘bread and butter.’\r\n      You may hint at buck-wheat cake, or you may even go so far as to\r\n      insinuate oat-meal porridge, but if bread and butter be your real\r\n      meaning, be cautious, my dear Miss Psyche, not on any account to\r\n      say ‘bread and butter!’”\r\n\r\n      I assured him that I should never say it again as long as I\r\n      lived. He kissed me and continued:\r\n\r\n      “As for the tone heterogeneous, it is merely a judicious mixture,\r\n      in equal proportions, of all the other tones in the world, and is\r\n      consequently made up of every thing deep, great, odd, piquant,\r\n      pertinent, and pretty.\r\n\r\n      “Let us suppose now you have determined upon your incidents and\r\n      tone. The most important portion—in fact, the soul of the whole\r\n      business, is yet to be attended to—I allude to the filling up. It\r\n      is not to be supposed that a lady, or gentleman either, has been\r\n      leading the life of a book worm. And yet above all things it is\r\n      necessary that your article have an air of erudition, or at least\r\n      afford evidence of extensive general reading. Now I’ll put you in\r\n      the way of accomplishing this point. See here!” (pulling down\r\n      some three or four ordinary-looking volumes, and opening them at\r\n      random). “By casting your eye down almost any page of any book in\r\n      the world, you will be able to perceive at once a host of little\r\n      scraps of either learning or _bel-esprit-ism_, which are the very\r\n      thing for the spicing of a Blackwood article. You might as well\r\n      note down a few while I read them to you. I shall make two\r\n      divisions: first, Piquant Facts for the Manufacture of Similes,\r\n      and, second, Piquant Expressions to be introduced as occasion may\r\n      require. Write now!”—and I wrote as he dictated.\r\n\r\n      “PIQUANT FACTS FOR SIMILES. ‘There were originally but three\r\n      Muses—Melete, Mneme, Aœde—meditation, memory, and singing.’ You\r\n      may make a good deal of that little fact if properly worked. You\r\n      see it is not generally known, and looks _recherché_. You must be\r\n      careful and give the thing with a downright improviso air.\r\n\r\n      “Again. ‘The river Alpheus passed beneath the sea, and emerged\r\n      without injury to the purity of its waters.’ Rather stale that,\r\n      to be sure, but, if properly dressed and dished up, will look\r\n      quite as fresh as ever.\r\n\r\n      “Here is something better. ‘The Persian Iris appears to some\r\n      persons to possess a sweet and very powerful perfume, while to\r\n      others it is perfectly scentless.’ Fine that, and very delicate!\r\n      Turn it about a little, and it will do wonders. We’ll have some\r\n      thing else in the botanical line. There’s nothing goes down so\r\n      well, especially with the help of a little Latin. Write!\r\n\r\n      “‘_The Epidendrum Flos Aeris_, of Java, bears a very beautiful\r\n      flower, and will live when pulled up by the roots. The natives\r\n      suspend it by a cord from the ceiling, and enjoy its fragrance\r\n      for years.’ That’s capital! That will do for the similes. Now for\r\n      the Piquant Expressions.\r\n\r\n      “PIQUANT EXPRESSIONS. ‘_The Venerable Chinese novel Ju-Kiao-Li_.’\r\n      Good! By introducing these few words with dexterity you will\r\n      evince your intimate acquaintance with the language and\r\n      literature of the Chinese. With the aid of this you may either\r\n      get along without either Arabic, or Sanscrit, or Chickasaw. There\r\n      is no passing muster, however, without Spanish, Italian, German,\r\n      Latin, and Greek. I must look you out a little specimen of each.\r\n      Any scrap will answer, because you must depend upon your own\r\n      ingenuity to make it fit into your article. Now write!\r\n\r\n      “‘_Aussi tendre que Zaire_’—as tender as Zaire-French. Alludes to\r\n      the frequent repetition of the phrase, _la tendre Zaire_, in the\r\n      French tragedy of that name. Properly introduced, will show not\r\n      only your knowledge of the language, but your general reading and\r\n      wit. You can say, for instance, that the chicken you were eating\r\n      (write an article about being choked to death by a chicken-bone)\r\n      was not altogether _aussi tendre que Zaire_. Write!\r\n\r\n‘Van muerte tan escondida,\r\n    Que no te sienta venir,\r\nPorque el plazer del morir,\r\n    No mestorne a dar la vida.’\r\n\r\n      “That’s Spanish—from Miguel de Cervantes. ‘Come quickly, O death!\r\n      but be sure and don’t let me see you coming, lest the pleasure I\r\n      shall feel at your appearance should unfortunately bring me back\r\n      again to life.’ This you may slip in quite a propos when you are\r\n      struggling in the last agonies with the chicken-bone. Write!\r\n\r\n      ‘Il pover ‘huomo che non se’n era accorto,\r\n      Andava combattendo, e era morto.‘\r\n\r\n      “That’s Italian, you perceive—from Ariosto. It means that a great\r\n      hero, in the heat of combat, not perceiving that he had been\r\n      fairly killed, continued to fight valiantly, dead as he was. The\r\n      application of this to your own case is obvious—for I trust, Miss\r\n      Psyche, that you will not neglect to kick for at least an hour\r\n      and a half after you have been choked to death by that\r\n      chicken-bone. Please to write!\r\n\r\n      ‘Und sterb’ich doch, no sterb’ich denn\r\n      Durch sie—durch sie!’’\r\n\r\n      “That’s German—from Schiller. ‘And if I die, at least I die—for\r\n      thee—for thee!’ Here it is clear that you are apostrophizing the\r\n      cause of your disaster, the chicken. Indeed what gentleman (or\r\n      lady either) of sense, wouldn’t die, I should like to know, for a\r\n      well fattened capon of the right Molucca breed, stuffed with\r\n      capers and mushrooms, and served up in a salad-bowl, with\r\n      orange-jellies _en mosaïques_. Write! (You can get them that way\r\n      at Tortoni’s)—Write, if you please!\r\n\r\n      “Here is a nice little Latin phrase, and rare too, (one can’t be\r\n      too _recherché_ or brief in one’s Latin, it’s getting so\r\n      common—ignoratio elenchi. He has committed an ignoratio\r\n      elenchi—that is to say, he has understood the words of your\r\n      proposition, but not the idea. The man was a fool, you see. Some\r\n      poor fellow whom you address while choking with that\r\n      chicken-bone, and who therefore didn’t precisely understand what\r\n      you were talking about. Throw the ignoratio elenchi in his teeth,\r\n      and, at once, you have him annihilated. If he dares to reply, you\r\n      can tell him from Lucan (here it is) that speeches are mere\r\n      anemonae verborum, anemone words. The anemone, with great\r\n      brilliancy, has no smell. Or, if he begins to bluster, you may be\r\n      down upon him with insomnia Jovis, reveries of Jupiter—a phrase\r\n      which Silius Italicus (see here!) applies to thoughts pompous and\r\n      inflated. This will be sure and cut him to the heart. He can do\r\n      nothing but roll over and die. Will you be kind enough to write?\r\n\r\n      “In Greek we must have some thing pretty—from Demosthenes, for\r\n      example. Ανερο φευων και παλιν μαχεσεται. [Aner o pheugoen kai\r\n      palin makesetai.] There is a tolerably good translation of it in\r\n      Hudibras—\r\n\r\n        ‘For he that flies may fight again,\r\n     Which he can never do that’s slain.’\r\n\r\n      In a Blackwood article nothing makes so fine a show as your\r\n      Greek. The very letters have an air of profundity about them.\r\n      Only observe, madam, the astute look of that Epsilon! That Phi\r\n      ought certainly to be a bishop! Was ever there a smarter fellow\r\n      than that Omicron? Just twig that Tau! In short, there is nothing\r\n      like Greek for a genuine sensation-paper. In the present case\r\n      your application is the most obvious thing in the world. Rap out\r\n      the sentence, with a huge oath, and by way of ultimatum at the\r\n      good-for-nothing dunder-headed villain who couldn’t understand\r\n      your plain English in relation to the chicken-bone. He’ll take\r\n      the hint and be off, you may depend upon it.”\r\n\r\n      These were all the instructions Mr. B. could afford me upon the\r\n      topic in question, but I felt they would be entirely sufficient.\r\n      I was, at length, able to write a genuine Blackwood article, and\r\n      determined to do it forthwith. In taking leave of me, Mr. B. made\r\n      a proposition for the purchase of the paper when written; but as\r\n      he could offer me only fifty guineas a sheet, I thought it better\r\n      to let our society have it, than sacrifice it for so paltry a\r\n      sum. Notwithstanding this niggardly spirit, however, the\r\n      gentleman showed his consideration for me in all other respects,\r\n      and indeed treated me with the greatest civility. His parting\r\n      words made a deep impression upon my heart, and I hope I shall\r\n      always remember them with gratitude.\r\n\r\n      “My dear Miss Zenobia,” he said, while the tears stood in his\r\n      eyes, “is there anything else I can do to promote the success of\r\n      your laudable undertaking? Let me reflect! It is just possible\r\n      that you may not be able, so soon as convenient, to—to—get\r\n      yourself drowned, or—choked with a chicken-bone, or—or\r\n      hung,—or—bitten by a—but stay! Now I think me of it, there are a\r\n      couple of very excellent bull-dogs in the yard—fine fellows, I\r\n      assure you—savage, and all that—indeed just the thing for your\r\n      money—they’ll have you eaten up, auricula and all, in less than\r\n      five minutes (here’s my watch!)—and then only think of the\r\n      sensations! Here! I say—Tom!—Peter!—Dick, you villain!—let out\r\n      those”—but as I was really in a great hurry, and had not another\r\n      moment to spare, I was reluctantly forced to expedite my\r\n      departure, and accordingly took leave at once—somewhat more\r\n      abruptly, I admit, than strict courtesy would have otherwise\r\n      allowed.\r\n\r\n      It was my primary object upon quitting Mr. Blackwood, to get into\r\n      some immediate difficulty, pursuant to his advice, and with this\r\n      view I spent the greater part of the day in wandering about\r\n      Edinburgh, seeking for desperate adventures—adventures adequate\r\n      to the intensity of my feelings, and adapted to the vast\r\n      character of the article I intended to write. In this excursion I\r\n      was attended by one negro servant, Pompey, and my little lap-dog\r\n      Diana, whom I had brought with me from Philadelphia. It was not,\r\n      however, until late in the afternoon that I fully succeeded in my\r\n      arduous undertaking. An important event then happened of which\r\n      the following Blackwood article, in the tone heterogeneous, is\r\n      the substance and result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PREDICAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat chance, good lady, hath bereft you thus?—COMUS.\r\n\r\n      It was a quiet and still afternoon when I strolled forth in the\r\n      goodly city of Edina. The confusion and bustle in the streets\r\n      were terrible. Men were talking. Women were screaming. Children\r\n      were choking. Pigs were whistling. Carts they rattled. Bulls they\r\n      bellowed. Cows they lowed. Horses they neighed. Cats they\r\n      caterwauled. Dogs they danced. _Danced!_ Could it then be\r\n      possible? Danced! Alas, thought I, my dancing days are over! Thus\r\n      it is ever. What a host of gloomy recollections will ever and\r\n      anon be awakened in the mind of genius and imaginative\r\n      contemplation, especially of a genius doomed to the everlasting,\r\n      and eternal, and continual, and, as one might say,\r\n      the—continued—yes, the continued and continuous, bitter,\r\n      harassing, disturbing, and, if I may be allowed the expression,\r\n      the very disturbing influence of the serene, and godlike, and\r\n      heavenly, and exalted, and elevated, and purifying effect of what\r\n      may be rightly termed the most enviable, the most truly\r\n      enviable—nay! the most benignly beautiful, the most deliciously\r\n      ethereal, and, as it were, the most pretty (if I may use so bold\r\n      an expression) thing (pardon me, gentle reader!) in the world—but\r\n      I am always led away by my feelings. In such a mind, I repeat,\r\n      what a host of recollections are stirred up by a trifle! The dogs\r\n      danced! I—I could not! They frisked—I wept. They capered—I sobbed\r\n      aloud. Touching circumstances! which cannot fail to bring to the\r\n      recollection of the classical reader that exquisite passage in\r\n      relation to the fitness of things, which is to be found in the\r\n      commencement of the third volume of that admirable and venerable\r\n      Chinese novel the Jo-Go-Slow.\r\n\r\n      In my solitary walk through, the city I had two humble but\r\n      faithful companions. Diana, my poodle! sweetest of creatures! She\r\n      had a quantity of hair over her one eye, and a blue ribbon tied\r\n      fashionably around her neck. Diana was not more than five inches\r\n      in height, but her head was somewhat bigger than her body, and\r\n      her tail being cut off exceedingly close, gave an air of injured\r\n      innocence to the interesting animal which rendered her a favorite\r\n      with all.\r\n\r\n      And Pompey, my negro!—sweet Pompey! how shall I ever forget thee?\r\n      I had taken Pompey’s arm. He was three feet in height (I like to\r\n      be particular) and about seventy, or perhaps eighty, years of\r\n      age. He had bow-legs and was corpulent. His mouth should not be\r\n      called small, nor his ears short. His teeth, however, were like\r\n      pearl, and his large full eyes were deliciously white. Nature had\r\n      endowed him with no neck, and had placed his ankles (as usual\r\n      with that race) in the middle of the upper portion of the feet.\r\n      He was clad with a striking simplicity. His sole garments were a\r\n      stock of nine inches in height, and a nearly-new drab overcoat\r\n      which had formerly been in the service of the tall, stately, and\r\n      illustrious Dr. Moneypenny. It was a good overcoat. It was well\r\n      cut. It was well made. The coat was nearly new. Pompey held it up\r\n      out of the dirt with both hands.\r\n\r\n      There were three persons in our party, and two of them have\r\n      already been the subject of remark. There was a third—that person\r\n      was myself. I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia. I am not Suky\r\n      Snobbs. My appearance is commanding. On the memorable occasion of\r\n      which I speak I was habited in a crimson satin dress, with a\r\n      sky-blue Arabian mantelet. And the dress had trimmings of green\r\n      agraffas, and seven graceful flounces of the orange-colored\r\n      auricula. I thus formed the third of the party. There was the\r\n      poodle. There was Pompey. There was myself. We were three. Thus\r\n      it is said there were originally but three Furies—Melty, Nimmy,\r\n      and Hetty—Meditation, Memory, and Fiddling.\r\n\r\n      Leaning upon the arm of the gallant Pompey, and attended at a\r\n      respectable distance by Diana, I proceeded down one of the\r\n      populous and very pleasant streets of the now deserted Edina. On\r\n      a sudden, there presented itself to view a church—a Gothic\r\n      cathedral—vast, venerable, and with a tall steeple, which towered\r\n      into the sky. What madness now possessed me? Why did I rush upon\r\n      my fate? I was seized with an uncontrollable desire to ascend the\r\n      giddy pinnacle, and then survey the immense extent of the city.\r\n      The door of the cathedral stood invitingly open. My destiny\r\n      prevailed. I entered the ominous archway. Where then was my\r\n      guardian angel?—if indeed such angels there be. If! Distressing\r\n      monosyllable! what world of mystery, and meaning, and doubt, and\r\n      uncertainty is there involved in thy two letters! I entered the\r\n      ominous archway! I entered; and, without injury to my\r\n      orange-colored auriculas, I passed beneath the portal, and\r\n      emerged within the vestibule. Thus it is said the immense river\r\n      Alfred passed, unscathed, and unwetted, beneath the sea.\r\n\r\n      I thought the staircase would never have an end. Round! Yes, they\r\n      went round and up, and round and up and round and up, until I\r\n      could not help surmising, with the sagacious Pompey, upon whose\r\n      supporting arm I leaned in all the confidence of early\r\n      affection—I could not help surmising that the upper end of the\r\n      continuous spiral ladder had been accidentally, or perhaps\r\n      designedly, removed. I paused for breath; and, in the meantime,\r\n      an accident occurred of too momentous a nature in a moral, and\r\n      also in a metaphysical point of view, to be passed over without\r\n      notice. It appeared to me—indeed I was quite confident of the\r\n      fact—I could not be mistaken—no! I had, for some moments,\r\n      carefully and anxiously observed the motions of my Diana—I say\r\n      that I could not be mistaken—Diana smelt a rat! At once I called\r\n      Pompey’s attention to the subject, and he—he agreed with me.\r\n      There was then no longer any reasonable room for doubt. The rat\r\n      had been smelled—and by Diana. Heavens! shall I ever forget the\r\n      intense excitement of the moment? Alas! what is the boasted\r\n      intellect of man? The rat!—it was there—that is to say, it was\r\n      somewhere. Diana smelled the rat. I—I could not! Thus it is said\r\n      the Prussian Isis has, for some persons, a sweet and very\r\n      powerful perfume, while to others it is perfectly scentless.\r\n\r\n      The staircase had been surmounted, and there were now only three\r\n      or four more upward steps intervening between us and the summit.\r\n      We still ascended, and now only one step remained. One step! One\r\n      little, little step! Upon one such little step in the great\r\n      staircase of human life how vast a sum of human happiness or\r\n      misery depends! I thought of myself, then of Pompey, and then of\r\n      the mysterious and inexplicable destiny which surrounded us. I\r\n      thought of Pompey!—alas, I thought of love! I thought of my many\r\n      false steps which have been taken, and may be taken again. I\r\n      resolved to be more cautious, more reserved. I abandoned the arm\r\n      of Pompey, and, without his assistance, surmounted the one\r\n      remaining step, and gained the chamber of the belfry. I was\r\n      followed immediately afterward by my poodle. Pompey alone\r\n      remained behind. I stood at the head of the staircase, and\r\n      encouraged him to ascend. He stretched forth to me his hand, and\r\n      unfortunately in so doing was forced to abandon his firm hold\r\n      upon the overcoat. Will the gods never cease their persecution?\r\n      The overcoat is dropped, and, with one of his feet, Pompey\r\n      stepped upon the long and trailing skirt of the overcoat. He\r\n      stumbled and fell—this consequence was inevitable. He fell\r\n      forward, and, with his accursed head, striking me full in the—in\r\n      the breast, precipitated me headlong, together with himself, upon\r\n      the hard, filthy, and detestable floor of the belfry. But my\r\n      revenge was sure, sudden, and complete. Seizing him furiously by\r\n      the wool with both hands, I tore out a vast quantity of black,\r\n      and crisp, and curling material, and tossed it from me with every\r\n      manifestation of disdain. It fell among the ropes of the belfry\r\n      and remained. Pompey arose, and said no word. But he regarded me\r\n      piteously with his large eyes and—sighed. Ye Gods—that sigh! It\r\n      sunk into my heart. And the hair—the wool! Could I have reached\r\n      that wool I would have bathed it with my tears, in testimony of\r\n      regret. But alas! it was now far beyond my grasp. As it dangled\r\n      among the cordage of the bell, I fancied it alive. I fancied that\r\n      it stood on end with indignation. Thus the happy-dandy Flos Aeris\r\n      of Java bears, it is said, a beautiful flower, which will live\r\n      when pulled up by the roots. The natives suspend it by a cord\r\n      from the ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years.\r\n\r\n      Our quarrel was now made up, and we looked about the room for an\r\n      aperture through which to survey the city of Edina. Windows there\r\n      were none. The sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber\r\n      proceeded from a square opening, about a foot in diameter, at a\r\n      height of about seven feet from the floor. Yet what will the\r\n      energy of true genius not effect? I resolved to clamber up to\r\n      this hole. A vast quantity of wheels, pinions, and other\r\n      cabalistic-looking machinery stood opposite the hole, close to\r\n      it; and through the hole there passed an iron rod from the\r\n      machinery. Between the wheels and the wall where the hole lay\r\n      there was barely room for my body—yet I was desperate, and\r\n      determined to persevere. I called Pompey to my side.\r\n\r\n      “You perceive that aperture, Pompey. I wish to look through it.\r\n      You will stand here just beneath the hole—so. Now, hold out one\r\n      of your hands, Pompey, and let me step upon it—thus. Now, the\r\n      other hand, Pompey, and with its aid I will get upon your\r\n      shoulders.”\r\n\r\n      He did every thing I wished, and I found, upon getting up, that I\r\n      could easily pass my head and neck through the aperture. The\r\n      prospect was sublime. Nothing could be more magnificent. I merely\r\n      paused a moment to bid Diana behave herself, and assure Pompey\r\n      that I would be considerate and bear as lightly as possible upon\r\n      his shoulders. I told him I would be tender of his feelings—ossi\r\n      tender que beefsteak. Having done this justice to my faithful\r\n      friend, I gave myself up with great zest and enthusiasm to the\r\n      enjoyment of the scene which so obligingly spread itself out\r\n      before my eyes.\r\n\r\n      Upon this subject, however, I shall forbear to dilate. I will not\r\n      describe the city of Edinburgh. Every one has been to the city of\r\n      Edinburgh. Every one has been to Edinburgh—the classic Edina. I\r\n      will confine myself to the momentous details of my own lamentable\r\n      adventure. Having, in some measure, satisfied my curiosity in\r\n      regard to the extent, situation, and general appearance of the\r\n      city, I had leisure to survey the church in which I was, and the\r\n      delicate architecture of the steeple. I observed that the\r\n      aperture through which I had thrust my head was an opening in the\r\n      dial-plate of a gigantic clock, and must have appeared, from the\r\n      street, as a large key-hole, such as we see in the face of the\r\n      French watches. No doubt the true object was to admit the arm of\r\n      an attendant, to adjust, when necessary, the hands of the clock\r\n      from within. I observed also, with surprise, the immense size of\r\n      these hands, the longest of which could not have been less than\r\n      ten feet in length, and, where broadest, eight or nine inches in\r\n      breadth. They were of solid steel apparently, and their edges\r\n      appeared to be sharp. Having noticed these particulars, and some\r\n      others, I again turned my eyes upon the glorious prospect below,\r\n      and soon became absorbed in contemplation.\r\n\r\n      From this, after some minutes, I was aroused by the voice of\r\n      Pompey, who declared that he could stand it no longer, and\r\n      requested that I would be so kind as to come down. This was\r\n      unreasonable, and I told him so in a speech of some length. He\r\n      replied, but with an evident misunderstanding of my ideas upon\r\n      the subject. I accordingly grew angry, and told him in plain\r\n      words, that he was a fool, that he had committed an ignoramus\r\n      e-clench-eye, that his notions were mere insommary Bovis, and his\r\n      words little better than an ennemywerrybor’em. With this he\r\n      appeared satisfied, and I resumed my contemplations.\r\n\r\n      It might have been half an hour after this altercation when, as I\r\n      was deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery beneath me, I was\r\n      startled by something very cold which pressed with a gentle\r\n      pressure on the back of my neck. It is needless to say that I\r\n      felt inexpressibly alarmed. I knew that Pompey was beneath my\r\n      feet, and that Diana was sitting, according to my explicit\r\n      directions, upon her hind legs, in the farthest corner of the\r\n      room. What could it be? Alas! I but too soon discovered. Turning\r\n      my head gently to one side, I perceived, to my extreme horror,\r\n      that the huge, glittering, scimetar-like minute-hand of the clock\r\n      had, in the course of its hourly revolution, descended upon my\r\n      neck. There was, I knew, not a second to be lost. I pulled back\r\n      at once—but it was too late. There was no chance of forcing my\r\n      head through the mouth of that terrible trap in which it was so\r\n      fairly caught, and which grew narrower and narrower with a\r\n      rapidity too horrible to be conceived. The agony of that moment\r\n      is not to be imagined. I threw up my hands and endeavored, with\r\n      all my strength, to force upward the ponderous iron bar. I might\r\n      as well have tried to lift the cathedral itself. Down, down, down\r\n      it came, closer and yet closer. I screamed to Pompey for aid; but\r\n      he said that I had hurt his feelings by calling him “an ignorant\r\n      old squint-eye.” I yelled to Diana; but she only said\r\n      “bow-wow-wow,” and that I had told her “on no account to stir\r\n      from the corner.” Thus I had no relief to expect from my\r\n      associates.\r\n\r\n      Meantime the ponderous and terrific Scythe of Time (for I now\r\n      discovered the literal import of that classical phrase) had not\r\n      stopped, nor was it likely to stop, in its career. Down and still\r\n      down, it came. It had already buried its sharp edge a full inch\r\n      in my flesh, and my sensations grew indistinct and confused. At\r\n      one time I fancied myself in Philadelphia with the stately Dr.\r\n      Moneypenny, at another in the back parlor of Mr. Blackwood\r\n      receiving his invaluable instructions. And then again the sweet\r\n      recollection of better and earlier times came over me, and I\r\n      thought of that happy period when the world was not all a desert,\r\n      and Pompey not altogether cruel.\r\n\r\n      The ticking of the machinery amused me. Amused me, I say, for my\r\n      sensations now bordered upon perfect happiness, and the most\r\n      trifling circumstances afforded me pleasure. The eternal\r\n      click-clak, click-clak, click-clak of the clock was the most\r\n      melodious of music in my ears, and occasionally even put me in\r\n      mind of the graceful sermonic harangues of Dr. Ollapod. Then\r\n      there were the great figures upon the dial-plate—how intelligent\r\n      how intellectual, they all looked! And presently they took to\r\n      dancing the Mazurka, and I think it was the figure V. who\r\n      performed the most to my satisfaction. She was evidently a lady\r\n      of breeding. None of your swaggerers, and nothing at all\r\n      indelicate in her motions. She did the pirouette to\r\n      admiration—whirling round upon her apex. I made an endeavor to\r\n      hand her a chair, for I saw that she appeared fatigued with her\r\n      exertions—and it was not until then that I fully perceived my\r\n      lamentable situation. Lamentable indeed! The bar had buried\r\n      itself two inches in my neck. I was aroused to a sense of\r\n      exquisite pain. I prayed for death, and, in the agony of the\r\n      moment, could not help repeating those exquisite verses of the\r\n      poet Miguel De Cervantes:\r\n\r\n     Vanny Buren, tan escondida\r\n     Query no te senty venny\r\n     Pork and pleasure, delly morry\r\n     Nommy, torny, darry, widdy!\r\n\r\n      But now a new horror presented itself, and one indeed sufficient\r\n      to startle the strongest nerves. My eyes, from the cruel pressure\r\n      of the machine, were absolutely starting from their sockets.\r\n      While I was thinking how I should possibly manage without them,\r\n      one actually tumbled out of my head, and, rolling down the steep\r\n      side of the steeple, lodged in the rain gutter which ran along\r\n      the eaves of the main building. The loss of the eye was not so\r\n      much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which\r\n      it regarded me after it was out. There it lay in the gutter just\r\n      under my nose, and the airs it gave itself would have been\r\n      ridiculous had they not been disgusting. Such a winking and\r\n      blinking were never before seen. This behavior on the part of my\r\n      eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its\r\n      manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude, but was also\r\n      exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which always\r\n      exists between two eyes of the same head, however far apart. I\r\n      was forced, in a manner, to wink and to blink, whether I would or\r\n      not, in exact concert with the scoundrelly thing that lay just\r\n      under my nose. I was presently relieved, however, by the dropping\r\n      out of the other eye. In falling it took the same direction\r\n      (possibly a concerted plot) as its fellow. Both rolled out of the\r\n      gutter together, and in truth I was very glad to get rid of them.\r\n\r\n      The bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck, and there\r\n      was only a little bit of skin to cut through. My sensations were\r\n      those of entire happiness, for I felt that in a few minutes, at\r\n      farthest, I should be relieved from my disagreeable situation.\r\n      And in this expectation I was not at all deceived. At twenty-five\r\n      minutes past five in the afternoon, precisely, the huge\r\n      minute-hand had proceeded sufficiently far on its terrible\r\n      revolution to sever the small remainder of my neck. I was not\r\n      sorry to see the head which had occasioned me so much\r\n      embarrassment at length make a final separation from my body. It\r\n      first rolled down the side of the steeple, then lodge, for a few\r\n      seconds, in the gutter, and then made its way, with a plunge,\r\n      into the middle of the street.\r\n\r\n      I will candidly confess that my feelings were now of the most\r\n      singular—nay, of the most mysterious, the most perplexing and\r\n      incomprehensible character. My senses were here and there at one\r\n      and the same moment. With my head I imagined, at one time, that\r\n      I, the head, was the real Signora Psyche Zenobia—at another I\r\n      felt convinced that myself, the body, was the proper identity. To\r\n      clear my ideas on this topic I felt in my pocket for my\r\n      snuff-box, but, upon getting it, and endeavoring to apply a pinch\r\n      of its grateful contents in the ordinary manner, I became\r\n      immediately aware of my peculiar deficiency, and threw the box at\r\n      once down to my head. It took a pinch with great satisfaction,\r\n      and smiled me an acknowledgement in return. Shortly afterward it\r\n      made me a speech, which I could hear but indistinctly without\r\n      ears. I gathered enough, however, to know that it was astonished\r\n      at my wishing to remain alive under such circumstances. In the\r\n      concluding sentences it quoted the noble words of Ariosto—\r\n\r\n     Il pover hommy che non sera corty\r\n      And have a combat tenty erry morty;\r\n\r\n      thus comparing me to the hero who, in the heat of the combat, not\r\n      perceiving that he was dead, continued to contest the battle with\r\n      inextinguishable valor. There was nothing now to prevent my\r\n      getting down from my elevation, and I did so. What it was that\r\n      Pompey saw so very peculiar in my appearance I have never yet\r\n      been able to find out. The fellow opened his mouth from ear to\r\n      ear, and shut his two eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack\r\n      nuts between the lids. Finally, throwing off his overcoat, he\r\n      made one spring for the staircase and disappeared. I hurled after\r\n      the scoundrel these vehement words of Demosthenes—\r\n\r\n      Andrew O’Phlegethon, you really make haste to fly,\r\n\r\n      and then turned to the darling of my heart, to the one-eyed! the\r\n      shaggy-haired Diana. Alas! what a horrible vision affronted my\r\n      eyes? Was that a rat I saw skulking into his hole? Are these the\r\n      picked bones of the little angel who has been cruelly devoured by\r\n      the monster? Ye gods! and what do I behold—is that the departed\r\n      spirit, the shade, the ghost, of my beloved puppy, which I\r\n      perceive sitting with a grace so melancholy, in the corner?\r\n      Hearken! for she speaks, and, heavens! it is in the German of\r\n      Schiller—\r\n\r\n      “Unt stubby duk, so stubby dun\r\n       Duk she! duk she!”\r\n\r\n      Alas! and are not her words too true?\r\n\r\n      “And if I died, at least I died\r\n       For thee—for thee.”\r\n\r\n      Sweet creature! she too has sacrificed herself in my behalf.\r\n      Dogless, niggerless, headless, what now remains for the unhappy\r\n      Signora Psyche Zenobia? Alas—nothing! I have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMYSTIFICATION\r\n\r\n\r\n     Slid, if these be your “passados” and “montantes,” I’ll have none\r\n     o’ them.\r\n                    —NED KNOWLES.\r\n\r\n      The Baron Ritzner von Jung was a noble Hungarian family, every\r\n      member of which (at least as far back into antiquity as any\r\n      certain records extend) was more or less remarkable for talent of\r\n      some description—the majority for that species of _grotesquerie_\r\n      in conception of which Tieck, a scion of the house, has given a\r\n      vivid, although by no means the most vivid exemplifications. My\r\n      acquaintance with Ritzner commenced at the magnificent Chateau\r\n      Jung, into which a train of droll adventures, not to be made\r\n      public, threw me during the summer months of the year 18—. Here\r\n      it was that I obtained a place in his regard, and here, with\r\n      somewhat more difficulty, a partial insight into his mental\r\n      conformation. In later days this insight grew more clear, as the\r\n      intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close; and\r\n      when, after three years separation, we met at G——n, I knew all\r\n      that it was necessary to know of the character of the Baron\r\n      Ritzner von Jung.\r\n\r\n      I remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within\r\n      the college precincts on the night of the twenty-fifth of June. I\r\n      remember still more distinctly, that while he was pronounced by\r\n      all parties at first sight “the most remarkable man in the\r\n      world,” no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion.\r\n      That he was unique appeared so undeniable, that it was deemed\r\n      impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted. But,\r\n      letting this matter pass for the present, I will merely observe\r\n      that, from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits\r\n      of the university, he began to exercise over the habits, manners,\r\n      persons, purses, and propensities of the whole community which\r\n      surrounded him, an influence the most extensive and despotic, yet\r\n      at the same time the most indefinite and altogether\r\n      unaccountable. Thus the brief period of his residence at the\r\n      university forms an era in its annals, and is characterized by\r\n      all classes of people appertaining to it or its dependencies as\r\n      “that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the\r\n      Baron Ritzner von Jung.”\r\n\r\n      Upon his advent to G——n, he sought me out in my apartments. He\r\n      was then of no particular age, by which I mean that it was\r\n      impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data\r\n      personally afforded. He might have been fifteen or fifty, and was\r\n      twenty-one years and seven months. He was by no means a handsome\r\n      man—perhaps the reverse. The contour of his face was somewhat\r\n      angular and harsh. His forehead was lofty and very fair; his nose\r\n      a snub; his eyes large, heavy, glassy, and meaningless. About the\r\n      mouth there was more to be observed. The lips were gently\r\n      protruded, and rested the one upon the other, after such a\r\n      fashion that it is impossible to conceive any, even the most\r\n      complex, combination of human features, conveying so entirely,\r\n      and so singly, the idea of unmitigated gravity, solemnity and\r\n      repose.\r\n\r\n      It will be perceived, no doubt, from what I have already said,\r\n      that the Baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to\r\n      be found, who make the science of mystification the study and the\r\n      business of their lives. For this science a peculiar turn of mind\r\n      gave him instinctively the cue, while his physical appearance\r\n      afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into\r\n      effect. I firmly believe that no student at G——n, during that\r\n      renowned epoch so quaintly termed the domination of the Baron\r\n      Ritzner von Jung, ever rightly entered into the mystery which\r\n      overshadowed his character. I truly think that no person at the\r\n      university, with the exception of myself, ever suspected him to\r\n      be capable of a joke, verbal or practical:—the old bull-dog at\r\n      the garden-gate would sooner have been accused,—the ghost of\r\n      Heraclitus,—or the wig of the Emeritus Professor of Theology.\r\n      This, too, when it was evident that the most egregious and\r\n      unpardonable of all conceivable tricks, whimsicalities and\r\n      buffooneries were brought about, if not directly by him, at least\r\n      plainly through his intermediate agency or connivance. The\r\n      beauty, if I may so call it, of his art mystifique, lay in that\r\n      consummate ability (resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge\r\n      of human nature, and a most wonderful self-possession,) by means\r\n      of which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries he\r\n      was occupied in bringing to a point, arose partly in spite, and\r\n      partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for\r\n      their prevention, and for the preservation of the good order and\r\n      dignity of Alma Mater. The deep, the poignant, the overwhelming\r\n      mortification, which upon each such failure of his praise worthy\r\n      endeavors, would suffuse every lineament of his countenance, left\r\n      not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms\r\n      of even his most skeptical companions. The adroitness, too, was\r\n      no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the\r\n      sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created—from his\r\n      own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise. In no\r\n      instance before that of which I speak, have I known the habitual\r\n      mystific escape the natural consequence of his manoevres—an\r\n      attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person.\r\n      Continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim, my friend\r\n      appeared to live only for the severities of society; and not even\r\n      his own household have for a moment associated other ideas than\r\n      those of the rigid and august with the memory of the Baron\r\n      Ritzner von Jung.\r\n\r\n      During the epoch of his residence at G——n it really appeared that\r\n      the demon of the _dolce far niente_ lay like an incubus upon the\r\n      university. Nothing, at least, was done beyond eating and\r\n      drinking and making merry. The apartments of the students were\r\n      converted into so many pot-houses, and there was no pot-house of\r\n      them all more famous or more frequented than that of the Baron.\r\n      Our carousals here were many, and boisterous, and long, and never\r\n      unfruitful of events.\r\n\r\n      Upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly\r\n      daybreak, and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk. The\r\n      company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the Baron\r\n      and myself. Most of these were young men of wealth, of high\r\n      connection, of great family pride, and all alive with an\r\n      exaggerated sense of honor. They abounded in the most ultra\r\n      German opinions respecting the duello. To these Quixotic notions\r\n      some recent Parisian publications, backed by three or four\r\n      desperate and fatal rencounters at G——n, had given new vigor and\r\n      impulse; and thus the conversation, during the greater part of\r\n      the night, had run wild upon the all-engrossing topic of the\r\n      times. The Baron, who had been unusually silent and abstracted in\r\n      the earlier portion of the evening, at length seemed to be\r\n      aroused from his apathy, took a leading part in the discourse,\r\n      and dwelt upon the benefits, and more especially upon the\r\n      beauties, of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms\r\n      with an ardor, an eloquence, an impressiveness, and an\r\n      affectionateness of manner, which elicited the warmest enthusiasm\r\n      from his hearers in general, and absolutely staggered even\r\n      myself, who well knew him to be at heart a ridiculer of those\r\n      very points for which he contended, and especially to hold the\r\n      entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign\r\n      contempt which it deserves.\r\n\r\n      Looking around me during a pause in the Baron’s discourse (of\r\n      which my readers may gather some faint idea when I say that it\r\n      bore resemblance to the fervid, chanting, monotonous, yet musical\r\n      sermonic manner of Coleridge), I perceived symptoms of even more\r\n      than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party.\r\n      This gentleman, whom I shall call Hermann, was an original in\r\n      every respect—except, perhaps, in the single particular that he\r\n      was a very great fool. He contrived to bear, however, among a\r\n      particular set at the university, a reputation for deep\r\n      metaphysical thinking, and, I believe, for some logical talent.\r\n      As a duellist he had acquired great renown, even at G——n. I\r\n      forget the precise number of victims who had fallen at his hands;\r\n      but they were many. He was a man of courage undoubtedly. But it\r\n      was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the\r\n      duello, and the nicety of his sense of honor, that he most\r\n      especially prided himself. These things were a hobby which he\r\n      rode to the death. To Ritzner, ever upon the lookout for the\r\n      grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded\r\n      food for mystification. Of this, however, I was not aware;\r\n      although, in the present instance, I saw clearly that something\r\n      of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend, and that\r\n      Hermann was its especial object.\r\n\r\n      As the former proceeded in his discourse, or rather monologue, I\r\n      perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing. At\r\n      length he spoke; offering some objection to a point insisted upon\r\n      by R., and giving his reasons in detail. To these the Baron\r\n      replied at length (still maintaining his exaggerated tone of\r\n      sentiment) and concluding, in what I thought very bad taste, with\r\n      a sarcasm and a sneer. The hobby of Hermann now took the bit in\r\n      his teeth. This I could discern by the studied hair-splitting\r\n      farrago of his rejoinder. His last words I distinctly remember.\r\n      “Your opinions, allow me to say, Baron von Jung, although in the\r\n      main correct, are, in many nice points, discreditable to yourself\r\n      and to the university of which you are a member. In a few\r\n      respects they are even unworthy of serious refutation. I would\r\n      say more than this, sir, were it not for the fear of giving you\r\n      offence (here the speaker smiled blandly), I would say, sir, that\r\n      your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a\r\n      gentleman.”\r\n\r\n      As Hermann completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were\r\n      turned upon the Baron. He became pale, then excessively red;\r\n      then, dropping his pocket-handkerchief, stooped to recover it,\r\n      when I caught a glimpse of his countenance, while it could be\r\n      seen by no one else at the table. It was radiant with the\r\n      quizzical expression which was its natural character, but which I\r\n      had never seen it assume except when we were alone together, and\r\n      when he unbent himself freely. In an instant afterward he stood\r\n      erect, confronting Hermann; and so total an alteration of\r\n      countenance in so short a period I certainly never saw before.\r\n      For a moment I even fancied that I had misconceived him, and that\r\n      he was in sober earnest. He appeared to be stifling with passion,\r\n      and his face was cadaverously white. For a short time he remained\r\n      silent, apparently striving to master his emotion. Having at\r\n      length seemingly succeeded, he reached a decanter which stood\r\n      near him, saying as he held it firmly clenched—“The language you\r\n      have thought proper to employ, Mynheer Hermann, in addressing\r\n      yourself to me, is objectionable in so many particulars, that I\r\n      have neither temper nor time for specification. That my opinions,\r\n      however, are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman, is\r\n      an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line\r\n      of conduct. Some courtesy, nevertheless, is due to the presence\r\n      of this company, and to yourself, at this moment, as my guest.\r\n      You will pardon me, therefore, if, upon this consideration, I\r\n      deviate slightly from the general usage among gentlemen in\r\n      similar cases of personal affront. You will forgive me for the\r\n      moderate tax I shall make upon your imagination, and endeavor to\r\n      consider, for an instant, the reflection of your person in yonder\r\n      mirror as the living Mynheer Hermann himself. This being done,\r\n      there will be no difficulty whatever. I shall discharge this\r\n      decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror, and thus fulfil\r\n      all the spirit, if not the exact letter, of resentment for your\r\n      insult, while the necessity of physical violence to your real\r\n      person will be obviated.”\r\n\r\n      With these words he hurled the decanter, full of wine, against\r\n      the mirror which hung directly opposite Hermann; striking the\r\n      reflection of his person with great precision, and of course\r\n      shattering the glass into fragments. The whole company at once\r\n      started to their feet, and, with the exception of myself and\r\n      Ritzner, took their departure. As Hermann went out, the Baron\r\n      whispered me that I should follow him and make an offer of my\r\n      services. To this I agreed; not knowing precisely what to make of\r\n      so ridiculous a piece of business.\r\n\r\n      The duellist accepted my aid with his stiff and _ultra recherché_\r\n      air, and, taking my arm, led me to his apartment. I could hardly\r\n      forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss, with\r\n      the profoundest gravity, what he termed “the refinedly peculiar\r\n      character” of the insult he had received. After a tiresome\r\n      harangue in his ordinary style, he took down from his book\r\n      shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello,\r\n      and entertained me for a long time with their contents; reading\r\n      aloud, and commenting earnestly as he read. I can just remember\r\n      the titles of some of the works. There were the “Ordonnance of\r\n      Philip le Bel on Single Combat”; the “Theatre of Honor,” by\r\n      Favyn, and a treatise “On the Permission of Duels,” by Andiguier.\r\n      He displayed, also, with much pomposity, Brantome’s “Memoirs of\r\n      Duels,” published at Cologne, 1666, in the types of Elzevir—a\r\n      precious and unique vellum-paper volume, with a fine margin, and\r\n      bound by Derome. But he requested my attention particularly, and\r\n      with an air of mysterious sagacity, to a thick octavo, written in\r\n      barbarous Latin by one Hedelin, a Frenchman, and having the\r\n      quaint title, “Duelli Lex Scripta, et non; aliterque.” From this\r\n      he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world concerning\r\n      “Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se,”\r\n      about half of which, he averred, was strictly applicable to his\r\n      own “refinedly peculiar” case, although not one syllable of the\r\n      whole matter could I understand for the life of me. Having\r\n      finished the chapter, he closed the book, and demanded what I\r\n      thought necessary to be done. I replied that I had entire\r\n      confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling, and would abide\r\n      by what he proposed. With this answer he seemed flattered, and\r\n      sat down to write a note to the Baron. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n      Sir,—My friend, M. P.-, will hand you this note. I find it\r\n      incumbent upon me to request, at your earliest convenience, an\r\n      explanation of this evening’s occurrences at your chambers. In\r\n      the event of your declining this request, Mr. P. will be happy to\r\n      arrange, with any friend whom you may appoint, the steps\r\n      preliminary to a meeting.\r\n\r\n      With sentiments of perfect respect,\r\n\r\n      Your most humble servant,\r\n      JOHANN HERMAN.\r\n\r\n      “_To the Baron Ritzner von Jung,\r\n      August 18th, 18_—.”\r\n\r\n      Not knowing what better to do, I called upon Ritzner with this\r\n      epistle. He bowed as I presented it; then, with a grave\r\n      countenance, motioned me to a seat. Having perused the cartel, he\r\n      wrote the following reply, which I carried to Hermann.\r\n\r\n      “SIR,—Through our common friend, Mr. P., I have received your\r\n      note of this evening. Upon due reflection I frankly admit the\r\n      propriety of the explanation you suggest. This being admitted, I\r\n      still find great difficulty, (owing to the refinedly peculiar\r\n      nature of our disagreement, and of the personal affront offered\r\n      on my part,) in so wording what I have to say by way of apology,\r\n      as to meet all the minute exigencies, and all the variable\r\n      shadows, of the case. I have great reliance, however, on that\r\n      extreme delicacy of discrimination, in matters appertaining to\r\n      the rules of etiquette, for which you have been so long and so\r\n      pre-eminently distinguished. With perfect certainty, therefore,\r\n      of being comprehended, I beg leave, in lieu of offering any\r\n      sentiments of my own, to refer you to the opinions of Sieur\r\n      Hedelin, as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of\r\n      “_Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se_,” in\r\n      his “_Duelli Lex scripta, et non; aliterque_.” The nicety of your\r\n      discernment in all the matters here treated, will be sufficient,\r\n      I am assured, to convince you _that the mere circumstance of me\r\n      referring you_ to this admirable passage, ought to satisfy your\r\n      request, as a man of honor, for explanation.\r\n\r\n      “With sentiments of profound respect,\r\n\r\n      “Your most obedient servant,\r\n      “VON JUNG.”\r\n\r\n      “The Herr Johann Hermann,\r\n      August 18th, 18—”\r\n\r\n      Hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl,\r\n      which, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous\r\n      self-complacency as he came to the rigmarole about Injuriae per\r\n      applicationem, per constructionem, et per se. Having finished\r\n      reading, he begged me, with the blandest of all possible smiles,\r\n      to be seated, while he made reference to the treatise in\r\n      question. Turning to the passage specified, he read it with great\r\n      care to himself, then closed the book, and desired me, in my\r\n      character of confidential acquaintance, to express to the Baron\r\n      von Jung his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior, and, in\r\n      that of second, to assure him that the explanation offered was of\r\n      the fullest, the most honorable, and the most unequivocally\r\n      satisfactory nature.\r\n\r\n      Somewhat amazed at all this, I made my retreat to the Baron. He\r\n      seemed to receive Hermann’s amicable letter as a matter of\r\n      course, and after a few words of general conversation, went to an\r\n      inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise “_Duelli Lex\r\n      scripta, et non; aliterque_.” He handed me the volume and asked\r\n      me to look over some portion of it. I did so, but to little\r\n      purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning.\r\n      He then took the book himself, and read me a chapter aloud. To my\r\n      surprise, what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd\r\n      account of a duel between two baboons. He now explained the\r\n      mystery; showing that the volume, as it appeared _prima facie_,\r\n      was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of Du Bartas;\r\n      that is to say, the language was ingeniously framed so as to\r\n      present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility, and\r\n      even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow of meaning\r\n      existed. The key to the whole was found in leaving out every\r\n      second and third word alternately, when there appeared a series\r\n      of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern\r\n      times.\r\n\r\n      The Baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the\r\n      treatise in Hermann’s way two or three weeks before the\r\n      adventure, and that he was satisfied, from the general tenor of\r\n      his conversation, that he had studied it with the deepest\r\n      attention, and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit.\r\n      Upon this hint he proceeded. Hermann would have died a thousand\r\n      deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand\r\n      anything and everything in the universe that had ever been\r\n      written about the _duello_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIDDLING\r\n\r\nCONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE EXACT SCIENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Hey, diddle diddle\r\n      The cat and the fiddle\r\n\r\n      Since the world began there have been two Jeremys. The one wrote\r\n      a Jeremiad about usury, and was called Jeremy Bentham. He has\r\n      been much admired by Mr. John Neal, and was a great man in a\r\n      small way. The other gave name to the most important of the Exact\r\n      Sciences, and was a great man in a great way—I may say, indeed,\r\n      in the very greatest of ways.\r\n\r\n      Diddling—or the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddle—is\r\n      sufficiently well understood. Yet the fact, the deed, the thing\r\n      _diddling_, is somewhat difficult to define. We may get, however,\r\n      at a tolerably distinct conception of the matter in hand, by\r\n      defining—not the thing, diddling, in itself—but man, as an animal\r\n      that diddles. Had Plato but hit upon this, he would have been\r\n      spared the affront of the picked chicken.\r\n\r\n      Very pertinently it was demanded of Plato, why a picked chicken,\r\n      which was clearly “a biped without feathers,” was not, according\r\n      to his own definition, a man? But I am not to be bothered by any\r\n      similar query. Man is an animal that diddles, and there is no\r\n      animal that diddles but man. It will take an entire hen-coop of\r\n      picked chickens to get over that.\r\n\r\n      What constitutes the essence, the nare, the principle of diddling\r\n      is, in fact, peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats\r\n      and pantaloons. A crow thieves; a fox cheats; a weasel outwits; a\r\n      man diddles. To diddle is his destiny. “Man was made to mourn,”\r\n      says the poet. But not so:—he was made to diddle. This is his\r\n      aim—his object—his end. And for this reason when a man’s diddled\r\n      we say he’s “_done_.”\r\n\r\n      Diddling, rightly considered, is a compound, of which the\r\n      ingredients are minuteness, interest, perseverance, ingenuity,\r\n      audacity, _nonchalance_, originality, impertinence, and grin.\r\n\r\n      _Minuteness:_—Your diddler is minute. His operations are upon a\r\n      small scale. His business is retail, for cash, or approved paper\r\n      at sight. Should he ever be tempted into magnificent speculation,\r\n      he then, at once, loses his distinctive features, and becomes\r\n      what we term “financier.” This latter word conveys the diddling\r\n      idea in every respect except that of magnitude. A diddler may\r\n      thus be regarded as a banker _in petto_—a “financial operation,”\r\n      as a diddle at Brobdignag. The one is to the other, as Homer to\r\n      “Flaccus”—as a Mastodon to a mouse—as the tail of a comet to that\r\n      of a pig.\r\n\r\n      _Interest:_—Your diddler is guided by self-interest. He scorns to\r\n      diddle for the mere _sake_ of the diddle. He has an object in\r\n      view—his pocket—and yours. He regards always the main chance. He\r\n      looks to Number One. You are Number Two, and must look to\r\n      yourself.\r\n\r\n      _Perseverance:_—Your diddler perseveres. He is not readily\r\n      discouraged. Should even the banks break, he cares nothing about\r\n      it. He steadily pursues his end, and\r\n\r\n      ‘Ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto,’\r\n\r\n      so he never lets go of his game.\r\n\r\n      _Ingenuity:_—Your diddler is ingenious. He has constructiveness\r\n      large. He understands plot. He invents and circumvents. Were he\r\n      not Alexander he would be Diogenes. Were he not a diddler, he\r\n      would be a maker of patent rat-traps or an angler for trout.\r\n\r\n      _Audacity:_—Your diddler is audacious.—He is a bold man. He\r\n      carries the war into Africa. He conquers all by assault. He would\r\n      not fear the daggers of Frey Herren. With a little more prudence\r\n      Dick Turpin would have made a good diddler; with a trifle less\r\n      blarney, Daniel O’Connell; with a pound or two more brains,\r\n      Charles the Twelfth.\r\n\r\n      _Nonchalance:_—Your diddler is nonchalant. He is not at all\r\n      nervous. He never had any nerves. He is never seduced into a\r\n      flurry. He is never put out—unless put out of doors. He is\r\n      cool—cool as a cucumber. He is calm—“calm as a smile from Lady\r\n      Bury.” He is easy—easy as an old glove, or the damsels of ancient\r\n      Baiæ.\r\n\r\n      _Originality:_—Your diddler is original—conscientiously so. His\r\n      thoughts are his own. He would scorn to employ those of another.\r\n      A stale trick is his aversion. He would return a purse, I am\r\n      sure, upon discovering that he had obtained it by an unoriginal\r\n      diddle.\r\n\r\n      _Impertinence:_—Your diddler is impertinent. He swaggers. He sets\r\n      his arms a-kimbo. He thrusts his hands in his trowsers’ pockets.\r\n      He sneers in your face. He treads on your corns. He eats your\r\n      dinner, he drinks your wine, he borrows your money, he pulls your\r\n      nose, he kicks your poodle, and he kisses your wife.\r\n\r\n      _Grin:_—Your true diddler winds up all with a grin. But this\r\n      nobody sees but himself. He grins when his daily work is\r\n      done—when his allotted labors are accomplished—at night in his\r\n      own closet, and altogether for his own private entertainment. He\r\n      goes home. He locks his door. He divests himself of his clothes.\r\n      He puts out his candle. He gets into bed. He places his head upon\r\n      the pillow. All this done, and your diddler grins. This is no\r\n      hypothesis. It is a matter of course. I reason _à priori_, and a\r\n      diddle would be no diddle without a grin.\r\n\r\n      The origin of the diddle is referrable to the infancy of the\r\n      Human Race. Perhaps the first diddler was Adam. At all events, we\r\n      can trace the science back to a very remote period of antiquity.\r\n      The moderns, however, have brought it to a perfection never\r\n      dreamed of by our thick-headed progenitors. Without pausing to\r\n      speak of the “old saws,” therefore, I shall content myself with a\r\n      compendious account of some of the more “modern instances.”\r\n\r\n      A very good diddle is this. A housekeeper in want of a sofa, for\r\n      instance, is seen to go in and out of several cabinet warehouses.\r\n      At length she arrives at one offering an excellent variety. She\r\n      is accosted, and invited to enter, by a polite and voluble\r\n      individual at the door. She finds a sofa well adapted to her\r\n      views, and upon inquiring the price, is surprised and delighted\r\n      to hear a sum named at least twenty per cent. lower than her\r\n      expectations. She hastens to make the purchase, gets a bill and\r\n      receipt, leaves her address, with a request that the article be\r\n      sent home as speedily as possible, and retires amid a profusion\r\n      of bows from the shopkeeper. The night arrives and no sofa. A\r\n      servant is sent to make inquiry about the delay. The whole\r\n      transaction is denied. No sofa has been sold—no money\r\n      received—except by the diddler, who played shop-keeper for the\r\n      nonce.\r\n\r\n      Our cabinet warehouses are left entirely unattended, and thus\r\n      afford every facility for a trick of this kind. Visitors enter,\r\n      look at furniture, and depart unheeded and unseen. Should any one\r\n      wish to purchase, or to inquire the price of an article, a bell\r\n      is at hand, and this is considered amply sufficient.\r\n\r\n      Again, quite a respectable diddle is this. A well-dressed\r\n      individual enters a shop, makes a purchase to the value of a\r\n      dollar; finds, much to his vexation, that he has left his\r\n      pocket-book in another coat pocket; and so says to the\r\n      shopkeeper—\r\n\r\n      “My dear sir, never mind; just oblige me, will you, by sending\r\n      the bundle home? But stay! I really believe that I have nothing\r\n      less than a five dollar bill, even there. However, you can send\r\n      four dollars in change with the bundle, you know.”\r\n\r\n      “Very good, sir,” replies the shop-keeper, who entertains, at\r\n      once, a lofty opinion of the high-mindedness of his customer. “I\r\n      know fellows,” he says to himself, “who would just have put the\r\n      goods under their arm, and walked off with a promise to call and\r\n      pay the dollar as they came by in the afternoon.”\r\n\r\n      A boy is sent with the parcel and change. On the route, quite\r\n      accidentally, he is met by the purchaser, who exclaims:\r\n\r\n      “Ah! This is my bundle, I see—I thought you had been home with\r\n      it, long ago. Well, go on! My wife, Mrs. Trotter, will give you\r\n      the five dollars—I left instructions with her to that effect. The\r\n      change you might as well give to me—I shall want some silver for\r\n      the Post Office. Very good! One, two, is this a good\r\n      quarter?—three, four—quite right! Say to Mrs. Trotter that you\r\n      met me, and be sure now and do not loiter on the way.”\r\n\r\n      The boy doesn’t loiter at all—but he is a very long time in\r\n      getting back from his errand—for no lady of the precise name of\r\n      Mrs. Trotter is to be discovered. He consoles himself, however,\r\n      that he has not been such a fool as to leave the goods without\r\n      the money, and re-entering his shop with a self-satisfied air,\r\n      feels sensibly hurt and indignant when his master asks him what\r\n      has become of the change.\r\n\r\n      A very simple diddle, indeed, is this. The captain of a ship,\r\n      which is about to sail, is presented by an official looking\r\n      person with an unusually moderate bill of city charges. Glad to\r\n      get off so easily, and confused by a hundred duties pressing upon\r\n      him all at once, he discharges the claim forthwith. In about\r\n      fifteen minutes, another and less reasonable bill is handed him\r\n      by one who soon makes it evident that the first collector was a\r\n      diddler, and the original collection a diddle.\r\n\r\n      And here, too, is a somewhat similar thing. A steamboat is\r\n      casting loose from the wharf. A traveller, portmanteau in hand,\r\n      is discovered running toward the wharf, at full speed. Suddenly,\r\n      he makes a dead halt, stoops, and picks up something from the\r\n      ground in a very agitated manner. It is a pocket-book, and—“Has\r\n      any gentleman lost a pocketbook?” he cries. No one can say that\r\n      he has exactly lost a pocket-book; but a great excitement ensues,\r\n      when the treasure trove is found to be of value. The boat,\r\n      however, must not be detained.\r\n\r\n      “Time and tide wait for no man,” says the captain.\r\n\r\n      “For God’s sake, stay only a few minutes,” says the finder of the\r\n      book—“the true claimant will presently appear.”\r\n\r\n      “Can’t wait!” replies the man in authority; “cast off there, d’ye\r\n      hear?”\r\n\r\n      “What _am_ I to do?” asks the finder, in great tribulation. “I am\r\n      about to leave the country for some years, and I cannot\r\n      conscientiously retain this large amount in my possession. I beg\r\n      your pardon, sir,” [here he addresses a gentleman on shore,] “but\r\n      you have the air of an honest man. _Will_ you confer upon me the\r\n      favor of taking charge of this pocket-book—I _know_ I can trust\r\n      you—and of advertising it? The notes, you see, amount to a very\r\n      considerable sum. The owner will, no doubt, insist upon rewarding\r\n      you for your trouble—”\r\n\r\n      “_Me!_—no, _you!_—it was you who found the book.”\r\n\r\n      “Well, if you _must_ have it so—_I_ will take a small reward—just\r\n      to satisfy your scruples. Let me see—why these notes are all\r\n      hundreds—bless my soul! a hundred is too much to take—fifty would\r\n      be quite enough, I am sure—”\r\n\r\n      “Cast off there!” says the captain.\r\n\r\n      “But then I have no change for a hundred, and upon the whole,\r\n      _you_ had better—”\r\n\r\n      “Cast off there!” says the captain.\r\n\r\n      “Never mind!” cries the gentleman on shore, who has been\r\n      examining his own pocket-book for the last minute or so—“never\r\n      mind! _I_ can fix it—here is a fifty on the Bank of North\r\n      America—throw the book.”\r\n\r\n      And the over-conscientious finder takes the fifty with marked\r\n      reluctance, and throws the gentleman the book, as desired, while\r\n      the steamboat fumes and fizzes on her way. In about half an hour\r\n      after her departure, the “large amount” is seen to be a\r\n      “counterfeit presentment,” and the whole thing a capital diddle.\r\n\r\n      A bold diddle is this. A camp-meeting, or something similar, is\r\n      to be held at a certain spot which is accessible only by means of\r\n      a free bridge. A diddler stations himself upon this bridge,\r\n      respectfully informs all passers by of the new county law, which\r\n      establishes a toll of one cent for foot passengers, two for\r\n      horses and donkeys, and so forth, and so forth. Some grumble but\r\n      all submit, and the diddler goes home a wealthier man by some\r\n      fifty or sixty dollars well earned. This taking a toll from a\r\n      great crowd of people is an excessively troublesome thing.\r\n\r\n      A neat diddle is this. A friend holds one of the diddler’s\r\n      promises to pay, filled up and signed in due form, upon the\r\n      ordinary blanks printed in red ink. The diddler purchases one or\r\n      two dozen of these blanks, and every day dips one of them in his\r\n      soup, makes his dog jump for it, and finally gives it to him as a\r\n      bonne bouche. The note arriving at maturity, the diddler, with\r\n      the diddler’s dog, calls upon the friend, and the promise to pay\r\n      is made the topic of discussion. The friend produces it from his\r\n      escritoire, and is in the act of reaching it to the diddler, when\r\n      up jumps the diddler’s dog and devours it forthwith. The diddler\r\n      is not only surprised but vexed and incensed at the absurd\r\n      behavior of his dog, and expresses his entire readiness to cancel\r\n      the obligation at any moment when the evidence of the obligation\r\n      shall be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n      A very mean diddle is this. A lady is insulted in the street by a\r\n      diddler’s accomplice. The diddler himself flies to her\r\n      assistance, and, giving his friend a comfortable thrashing,\r\n      insists upon attending the lady to her own door. He bows, with\r\n      his hand upon his heart, and most respectfully bids her adieu.\r\n      She entreats him, as her deliverer, to walk in and be introduced\r\n      to her big brother and her papa. With a sigh, he declines to do\r\n      so. “Is there no way, then, sir,” she murmurs, “in which I may be\r\n      permitted to testify my gratitude?”\r\n\r\n      “Why, yes, madam, there is. Will you be kind enough to lend me a\r\n      couple of shillings?”\r\n\r\n      In the first excitement of the moment the lady decides upon\r\n      fainting outright. Upon second thought, however, she opens her\r\n      purse-strings and delivers the specie. Now this, I say, is a\r\n      diddle minute—for one entire moiety of the sum borrowed has to be\r\n      paid to the gentleman who had the trouble of performing the\r\n      insult, and who had then to stand still and be thrashed for\r\n      performing it.\r\n\r\n      Rather a small but still a scientific diddle is this. The diddler\r\n      approaches the bar of a tavern, and demands a couple of twists of\r\n      tobacco. These are handed to him, when, having slightly examined\r\n      them, he says:\r\n\r\n      “I don’t much like this tobacco. Here, take it back, and give me\r\n      a glass of brandy and water in its place.” The brandy and water\r\n      is furnished and imbibed, and the diddler makes his way to the\r\n      door. But the voice of the tavern-keeper arrests him.\r\n\r\n      “I believe, sir, you have forgotten to pay for your brandy and\r\n      water.”\r\n\r\n      “Pay for my brandy and water!—didn’t I give you the tobacco for\r\n      the brandy and water? What more would you have?”\r\n\r\n      “But, sir, if you please, I don’t remember that you paid me for\r\n      the tobacco.”\r\n\r\n      “What do you mean by that, you scoundrel?—Didn’t I give you back\r\n      your tobacco? Isn’t that your tobacco lying there? Do you expect\r\n      me to pay for what I did not take?”\r\n\r\n      “But, sir,” says the publican, now rather at a loss what to say,\r\n      “but sir—”\r\n\r\n      “But me no buts, sir,” interrupts the diddler, apparently in very\r\n      high dudgeon, and slamming the door after him, as he makes his\r\n      escape.—“But me no buts, sir, and none of your tricks upon\r\n      travellers.”\r\n\r\n      Here again is a very clever diddle, of which the simplicity is\r\n      not its least recommendation. A purse, or pocket-book, being\r\n      really lost, the loser inserts in one of the daily papers of a\r\n      large city a fully descriptive advertisement.\r\n\r\n      Whereupon our diddler copies the facts of this advertisement,\r\n      with a change of heading, of general phraseology and address. The\r\n      original, for instance, is long, and verbose, is headed “A\r\n      Pocket-Book Lost!” and requires the treasure, when found, to be\r\n      left at No. 1 Tom Street. The copy is brief, and being headed\r\n      with “Lost” only, indicates No. 2 Dick, or No. 3 Harry Street, as\r\n      the locality at which the owner may be seen. Moreover, it is\r\n      inserted in at least five or six of the daily papers of the day,\r\n      while in point of time, it makes its appearance only a few hours\r\n      after the original. Should it be read by the loser of the purse,\r\n      he would hardly suspect it to have any reference to his own\r\n      misfortune. But, of course, the chances are five or six to one,\r\n      that the finder will repair to the address given by the diddler,\r\n      rather than to that pointed out by the rightful proprietor. The\r\n      former pays the reward, pockets the treasure and decamps.\r\n\r\n      Quite an analogous diddle is this. A lady of ton has dropped,\r\n      some where in the street, a diamond ring of very unusual value.\r\n      For its recovery, she offers some forty or fifty dollars\r\n      reward—giving, in her advertisement, a very minute description of\r\n      the gem, and of its settings, and declaring that, on its\r\n      restoration at No. so and so, in such and such Avenue, the reward\r\n      would be paid instanter, without a single question being asked.\r\n      During the lady’s absence from home, a day or two afterwards, a\r\n      ring is heard at the door of No. so and so, in such and such\r\n      Avenue; a servant appears; the lady of the house is asked for and\r\n      is declared to be out, at which astounding information, the\r\n      visitor expresses the most poignant regret. His business is of\r\n      importance and concerns the lady herself. In fact, he had the\r\n      good fortune to find her diamond ring. But perhaps it would be as\r\n      well that he should call again. “By no means!” says the servant;\r\n      and “By no means!” says the lady’s sister and the lady’s\r\n      sister-in-law, who are summoned forthwith. The ring is\r\n      clamorously identified, the reward is paid, and the finder nearly\r\n      thrust out of doors. The lady returns and expresses some little\r\n      dissatisfaction with her sister and sister-in-law, because they\r\n      happen to have paid forty or fifty dollars for a fac-simile of\r\n      her diamond ring—a fac-simile made out of real pinch-beck and\r\n      unquestionable paste.\r\n\r\n      But as there is really no end to diddling, so there would be none\r\n      to this essay, were I even to hint at half the variations, or\r\n      inflections, of which this science is susceptible. I must bring\r\n      this paper, perforce, to a conclusion, and this I cannot do\r\n      better than by a summary notice of a very decent, but rather\r\n      elaborate diddle, of which our own city was made the theatre, not\r\n      very long ago, and which was subsequently repeated with success,\r\n      in other still more verdant localities of the Union. A\r\n      middle-aged gentleman arrives in town from parts unknown. He is\r\n      remarkably precise, cautious, staid, and deliberate in his\r\n      demeanor. His dress is scrupulously neat, but plain,\r\n      unostentatious. He wears a white cravat, an ample waistcoat, made\r\n      with an eye to comfort alone; thick-soled cosy-looking shoes, and\r\n      pantaloons without straps. He has the whole air, in fact, of your\r\n      well-to-do, sober-sided, exact, and respectable “man of\r\n      business,” _par excellence_—one of the stern and outwardly hard,\r\n      internally soft, sort of people that we see in the crack high\r\n      comedies—fellows whose words are so many bonds, and who are noted\r\n      for giving away guineas, in charity, with the one hand, while, in\r\n      the way of mere bargain, they exact the uttermost fraction of a\r\n      farthing with the other.\r\n\r\n      He makes much ado before he can get suited with a boarding house.\r\n      He dislikes children. He has been accustomed to quiet. His habits\r\n      are methodical—and then he would prefer getting into a private\r\n      and respectable small family, piously inclined. Terms, however,\r\n      are no object—only he must insist upon settling his bill on the\r\n      first of every month, (it is now the second) and begs his\r\n      landlady, when he finally obtains one to his mind, not on any\r\n      account to forget his instructions upon this point—but to send in\r\n      a bill, and receipt, precisely at ten o’clock, on the first day\r\n      of every month, and under no circumstances to put it off to the\r\n      second.\r\n\r\n      These arrangements made, our man of business rents an office in a\r\n      reputable rather than a fashionable quarter of the town. There is\r\n      nothing he more despises than pretense. “Where there is much\r\n      show,” he says, “there is seldom any thing very solid behind”—an\r\n      observation which so profoundly impresses his landlady’s fancy,\r\n      that she makes a pencil memorandum of it forthwith, in her great\r\n      family Bible, on the broad margin of the Proverbs of Solomon.\r\n\r\n      The next step is to advertise, after some such fashion as this,\r\n      in the principal business six-pennies of the city—the pennies are\r\n      eschewed as not “respectable”—and as demanding payment for all\r\n      advertisements in advance. Our man of business holds it as a\r\n      point of his faith that work should never be paid for until done.\r\n\r\n      “WANTED.—The advertisers, being about to commence extensive\r\n      business operations in this city, will require the services of\r\n      three or four intelligent and competent clerks, to whom a liberal\r\n      salary will be paid. The very best recommendations, not so much\r\n      for capacity, as for integrity, will be expected. Indeed, as the\r\n      duties to be performed involve high responsibilities, and large\r\n      amounts of money must necessarily pass through the hands of those\r\n      engaged, it is deemed advisable to demand a deposit of fifty\r\n      dollars from each clerk employed. No person need apply,\r\n      therefore, who is not prepared to leave this sum in the\r\n      possession of the advertisers, and who cannot furnish the most\r\n      satisfactory testimonials of morality. Young gentlemen piously\r\n      inclined will be preferred. Application should be made between\r\n      the hours of ten and eleven A. M., and four and five P. M., of\r\n      Messrs.\r\n\r\n      “Bogs, Hogs, Logs, Frogs & Co.,\r\n      “No. 110 Dog Street.”\r\n\r\n      By the thirty-first day of the month, this advertisement has\r\n      brought to the office of Messrs. Bogs, Hogs, Logs, Frogs, and\r\n      Company, some fifteen or twenty young gentlemen piously inclined.\r\n      But our man of business is in no hurry to conclude a contract\r\n      with any—no man of business is ever precipitate—and it is not\r\n      until the most rigid catechism in respect to the piety of each\r\n      young gentleman’s inclination, that his services are engaged and\r\n      his fifty dollars receipted for, just by way of proper\r\n      precaution, on the part of the respectable firm of Bogs, Hogs,\r\n      Logs, Frogs, and Company. On the morning of the first day of the\r\n      next month, the landlady does not present her bill, according to\r\n      promise—a piece of neglect for which the comfortable head of the\r\n      house ending in ogs would no doubt have chided her severely,\r\n      could he have been prevailed upon to remain in town a day or two\r\n      for that purpose.\r\n\r\n      As it is, the constables have had a sad time of it, running\r\n      hither and thither, and all they can do is to declare the man of\r\n      business most emphatically, a “hen knee high”—by which some\r\n      persons imagine them to imply that, in fact, he is n. e. i.—by\r\n      which again the very classical phrase _non est inventus_, is\r\n      supposed to be understood. In the meantime the young gentlemen,\r\n      one and all, are somewhat less piously inclined than before,\r\n      while the landlady purchases a shilling’s worth of the Indian\r\n      rubber, and very carefully obliterates the pencil memorandum that\r\n      some fool has made in her great family Bible, on the broad margin\r\n      of the Proverbs of Solomon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANGEL OF THE ODD\r\n\r\nAN EXTRAVAGANZA.\r\n\r\n\r\n      It was a chilly November afternoon. I had just consummated an\r\n      unusually hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic _truffe_ formed\r\n      not the least important item, and was sitting alone in the\r\n      dining-room, with my feet upon the fender, and at my elbow a\r\n      small table which I had rolled up to the fire, and upon which\r\n      were some apologies for dessert, with some miscellaneous bottles\r\n      of wine, spirit and _liqueur_. In the morning I had been reading\r\n      Glover’s “Leonidas,” Wilkie’s “Epigoniad,” Lamartine’s\r\n      “Pilgrimage,” Barlow’s “Columbiad,” Tuckermann’s “Sicily,” and\r\n      Griswold’s “Curiosities”; I am willing to confess, therefore,\r\n      that I now felt a little stupid. I made effort to arouse myself\r\n      by aid of frequent Lafitte, and, all failing, I betook myself to\r\n      a stray newspaper in despair. Having carefully perused the column\r\n      of “houses to let,” and the column of “dogs lost,” and then the\r\n      two columns of “wives and apprentices runaway,” I attacked with\r\n      great resolution the editorial matter, and, reading it from\r\n      beginning to end without understanding a syllable, conceived the\r\n      possibility of its being Chinese, and so re-read it from the end\r\n      to the beginning, but with no more satisfactory result. I was\r\n      about throwing away, in disgust,\r\n\r\n     “This folio of four pages, happy work\r\n     Which not even critics criticise,”\r\n\r\n      when I felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which\r\n      follows:\r\n\r\n      “The avenues to death are numerous and strange. A London paper\r\n      mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause. He was\r\n      playing at ‘puff the dart,’ which is played with a long needle\r\n      inserted in some worsted, and blown at a target through a tin\r\n      tube. He placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube, and\r\n      drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force,\r\n      drew the needle into his throat. It entered the lungs, and in a\r\n      few days killed him.”\r\n\r\n      Upon seeing this I fell into a great rage, without exactly\r\n      knowing why. “This thing,” I exclaimed, “is a contemptible\r\n      falsehood—a poor hoax—the lees of the invention of some pitiable\r\n      penny-a-liner—of some wretched concoctor of accidents in\r\n      Cocaigne. These fellows, knowing the extravagant gullibility of\r\n      the age, set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable\r\n      possibilities—-of odd accidents, as they term them; but to a\r\n      reflecting intellect (like mine,” I added, in parenthesis,\r\n      putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose,) “to\r\n      a contemplative understanding such as I myself possess, it seems\r\n      evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these ‘odd\r\n      accidents’ is by far the oddest accident of all. For my own part,\r\n      I intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the\r\n      ‘singular’ about it.”\r\n\r\n      “Mein Gott, den, vat a vool you bees for dat!” replied one of the\r\n      most remarkable voices I ever heard. At first I took it for a\r\n      rumbling in my ears—such as a man sometimes experiences when\r\n      getting very drunk—but, upon second thought, I considered the\r\n      sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty\r\n      barrel beaten with a big stick; and, in fact, this I should have\r\n      concluded it to be, but for the articulation of the syllables and\r\n      words. I am by no means naturally nervous, and the very few\r\n      glasses of Lafitte which I had sipped served to embolden me no\r\n      little, so that I felt nothing of trepidation, but merely\r\n      uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement, and looked carefully\r\n      around the room for the intruder. I could not, however, perceive\r\n      any one at all.\r\n\r\n      “Humph!” resumed the voice, as I continued my survey, “you mus pe\r\n      so dronk as de pig, den, for not zee me as I zit here at your\r\n      zide.”\r\n\r\n      Hereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose,\r\n      and there, sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a\r\n      personage nondescript, although not altogether indescribable. His\r\n      body was a wine-pipe, or a rum-puncheon, or something of that\r\n      character, and had a truly Falstaffian air. In its nether\r\n      extremity were inserted two kegs, which seemed to answer all the\r\n      purposes of legs. For arms there dangled from the upper portion\r\n      of the carcass two tolerably long bottles, with the necks outward\r\n      for hands. All the head that I saw the monster possessed of was\r\n      one of those Hessian canteens which resemble a large snuff-box\r\n      with a hole in the middle of the lid. This canteen (with a funnel\r\n      on its top, like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes) was set\r\n      on edge upon the puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and\r\n      through this hole, which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a\r\n      very precise old maid, the creature was emitting certain rumbling\r\n      and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible\r\n      talk.\r\n\r\n      “I zay,” said he, “you mos pe dronk as de pig, vor zit dare and\r\n      not zee me zit ere; and I zay, doo, you mos pe pigger vool as de\r\n      goose, vor to dispelief vat iz print in de print. ’Tiz de\r\n      troof—dat it iz—eberry vord ob it.”\r\n\r\n      “Who are you, pray?” said I, with much dignity, although somewhat\r\n      puzzled; “how did you get here? and what is it you are talking\r\n      about?”\r\n\r\n      “Az vor ow I com’d ere,” replied the figure, “dat iz none of your\r\n      pizzness; and as vor vat I be talking apout, I be talk apout vat\r\n      I tink proper; and as vor who I be, vy dat is de very ting I\r\n      com’d here for to let you zee for yourzelf.”\r\n\r\n      “You are a drunken vagabond,” said I, “and I shall ring the bell\r\n      and order my footman to kick you into the street.”\r\n\r\n      “He! he! he!” said the fellow, “hu! hu! hu! dat you can’t do.”\r\n\r\n      “Can’t do!” said I, “what do you mean?—I can’t do what?”\r\n\r\n      “Ring de pell,” he replied, attempting a grin with his little\r\n      villanous mouth.\r\n\r\n      Upon this I made an effort to get up, in order to put my threat\r\n      into execution; but the ruffian just reached across the table\r\n      very deliberately, and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the\r\n      neck of one of the long bottles, knocked me back into the\r\n      arm-chair from which I had half arisen. I was utterly astounded;\r\n      and, for a moment, was quite at a loss what to do. In the\r\n      meantime, he continued his talk.\r\n\r\n      “You zee,” said he, “it iz te bess vor zit still; and now you\r\n      shall know who I pe. Look at me! zee! I am te _Angel ov te Odd_.”\r\n\r\n      “And odd enough, too,” I ventured to reply; “but I was always\r\n      under the impression that an angel had wings.”\r\n\r\n      “Te wing!” he cried, highly incensed, “vat I pe do mit te wing?\r\n      Mein Gott! do you take me vor a shicken?”\r\n\r\n      “No—oh no!” I replied, much alarmed, “you are no\r\n      chicken—certainly not.”\r\n\r\n      “Well, den, zit still and pehabe yourself, or I’ll rap you again\r\n      mid me vist. It iz te shicken ab te wing, und te owl ab te wing,\r\n      und te imp ab te wing, und te head-teuffel ab te wing. Te angel\r\n      ab _not_ te wing, and I am te _Angel ov te Odd_.”\r\n\r\n      “And your business with me at present is—is—”\r\n\r\n      “My pizzness!” ejaculated the thing, “vy vat a low bred buppy you\r\n      mos pe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness!”\r\n\r\n      This language was rather more than I could bear, even from an\r\n      angel; so, plucking up courage, I seized a salt-cellar which lay\r\n      within reach, and hurled it at the head of the intruder. Either\r\n      he dodged, however, or my aim was inaccurate; for all I\r\n      accomplished was the demolition of the crystal which protected\r\n      the dial of the clock upon the mantel-piece. As for the Angel, he\r\n      evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard\r\n      consecutive raps upon the forehead as before. These reduced me at\r\n      once to submission, and I am almost ashamed to confess that\r\n      either through pain or vexation, there came a few tears into my\r\n      eyes.\r\n\r\n      “Mein Gott!” said the Angel of the Odd, apparently much softened\r\n      at my distress; “mein Gott, te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry\r\n      zorry. You mos not trink it so strong—you mos put te water in te\r\n      wine. Here, trink dis, like a goot veller, und don’t gry\r\n      now—don’t!”\r\n\r\n      Hereupon the Angel of the Odd replenished my goblet (which was\r\n      about a third full of Port) with a colorless fluid that he poured\r\n      from one of his hand bottles. I observed that these bottles had\r\n      labels about their necks, and that these labels were inscribed\r\n      “Kirschenwasser.”\r\n\r\n      The considerate kindness of the Angel mollified me in no little\r\n      measure; and, aided by the water with which he diluted my Port\r\n      more than once, I at length regained sufficient temper to listen\r\n      to his very extraordinary discourse. I cannot pretend to recount\r\n      all that he told me, but I gleaned from what he said that he was\r\n      the genius who presided over the _contretemps_ of mankind, and\r\n      whose business it was to bring about the _odd accidents_ which\r\n      are continually astonishing the skeptic. Once or twice, upon my\r\n      venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his\r\n      pretensions, he grew very angry indeed, so that at length I\r\n      considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all, and let him\r\n      have his own way. He talked on, therefore, at great length, while\r\n      I merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut, and amused\r\n      myself with munching raisins and filliping the stems about the\r\n      room. But, by and by, the Angel suddenly construed this behavior\r\n      of mine into contempt. He arose in a terrible passion, slouched\r\n      his funnel down over his eyes, swore a vast oath, uttered a\r\n      threat of some character which I did not precisely comprehend,\r\n      and finally made me a low bow and departed, wishing me, in the\r\n      language of the archbishop in Gil-Blas, “_beaucoup de bonheur et\r\n      un peu plus de bon sens_.”\r\n\r\n      His departure afforded me relief. The _very_ few glasses of\r\n      Lafitte that I had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy,\r\n      and I felt inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty\r\n      minutes, as is my custom after dinner. At six I had an\r\n      appointment of consequence, which it was quite indispensable that\r\n      I should keep. The policy of insurance for my dwelling house had\r\n      expired the day before; and, some dispute having arisen, it was\r\n      agreed that, at six, I should meet the board of directors of the\r\n      company and settle the terms of a renewal. Glancing upward at the\r\n      clock on the mantel-piece, (for I felt too drowsy to take out my\r\n      watch), I had the pleasure to find that I had still twenty-five\r\n      minutes to spare. It was half past five; I could easily walk to\r\n      the insurance office in five minutes; and my usual siestas had\r\n      never been known to exceed five and twenty. I felt sufficiently\r\n      safe, therefore, and composed myself to my slumbers forthwith.\r\n\r\n      Having completed them to my satisfaction, I again looked toward\r\n      the time-piece and was half inclined to believe in the\r\n      possibility of odd accidents when I found that, instead of my\r\n      ordinary fifteen or twenty minutes, I had been dozing only three;\r\n      for it still wanted seven and twenty of the appointed hour. I\r\n      betook myself again to my nap, and at length a second time awoke,\r\n      when, to my utter amazement, it _still_ wanted twenty-seven\r\n      minutes of six. I jumped up to examine the clock, and found that\r\n      it had ceased running. My watch informed me that it was half past\r\n      seven; and, of course, having slept two hours, I was too late for\r\n      my appointment. “It will make no difference,” I said: “I can call\r\n      at the office in the morning and apologize; in the meantime what\r\n      can be the matter with the clock?” Upon examining it I discovered\r\n      that one of the raisin stems which I had been filliping about the\r\n      room during the discourse of the Angel of the Odd, had flown\r\n      through the fractured crystal, and lodging, singularly enough, in\r\n      the key-hole, with an end projecting outward, had thus arrested\r\n      the revolution of the minute hand.\r\n\r\n      “Ah!” said I, “I see how it is. This thing speaks for itself. A\r\n      natural accident, such as _will_ happen now and then!”\r\n\r\n      I gave the matter no further consideration, and at my usual hour\r\n      retired to bed. Here, having placed a candle upon a reading stand\r\n      at the bed head, and having made an attempt to peruse some pages\r\n      of the “Omnipresence of the Deity,” I unfortunately fell asleep\r\n      in less than twenty seconds, leaving the light burning as it was.\r\n\r\n      My dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the Angel of\r\n      the Odd. Methought he stood at the foot of the couch, drew aside\r\n      the curtains, and, in the hollow, detestable tones of a rum\r\n      puncheon, menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the\r\n      contempt with which I had treated him. He concluded a long\r\n      harangue by taking off his funnel-cap, inserting the tube into my\r\n      gullet, and thus deluging me with an ocean of Kirschenwässer,\r\n      which he poured, in a continuous flood, from one of the long\r\n      necked bottles that stood him instead of an arm. My agony was at\r\n      length insufferable, and I awoke just in time to perceive that a\r\n      rat had ran off with the lighted candle from the stand, but _not_\r\n      in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the\r\n      hole. Very soon, a strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils;\r\n      the house, I clearly perceived, was on fire. In a few minutes the\r\n      blaze broke forth with violence, and in an incredibly brief\r\n      period the entire building was wrapped in flames. All egress from\r\n      my chamber, except through a window, was cut off. The crowd,\r\n      however, quickly procured and raised a long ladder. By means of\r\n      this I was descending rapidly, and in apparent safety, when a\r\n      huge hog, about whose rotund stomach, and indeed about whose\r\n      whole air and physiognomy, there was something which reminded me\r\n      of the Angel of the Odd,—when this hog, I say, which hitherto had\r\n      been quietly slumbering in the mud, took it suddenly into his\r\n      head that his left shoulder needed scratching, and could find no\r\n      more convenient rubbing-post than that afforded by the foot of\r\n      the ladder. In an instant I was precipitated and had the\r\n      misfortune to fracture my arm.\r\n\r\n      This accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more\r\n      serious loss of my hair, the whole of which had been singed off\r\n      by the fire, predisposed me to serious impressions, so that,\r\n      finally, I made up my mind to take a wife. There was a rich widow\r\n      disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband, and to her\r\n      wounded spirit I offered the balm of my vows. She yielded a\r\n      reluctant consent to my prayers. I knelt at her feet in gratitude\r\n      and adoration. She blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into\r\n      close contact with those supplied me, temporarily, by Grandjean.\r\n      I know not how the entanglement took place, but so it was. I\r\n      arose with a shining pate, wigless; she in disdain and wrath,\r\n      half buried in alien hair. Thus ended my hopes of the widow by an\r\n      accident which could not have been anticipated, to be sure, but\r\n      which the natural sequence of events had brought about.\r\n\r\n      Without despairing, however, I undertook the siege of a less\r\n      implacable heart. The fates were again propitious for a brief\r\n      period; but again a trivial incident interfered. Meeting my\r\n      betrothed in an avenue thronged with the _élite_ of the city, I\r\n      was hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows,\r\n      when a small particle of some foreign matter, lodging in the\r\n      corner of my eye, rendered me, for the moment, completely blind.\r\n      Before I could recover my sight, the lady of my love had\r\n      disappeared—irreparably affronted at what she chose to consider\r\n      my premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted. While I\r\n      stood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident, (which might\r\n      have happened, nevertheless, to any one under the sun), and while\r\n      I still continued incapable of sight, I was accosted by the Angel\r\n      of the Odd, who proffered me his aid with a civility which I had\r\n      no reason to expect. He examined my disordered eye with much\r\n      gentleness and skill, informed me that I had a drop in it, and\r\n      (whatever a “drop” was) took it out, and afforded me relief.\r\n\r\n      I now considered it high time to die, (since fortune had so\r\n      determined to persecute me,) and accordingly made my way to the\r\n      nearest river. Here, divesting myself of my clothes, (for there\r\n      is no reason why we cannot die as we were born), I threw myself\r\n      headlong into the current; the sole witness of my fate being a\r\n      solitary crow that had been seduced into the eating of\r\n      brandy-saturated corn, and so had staggered away from his\r\n      fellows. No sooner had I entered the water than this bird took it\r\n      into its head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of\r\n      my apparel. Postponing, therefore, for the present, my suicidal\r\n      design, I just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of\r\n      my coat, and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the\r\n      nimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would\r\n      admit. But my evil destiny attended me still. As I ran at full\r\n      speed, with my nose up in the atmosphere, and intent only upon\r\n      the purloiner of my property, I suddenly perceived that my feet\r\n      rested no longer upon _terra-firma_; the fact is, I had thrown\r\n      myself over a precipice, and should inevitably have been dashed\r\n      to pieces but for my good fortune in grasping the end of a long\r\n      guide-rope, which depended from a passing balloon.\r\n\r\n      As soon as I sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the\r\n      terrific predicament in which I stood or rather hung, I exerted\r\n      all the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the\r\n      æronaut overhead. But for a long time I exerted myself in vain.\r\n      Either the fool could not, or the villain would not perceive me.\r\n      Meantime the machine rapidly soared, while my strength even more\r\n      rapidly failed. I was soon upon the point of resigning myself to\r\n      my fate, and dropping quietly into the sea, when my spirits were\r\n      suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above, which\r\n      seemed to be lazily humming an opera air. Looking up, I perceived\r\n      the Angel of the Odd. He was leaning with his arms folded, over\r\n      the rim of the car; and with a pipe in his mouth, at which he\r\n      puffed leisurely, seemed to be upon excellent terms with himself\r\n      and the universe. I was too much exhausted to speak, so I merely\r\n      regarded him with an imploring air.\r\n\r\n      For several minutes, although he looked me full in the face, he\r\n      said nothing. At length removing carefully his meerschaum from\r\n      the right to the left corner of his mouth, he condescended to\r\n      speak.\r\n\r\n      “Who pe you,” he asked, “und what der teuffel you pe do dare?”\r\n\r\n      To this piece of impudence, cruelty and affectation, I could\r\n      reply only by ejaculating the monosyllable “Help!”\r\n\r\n      “Elp!” echoed the ruffian—“not I. Dare iz te pottle—elp yourself,\r\n      und pe tam’d!”\r\n\r\n      With these words he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwasser\r\n      which, dropping precisely upon the crown of my head, caused me to\r\n      imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out. Impressed with\r\n      this idea, I was about to relinquish my hold and give up the\r\n      ghost with a good grace, when I was arrested by the cry of the\r\n      Angel, who bade me hold on.\r\n\r\n      “Old on!” he said; “don’t pe in te urry—don’t. Will you pe take\r\n      de odder pottle, or ave you pe got zober yet and come to your\r\n      zenzes?”\r\n\r\n      I made haste, hereupon, to nod my head twice—once in the\r\n      negative, meaning thereby that I would prefer not taking the\r\n      other bottle at present—and once in the affirmative, intending\r\n      thus to imply that I _was_ sober and _had_ positively come to my\r\n      senses. By these means I somewhat softened the Angel.\r\n\r\n      “Und you pelief, ten,” he inquired, “at te last? You pelief, ten,\r\n      in te possibilty of te odd?”\r\n\r\n      I again nodded my head in assent.\r\n\r\n      “Und you ave pelief in _me_, te Angel of te Odd?”\r\n\r\n      I nodded again.\r\n\r\n      “Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool?”\r\n\r\n      I nodded once more.\r\n\r\n      “Put your right hand into your left hand preeches pocket, ten, in\r\n      token ov your vull zubmizzion unto te Angel ov te Odd.”\r\n\r\n      This thing, for very obvious reasons, I found it quite impossible\r\n      to do. In the first place, my left arm had been broken in my fall\r\n      from the ladder, and, therefore, had I let go my hold with the\r\n      right hand, I must have let go altogether. In the second place, I\r\n      could have no breeches until I came across the crow. I was\r\n      therefore obliged, much to my regret, to shake my head in the\r\n      negative—intending thus to give the Angel to understand that I\r\n      found it inconvenient, just at that moment, to comply with his\r\n      very reasonable demand! No sooner, however, had I ceased shaking\r\n      my head than—\r\n\r\n      “Go to der teuffel, ten!” roared the Angel of the Odd.\r\n\r\n      In pronouncing these words, he drew a sharp knife across the\r\n      guide-rope by which I was suspended, and as we then happened to\r\n      be precisely over my own house, (which, during my peregrinations,\r\n      had been handsomely rebuilt,) it so occurred that I tumbled\r\n      headlong down the ample chimney and alit upon the dining-room\r\n      hearth.\r\n\r\n      Upon coming to my senses, (for the fall had very thoroughly\r\n      stunned me,) I found it about four o’clock in the morning. I lay\r\n      outstretched where I had fallen from the balloon. My head\r\n      grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished fire, while my feet\r\n      reposed upon the wreck of a small table, overthrown, and amid the\r\n      fragments of a miscellaneous dessert, intermingled with a\r\n      newspaper, some broken glass and shattered bottles, and an empty\r\n      jug of the Schiedam Kirschenwasser. Thus revenged himself the\r\n      Angel of the Odd.\r\n\r\n      [Mabbott states that Griswold “obviously had a revised form” for\r\n      use in the 1856 volume of Poe’s works. Mabbott does not\r\n      substantiate this claim, but it is surely not unreasonable. An\r\n      editor, and even typographical errors, may have produced nearly\r\n      all of the very minor changes made in this version. (Indeed, two\r\n      very necessary words were clearly dropped by accident.) An editor\r\n      might have corrected “Wickliffe’s ‘Epigoniad’” to “Wilkie’s\r\n      ‘Epigoniad’,” but is unlikely to have added “Tuckerman’s\r\n      ‘Sicily’” to the list of books read by the narrator. Griswold was\r\n      not above forgery (in Poe’s letters) when it suited his purpose,\r\n      but would have too little to gain by such an effort in this\r\n      instance.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMELLONTA TAUTA\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITORS OF THE LADY’S BOOK:\r\n\r\n\r\n      I have the honor of sending you, for your magazine, an article\r\n      which I hope you will be able to comprehend rather more\r\n      distinctly than I do myself. It is a translation, by my friend,\r\n      Martin Van Buren Mavis, (sometimes called the “Poughkeepsie\r\n      Seer”) of an odd-looking MS. which I found, about a year ago,\r\n      tightly corked up in a jug floating in the Mare Tenebrarum—a sea\r\n      well described by the Nubian geographer, but seldom visited\r\n      now-a-days, except for the transcendentalists and divers for\r\n      crotchets.\r\n\r\n      Truly yours,\r\n\r\n      EDGAR A. POE\r\n\r\n{this paragraph not in the volume—ED}\r\n\r\nON BOARD BALLOON “SKYLARK”\r\n\r\n      _April_, 1, 2848\r\n\r\n      Now, my dear friend—now, for your sins, you are to suffer the\r\n      infliction of a long gossiping letter. I tell you distinctly that\r\n      I am going to punish you for all your impertinences by being as\r\n      tedious, as discursive, as incoherent and as unsatisfactory as\r\n      possible. Besides, here I am, cooped up in a dirty balloon, with\r\n      some one or two hundred of the canaille, all bound on a pleasure\r\n      excursion, (what a funny idea some people have of pleasure!) and\r\n      I have no prospect of touching terra firma for a month at least.\r\n      Nobody to talk to. Nothing to do. When one has nothing to do,\r\n      then is the time to correspond with ones friends. You perceive,\r\n      then, why it is that I write you this letter—it is on account of\r\n      my ennui and your sins.\r\n\r\n      Get ready your spectacles and make up your mind to be annoyed. I\r\n      mean to write at you every day during this odious voyage.\r\n\r\n      Heigho! when will any Invention visit the human pericranium? Are\r\n      we forever to be doomed to the thousand inconveniences of the\r\n      balloon? Will nobody contrive a more expeditious mode of\r\n      progress? The jog-trot movement, to my thinking, is little less\r\n      than positive torture. Upon my word we have not made more than a\r\n      hundred miles the hour since leaving home! The very birds beat\r\n      us—at least some of them. I assure you that I do not exaggerate\r\n      at all. Our motion, no doubt, seems slower than it actually\r\n      is—this on account of our having no objects about us by which to\r\n      estimate our velocity, and on account of our going with the wind.\r\n      To be sure, whenever we meet a balloon we have a chance of\r\n      perceiving our rate, and then, I admit, things do not appear so\r\n      very bad. Accustomed as I am to this mode of travelling, I cannot\r\n      get over a kind of giddiness whenever a balloon passes us in a\r\n      current directly overhead. It always seems to me like an immense\r\n      bird of prey about to pounce upon us and carry us off in its\r\n      claws. One went over us this morning about sunrise, and so nearly\r\n      overhead that its drag-rope actually brushed the network\r\n      suspending our car, and caused us very serious apprehension. Our\r\n      captain said that if the material of the bag had been the\r\n      trumpery varnished “silk” of five hundred or a thousand years\r\n      ago, we should inevitably have been damaged. This silk, as he\r\n      explained it to me, was a fabric composed of the entrails of a\r\n      species of earth-worm. The worm was carefully fed on mulberries—a\r\n      kind of fruit resembling a water-melon—and, when sufficiently\r\n      fat, was crushed in a mill. The paste thus arising was called\r\n      papyrus in its primary state, and went through a variety of\r\n      processes until it finally became “silk.” Singular to relate, it\r\n      was once much admired as an article of female dress! Balloons\r\n      were also very generally constructed from it. A better kind of\r\n      material, it appears, was subsequently found in the down\r\n      surrounding the seed-vessels of a plant vulgarly called\r\n      euphorbium, and at that time botanically termed milk-weed. This\r\n      latter kind of silk was designated as silk-buckingham, on account\r\n      of its superior durability, and was usually prepared for use by\r\n      being varnished with a solution of gum caoutchouc—a substance\r\n      which in some respects must have resembled the gutta percha now\r\n      in common use. This caoutchouc was occasionally called Indian\r\n      rubber or rubber of twist, and was no doubt one of the numerous\r\n      fungi. Never tell me again that I am not at heart an antiquarian.\r\n\r\n      Talking of drag-ropes—our own, it seems, has this moment knocked\r\n      a man overboard from one of the small magnetic propellers that\r\n      swarm in ocean below us—a boat of about six thousand tons, and,\r\n      from all accounts, shamefully crowded. These diminutive barques\r\n      should be prohibited from carrying more than a definite number of\r\n      passengers. The man, of course, was not permitted to get on board\r\n      again, and was soon out of sight, he and his life-preserver. I\r\n      rejoice, my dear friend, that we live in an age so enlightened\r\n      that no such a thing as an individual is supposed to exist. It is\r\n      the mass for which the true Humanity cares. By-the-by, talking of\r\n      Humanity, do you know that our immortal Wiggins is not so\r\n      original in his views of the Social Condition and so forth, as\r\n      his contemporaries are inclined to suppose? Pundit assures me\r\n      that the same ideas were put nearly in the same way, about a\r\n      thousand years ago, by an Irish philosopher called Furrier, on\r\n      account of his keeping a retail shop for cat peltries and other\r\n      furs. Pundit knows, you know; there can be no mistake about it.\r\n      How very wonderfully do we see verified every day, the profound\r\n      observation of the Hindoo Aries Tottle (as quoted by\r\n      Pundit)—“Thus must we say that, not once or twice, or a few\r\n      times, but with almost infinite repetitions, the same opinions\r\n      come round in a circle among men.”\r\n\r\n      April 2.—Spoke to-day the magnetic cutter in charge of the middle\r\n      section of floating telegraph wires. I learn that when this\r\n      species of telegraph was first put into operation by Horse, it\r\n      was considered quite impossible to convey the wires over sea, but\r\n      now we are at a loss to comprehend where the difficulty lay! So\r\n      wags the world. Tempora mutantur—excuse me for quoting the\r\n      Etruscan. What would we do without the Atalantic telegraph?\r\n      (Pundit says Atlantic was the ancient adjective.) We lay to a few\r\n      minutes to ask the cutter some questions, and learned, among\r\n      other glorious news, that civil war is raging in Africa, while\r\n      the plague is doing its good work beautifully both in Yurope and\r\n      Ayesher. Is it not truly remarkable that, before the magnificent\r\n      light shed upon philosophy by Humanity, the world was accustomed\r\n      to regard War and Pestilence as calamities? Do you know that\r\n      prayers were actually offered up in the ancient temples to the\r\n      end that these evils (!) might not be visited upon mankind? Is it\r\n      not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of\r\n      interest our forefathers acted? Were they so blind as not to\r\n      perceive that the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only\r\n      so much positive advantage to the mass!\r\n\r\n      April 3.—It is really a very fine amusement to ascend the\r\n      rope-ladder leading to the summit of the balloon-bag, and thence\r\n      survey the surrounding world. From the car below you know the\r\n      prospect is not so comprehensive—you can see little vertically.\r\n      But seated here (where I write this) in the luxuriously-cushioned\r\n      open piazza of the summit, one can see everything that is going\r\n      on in all directions. Just now there is quite a crowd of balloons\r\n      in sight, and they present a very animated appearance, while the\r\n      air is resonant with the hum of so many millions of human voices.\r\n      I have heard it asserted that when Yellow or (Pundit will have\r\n      it) Violet, who is supposed to have been the first aeronaut,\r\n      maintained the practicability of traversing the atmosphere in all\r\n      directions, by merely ascending or descending until a favorable\r\n      current was attained, he was scarcely hearkened to at all by his\r\n      contemporaries, who looked upon him as merely an ingenious sort\r\n      of madman, because the philosophers (?) of the day declared the\r\n      thing impossible. Really now it does seem to me quite\r\n      unaccountable how any thing so obviously feasible could have\r\n      escaped the sagacity of the ancient savans. But in all ages the\r\n      great obstacles to advancement in Art have been opposed by the\r\n      so-called men of science. To be sure, our men of science are not\r\n      quite so bigoted as those of old:—oh, I have something so queer\r\n      to tell you on this topic. Do you know that it is not more than a\r\n      thousand years ago since the metaphysicians consented to relieve\r\n      the people of the singular fancy that there existed but two\r\n      possible roads for the attainment of Truth! Believe it if you\r\n      can! It appears that long, long ago, in the night of Time, there\r\n      lived a Turkish philosopher (or Hindoo possibly) called Aries\r\n      Tottle. This person introduced, or at all events propagated what\r\n      was termed the deductive or a priori mode of investigation. He\r\n      started with what he maintained to be axioms or “self-evident\r\n      truths,” and thence proceeded “logically” to results. His\r\n      greatest disciples were one Neuclid, and one Cant. Well, Aries\r\n      Tottle flourished supreme until advent of one Hog, surnamed the\r\n      “Ettrick Shepherd,” who preached an entirely different system,\r\n      which he called the a posteriori or inductive. His plan referred\r\n      altogether to Sensation. He proceeded by observing, analyzing,\r\n      and classifying facts-instantiae naturae, as they were affectedly\r\n      called—into general laws. Aries Tottle’s mode, in a word, was\r\n      based on noumena; Hog’s on phenomena. Well, so great was the\r\n      admiration excited by this latter system that, at its first\r\n      introduction, Aries Tottle fell into disrepute; but finally he\r\n      recovered ground and was permitted to divide the realm of Truth\r\n      with his more modern rival. The savans now maintained the\r\n      Aristotelian and Baconian roads were the sole possible avenues to\r\n      knowledge. “Baconian,” you must know, was an adjective invented\r\n      as equivalent to Hog-ian and more euphonious and dignified.\r\n\r\n      Now, my dear friend, I do assure you, most positively, that I\r\n      represent this matter fairly, on the soundest authority; and you\r\n      can easily understand how a notion so absurd on its very face\r\n      must have operated to retard the progress of all true\r\n      knowledge—which makes its advances almost invariably by intuitive\r\n      bounds. The ancient idea confined investigations to crawling; and\r\n      for hundreds of years so great was the infatuation about Hog\r\n      especially, that a virtual end was put to all thinking, properly\r\n      so called. No man dared utter a truth to which he felt himself\r\n      indebted to his Soul alone. It mattered not whether the truth was\r\n      even demonstrably a truth, for the bullet-headed savans of the\r\n      time regarded only the road by which he had attained it. They\r\n      would not even look at the end. “Let us see the means,” they\r\n      cried, “the means!” If, upon investigation of the means, it was\r\n      found to come under neither the category Aries (that is to say\r\n      Ram) nor under the category Hog, why then the savans went no\r\n      farther, but pronounced the “theorist” a fool, and would have\r\n      nothing to do with him or his truth.\r\n\r\n      Now, it cannot be maintained, even, that by the crawling system\r\n      the greatest amount of truth would be attained in any long series\r\n      of ages, for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be\r\n      compensated for by any superior certainty in the ancient modes of\r\n      investigation. The error of these Jurmains, these Vrinch, these\r\n      Inglitch, and these Amriccans (the latter, by the way, were our\r\n      own immediate progenitors), was an error quite analogous with\r\n      that of the wiseacre who fancies that he must necessarily see an\r\n      object the better the more closely he holds it to his eyes. These\r\n      people blinded themselves by details. When they proceeded\r\n      Hoggishly, their “facts” were by no means always facts—a matter\r\n      of little consequence had it not been for assuming that they were\r\n      facts and must be facts because they appeared to be such. When\r\n      they proceeded on the path of the Ram, their course was scarcely\r\n      as straight as a ram’s horn, for they never had an axiom which\r\n      was an axiom at all. They must have been very blind not to see\r\n      this, even in their own day; for even in their own day many of\r\n      the long “established” axioms had been rejected. For example—“Ex\r\n      nihilo nihil fit”; “a body cannot act where it is not”; “there\r\n      cannot exist antipodes”; “darkness cannot come out of light”—all\r\n      these, and a dozen other similar propositions, formerly admitted\r\n      without hesitation as axioms, were, even at the period of which I\r\n      speak, seen to be untenable. How absurd in these people, then, to\r\n      persist in putting faith in “axioms” as immutable bases of Truth!\r\n      But even out of the mouths of their soundest reasoners it is easy\r\n      to demonstrate the futility, the impalpability of their axioms in\r\n      general. Who was the soundest of their logicians? Let me see! I\r\n      will go and ask Pundit and be back in a minute.... Ah, here we\r\n      have it! Here is a book written nearly a thousand years ago and\r\n      lately translated from the Inglitch—which, by the way, appears to\r\n      have been the rudiment of the Amriccan. Pundit says it is\r\n      decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, Logic. The\r\n      author (who was much thought of in his day) was one Miller, or\r\n      Mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some\r\n      importance, that he had a mill-horse called Bentham. But let us\r\n      glance at the treatise!\r\n\r\n      Ah!—“Ability or inability to conceive,” says Mr. Mill, very\r\n      properly, “is in no case to be received as a criterion of\r\n      axiomatic truth.” What modern in his senses would ever think of\r\n      disputing this truism? The only wonder with us must be, how it\r\n      happened that Mr. Mill conceived it necessary even to hint at any\r\n      thing so obvious. So far good—but let us turn over another paper.\r\n      What have we here?—“Contradictories cannot both be true—that is,\r\n      cannot co-exist in nature.” Here Mr. Mill means, for example,\r\n      that a tree must be either a tree or not a tree—that it cannot be\r\n      at the same time a tree and not a tree. Very well; but I ask him\r\n      why. His reply is this—and never pretends to be any thing else\r\n      than this—“Because it is impossible to conceive that\r\n      contradictories can both be true.” But this is no answer at all,\r\n      by his own showing, for has he not just admitted as a truism that\r\n      “ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be received as\r\n      a criterion of axiomatic truth.”\r\n\r\n      Now I do not complain of these ancients so much because their\r\n      logic is, by their own showing, utterly baseless, worthless and\r\n      fantastic altogether, as because of their pompous and imbecile\r\n      proscription of all other roads of Truth, of all other means for\r\n      its attainment than the two preposterous paths—the one of\r\n      creeping and the one of crawling—to which they have dared to\r\n      confine the Soul that loves nothing so well as to soar.\r\n\r\n      By the by, my dear friend, do you not think it would have puzzled\r\n      these ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their\r\n      two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all\r\n      their truths was, in effect, attained? I mean the truth of\r\n      Gravitation. Newton owed it to Kepler. Kepler admitted that his\r\n      three laws were guessed at—these three laws of all laws which led\r\n      the great Inglitch mathematician to his principle, the basis of\r\n      all physical principle—to go behind which we must enter the\r\n      Kingdom of Metaphysics: Kepler guessed—that is to say imagined.\r\n      He was essentially a “theorist”—that word now of so much\r\n      sanctity, formerly an epithet of contempt. Would it not have\r\n      puzzled these old moles too, to have explained by which of the\r\n      two “roads” a cryptographist unriddles a cryptograph of more than\r\n      usual secrecy, or by which of the two roads Champollion directed\r\n      mankind to those enduring and almost innumerable truths which\r\n      resulted from his deciphering the Hieroglyphics.\r\n\r\n      One word more on this topic and I will be done boring you. Is it\r\n      not passing strange that, with their eternal prattling about\r\n      roads to Truth, these bigoted people missed what we now so\r\n      clearly perceive to be the great highway—that of Consistency?\r\n      Does it not seem singular how they should have failed to deduce\r\n      from the works of God the vital fact that a perfect consistency\r\n      must be an absolute truth! How plain has been our progress since\r\n      the late announcement of this proposition! Investigation has been\r\n      taken out of the hands of the ground-moles and given, as a task,\r\n      to the true and only true thinkers, the men of ardent\r\n      imagination. These latter theorize. Can you not fancy the shout\r\n      of scorn with which my words would be received by our progenitors\r\n      were it possible for them to be now looking over my shoulder?\r\n      These men, I say, theorize; and their theories are simply\r\n      corrected, reduced, systematized—cleared, little by little, of\r\n      their dross of inconsistency—until, finally, a perfect\r\n      consistency stands apparent which even the most stolid admit,\r\n      because it is a consistency, to be an absolute and an\r\n      unquestionable truth.\r\n\r\n      April 4.—The new gas is doing wonders, in conjunction with the\r\n      new improvement with gutta percha. How very safe, commodious,\r\n      manageable, and in every respect convenient are our modern\r\n      balloons! Here is an immense one approaching us at the rate of at\r\n      least a hundred and fifty miles an hour. It seems to be crowded\r\n      with people—perhaps there are three or four hundred\r\n      passengers—and yet it soars to an elevation of nearly a mile,\r\n      looking down upon poor us with sovereign contempt. Still a\r\n      hundred or even two hundred miles an hour is slow travelling\r\n      after all. Do you remember our flight on the railroad across the\r\n      Kanadaw continent?—fully three hundred miles the hour—that was\r\n      travelling. Nothing to be seen though—nothing to be done but\r\n      flirt, feast and dance in the magnificent saloons. Do you\r\n      remember what an odd sensation was experienced when, by chance,\r\n      we caught a glimpse of external objects while the cars were in\r\n      full flight? Every thing seemed unique—in one mass. For my part,\r\n      I cannot say but that I preferred the travelling by the slow\r\n      train of a hundred miles the hour. Here we were permitted to have\r\n      glass windows—even to have them open—and something like a\r\n      distinct view of the country was attainable.... Pundit says that\r\n      the route for the great Kanadaw railroad must have been in some\r\n      measure marked out about nine hundred years ago! In fact, he goes\r\n      so far as to assert that actual traces of a road are still\r\n      discernible—traces referable to a period quite as remote as that\r\n      mentioned. The track, it appears was double only; ours, you know,\r\n      has twelve paths; and three or four new ones are in preparation.\r\n      The ancient rails were very slight, and placed so close together\r\n      as to be, according to modern notions, quite frivolous, if not\r\n      dangerous in the extreme. The present width of track—fifty\r\n      feet—is considered, indeed, scarcely secure enough. For my part,\r\n      I make no doubt that a track of some sort must have existed in\r\n      very remote times, as Pundit asserts; for nothing can be clearer,\r\n      to my mind, than that, at some period—not less than seven\r\n      centuries ago, certainly—the Northern and Southern Kanadaw\r\n      continents were united; the Kanawdians, then, would have been\r\n      driven, by necessity, to a great railroad across the continent.\r\n\r\n      April 5.—I am almost devoured by _ennui_. Pundit is the only\r\n      conversible person on board; and he, poor soul! can speak of\r\n      nothing but antiquities. He has been occupied all the day in the\r\n      attempt to convince me that the ancient Amriccans governed\r\n      themselves!—did ever anybody hear of such an absurdity?—that they\r\n      existed in a sort of every-man-for-himself confederacy, after the\r\n      fashion of the “prairie dogs” that we read of in fable. He says\r\n      that they started with the queerest idea conceivable, viz: that\r\n      all men are born free and equal—this in the very teeth of the\r\n      laws of _gradation_ so visibly impressed upon all things both in\r\n      the moral and physical universe. Every man “voted,” as they\r\n      called it—that is to say meddled with public affairs—until at\r\n      length, it was discovered that what is everybody’s business is\r\n      nobody’s, and that the “Republic” (so the absurd thing was\r\n      called) was without a government at all. It is related, however,\r\n      that the first circumstance which disturbed, very particularly,\r\n      the self-complacency of the philosophers who constructed this\r\n      “Republic,” was the startling discovery that universal suffrage\r\n      gave opportunity for fraudulent schemes, by means of which any\r\n      desired number of votes might at any time be polled, without the\r\n      possibility of prevention or even detection, by any party which\r\n      should be merely villainous enough not to be ashamed of the\r\n      fraud. A little reflection upon this discovery sufficed to render\r\n      evident the consequences, which were that rascality must\r\n      predominate—in a word, that a republican government could never\r\n      be any thing but a rascally one. While the philosophers, however,\r\n      were busied in blushing at their stupidity in not having foreseen\r\n      these inevitable evils, and intent upon the invention of new\r\n      theories, the matter was put to an abrupt issue by a fellow of\r\n      the name of Mob, who took every thing into his own hands and set\r\n      up a despotism, in comparison with which those of the fabulous\r\n      Zeros and Hellofagabaluses were respectable and delectable. This\r\n      Mob (a foreigner, by-the-by), is said to have been the most\r\n      odious of all men that ever encumbered the earth. He was a giant\r\n      in stature—insolent, rapacious, filthy, had the gall of a bullock\r\n      with the heart of a hyena and the brains of a peacock. He died,\r\n      at length, by dint of his own energies, which exhausted him.\r\n      Nevertheless, he had his uses, as every thing has, however vile,\r\n      and taught mankind a lesson which to this day it is in no danger\r\n      of forgetting—never to run directly contrary to the natural\r\n      analogies. As for Republicanism, no analogy could be found for it\r\n      upon the face of the earth—unless we except the case of the\r\n      “prairie dogs,” an exception which seems to demonstrate, if\r\n      anything, that democracy is a very admirable form of\r\n      government—for dogs.\r\n\r\n      April 6.—Last night had a fine view of Alpha Lyrae, whose disk,\r\n      through our captain’s spy-glass, subtends an angle of half a\r\n      degree, looking very much as our sun does to the naked eye on a\r\n      misty day. Alpha Lyrae, although so very much larger than our\r\n      sun, by the by, resembles him closely as regards its spots, its\r\n      atmosphere, and in many other particulars. It is only within the\r\n      last century, Pundit tells me, that the binary relation existing\r\n      between these two orbs began even to be suspected. The evident\r\n      motion of our system in the heavens was (strange to say!)\r\n      referred to an orbit about a prodigious star in the centre of the\r\n      galaxy. About this star, or at all events about a centre of\r\n      gravity common to all the globes of the Milky Way and supposed to\r\n      be near Alcyone in the Pleiades, every one of these globes was\r\n      declared to be revolving, our own performing the circuit in a\r\n      period of 117,000,000 of years! We, with our present lights, our\r\n      vast telescopic improvements, and so forth, of course find it\r\n      difficult to comprehend the ground of an idea such as this. Its\r\n      first propagator was one Mudler. He was led, we must presume, to\r\n      this wild hypothesis by mere analogy in the first instance; but,\r\n      this being the case, he should have at least adhered to analogy\r\n      in its development. A great central orb was, in fact, suggested;\r\n      so far Mudler was consistent. This central orb, however,\r\n      dynamically, should have been greater than all its surrounding\r\n      orbs taken together. The question might then have been asked—“Why\r\n      do we not see it?”—we, especially, who occupy the mid region of\r\n      the cluster—the very locality near which, at least, must be\r\n      situated this inconceivable central sun. The astronomer, perhaps,\r\n      at this point, took refuge in the suggestion of non-luminosity;\r\n      and here analogy was suddenly let fall. But even admitting the\r\n      central orb non-luminous, how did he manage to explain its\r\n      failure to be rendered visible by the incalculable host of\r\n      glorious suns glaring in all directions about it? No doubt what\r\n      he finally maintained was merely a centre of gravity common to\r\n      all the revolving orbs—but here again analogy must have been let\r\n      fall. Our system revolves, it is true, about a common centre of\r\n      gravity, but it does this in connection with and in consequence\r\n      of a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the rest\r\n      of the system. The mathematical circle is a curve composed of an\r\n      infinity of straight lines; but this idea of the circle—this idea\r\n      of it which, in regard to all earthly geometry, we consider as\r\n      merely the mathematical, in contradistinction from the practical,\r\n      idea—is, in sober fact, the practical conception which alone we\r\n      have any right to entertain in respect to those Titanic circles\r\n      with which we have to deal, at least in fancy, when we suppose\r\n      our system, with its fellows, revolving about a point in the\r\n      centre of the galaxy. Let the most vigorous of human imaginations\r\n      but attempt to take a single step toward the comprehension of a\r\n      circuit so unutterable! It would scarcely be paradoxical to say\r\n      that a flash of lightning itself, travelling forever upon the\r\n      circumference of this inconceivable circle, would still forever\r\n      be travelling in a straight line. That the path of our sun along\r\n      such a circumference—that the direction of our system in such an\r\n      orbit—would, to any human perception, deviate in the slightest\r\n      degree from a straight line even in a million of years, is a\r\n      proposition not to be entertained; and yet these ancient\r\n      astronomers were absolutely cajoled, it appears, into believing\r\n      that a decisive curvature had become apparent during the brief\r\n      period of their astronomical history—during the mere point—during\r\n      the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years! How\r\n      incomprehensible, that considerations such as this did not at\r\n      once indicate to them the true state of affairs—that of the\r\n      binary revolution of our sun and Alpha Lyrae around a common\r\n      centre of gravity!\r\n\r\n      April 7.—Continued last night our astronomical amusements. Had a\r\n      fine view of the five Neptunian asteroids, and watched with much\r\n      interest the putting up of a huge impost on a couple of lintels\r\n      in the new temple at Daphnis in the moon. It was amusing to think\r\n      that creatures so diminutive as the lunarians, and bearing so\r\n      little resemblance to humanity, yet evinced a mechanical\r\n      ingenuity so much superior to our own. One finds it difficult,\r\n      too, to conceive the vast masses which these people handle so\r\n      easily, to be as light as our own reason tells us they actually\r\n      are.\r\n\r\n      April 8.—Eureka! Pundit is in his glory. A balloon from Kanadaw\r\n      spoke us to-day and threw on board several late papers; they\r\n      contain some exceedingly curious information relative to\r\n      Kanawdian or rather Amriccan antiquities. You know, I presume,\r\n      that laborers have for some months been employed in preparing the\r\n      ground for a new fountain at Paradise, the Emperor’s principal\r\n      pleasure garden. Paradise, it appears, has been, literally\r\n      speaking, an island time out of mind—that is to say, its northern\r\n      boundary was always (as far back as any record extends) a\r\n      rivulet, or rather a very narrow arm of the sea. This arm was\r\n      gradually widened until it attained its present breadth—a mile.\r\n      The whole length of the island is nine miles; the breadth varies\r\n      materially. The entire area (so Pundit says) was, about eight\r\n      hundred years ago, densely packed with houses, some of them\r\n      twenty stories high; land (for some most unaccountable reason)\r\n      being considered as especially precious just in this vicinity.\r\n      The disastrous earthquake, however, of the year 2050, so totally\r\n      uprooted and overwhelmed the town (for it was almost too large to\r\n      be called a village) that the most indefatigable of our\r\n      antiquarians have never yet been able to obtain from the site any\r\n      sufficient data (in the shape of coins, medals or inscriptions)\r\n      wherewith to build up even the ghost of a theory concerning the\r\n      manners, customs, &c., &c., &c., of the aboriginal inhabitants.\r\n      Nearly all that we have hitherto known of them is, that they were\r\n      a portion of the Knickerbocker tribe of savages infesting the\r\n      continent at its first discovery by Recorder Riker, a knight of\r\n      the Golden Fleece. They were by no means uncivilized, however,\r\n      but cultivated various arts and even sciences after a fashion of\r\n      their own. It is related of them that they were acute in many\r\n      respects, but were oddly afflicted with monomania for building\r\n      what, in the ancient Amriccan, was denominated “churches”—a kind\r\n      of pagoda instituted for the worship of two idols that went by\r\n      the names of Wealth and Fashion. In the end, it is said, the\r\n      island became, nine tenths of it, church. The women, too, it\r\n      appears, were oddly deformed by a natural protuberance of the\r\n      region just below the small of the back—although, most\r\n      unaccountably, this deformity was looked upon altogether in the\r\n      light of a beauty. One or two pictures of these singular women\r\n      have in fact, been miraculously preserved. They look very odd,\r\n      very—like something between a turkey-cock and a dromedary.\r\n\r\n      Well, these few details are nearly all that have descended to us\r\n      respecting the ancient Knickerbockers. It seems, however, that\r\n      while digging in the centre of the emperors garden, (which, you\r\n      know, covers the whole island), some of the workmen unearthed a\r\n      cubical and evidently chiseled block of granite, weighing several\r\n      hundred pounds. It was in good preservation, having received,\r\n      apparently, little injury from the convulsion which entombed it.\r\n      On one of its surfaces was a marble slab with (only think of it!)\r\n      an inscription—a legible inscription. Pundit is in ecstacies.\r\n      Upon detaching the slab, a cavity appeared, containing a leaden\r\n      box filled with various coins, a long scroll of names, several\r\n      documents which appear to resemble newspapers, with other matters\r\n      of intense interest to the antiquarian! There can be no doubt\r\n      that all these are genuine Amriccan relics belonging to the tribe\r\n      called Knickerbocker. The papers thrown on board our balloon are\r\n      filled with fac-similes of the coins, MSS., typography, &c., &c.\r\n      I copy for your amusement the Knickerbocker inscription on the\r\n      marble slab:—\r\n\r\n          This Corner Stone of a Monument to\r\n                  The Memory of\r\n                GEORGE WASHINGTON\r\n          Was Laid With Appropriate Ceremonies\r\n                    on the\r\n             19th Day of October, 1847\r\n          The anniversary of the surrender of\r\n                 Lord Cornwallis\r\n          to General Washington at Yorktown\r\n                 A. D. 1781\r\n            Under the Auspices of the\r\n          Washington Monument Association of\r\n                the city of New York\r\n\r\n      This, as I give it, is a verbatim translation done by Pundit\r\n      himself, so there can be no mistake about it. From the few words\r\n      thus preserved, we glean several important items of knowledge,\r\n      not the least interesting of which is the fact that a thousand\r\n      years ago actual monuments had fallen into disuse—as was all very\r\n      proper—the people contenting themselves, as we do now, with a\r\n      mere indication of the design to erect a monument at some future\r\n      time; a corner-stone being cautiously laid by itself “solitary\r\n      and alone” (excuse me for quoting the great American poet\r\n      Benton!), as a guarantee of the magnanimous intention. We\r\n      ascertain, too, very distinctly, from this admirable inscription,\r\n      the how as well as the where and the what, of the great surrender\r\n      in question. As to the where, it was Yorktown (wherever that\r\n      was), and as to the what, it was General Cornwallis (no doubt\r\n      some wealthy dealer in corn). He was surrendered. The inscription\r\n      commemorates the surrender of—what?—why, “of Lord Cornwallis.”\r\n      The only question is what could the savages wish him surrendered\r\n      for. But when we remember that these savages were undoubtedly\r\n      cannibals, we are led to the conclusion that they intended him\r\n      for sausage. As to the how of the surrender, no language can be\r\n      more explicit. Lord Cornwallis was surrendered (for sausage)\r\n      “under the auspices of the Washington Monument Association”—no\r\n      doubt a charitable institution for the depositing of\r\n      corner-stones.—But, Heaven bless me! what is the matter? Ah, I\r\n      see—the balloon has collapsed, and we shall have a tumble into\r\n      the sea. I have, therefore, only time enough to add that, from a\r\n      hasty inspection of the fac-similes of newspapers, &c., &c., I\r\n      find that the great men in those days among the Amriccans, were\r\n      one John, a smith, and one Zacchary, a tailor.\r\n\r\n      Good-bye, until I see you again. Whether you ever get this letter\r\n      or not is point of little importance, as I write altogether for\r\n      my own amusement. I shall cork the MS. up in a bottle, however,\r\n      and throw it into the sea.\r\n\r\n      Yours everlastingly,\r\n       PUNDITA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUC DE L’OMELETTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd stepped at once into a cooler clime.—_Cowper_.\r\n\r\n      Keats fell by a criticism. Who was it died of “The Andromache”?\r\n      {*1} Ignoble souls!—De L’Omelette perished of an ortolan.\r\n      _L’histoire en est brève_. Assist me, Spirit of Apicius!\r\n\r\n      A golden cage bore the little winged wanderer, enamored, melting,\r\n      indolent, to the _Chaussée D’Antin_, from its home in far Peru.\r\n      From its queenly possessor La Bellissima, to the Duc De\r\n      L’Omelette, six peers of the empire conveyed the happy bird.\r\n\r\n      That night the Duc was to sup alone. In the privacy of his bureau\r\n      he reclined languidly on that ottoman for which he sacrificed his\r\n      loyalty in outbidding his king—the notorious ottoman of Cadêt.\r\n\r\n      He buries his face in the pillow. The clock strikes! Unable to\r\n      restrain his feelings, his Grace swallows an olive. At this\r\n      moment the door gently opens to the sound of soft music, and lo!\r\n      the most delicate of birds is before the most enamored of men!\r\n      But what inexpressible dismay now overshadows the countenance of\r\n      the Duc?—“_Horreur!—chien! Baptiste!—l’oiseau! ah, bon Dieu! cet\r\n      oiseau modeste que tu as déshabillé de ses plumes, et que tu as\r\n      servi sans papier!_” It is superfluous to say more:—the Duc\r\n      expired in a paroxysm of disgust.\r\n\r\n      “Ha! ha! ha!” said his Grace on the third day after his decease.\r\n\r\n      “He! he! he!” replied the Devil faintly, drawing himself up with\r\n      an air of _hauteur_.\r\n\r\n      “Why, surely you are not serious,” retorted De L’Omelette. “I\r\n      have sinned—c’est vrai—but, my good sir, consider!—you have no\r\n      actual intention of putting such—such barbarous threats into\r\n      execution.”\r\n\r\n      “No _what?_” said his majesty—“come, sir, strip!”\r\n\r\n      “Strip, indeed! very pretty i’ faith! no, sir, I shall _not_\r\n      strip. Who are you, pray, that I, Duc De L’Omelette, Prince de\r\n      Foie-Gras, just come of age, author of the ‘Mazurkiad,’ and\r\n      Member of the Academy, should divest myself at your bidding of\r\n      the sweetest pantaloons ever made by Bourdon, the daintiest\r\n      _robe-de-chambre_ ever put together by Rombêrt—to say nothing of\r\n      the taking my hair out of paper—not to mention the trouble I\r\n      should have in drawing off my gloves?”\r\n\r\n      “Who am I?—ah, true! I am Baal-Zebub, Prince of the Fly. I took\r\n      thee, just now, from a rose-wood coffin inlaid with ivory. Thou\r\n      wast curiously scented, and labelled as per invoice. Belial sent\r\n      thee,—my Inspector of Cemeteries. The pantaloons, which thou\r\n      sayest were made by Bourdon, are an excellent pair of linen\r\n      drawers, and thy _robe-de-chambre_ is a shroud of no scanty\r\n      dimensions.”\r\n\r\n      “Sir!” replied the Duc, “I am not to be insulted with\r\n      impunity!—Sir! I shall take the earliest opportunity of avenging\r\n      this insult!—Sir! you shall hear from me! in the meantime _au\r\n      revoir!_”—and the Duc was bowing himself out of the Satanic\r\n      presence, when he was interrupted and brought back by a gentleman\r\n      in waiting. Hereupon his Grace rubbed his eyes, yawned, shrugged\r\n      his shoulders, reflected. Having become satisfied of his\r\n      identity, he took a bird’s eye view of his whereabouts.\r\n\r\n      The apartment was superb. Even De L’Omelette pronounced it _bien\r\n      comme il faut_. It was not its length nor its breadth,—but its\r\n      height—ah, that was appalling!—There was no ceiling—certainly\r\n      none—but a dense whirling mass of fiery-colored clouds. His\r\n      Grace’s brain reeled as he glanced upward. From above, hung a\r\n      chain of an unknown blood-red metal—its upper end lost, like the\r\n      city of Boston, _parmi les nues_. From its nether extremity swung\r\n      a large cresset. The Duc knew it to be a ruby; but from it there\r\n      poured a light so intense, so still, so terrible, Persia never\r\n      worshipped such—Gheber never imagined such—Mussulman never\r\n      dreamed of such when, drugged with opium, he has tottered to a\r\n      bed of poppies, his back to the flowers, and his face to the God\r\n      Apollo. The Duc muttered a slight oath, decidedly approbatory.\r\n\r\n      The corners of the room were rounded into niches. Three of these\r\n      were filled with statues of gigantic proportions. Their beauty\r\n      was Grecian, their deformity Egyptian, their _tout ensemble_\r\n      French. In the fourth niche the statue was veiled; it was _not_\r\n      colossal. But then there was a taper ankle, a sandalled foot. De\r\n      L’Omelette pressed his hand upon his heart, closed his eyes,\r\n      raised them, and caught his Satanic Majesty—in a blush.\r\n\r\n      But the paintings!—Kupris! Astarte! Astoreth!—a thousand and the\r\n      same! And Rafaelle has beheld them! Yes, Rafaelle has been here,\r\n      for did he not paint the—? and was he not consequently damned?\r\n      The paintings—the paintings! O luxury! O love!—who, gazing on\r\n      those forbidden beauties, shall have eyes for the dainty devices\r\n      of the golden frames that besprinkled, like stars, the hyacinth\r\n      and the porphyry walls?\r\n\r\n      But the Duc’s heart is fainting within him. He is not, however,\r\n      as you suppose, dizzy with magnificence, nor drunk with the\r\n      ecstatic breath of those innumerable censers. _C’est vrai que de\r\n      toutes ces choses il a pensé beaucoup—mais!_ The Duc De\r\n      L’Omelette is terror-stricken; for, through the lurid vista which\r\n      a single uncurtained window is affording, lo! gleams the most\r\n      ghastly of all fires!\r\n\r\n      _Le pauvre Duc!_ He could not help imagining that the glorious,\r\n      the voluptuous, the never-dying melodies which pervaded that\r\n      hall, as they passed filtered and transmuted through the alchemy\r\n      of the enchanted window-panes, were the wailings and the howlings\r\n      of the hopeless and the damned! And there, too!—there!—upon the\r\n      ottoman!—who could _he_ be?—he, the _petitmaître_—no, the\r\n      Deity—who sat as if carved in marble, _et qui sourit_, with his\r\n      pale countenance, _si amèrement?_\r\n\r\n      _Mais il faut agir_—that is to say, a Frenchman never faints\r\n      outright. Besides, his Grace hated a scene—De L’Omelette is\r\n      himself again. There were some foils upon a table—some points\r\n      also. The Duc had studied under B——; _il avait tué ses six\r\n      hommes._ Now, then, _il peut s’échapper_. He measures two points,\r\n      and, with a grace inimitable, offers his Majesty the choice.\r\n      _Horreur!_ his Majesty does not fence!\r\n\r\n      _Mais il joue!_—how happy a thought!—but his Grace had always an\r\n      excellent memory. He had dipped in the “_Diable_” of Abbé\r\n      Gualtier. Therein it is said “_que le Diable n’ose pas refuser un\r\n      jeu d’écarté._”\r\n\r\n      But the chances—the chances! True—desperate: but scarcely more\r\n      desperate than the Duc. Besides, was he not in the secret?—had he\r\n      not skimmed over Père Le Brun?—was he not a member of the Club\r\n      Vingt-un? “_Si je perds_,” said he, “_je serai deux fois perdu_—I\r\n      shall be doubly damned—_voilà tout!_ (Here his Grace shrugged his\r\n      shoulders.) _Si je gagne, je reviendrai a mes ortolans—que les\r\n      cartes soient préparées!_”\r\n\r\n      His Grace was all care, all attention—his Majesty all confidence.\r\n      A spectator would have thought of Francis and Charles. His Grace\r\n      thought of his game. His Majesty did not think; he shuffled. The\r\n      Duc cut.\r\n\r\n      The cards were dealt. The trump is turned—it is—it is—the king!\r\n      No—it was the queen. His Majesty cursed her masculine\r\n      habiliments. De L’Omelette placed his hand upon his heart.\r\n\r\n      They play. The Duc counts. The hand is out. His Majesty counts\r\n      heavily, smiles, and is taking wine. The Duc slips a card.\r\n\r\n      “_C’est à vous à faire_,” said his Majesty, cutting. His Grace\r\n      bowed, dealt, and arose from the table _en presentant le Roi_.\r\n\r\n      His Majesty looked chagrined.\r\n\r\n      Had Alexander not been Alexander, he would have been Diogenes;\r\n      and the Duc assured his antagonist in taking leave, “_que s’il\r\n      n’eût été De L’Omelette il n’aurait point d’objection d’être le\r\n      Diable._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OBLONG BOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Some years ago, I engaged passage from Charleston, S. C., to the\r\n      city of New York, in the fine packet-ship “Independence,” Captain\r\n      Hardy. We were to sail on the fifteenth of the month (June),\r\n      weather permitting; and on the fourteenth, I went on board to\r\n      arrange some matters in my state-room.\r\n\r\n      I found that we were to have a great many passengers, including a\r\n      more than usual number of ladies. On the list were several of my\r\n      acquaintances, and among other names, I was rejoiced to see that\r\n      of Mr. Cornelius Wyatt, a young artist, for whom I entertained\r\n      feelings of warm friendship. He had been with me a fellow-student\r\n      at C—— University, where we were very much together. He had the\r\n      ordinary temperament of genius, and was a compound of\r\n      misanthropy, sensibility, and enthusiasm. To these qualities he\r\n      united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human\r\n      bosom.\r\n\r\n      I observed that his name was carded upon three state-rooms; and,\r\n      upon again referring to the list of passengers, I found that he\r\n      had engaged passage for himself, wife, and two sisters—his own.\r\n      The state-rooms were sufficiently roomy, and each had two berths,\r\n      one above the other. These berths, to be sure, were so\r\n      exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one\r\n      person; still, I could not comprehend why there were three\r\n      state-rooms for these four persons. I was, just at that epoch, in\r\n      one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally\r\n      inquisitive about trifles: and I confess, with shame, that I\r\n      busied myself in a variety of ill-bred and preposterous\r\n      conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary state-room. It\r\n      was no business of mine, to be sure, but with none the less\r\n      pertinacity did I occupy myself in attempts to resolve the\r\n      enigma. At last I reached a conclusion which wrought in me great\r\n      wonder why I had not arrived at it before. “It is a servant of\r\n      course,” I said; “what a fool I am, not sooner to have thought of\r\n      so obvious a solution!” And then I again repaired to the list—but\r\n      here I saw distinctly that no servant was to come with the party,\r\n      although, in fact, it had been the original design to bring\r\n      one—for the words “and servant” had been first written and then\r\n      overscored. “Oh, extra baggage, to be sure,” I now said to\r\n      myself—“something he wishes not to be put in the hold—something\r\n      to be kept under his own eye—ah, I have it—a painting or so—and\r\n      this is what he has been bargaining about with Nicolino, the\r\n      Italian Jew.” This idea satisfied me, and I dismissed my\r\n      curiosity for the nonce.\r\n\r\n      Wyatt’s two sisters I knew very well, and most amiable and clever\r\n      girls they were. His wife he had newly married, and I had never\r\n      yet seen her. He had often talked about her in my presence,\r\n      however, and in his usual style of enthusiasm. He described her\r\n      as of surpassing beauty, wit, and accomplishment. I was,\r\n      therefore, quite anxious to make her acquaintance.\r\n\r\n      On the day in which I visited the ship (the fourteenth), Wyatt\r\n      and party were also to visit it—so the captain informed me—and I\r\n      waited on board an hour longer than I had designed, in hope of\r\n      being presented to the bride, but then an apology came. “Mrs. W.\r\n      was a little indisposed, and would decline coming on board until\r\n      to-morrow, at the hour of sailing.”\r\n\r\n      The morrow having arrived, I was going from my hotel to the\r\n      wharf, when Captain Hardy met me and said that, “owing to\r\n      circumstances” (a stupid but convenient phrase), “he rather\r\n      thought the ‘Independence’ would not sail for a day or two, and\r\n      that when all was ready, he would send up and let me know.” This\r\n      I thought strange, for there was a stiff southerly breeze; but as\r\n      “the circumstances” were not forthcoming, although I pumped for\r\n      them with much perseverance, I had nothing to do but to return\r\n      home and digest my impatience at leisure.\r\n\r\n      I did not receive the expected message from the captain for\r\n      nearly a week. It came at length, however, and I immediately went\r\n      on board. The ship was crowded with passengers, and every thing\r\n      was in the bustle attendant upon making sail. Wyatt’s party\r\n      arrived in about ten minutes after myself. There were the two\r\n      sisters, the bride, and the artist—the latter in one of his\r\n      customary fits of moody misanthropy. I was too well used to\r\n      these, however, to pay them any special attention. He did not\r\n      even introduce me to his wife—this courtesy devolving, per force,\r\n      upon his sister Marian—a very sweet and intelligent girl, who, in\r\n      a few hurried words, made us acquainted.\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Wyatt had been closely veiled; and when she raised her veil,\r\n      in acknowledging my bow, I confess that I was very profoundly\r\n      astonished. I should have been much more so, however, had not\r\n      long experience advised me not to trust, with too implicit a\r\n      reliance, the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend, the artist,\r\n      when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman. When\r\n      beauty was the theme, I well knew with what facility he soared\r\n      into the regions of the purely ideal.\r\n\r\n      The truth is, I could not help regarding Mrs. Wyatt as a\r\n      decidedly plain-looking woman. If not positively ugly, she was\r\n      not, I think, very far from it. She was dressed, however, in\r\n      exquisite taste—and then I had no doubt that she had captivated\r\n      my friend’s heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect\r\n      and soul. She said very few words, and passed at once into her\r\n      state-room with Mr. W.\r\n\r\n      My old inquisitiveness now returned. There was no servant—that\r\n      was a settled point. I looked, therefore, for the extra baggage.\r\n      After some delay, a cart arrived at the wharf, with an oblong\r\n      pine box, which was every thing that seemed to be expected.\r\n      Immediately upon its arrival we made sail, and in a short time\r\n      were safely over the bar and standing out to sea.\r\n\r\n      The box in question was, as I say, oblong. It was about six feet\r\n      in length by two and a half in breadth; I observed it\r\n      attentively, and like to be precise. Now this shape was peculiar;\r\n      and no sooner had I seen it, than I took credit to myself for the\r\n      accuracy of my guessing. I had reached the conclusion, it will be\r\n      remembered, that the extra baggage of my friend, the artist,\r\n      would prove to be pictures, or at least a picture; for I knew he\r\n      had been for several weeks in conference with Nicolino:—and now\r\n      here was a box, which, from its shape, could possibly contain\r\n      nothing in the world but a copy of Leonardo’s “Last Supper;” and\r\n      a copy of this very “Last Supper,” done by Rubini the younger, at\r\n      Florence, I had known, for some time, to be in the possession of\r\n      Nicolino. This point, therefore, I considered as sufficiently\r\n      settled. I chuckled excessively when I thought of my acumen. It\r\n      was the first time I had ever known Wyatt to keep from me any of\r\n      his artistical secrets; but here he evidently intended to steal a\r\n      march upon me, and smuggle a fine picture to New York, under my\r\n      very nose; expecting me to know nothing of the matter. I resolved\r\n      to quiz him well, now and hereafter.\r\n\r\n      One thing, however, annoyed me not a little. The box did not go\r\n      into the extra state-room. It was deposited in Wyatt’s own; and\r\n      there, too, it remained, occupying very nearly the whole of the\r\n      floor—no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his\r\n      wife;—this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it\r\n      was lettered in sprawling capitals, emitted a strong,\r\n      disagreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly disgusting odor. On\r\n      the lid were painted the words—“Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, Albany, New\r\n      York. Charge of Cornelius Wyatt, Esq. This side up. To be handled\r\n      with care.”\r\n\r\n      Now, I was aware that Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, of Albany, was the\r\n      artist’s wife’s mother,—but then I looked upon the whole address\r\n      as a mystification, intended especially for myself. I made up my\r\n      mind, of course, that the box and contents would never get\r\n      farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend, in\r\n      Chambers Street, New York.\r\n\r\n      For the first three or four days we had fine weather, although\r\n      the wind was dead ahead; having chopped round to the northward,\r\n      immediately upon our losing sight of the coast. The passengers\r\n      were, consequently, in high spirits and disposed to be social. I\r\n      must except, however, Wyatt and his sisters, who behaved stiffly,\r\n      and, I could not help thinking, uncourteously to the rest of the\r\n      party. Wyatt’s conduct I did not so much regard. He was gloomy,\r\n      even beyond his usual habit—in fact he was morose—but in him I\r\n      was prepared for eccentricity. For the sisters, however, I could\r\n      make no excuse. They secluded themselves in their staterooms\r\n      during the greater part of the passage, and absolutely refused,\r\n      although I repeatedly urged them, to hold communication with any\r\n      person on board.\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Wyatt herself was far more agreeable. That is to say, she\r\n      was chatty; and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea.\r\n      She became excessively intimate with most of the ladies; and, to\r\n      my profound astonishment, evinced no equivocal disposition to\r\n      coquet with the men. She amused us all very much. I say\r\n      “amused”—and scarcely know how to explain myself. The truth is, I\r\n      soon found that Mrs. W. was far oftener laughed at than with. The\r\n      gentlemen said little about her; but the ladies, in a little\r\n      while, pronounced her “a good-hearted thing, rather indifferent\r\n      looking, totally uneducated, and decidedly vulgar.” The great\r\n      wonder was, how Wyatt had been entrapped into such a match.\r\n      Wealth was the general solution—but this I knew to be no solution\r\n      at all; for Wyatt had told me that she neither brought him a\r\n      dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever. “He had\r\n      married,” he said, “for love, and for love only; and his bride\r\n      was far more than worthy of his love.” When I thought of these\r\n      expressions, on the part of my friend, I confess that I felt\r\n      indescribably puzzled. Could it be possible that he was taking\r\n      leave of his senses? What else could I think? He, so refined, so\r\n      intellectual, so fastidious, with so exquisite a perception of\r\n      the faulty, and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful! To be\r\n      sure, the lady seemed especially fond of him—particularly so in\r\n      his absence—when she made herself ridiculous by frequent\r\n      quotations of what had been said by her “beloved husband, Mr.\r\n      Wyatt.” The word “husband” seemed forever—to use one of her own\r\n      delicate expressions—forever “on the tip of her tongue.” In the\r\n      meantime, it was observed by all on board, that he avoided her in\r\n      the most pointed manner, and, for the most part, shut himself up\r\n      alone in his state-room, where, in fact, he might have been said\r\n      to live altogether, leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse\r\n      herself as she thought best, in the public society of the main\r\n      cabin.\r\n\r\n      My conclusion, from what I saw and heard, was, that, the artist,\r\n      by some unaccountable freak of fate, or perhaps in some fit of\r\n      enthusiastic and fanciful passion, had been induced to unite\r\n      himself with a person altogether beneath him, and that the\r\n      natural result, entire and speedy disgust, had ensued. I pitied\r\n      him from the bottom of my heart—but could not, for that reason,\r\n      quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the “Last\r\n      Supper.” For this I resolved to have my revenge.\r\n\r\n      One day he came upon deck, and, taking his arm as had been my\r\n      wont, I sauntered with him backward and forward. His gloom,\r\n      however (which I considered quite natural under the\r\n      circumstances), seemed entirely unabated. He said little, and\r\n      that moodily, and with evident effort. I ventured a jest or two,\r\n      and he made a sickening attempt at a smile. Poor fellow!—as I\r\n      thought of his wife, I wondered that he could have heart to put\r\n      on even the semblance of mirth. I determined to commence a series\r\n      of covert insinuations, or innuendoes, about the oblong box—just\r\n      to let him perceive, gradually, that I was not altogether the\r\n      butt, or victim, of his little bit of pleasant mystification. My\r\n      first observation was by way of opening a masked battery. I said\r\n      something about the “peculiar shape of _that_ box”; and, as I\r\n      spoke the words, I smiled knowingly, winked, and touched him\r\n      gently with my forefinger in the ribs.\r\n\r\n      The manner in which Wyatt received this harmless pleasantry\r\n      convinced me, at once, that he was mad. At first he stared at me\r\n      as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my\r\n      remark; but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his\r\n      brain, his eyes, in the same proportion, seemed protruding from\r\n      their sockets. Then he grew very red—then hideously pale—then, as\r\n      if highly amused with what I had insinuated, he began a loud and\r\n      boisterous laugh, which, to my astonishment, he kept up, with\r\n      gradually increasing vigor, for ten minutes or more. In\r\n      conclusion, he fell flat and heavily upon the deck. When I ran to\r\n      uplift him, to all appearance he was dead.\r\n\r\n      I called assistance, and, with much difficulty, we brought him to\r\n      himself. Upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time. At\r\n      length we bled him and put him to bed. The next morning he was\r\n      quite recovered, so far as regarded his mere bodily health. Of\r\n      his mind I say nothing, of course. I avoided him during the rest\r\n      of the passage, by advice of the captain, who seemed to coincide\r\n      with me altogether in my views of his insanity, but cautioned me\r\n      to say nothing on this head to any person on board.\r\n\r\n      Several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of\r\n      Wyatt which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which I\r\n      was already possessed. Among other things, this: I had been\r\n      nervous—drank too much strong green tea, and slept ill at\r\n      night—in fact, for two nights I could not be properly said to\r\n      sleep at all. Now, my state-room opened into the main cabin, or\r\n      dining-room, as did those of all the single men on board. Wyatt’s\r\n      three rooms were in the after-cabin, which was separated from the\r\n      main one by a slight sliding door, never locked even at night. As\r\n      we were almost constantly on a wind, and the breeze was not a\r\n      little stiff, the ship heeled to leeward very considerably; and\r\n      whenever her starboard side was to leeward, the sliding door\r\n      between the cabins slid open, and so remained, nobody taking the\r\n      trouble to get up and shut it. But my berth was in such a\r\n      position, that when my own state-room door was open, as well as\r\n      the sliding door in question (and my own door was always open on\r\n      account of the heat,) I could see into the after-cabin quite\r\n      distinctly, and just at that portion of it, too, where were\r\n      situated the state-rooms of Mr. Wyatt. Well, during two nights\r\n      (not consecutive) while I lay awake, I clearly saw Mrs. W., about\r\n      eleven o’clock upon each night, steal cautiously from the\r\n      state-room of Mr. W., and enter the extra room, where she\r\n      remained until daybreak, when she was called by her husband and\r\n      went back. That they were virtually separated was clear. They had\r\n      separate apartments—no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent\r\n      divorce; and here, after all I thought was the mystery of the\r\n      extra state-room.\r\n\r\n      There was another circumstance, too, which interested me much.\r\n      During the two wakeful nights in question, and immediately after\r\n      the disappearance of Mrs. Wyatt into the extra state-room, I was\r\n      attracted by certain singular cautious, subdued noises in that of\r\n      her husband. After listening to them for some time, with\r\n      thoughtful attention, I at length succeeded perfectly in\r\n      translating their import. They were sounds occasioned by the\r\n      artist in prying open the oblong box, by means of a chisel and\r\n      mallet—the latter being apparently muffled, or deadened, by some\r\n      soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped.\r\n\r\n      In this manner I fancied I could distinguish the precise moment\r\n      when he fairly disengaged the lid—also, that I could determine\r\n      when he removed it altogether, and when he deposited it upon the\r\n      lower berth in his room; this latter point I knew, for example,\r\n      by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the\r\n      wooden edges of the berth, as he endeavored to lay it down very\r\n      gently—there being no room for it on the floor. After this there\r\n      was a dead stillness, and I heard nothing more, upon either\r\n      occasion, until nearly daybreak; unless, perhaps, I may mention a\r\n      low sobbing, or murmuring sound, so very much suppressed as to be\r\n      nearly inaudible—if, indeed, the whole of this latter noise were\r\n      not rather produced by my own imagination. I say it seemed to\r\n      resemble sobbing or sighing—but, of course, it could not have\r\n      been either. I rather think it was a ringing in my own ears. Mr.\r\n      Wyatt, no doubt, according to custom, was merely giving the rein\r\n      to one of his hobbies—indulging in one of his fits of artistic\r\n      enthusiasm. He had opened his oblong box, in order to feast his\r\n      eyes on the pictorial treasure within. There was nothing in this,\r\n      however, to make him sob. I repeat, therefore, that it must have\r\n      been simply a freak of my own fancy, distempered by good Captain\r\n      Hardy’s green tea. Just before dawn, on each of the two nights of\r\n      which I speak, I distinctly heard Mr. Wyatt replace the lid upon\r\n      the oblong box, and force the nails into their old places by\r\n      means of the muffled mallet. Having done this, he issued from his\r\n      state-room, fully dressed, and proceeded to call Mrs. W. from\r\n      hers.\r\n\r\n      We had been at sea seven days, and were now off Cape Hatteras,\r\n      when there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest. We\r\n      were, in a measure, prepared for it, however, as the weather had\r\n      been holding out threats for some time. Every thing was made\r\n      snug, alow and aloft; and as the wind steadily freshened, we lay\r\n      to, at length, under spanker and foretopsail, both double-reefed.\r\n\r\n      In this trim we rode safely enough for forty-eight hours—the ship\r\n      proving herself an excellent sea-boat in many respects, and\r\n      shipping no water of any consequence. At the end of this period,\r\n      however, the gale had freshened into a hurricane, and our\r\n      after-sail split into ribbons, bringing us so much in the trough\r\n      of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas, one\r\n      immediately after the other. By this accident we lost three men\r\n      overboard with the caboose, and nearly the whole of the larboard\r\n      bulwarks. Scarcely had we recovered our senses, before the\r\n      foretopsail went into shreds, when we got up a storm stay-sail\r\n      and with this did pretty well for some hours, the ship heading\r\n      the sea much more steadily than before.\r\n\r\n      The gale still held on, however, and we saw no signs of its\r\n      abating. The rigging was found to be ill-fitted, and greatly\r\n      strained; and on the third day of the blow, about five in the\r\n      afternoon, our mizzen-mast, in a heavy lurch to windward, went by\r\n      the board. For an hour or more, we tried in vain to get rid of\r\n      it, on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship; and, before\r\n      we had succeeded, the carpenter came aft and announced four feet\r\n      of water in the hold. To add to our dilemma, we found the pumps\r\n      choked and nearly useless.\r\n\r\n      All was now confusion and despair—but an effort was made to\r\n      lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as\r\n      could be reached, and by cutting away the two masts that\r\n      remained. This we at last accomplished—but we were still unable\r\n      to do any thing at the pumps; and, in the meantime, the leak\r\n      gained on us very fast.\r\n\r\n      At sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and as\r\n      the sea went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of\r\n      saving ourselves in the boats. At eight P. M., the clouds broke\r\n      away to windward, and we had the advantage of a full moon—a piece\r\n      of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our drooping\r\n      spirits.\r\n\r\n      After incredible labor we succeeded, at length, in getting the\r\n      longboat over the side without material accident, and into this\r\n      we crowded the whole of the crew and most of the passengers. This\r\n      party made off immediately, and, after undergoing much suffering,\r\n      finally arrived, in safety, at Ocracoke Inlet, on the third day\r\n      after the wreck.\r\n\r\n      Fourteen passengers, with the captain, remained on board,\r\n      resolving to trust their fortunes to the jolly-boat at the stern.\r\n      We lowered it without difficulty, although it was only by a\r\n      miracle that we prevented it from swamping as it touched the\r\n      water. It contained, when afloat, the captain and his wife, Mr.\r\n      Wyatt and party, a Mexican officer, wife, four children, and\r\n      myself, with a negro valet.\r\n\r\n      We had no room, of course, for any thing except a few positively\r\n      necessary instruments, some provisions, and the clothes upon our\r\n      backs. No one had thought of even attempting to save any thing\r\n      more. What must have been the astonishment of all, then, when\r\n      having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship, Mr. Wyatt stood up\r\n      in the stern-sheets, and coolly demanded of Captain Hardy that\r\n      the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking in his\r\n      oblong box!\r\n\r\n      “Sit down, Mr. Wyatt,” replied the captain, somewhat sternly,\r\n      “you will capsize us if you do not sit quite still. Our gunwhale\r\n      is almost in the water now.”\r\n\r\n      “The box!” vociferated Mr. Wyatt, still standing—“the box, I say!\r\n      Captain Hardy, you cannot, you will not refuse me. Its weight\r\n      will be but a trifle—it is nothing—mere nothing. By the mother\r\n      who bore you—for the love of Heaven—by your hope of salvation, I\r\n      implore you to put back for the box!”\r\n\r\n      The captain, for a moment, seemed touched by the earnest appeal\r\n      of the artist, but he regained his stern composure, and merely\r\n      said:\r\n\r\n      “Mr. Wyatt, you are mad. I cannot listen to you. Sit down, I say,\r\n      or you will swamp the boat. Stay—hold him—seize him!—he is about\r\n      to spring overboard! There—I knew it—he is over!”\r\n\r\n      As the captain said this, Mr. Wyatt, in fact, sprang from the\r\n      boat, and, as we were yet in the lee of the wreck, succeeded, by\r\n      almost superhuman exertion, in getting hold of a rope which hung\r\n      from the fore-chains. In another moment he was on board, and\r\n      rushing frantically down into the cabin.\r\n\r\n      In the meantime, we had been swept astern of the ship, and being\r\n      quite out of her lee, were at the mercy of the tremendous sea\r\n      which was still running. We made a determined effort to put back,\r\n      but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the\r\n      tempest. We saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate\r\n      artist was sealed.\r\n\r\n      As our distance from the wreck rapidly increased, the madman (for\r\n      as such only could we regard him) was seen to emerge from the\r\n      companion—way, up which by dint of strength that appeared\r\n      gigantic, he dragged, bodily, the oblong box. While we gazed in\r\n      the extremity of astonishment, he passed, rapidly, several turns\r\n      of a three-inch rope, first around the box and then around his\r\n      body. In another instant both body and box were in the\r\n      sea—disappearing suddenly, at once and forever.\r\n\r\n      We lingered awhile sadly upon our oars, with our eyes riveted\r\n      upon the spot. At length we pulled away. The silence remained\r\n      unbroken for an hour. Finally, I hazarded a remark.\r\n\r\n      “Did you observe, captain, how suddenly they sank? Was not that\r\n      an exceedingly singular thing? I confess that I entertained some\r\n      feeble hope of his final deliverance, when I saw him lash himself\r\n      to the box, and commit himself to the sea.”\r\n\r\n      “They sank as a matter of course,” replied the captain, “and that\r\n      like a shot. They will soon rise again, however—but not till the\r\n      salt melts.”\r\n\r\n      “The salt!” I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n      “Hush!” said the captain, pointing to the wife and sisters of the\r\n      deceased. “We must talk of these things at some more appropriate\r\n      time.”\r\n\r\n      We suffered much, and made a narrow escape; but fortune\r\n      befriended us, as well as our mates in the long-boat. We landed,\r\n      in fine, more dead than alive, after four days of intense\r\n      distress, upon the beach opposite Roanoke Island. We remained\r\n      here a week, were not ill-treated by the wreckers, and at length\r\n      obtained a passage to New York.\r\n\r\n      About a month after the loss of the “Independence,” I happened to\r\n      meet Captain Hardy in Broadway. Our conversation turned,\r\n      naturally, upon the disaster, and especially upon the sad fate of\r\n      poor Wyatt. I thus learned the following particulars.\r\n\r\n      The artist had engaged passage for himself, wife, two sisters and\r\n      a servant. His wife was, indeed, as she had been represented, a\r\n      most lovely, and most accomplished woman. On the morning of the\r\n      fourteenth of June (the day in which I first visited the ship),\r\n      the lady suddenly sickened and died. The young husband was\r\n      frantic with grief—but circumstances imperatively forbade the\r\n      deferring his voyage to New York. It was necessary to take to her\r\n      mother the corpse of his adored wife, and, on the other hand, the\r\n      universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so openly was\r\n      well known. Nine-tenths of the passengers would have abandoned\r\n      the ship rather than take passage with a dead body.\r\n\r\n      In this dilemma, Captain Hardy arranged that the corpse, being\r\n      first partially embalmed, and packed, with a large quantity of\r\n      salt, in a box of suitable dimensions, should be conveyed on\r\n      board as merchandise. Nothing was to be said of the lady’s\r\n      decease; and, as it was well understood that Mr. Wyatt had\r\n      engaged passage for his wife, it became necessary that some\r\n      person should personate her during the voyage. This the deceased\r\n      lady’s-maid was easily prevailed on to do. The extra state-room,\r\n      originally engaged for this girl during her mistress’ life, was\r\n      now merely retained. In this state-room the pseudo-wife, slept,\r\n      of course, every night. In the daytime she performed, to the best\r\n      of her ability, the part of her mistress—whose person, it had\r\n      been carefully ascertained, was unknown to any of the passengers\r\n      on board.\r\n\r\n      My own mistake arose, naturally enough, through too careless, too\r\n      inquisitive, and too impulsive a temperament. But of late, it is\r\n      a rare thing that I sleep soundly at night. There is a\r\n      countenance which haunts me, turn as I will. There is an\r\n      hysterical laugh which will forever ring within my ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF BREATH\r\n\r\n\r\nO breathe not, etc.\r\n                    —Moore’s _Melodies_\r\n\r\n      The most notorious ill-fortune must in the end yield to the\r\n      untiring courage of philosophy—as the most stubborn city to the\r\n      ceaseless vigilance of an enemy. Shalmanezer, as we have it in\r\n      holy writings, lay three years before Samaria; yet it fell.\r\n      Sardanapalus—see Diodorus—maintained himself seven in Nineveh;\r\n      but to no purpose. Troy expired at the close of the second\r\n      lustrum; and Azoth, as Aristaeus declares upon his honour as a\r\n      gentleman, opened at last her gates to Psammetichus, after having\r\n      barred them for the fifth part of a century....\r\n\r\n      “Thou wretch!—thou vixen!—thou shrew!” said I to my wife on the\r\n      morning after our wedding; “thou witch!—thou hag!—thou\r\n      whippersnapper—thou sink of iniquity!—thou fiery-faced\r\n      quintessence of all that is abominable!—thou—thou—” here standing\r\n      upon tiptoe, seizing her by the throat, and placing my mouth\r\n      close to her ear, I was preparing to launch forth a new and more\r\n      decided epithet of opprobrium, which should not fail, if\r\n      ejaculated, to convince her of her insignificance, when to my\r\n      extreme horror and astonishment I discovered that I had lost my\r\n      breath.\r\n\r\n      The phrases “I am out of breath,” “I have lost my breath,” etc.,\r\n      are often enough repeated in common conversation; but it had\r\n      never occurred to me that the terrible accident of which I speak\r\n      could _bona fide_ and actually happen! Imagine—that is if you\r\n      have a fanciful turn—imagine, I say, my wonder—my\r\n      consternation—my despair!\r\n\r\n      There is a good genius, however, which has never entirely\r\n      deserted me. In my most ungovernable moods I still retain a sense\r\n      of propriety, _et le chemin des passions me conduit_—as Lord\r\n      Edouard in the “Julie” says it did him—_à la philosophie\r\n      véritable_.\r\n\r\n      Although I could not at first precisely ascertain to what degree\r\n      the occurrence had affected me, I determined at all events to\r\n      conceal the matter from my wife, until further experience should\r\n      discover to me the extent of this my unheard of calamity.\r\n      Altering my countenance, therefore, in a moment, from its\r\n      bepuffed and distorted appearance, to an expression of arch and\r\n      coquettish benignity, I gave my lady a pat on the one cheek, and\r\n      a kiss on the other, and without saying one syllable (Furies! I\r\n      could not), left her astonished at my drollery, as I pirouetted\r\n      out of the room in a _pas de zephyr_.\r\n\r\n      Behold me then safely ensconced in my private boudoir, a fearful\r\n      instance of the ill consequences attending upon\r\n      irascibility—alive, with the qualifications of the dead—dead,\r\n      with the propensities of the living—an anomaly on the face of the\r\n      earth—being very calm, yet breathless.\r\n\r\n      Yes! breathless. I am serious in asserting that my breath was\r\n      entirely gone. I could not have stirred with it a feather if my\r\n      life had been at issue, or sullied even the delicacy of a mirror.\r\n      Hard fate!—yet there was some alleviation to the first\r\n      overwhelming paroxysm of my sorrow. I found, upon trial, that the\r\n      powers of utterance which, upon my inability to proceed in the\r\n      conversation with my wife, I then concluded to be totally\r\n      destroyed, were in fact only partially impeded, and I discovered\r\n      that had I, at that interesting crisis, dropped my voice to a\r\n      singularly deep guttural, I might still have continued to her the\r\n      communication of my sentiments; this pitch of voice (the\r\n      guttural) depending, I find, not upon the current of the breath,\r\n      but upon a certain spasmodic action of the muscles of the throat.\r\n\r\n      Throwing myself upon a chair, I remained for some time absorbed\r\n      in meditation. My reflections, be sure, were of no consolatory\r\n      kind. A thousand vague and lachrymatory fancies took possession\r\n      of my soul—and even the idea of suicide flitted across my brain;\r\n      but it is a trait in the perversity of human nature to reject the\r\n      obvious and the ready, for the far-distant and equivocal. Thus I\r\n      shuddered at self-murder as the most decided of atrocities while\r\n      the tabby cat purred strenuously upon the rug, and the very\r\n      water-dog wheezed assiduously under the table, each taking to\r\n      itself much merit for the strength of its lungs, and all\r\n      obviously done in derision of my own pulmonary incapacity.\r\n\r\n      Oppressed with a tumult of vague hopes and fears, I at length\r\n      heard the footsteps of my wife descending the staircase. Being\r\n      now assured of her absence, I returned with a palpitating heart\r\n      to the scene of my disaster.\r\n\r\n      Carefully locking the door on the inside, I commenced a vigorous\r\n      search. It was possible, I thought, that, concealed in some\r\n      obscure corner, or lurking in some closet or drawer, might be\r\n      found the lost object of my inquiry. It might have a vapory—it\r\n      might even have a tangible form. Most philosophers, upon many\r\n      points of philosophy, are still very unphilosophical. William\r\n      Godwin, however, says in his “Mandeville,” that “invisible things\r\n      are the only realities,” and this, all will allow, is a case in\r\n      point. I would have the judicious reader pause before accusing\r\n      such asseverations of an undue quantum of absurdity. Anaxagoras,\r\n      it will be remembered, maintained that snow is black, and this I\r\n      have since found to be the case.\r\n\r\n      Long and earnestly did I continue the investigation: but the\r\n      contemptible reward of my industry and perseverance proved to be\r\n      only a set of false teeth, two pair of hips, an eye, and a bundle\r\n      of billets-doux from Mr. Windenough to my wife. I might as well\r\n      here observe that this confirmation of my lady’s partiality for\r\n      Mr. W. occasioned me little uneasiness. That Mrs. Lackobreath\r\n      should admire anything so dissimilar to myself was a natural and\r\n      necessary evil. I am, it is well known, of a robust and corpulent\r\n      appearance, and at the same time somewhat diminutive in stature.\r\n      What wonder, then, that the lath-like tenuity of my acquaintance,\r\n      and his altitude, which has grown into a proverb, should have met\r\n      with all due estimation in the eyes of Mrs. Lackobreath. But to\r\n      return.\r\n\r\n      My exertions, as I have before said, proved fruitless. Closet\r\n      after closet—drawer after drawer—corner after corner—were\r\n      scrutinized to no purpose. At one time, however, I thought myself\r\n      sure of my prize, having, in rummaging a dressing-case,\r\n      accidentally demolished a bottle of Grandjean’s Oil of\r\n      Archangels—which, as an agreeable perfume, I here take the\r\n      liberty of recommending.\r\n\r\n      With a heavy heart I returned to my boudoir—there to ponder upon\r\n      some method of eluding my wife’s penetration, until I could make\r\n      arrangements prior to my leaving the country, for to this I had\r\n      already made up my mind. In a foreign climate, being unknown, I\r\n      might, with some probability of success, endeavor to conceal my\r\n      unhappy calamity—a calamity calculated, even more than beggary,\r\n      to estrange the affections of the multitude, and to draw down\r\n      upon the wretch the well-merited indignation of the virtuous and\r\n      the happy. I was not long in hesitation. Being naturally quick, I\r\n      committed to memory the entire tragedy of “Metamora.” I had the\r\n      good fortune to recollect that in the accentuation of this drama,\r\n      or at least of such portion of it as is allotted to the hero, the\r\n      tones of voice in which I found myself deficient were altogether\r\n      unnecessary, and the deep guttural was expected to reign\r\n      monotonously throughout.\r\n\r\n      I practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented\r\n      marsh;—herein, however, having no reference to a similar\r\n      proceeding of Demosthenes, but from a design peculiarly and\r\n      conscientiously my own. Thus armed at all points, I determined to\r\n      make my wife believe that I was suddenly smitten with a passion\r\n      for the stage. In this, I succeeded to a miracle; and to every\r\n      question or suggestion found myself at liberty to reply in my\r\n      most frog-like and sepulchral tones with some passage from the\r\n      tragedy—any portion of which, as I soon took great pleasure in\r\n      observing, would apply equally well to any particular subject. It\r\n      is not to be supposed, however, that in the delivery of such\r\n      passages I was found at all deficient in the looking asquint—the\r\n      showing my teeth—the working my knees—the shuffling my feet—or in\r\n      any of those unmentionable graces which are now justly considered\r\n      the characteristics of a popular performer. To be sure they spoke\r\n      of confining me in a strait-jacket—but, good God! they never\r\n      suspected me of having lost my breath.\r\n\r\n      Having at length put my affairs in order, I took my seat very\r\n      early one morning in the mail stage for ——, giving it to be\r\n      understood, among my acquaintances, that business of the last\r\n      importance required my immediate personal attendance in that\r\n      city.\r\n\r\n      The coach was crammed to repletion; but in the uncertain twilight\r\n      the features of my companions could not be distinguished. Without\r\n      making any effectual resistance, I suffered myself to be placed\r\n      between two gentlemen of colossal dimensions; while a third, of a\r\n      size larger, requesting pardon for the liberty he was about to\r\n      take, threw himself upon my body at full length, and falling\r\n      asleep in an instant, drowned all my guttural ejaculations for\r\n      relief, in a snore which would have put to blush the roarings of\r\n      the bull of Phalaris. Happily the state of my respiratory\r\n      faculties rendered suffocation an accident entirely out of the\r\n      question.\r\n\r\n      As, however, the day broke more distinctly in our approach to the\r\n      outskirts of the city, my tormentor, arising and adjusting his\r\n      shirt-collar, thanked me in a very friendly manner for my\r\n      civility. Seeing that I remained motionless (all my limbs were\r\n      dislocated and my head twisted on one side), his apprehensions\r\n      began to be excited; and arousing the rest of the passengers, he\r\n      communicated, in a very decided manner, his opinion that a dead\r\n      man had been palmed upon them during the night for a living and\r\n      responsible fellow-traveller; here giving me a thump on the right\r\n      eye, by way of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion.\r\n\r\n      Hereupon all, one after another (there were nine in company),\r\n      believed it their duty to pull me by the ear. A young practising\r\n      physician, too, having applied a pocket-mirror to my mouth, and\r\n      found me without breath, the assertion of my persecutor was\r\n      pronounced a true bill; and the whole party expressed a\r\n      determination to endure tamely no such impositions for the\r\n      future, and to proceed no farther with any such carcasses for the\r\n      present.\r\n\r\n      I was here, accordingly, thrown out at the sign of the “Crow” (by\r\n      which tavern the coach happened to be passing), without meeting\r\n      with any farther accident than the breaking of both my arms,\r\n      under the left hind wheel of the vehicle. I must besides do the\r\n      driver the justice to state that he did not forget to throw after\r\n      me the largest of my trunks, which, unfortunately falling on my\r\n      head, fractured my skull in a manner at once interesting and\r\n      extraordinary.\r\n\r\n      The landlord of the “Crow,” who is a hospitable man, finding that\r\n      my trunk contained sufficient to indemnify him for any little\r\n      trouble he might take in my behalf, sent forthwith for a surgeon\r\n      of his acquaintance, and delivered me to his care with a bill and\r\n      receipt for ten dollars.\r\n\r\n      The purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced operations\r\n      immediately. Having cut off my ears, however, he discovered signs\r\n      of animation. He now rang the bell, and sent for a neighboring\r\n      apothecary with whom to consult in the emergency. In case of his\r\n      suspicions with regard to my existence proving ultimately\r\n      correct, he, in the meantime, made an incision in my stomach, and\r\n      removed several of my viscera for private dissection.\r\n\r\n      The apothecary had an idea that I was actually dead. This idea I\r\n      endeavored to confute, kicking and plunging with all my might,\r\n      and making the most furious contortions—for the operations of the\r\n      surgeon had, in a measure, restored me to the possession of my\r\n      faculties. All, however, was attributed to the effects of a new\r\n      galvanic battery, wherewith the apothecary, who is really a man\r\n      of information, performed several curious experiments, in which,\r\n      from my personal share in their fulfillment, I could not help\r\n      feeling deeply interested. It was a course of mortification to\r\n      me, nevertheless, that although I made several attempts at\r\n      conversation, my powers of speech were so entirely in abeyance,\r\n      that I could not even open my mouth; much less, then, make reply\r\n      to some ingenious but fanciful theories of which, under other\r\n      circumstances, my minute acquaintance with the Hippocratian\r\n      pathology would have afforded me a ready confutation.\r\n\r\n      Not being able to arrive at a conclusion, the practitioners\r\n      remanded me for farther examination. I was taken up into a\r\n      garret; and the surgeon’s lady having accommodated me with\r\n      drawers and stockings, the surgeon himself fastened my hands, and\r\n      tied up my jaws with a pocket-handkerchief—then bolted the door\r\n      on the outside as he hurried to his dinner, leaving me alone to\r\n      silence and to meditation.\r\n\r\n      I now discovered to my extreme delight that I could have spoken\r\n      had not my mouth been tied up with the pocket-handkerchief.\r\n      Consoling myself with this reflection, I was mentally repeating\r\n      some passages of the “Omnipresence of the Deity,” as is my custom\r\n      before resigning myself to sleep, when two cats, of a greedy and\r\n      vituperative turn, entering at a hole in the wall, leaped up with\r\n      a flourish a la Catalani, and alighting opposite one another on\r\n      my visage, betook themselves to indecorous contention for the\r\n      paltry consideration of my nose.\r\n\r\n      But, as the loss of his ears proved the means of elevating to the\r\n      throne of Cyrus, the Magian or Mige-Gush of Persia, and as the\r\n      cutting off his nose gave Zopyrus possession of Babylon, so the\r\n      loss of a few ounces of my countenance proved the salvation of my\r\n      body. Aroused by the pain, and burning with indignation, I burst,\r\n      at a single effort, the fastenings and the bandage. Stalking\r\n      across the room I cast a glance of contempt at the belligerents,\r\n      and throwing open the sash to their extreme horror and\r\n      disappointment, precipitated myself, very dexterously, from the\r\n      window.\r\n\r\n      The mail-robber W——, to whom I bore a singular resemblance, was\r\n      at this moment passing from the city jail to the scaffold erected\r\n      for his execution in the suburbs. His extreme infirmity and long\r\n      continued ill health had obtained him the privilege of remaining\r\n      unmanacled; and habited in his gallows costume—one very similar\r\n      to my own,—he lay at full length in the bottom of the hangman’s\r\n      cart (which happened to be under the windows of the surgeon at\r\n      the moment of my precipitation) without any other guard than the\r\n      driver, who was asleep, and two recruits of the sixth infantry,\r\n      who were drunk.\r\n\r\n      As ill-luck would have it, I alit upon my feet within the\r\n      vehicle. W——, who was an acute fellow, perceived his opportunity.\r\n      Leaping up immediately, he bolted out behind, and turning down an\r\n      alley, was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye. The recruits,\r\n      aroused by the bustle, could not exactly comprehend the merits of\r\n      the transaction. Seeing, however, a man, the precise counterpart\r\n      of the felon, standing upright in the cart before their eyes,\r\n      they were of the opinion that the rascal (meaning W——) was after\r\n      making his escape, (so they expressed themselves), and, having\r\n      communicated this opinion to one another, they took each a dram,\r\n      and then knocked me down with the butt-ends of their muskets.\r\n\r\n      It was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination. Of\r\n      course nothing could be said in my defence. Hanging was my\r\n      inevitable fate. I resigned myself thereto with a feeling half\r\n      stupid, half acrimonious. Being little of a cynic, I had all the\r\n      sentiments of a dog. The hangman, however, adjusted the noose\r\n      about my neck. The drop fell.\r\n\r\n      I forbear to depict my sensations upon the gallows; although\r\n      here, undoubtedly, I could speak to the point, and it is a topic\r\n      upon which nothing has been well said. In fact, to write upon\r\n      such a theme it is necessary to have been hanged. Every author\r\n      should confine himself to matters of experience. Thus Mark Antony\r\n      composed a treatise upon getting drunk.\r\n\r\n      I may just mention, however, that die I did not. My body was, but\r\n      I had no breath to be, suspended; and but for the knot under my\r\n      left ear (which had the feel of a military stock) I dare say that\r\n      I should have experienced very little inconvenience. As for the\r\n      jerk given to my neck upon the falling of the drop, it merely\r\n      proved a corrective to the twist afforded me by the fat gentleman\r\n      in the coach.\r\n\r\n      For good reasons, however, I did my best to give the crowd the\r\n      worth of their trouble. My convulsions were said to be\r\n      extraordinary. My spasms it would have been difficult to beat.\r\n      The populace encored. Several gentlemen swooned; and a multitude\r\n      of ladies were carried home in hysterics. Pinxit availed himself\r\n      of the opportunity to retouch, from a sketch taken upon the spot,\r\n      his admirable painting of the “Marsyas flayed alive.”\r\n\r\n      When I had afforded sufficient amusement, it was thought proper\r\n      to remove my body from the gallows;—this the more especially as\r\n      the real culprit had in the meantime been retaken and recognized,\r\n      a fact which I was so unlucky as not to know.\r\n\r\n      Much sympathy was, of course, exercised in my behalf, and as no\r\n      one made claim to my corpse, it was ordered that I should be\r\n      interred in a public vault.\r\n\r\n      Here, after due interval, I was deposited. The sexton departed,\r\n      and I was left alone. A line of Marston’s “Malcontent”—\r\n\r\n      Death’s a good fellow and keeps open house—\r\n\r\n      struck me at that moment as a palpable lie.\r\n\r\n      I knocked off, however, the lid of my coffin, and stepped out.\r\n      The place was dreadfully dreary and damp, and I became troubled\r\n      with ennui. By way of amusement, I felt my way among the numerous\r\n      coffins ranged in order around. I lifted them down, one by one,\r\n      and breaking open their lids, busied myself in speculations about\r\n      the mortality within.\r\n\r\n      “This,” I soliloquized, tumbling over a carcass, puffy, bloated,\r\n      and rotund—“this has been, no doubt, in every sense of the word,\r\n      an unhappy—an unfortunate man. It has been his terrible lot not\r\n      to walk but to waddle—to pass through life not like a human\r\n      being, but like an elephant—not like a man, but like a\r\n      rhinoceros.\r\n\r\n      “His attempts at getting on have been mere abortions, and his\r\n      circumgyratory proceedings a palpable failure. Taking a step\r\n      forward, it has been his misfortune to take two toward the right,\r\n      and three toward the left. His studies have been confined to the\r\n      poetry of Crabbe. He can have no idea of the wonder of a\r\n      pirouette. To him a pas de papillon has been an abstract\r\n      conception. He has never ascended the summit of a hill. He has\r\n      never viewed from any steeple the glories of a metropolis. Heat\r\n      has been his mortal enemy. In the dog-days his days have been the\r\n      days of a dog. Therein, he has dreamed of flames and\r\n      suffocation—of mountains upon mountains—of Pelion upon Ossa. He\r\n      was short of breath—to say all in a word, he was short of breath.\r\n      He thought it extravagant to play upon wind instruments. He was\r\n      the inventor of self-moving fans, wind-sails, and ventilators. He\r\n      patronized Du Pont the bellows-maker, and he died miserably in\r\n      attempting to smoke a cigar. His was a case in which I feel a\r\n      deep interest—a lot in which I sincerely sympathize.\r\n\r\n      “But here,”—said I—“here”—and I dragged spitefully from its\r\n      receptacle a gaunt, tall and peculiar-looking form, whose\r\n      remarkable appearance struck me with a sense of unwelcome\r\n      familiarity—“here is a wretch entitled to no earthly\r\n      commiseration.” Thus saying, in order to obtain a more distinct\r\n      view of my subject, I applied my thumb and forefinger to its\r\n      nose, and causing it to assume a sitting position upon the\r\n      ground, held it thus, at the length of my arm, while I continued\r\n      my soliloquy.\r\n\r\n      “Entitled,” I repeated, “to no earthly commiseration. Who indeed\r\n      would think of compassioning a shadow? Besides, has he not had\r\n      his full share of the blessings of mortality? He was the\r\n      originator of tall monuments—shot-towers—lightning-rods—Lombardy\r\n      poplars. His treatise upon “Shades and Shadows” has immortalized\r\n      him. He edited with distinguished ability the last edition of\r\n      “South on the Bones.” He went early to college and studied\r\n      pneumatics. He then came home, talked eternally, and played upon\r\n      the French-horn. He patronized the bagpipes. Captain Barclay, who\r\n      walked against Time, would not walk against him. Windham and\r\n      Allbreath were his favorite writers,—his favorite artist, Phiz.\r\n      He died gloriously while inhaling gas—levique flatu corrupitur,\r\n      like the fama pudicitae in Hieronymus. {*1} He was indubitably\r\n      a—”\r\n\r\n“How can you?—how—can—you?”—interrupted the object of my\r\nanimadversions, gasping for breath, and tearing off, with a desperate\r\nexertion, the bandage around its jaws—“how can you, Mr. Lackobreath, be\r\nso infernally cruel as to pinch me in that manner by the nose? Did you\r\nnot see how they had fastened up my mouth—and you must know—if you know\r\nany thing—how vast a superfluity of breath I have to dispose of! If you\r\ndo not know, however, sit down and you shall see. In my situation it is\r\nreally a great relief to be able to open ones mouth—to be able to\r\nexpatiate—to be able to communicate with a person like yourself, who do\r\nnot think yourself called upon at every period to interrupt the thread\r\nof a gentleman’s discourse. Interruptions are annoying and should\r\nundoubtedly be abolished—don’t you think so?—no reply, I beg you,—one\r\nperson is enough to be speaking at a time.—I shall be done by and by,\r\nand then you may begin.—How the devil sir, did you get into this\r\nplace?—not a word I beseech you—been here some time myself—terrible\r\naccident!—heard of it, I suppose?—awful calamity!—walking under your\r\nwindows—some short while ago—about the time you were\r\nstage-struck—horrible occurrence!—heard of “catching one’s breath,”\r\neh?—hold your tongue I tell you!—I caught somebody else’s!—had always\r\ntoo much of my own—met Blab at the corner of the street—wouldn’t give\r\nme a chance for a word—couldn’t get in a syllable edgeways—attacked,\r\nconsequently, with epilepsis—Blab made his escape—damn all fools!—they\r\ntook me up for dead, and put me in this place—pretty doings all of\r\nthem!—heard all you said about me—every word a\r\nlie—horrible!—wonderful!—outrageous!—hideous!—incomprehensible!—et\r\ncetera—et cetera—et cetera—et cetera—”\r\n\r\n      It is impossible to conceive my astonishment at so unexpected a\r\n      discourse, or the joy with which I became gradually convinced\r\n      that the breath so fortunately caught by the gentleman (whom I\r\n      soon recognized as my neighbor Windenough) was, in fact, the\r\n      identical expiration mislaid by myself in the conversation with\r\n      my wife. Time, place, and circumstances rendered it a matter\r\n      beyond question. I did not, however, immediately release my hold\r\n      upon Mr. W.’s proboscis—not at least during the long period in\r\n      which the inventor of Lombardy poplars continued to favor me with\r\n      his explanations.\r\n\r\n      In this respect I was actuated by that habitual prudence which\r\n      has ever been my predominating trait. I reflected that many\r\n      difficulties might still lie in the path of my preservation which\r\n      only extreme exertion on my part would be able to surmount. Many\r\n      persons, I considered, are prone to estimate commodities in their\r\n      possession—however valueless to the then proprietor—however\r\n      troublesome, or distressing—in direct ratio with the advantages\r\n      to be derived by others from their attainment, or by themselves\r\n      from their abandonment. Might not this be the case with Mr.\r\n      Windenough? In displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was\r\n      at present so willing to get rid, might I not lay myself open to\r\n      the exactions of his avarice? There are scoundrels in this world,\r\n      I remembered with a sigh, who will not scruple to take unfair\r\n      opportunities with even a next door neighbor, and (this remark is\r\n      from Epictetus) it is precisely at that time when men are most\r\n      anxious to throw off the burden of their own calamities that they\r\n      feel the least desirous of relieving them in others.\r\n\r\n      Upon considerations similar to these, and still retaining my\r\n      grasp upon the nose of Mr. W., I accordingly thought proper to\r\n      model my reply.\r\n\r\n      “Monster!” I began in a tone of the deepest indignation—“monster\r\n      and double-winded idiot!—dost thou, whom for thine iniquities it\r\n      has pleased heaven to accurse with a two-fold respimtion—dost\r\n      thou, I say, presume to address me in the familiar language of an\r\n      old acquaintance?—‘I lie,’ forsooth! and ‘hold my tongue,’ to be\r\n      sure!—pretty conversation indeed, to a gentleman with a single\r\n      breath!—all this, too, when I have it in my power to relieve the\r\n      calamity under which thou dost so justly suffer—to curtail the\r\n      superfluities of thine unhappy respiration.”\r\n\r\n      Like Brutus, I paused for a reply—with which, like a tornado, Mr.\r\n      Windenough immediately overwhelmed me. Protestation followed upon\r\n      protestation, and apology upon apology. There were no terms with\r\n      which he was unwilling to comply, and there were none of which I\r\n      failed to take the fullest advantage.\r\n\r\n      Preliminaries being at length arranged, my acquaintance delivered\r\n      me the respiration; for which (having carefully examined it) I\r\n      gave him afterward a receipt.\r\n\r\n      I am aware that by many I shall be held to blame for speaking in\r\n      a manner so cursory, of a transaction so impalpable. It will be\r\n      thought that I should have entered more minutely, into the\r\n      details of an occurrence by which—and this is very true—much new\r\n      light might be thrown upon a highly interesting branch of\r\n      physical philosophy.\r\n\r\n      To all this I am sorry that I cannot reply. A hint is the only\r\n      answer which I am permitted to make. There were circumstances—but\r\n      I think it much safer upon consideration to say as little as\r\n      possible about an affair so delicate—so delicate, I repeat, and\r\n      at the time involving the interests of a third party whose\r\n      sulphurous resentment I have not the least desire, at this\r\n      moment, of incurring.\r\n\r\n      We were not long after this necessary arrangement in effecting an\r\n      escape from the dungeons of the sepulchre. The united strength of\r\n      our resuscitated voices was soon sufficiently apparent. Scissors,\r\n      the Whig editor, republished a treatise upon “the nature and\r\n      origin of subterranean noises.” A reply—rejoinder—confutation—and\r\n      justification—followed in the columns of a Democratic gazette. It\r\n      was not until the opening of the vault to decide the controversy,\r\n      that the appearance of Mr. Windenough and myself proved both\r\n      parties to have been decidedly in the wrong.\r\n\r\n      I cannot conclude these details of some very singular passages in\r\n      a life at all times sufficiently eventful, without again\r\n      recalling to the attention of the reader the merits of that\r\n      indiscriminate philosophy which is a sure and ready shield\r\n      against those shafts of calamity which can neither be seen, felt\r\n      nor fully understood. It was in the spirit of this wisdom that,\r\n      among the ancient Hebrews, it was believed the gates of Heaven\r\n      would be inevitably opened to that sinner, or saint, who, with\r\n      good lungs and implicit confidence, should vociferate the word\r\n      “Amen!” It was in the spirit of this wisdom that, when a great\r\n      plague raged at Athens, and every means had been in vain\r\n      attempted for its removal, Epimenides, as Laërtius relates, in\r\n      his second book, of that philosopher, advised the erection of a\r\n      shrine and temple “to the proper God.”\r\n\r\n      LYTTLETON BARRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN THAT WAS USED UP\r\n\r\nA TALE OF THE LATE BUGABOO AND KICKAPOO CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Pleurez, pleurez, mes yeux, et fondez vous en eau!_\r\n     _La moitié de ma vie a mis l’ autre au tombeau._\r\n                    —CORNEILLE.\r\n\r\n      I cannot just now remember when or where I first made the\r\n      acquaintance of that truly fine-looking fellow, Brevet Brigadier\r\n      General John A. B. C. Smith. Some one _did_ introduce me to the\r\n      gentleman, I am sure—at some public meeting, I know very\r\n      well—held about something of great importance, no doubt—at some\r\n      place or other, I feel convinced,—whose name I have unaccountably\r\n      forgotten. The truth is—that the introduction was attended, upon\r\n      my part, with a degree of anxious embarrassment which operated to\r\n      prevent any definite impressions of either time or place. I am\r\n      constitutionally nervous—this, with me, is a family failing, and\r\n      I can’t help it. In especial, the slightest appearance of\r\n      mystery—of any point I cannot exactly comprehend—puts me at once\r\n      into a pitiable state of agitation.\r\n\r\n      There was something, as it were, remarkable—yes, _remarkable_,\r\n      although this is but a feeble term to express my full\r\n      meaning—about the entire individuality of the personage in\r\n      question. He was, perhaps, six feet in height, and of a presence\r\n      singularly commanding. There was an _air distingué_ pervading the\r\n      whole man, which spoke of high breeding, and hinted at high\r\n      birth. Upon this topic—the topic of Smith’s personal appearance—I\r\n      have a kind of melancholy satisfaction in being minute. His head\r\n      of hair would have done honor to a Brutus; nothing could be more\r\n      richly flowing, or possess a brighter gloss. It was of a jetty\r\n      black;—which was also the color, or more properly the no color of\r\n      his unimaginable whiskers. You perceive I cannot speak of these\r\n      latter without enthusiasm; it is not too much to say that they\r\n      were the handsomest pair of whiskers under the sun. At all\r\n      events, they encircled, and at times partially overshadowed, a\r\n      mouth utterly unequalled. Here were the most entirely even, and\r\n      the most brilliantly white of all conceivable teeth. From between\r\n      them, upon every proper occasion, issued a voice of surpassing\r\n      clearness, melody, and strength. In the matter of eyes, also, my\r\n      acquaintance was pre-eminently endowed. Either one of such a pair\r\n      was worth a couple of the ordinary ocular organs. They were of a\r\n      deep hazel, exceedingly large and lustrous; and there was\r\n      perceptible about them, ever and anon, just that amount of\r\n      interesting obliquity which gives pregnancy to expression.\r\n\r\n      The bust of the General was unquestionably the finest bust I ever\r\n      saw. For your life you could not have found a fault with its\r\n      wonderful proportion. This rare peculiarity set off to great\r\n      advantage a pair of shoulders which would have called up a blush\r\n      of conscious inferiority into the countenance of the marble\r\n      Apollo. I have a passion for fine shoulders, and may say that I\r\n      never beheld them in perfection before. The arms altogether were\r\n      admirably modelled. Nor were the lower limbs less superb. These\r\n      were, indeed, the _ne plus ultra_ of good legs. Every connoisseur\r\n      in such matters admitted the legs to be good. There was neither\r\n      too much flesh, nor too little,—neither rudeness nor fragility. I\r\n      could not imagine a more graceful curve than that of the _os\r\n      femoris_, and there was just that due gentle prominence in the\r\n      rear of the _fibula_ which goes to the conformation of a properly\r\n      proportioned calf. I wish to God my young and talented friend\r\n      Chiponchipino, the sculptor, had but seen the legs of Brevet\r\n      Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith.\r\n\r\n      But although men so absolutely fine-looking are neither as plenty\r\n      as reasons or blackberries, still I could not bring myself to\r\n      believe that _the remarkable_ something to which I alluded just\r\n      now,—that the odd air of _je ne sais quoi_ which hung about my\r\n      new acquaintance,—lay altogether, or indeed at all, in the\r\n      supreme excellence of his bodily endowments. Perhaps it might be\r\n      traced to the _manner_;—yet here again I could not pretend to be\r\n      positive. There _was_ a primness, not to say stiffness, in his\r\n      carriage—a degree of measured, and, if I may so express it, of\r\n      rectangular precision, attending his every movement, which,\r\n      observed in a more diminutive figure, would have had the least\r\n      little savor in the world, of affectation, pomposity or\r\n      constraint, but which noticed in a gentleman of his undoubted\r\n      dimensions, was readily placed to the account of reserve,\r\n      _hauteur_—of a commendable sense, in short, of what is due to the\r\n      dignity of colossal proportion.\r\n\r\n      The kind friend who presented me to General Smith whispered in my\r\n      ear some few words of comment upon the man. He was a _remarkable_\r\n      man—a _very_ remarkable man—indeed one of the _most_ remarkable\r\n      men of the age. He was an especial favorite, too, with the\r\n      ladies—chiefly on account of his high reputation for courage.\r\n\r\n      “In _that_ point he is unrivalled—indeed he is a perfect\r\n      desperado—a down-right fire-eater, and no mistake,” said my\r\n      friend, here dropping his voice excessively low, and thrilling me\r\n      with the mystery of his tone.\r\n\r\n      “A downright fire-eater, and _no_ mistake. Showed _that_, I\r\n      should say, to some purpose, in the late tremendous swamp-fight\r\n      away down South, with the Bugaboo and Kickapoo Indians.” [Here my\r\n      friend opened his eyes to some extent.] “Bless my soul!—blood and\r\n      thunder, and all that!—_prodigies_ of valor!—heard of him of\r\n      course?—you know he’s the man—”\r\n\r\n      “Man alive, how _do_ you do? why, how _are_ ye? _very_ glad to\r\n      see ye, indeed!” here interrupted the General himself, seizing my\r\n      companion by the hand as he drew near, and bowing stiffly, but\r\n      profoundly, as I was presented. I then thought, (and I think so\r\n      still,) that I never heard a clearer nor a stronger voice, nor\r\n      beheld a finer set of teeth: but I _must_ say that I was sorry\r\n      for the interruption just at that moment, as, owing to the\r\n      whispers and insinuations aforesaid, my interest had been greatly\r\n      excited in the hero of the Bugaboo and Kickapoo campaign.\r\n\r\n      However, the delightfully luminous conversation of Brevet\r\n      Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith soon completely dissipated\r\n      this chagrin. My friend leaving us immediately, we had quite a\r\n      long _tête-à-tête_, and I was not only pleased but\r\n      _really_—instructed. I never heard a more fluent talker, or a man\r\n      of greater general information. With becoming modesty, he\r\n      forebore, nevertheless, to touch upon the theme I had just then\r\n      most at heart—I mean the mysterious circumstances attending the\r\n      Bugaboo war—and, on my own part, what I conceive to be a proper\r\n      sense of delicacy forbade me to broach the subject; although, in\r\n      truth, I was exceedingly tempted to do so. I perceived, too, that\r\n      the gallant soldier preferred topics of philosophical interest,\r\n      and that he delighted, especially, in commenting upon the rapid\r\n      march of mechanical invention. Indeed, lead him where I would,\r\n      this was a point to which he invariably came back.\r\n\r\n      “There is nothing at all like it,” he would say; “we are a\r\n      wonderful people, and live in a wonderful age. Parachutes and\r\n      rail-roads—man-traps and spring-guns! Our steam-boats are upon\r\n      every sea, and the Nassau balloon packet is about to run regular\r\n      trips (fare either way only twenty pounds sterling) between\r\n      London and Timbuctoo. And who shall calculate the immense\r\n      influence upon social life—upon arts—upon commerce—upon\r\n      literature—which will be the immediate result of the great\r\n      principles of electro-magnetics! Nor, is this all, let me assure\r\n      you! There is really no end to the march of invention. The most\r\n      wonderful—the most ingenious—and let me add, Mr.—Mr.—Thompson, I\r\n      believe, is your name—let me add, I say, the most _useful_—the\r\n      most truly _useful_—mechanical contrivances, are daily springing\r\n      up like mushrooms, if I may so express myself, or, more\r\n      figuratively, like—ah—grasshoppers—like grasshoppers, Mr.\r\n      Thompson—about us and ah—ah—ah—around us!”\r\n\r\n      Thompson, to be sure, is not my name; but it is needless to say\r\n      that I left General Smith with a heightened interest in the man,\r\n      with an exalted opinion of his conversational powers, and a deep\r\n      sense of the valuable privileges we enjoy in living in this age\r\n      of mechanical invention. My curiosity, however, had not been\r\n      altogether satisfied, and I resolved to prosecute immediate\r\n      inquiry among my acquaintances touching the Brevet Brigadier\r\n      General himself, and particularly respecting the tremendous\r\n      events _quorum pars magna fuit_, during the Bugaboo and Kickapoo\r\n      campaign.\r\n\r\n      The first opportunity which presented itself, and which\r\n      (_horresco referens_) I did not in the least scruple to seize,\r\n      occurred at the Church of the Reverend Doctor Drummummupp, where\r\n      I found myself established, one Sunday, just at sermon time, not\r\n      only in the pew, but by the side, of that worthy and\r\n      communicative little friend of mine, Miss Tabitha T. Thus seated,\r\n      I congratulated myself, and with much reason, upon the very\r\n      flattering state of affairs. If any person knew anything about\r\n      Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith, that person, it was\r\n      clear to me, was Miss Tabitha T. We telegraphed a few signals,\r\n      and then commenced, _sotto voce_, a brisk _tête-à-tête_.\r\n\r\n      “Smith!” said she, in reply to my very earnest inquiry;\r\n      “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.? Bless me, I thought you\r\n      _knew_ all about _him!_ This is a wonderfully inventive age!\r\n      Horrid affair that!—a bloody set of wretches, those\r\n      Kickapoos!—fought like a hero—prodigies of valor—immortal renown.\r\n      Smith!—Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C.! why, you know he’s\r\n      the man—”\r\n\r\n      “Man,” here broke in Doctor Drummummupp, at the top of his voice,\r\n      and with a thump that came near knocking the pulpit about our\r\n      ears—“man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live;\r\n      he cometh up and is cut down like a flower!” I started to the\r\n      extremity of the pew, and perceived by the animated looks of the\r\n      divine, that the wrath which had nearly proved fatal to the\r\n      pulpit had been excited by the whispers of the lady and myself.\r\n      There was no help for it; so I submitted with a good grace, and\r\n      listened, in all the martyrdom of dignified silence, to the\r\n      balance of that very capital discourse.\r\n\r\n      Next evening found me a somewhat late visitor at the Rantipole\r\n      Theatre, where I felt sure of satisfying my curiosity at once, by\r\n      merely stepping into the box of those exquisite specimens of\r\n      affability and omniscience, the Misses Arabella and Miranda\r\n      Cognoscenti. That fine tragedian, Climax, was doing Iago to a\r\n      very crowded house, and I experienced some little difficulty in\r\n      making my wishes understood; especially, as our box was next the\r\n      slips, and completely overlooked the stage.\r\n\r\n      “Smith!” said Miss Arabella, as she at length comprehended the\r\n      purport of my query; “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.?”\r\n\r\n      “Smith!” inquired Miranda, musingly. “God bless me, did you ever\r\n      behold a finer figure?”\r\n\r\n      “Never, madam, but _do_ tell me—”\r\n\r\n      “Or so inimitable grace?”\r\n\r\n      “Never, upon my word!—But pray inform me—”\r\n\r\n      “Or so just an appreciation of stage effect?”\r\n\r\n      “Madam!”\r\n\r\n      “Or a more delicate sense of the true beauties of Shakespeare? Be\r\n      so good as to look at that leg!”\r\n\r\n      “The devil!” and I turned again to her sister.\r\n\r\n      “Smith!” said she, “why, not General John A. B. C.? Horrid affair\r\n      that, wasn’t it?—great wretches, those Bugaboos—savage and so\r\n      on—but we live in a wonderfully inventive age!—Smith!—O yes!\r\n      great man!—perfect desperado!—immortal renown!—prodigies of\r\n      valor! _Never heard!_” [This was given in a scream.] “Bless my\r\n      soul! why, he’s the man—”\r\n\r\n                         “——mandragora\r\n     Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world\r\n     Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\r\n     Which thou owd’st yesterday!”\r\n\r\n      here roared our Climax just in my ear, and shaking his fist in my\r\n      face all the time, in a way that I _couldn’t_ stand, and I\r\n      _wouldn’t_. I left the Misses Cognoscenti immediately, went\r\n      behind the scenes forthwith, and gave the beggarly scoundrel such\r\n      a thrashing as I trust he will remember to the day of his death.\r\n\r\n      At the _soirée_ of the lovely widow, Mrs. Kathleen O’Trump, I was\r\n      confident that I should meet with no similar disappointment.\r\n      Accordingly, I was no sooner seated at the card-table, with my\r\n      pretty hostess for a _vis-à-vis_, than I propounded those\r\n      questions the solution of which had become a matter so essential\r\n      to my peace.\r\n\r\n      “Smith!” said my partner, “why, not General John A. B. C.? Horrid\r\n      affair that, wasn’t it?—diamonds, did you say?—terrible wretches\r\n      those Kickapoos!—we are playing _whist_, if you please, Mr.\r\n      Tattle—however, this is the age of invention, most certainly\r\n      _the_ age, one may say—_the_ age _par excellence_—speak\r\n      French?—oh, quite a hero—perfect desperado!—_no hearts_, Mr.\r\n      Tattle? I don’t believe it.—immortal renown and all\r\n      that!—prodigies of valor! _Never heard!!_—why, bless me, he’s the\r\n      man—”\r\n\r\n      “Mann!—_Captain_ Mann?” here screamed some little feminine\r\n      interloper from the farthest corner of the room. “Are you talking\r\n      about Captain Mann and the duel?—oh, I _must_ hear—do tell—go on,\r\n      Mrs. O’Trump!—do now go on!” And go on Mrs. O’Trump did—all about\r\n      a certain Captain Mann, who was either shot or hung, or should\r\n      have been both shot and hung. Yes! Mrs. O’Trump, she went on, and\r\n      I—I went off. There was no chance of hearing anything farther\r\n      that evening in regard to Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C.\r\n      Smith.\r\n\r\n      Still I consoled myself with the reflection that the tide of ill\r\n      luck would not run against me forever, and so determined to make\r\n      a bold push for information at the rout of that bewitching little\r\n      angel, the graceful Mrs. Pirouette.\r\n\r\n      “Smith!” said Mrs. P., as we twirled about together in a _pas de\r\n      zephyr_, “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.? Dreadful\r\n      business that of the Bugaboos, wasn’t it?—dreadful creatures,\r\n      those Indians!—_do_ turn out your toes! I really am ashamed of\r\n      you—man of great courage, poor fellow!—but this is a wonderful\r\n      age for invention—O dear me, I’m out of breath—quite a\r\n      desperado—prodigies of valor—_never heard!_—can’t believe it—I\r\n      shall have to sit down and enlighten you—Smith! why, he’s the\r\n      man—”\r\n\r\n      “Man-_Fred_, I tell you!” here bawled out Miss Bas-Bleu, as I led\r\n      Mrs. Pirouette to a seat. “Did ever anybody hear the like? It’s\r\n      Man-_Fred_, I say, and not at all by any means Man-_Friday_.”\r\n      Here Miss Bas-Bleu beckoned to me in a very peremptory manner;\r\n      and I was obliged, will I nill I, to leave Mrs. P. for the\r\n      purpose of deciding a dispute touching the title of a certain\r\n      poetical drama of Lord Byron’s. Although I pronounced, with great\r\n      promptness, that the true title was Man-_Friday_, and not by any\r\n      means Man-_Fred_, yet when I returned to seek Mrs. Pirouette she\r\n      was not to be discovered, and I made my retreat from the house in\r\n      a very bitter spirit of animosity against the whole race of the\r\n      Bas-Bleus.\r\n\r\n      Matters had now assumed a really serious aspect, and I resolved\r\n      to call at once upon my particular friend, Mr. Theodore Sinivate;\r\n      for I knew that here at least I should get something like\r\n      definite information.\r\n\r\n      “Smith!” said he, in his well-known peculiar way of drawling out\r\n      his syllables; “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.? Savage\r\n      affair that with the Kickapo-o-o-os, wasn’t it? Say! don’t you\r\n      think so?—perfect despera-a-ado—great pity, ‘pon my\r\n      honor!—wonderfully inventive age!—pro-o-odigies of valor! By the\r\n      by, did you ever hear about Captain Ma-a-a-a-n?”\r\n\r\n      “Captain Mann be d—d!” said I; “please to go on with your story.”\r\n\r\n      “Hem!—oh well!—quite _la même cho-o-ose_, as we say in France.\r\n      Smith, eh? Brigadier-General John A.—B.—C.? I say”—[here Mr. S.\r\n      thought proper to put his finger to the side of his nose]—“I say,\r\n      you don’t mean to insinuate now, really and truly, and\r\n      conscientiously, that you don’t know all about that affair of\r\n      Smith’s, as well as I do, eh? Smith? John A—B—C.? Why, bless me,\r\n      he’s the ma-a-an—”\r\n\r\n      “_Mr_. Sinivate,” said I, imploringly, “_is_ he the man in the\r\n      mask?”\r\n\r\n      “No-o-o!” said he, looking wise, “nor the man in the mo-o-on.”\r\n\r\n      This reply I considered a pointed and positive insult, and so\r\n      left the house at once in high dudgeon, with a firm resolve to\r\n      call my friend, Mr. Sinivate, to a speedy account for his\r\n      ungentlemanly conduct and ill-breeding.\r\n\r\n      In the meantime, however, I had no notion of being thwarted\r\n      touching the information I desired. There was one resource left\r\n      me yet. I would go to the fountain-head. I would call forthwith\r\n      upon the General himself, and demand, in explicit terms, a\r\n      solution of this abominable piece of mystery. Here, at least,\r\n      there should be no chance for equivocation. I would be plain,\r\n      positive, peremptory—as short as pie-crust—as concise as Tacitus\r\n      or Montesquieu.\r\n\r\n      It was early when I called, and the General was dressing; but I\r\n      pleaded urgent business, and was shown at once into his bed-room\r\n      by an old negro valet, who remained in attendance during my\r\n      visit. As I entered the chamber, I looked about, of course, for\r\n      the occupant, but did not immediately perceive him. There was a\r\n      large and exceedingly odd-looking bundle of something which lay\r\n      close by my feet on the floor, and, as I was not in the best\r\n      humor in the world, I gave it a kick out of the way.\r\n\r\n      “Hem! ahem! rather civil that, I should say!” said the bundle, in\r\n      one of the smallest, and altogether the funniest little voices,\r\n      between a squeak and a whistle, that I ever heard in all the days\r\n      of my existence.\r\n\r\n      “Ahem! rather civil that, I should observe.”\r\n\r\n      I fairly shouted with terror, and made off, at a tangent, into\r\n      the farthest extremity of the room.\r\n\r\n      “God bless me! my dear fellow,” here again whistled the bundle,\r\n      “what—what—what—why, what _is_ the matter? I really believe you\r\n      don’t know me at all.”\r\n\r\n      What _could_ I say to all this—what _could_ I? I staggered into\r\n      an arm-chair, and, with staring eyes and open mouth, awaited the\r\n      solution of the wonder.\r\n\r\n      “Strange you shouldn’t know me though, isn’t it?” presently\r\n      re-squeaked the nondescript, which I now perceived was\r\n      performing, upon the floor, some inexplicable evolution, very\r\n      analogous to the drawing on of a stocking. There was only a\r\n      single leg, however, apparent.\r\n\r\n      “Strange you shouldn’t know me, though, isn’t it? Pompey, bring\r\n      me that leg!” Here Pompey handed the bundle, a very capital cork\r\n      leg, already dressed, which it screwed on in a trice; and then it\r\n      stood up before my eyes.\r\n\r\n      “And a bloody action it _was_,” continued the thing, as if in a\r\n      soliloquy; “but then one mustn’t fight with the Bugaboos and\r\n      Kickapoos, and think of coming off with a mere scratch. Pompey,\r\n      I’ll thank you now for that arm. Thomas” [turning to me] “is\r\n      decidedly the best hand at a cork leg; but if you should ever\r\n      want an arm, my dear fellow, you must really let me recommend you\r\n      to Bishop.” Here Pompey screwed on an arm.\r\n\r\n      “We had rather hot work of it, that you may say. Now, you dog,\r\n      slip on my shoulders and bosom! Pettitt makes the best shoulders,\r\n      but for a bosom you will have to go to Ducrow.”\r\n\r\n      “Bosom!” said I.\r\n\r\n      “Pompey, will you _never_ be ready with that wig? Scalping is a\r\n      rough process after all; but then you can procure such a capital\r\n      scratch at De L’Orme’s.”\r\n\r\n      “Scratch!”\r\n\r\n      “Now, you nigger, my teeth! For a _good_ set of these you had\r\n      better go to Parmly’s at once; high prices, but excellent work. I\r\n      swallowed some very capital articles, though, when the big\r\n      Bugaboo rammed me down with the butt end of his rifle.”\r\n\r\n      “Butt end! ram down!! my eye!!”\r\n\r\n      “O yes, by-the-by, my eye—here, Pompey, you scamp, screw it in !\r\n      Those Kickapoos are not so very slow at a gouge; but he’s a\r\n      belied man, that Dr. Williams, after all; you can’t imagine how\r\n      well I see with the eyes of his make.”\r\n\r\n      I now began very clearly to perceive that the object before me\r\n      was nothing more nor less than my new acquaintance, Brevet\r\n      Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith. The manipulations of\r\n      Pompey had made, I must confess, a very striking difference in\r\n      the appearance of the personal man. The voice, however, still\r\n      puzzled me no little; but even this apparent mystery was speedily\r\n      cleared up.\r\n\r\n      “Pompey, you black rascal,” squeaked the General, “I really do\r\n      believe you would let me go out without my palate.”\r\n\r\n      Hereupon, the negro, grumbling out an apology, went up to his\r\n      master, opened his mouth with the knowing air of a horse-jockey,\r\n      and adjusted therein a somewhat singular-looking machine, in a\r\n      very dexterous manner, that I could not altogether comprehend.\r\n      The alteration, however, in the entire expression of the\r\n      General’s countenance was instantaneous and surprising. When he\r\n      again spoke, his voice had resumed all that rich melody and\r\n      strength which I had noticed upon our original introduction.\r\n\r\n      “D—n the vagabonds!” said he, in so clear a tone that I\r\n      positively started at the change, “D—n the vagabonds! they not\r\n      only knocked in the roof of my mouth, but took the trouble to cut\r\n      off at least seven-eighths of my tongue. There isn’t Bonfanti’s\r\n      equal, however, in America, for really good articles of this\r\n      description. I can recommend you to him with confidence,” [here\r\n      the General bowed,] “and assure you that I have the greatest\r\n      pleasure in so doing.”\r\n\r\n      I acknowledged his kindness in my best manner, and took leave of\r\n      him at once, with a perfect understanding of the true state of\r\n      affairs—with a full comprehension of the mystery which had\r\n      troubled me so long. It was evident. It was a clear case. Brevet\r\n      Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith was the man—was _the man\r\n      that was used up_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUSINESS MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod is the soul of business.—OLD SAYING.\r\n\r\n      I am a business man. I am a methodical man. Method is the thing,\r\n      after all. But there are no people I more heartily despise than\r\n      your eccentric fools who prate about method without understanding\r\n      it; attending strictly to its letter, and violating its spirit.\r\n      These fellows are always doing the most out-of-the-way things in\r\n      what they call an orderly manner. Now here, I conceive, is a\r\n      positive paradox. True method appertains to the ordinary and the\r\n      obvious alone, and cannot be applied to the _outré_. What\r\n      definite idea can a body attach to such expressions as\r\n      “methodical Jack o’ Dandy,” or “a systematical Will o’ the Wisp”?\r\n\r\n      My notions upon this head might not have been so clear as they\r\n      are, but for a fortunate accident which happened to me when I was\r\n      a very little boy. A good-hearted old Irish nurse (whom I shall\r\n      not forget in my will) took me up one day by the heels, when I\r\n      was making more noise than was necessary, and swinging me round\r\n      two or three times, d—d my eyes for “a skreeking little\r\n      spalpeen,” and then knocked my head into a cocked hat against the\r\n      bedpost. This, I say, decided my fate, and made my fortune. A\r\n      bump arose at once on my sinciput, and turned out to be as pretty\r\n      an organ of order as one shall see on a summer’s day. Hence that\r\n      positive appetite for system and regularity which has made me the\r\n      distinguished man of business that I am.\r\n\r\n      If there is any thing on earth I hate, it is a genius. Your\r\n      geniuses are all arrant asses—the greater the genius the greater\r\n      the ass—and to this rule there is no exception whatever.\r\n      Especially, you cannot make a man of business out of a genius,\r\n      any more than money out of a Jew, or the best nutmegs out of\r\n      pine-knots. The creatures are always going off at a tangent into\r\n      some fantastic employment, or ridiculous speculation, entirely at\r\n      variance with the “fitness of things,” and having no business\r\n      whatever to be considered as a business at all. Thus you may tell\r\n      these characters immediately by the nature of their occupations.\r\n      If you ever perceive a man setting up as a merchant or a\r\n      manufacturer, or going into the cotton or tobacco trade, or any\r\n      of those eccentric pursuits; or getting to be a drygoods dealer,\r\n      or soap-boiler, or something of that kind; or pretending to be a\r\n      lawyer, or a blacksmith, or a physician—any thing out of the\r\n      usual way—you may set him down at once as a genius, and then,\r\n      according to the rule-of-three, he’s an ass.\r\n\r\n      Now I am not in any respect a genius, but a regular business man.\r\n      My day-book and ledger will evince this in a minute. They are\r\n      well kept, though I say it myself; and, in my general habits of\r\n      accuracy and punctuality, I am not to be beat by a clock.\r\n      Moreover, my occupations have been always made to chime in with\r\n      the ordinary habitudes of my fellowmen. Not that I feel the least\r\n      indebted, upon this score, to my exceedingly weak-minded parents,\r\n      who, beyond doubt, would have made an arrant genius of me at\r\n      last, if my guardian angel had not come, in good time, to the\r\n      rescue. In biography the truth is every thing, and in\r\n      autobiography it is especially so—yet I scarcely hope to be\r\n      believed when I state, however solemnly, that my poor father put\r\n      me, when I was about fifteen years of age, into the\r\n      counting-house of what be termed “a respectable hardware and\r\n      commission merchant doing a capital bit of business!” A capital\r\n      bit of fiddlestick! However, the consequence of this folly was,\r\n      that in two or three days, I had to be sent home to my\r\n      button-headed family in a high state of fever, and with a most\r\n      violent and dangerous pain in the sinciput, all around about my\r\n      organ of order. It was nearly a gone case with me then—just\r\n      touch-and-go for six weeks—the physicians giving me up and all\r\n      that sort of thing. But, although I suffered much, I was a\r\n      thankful boy in the main. I was saved from being a “respectable\r\n      hardware and commission merchant, doing a capital bit of\r\n      business,” and I felt grateful to the protuberance which had been\r\n      the means of my salvation, as well as to the kindhearted female\r\n      who had originally put these means within my reach.\r\n\r\n      The most of boys run away from home at ten or twelve years of\r\n      age, but I waited till I was sixteen. I don’t know that I should\r\n      have gone even then, if I had not happened to hear my old mother\r\n      talk about setting me up on my own hook in the grocery way. The\r\n      grocery way!—only think of that! I resolved to be off forthwith,\r\n      and try and establish myself in some decent occupation, without\r\n      dancing attendance any longer upon the caprices of these\r\n      eccentric old people, and running the risk of being made a genius\r\n      of in the end. In this project I succeeded perfectly well at the\r\n      first effort, and by the time I was fairly eighteen, found myself\r\n      doing an extensive and profitable business in the Tailor’s\r\n      Walking-Advertisement line.\r\n\r\n      I was enabled to discharge the onerous duties of this profession,\r\n      only by that rigid adherence to system which formed the leading\r\n      feature of my mind. A scrupulous method characterized my actions\r\n      as well as my accounts. In my case it was method—not money—which\r\n      made the man: at least all of him that was not made by the tailor\r\n      whom I served. At nine, every morning, I called upon that\r\n      individual for the clothes of the day. Ten o’clock found me in\r\n      some fashionable promenade or other place of public amusement.\r\n      The precise regularity with which I turned my handsome person\r\n      about, so as to bring successively into view every portion of the\r\n      suit upon my back, was the admiration of all the knowing men in\r\n      the trade. Noon never passed without my bringing home a customer\r\n      to the house of my employers, Messrs. Cut & Comeagain. I say this\r\n      proudly, but with tears in my eyes—for the firm proved themselves\r\n      the basest of ingrates. The little account, about which we\r\n      quarreled and finally parted, cannot, in any item, be thought\r\n      overcharged, by gentlemen really conversant with the nature of\r\n      the business. Upon this point, however, I feel a degree of proud\r\n      satisfaction in permitting the reader to judge for himself. My\r\n      bill ran thus:\r\n\r\n_Messrs. Cut & Comeagain, Merchant Tailors.\r\nTo Peter Proffit, Walking Advertiser,_ Drs.\r\n\r\nJuly 10.   to promenade, as usual and customer brought home   $00 25\r\nJuly 11.

Upon my word of honor, this\r\n      was not an unreasonable price for that dickey. It was one of the\r\n      cleanest and prettiest little dickeys I ever saw; and I have good\r\n      reason to believe that it effected the sale of three Petershams.\r\n      The elder partner of the firm, however, would allow me only one\r\n      penny of the charge, and took it upon himself to show in what\r\n      manner four of the same sized conveniences could be got out of a\r\n      sheet of foolscap. But it is needless to say that I stood upon\r\n      the principle of the thing. Business is business, and should be\r\n      done in a business way. There was no system whatever in swindling\r\n      me out of a penny—a clear fraud of fifty per cent—no method in\r\n      any respect. I left at once the employment of Messrs. Cut &\r\n      Comeagain, and set up in the Eye-Sore line by myself—one of the\r\n      most lucrative, respectable, and independent of the ordinary\r\n      occupations.\r\n\r\n      My strict integrity, economy, and rigorous business habits, here\r\n      again came into play. I found myself driving a flourishing trade,\r\n      and soon became a marked man upon “Change.” The truth is, I never\r\n      dabbled in flashy matters, but jogged on in the good old sober\r\n      routine of the calling—a calling in which I should, no doubt,\r\n      have remained to the present hour, but for a little accident\r\n      which happened to me in the prosecution of one of the usual\r\n      business operations of the profession. Whenever a rich old hunks\r\n      or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets into the notion of\r\n      putting up a palace, there is no such thing in the world as\r\n      stopping either of them, and this every intelligent person knows.\r\n      The fact in question is indeed the basis of the Eye-Sore trade.\r\n      As soon, therefore, as a building-project is fairly afoot by one\r\n      of these parties, we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in\r\n      contemplation, or a prime little situation just adjoining, or\r\n      tight in front. This done, we wait until the palace is half-way\r\n      up, and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an\r\n      ornamental mud hovel, right against it; or a Down-East or Dutch\r\n      Pagoda, or a pig-sty, or an ingenious little bit of fancy work,\r\n      either Esquimau, Kickapoo, or Hottentot. Of course we can’t\r\n      afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five\r\n      hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster. Can\r\n      we? I ask the question. I ask it of business men. It would be\r\n      irrational to suppose that we can. And yet there was a rascally\r\n      corporation which asked me to do this very thing—this very thing!\r\n      I did not reply to their absurd proposition, of course; but I\r\n      felt it a duty to go that same night, and lamp-black the whole of\r\n      their palace. For this the unreasonable villains clapped me into\r\n      jail; and the gentlemen of the Eye-Sore trade could not well\r\n      avoid cutting my connection when I came out.\r\n\r\n      The Assault-and-Battery business, into which I was now forced to\r\n      adventure for a livelihood, was somewhat ill-adapted to the\r\n      delicate nature of my constitution; but I went to work in it with\r\n      a good heart, and found my account here, as heretofore, in those\r\n      stern habits of methodical accuracy which had been thumped into\r\n      me by that delightful old nurse—I would indeed be the basest of\r\n      men not to remember her well in my will. By observing, as I say,\r\n      the strictest system in all my dealings, and keeping a\r\n      well-regulated set of books, I was enabled to get over many\r\n      serious difficulties, and, in the end, to establish myself very\r\n      decently in the profession. The truth is, that few individuals,\r\n      in any line, did a snugger little business than I. I will just\r\n      copy a page or so out of my Day-Book; and this will save me the\r\n      necessity of blowing my own trumpet—a contemptible practice of\r\n      which no high-minded man will be guilty. Now, the Day-Book is a\r\n      thing that don’t lie.\r\n\r\n      “Jan. 1.—New Year’s Day. Met Snap in the street, groggy.\r\n      Mem—he’ll do. Met Gruff shortly afterward, blind drunk. Mem—he’ll\r\n      answer, too. Entered both gentlemen in my Ledger, and opened a\r\n      running account with each.\r\n\r\n      “Jan. 2.—Saw Snap at the Exchange, and went up and trod on his\r\n      toe. Doubled his fist and knocked me down. Good!—got up again.\r\n      Some trifling difficulty with Bag, my attorney. I want the\r\n      damages at a thousand, but he says that for so simple a knock\r\n      down we can’t lay them at more than five hundred. Mem—must get\r\n      rid of Bag—no system at all.\r\n\r\n      “Jan. 3.—Went to the theatre, to look for Gruff. Saw him sitting\r\n      in a side box, in the second tier, between a fat lady and a lean\r\n      one. Quizzed the whole party through an opera-glass, till I saw\r\n      the fat lady blush and whisper to G. Went round, then, into the\r\n      box, and put my nose within reach of his hand. Wouldn’t pull\r\n      it—no go. Blew it, and tried again—no go. Sat down then, and\r\n      winked at the lean lady, when I had the high satisfaction of\r\n      finding him lift me up by the nape of the neck, and fling me over\r\n      into the pit. Neck dislocated, and right leg capitally\r\n      splintered. Went home in high glee, drank a bottle of champagne,\r\n      and booked the young man for five thousand. Bag says it’ll do.\r\n\r\n      “Feb. 15.—Compromised the case of Mr. Snap. Amount entered in\r\n      Journal—fifty cents—which see.\r\n\r\n      “Feb. 16.—Cast by that ruffian, Gruff, who made me a present of\r\n      five dollars. Costs of suit, four dollars and twenty-five cents.\r\n      Nett profit,—see Journal,—seventy-five cents.”\r\n\r\n      Now, here is a clear gain, in a very brief period, of no less\r\n      than one dollar and twenty-five cents—this is in the mere cases\r\n      of Snap and Gruff; and I solemnly assure the reader that these\r\n      extracts are taken at random from my Day-Book.\r\n\r\n      It’s an old saying, and a true one, however, that money is\r\n      nothing in comparison with health. I found the exactions of the\r\n      profession somewhat too much for my delicate state of body; and,\r\n      discovering, at last, that I was knocked all out of shape, so\r\n      that I didn’t know very well what to make of the matter, and so\r\n      that my friends, when they met me in the street, couldn’t tell\r\n      that I was Peter Proffit at all, it occurred to me that the best\r\n      expedient I could adopt was to alter my line of business. I\r\n      turned my attention, therefore, to Mud-Dabbling, and continued it\r\n      for some years.\r\n\r\n      The worst of this occupation is, that too many people take a\r\n      fancy to it, and the competition is in consequence excessive.\r\n      Every ignoramus of a fellow who finds that he hasn’t brains in\r\n      sufficient quantity to make his way as a walking advertiser, or\r\n      an eye-sore prig, or a salt-and-batter man, thinks, of course,\r\n      that he’ll answer very well as a dabbler of mud. But there never\r\n      was entertained a more erroneous idea than that it requires no\r\n      brains to mud-dabble. Especially, there is nothing to be made in\r\n      this way without method. I did only a retail business myself, but\r\n      my old habits of system carried me swimmingly along. I selected\r\n      my street-crossing, in the first place, with great deliberation,\r\n      and I never put down a broom in any part of the town but that. I\r\n      took care, too, to have a nice little puddle at hand, which I\r\n      could get at in a minute. By these means I got to be well known\r\n      as a man to be trusted; and this is one-half the battle, let me\r\n      tell you, in trade. Nobody ever failed to pitch me a copper, and\r\n      got over my crossing with a clean pair of pantaloons. And, as my\r\n      business habits, in this respect, were sufficiently understood, I\r\n      never met with any attempt at imposition. I wouldn’t have put up\r\n      with it, if I had. Never imposing upon any one myself, I suffered\r\n      no one to play the possum with me. The frauds of the banks of\r\n      course I couldn’t help. Their suspension put me to ruinous\r\n      inconvenience. These, however, are not individuals, but\r\n      corporations; and corporations, it is very well known, have\r\n      neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be damned.\r\n\r\n      I was making money at this business when, in an evil moment, I\r\n      was induced to merge it in the Cur-Spattering—a somewhat\r\n      analogous, but, by no means, so respectable a profession. My\r\n      location, to be sure, was an excellent one, being central, and I\r\n      had capital blacking and brushes. My little dog, too, was quite\r\n      fat and up to all varieties of snuff. He had been in the trade a\r\n      long time, and, I may say, understood it. Our general routine was\r\n      this:—Pompey, having rolled himself well in the mud, sat upon end\r\n      at the shop door, until he observed a dandy approaching in bright\r\n      boots. He then proceeded to meet him, and gave the Wellingtons a\r\n      rub or two with his wool. Then the dandy swore very much, and\r\n      looked about for a boot-black. There I was, full in his view,\r\n      with blacking and brushes. It was only a minute’s work, and then\r\n      came a sixpence. This did moderately well for a time;—in fact, I\r\n      was not avaricious, but my dog was. I allowed him a third of the\r\n      profit, but he was advised to insist upon half. This I couldn’t\r\n      stand—so we quarrelled and parted.\r\n\r\n      I next tried my hand at the Organ-Grinding for a while, and may\r\n      say that I made out pretty well. It is a plain, straightforward\r\n      business, and requires no particular abilities. You can get a\r\n      music-mill for a mere song, and to put it in order, you have but\r\n      to open the works, and give them three or four smart raps with a\r\n      hammer. It improves the tone of the thing, for business purposes,\r\n      more than you can imagine. This done, you have only to stroll\r\n      along, with the mill on your back, until you see tanbark in the\r\n      street, and a knocker wrapped up in buckskin. Then you stop and\r\n      grind; looking as if you meant to stop and grind till doomsday.\r\n      Presently a window opens, and somebody pitches you a sixpence,\r\n      with a request to “Hush up and go on,” etc. I am aware that some\r\n      grinders have actually afforded to “go on” for this sum; but for\r\n      my part, I found the necessary outlay of capital too great to\r\n      permit of my “going on” under a shilling.\r\n\r\n      At this occupation I did a good deal; but, somehow, I was not\r\n      quite satisfied, and so finally abandoned it. The truth is, I\r\n      labored under the disadvantage of having no monkey—and American\r\n      streets are so muddy, and a Democratic rabble is so obstrusive,\r\n      and so full of demnition mischievous little boys.\r\n\r\n      I was now out of employment for some months, but at length\r\n      succeeded, by dint of great interest, in procuring a situation in\r\n      the Sham-Post. The duties, here, are simple, and not altogether\r\n      unprofitable. For example:—very early in the morning I had to\r\n      make up my packet of sham letters. Upon the inside of each of\r\n      these I had to scrawl a few lines on any subject which occurred\r\n      to me as sufficiently mysterious—signing all the epistles Tom\r\n      Dobson, or Bobby Tompkins, or anything in that way. Having folded\r\n      and sealed all, and stamped them with sham postmarks—New Orleans,\r\n      Bengal, Botany Bay, or any other place a great way off—I set out,\r\n      forthwith, upon my daily route, as if in a very great hurry. I\r\n      always called at the big houses to deliver the letters, and\r\n      receive the postage. Nobody hesitates at paying for a\r\n      letter—especially for a double one—people are such fools—and it\r\n      was no trouble to get round a corner before there was time to\r\n      open the epistles. The worst of this profession was, that I had\r\n      to walk so much and so fast; and so frequently to vary my route.\r\n      Besides, I had serious scruples of conscience. I can’t bear to\r\n      hear innocent individuals abused—and the way the whole town took\r\n      to cursing Tom Dobson and Bobby Tompkins was really awful to\r\n      hear. I washed my hands of the matter in disgust.\r\n\r\n      My eighth and last speculation has been in the Cat-Growing way. I\r\n      have found that a most pleasant and lucrative business, and,\r\n      really, no trouble at all. The country, it is well known, has\r\n      become infested with cats—so much so of late, that a petition for\r\n      relief, most numerously and respectably signed, was brought\r\n      before the Legislature at its late memorable session. The\r\n      Assembly, at this epoch, was unusually well-informed, and, having\r\n      passed many other wise and wholesome enactments, it crowned all\r\n      with the Cat-Act. In its original form, this law offered a\r\n      premium for cat-heads (fourpence a-piece), but the Senate\r\n      succeeded in amending the main clause, so as to substitute the\r\n      word “tails” for “heads.” This amendment was so obviously proper,\r\n      that the House concurred in it nem. con.\r\n\r\n      As soon as the governor had signed the bill, I invested my whole\r\n      estate in the purchase of Toms and Tabbies. At first I could only\r\n      afford to feed them upon mice (which are cheap), but they\r\n      fulfilled the scriptural injunction at so marvellous a rate, that\r\n      I at length considered it my best policy to be liberal, and so\r\n      indulged them in oysters and turtle. Their tails, at a\r\n      legislative price, now bring me in a good income; for I have\r\n      discovered a way, in which, by means of Macassar oil, I can force\r\n      three crops in a year. It delights me to find, too, that the\r\n      animals soon get accustomed to the thing, and would rather have\r\n      the appendages cut off than otherwise. I consider myself,\r\n      therefore, a made man, and am bargaining for a country-seat on\r\n      the Hudson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LANDSCAPE GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\n     The garden like a lady fair was cut\r\n         That lay as if she slumbered in delight,\r\n     And to the open skies her eyes did shut;\r\n         The azure fields of heaven were ’sembled right\r\n         In a large round set with flow’rs of light:\r\n     The flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew\r\n     That hung upon their azure leaves, did show\r\n     Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the ev’ning blue.\r\n                    —GILES FLETCHER\r\n\r\n      No more remarkable man ever lived than my friend, the young\r\n      Ellison. He was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion\r\n      of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune. From his cradle\r\n      to his grave, a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along.\r\n      Nor do I use the word Prosperity in its mere wordly or external\r\n      sense. I mean it as synonymous with happiness. The person of whom\r\n      I speak, seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild\r\n      doctrines of Turgot, Price, Priestley, and Condorcet—of\r\n      exemplifying, by individual instance, what has been deemed the\r\n      mere chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief existence of\r\n      Ellison, I fancy, that I have seen refuted the dogma—that in\r\n      man’s physical and spiritual nature, lies some hidden principle,\r\n      the antagonist of Bliss. An intimate and anxious examination of\r\n      his career, has taught me to understand that, in general, from\r\n      the violation of a few simple laws of Humanity, arises the\r\n      Wretchedness of mankind; that, as a species, we have in our\r\n      possession the as yet unwrought elements of Content,—and that\r\n      even now, in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on\r\n      the great question of the Social Condition, it is not impossible\r\n      that Man, the individual, under certain unusual and highly\r\n      fortuitous conditions, may be happy.\r\n\r\n      With opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued; and\r\n      thus is it especially worthy of observation that the\r\n      uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great\r\n      part the result of preconcert. It is, indeed evident, that with\r\n      less of the instinctive philosophy which, now and then, stands so\r\n      well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison would have found\r\n      himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary successes of his\r\n      life, into the common vortex of Unhappiness which yawns for those\r\n      of preeminent endowments. But it is by no means my present object\r\n      to pen an essay on Happiness. The ideas of my friend may be\r\n      summed up in a few words. He admitted but four unvarying laws, or\r\n      rather elementary principles, of Bliss. That which he considered\r\n      chief, was (strange to say!) the simple and purely physical one\r\n      of free exercise in the open air. “The health,” he said,\r\n      “attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name.”\r\n      He pointed to the tillers of the earth—the only people who, as a\r\n      class, are proverbially more happy than others—and then he\r\n      instanced the high ecstasies of the fox-hunter. His second\r\n      principle was the love of woman. His third was the contempt of\r\n      ambition. His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he\r\n      held that, other things being equal, the extent of happiness was\r\n      proportioned to the spirituality of this object.\r\n\r\n      I have said that Ellison was remarkable in the continuous\r\n      profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by Fortune. In personal\r\n      grace and beauty he exceeded all men. His intellect was of that\r\n      order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a\r\n      necessity and an intuition. His family was one of the most\r\n      illustrious of the empire. His bride was the loveliest and most\r\n      devoted of women. His possessions had been always ample; but,\r\n      upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year, it was\r\n      discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of Fate had\r\n      been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world\r\n      amid which they occur, and seldom fail radically to alter the\r\n      entire moral constitution of those who are their objects. It\r\n      appears that about one hundred years prior to Mr. Ellison’s\r\n      attainment of his majority, there had died, in a remote province,\r\n      one Mr. Seabright Ellison. This gentlemen had amassed a princely\r\n      fortune, and, having no very immediate connexions, conceived the\r\n      whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after\r\n      his decease. Minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes\r\n      of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest\r\n      of blood, bearing the name Ellison, who should be alive at the\r\n      end of the hundred years. Many futile attempts had been made to\r\n      set aside this singular bequest; their ex post facto character\r\n      rendered them abortive; but the attention of a jealous government\r\n      was aroused, and a decree finally obtained, forbidding all\r\n      similar accumulations. This act did not prevent young Ellison,\r\n      upon his twenty-first birth-day, from entering into possession,\r\n      as the heir of his ancestor, Seabright, of a fortune of four\r\n      hundred and fifty millions of dollars. {*1}\r\n\r\n      When it had become definitely known that such was the enormous\r\n      wealth inherited, there were, of course, many speculations as to\r\n      the mode of its disposal. The gigantic magnitude and the\r\n      immediately available nature of the sum, dazzled and bewildered\r\n      all who thought upon the topic. The possessor of any appreciable\r\n      amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a\r\n      thousand things. With riches merely surpassing those of any\r\n      citizen, it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to\r\n      supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time; or\r\n      busying himself with political intrigues; or aiming at\r\n      ministerial power; or purchasing increase of nobility, or\r\n      devising gorgeous architectural piles; or collecting large\r\n      specimens of Virtu; or playing the munificent patron of Letters\r\n      and Art; or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive\r\n      institutions of charity. But, for the inconceivable wealth in the\r\n      actual possession of the young heir, these objects and all\r\n      ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate. Recourse was had to\r\n      figures; and figures but sufficed to confound. It was seen, that\r\n      even at three per cent, the annual income of the inheritance\r\n      amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred\r\n      thousand dollars; which was one million and one hundred and\r\n      twenty-five thousand per month; or thirty-six thousand, nine\r\n      hundred and eighty-six per day, or one thousand five hundred and\r\n      forty-one per hour, or six and twenty dollars for every minute\r\n      that flew. Thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly\r\n      broken up. Men knew not what to imagine. There were some who even\r\n      conceived that Mr. Ellison would divest himself forthwith of at\r\n      least two-thirds of his fortune as of utterly superfluous\r\n      opulence; enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of\r\n      his superabundance.\r\n\r\n      I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made\r\n      up his mind upon a topic which had occasioned so much of\r\n      discussion to his friends. Nor was I greatly astonished at the\r\n      nature of his decision. In the widest and noblest sense, he was a\r\n      poet. He comprehended, moreover, the true character, the august\r\n      aims, the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment.\r\n      The proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt\r\n      to lie in the creation of novel forms of Beauty. Some\r\n      peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the nature of\r\n      his intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism the\r\n      whole cast of his ethical speculations; and it was this bias,\r\n      perhaps, which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most\r\n      advantageous, if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise\r\n      of the poetic sentiment, was to be found in the creation of novel\r\n      moods of purely physical loveliness. Thus it happened that he\r\n      became neither musician nor poet; if we use this latter term in\r\n      its every-day acceptation. Or it might have been that he became\r\n      neither the one nor the other, in pursuance of an idea of his\r\n      which I have already mentioned—the idea, that in the contempt of\r\n      ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on\r\n      earth. Is it not, indeed, possible that while a high order of\r\n      genius is necessarily ambitious, the highest is invariably above\r\n      that which is termed ambition? And may it not thus happen that\r\n      many far greater than Milton, have contentedly remained “mute and\r\n      inglorious?” I believe the world has never yet seen, and that,\r\n      unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order\r\n      of mind into distasteful exertion, the world will never behold,\r\n      that full extent of triumphant execution, in the richer\r\n      productions of Art, of which the human nature is absolutely\r\n      capable.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man\r\n      lived more profoundly enamored both of Music and the Muse. Under\r\n      other circumstances than those which invested him, it is not\r\n      impossible that he would have become a painter. The field of\r\n      sculpture, although in its nature rigidly poetical, was too\r\n      limited in its extent and in its consequences, to have occupied,\r\n      at any time, much of his attention. And I have now mentioned all\r\n      the provinces in which even the most liberal understanding of the\r\n      poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of\r\n      expatiating. I mean the most liberal public or recognized\r\n      conception of the idea involved in the phrase “poetic sentiment.”\r\n      But Mr. Ellison imagined that the richest, and altogether the\r\n      most natural and most suitable province, had been blindly\r\n      neglected. No definition had spoken of the Landscape-Gardener, as\r\n      of the poet; yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the\r\n      creation of the Landscape-Garden offered to the true muse the\r\n      most magnificent of opportunities. Here was, indeed, the fairest\r\n      field for the display of invention, or imagination, in the\r\n      endless combining of forms of novel Beauty; the elements which\r\n      should enter into combination being, at all times, and by a vast\r\n      superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. In\r\n      the multiform of the tree, and in the multicolor of the flower,\r\n      he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of\r\n      Nature at physical loveliness. And in the direction or\r\n      concentration of this effort, or, still more properly, in its\r\n      adaption to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth, he\r\n      perceived that he should be employing the best means—laboring to\r\n      the greatest advantage—in the fulfilment of his destiny as Poet.\r\n\r\n      “Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth.”\r\n      In his explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much\r\n      towards solving what has always seemed to me an enigma. I mean\r\n      the fact (which none but the ignorant dispute) that no such\r\n      combinations of scenery exist in Nature as the painter of genius\r\n      has in his power to produce. No such Paradises are to be found in\r\n      reality as have glowed upon the canvass of Claude. In the most\r\n      enchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a\r\n      defect or an excess—many excesses and defects. While the\r\n      component parts may exceed, individually, the highest skill of\r\n      the artist, the arrangement of the parts will always be\r\n      susceptible of improvement. In short, no position can be\r\n      attained, from which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will\r\n      not find matter of offence, in what is technically termed the\r\n      composition of a natural landscape. And yet how unintelligible is\r\n      this! In all other matters we are justly instructed to regard\r\n      Nature as supreme. With her details we shrink from competition.\r\n      Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or to\r\n      improve the proportions of the lily of the valley? The criticism\r\n      which says, of sculpture or of portraiture, that “Nature is to be\r\n      exalted rather than imitated,” is in error. No pictorial or\r\n      sculptural combinations of points of human loveliness, do more\r\n      than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it\r\n      gladdens our daily path. Byron, who often erred, erred not in\r\n      saying, I’ve seen more living beauty, ripe and real, than all the\r\n      nonsense of their stone ideal. In landscape alone is the\r\n      principle of the critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it\r\n      is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced\r\n      him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of Art.\r\n      Having, I say, felt its truth here. For the feeling is no\r\n      affectation or chimera. The mathematics afford no more absolute\r\n      demonstrations, than the sentiment of his Art yields to the\r\n      artist. He not only believes, but positively knows, that such and\r\n      such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter, or form,\r\n      constitute, and alone constitute, the true Beauty. Yet his\r\n      reasons have not yet been matured into expression. It remains for\r\n      a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen, fully to\r\n      investigate and express them. Nevertheless is he confirmed in his\r\n      instinctive opinions, by the concurrence of all his compeers. Let\r\n      a composition be defective; let an emendation be wrought in its\r\n      mere arrangement of form; let this emendation be submitted to\r\n      every artist in the world; by each will its necessity be\r\n      admitted. And even far more than this, in remedy of the defective\r\n      composition, each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest\r\n      the identical emendation.\r\n\r\n      I repeat that in landscape arrangements, or collocations alone,\r\n      is the physical Nature susceptible of “exaltation” and that,\r\n      therefore, her susceptibility of improvement at this one point,\r\n      was a mystery which, hitherto I had been unable to solve. It was\r\n      Mr. Ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as\r\n      improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty, was really such,\r\n      as respected only the mortal or human point of view; that each\r\n      alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly\r\n      effect a blemish in the picture, if we could suppose this picture\r\n      viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens. “It is\r\n      easily understood,” says Mr. Ellison, “that what might improve a\r\n      closely scrutinized detail, might, at the same time, injure a\r\n      general and more distantly observed effect.” He spoke upon this\r\n      topic with warmth: regarding not so much its immediate or obvious\r\n      importance (which is little), as the character of the conclusions\r\n      to which it might lead, or of the collateral propositions which\r\n      it might serve to corroborate or sustain. There might be a class\r\n      of beings, human once, but now to humanity invisible, for whose\r\n      scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful,\r\n      more especially than for our own, had been set in order by God\r\n      the great landscape-garden of the whole earth.\r\n\r\n      In the course of our discussion, my young friend took occasion to\r\n      quote some passages from a writer who has been supposed to have\r\n      well treated this theme.\r\n\r\n      “There are, properly,” he writes, “but two styles of\r\n      landscape-gardening, the natural and the artificial. One seeks to\r\n      recall the original beauty of the country, by adapting its means\r\n      to the surrounding scenery; cultivating trees in harmony with the\r\n      hills or plain of the neighboring land; detecting and bringing\r\n      into practice those nice relations of size, proportion and color\r\n      which, hid from the common observer, are revealed everywhere to\r\n      the experienced student of nature. The result of the natural\r\n      style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all defects\r\n      and incongruities—in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and\r\n      order, than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles.\r\n      The artificial style has as many varieties as there are different\r\n      tastes to gratify. It has a certain general relation to the\r\n      various styles of building. There are the stately avenues and\r\n      retirements of Versailles; Italian terraces; and a various mixed\r\n      old English style, which bears some relation to the domestic\r\n      Gothic or English Elizabethan architecture. Whatever may be said\r\n      against the abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a\r\n      mixture of pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty.\r\n      This is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of order and\r\n      design, and partly moral. A terrace, with an old moss-covered\r\n      balustrade, calls up at once to the eye, the fair forms that have\r\n      passed there in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is an\r\n      evidence of care and human interest.”\r\n\r\n      “From what I have already observed,” said Mr. Ellison, “you will\r\n      understand that I reject the idea, here expressed, of ‘recalling\r\n      the original beauty of the country.’ The original beauty is never\r\n      so great as that which may be introduced. Of course, much depends\r\n      upon the selection of a spot with capabilities. What is said in\r\n      respect to the ‘detecting and bringing into practice those nice\r\n      relations of size, proportion and color,’ is a mere vagueness of\r\n      speech, which may mean much, or little, or nothing, and which\r\n      guides in no degree. That the true ‘result of the natural style\r\n      of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and\r\n      incongruities, than in the creation of any special wonders or\r\n      miracles,’ is a proposition better suited to the grovelling\r\n      apprehension of the herd, than to the fervid dreams of the man of\r\n      genius. The merit suggested is, at best, negative, and appertains\r\n      to that hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate\r\n      Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while that merit which\r\n      consists in the mere avoiding demerit, appeals directly to the\r\n      understanding, and can thus be foreshadowed in Rule, the loftier\r\n      merit, which breathes and flames in invention or creation, can be\r\n      apprehended solely in its results. Rule applies but to the\r\n      excellences of avoidance—to the virtues which deny or refrain.\r\n      Beyond these the critical art can but suggest. We may be\r\n      instructed to build an Odyssey, but it is in vain that we are\r\n      told how to conceive a ‘Tempest,’ an ‘Inferno,’ a ‘Prometheus\r\n      Bound,’ a ‘Nightingale,’ such as that of Keats, or the ‘Sensitive\r\n      Plant’ of Shelley. But, the thing done, the wonder accomplished,\r\n      and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. The sophists\r\n      of the negative school, who, through inability to create, have\r\n      scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. What,\r\n      in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure\r\n      reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort\r\n      admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the\r\n      sublime.\r\n\r\n      “Our author’s observations on the artificial style of gardening,”\r\n      continued Mr. Ellison, “are less objectionable. ‘A mixture of\r\n      pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty.’ This is\r\n      just, and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally\r\n      so. I repeat that the principle here expressed, is\r\n      incontrovertible; but there may be something even beyond it.\r\n      There may be an object in full keeping with the principle\r\n      suggested—an object unattainable by the means ordinarily in\r\n      possession of mankind, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm\r\n      to the landscape-garden immeasurably surpassing that which a\r\n      merely human interest could bestow. The true poet possessed of\r\n      very unusual pecuniary resources, might possibly, while retaining\r\n      the necessary idea of art or interest or culture, so imbue his\r\n      designs at once with extent and novelty of Beauty, as to convey\r\n      the sentiment of spiritual interference. It will be seen that, in\r\n      bringing about such result, he secures all the advantages of\r\n      interest or design, while relieving his work of all the harshness\r\n      and technicality of Art. In the most rugged of wildernesses—in\r\n      the most savage of the scenes of pure Nature—there is apparent\r\n      the art of a Creator; yet is this art apparent only to\r\n      reflection; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling.\r\n      Now, if we imagine this sense of the Almighty Design to be\r\n      harmonized in a measurable degree, if we suppose a landscape\r\n      whose combined strangeness, vastness, definitiveness, and\r\n      magnificence, shall inspire the idea of culture, or care, or\r\n      superintendence, on the part of intelligences superior yet akin\r\n      to humanity—then the sentiment of interest is preserved, while\r\n      the Art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary\r\n      Nature—a Nature which is not God, nor an emanation of God, but\r\n      which still is Nature, in the sense that it is the handiwork of\r\n      the angels that hover between man and God.”\r\n\r\n      It was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical\r\n      embodiment of a vision such as this—in the free exercise in the\r\n      open air, which resulted from personal direction of his plans—in\r\n      the continuous and unceasing object which these plans afforded—in\r\n      the high spirituality of the object itself—in the contempt of\r\n      ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affect—and,\r\n      lastly, it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted\r\n      wife, that Ellison thought to find, and found, an exemption from\r\n      the ordinary cares of Humanity, with a far greater amount of\r\n      positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De\r\n      Staël.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAELZEL’S CHESS-PLAYER\r\n\r\n\r\n      Perhaps no exhibition of the kind has ever elicited so general\r\n      attention as the Chess-Player of Maelzel. Wherever seen it has\r\n      been an object of intense curiosity, to all persons who think.\r\n      Yet the question of its _modus operandi_ is still undetermined.\r\n      Nothing has been written on this topic which can be considered as\r\n      decisive—and accordingly we find every where men of mechanical\r\n      genius, of great general acuteness, and discriminative\r\n      understanding, who make no scruple in pronouncing the Automaton a\r\n      _pure machine_, unconnected with human agency in its movements,\r\n      and consequently, beyond all comparison, the most astonishing of\r\n      the inventions of mankind. And such it would undoubtedly be, were\r\n      they right in their supposition. Assuming this hypothesis, it\r\n      would be grossly absurd to compare with the Chess-Player, any\r\n      similar thing of either modern or ancient days. Yet there have\r\n      been many and wonderful automata. In Brewster’s Letters on\r\n      Natural Magic, we have an account of the most remarkable. Among\r\n      these may be mentioned, as having beyond doubt existed, firstly,\r\n      the coach invented by M. Camus for the amusement of Louis XIV\r\n      when a child. A table, about four feet square, was introduced,\r\n      into the room appropriated for the exhibition. Upon this table\r\n      was placed a carriage, six inches in length, made of wood, and\r\n      drawn by two horses of the same material. One window being down,\r\n      a lady was seen on the back seat. A coachman held the reins on\r\n      the box, and a footman and page were in their places behind. M.\r\n      Camus now touched a spring; whereupon the coachman smacked his\r\n      whip, and the horses proceeded in a natural manner, along the\r\n      edge of the table, drawing after them the carriage. Having gone\r\n      as far as possible in this direction, a sudden turn was made to\r\n      the left, and the vehicle was driven at right angles to its\r\n      former course, and still closely along the edge of the table. In\r\n      this way the coach proceeded until it arrived opposite the chair\r\n      of the young prince. It then stopped, the page descended and\r\n      opened the door, the lady alighted, and presented a petition to\r\n      her sovereign. She then re-entered. The page put up the steps,\r\n      closed the door, and resumed his station. The coachman whipped\r\n      his horses, and the carriage was driven back to its original\r\n      position.\r\n\r\n      The magician of M. Maillardet is also worthy of notice. We copy\r\n      the following account of it from the _Letters_ before mentioned\r\n      of Dr. B., who derived his information principally from the\r\n      Edinburgh Encyclopaedia.\r\n\r\n      “One of the most popular pieces of mechanism which we have seen,\r\n      Is the Magician constructed by M. Maillardet, for the purpose of\r\n      answering certain given questions. A figure, dressed like a\r\n      magician, appears seated at the bottom of a wall, holding a wand\r\n      in one hand, and a book in the other A number of questions, ready\r\n      prepared, are inscribed on oval medallions, and the spectator\r\n      takes any of these he chooses and to which he wishes an answer,\r\n      and having placed it in a drawer ready to receive it, the drawer\r\n      shuts with a spring till the answer is returned. The magician\r\n      then arises from his seat, bows his head, describes circles with\r\n      his wand, and consulting the book as If in deep thought, he lifts\r\n      it towards his face. Having thus appeared to ponder over the\r\n      proposed question he raises his wand, and striking with it the\r\n      wall above his head, two folding doors fly open, and display an\r\n      appropriate answer to the question. The doors again close, the\r\n      magician resumes his original position, and the drawer opens to\r\n      return the medallion. There are twenty of these medallions, all\r\n      containing different questions, to which the magician returns the\r\n      most suitable and striking answers. The medallions are thin\r\n      plates of brass, of an elliptical form, exactly resembling each\r\n      other. Some of the medallions have a question inscribed on each\r\n      side, both of which the magician answered in succession. If the\r\n      drawer is shut without a medallion being put into it, the\r\n      magician rises, consults his book, shakes his head, and resumes\r\n      his seat. The folding doors remain shut, and the drawer is\r\n      returned empty. If two medallions are put into the drawer\r\n      together, an answer is returned only to the lower one. When the\r\n      machinery is wound up, the movements continue about an hour,\r\n      during which time about fifty questions may be answered. The\r\n      inventor stated that the means by which the different medallions\r\n      acted upon the machinery, so as to produce the proper answers to\r\n      the questions which they contained, were extremely simple.”\r\n\r\n      The duck of Vaucanson was still more remarkable. It was _of _the\r\n      size of life, and so perfect an imitation of the living animal\r\n      that all the spectators were deceived. It executed, says\r\n      Brewster, all the natural movements and gestures, it ate and\r\n      drank with avidity, performed all the quick motions of the head\r\n      and throat which are peculiar to the duck, and like it muddled\r\n      the water which it drank with its bill. It produced also the\r\n      sound of quacking in the most natural manner. In the anatomical\r\n      structure the artist exhibited the highest skill. Every bone in\r\n      the real duck had its representative In the automaton, and its\r\n      wings were anatomically exact. Every cavity, apophysis, and\r\n      curvature was imitated, and each bone executed its proper\r\n      movements. When corn was thrown down before it, the duck\r\n      stretched out its neck to pick it up, swallowed, and digested it.\r\n      {*1}\r\n\r\n      But if these machines were ingenious, what shall we think of the\r\n      calculating machine of Mr. Babbage? What shall we think of an\r\n      engine of wood and metal which can not only compute astronomical\r\n      and navigation tables to any given extent, but render the\r\n      exactitude of its operations mathematically certain through its\r\n      power of correcting its possible errors? What shall we think of a\r\n      machine which can not only accomplish all this, but actually\r\n      print off its elaborate results, when obtained, without the\r\n      slightest intervention of the intellect of man? It will, perhaps,\r\n      be said, in reply, that a machine such as we have described is\r\n      altogether above comparison with the Chess-Player of Maelzel. By\r\n      no means—it is altogether beneath it—that is to say provided we\r\n      assume (what should never for a moment be assumed) that the\r\n      Chess-Player is a _pure machine, _and performs its operations\r\n      without any immediate human agency. Arithmetical or algebraical\r\n      calculations are, from their very nature, fixed and determinate.\r\n      Certain _data _being given, certain results necessarily and\r\n      inevitably follow. These results have dependence upon nothing,\r\n      and are influenced by nothing but the _data _originally given.\r\n      And the question to be solved proceeds, or should proceed, to its\r\n      final determination, by a succession of unerring steps liable to\r\n      no change, and subject to no modification. This being the case,\r\n      we can without difficulty conceive the _possibility _of so\r\n      arranging a piece of mechanism, that upon starting In accordance\r\n      with the _data _of the question to be solved, it should continue\r\n      its movements regularly, progressively, and undeviatingly towards\r\n      the required solution, since these movements, however complex,\r\n      are never imagined to be otherwise than finite and determinate.\r\n      But the case is widely different with the Chess-Player. With him\r\n      there is no determinate progression. No one move in chess\r\n      necessarily follows upon any one other. From no particular\r\n      disposition of the men at one period of a game can we predicate\r\n      their disposition at a different period. Let us place the _first\r\n      move _in a game of chess, in juxta-position with the _data _of an\r\n      algebraical question, and their great difference will be\r\n      immediately perceived. From the latter—from the _data—_the second\r\n      step of the question, dependent thereupon, inevitably follows. It\r\n      is modelled by the _data. _It must be _thus _and not otherwise.\r\n      But from the first move in the game of chess no especial second\r\n      move follows of necessity. In the algebraical question, as it\r\n      proceeds towards solution, the _certainty _of its operations\r\n      remains altogether unimpaired. The second step having been a\r\n      consequence of the _data, _the third step is equally a\r\n      consequence of the second, the fourth of the third, the fifth of\r\n      the fourth, and so on, _and not possibly otherwise, _to the end.\r\n      But in proportion to the progress made in a game of chess, is the\r\n      _uncertainty _of each ensuing move. A few moves having been made,\r\n      _no _step is certain. Different spectators of the game would\r\n      advise different moves. All is then dependent upon the variable\r\n      judgment of the players. Now even granting (what should not be\r\n      granted) that the movements of the Automaton Chess-Player were in\r\n      themselves determinate, they would be necessarily interrupted and\r\n      disarranged by the indeterminate will of his antagonist. There is\r\n      then no analogy whatever between the operations of the\r\n      Chess-Player, and those of the calculating machine of Mr.\r\n      Babbage, and if we choose to call the former a _pure machine _we\r\n      must be prepared to admit that it is, beyond all comparison, the\r\n      most wonderful of the inventions of mankind. Its original\r\n      projector, however, Baron Kempelen, had no scruple in declaring\r\n      it to be a “very ordinary piece of mechanism—a _bagatelle _whose\r\n      effects appeared so marvellous only from the boldness of the\r\n      conception, and the fortunate choice of the methods adopted for\r\n      promoting the illusion.” But it is needless to dwell upon this\r\n      point. It is quite certain that the operations of the Automaton\r\n      are regulated by _mind, _and by nothing else. Indeed this matter\r\n      is susceptible of a mathematical demonstration, _a priori. _The\r\n      only question then is of the _manner _in which human agency is\r\n      brought to bear. Before entering upon this subject it would be as\r\n      well to give a brief history and description of the Chess-Player\r\n      for the benefit of such of our readers as may never have had an\r\n      opportunity of witnessing Mr. Maelzel’s exhibition.\r\n\r\n      The Automaton Chess-Player was invented in 1769, by Baron\r\n      Kempelen, a nobleman of Presburg, in Hungary, who afterwards\r\n      disposed of it, together with the secret of its operations, to\r\n      its present possessor. {2*} Soon after its completion it was\r\n      exhibited in Presburg, Paris, Vienna, and other continental\r\n      cities. In 1783 and 1784, it was taken to London by Mr. Maelzel.\r\n      Of late years it has visited the principal towns in the United\r\n      States. Wherever seen, the most intense curiosity was excited by\r\n      its appearance, and numerous have been the attempts, by men of\r\n      all classes, to fathom the mystery of its evolutions. The cut on\r\n      this page gives a tolerable representation of the figure as seen\r\n      by the citizens of Richmond a few weeks ago. The right arm,\r\n      however, should lie more at length upon the box, a chess-board\r\n      should appear upon it, and the cushion should not be seen while\r\n      the pipe is held. Some immaterial alterations have been made in\r\n      the costume of the player since it came into the possession of\r\n      Maelzel—the plume, for example, was not originally worn. {image\r\n      of automaton}\r\n\r\n      At the hour appointed for exhibition, a curtain is withdrawn, or\r\n      folding doors are thrown open, and the machine rolled to within\r\n      about twelve feet of the nearest of the spectators, between whom\r\n      and it (the machine) a rope is stretched. A figure is seen\r\n      habited as a Turk, and seated, with its legs crossed, at a large\r\n      box apparently of maple wood, which serves it as a table. The\r\n      exhibiter will, if requested, roll the machine to any portion of\r\n      the room, suffer it to remain altogether on any designated spot,\r\n      or even shift its location repeatedly during the progress of a\r\n      game. The bottom of the box is elevated considerably above the\r\n      floor by means of the castors or brazen rollers on which it\r\n      moves, a clear view of the surface immediately beneath the\r\n      Automaton being thus afforded to the spectators. The chair on\r\n      which the figure sits is affixed permanently to the box. On the\r\n      top of this latter is a chess-board, also permanently affixed.\r\n      The right arm of the Chess-Player is extended at full length\r\n      before him, at right angles with his body, and lying, in an\r\n      apparently careless position, by the side of the board. The back\r\n      of the hand is upwards. The board itself is eighteen inches\r\n      square. The left arm of the figure is bent at the elbow, and in\r\n      the left hand is a pipe. A green drapery conceals the back of the\r\n      Turk, and falls partially over the front of both shoulders. To\r\n      judge from the external appearance of the box, it is divided into\r\n      five compartments—three cupboards of equal dimensions, and two\r\n      drawers occupying that portion of the chest lying beneath the\r\n      cupboards. The foregoing observations apply to the appearance of\r\n      the Automaton upon its first introduction into the presence of\r\n      the spectators.\r\n\r\n      Maelzel now informs the company that he will disclose to their\r\n      view the mechanism of the machine. Taking from his pocket a bunch\r\n      of keys he unlocks with one of them, door marked ~ in the cut\r\n      above, and throws the cupboard fully open to the inspection of\r\n      all present. Its whole interior is apparently filled with wheels,\r\n      pinions, levers, and other machinery, crowded very closely\r\n      together, so that the eye can penetrate but a little distance\r\n      into the mass. Leaving this door open to its full extent, he goes\r\n      now round to the back of the box, and raising the drapery of the\r\n      figure, opens another door situated precisely in the rear of the\r\n      one first opened. Holding a lighted candle at this door, and\r\n      shifting the position of the whole machine repeatedly at the same\r\n      time, a bright light is thrown entirely through the cupboard,\r\n      which is now clearly seen to be full, completely full, of\r\n      machinery. The spectators being satisfied of this fact, Maelzel\r\n      closes the back door, locks it, takes the key from the lock, lets\r\n      fall the drapery of the figure, and comes round to the front. The\r\n      door marked I, it will be remembered, is still open. The\r\n      exhibiter now proceeds to open the drawer which lies beneath the\r\n      cupboards at the bottom of the box—for although there are\r\n      apparently two drawers, there is really only one—the two handles\r\n      and two key holes being intended merely for ornament. Having\r\n      opened this drawer to its full extent, a small cushion, and a set\r\n      of chessmen, fixed in a frame work made to support them\r\n      perpendicularly, are discovered. Leaving this drawer, as well as\r\n      cupboard No. 1 open, Maelzel now unlocks door No. 2, and door No.\r\n      3, which are discovered to be folding doors, opening into one and\r\n      the same compartment. To the right of this compartment, however,\r\n      (that is to say the spectators’ right) a small division, six\r\n      inches wide, and filled with machinery, is partitioned off. The\r\n      main compartment itself (in speaking of that portion of the box\r\n      visible upon opening doors 2 and 3, we shall always call it the\r\n      main compartment) is lined with dark cloth and contains no\r\n      machinery whatever beyond two pieces of steel, quadrant-shaped,\r\n      and situated one in each of the rear top corners of the\r\n      compartment. A small protuberance about eight inches square, and\r\n      also covered with dark cloth, lies on the floor of the\r\n      compartment near the rear corner on the spectators’ left hand.\r\n      Leaving doors No. 2 and No. 3 open as well as the drawer, and\r\n      door No. I, the exhibiter now goes round to the back of the main\r\n      compartment, and, unlocking another door there, displays clearly\r\n      all the interior of the main compartment, by introducing a candle\r\n      behind it and within it. The whole box being thus apparently\r\n      disclosed to the scrutiny of the company, Maelzel, still leaving\r\n      the doors and drawer open, rolls the Automaton entirely round,\r\n      and exposes the back of the Turk by lifting up the drapery. A\r\n      door about ten inches square is thrown open in the loins of the\r\n      figure, and a smaller one also in the left thigh. The interior of\r\n      the figure, as seen through these apertures, appears to be\r\n      crowded with machinery. In general, every spectator is now\r\n      thoroughly satisfied of having beheld and completely scrutinized,\r\n      at one and the same time, every individual portion of the\r\n      Automaton, and the idea of any person being concealed in the\r\n      interior, during so complete an exhibition of that interior, if\r\n      ever entertained, is immediately dismissed as preposterous in the\r\n      extreme.\r\n\r\n      M. Maelzel, having rolled the machine back into its original\r\n      position, now informs the company that the Automaton will play a\r\n      game of chess with any one disposed to encounter him. This\r\n      challenge being accepted, a small table is prepared for the\r\n      antagonist, and placed close by the rope, but on the spectators’\r\n      side of it, and so situated as not to prevent the company from\r\n      obtaining a full view of the Automaton. From a drawer in this\r\n      table is taken a set of chess-men, and Maelzel arranges them\r\n      generally, but not always, with his own hands, on the chess\r\n      board, which consists merely of the usual number of squares\r\n      painted upon the table. The antagonist having taken his seat, the\r\n      exhibiter approaches the drawer of the box, and takes therefrom\r\n      the cushion, which, after removing the pipe from the hand of the\r\n      Automaton, he places under its left arm as a support. Then taking\r\n      also from the drawer the Automaton’s set of chess-men, he\r\n      arranges them upon the chessboard before the figure. He now\r\n      proceeds to close the doors and to lock them—leaving the bunch of\r\n      keys in door No. 1. He also closes the drawer, and, finally,\r\n      winds up the machine, by applying a key to an aperture in the\r\n      left end (the spectators’ left) of the box. The game now\r\n      commences—the Automaton taking the first move. The duration of\r\n      the contest is usually limited to half an hour, but if it be not\r\n      finished at the expiration of this period, and the antagonist\r\n      still contend that he can beat the Automaton, M. Maelzel has\r\n      seldom any objection to continue it. Not to weary the company, is\r\n      the ostensible, and no doubt the real object of the limitation.\r\n      It Wits of course be understood that when a move is made at his\r\n      own table, by the antagonist, the corresponding move is made at\r\n      the box of the Automaton, by Maelzel himself, who then acts as\r\n      the representative of the antagonist. On the other hand, when the\r\n      Turk moves, the corresponding move is made at the table of the\r\n      antagonist, also by M. Maelzel, who then acts as the\r\n      representative of the Automaton. In this manner it is necessary\r\n      that the exhibiter should often pass from one table to the other.\r\n      He also frequently goes in rear of the figure to remove the\r\n      chess-men which it has taken, and which it deposits, when taken,\r\n      on the box to the left (to its own left) of the board. When the\r\n      Automaton hesitates in relation to its move, the exhibiter is\r\n      occasionally seen to place himself very near its right side, and\r\n      to lay his hand, now and then, in a careless manner upon the box.\r\n      He has also a peculiar shuffle with his feet, calculated to\r\n      induce suspicion of collusion with the machine in minds which are\r\n      more cunning than sagacious. These peculiarities are, no doubt,\r\n      mere mannerisms of M. Maelzel, or, if he is aware of them at all,\r\n      he puts them in practice with a view of exciting in the\r\n      spectators a false idea of the pure mechanism in the Automaton.\r\n\r\n      The Turk plays with his left hand. All the movements of the arm\r\n      are at right angles. In this manner, the hand (which is gloved\r\n      and bent in a natural way,) being brought directly above the\r\n      piece to be moved, descends finally upon it, the fingers\r\n      receiving it, in most cases, without difficulty. Occasionally,\r\n      however, when the piece is not precisely in its proper situation,\r\n      the Automaton fails in his attempt at seizing it. When this\r\n      occurs, no second effort is made, but the arm continues its\r\n      movement in the direction originally intended, precisely as if\r\n      the piece were in the fingers. Having thus designated the spot\r\n      whither the move should have been made, the arm returns to its\r\n      cushion, and Maelzel performs the evolution which the Automaton\r\n      pointed out. At every movement of the figure machinery is heard\r\n      in motion. During the progress of the game, the figure now and\r\n      then rolls its eyes, as if surveying the board, moves its head,\r\n      and pronounces the word _echec _(check) when necessary. {*3} If a\r\n      false move be made by his antagonist, he raps briskly on the box\r\n      with the fingers of his right hand, shakes his head roughly, and\r\n      replacing the piece falsely moved, in its former situation,\r\n      assumes the next move himself. Upon beating the game, he waves\r\n      his head with an air of triumph, looks round complacently upon\r\n      the spectators, and drawing his left arm farther back than usual,\r\n      suffers his fingers alone to rest upon the cushion. In general,\r\n      the Turk is victorious—once or twice he has been beaten. The game\r\n      being ended, Maelzel will again if desired, exhibit the mechanism\r\n      of the box, in the same manner as before. The machine is then\r\n      rolled back, and a curtain hides it from the view of the company.\r\n\r\n      There have been many attempts at solving the mystery of the\r\n      Automaton. The most general opinion in relation to it, an opinion\r\n      too not unfrequently adopted by men who should have known better,\r\n      was, as we have before said, that no immediate human agency was\r\n      employed—in other words, that the machine was purely a machine\r\n      and nothing else. Many, however maintained that the exhibiter\r\n      himself regulated the movements of the figure by mechanical means\r\n      operating through the feet of the box. Others again, spoke\r\n      confidently of a magnet. Of the first of these opinions we shall\r\n      say nothing at present more than we have already said. In\r\n      relation to the second it is only necessary to repeat what we\r\n      have before stated, that the machine is rolled about on castors,\r\n      and will, at the request of a spectator, be moved to and fro to\r\n      any portion of the room, even during the progress of a game. The\r\n      supposition of the magnet is also untenable—for if a magnet were\r\n      the agent, any other magnet in the pocket of a spectator would\r\n      disarrange the entire mechanism. The exhibiter, however, will\r\n      suffer the most powerful loadstone to remain even upon the box\r\n      during the whole of the exhibition.\r\n\r\n      The first attempt at a written explanation of the secret, at\r\n      least the first attempt of which we ourselves have any knowledge,\r\n      was made in a large pamphlet printed at Paris in 1785. The\r\n      author’s hypothesis amounted to this—that a dwarf actuated the\r\n      machine. This dwarf he supposed to conceal himself during the\r\n      opening of the box by thrusting his legs into two hollow\r\n      cylinders, which were represented to be (but which are not) among\r\n      the machinery in the cupboard No. I, while his body was out of\r\n      the box entirely, and covered by the drapery of the Turk. When\r\n      the doors were shut, the dwarf was enabled to bring his body\r\n      within the box—the noise produced by some portion of the\r\n      machinery allowing him to do so unheard, and also to close the\r\n      door by which he entered. The interior of the automaton being\r\n      then exhibited, and no person discovered, the spectators, says\r\n      the author of this pamphlet, are satisfied that no one is within\r\n      any portion of the machine. This whole hypothesis was too\r\n      obviously absurd to require comment, or refutation, and\r\n      accordingly we find that it attracted very little attention.\r\n\r\n      In 1789 a book was published at Dresden by M. I. F. Freyhere in\r\n      which another endeavor was made to unravel the mystery. Mr.\r\n      Freyhere’s book was a pretty large one, and copiously illustrated\r\n      by colored engravings. His supposition was that “a well-taught\r\n      boy very thin and tall of his age (sufficiently so that he could\r\n      be concealed in a drawer almost immediately under the\r\n      chess-board”) played the game of chess and effected all the\r\n      evolutions of the Automaton. This idea, although even more silly\r\n      than that of the Parisian author, met with a better reception,\r\n      and was in some measure believed to be the true solution of the\r\n      wonder, until the inventor put an end to the discussion by\r\n      suffering a close examination of the top of the box.\r\n\r\n      These bizarre attempts at explanation were followed by others\r\n      equally bizarre. Of late years however, an anonymous writer, by a\r\n      course of reasoning exceedingly unphilosophical, has contrived to\r\n      blunder upon a plausible solution—although we cannot consider it\r\n      altogether the true one. His Essay was first published in a\r\n      Baltimore weekly paper, was illustrated by cuts, and was entitled\r\n      “An attempt to analyze the Automaton Chess-Player of M. Maelzel.”\r\n      This Essay we suppose to have been the original of the _pamphlet\r\n      to _which Sir David Brewster alludes in his letters on Natural\r\n      Magic, and which he has no hesitation in declaring a thorough and\r\n      satisfactory explanation. The _results _of the analysis are\r\n      undoubtedly, in the main, just; but we can only account for\r\n      Brewster’s pronouncing the Essay a thorough and satisfactory\r\n      explanation, by supposing him to have bestowed upon it a very\r\n      cursory and inattentive perusal. In the compendium of the Essay,\r\n      made use of in the Letters on Natural Magic, it is quite\r\n      impossible to arrive at any distinct conclusion in regard to the\r\n      adequacy or inadequacy of the analysis, on account of the gross\r\n      misarrangement and deficiency of the letters of reference\r\n      employed. The same fault is to be found in the “Attempt &c.,” as\r\n      we originally saw it. The solution consists in a series of minute\r\n      explanations, (accompanied by wood-cuts, the whole occupying many\r\n      pages) in which the object is to show the _possibility _of _so\r\n      shifting the partitions _of the box, as to allow a human being,\r\n      concealed in the interior, to move portions of his body from one\r\n      part of the box to another, during the exhibition of the\r\n      mechanism—thus eluding the scrutiny of the spectators. There can\r\n      be no doubt, as we have before observed, and as we will presently\r\n      endeavor to show, that the principle, or rather the result, of\r\n      this solution is the true one. Some person is concealed in the\r\n      box during the whole time of exhibiting the interior. We object,\r\n      however, to the whole verbose description of the _manner _in\r\n      which the partitions are shifted, to accommodate the movements of\r\n      the person concealed. We object to it as a mere theory assumed in\r\n      the first place, and to which circumstances are afterwards made\r\n      to adapt themselves. It was not, and could not have been, arrived\r\n      at by any inductive reasoning. In whatever way the shifting is\r\n      managed, it is of course concealed at every step from\r\n      observation. To show that certain movements might possibly be\r\n      effected in a certain way, is very far from showing that they are\r\n      actually so effected. There may be an infinity of other methods\r\n      by which the same results may be obtained. The probability of the\r\n      one assumed proving the correct one is then as unity to infinity.\r\n      But, in reality, this particular point, the shifting of the\r\n      partitions, is of no consequence whatever. It was altogether\r\n      unnecessary to devote seven or eight pages for the purpose of\r\n      proving what no one in his senses would deny—viz: that the\r\n      wonderful mechanical genius of Baron Kempelen could invent the\r\n      necessary means for shutting a door or slipping aside a pannel,\r\n      with a human agent too at his service in actual contact with the\r\n      pannel or the door, and the whole operations carried on, as the\r\n      author of the Essay himself shows, and as we shall attempt to\r\n      show more fully hereafter, entirely out of reach of the\r\n      observation of the spectators.\r\n\r\n      In attempting ourselves an explanation of the Automaton, we will,\r\n      in the first place, endeavor to show how its operations are\r\n      effected, and afterwards describe, as briefly as possible, the\r\n      nature of the _observations _from which we have deduced our\r\n      result.\r\n\r\n      It will be necessary for a proper understanding of the subject,\r\n      that we repeat here in a few words, the routine adopted by the\r\n      exhibiter in disclosing the interior of the box—a routine from\r\n      which he _never _deviates in any material particular. In the\r\n      first place he opens the door No. I. Leaving this open, he goes\r\n      round to the rear of the box, and opens a door precisely at the\r\n      back of door No. I. To this back door he holds a lighted candle.\r\n      He then _closes the back door, _locks it, and, coming round to\r\n      the front, opens the drawer to its full extent. This done, he\r\n      opens the doors No. 2 and No. 3, (the folding doors) and displays\r\n      the interior of the main compartment. Leaving open the main\r\n      compartment, the drawer, and the front door of cupboard No. I, he\r\n      now goes to the rear again, and throws open the back door of the\r\n      main compartment. In shutting up the box no particular order is\r\n      observed, except that the folding doors are always closed before\r\n      the drawer.\r\n\r\n      Now, let us suppose that when the machine is first rolled into\r\n      the presence of the spectators, a man is already within it. His\r\n      body is situated behind the dense machinery in cupboard No. T.\r\n      (the rear portion of which machinery is so contrived as to slip\r\n      _en masse, _from the main compartment to the cupboard No. I, as\r\n      occasion may require,) and his legs lie at full length in the\r\n      main compartment. When Maelzel opens the door No. I, the man\r\n      within is not in any danger of discovery, for the keenest eye\r\n      cannot penetrate more than about two inches into the darkness\r\n      within. But the case is otherwise when the back door of the\r\n      cupboard No. I, is opened. A bright light then pervades the\r\n      cupboard, and the body of the man would be discovered if it were\r\n      there. But it is not. The putting the key in the lock of the back\r\n      door was a signal on hearing which the person concealed brought\r\n      his body forward to an angle as acute as possible—throwing it\r\n      altogether, or nearly so, into the main compartment. This,\r\n      however, is a painful position, and cannot be long maintained.\r\n      Accordingly we find that Maelzel _closes the back door. _This\r\n      being done, there is no reason why the body of the man may not\r\n      resume its former situation—for the cupboard is again so dark as\r\n      to defy scrutiny. The drawer is now opened, and the legs of the\r\n      person within drop down behind it in the space it formerly\r\n      occupied. {*4} There is, consequently, now no longer any part of\r\n      the man in the main compartment—his body being behind the\r\n      machinery in cupboard No. 1, and his legs in the space occupied\r\n      by the drawer. The exhibiter, therefore, finds himself at liberty\r\n      to display the main compartment. This he does—opening both its\r\n      back and front doors—and no person Is discovered. The spectators\r\n      are now satisfied that the whole of the box is exposed to\r\n      view—and exposed too, all portions of it at one and the same\r\n      time. But of course this is not the case. They neither see the\r\n      space behind the drawer, nor the interior of cupboard No. 1—the\r\n      front door of which latter the exhibiter virtually shuts in\r\n      shutting its back door. Maelzel, having now rolled the machine\r\n      around, lifted up the drapery of the Turk, opened the doors in\r\n      his back and thigh, and shown his trunk to be full of machinery,\r\n      brings the whole back into its original position, and closes the\r\n      doors. The man within is now at liberty to move about. He gets up\r\n      into the body of the Turk just so high as to bring his eyes above\r\n      the level of the chess-board. It is very probable that he seats\r\n      himself upon the little square block or protuberance which is\r\n      seen in a corner of the main compartment when the doors are open.\r\n      In this position he sees the chess-board through the bosom of the\r\n      Turk which is of gauze. Bringing his right arm across his breast\r\n      he actuates the little machinery necessary to guide the left arm\r\n      and the fingers of the figure. This machinery is situated just\r\n      beneath the left shoulder of the Turk, and is consequently easily\r\n      reached by the right hand of the man concealed, if we suppose his\r\n      right arm brought across the breast. The motions of the head and\r\n      eyes, and of the right arm of the figure, as well as the sound\r\n      _echec _are produced by other mechanism in the interior, and\r\n      actuated at will by the man within. The whole of this\r\n      mechanism—that is to say all the mechanism essential to the\r\n      machine—is most probably contained within the little cupboard (of\r\n      about six inches in breadth) partitioned off at the right (the\r\n      spectators’ right) of the main compartment.\r\n\r\n      In this analysis of the operations of the Automaton, we have\r\n      purposely avoided any allusion to the manner in which the\r\n      partitions are shifted, and it will now be readily comprehended\r\n      that this point is a matter of no importance, since, by mechanism\r\n      within the ability of any common carpenter, it might be effected\r\n      in an infinity of different ways, and since we have shown that,\r\n      however performed, it is performed out of the view of the\r\n      spectators. Our result is founded upon the following\r\n      _observations _taken during frequent visits to the exhibition of\r\n      Maelzel. {*5}\r\n\r\n      I. The moves of the Turk are not made at regular intervals of\r\n      time, but accommodate themselves to the moves of the\r\n      antagonist—although this point (of regularity) so important in\r\n      all kinds of mechanical contrivance, might have been readily\r\n      brought about by limiting the time allowed for the moves of the\r\n      antagonist. For example, if this limit were three minutes, the\r\n      moves of the Automaton might be made at any given intervals\r\n      longer than three minutes. The fact then of irregularity, when\r\n      regularity might have been so easily attained, goes to prove that\r\n      regularity is unimportant to the action of the Automaton—in other\r\n      words, that the Automaton is not a _pure machine._\r\n\r\n      2. When the Automaton is about to move a piece, a distinct motion\r\n      is observable just beneath the left shoulder, and which motion\r\n      agitates in a slight degree, the drapery covering the front of\r\n      the left shoulder. This motion invariably precedes, by about two\r\n      seconds, the movement of the arm itself—and the arm never, in any\r\n      instance, moves without this preparatory motion in the shoulder.\r\n      Now let the antagonist move a piece, and let the corresponding\r\n      move be made by Maelzel, as usual, upon the board of the\r\n      Automaton. Then let the antagonist narrowly watch the Automaton,\r\n      until he detect the preparatory motion in the shoulder.\r\n      Immediately upon detecting this motion, and before the arm itself\r\n      begins to move, let him withdraw his piece, as if perceiving an\r\n      error in his manœuvre. It will then be seen that the movement of\r\n      the arm, which, in all other cases, immediately succeeds the\r\n      motion in the shoulder, is withheld—is not made—although Maelzel\r\n      has not yet performed, on the board of the Automaton, any move\r\n      corresponding to the withdrawal of the antagonist. In this case,\r\n      that the Automaton was about to move is evident—and that he did\r\n      not move, was an effect plainly produced by the withdrawal of the\r\n      antagonist, and without any intervention of Maelzel.\r\n\r\n      This fact fully proves, 1—that the intervention of Maelzel, in\r\n      performing the moves of the antagonist on the board of the\r\n      Automaton, is not essential to the movements of the Automaton,\r\n      2—that its movements are regulated by _mind—_by some person who\r\n      sees the board of the antagonist, 3—that its movements are not\r\n      regulated by the mind of Maelzel, whose back was turned towards\r\n      the antagonist at the withdrawal of his move.\r\n\r\n      3. The Automaton does not invariably win the game. Were the\r\n      machine a pure machine this would not be the case—it would always\r\n      win. The _principle _being discovered by which a machine can be\r\n      made to _play _a game of chess, an extension of the same\r\n      principle would enable it to win a game—a farther extension would\r\n      enable it to win _all _games—that is, to beat any possible game\r\n      of an antagonist. A little consideration will convince any one\r\n      that the difficulty of making a machine beat all games, Is not in\r\n      the least degree greater, as regards the principle of the\r\n      operations necessary, than that of making it beat a single game.\r\n      If then we regard the Chess-Player as a machine, we must suppose,\r\n      (what is highly improbable,) that its inventor preferred leaving\r\n      it incomplete to perfecting it—a supposition rendered still more\r\n      absurd, when we reflect that the leaving it incomplete would\r\n      afford an argument against the possibility of its being a pure\r\n      machine—the very argument we now adduce.\r\n\r\n      4. When the situation of the game is difficult or complex, we\r\n      never perceive the Turk either shake his head or roll his eyes.\r\n      It is only when his next move is obvious, or when the game is so\r\n      circumstanced that to a man in the Automaton’s place there would\r\n      be no necessity for reflection. Now these peculiar movements of\r\n      the head and eyes are movements customary with persons engaged in\r\n      meditation, and the ingenious Baron Kempelen would have adapted\r\n      these movements (were the machine a pure machine) to occasions\r\n      proper for their display—that is, to occasions of complexity. But\r\n      the reverse is seen to be the case, and this reverse applies\r\n      precisely to our supposition of a man in the interior. When\r\n      engaged in meditation about the game he has no time to think of\r\n      setting in motion the mechanism of the Automaton by which are\r\n      moved the head and the eyes. When the game, however, is obvious,\r\n      he has time to look about him, and, accordingly, we see the head\r\n      shake and the eyes roll.\r\n\r\n      5. When the machine is rolled round to allow the spectators an\r\n      examination of the back of the Turk, and when his drapery is\r\n      lifted up and the doors in the trunk and thigh thrown open, the\r\n      interior of the trunk is seen to be crowded with machinery. In\r\n      scrutinizing this machinery while the Automaton was in motion,\r\n      that is to say while the whole machine was moving on the castors,\r\n      it appeared to us that certain portions of the mechanism changed\r\n      their shape and position in a degree too great to be accounted\r\n      for by the simple laws of perspective; and subsequent\r\n      examinations convinced us that these undue alterations were\r\n      attributable to mirrors in the interior of the trunk. The\r\n      introduction of mirrors among the machinery could not have been\r\n      intended to influence, in any degree, the machinery itself. Their\r\n      operation, whatever that operation should prove to be, must\r\n      necessarily have reference to the eye of the spectator. We at\r\n      once concluded that these mirrors were so placed to multiply to\r\n      the vision some few pieces of machinery within the trunk so as to\r\n      give it the appearance of being crowded with mechanism. Now the\r\n      direct inference from this is that the machine is not a pure\r\n      machine. For if it were, the inventor, so far from wishing its\r\n      mechanism to appear complex, and using deception for the purpose\r\n      of giving it this appearance, would have been especially desirous\r\n      of convincing those who witnessed his exhibition, of the\r\n      _simplicity _of the means by which results so wonderful were\r\n      brought about.\r\n\r\n      6. The external appearance, and, especially, the deportment of\r\n      the Turk, are, when we consider them as imitations of _life, _but\r\n      very indifferent imitations. The countenance evinces no\r\n      ingenuity, and is surpassed, in its resemblance to the human\r\n      face, by the very commonest of wax-works. The eyes roll\r\n      unnaturally in the head, without any corresponding motions of the\r\n      lids or brows. The arm, particularly, performs its operations in\r\n      an exceedingly stiff, awkward, jerking, and rectangular manner.\r\n      Now, all this is the result either of inability in Maelzel to do\r\n      better, or of intentional neglect—accidental neglect being out of\r\n      the question, when we consider that the whole time of the\r\n      ingenious proprietor is occupied in the improvement of his\r\n      machines. Most assuredly we must not refer the unlife-like\r\n      appearances to inability—for all the rest of Maelzel’s automata\r\n      are evidence of his full ability to copy the motions and\r\n      peculiarities of life with the most wonderful exactitude. The\r\n      rope-dancers, for example, are inimitable. When the clown laughs,\r\n      his lips, his eyes, his eye-brows, and eyelids—indeed, all the\r\n      features of his countenance—are imbued with their appropriate\r\n      expressions. In both him and his companion, every gesture is so\r\n      entirely easy, and free from the semblance of artificiality,\r\n      that, were it not for the diminutiveness of their size, and the\r\n      fact of their being passed from one spectator to another previous\r\n      to their exhibition on the rope, it would be difficult to\r\n      convince any assemblage of persons that these wooden automata\r\n      were not living creatures. We cannot, therefore, doubt Mr.\r\n      Maelzel’s ability, and we must necessarily suppose that he\r\n      intentionally suffered his Chess Player to remain the same\r\n      artificial and unnatural figure which Baron Kempelen (no doubt\r\n      also through design) originally made it. What this design was it\r\n      is not difficult to conceive. Were the Automaton life-like in its\r\n      motions, the spectator would be more apt to attribute its\r\n      operations to their true cause, (that is, to human agency within)\r\n      than he is now, when the awkward and rectangular manœuvres convey\r\n      the idea of pure and unaided mechanism.\r\n\r\n      7. When, a short time previous to the commencement of the game,\r\n      the Automaton is wound up by the exhibiter as usual, an ear in\r\n      any degree accustomed to the sounds produced in winding up a\r\n      system of machinery, will not fail to discover, instantaneously,\r\n      that the axis turned by the key in the box of the Chess-Player,\r\n      cannot possibly be connected with either a weight, a spring, or\r\n      any system of machinery whatever. The inference here is the same\r\n      as in our last observation. The winding up is inessential to the\r\n      operations of the Automaton, and is performed with the design of\r\n      exciting in the spectators the false idea of mechanism.\r\n\r\n      8. When the question is demanded explicitly of Maelzel—“Is the\r\n      Automaton a pure machine or not?” his reply is invariably the\r\n      same—“I will say nothing about it.” Now the notoriety of the\r\n      Automaton, and the great curiosity it has every where excited,\r\n      are owing more especially to the prevalent opinion that it is a\r\n      pure machine, than to any other circumstance. Of course, then, it\r\n      is the interest of the proprietor to represent it as a pure\r\n      machine. And what more obvious, and more effectual method could\r\n      there be of impressing the spectators with this desired idea,\r\n      than a positive and explicit declaration to that effect? On the\r\n      other hand, what more obvious and effectual method could there be\r\n      of exciting a disbelief in the Automaton’s being a pure machine,\r\n      than by withholding such explicit declaration? For, people will\r\n      naturally reason thus,—It is Maelzel’s interest to represent this\r\n      thing a pure machine—he refuses to do so, directly, in words,\r\n      although he does not scruple, and is evidently anxious to do so,\r\n      indirectly by actions—were it actually what he wishes to\r\n      represent it by actions, he would gladly avail himself of the\r\n      more direct testimony of words—the inference is, that a\r\n      consciousness of its not being a pure machine, is the reason of\r\n      his silence—his actions cannot implicate him in a falsehood—his\r\n      words may.\r\n\r\n      9. When, in exhibiting the interior of the box, Maelzel has\r\n      thrown open the door No. I, and also the door immediately behind\r\n      it, he holds a lighted candle at the back door (as mentioned\r\n      above) and moves the entire machine to and fro with a view of\r\n      convincing the company that the cupboard No. 1 is entirely filled\r\n      with machinery. When the machine is thus moved about, it will be\r\n      apparent to any careful observer, that whereas that portion of\r\n      the machinery near the front door No. 1, is perfectly steady and\r\n      unwavering, the portion farther within fluctuates, in a very\r\n      slight degree, with the movements of the machine. This\r\n      circumstance first aroused in us the suspicion that the more\r\n      remote portion of the machinery was so arranged as to be easily\r\n      slipped, _en masse, _from its position when occasion should\r\n      require it. This occasion we have already stated to occur when\r\n      the man concealed within brings his body into an erect position\r\n      upon the closing of the back door.\r\n\r\n      10. Sir David Brewster states the figure of the Turk to be of the\r\n      size of life—but in fact it is far above the ordinary size.\r\n      Nothing is more easy than to err in our notions of magnitude. The\r\n      body of the Automaton is generally insulated, and, having no\r\n      means of immediately comparing it with any human form, we suffer\r\n      ourselves to consider it as of ordinary dimensions. This mistake\r\n      may, however, be corrected by observing the Chess-Player when, as\r\n      is sometimes the case, the exhibiter approaches it. Mr. Maelzel,\r\n      to be sure, is not very tall, but upon drawing near the machine,\r\n      his head will be found at least eighteen inches below the head of\r\n      the Turk, although the latter, it will be remembered, is in a\r\n      sitting position.\r\n\r\n      11. The box behind which the Automaton is placed, is precisely\r\n      three feet six inches long, two feet four inches deep, and two\r\n      feet six inches high. These dimensions are fully sufficient for\r\n      the accommodation of a man very much above the common size—and\r\n      the main compartment alone is capable of holding any ordinary man\r\n      in the position we have mentioned as assumed by the person\r\n      concealed. As these are facts, which any one who doubts them may\r\n      prove by actual calculation, we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon\r\n      them. We will only suggest that, although the top of the box is\r\n      apparently a board of about three inches in thickness, the\r\n      spectator may satisfy himself by stooping and looking up at it\r\n      when the main compartment is open, that it is in reality very\r\n      thin. The height of the drawer also will be misconceived by those\r\n      who examine it in a cursory manner. There is a space of about\r\n      three inches between the top of the drawer as seen from the\r\n      exterior, and the bottom of the cupboard—a space which must be\r\n      included in the height of the drawer. These contrivances to make\r\n      the room within the box appear less than it actually is, are\r\n      referrible to a design on the part of the inventor, to impress\r\n      the company again with a false idea, viz. that no human being can\r\n      be accommodated within the box.\r\n\r\n      12. The interior of the main compartment is lined throughout with\r\n      _cloth. _This cloth we suppose to have a twofold object. A\r\n      portion of _it _may form, when tightly stretched, the only\r\n      partitions which there is any necessity for removing during the\r\n      changes of the man’s position, viz: the partition between the\r\n      rear of the main compartment and the rear of the cupboard No. 1,\r\n      and the partition between the main compartment, and the space\r\n      behind the drawer when open. If we imagine this to be the case,\r\n      the difficulty of shifting the partitions vanishes at once, if\r\n      indeed any such difficulty could be supposed under any\r\n      circumstances to exist. The second object of the cloth is to\r\n      deaden and render indistinct all sounds occasioned by the\r\n      movements of the person within.\r\n\r\n      13. The antagonist (as we have before observed) is not suffered\r\n      to play at the board of the Automaton, but is seated at some\r\n      distance from the machine. The reason which, most probably, would\r\n      be assigned for this circumstance, if the question were demanded,\r\n      is, that were the antagonist otherwise situated, his person would\r\n      intervene between the machine and the spectators, and preclude\r\n      the latter from a distinct view. But this difficulty might be\r\n      easily obviated, either by elevating the seats of the company, or\r\n      by turning the end of the box towards them during the game. The\r\n      true cause of the restriction is, perhaps, very different. Were\r\n      the antagonist seated in contact with the box, the secret would\r\n      be liable to discovery, by his detecting, with the aid of a quick\r\n      car, the breathings of the man concealed.\r\n\r\n      14. Although M. Maelzel, in disclosing the interior of the\r\n      machine, sometimes slightly deviates from the _routine _which we\r\n      have pointed out, yet _reeler in _any instance does he _so\r\n      _deviate from it as to interfere with our solution. For example,\r\n      he has been known to open, first of all, the drawer—but he never\r\n      opens the main compartment without first closing the back door of\r\n      cupboard No. 1—he never opens the main compartment without first\r\n      pulling out the drawer—he never shuts the drawer without first\r\n      shutting the main compartment—he never opens the back door of\r\n      cupboard No. 1 while the main compartment is open—and the game of\r\n      chess is never commenced until the whole machine is closed. Now\r\n      if it were observed that _never, in any single instance, _did M.\r\n      Maelzel differ from the routine we have pointed out as necessary\r\n      to our solution, it would be one of the strongest possible\r\n      arguments in corroboration of it—but the argument becomes\r\n      infinitely strengthened if we duly consider the circumstance that\r\n      he _does occasionally _deviate from the routine but never does\r\n      _so _deviate as to falsify the solution.\r\n\r\n      15. There are six candles on the board of the Automaton during\r\n      exhibition. The question naturally arises—“Why are so many\r\n      employed, when a single candle, or, at farthest, two, would have\r\n      been amply sufficient to afford the spectators a clear view of\r\n      the board, in a room otherwise so well lit up as the exhibition\r\n      room always is—when, moreover, if we suppose the machine a _pure\r\n      machine, _there can be no necessity for so much light, or indeed\r\n      any light at all, to enable _it _to perform its operations—and\r\n      when, especially, only a single candle is placed upon the table\r\n      of the antagonist?” The first and most obvious inference is, that\r\n      so strong a light is requisite to enable the man within to see\r\n      through the transparent material (probably fine gauze) of which\r\n      the breast of the Turk is composed. But when we consider the\r\n      arrangement of the candles, another reason immediately presents\r\n      itself. There are six lights (as we have said before) in all.\r\n      Three of these are on each side of the figure. Those most remote\r\n      from the spectators are the longest—those in the middle are about\r\n      two inches shorter—and those nearest the company about two inches\r\n      shorter still—and the candles on one side differ in height from\r\n      the candles respectively opposite on the other, by a ratio\r\n      different from two inches—that is to say, the longest candle on\r\n      one side is about three inches shorter than the longest candle on\r\n      the other, and so on. Thus it will be seen that no two of the\r\n      candles are of the same height, and thus also the difficulty of\r\n      ascertaining the _material _of the breast of the figure (against\r\n      which the light is especially directed) is greatly augmented by\r\n      the dazzling effect of the complicated crossings of the\r\n      rays—crossings which are brought about by placing the centres of\r\n      radiation all upon different levels.\r\n\r\n      16. While the Chess-Player was in possession of Baron Kempelen,\r\n      it was more than once observed, first, that an Italian in the\r\n      suite of the Baron was never visible during the playing of a game\r\n      at chess by the Turk, and, secondly, that the Italian being taken\r\n      seriously ill, the exhibition was suspended until his recovery.\r\n      This Italian professed a _total _ignorance of the game of chess,\r\n      although all others of the suite played well. Similar\r\n      observations have been made since the Automaton has been\r\n      purchased by Maelzel. There is a man, _Schlumberoer, _who attends\r\n      him wherever he goes, but who has no ostensible occupation other\r\n      than that of assisting in the packing and unpacking of the\r\n      automata. This man is about the medium size, and has a remarkable\r\n      stoop in the shoulders. Whether he professes to play chess or\r\n      not, we are not informed. It is quite certain, however, that he\r\n      is never to be seen during the exhibition of the Chess-Player,\r\n      although frequently visible just before and just after the\r\n      exhibition. Moreover, some years ago Maelzel visited Richmond\r\n      with his automata, and exhibited them, we believe, in the house\r\n      now occupied by M. Bossieux as a Dancing Academy. _Schlumberg_er\r\n      was suddenly taken ill, and during his illness there was no\r\n      exhibition of the Chess-Player. These facts are well known to\r\n      many of our citizens. The reason assigned for the suspension of\r\n      the Chess-Player’s performances, was _not _the illness of\r\n      _Schlumberger. _The inferences from all this we leave, without\r\n      farther comment, to the reader.\r\n\r\n      17. The Turk plays with his _left_ arm. A circumstance so\r\n      remarkable cannot be accidental. Brewster takes no notice of it\r\n      whatever beyond a mere statement, we believe, that such is the\r\n      fact. The early writers of treatises on the Automaton, seem not\r\n      to have observed the matter at all, and have no reference to it.\r\n      The author of the pamphlet alluded to by Brewster, mentions it,\r\n      but acknowledges his inability to account for it. Yet it is\r\n      obviously from such prominent discrepancies or incongruities as\r\n      this that deductions are to be made (if made at all) which shall\r\n      lead us to the truth.\r\n\r\n      The circumstance of the Automaton’s playing with his left hand\r\n      cannot have connexion with the operations of the machine,\r\n      considered merely as such. Any mechanical arrangement which would\r\n      cause the figure to move, in any given manner, the left\r\n      arm—could, if reversed, cause it to move, in the same manner, the\r\n      right. But these principles cannot be extended to the human\r\n      organization, wherein there is a marked and radical difference in\r\n      the construction, and, at all events, in the powers, of the right\r\n      and left arms. Reflecting upon this latter fact, we naturally\r\n      refer the incongruity noticeable in the Chess-Player to this\r\n      peculiarity in the human organization. If so, we must imagine\r\n      some _reversion—_for the Chess-Player plays precisely as a man\r\n      _would not. _These ideas, once entertained, are sufficient of\r\n      themselves, to suggest the notion of a man in the interior. A few\r\n      more imperceptible steps lead us, finally, to the result. The\r\n      Automaton plays with his left arm, because under no other\r\n      circumstances could the man within play with his right—a\r\n      _desideratum _of course. Let us, for example, imagine the\r\n      Automaton to play with his right arm. To reach the machinery\r\n      which moves the arm, and which we have before explained to lie\r\n      just beneath the shoulder, it would be necessary for the man\r\n      within either to use his right arm in an exceedingly painful and\r\n      awkward position, (viz. brought up close to his body and tightly\r\n      compressed between his body and the side of the Automaton,) or\r\n      else to use his left arm brought across his breast. In neither\r\n      case could he act with the requisite ease or precision. On the\r\n      contrary, the Automaton playing, as it actually does, with the\r\n      left arm, all difficulties vanish. The right arm of the man\r\n      within is brought across his breast, and his right fingers act,\r\n      without any constraint, upon the machinery in the shoulder of the\r\n      figure.\r\n\r\n      We do not believe that any reasonable objections can be urged\r\n      against this solution of the Automaton Chess-Player.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POWER OF WORDS\r\n\r\n\r\n      OINOS. Pardon, Agathos, the weakness of a spirit new-fledged with\r\n      immortality!\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. You have spoken nothing, my Oinos, for which pardon is\r\n      to be demanded. Not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition.\r\n      For wisdom, ask of the angels freely, that it may be given!\r\n\r\n      OINOS. But in this existence, I dreamed that I should be at once\r\n      cognizant of all things, and thus at once be happy in being\r\n      cognizant of all.\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the\r\n      acquisition of knowledge! In for ever knowing, we are for ever\r\n      blessed; but to know all were the curse of a fiend.\r\n\r\n      OINOS. But does not The Most High know all?\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. That (since he is The Most Happy) must be still the one\r\n      thing unknown even to Him.\r\n\r\n      OINOS. But, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not at last\r\n      all things be known?\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. Look down into the abysmal distances!—attempt to force\r\n      the gaze down the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep\r\n      slowly through them thus—and thus—and thus! Even the spiritual\r\n      vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden\r\n      walls of the universe?—the walls of the myriads of the shining\r\n      bodies that mere number has appeared to blend into unity?\r\n\r\n      OINOS. I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no\r\n      dream.\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. There are _no_ dreams in Aidenn—but it is here whispered\r\n      that, of this infinity of matter, the _sole_ purpose is to afford\r\n      infinite springs, at which the soul may allay the thirst _to\r\n      know_, which is for ever unquenchable within it—since to quench\r\n      it, would be to extinguish the soul’s self. Question me then, my\r\n      Oinos, freely and without fear. Come! we will leave to the left\r\n      the loud harmony of the Pleiades, and swoop outward from the\r\n      throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion, where, for pansies\r\n      and violets, and heart’s-ease, are the beds of the triplicate and\r\n      triple-tinted suns.\r\n\r\n      OINOS. And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!—speak to me\r\n      in the earth’s familiar tones. I understand not what you hinted\r\n      to me, just now, of the modes or of the method of what, during\r\n      mortality, we were accustomed to call Creation. Do you mean to\r\n      say that the Creator is not God?\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. I mean to say that the Deity does not create.\r\n\r\n      OINOS. Explain.\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. In the beginning only, he created. The seeming creatures\r\n      which are now, throughout the universe, so perpetually springing\r\n      into being, can only be considered as the mediate or indirect,\r\n      not as the direct or immediate results of the Divine creative\r\n      power.\r\n\r\n      OINOS. Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be considered\r\n      heretical in the extreme.\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. Among angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be simply true.\r\n\r\n      OINOS. I can comprehend you thus far—that certain operations of\r\n      what we term Nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain\r\n      conditions, give rise to that which has all the _appearance_ of\r\n      creation. Shortly before the final overthrow of the earth, there\r\n      were, I well remember, many very successful experiments in what\r\n      some philosophers were weak enough to denominate the creation of\r\n      animalculæ.\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. The cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of\r\n      the secondary creation—and of the only species of creation which\r\n      has ever been, since the first word spoke into existence the\r\n      first law.\r\n\r\n      OINOS. Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of\r\n      nonentity, burst hourly forth into the heavens—are not these\r\n      stars, Agathos, the immediate handiwork of the King?\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you, step by step, to\r\n      the conception I intend. You are well aware that, as no thought\r\n      can perish, so no act is without infinite result. We moved our\r\n      hands, for example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and, in\r\n      so doing, gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it.\r\n      This vibration was indefinitely extended, till it gave impulse to\r\n      every particle of the earth’s air, which thenceforward, and for\r\n      ever, was actuated by the one movement of the hand. This fact the\r\n      mathematicians of our globe well knew. They made the special\r\n      effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid by special impulses, the\r\n      subject of exact calculation—so that it became easy to determine\r\n      in what precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle\r\n      the orb, and impress (for ever) every atom of the atmosphere\r\n      circumambient. Retrograding, they found no difficulty, from a\r\n      given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of\r\n      the original impulse. Now the mathematicians who saw that the\r\n      results of any given impulse were absolutely endless—and who saw\r\n      that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through\r\n      the agency of algebraic analysis—who saw, too, the facility of\r\n      the retrogradation—these men saw, at the same time, that this\r\n      species of analysis itself, had within itself a capacity for\r\n      indefinite progress—that there were no bounds conceivable to its\r\n      advancement and applicability, except within the intellect of him\r\n      who advanced or applied it. But at this point our mathematicians\r\n      paused.\r\n\r\n      OINOS. And why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. Because there were some considerations of deep interest\r\n      beyond. It was deducible from what they knew, that to a being of\r\n      infinite understanding—one to whom the perfection of the\r\n      algebraic analysis lay unfolded—there could be no difficulty in\r\n      tracing every impulse given the air—and the ether through the\r\n      air—to the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote\r\n      epoch of time. It is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse\r\n      given the air, must, in the end, impress every individual thing\r\n      that exists within the universe;—and the being of infinite\r\n      understanding—the being whom we have imagined—might trace the\r\n      remote undulations of the impulse—trace them upward and onward in\r\n      their influences upon all particles of an matter—upward and\r\n      onward for ever in their modifications of old forms—or, in other\r\n      words, in their creation of new—until he found them\r\n      reflected—unimpressive at last—back from the throne of the\r\n      Godhead. And not only could such a thing do this, but at any\r\n      epoch, should a given result be afforded him—should one of these\r\n      numberless comets, for example, be presented to his inspection—he\r\n      could have no difficulty in determining, by the analytic\r\n      retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. This power\r\n      of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection—this\r\n      faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all causes—is\r\n      of course the prerogative of the Deity alone—but in every variety\r\n      of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power itself\r\n      exercised by the whole host of the Angelic intelligences.\r\n\r\n      OINOS. But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. In speaking of the air, I referred only to the earth;\r\n      but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the\r\n      ether—which, since it pervades, and alone pervades all space, is\r\n      thus the great medium of creation.\r\n\r\n      OINOS. Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. It must: but a true philosophy has long taught that the\r\n      source of all motion is thought—and the source of all thought is—\r\n\r\n      OINOS. God.\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child of the fair\r\n      Earth which lately perished—of impulses upon the atmosphere of\r\n      the Earth.\r\n\r\n      OINOS. You did.\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. And while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind\r\n      some thought of the physical power of words? Is not every word an\r\n      impulse on the air?\r\n\r\n      OINOS. But why, Agathos, do you weep—and why, oh why do your\r\n      wings droop as we hover above this fair star—which is the\r\n      greenest and yet most terrible of all we have encountered in our\r\n      flight? Its brilliant flowers look like a fairy dream—but its\r\n      fierce volcanoes like the passions of a turbulent heart.\r\n\r\n      AGATHOS. They are!—they are! This wild star—it is now three\r\n      centuries since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at\r\n      the feet of my beloved—I spoke it—with a few passionate\r\n      sentences—into birth. Its brilliant flowers are the dearest of\r\n      all unfulfilled dreams, and its raging volcanoes are the passions\r\n      of the most turbulent and unhallowed of hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLLOQUY OF MONOS AND UNA\r\n\r\n\r\nΜελλοντα ταυτα.—SOPHOCLES—_Antig._\r\n     “These things are in the near future.”\r\n\r\n      _ Una._ “Born again?”\r\n\r\n      _ Monos._ Yes, fairest and best beloved Una, “born again.” These\r\n      were the words upon whose mystical meaning I had so long\r\n      pondered, rejecting the explanations of the priesthood, until\r\n      Death himself resolved for me the secret.\r\n\r\n      _Una._ Death!\r\n\r\n      _Monos._ How strangely, sweet Una, you echo my words! I observe,\r\n      too, a vacillation in your step—a joyous inquietude in your eyes.\r\n      You are confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the\r\n      Life Eternal. Yes, it was of Death I spoke. And here how\r\n      singularly sounds that word which of old was wont to bring terror\r\n      to all hearts—throwing a mildew upon all pleasures!\r\n\r\n      _Una._ Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all feasts! How\r\n      often, Monos, did we lose ourselves in speculations upon its\r\n      nature! How mysteriously did it act as a check to human\r\n      bliss—saying unto it “thus far, and no farther!” That earnest\r\n      mutual love, my own Monos, which burned within our bosoms—how\r\n      vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy in its first\r\n      up-springing, that our happiness would strengthen with its\r\n      strength! Alas! as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of\r\n      that evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever! Thus,\r\n      in time, it became painful to love. Hate would have been mercy\r\n      then.\r\n\r\n      _Monos._ Speak not here of these griefs, dear Una—mine, mine,\r\n      forever now!\r\n\r\n      _ Una._ But the memory of past sorrow—is it not present joy? I\r\n      have much to say yet of the things which have been. Above all, I\r\n      burn to know the incidents of your own passage through the dark\r\n      Valley and Shadow.\r\n\r\n      _ Monos._ And when did the radiant Una ask anything of her Monos\r\n      in vain? I will be minute in relating all—but at what point shall\r\n      the weird narrative begin?\r\n\r\n      _Una._ At what point?\r\n\r\n      _Monos._ You have said.\r\n\r\n      _Una._ Monos, I comprehend you. In Death we have both learned the\r\n      propensity of man to define the indefinable. I will not say,\r\n      then, commence with the moment of life’s cessation—but commence\r\n      with that sad, sad instant when, the fever having abandoned you,\r\n      you sank into a breathless and motionless torpor, and I pressed\r\n      down your pallid eyelids with the passionate fingers of love.\r\n\r\n      _ Monos._ One word first, my Una, in regard to man’s general\r\n      condition at this epoch. You will remember that one or two of the\r\n      wise among our forefathers—wise in fact, although not in the\r\n      world’s esteem—had ventured to doubt the propriety of the term\r\n      “improvement,” as applied to the progress of our civilization.\r\n      There were periods in each of the five or six centuries\r\n      immediately preceding our dissolution, when arose some vigorous\r\n      intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose truth\r\n      appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly\r\n      obvious—principles which should have taught our race to submit to\r\n      the guidance of the natural laws, rather than attempt their\r\n      control. At long intervals some masterminds appeared, looking\r\n      upon each advance in practical science as a retro-gradation in\r\n      the true utility. Occasionally the poetic intellect—that\r\n      intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of\r\n      all—since those truths which to us were of the most enduring\r\n      importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in\r\n      proof tones to the imagination alone and to the unaided reason\r\n      bears no weight—occasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a\r\n      step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the\r\n      philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the\r\n      tree of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a\r\n      distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the\r\n      infant condition of his soul. And these men—the poets—living and\r\n      perishing amid the scorn of the “utilitarians”—of rough pedants,\r\n      who arrogated to themselves a title which could have been\r\n      properly applied only to the scorned—these men, the poets,\r\n      pondered piningly, yet not unwisely, upon the ancient days when\r\n      our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keen—days\r\n      when mirth was a word unknown, so solemnly deep-toned was\r\n      happiness—holy, august and blissful days, when blue rivers ran\r\n      undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest solitudes,\r\n      primæval, odorous, and unexplored.\r\n\r\n      Yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule served but to\r\n      strengthen it by opposition. Alas! we had fallen upon the most\r\n      evil of all our evil days. The great “movement”—that was the cant\r\n      term—went on: a diseased commotion, moral and physical. Art—the\r\n      Arts—arose supreme, and, once enthroned, cast chains upon the\r\n      intellect which had elevated them to power. Man, because he could\r\n      not but acknowledge the majesty of Nature, fell into childish\r\n      exultation at his acquired and still-increasing dominion over her\r\n      elements. Even while he stalked a God in his own fancy, an\r\n      infantine imbecility came over him. As might be supposed from the\r\n      origin of his disorder, he grew infected with system, and with\r\n      abstraction. He enwrapped himself in generalities. Among other\r\n      odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground; and in the\r\n      face of analogy and of God—in despite of the loud warning voice\r\n      of the laws of _gradation_ so visibly pervading all things in\r\n      Earth and Heaven—wild attempts at an omni-prevalent Democracy\r\n      were made. Yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading\r\n      evil—Knowledge. Man could not both know and succumb. Meantime\r\n      huge smoking cities arose, innumerable. Green leaves shrank\r\n      before the hot breath of furnaces. The fair face of Nature was\r\n      deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome disease. And\r\n      methinks, sweet Una, even our slumbering sense of the forced and\r\n      of the far-fetched might have arrested us here. But now it\r\n      appears that we had worked out our own destruction in the\r\n      perversion of our taste, or rather in the blind neglect of its\r\n      culture in the schools. For, in truth, it was at this crisis that\r\n      taste alone—that faculty which, holding a middle position between\r\n      the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely have\r\n      been disregarded—it was now that taste alone could have led us\r\n      gently back to Beauty, to Nature, and to Life. But alas for the\r\n      pure contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of Plato! Alas\r\n      for the μουσικη which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient\r\n      education for the soul! Alas for him and for it!—since both were\r\n      most desperately needed when both were most entirely forgotten or\r\n      despised. {*1}\r\n\r\n      Pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how\r\n      truly!—“que tout notre raisonnement se rèduit à céder au\r\n      sentiment;” and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the\r\n      natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old\r\n      ascendancy over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools. But\r\n      this thing was not to be. Prematurely induced by intemperance of\r\n      knowledge the old age of the world drew on. This the mass of\r\n      mankind saw not, or, living lustily although unhappily, affected\r\n      not to see. But, for myself, the Earth’s records had taught me to\r\n      look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization. I had\r\n      imbibed a prescience of our Fate from comparison of China the\r\n      simple and enduring, with Assyria the architect, with Egypt the\r\n      astrologer, with Nubia, more crafty than either, the turbulent\r\n      mother of all Arts. In history {*2} of these regions I met with a\r\n      ray from the Future. The individual artificialities of the three\r\n      latter were local diseases of the Earth, and in their individual\r\n      overthrows we had seen local remedies applied; but for the\r\n      infected world at large I could anticipate no regeneration save\r\n      in death. That man, as a race, should not become extinct, I saw\r\n      that he must be “born again.”\r\n\r\n      And now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,\r\n      daily, in dreams. Now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of\r\n      the days to come, when the Art-scarred surface of the Earth,\r\n      having undergone that purification {*3} which alone could efface\r\n      its rectangular obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the\r\n      verdure and the mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of\r\n      Paradise, and be rendered at length a fit dwelling-place for\r\n      man:—for man the Death purged—for man to whose now exalted\r\n      intellect there should be poison in knowledge no more—for the\r\n      redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal, but still for\r\n      the material, man.\r\n\r\n      _Una._ Well do I remember these conversations, dear Monos; but\r\n      the epoch of the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we\r\n      believed, and as the corruption you indicate did surely warrant\r\n      us in believing. Men lived; and died individually. You yourself\r\n      sickened, and passed into the grave; and thither your constant\r\n      Una speedily followed you. And though the century which has since\r\n      elapsed, and whose conclusion brings us thus together once more,\r\n      tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience of duration,\r\n      yet, my Monos, it was a century still.\r\n\r\n      _Monos._ Say, rather, a point in the vague infinity.\r\n      Unquestionably, it was in the Earth’s dotage that I died. Wearied\r\n      at heart with anxieties which had their origin in the general\r\n      turmoil and decay, I succumbed to the fierce fever. After some\r\n      few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium replete with\r\n      ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for pain, while\r\n      I longed but was impotent to undeceive you—after some days there\r\n      came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless\r\n      torpor; and this was termed Death by those who stood around me.\r\n\r\n      Words are vague things. My condition did not deprive me of\r\n      sentience. It appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the\r\n      extreme quiescence of him, who, having slumbered long and\r\n      profoundly, lying motionless and fully prostrate in a midsummer\r\n      noon, begins to steal slowly back into consciousness, through the\r\n      mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without being awakened by\r\n      external disturbances.\r\n\r\n      I breathed no longer. The pulses were still. The heart had ceased\r\n      to beat. Volition had not departed, but was powerless. The senses\r\n      were unusually active, although eccentrically so—assuming often\r\n      each other’s functions at random. The taste and the smell were\r\n      inextricably confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and\r\n      intense. The rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened\r\n      my lips to the last, affected me with sweet fancies of\r\n      flowers—fantastic flowers, far more lovely than any of the old\r\n      Earth, but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us. The\r\n      eyelids, transparent and bloodless, offered no complete\r\n      impediment to vision. As volition was in abeyance, the balls\r\n      could not roll in their sockets but all objects within the range\r\n      of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less\r\n      distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or\r\n      into the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than\r\n      those which struck the front or interior surface. Yet, in the\r\n      former instance, this effect was so far anomalous that I\r\n      appreciated it only as sound—sound sweet or discordant as the\r\n      matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in\r\n      shade—curved or angular in outline. The hearing, at the same\r\n      time, although excited in degree, was not irregular in\r\n      action—estimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision,\r\n      not less than of sensibility. Touch had undergone a modification\r\n      more peculiar. Its impressions were tardily received, but\r\n      pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the highest\r\n      physical pleasure. Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon\r\n      my eyelids, at first only recognised through vision, at length,\r\n      long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual\r\n      delight immeasurable. I say with a sensual delight. All my\r\n      perceptions were purely sensual. The materials furnished the\r\n      passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree wrought\r\n      into shape by the deceased understanding. Of pain there was some\r\n      little; of pleasure there was much; but of moral pain or pleasure\r\n      none at all. Thus your wild sobs floated into my ear with all\r\n      their mournful cadences, and were appreciated in their every\r\n      variation of sad tone; but they were soft musical sounds and no\r\n      more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the\r\n      sorrows which gave them birth; while the large and constant tears\r\n      which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a heart which\r\n      broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone. And\r\n      this was in truth the Death of which these bystanders spoke\r\n      reverently, in low whispers—you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with loud\r\n      cries.\r\n\r\n      They attired me for the coffin—three or four dark figures which\r\n      flitted busily to and fro. As these crossed the direct line of my\r\n      vision they affected me as forms; but upon passing to my side\r\n      their images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and\r\n      other dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of wo. You\r\n      alone, habited in a white robe, passed in all directions\r\n      musically about me.\r\n\r\n      The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed\r\n      by a vague uneasiness—an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when\r\n      sad real sounds fall continuously within his ear—low distant\r\n      bell-tones, solemn, at long but equal intervals, and mingling\r\n      with melancholy dreams. Night arrived; and with its shadows a\r\n      heavy discomfort. It oppressed my limbs with the oppression of\r\n      some dull weight, and was palpable. There was also a moaning\r\n      sound, not unlike the distant reverberation of surf, but more\r\n      continuous, which, beginning with the first twilight, had grown\r\n      in strength with the darkness. Suddenly lights were brought into\r\n      the room, and this reverberation became forthwith interrupted\r\n      into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound, but less dreary\r\n      and less distinct. The ponderous oppression was in a great\r\n      measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp, (for\r\n      there were many,) there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain\r\n      of melodious monotone. And when now, dear Una, approaching the\r\n      bed upon which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side,\r\n      breathing odor from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my\r\n      brow, there arose tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with\r\n      the merely physical sensations which circumstances had called\r\n      forth, a something akin to sentiment itself—a feeling that, half\r\n      appreciating, half responded to your earnest love and sorrow; but\r\n      this feeling took no root in the pulseless heart, and seemed\r\n      indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and faded quickly away,\r\n      first into extreme quiescence, and then into a purely sensual\r\n      pleasure as before.\r\n\r\n      And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there\r\n      appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect. In its\r\n      exercise I found a wild delight—yet a delight still physical,\r\n      inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part. Motion in the\r\n      animal frame had fully ceased. No muscle quivered; no nerve\r\n      thrilled; no artery throbbed. But there seemed to have sprung up\r\n      in the brain, that of which no words could convey to the merely\r\n      human intelligence even an indistinct conception. Let me term it\r\n      a mental pendulous pulsation. It was the moral embodiment of\r\n      man’s abstract idea of Time. By the absolute equalization of this\r\n      movement—or of such as this—had the cycles of the firmamental\r\n      orbs themselves, been adjusted. By its aid I measured the\r\n      irregularities of the clock upon the mantel, and of the watches\r\n      of the attendants. Their tickings came sonorously to my ears. The\r\n      slightest deviations from the true proportion—and these\r\n      deviations were omni-prevalent—affected me just as violations of\r\n      abstract truth were wont, on earth, to affect the moral sense.\r\n      Although no two of the time-pieces in the chamber struck the\r\n      individual seconds accurately together, yet I had no difficulty\r\n      in holding steadily in mind the tones, and the respective\r\n      momentary errors of each. And this—this keen, perfect,\r\n      self-existing sentiment of duration—this sentiment existing (as\r\n      man could not possibly have conceived it to exist) independently\r\n      of any succession of events—this idea—this sixth sense,\r\n      upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first obvious and\r\n      certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of the\r\n      temporal Eternity.\r\n\r\n      It was midnight; and you still sat by my side. All others had\r\n      departed from the chamber of Death. They had deposited me in the\r\n      coffin. The lamps burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the\r\n      tremulousness of the monotonous strains. But, suddenly these\r\n      strains diminished in distinctness and in volume. Finally they\r\n      ceased. The perfume in my nostrils died away. Forms affected my\r\n      vision no longer. The oppression of the Darkness uplifted itself\r\n      from my bosom. A dull shock like that of electricity pervaded my\r\n      frame, and was followed by total loss of the idea of contact. All\r\n      of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole consciousness\r\n      of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of duration. The\r\n      mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the\r\n      deadly Decay.\r\n\r\n      Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and\r\n      the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a\r\n      lethargic intuition. I appreciated the direful change now in\r\n      operation upon the flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware\r\n      of the bodily presence of one who leans over him, so, sweet Una,\r\n      I still dully felt that you sat by my side. So, too, when the\r\n      noon of the second day came, I was not unconscious of those\r\n      movements which displaced you from my side, which confined me\r\n      within the coffin, which deposited me within the hearse, which\r\n      bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which heaped\r\n      heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness\r\n      and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.\r\n\r\n      And here, in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose,\r\n      there rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul watched\r\n      narrowly each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record\r\n      of its flight—without effort and without object.\r\n\r\n      A year passed. The consciousness of being had grown hourly more\r\n      indistinct, and that of mere locality had, in great measure,\r\n      usurped its position. The idea of entity was becoming merged in\r\n      that of place. The narrow space immediately surrounding what had\r\n      been the body, was now growing to be the body itself. At length,\r\n      as often happens to the sleeper (by sleep and its world alone is\r\n      Death imaged)—at length, as sometimes happened on Earth to the\r\n      deep slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into\r\n      awaking, yet left him half enveloped in dreams—so to me, in the\r\n      strict embrace of the Shadow came that light which alone might\r\n      have had power to startle—the light of enduring Love. Men toiled\r\n      at the grave in which I lay darkling. They upthrew the damp\r\n      earth. Upon my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of\r\n      Una.\r\n\r\n      And now again all was void. That nebulous light had been\r\n      extinguished. That feeble thrill had vibrated itself into\r\n      quiescence. Many lustra had supervened. Dust had returned to\r\n      dust. The worm had food no more. The sense of being had at length\r\n      utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead—instead of all\r\n      things—dominant and perpetual—the autocrats Place and Time. For\r\n      that which was not—for that which had no form—for that which had\r\n      no thought—for that which had no sentience—for that which was\r\n      soulless, yet of which matter formed no portion—for all this\r\n      nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the grave was still a\r\n      home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONVERSATION OF EIROS AND CHARMION\r\n\r\n\r\nΠυρ σοι προσοισω.\r\n     I will bring fire to thee.\r\n                    —EURIPIDES—_Androm._\r\n\r\n      EIROS.\r\n      Why do you call me Eiros?\r\n\r\n      CHARMION.\r\n      So henceforward will you always be called. You must forget too,\r\n      my earthly name, and speak to me as Charmion.\r\n\r\n      EIROS.\r\n      This is indeed no dream!\r\n\r\n      CHARMION.\r\n      Dreams are with us no more; but of these mysteries anon. I\r\n      rejoice to see you looking life-like and rational. The film of\r\n      the shadow has already passed from off your eyes. Be of heart and\r\n      fear nothing. Your allotted days of stupor have expired and,\r\n      to-morrow, I will myself induct you into the full joys and\r\n      wonders of your novel existence.\r\n\r\n      EIROS.\r\n      True—I feel no stupor—none at all. The wild sickness and the\r\n      terrible darkness have left me, and I hear no longer that mad,\r\n      rushing, horrible sound, like the “voice of many waters.” Yet my\r\n      senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the keenness of their\r\n      perception of the new.\r\n\r\n      CHARMION.\r\n      A few days will remove all this;—but I fully understand you, and\r\n      feel for you. It is now ten earthly years since I underwent what\r\n      you undergo—yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still. You have\r\n      now suffered all of pain, however, which you will suffer in\r\n      Aidenn.\r\n\r\n      EIROS.\r\n      In Aidenn?\r\n\r\n      CHARMION.\r\n      In Aidenn.\r\n\r\n      EIROS.\r\n      Oh God!—pity me, Charmion!—I am overburthened with the majesty of\r\n      all things—of the unknown now known—of the speculative Future\r\n      merged in the august and certain Present.\r\n\r\n      CHARMION.\r\n      Grapple not now with such thoughts. To-morrow we will speak of\r\n      this. Your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the\r\n      exercise of simple memories. Look not around, nor forward—but\r\n      back. I am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that\r\n      stupendous event which threw you among us. Tell me of it. Let us\r\n      converse of familiar things, in the old familiar language of the\r\n      world which has so fearfully perished.\r\n\r\n      EIROS.\r\n      Most fearfully, fearfully!—this is indeed no dream.\r\n\r\n      CHARMION.\r\n      Dreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Eiros?\r\n\r\n      EIROS.\r\n      Mourned, Charmion?—oh deeply. To that last hour of all, there\r\n      hung a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your\r\n      household.\r\n\r\n      CHARMION.\r\n      And that last hour—speak of it. Remember that, beyond the naked\r\n      fact of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing. When, coming out\r\n      from among mankind, I passed into Night through the Grave—at that\r\n      period, if I remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you\r\n      was utterly unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew little of the\r\n      speculative philosophy of the day.\r\n\r\n      EIROS.\r\n      The individual calamity was as you say entirely unanticipated;\r\n      but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion\r\n      with astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even\r\n      when you left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in\r\n      the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of\r\n      all things by fire, as having reference to the orb of the earth\r\n      alone. But in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin,\r\n      speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical\r\n      knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of\r\n      flame. The very moderate density of these bodies had been well\r\n      established. They had been observed to pass among the satellites\r\n      of Jupiter, without bringing about any sensible alteration either\r\n      in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We had\r\n      long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable\r\n      tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our\r\n      substantial globe, even in the event of contact. But contact was\r\n      not in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets\r\n      were accurately known. That among them we should look for the\r\n      agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many\r\n      years considered an inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild\r\n      fancies had been, of late days, strangely rife among mankind;\r\n      and, although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual\r\n      apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement by astronomers of a\r\n      new comet, yet this announcement was generally received with I\r\n      know not what of agitation and mistrust.\r\n\r\n      The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and\r\n      it was at once conceded by all observers, that its path, at\r\n      perihelion, would bring it into very close proximity with the\r\n      earth. There were two or three astronomers, of secondary note,\r\n      who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable. I cannot\r\n      very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the\r\n      people. For a few short days they would not believe an assertion\r\n      which their intellect so long employed among worldly\r\n      considerations could not in any manner grasp. But the truth of a\r\n      vitally important fact soon makes its way into the understanding\r\n      of even the most stolid. Finally, all men saw that astronomical\r\n      knowledge lied not, and they awaited the comet. Its approach was\r\n      not, at first, seemingly rapid; nor was its appearance of very\r\n      unusual character. It was of a dull red, and had little\r\n      perceptible train. For seven or eight days we saw no material\r\n      increase in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration\r\n      in its color. Meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were\r\n      discarded and all interests absorbed in a growing discussion,\r\n      instituted by the philosophic, in respect to the cometary nature.\r\n      Even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to\r\n      such considerations. The learned now gave their intellect—their\r\n      soul—to no such points as the allaying of fear, or to the\r\n      sustenance of loved theory. They sought—they panted for right\r\n      views. They groaned for perfected knowledge. Truth arose in the\r\n      purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise bowed\r\n      down and adored.\r\n\r\n      That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would\r\n      result from the apprehended contact, was an opinion which hourly\r\n      lost ground among the wise; and the wise were now freely\r\n      permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd. It was\r\n      demonstrated, that the density of the comet’s nucleus was far\r\n      less than that of our rarest gas; and the harmless passage of a\r\n      similar visitor among the satellites of Jupiter was a point\r\n      strongly insisted upon, and which served greatly to allay terror.\r\n      Theologists with an earnestness fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the\r\n      biblical prophecies, and expounded them to the people with a\r\n      directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been\r\n      known. That the final destruction of the earth must be brought\r\n      about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that\r\n      enforced every where conviction; and that the comets were of no\r\n      fiery nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved\r\n      all, in a great measure, from the apprehension of the great\r\n      calamity foretold. It is noticeable that the popular prejudices\r\n      and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and wars—errors which\r\n      were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet—were now\r\n      altogether unknown. As if by some sudden convulsive exertion,\r\n      reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne. The\r\n      feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive interest.\r\n\r\n      What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of\r\n      elaborate question. The learned spoke of slight geological\r\n      disturbances, of probable alterations in climate, and\r\n      consequently in vegetation, of possible magnetic and electric\r\n      influences. Many held that no visible or perceptible effect would\r\n      in any manner be produced. While such discussions were going on,\r\n      their subject gradually approached, growing larger in apparent\r\n      diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. Mankind grew paler as\r\n      it came. All human operations were suspended.\r\n\r\n      There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when\r\n      the comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any\r\n      previously recorded visitation. The people now, dismissing any\r\n      lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all\r\n      the certainty of evil. The chimerical aspect of their terror was\r\n      gone. The hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently\r\n      within their bosoms. A very few days sufficed, however, to merge\r\n      even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable We could no\r\n      longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts. Its\r\n      historical attributes had disappeared. It oppressed us with a\r\n      hideous novelty of emotion. We saw it not as an astronomical\r\n      phenomenon in the heavens, but as an incubus upon our hearts, and\r\n      a shadow upon our brains. It had taken, with inconceivable\r\n      rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame,\r\n      extending from horizon to horizon.\r\n\r\n      Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear\r\n      that we were already within the influence of the comet; yet we\r\n      lived. We even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity\r\n      of mind. The exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was\r\n      apparent; for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through\r\n      it. Meantime, our vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we\r\n      gained faith, from this predicted circumstance, in the foresight\r\n      of the wise. A wild luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown\r\n      before, burst out upon every vegetable thing.\r\n\r\n      Yet another day—and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was\r\n      now evident that its nucleus would first reach us. A wild change\r\n      had come over all men; and the first sense of pain was the wild\r\n      signal for general lamentation and horror. This first sense of\r\n      pain lay in a rigorous constriction of the breast and lungs, and\r\n      an insufferable dryness of the skin. It could not be denied that\r\n      our atmosphere was radically affected; the conformation of this\r\n      atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be\r\n      subjected, were now the topics of discussion. The result of\r\n      investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror\r\n      through the universal heart of man.\r\n\r\n      It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a\r\n      compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of\r\n      twenty-one measures of oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen in\r\n      every one hundred of the atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the\r\n      principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely\r\n      necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most\r\n      powerful and energetic agent in nature. Nitrogen, on the\r\n      contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life or\r\n      flame. An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been\r\n      ascertained in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we\r\n      had latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of\r\n      the idea, which had engendered awe. What would be the result of a\r\n      total extraction of the nitrogen? A combustion irresistible,\r\n      all-devouring, omni-prevalent, immediate;—the entire fulfilment,\r\n      in all their minute and terrible details, of the fiery and\r\n      horror-inspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy\r\n      Book.\r\n\r\n      Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of\r\n      mankind? That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired\r\n      us with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In\r\n      its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the\r\n      consummation of Fate. Meantime a day again passed—bearing away\r\n      with it the last shadow of Hope. We gasped in the rapid\r\n      modification of the air. The red blood bounded tumultuously\r\n      through its strict channels. A furious delirium possessed all\r\n      men; and, with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening\r\n      heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus of the\r\n      destroyer was now upon us; even here in Aidenn, I shudder while I\r\n      speak. Let me be brief—brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a\r\n      moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and\r\n      penetrating all things. Then—let us bow down, Charmion, before\r\n      the excessive majesty of the great God!—then, there came a\r\n      shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth itself of HIM;\r\n      while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed,\r\n      burst at once into a species of intense flame, for whose\r\n      surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels in the\r\n      high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name. Thus ended all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHADOW—A PARABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nYea, though I walk through the valley of the _Shadow._\r\n                    —_Psalm of David_.\r\n\r\n      Ye who read are still among the living; but I who write shall\r\n      have long since gone my way into the region of shadows. For\r\n      indeed strange things shall happen, and secret things be known,\r\n      and many centuries shall pass away, ere these memorials be seen\r\n      of men. And, when seen, there will be some to disbelieve, and\r\n      some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in\r\n      the characters here graven with a stylus of iron.\r\n\r\n      The year had been a year of terror, and of feelings more intense\r\n      than terror for which there is no name upon the earth. For many\r\n      prodigies and signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea\r\n      and land, the black wings of the Pestilence were spread abroad.\r\n      To those, nevertheless, cunning in the stars, it was not unknown\r\n      that the heavens wore an aspect of ill; and to me, the Greek\r\n      Oinos, among others, it was evident that now had arrived the\r\n      alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth year when, at\r\n      the entrance of Aries, the planet Jupiter is conjoined with the\r\n      red ring of the terrible Saturnus. The peculiar spirit of the\r\n      skies, if I mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only\r\n      in the physical orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations,\r\n      and meditations of mankind.\r\n\r\n      Over some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a\r\n      noble hall, in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a\r\n      company of seven. And to our chamber there was no entrance save\r\n      by a lofty door of brass: and the door was fashioned by the\r\n      artisan Corinnos, and, being of rare workmanship, was fastened\r\n      from within. Black draperies, likewise, in the gloomy room, shut\r\n      out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and the peopleless\r\n      streets—but the boding and the memory of Evil, they would not be\r\n      so excluded. There were things around us and about of which I can\r\n      render no distinct account—things material and\r\n      spiritual—heaviness in the atmosphere—a sense of\r\n      suffocation—anxiety—and, above all, that terrible state of\r\n      existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly\r\n      living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of thought lie\r\n      dormant. A dead weight hung upon us. It hung upon our limbs—upon\r\n      the household furniture—upon the goblets from which we drank; and\r\n      all things were depressed, and borne down thereby—all things save\r\n      only the flames of the seven lamps which illumined our revel.\r\n      Uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus\r\n      remained burning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror\r\n      which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which\r\n      we sat, each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own\r\n      countenance, and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his\r\n      companions. Yet we laughed and were merry in our proper way—which\r\n      was hysterical; and sang the songs of Anacreon—which are madness;\r\n      and drank deeply—although the purple wine reminded us of blood.\r\n      For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of\r\n      young Zoilus. Dead, and at full length he lay, enshrouded; the\r\n      genius and the demon of the scene. Alas! he bore no portion in\r\n      our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the plague,\r\n      and his eyes, in which Death had but half extinguished the fire\r\n      of the pestilence, seemed to take such interest in our merriment\r\n      as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to\r\n      die. But although I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed\r\n      were upon me, still I forced myself not to perceive the\r\n      bitterness of their expression, and gazing down steadily into the\r\n      depths of the ebony mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice\r\n      the songs of the son of Teios. But gradually my songs they\r\n      ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar off among the sable\r\n      draperies of the chamber, became weak, and undistinguishable, and\r\n      so faded away. And lo! from among those sable draperies where the\r\n      sounds of the song departed, there came forth a dark and\r\n      undefined shadow—a shadow such as the moon, when low in heaven,\r\n      might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow\r\n      neither of man nor of God, nor of any familiar thing. And\r\n      quivering awhile among the draperies of the room, it at length\r\n      rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass. But\r\n      the shadow was vague, and formless, and indefinite, and was the\r\n      shadow neither of man nor of God—neither God of Greece, nor God\r\n      of Chaldaea, nor any Egyptian God. And the shadow rested upon the\r\n      brazen doorway, and under the arch of the entablature of the\r\n      door, and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there became\r\n      stationary and remained. And the door whereupon the shadow rested\r\n      was, if I remember aright, over against the feet of the young\r\n      Zoilus enshrouded. But we, the seven there assembled, having seen\r\n      the shadow as it came out from among the draperies, dared not\r\n      steadily behold it, but cast down our eyes, and gazed continually\r\n      into the depths of the mirror of ebony. And at length I, Oinos,\r\n      speaking some low words, demanded of the shadow its dwelling and\r\n      its appellation. And the shadow answered, “I am SHADOW, and my\r\n      dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and hard by those\r\n      dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foul Charonian\r\n      canal.” And then did we, the seven, start from our seats in\r\n      horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast, for the\r\n      tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one\r\n      being, but of a multitude of beings, and, varying in their\r\n      cadences from syllable to syllable fell duskly upon our ears in\r\n      the well-remembered and familiar accents of many thousand\r\n      departed friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, Volume 4, by Edgar Allan Poe\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WORKS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE, VOL. 4 ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2150-0.txt or 2150-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/5/2150/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.

Yet as it lies some distance from any of the\n      main roads, being in a somewhat out-of-the-way situation, there\n      are perhaps very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit.\n      For the benefit of those who have not, therefore, it will be only\n      proper that I should enter into some account of it. And this is\n      indeed the more necessary, as with the hope of enlisting public\n      sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants, I design here to give a\n      history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred","within its limits. No one who knows me will doubt that the duty\n      thus self-imposed will be executed to the best of my ability,\n      with all that rigid impartiality, all that cautious examination\n      into facts, and diligent collation of authorities, which should\n      ever distinguish him who aspires to the title of historian.\n\n      By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscriptions, I am\n      enabled to say, positively, that the borough of\n      Vondervotteimittiss has existed, from its origin, in precisely\r\nthe same condition which it at present preserves. Of the date of\n      this origin, however, I grieve that I can only speak with that\n      species of indefinite definiteness which mathematicians are, at\n      times, forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae. The\n      date, I may thus say, in regard to the remoteness of its\n      antiquity, cannot be less than any assignable quantity\n      whatsoever.\n\n      Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittiss, I\n      confess myself, with sorrow, equally at fault. Among a multitude\r\nof opinions upon this delicate point—some acute, some learned,\n      some sufficiently the reverse—I am able to select nothing which\n      ought to be considered satisfactory. Perhaps the idea of\n      Grogswigg—nearly coincident with that of Kroutaplenttey—is to be\n      cautiously preferred.—It runs:—“Vondervotteimittis—Vonder, lege\n      Donder—Votteimittis, quasi und Bleitziz—Bleitziz obsol:—pro\n      Blitzen.” This derivative, to say the truth, is still\n      countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the\n      summit of the steeple of the House of the Town-Council. I do not\r\nchoose, however, to commit myself on a theme of such importance,\n      and must refer the reader desirous of information to the\n      “Oratiunculae de Rebus Praeter-Veteris,” of Dundergutz. See,\n      also, Blunderbuzzard “De Derivationibus,” pp. 27 to 5010, Folio,\n      Gothic edit., Red and Black character, Catch-word and No Cypher;\n      wherein consult, also, marginal notes in the autograph of\n      Stuffundpuff, with the Sub-Commentaries of Gruntundguzzell.\n\n      Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the","foundation of Vondervotteimittis, and the derivation of its name,\n      there can be no doubt, as I said before, that it has always\n      existed as we find it at this epoch. The oldest man in the\n      borough can remember not the slightest difference in the\n      appearance of any portion of it; and, indeed, the very suggestion\n      of such a possibility is considered an insult. The site of the\n      village is in a perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of a\n      mile in circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills,\r\nover whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass. For\n      this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe\n      there is anything at all on the other side.\n\n      Round the skirts of the valley (which is quite level, and paved\n      throughout with flat tiles), extends a continuous row of sixty\n      little houses. These, having their backs on the hills, must look,\n      of course, to the centre of the plain, which is just sixty yards\n      from the front door of each dwelling. Every house has a small\n      garden before it, with a circular path, a sun-dial, and\r\ntwenty-four cabbages. The buildings themselves are so precisely\n      alike, that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other.\n      Owing to the vast antiquity, the style of architecture is\n      somewhat odd, but it is not for that reason the less strikingly\n      picturesque. They are fashioned of hard-burned little bricks,\n      red, with black ends, so that the walls look like a chess-board\n      upon a great scale. The gables are turned to the front, and there\n      are cornices, as big as all the rest of the house, over the eaves\r\nand over the main doors. The windows are narrow and deep, with\n      very tiny panes and a great deal of sash. On the roof is a vast\n      quantity of tiles with long curly ears. The woodwork, throughout,\n      is of a dark hue and there is much carving about it, with but a\n      trifling variety of pattern for, time out of mind, the carvers of\n      Vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two\n      objects—a time-piece and a cabbage. But these they do exceedingly\n      well, and intersperse them, with singular ingenuity, wherever","they find room for the chisel.\n\n      The dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the furniture\n      is all upon one plan. The floors are of square tiles, the chairs\n      and tables of black-looking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy\n      feet. The mantelpieces are wide and high, and have not only\n      time-pieces and cabbages sculptured over the front, but a real\n      time-piece, which makes a prodigious ticking, on the top in the\n      middle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on each\r\nextremity by way of outrider. Between each cabbage and the\n      time-piece, again, is a little China man having a large stomach\n      with a great round hole in it, through which is seen the\n      dial-plate of a watch.\n\n      The fireplaces are large and deep, with fierce crooked-looking\n      fire-dogs. There is constantly a rousing fire, and a huge pot\n      over it, full of sauer-kraut and pork, to which the good woman of\n      the house is always busy in attending. She is a little fat old\n      lady, with blue eyes and a red face, and wears a huge cap like a\r\nsugar-loaf, ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons. Her dress\n      is of orange-colored linsey-woolsey, made very full behind and\n      very short in the waist—and indeed very short in other respects,\n      not reaching below the middle of her leg. This is somewhat thick,\n      and so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair of green stockings\n      to cover them. Her shoes—of pink leather—are fastened each with a\n      bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage. In\n      her left hand she has a little heavy Dutch watch; in her right\r\nshe wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork. By her side there\n      stands a fat tabby cat, with a gilt toy-repeater tied to its\n      tail, which “the boys” have there fastened by way of a quiz.\n\n      The boys themselves are, all three of them, in the garden\n      attending the pig. They are each two feet in height. They have\n      three-cornered cocked hats, purple waistcoats reaching down to\n      their thighs, buckskin knee-breeches, red stockings, heavy shoes\n      with big silver buckles, long surtout coats with large buttons of","mother-of-pearl. Each, too, has a pipe in his mouth, and a little\n      dumpy watch in his right hand. He takes a puff and a look, and\n      then a look and a puff. The pig—which is corpulent and lazy—is\n      occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the\n      cabbages, and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater,\n      which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him\n      look as handsome as the cat.\n\n      Right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bottomed armed\n      chair, with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables, is\r\nseated the old man of the house himself. He is an exceedingly\n      puffy little old gentleman, with big circular eyes and a huge\n      double chin. His dress resembles that of the boys—and I need say\n      nothing farther about it. All the difference is, that his pipe is\n      somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke. Like\n      them, he has a watch, but he carries his watch in his pocket. To\n      say the truth, he has something of more importance than a watch\n      to attend to—and what that is, I shall presently explain. He sits\r\nwith his right leg upon his left knee, wears a grave countenance,\n      and always keeps one of his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon\n      a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain.\n\n      This object is situated in the steeple of the House of the Town\n      Council. The Town Council are all very little, round, oily,\n      intelligent men, with big saucer eyes and fat double chins, and\n      have their coats much longer and their shoe-buckles much bigger\n      than the ordinary inhabitants of Vondervotteimittiss. Since my\r\nsojourn in the borough, they have had several special meetings,\n      and have adopted these three important resolutions:\n\n      “That it is wrong to alter the good old course of things:”\n\n      “That there is nothing tolerable out of Vondervotteimittiss:”\n      and—\n\n      “That we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages.”\n\n      Above the session-room of the Council is the steeple, and in the\n      steeple is the belfry, where exists, and has existed time out of\n      mind, the pride and wonder of the village—the great clock of the","borough of Vondervotteimittiss. And this is the object to which\n      the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the\n      leather-bottomed arm-chairs.\n\n      The great clock has seven faces—one in each of the seven sides of\n      the steeple—so that it can be readily seen from all quarters. Its\n      faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black. There\n      is a belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty\n      is the most perfect of sinecures—for the clock of\n      Vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the\r\nmatter with it. Until lately, the bare supposition of such a\n      thing was considered heretical. From the remotest period of\n      antiquity to which the archives have reference, the hours have\n      been regularly struck by the big bell. And, indeed the case was\n      just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the\n      borough. Never was such a place for keeping the true time. When\n      the large clapper thought proper to say “Twelve o’clock!” all its\n      obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously, and\r\nresponded like a very echo. In short, the good burghers were fond\n      of their sauer-kraut, but then they were proud of their clocks.\n\n      All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less\n      respect, and as the belfry—man of Vondervotteimittiss has the\n      most perfect of sinecures, he is the most perfectly respected of\n      any man in the world. He is the chief dignitary of the borough,\n      and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence.\n      His coat-tail is very far longer—his pipe, his shoe-buckles, his\r\neyes, and his stomach, very far bigger—than those of any other\n      old gentleman in the village; and as to his chin, it is not only\n      double, but triple.\n\n      I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteimittiss:\n      alas, that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse!\n\n      There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants, that\n      “no good can come from over the hills”; and it really seemed that\n      the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy. It","wanted five minutes of noon, on the day before yesterday, when\n      there appeared a very odd-looking object on the summit of the\n      ridge of the eastward. Such an occurrence, of course, attracted\n      universal attention, and every little old gentleman who sat in a\n      leather-bottomed arm-chair turned one of his eyes with a stare of\n      dismay upon the phenomenon, still keeping the other upon the\n      clock in the steeple.\n\n      By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon, the droll\n      object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive\r\nforeign-looking young man. He descended the hills at a great\n      rate, so that every body had soon a good look at him. He was\n      really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen\n      in Vondervotteimittiss. His countenance was of a dark\n      snuff-color, and he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide\n      mouth, and an excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed\n      anxious of displaying, as he was grinning from ear to ear. What\n      with mustachios and whiskers, there was none of the rest of his\r\nface to be seen. His head was uncovered, and his hair neatly done\n      up in papillotes. His dress was a tight-fitting swallow-tailed\n      black coat (from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of\n      white handkerchief), black kerseymere knee-breeches, black\n      stockings, and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black\n      satin ribbon for bows. Under one arm he carried a huge\n      _chapeau-de-bras_, and under the other a fiddle nearly five times\n      as big as himself. In his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from\n      which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of\r\nfantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the\n      greatest possible self-satisfaction. God bless me!—here was a\n      sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss!\n\n      To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an\n      audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he curvetted right\n      into the village, the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited\n      no little suspicion; and many a burgher who beheld him that day\n      would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric","handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his\n      swallow-tailed coat. But what mainly occasioned a righteous\n      indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he cut a\n      fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem to have the\n      remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his\n      steps.\n\n      The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance, however, to\n      get their eyes thoroughly open, when, just as it wanted half a\n      minute of noon, the rascal bounced, as I say, right into the\r\nmidst of them; gave a _chassez_ here, and a _balancez_ there; and\n      then, after a _pirouette_ and a _pas-de-zephyr_, pigeon-winged\n      himself right up into the belfry of the House of the Town\n      Council, where the wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a\n      state of dignity and dismay. But the little chap seized him at\n      once by the nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big\n      _chapeau-de-bras_ upon his head; knocked it down over his eyes\n      and mouth; and then, lifting up the big fiddle, beat him with it\r\nso long and so soundly, that what with the belfry-man being so\n      fat, and the fiddle being so hollow, you would have sworn that\n      there was a regiment of double-bass drummers all beating the\n      devil’s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of\n      Vondervotteimittiss.\n\n      There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this\n      unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for\n      the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon.\n      The bell was about to strike, and it was a matter of absolute and\r\npre-eminent necessity that every body should look well at his\n      watch. It was evident, however, that just at this moment the\n      fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business\n      to do with the clock. But as it now began to strike, nobody had\n      any time to attend to his manœuvres, for they had all to count\n      the strokes of the bell as it sounded.\n\n      “One!” said the clock.\n\n      “Von!” echoed every little old gentleman in every\n      leather-bottomed arm-chair in Vondervotteimittiss. “Von!” said","his watch also; “von!” said the watch of his vrow; and “von!”\n      said the watches of the boys, and the little gilt repeaters on\n      the tails of the cat and pig.\n\n      “Two!” continued the big bell; and\n\n      “Doo!” repeated all the repeaters.\n\n      “Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!” said the bell.\n\n      “Dree! Vour! Fibe! Sax! Seben! Aight! Noin! Den!” answered the\n      others.\n\n      “Eleven!” said the big one.\n\n      “Eleben!” assented the little ones.\n\n      “Twelve!” said the bell.\r\n“Dvelf!” they replied perfectly satisfied, and dropping their\n      voices.\n\n      “Und dvelf it is!” said all the little old gentlemen, putting up\n      their watches. But the big bell had not done with them yet.\n\n      “Thirteen!” said he.\n\n      “Der Teufel!” gasped the little old gentlemen, turning pale,\n      dropping their pipes, and putting down all their right legs from\n      over their left knees.\n\n      “Der Teufel!” groaned they, “Dirteen! Dirteen!!—Mein Gott, it is\n      Dirteen o’clock!!”\n\n      Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued? All\r\nVondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of\n      uproar.\n\n      “Vot is cum’d to mein pelly?” roared all the boys—“I’ve been\n      ongry for dis hour!”\n\n      “Vot is com’d to mein kraut?” screamed all the vrows, “It has\n      been done to rags for this hour!”\n\n      “Vot is cum’d to mein pipe?” swore all the little old gentlemen,\n      “Donder and Blitzen; it has been smoked out for dis hour!”—and\n      they filled them up again in a great rage, and sinking back in\n      their arm-chairs, puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the\r\nwhole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke.\n\n      Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face, and it\n      seemed as if old Nick himself had taken possession of every thing\n      in the shape of a timepiece. The clocks carved upon the furniture\n      took to dancing as if bewitched, while those upon the\n      mantel-pieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury, and\n      kept such a continual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking\n      and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see.","But, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could put up\n      any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to\n      their tails, and resented it by scampering all over the place,\n      scratching and poking, and squeaking and screeching, and\n      caterwauling and squalling, and flying into the faces, and\n      running under the petticoats of the people, and creating\n      altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is\n      possible for a reasonable person to conceive. And to make matters\n      still more distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the\r\nsteeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost. Every now\n      and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the\n      smoke. There he sat in the belfry upon the belfry-man, who was\n      lying flat upon his back. In his teeth the villain held the\n      bell-rope, which he kept jerking about with his head, raising\n      such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it. On\n      his lap lay the big fiddle, at which he was scraping, out of all\n      time and tune, with both hands, making a great show, the\r\nnincompoop! of playing “Judy O’Flannagan and Paddy O’Rafferty.”\n\n      Affairs being thus miserably situated, I left the place in\n      disgust, and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and\n      fine kraut. Let us proceed in a body to the borough, and restore\n      the ancient order of things in Vondervotteimittiss by ejecting\n      that little fellow from the steeple.\n\n\n\n\nLIONIZING\n\n\n     —— all people went\n     Upon their ten toes in wild wonderment.\n                    —_Bishop Hall’s Satires_.\n\n      I am—that is to say I was—a great man; but I am neither the\r\nauthor of Junius nor the man in the mask; for my name, I believe,\n      is Robert Jones, and I was born somewhere in the city of\n      Fum-Fudge.\n\n      The first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with\n      both hands. My mother saw this and called me a genius—my father\n      wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on Nosology. This I\n      mastered before I was breeched.\n\n      I now began to feel my way in the science, and soon came to\n      understand that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently","conspicuous, he might, by merely following it, arrive at a\n      Lionship. But my attention was not confined to theories alone.\n      Every morning I gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed\n      a half dozen of drams.\n\n      When I came of age my father asked me, one day, if I would step\n      with him into his study.\n\n      “My son,” said he, when we were seated, “what is the chief end of\n      your existence?”\n\n      “My father,” I answered, “it is the study of Nosology.”\n\n      “And what, Robert,” he inquired, “is Nosology?”\n\n      “Sir,” I said, “it is the science of Noses.”\r\n“And can you tell me,” he demanded, “what is the meaning of a\n      nose?”\n\n      “A nose, my father;” I replied, greatly softened, “has been\n      variously defined by about a thousand different authors.” [Here I\n      pulled out my watch.] “It is now noon or thereabouts—we shall\n      have time enough to get through with them all before midnight. To\n      commence then:—The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that\n      protuberance—that bump—that excrescence—that—”\n\n      “Will do, Robert,” interrupted the good old gentleman. “I am\r\nthunderstruck at the extent of your information—I am\n      positively—upon my soul.” [Here he closed his eyes and placed his\n      hand upon his heart.] “Come here!” [Here he took me by the arm.]\n      “Your education may now be considered as finished—it is high time\n      you should scuffle for yourself—and you cannot do a better thing\n      than merely follow your nose—so—so—so—” [Here he kicked me\n      downstairs and out of the door.]—“so get out of my house, and God\n      bless you!”\n\n      As I felt within me the divine afflatus, I considered this\r\naccident rather fortunate than otherwise. I resolved to be guided\n      by the paternal advice. I determined to follow my nose. I gave it\n      a pull or two upon the spot, and wrote a pamphlet on Nosology\n      forthwith.\n\n      All Fum-Fudge was in an uproar.\n\n      “Wonderful genius!” said the Quarterly.\n\n      “Superb physiologist!” said the Westminster.\n\n      “Clever fellow!” said the Foreign.\n\n      “Fine writer!” said the Edinburgh.\n\n      “Profound thinker!” said the Dublin.\n\n      “Great man!” said Bentley.","“Divine soul!” said Fraser.\n\n      “One of us!” said Blackwood.\n\n      “Who can he be?” said Mrs. Bas-Bleu.\n\n      “What can he be?” said big Miss Bas-Bleu.\n\n      “Where can he be?” said little Miss Bas-Bleu.—But I paid these\n      people no attention whatever—I just stepped into the shop of an\n      artist.\n\n      The Duchess of Bless-my-Soul was sitting for her portrait; the\n      Marquis of So-and-So was holding the Duchess’ poodle; the Earl of\n      This-and-That was flirting with her salts; and his Royal Highness\r\nof Touch-me-Not was leaning upon the back of her chair.\n\n      I approached the artist and turned up my nose.\n\n      “Oh, beautiful!” sighed her Grace.\n\n      “Oh my!” lisped the Marquis.\n\n      “Oh, shocking!” groaned the Earl.\n\n      “Oh, abominable!” growled his Royal Highness.\n\n      “What will you take for it?” asked the artist.\n\n      “For his nose!” shouted her Grace.\n\n      “A thousand pounds,” said I, sitting down.\n\n      “A thousand pounds?” inquired the artist, musingly.\n\n      “A thousand pounds,” said I.\n\n      “Beautiful!” said he, entranced.\r\n“A thousand pounds,” said I.\n\n      “Do you warrant it?” he asked, turning the nose to the light.\n\n      “I do,” said I, blowing it well.\n\n      “Is it quite original?” he inquired; touching it with reverence.\n\n      “Humph!” said I, twisting it to one side.\n\n      “Has no copy been taken?” he demanded, surveying it through a\n      microscope.\n\n      “None,” said I, turning it up.\n\n      “Admirable!” he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the\n      beauty of the manœuvre.\n\n      “A thousand pounds,” said I.\n\n      “A thousand pounds?” said he.\r\n“Precisely,” said I.\n\n      “A thousand pounds?” said he.\n\n      “Just so,” said I.\n\n      “You shall have them,” said he. “What a piece of virtu!” So he\n      drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch of my nose. I\n      engaged rooms in Jermyn street, and sent her Majesty the\n      ninety-ninth edition of the “Nosology,” with a portrait of the\n      proboscis.—That sad little rake, the Prince of Wales, invited me\n      to dinner.\n\n      We were all lions and _recherchés_.\n\n      There was a modern Platonist. He quoted Porphyry, Iamblicus,","Plotinus, Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius, and Syrianus.\n\n      There was a human-perfectibility man. He quoted Turgôt, Price,\n      Priestly, Condorcêt, De Staël, and the “Ambitious Student in Ill\n      Health.”\n\n      There was Sir Positive Paradox. He observed that all fools were\n      philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools.\n\n      There was Æstheticus Ethix. He spoke of fire, unity, and atoms;\n      bi-part and pre-existent soul; affinity and discord; primitive\n      intelligence and homoömeria.\n\n      There was Theologos Theology. He talked of Eusebius and Arianus;\r\nheresy and the Council of Nice; Puseyism and consubstantialism;\n      Homousios and Homouioisios.\n\n      There was Fricassée from the Rocher de Cancale. He mentioned\n      Muriton of red tongue; cauliflowers with _velouté_ sauce; veal _à\n      la St_. Menehoult; marinade _à la_ St. Florentin; and orange\n      jellies _en mosaïques_.\n\n      There was Bibulus O’Bumper. He touched upon Latour and\n      Markbrünnen; upon Mousseux and Chambertin; upon Richbourg and St.\n      George; upon Haubrion, Leonville, and Medoc; upon Barac and\r\nPreignac; upon Grâve, upon Sauterne, upon Lafitte, and upon St.\n      Peray. He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot, and told, with his\n      eyes shut, the difference between Sherry and Amontillado.\n\n      There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence. He discoursed of\n      Cimabué, Arpino, Carpaccio, and Argostino—of the gloom of\n      Caravaggio, of the amenity of Albano, of the colors of Titian, of\n      the frows of Rubens, and of the waggeries of Jan Steen.\n\n      There was the President of the Fum-Fudge University. He was of\r\nopinion that the moon was called Bendis in Thrace, Bubastis in\n      Egypt, Dian in Rome, and Artemis in Greece.\n\n      There was a Grand Turk from Stamboul. He could not help thinking\n      that the angels were horses, cocks, and bulls; that somebody in\n      the sixth heaven had seventy thousand heads; and that the earth\n      was supported by a sky-blue cow with an incalculable number of\n      green horns.\n\n      There was Delphinus Polyglott. He told us what had become of the\n      eighty-three lost tragedies of Æschylus; of the fifty-four","orations of Isæus; of the three hundred and ninety-one speeches\n      of Lysias; of the hundred and eighty treatises of Theophrastus;\n      of the eighth book of the conic sections of Apollonius; of\n      Pindar’s hymns and dithyrambics; and of the five and forty\n      tragedies of Homer Junior.\n\n      There was Ferdinand Fitz-Fossillus Feltspar. He informed us all\n      about internal fires and tertiary formations; about aëriforms,\n      fluidiforms, and solidiforms; about quartz and marl; about schist\n      and schorl; about gypsum and trap; about talc and calc; about\r\nblende and horn-blende; about mica-slate and pudding-stone; about\n      cyanite and lepidolite; about hematite and tremolite; about\n      antimony and calcedony; about manganese and whatever you please.\n\n      There was myself. I spoke of myself;—of myself, of myself, of\n      myself;—of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up\n      my nose, and I spoke of myself.\n\n      “Marvellous clever man!” said the Prince.\n\n      “Superb!” said his guests;—and next morning her Grace of\n      Bless-my-Soul paid me a visit.\r\n“Will you go to Almack’s, pretty creature?” she said, tapping me\n      under the chin.\n\n      “Upon honor,” said I.\n\n      “Nose and all?” she asked.\n\n      “As I live,” I replied.\n\n      “Here then is a card, my life. Shall I say you will be there?”\n\n      “Dear Duchess, with all my heart.”\n\n      “Pshaw, no!—but with all your nose?”\n\n      “Every bit of it, my love,” said I:—so I gave it a twist or two,\n      and found myself at Almack’s. The rooms were crowded to\n      suffocation.\n\n      “He is coming!” said somebody on the staircase.\r\n“He is coming!” said somebody farther up.\n\n      “He is coming!” said somebody farther still.\n\n      “He is come!” exclaimed the Duchess. “He is come, the little\n      love!”—and, seizing me firmly by both hands, she kissed me thrice\n      upon the nose. A marked sensation immediately ensued.\n\n      “_Diavolo!_” cried Count Capricornutti.\n\n      “_Dios guarda!_” muttered Don Stiletto.\n\n      “_Mille tonnerres!_” ejaculated the Prince de Grenouille.\n\n      “_Tousand teufel!_” growled the Elector of Bluddennuff.\n\n      It was not to be borne. I grew angry. I turned short upon","Bluddennuff.\n\n      “Sir!” said I to him, “you are a baboon.”\n\n      “Sir,” he replied, after a pause, “_Donner und Blitzen!_”\n\n      This was all that could be desired. We exchanged cards. At\n      Chalk-Farm, the next morning, I shot off his nose—and then called\n      upon my friends.\n\n      “_Bête!_” said the first.\n\n      “Fool!” said the second.\n\n      “Dolt!” said the third.\n\n      “Ass!” said the fourth.\n\n      “Ninny!” said the fifth.\n\n      “Noodle!” said the sixth.\n\n      “Be off!” said the seventh.\n\n      At all this I felt mortified, and so called upon my father.\r\n“Father,” I asked, “what is the chief end of my existence?”\n\n      “My son,” he replied, “it is still the study of Nosology; but in\n      hitting the Elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark.\n      You have a fine nose, it is true; but then Bluddennuff has none.\n      You are damned, and he has become the hero of the day. I grant\n      you that in Fum-Fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to\n      the size of his proboscis—but, good heavens! there is no\n      competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all.”\r\nX-ING A PARAGRAB\n\n\n      As it is well known that the ‘wise men’ came ‘from the East,’ and\n      as Mr. Touch-and-go Bullet-head came from the East, it follows\n      that Mr. Bullet-head was a wise man; and if collateral proof of\n      the matter be needed, here we have it—Mr. B. was an editor.\n      Irascibility was his sole foible, for in fact the obstinacy of\n      which men accused him was anything but his foible, since he\n      justly considered it his forte. It was his strong point—his\n      virtue; and it would have required all the logic of a Brownson to\r\nconvince him that it was ‘anything else.’\n\n      I have shown that Touch-and-go Bullet-head was a wise man; and\n      the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible, was when,\n      abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men, the East, he\n      migrated to the city of Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, or some\n      place of a similar title, out West.\n\n      I must do him the justice to say, however, that when he made up\n      his mind finally to settle in that town, it was under the","impression that no newspaper, and consequently no editor, existed\n      in that particular section of the country. In establishing ‘The\n      Tea-Pot’ he expected to have the field all to himself. I feel\n      confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence\n      in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis had he been aware that, in\n      Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, there lived a gentleman named John\n      Smith (if I rightly remember), who for many years had there\n      quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the\n      ‘Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis Gazette.’ It was solely,\r\ntherefore, on account of having been misinformed, that Mr.\n      Bullet-head found himself in Alex—— suppose we call it Nopolis,\n      ‘for short’—but, as he did find himself there, he determined to\n      keep up his character for obst—for firmness, and remain. So\n      remain he did; and he did more; he unpacked his press, type,\n      etc., etc., rented an office exactly opposite to that of the\n      ‘Gazette,’ and, on the third morning after his arrival, issued\n      the first number of ‘The Alexan’—that is to say, of ‘The Nopolis\r\nTea-Pot’—as nearly as I can recollect, this was the name of the\n      new paper.\n\n      The leading article, I must admit, was brilliant—not to say\n      severe. It was especially bitter about things in general—and as\n      for the editor of ‘The Gazette,’ he was torn all to pieces in\n      particular. Some of Bullet-head’s remarks were really so fiery\n      that I have always, since that time, been forced to look upon\n      John Smith, who is still alive, in the light of a salamander. I\n      cannot pretend to give all the ‘Tea-Pot’s’ paragraphs verbatim,\r\nbut one of them runs thus:\n\n      ‘Oh, yes!—Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! The editor over the way\n      is a genius—O, my! Oh, goodness, gracious!—what is this world\n      coming to? Oh, tempora! Oh, Moses!’\n\n      A philippic at once so caustic and so classical, alighted like a\n      bombshell among the hitherto peaceful citizens of Nopolis. Groups\n      of excited individuals gathered at the corners of the streets.\n      Every one awaited, with heartfelt anxiety, the reply of the\n      dignified Smith. Next morning it appeared as follows:","‘We quote from “The Tea-Pot” of yesterday the subjoined\n      paragraph: “Oh, yes! Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! Oh, my! Oh,\n      goodness! Oh, tempora! Oh, Moses!” Why, the fellow is all O! That\n      accounts for his reasoning in a circle, and explains why there is\n      neither beginning nor end to him, nor to anything he says. We\n      really do not believe the vagabond can write a word that hasn’t\n      an O in it. Wonder if this O-ing is a habit of his? By-the-by, he\n      came away from Down-East in a great hurry. Wonder if he O’s as\r\nmuch there as he does here? “O! it is pitiful.”’\n\n      The indignation of Mr. Bullet-head at these scandalous\n      insinuations, I shall not attempt to describe. On the\n      eel-skinning principle, however, he did not seem to be so much\n      incensed at the attack upon his integrity as one might have\n      imagined. It was the sneer at his style that drove him to\n      desperation. What!—he Touch-and-go Bullet-head!—not able to write\n      a word without an O in it! He would soon let the jackanapes see\n      that he was mistaken. Yes! he would let him see how much he was\r\nmistaken, the puppy! He, Touch-and-go Bullet-head, of\n      Frogpondium, would let Mr. John Smith perceive that he,\n      Bullet-head, could indite, if it so pleased him, a whole\n      paragraph—aye! a whole article—in which that contemptible vowel\n      should not once—not even once—make its appearance. But no;—that\n      would be yielding a point to the said John Smith. He,\n      Bullet-head, would make no alteration in his style, to suit the\n      caprices of any Mr. Smith in Christendom. Perish so vile a\n      thought! The O forever; He would persist in the O. He would be as\r\nO-wy as O-wy could be.\n\n      Burning with the chivalry of this determination, the great\n      Touch-and-go, in the next ‘Tea-Pot,’ came out merely with this\n      simple but resolute paragraph, in reference to this unhappy\n      affair:\n\n      ‘The editor of the “Tea-Pot” has the honor of advising the editor\n      of the “Gazette” that he (the “Tea-Pot”) will take an opportunity\n      in tomorrow morning’s paper, of convincing him (the “Gazette”)\n      that he (the “Tea-Pot”) both can and will be _his own master_, as","regards style;—he (the “Tea-Pot”) intending to show him (the\n      “Gazette”) the supreme, and indeed the withering contempt with\n      which the criticism of him (the “Gazette”) inspires the\n      independent bosom of him (the “Tea-Pot”) by composing for the\n      especial gratification (?) of him (the “Gazette”) a leading\n      article, of some extent, in which the beautiful vowel—the emblem\n      of Eternity—yet so offensive to the hyper-exquisite delicacy of\n      him (the “Gazette”) shall most certainly not be avoided by his\r\n(the “Gazette’s”) most obedient, humble servant, the “Tea-Pot.”\n      “So much for Buckingham!”’\n\n      In fulfilment of the awful threat thus darkly intimated rather\n      than decidedly enunciated, the great Bullet-head, turning a deaf\n      ear to all entreaties for ‘copy,’ and simply requesting his\n      foreman to ‘go to the d——l,’ when he (the foreman) assured him\n      (the ‘Tea-Pot’!) that it was high time to ‘go to press’: turning\n      a deaf ear to everything, I say, the great Bullet-head sat up\n      until day-break, consuming the midnight oil, and absorbed in the\r\ncomposition of the really unparalleled paragraph, which follows:—\n\n      ‘So ho, John! how now? Told you so, you know. Don’t crow, another\n      time, before you’re out of the woods! Does your mother know\n      you’re out? Oh, no, no!—so go home at once, now, John, to your\n      odious old woods of Concord! Go home to your woods, old owl—go!\n      You won’t! Oh, poh, poh, John don’t do so! You’ve _got_ to go,\n      you know! So go at once, and don’t go slow, for nobody owns you\n      here, you know! Oh! John, John, if you don’t go you’re no\r\nhomo—no! You’re only a fowl, an owl; a cow, a sow; a doll, a\n      poll; a poor, old, good-for-nothing-to-nobody, log, dog, hog, or\n      frog, come out of a Concord bog. Cool, now—cool! Do be cool, you\n      fool! None of your crowing, old cock! Don’t frown so—don’t! Don’t\n      hollo, nor howl nor growl, nor bow-wow-wow! Good Lord, John, how\n      you do look! Told you so, you know—but stop rolling your goose of\n      an old poll about so, and go and drown your sorrows in a bowl!’\n\n      Exhausted, very naturally, by so stupendous an effort, the great","Touch-and-go could attend to nothing farther that night. Firmly,\n      composedly, yet with an air of conscious power, he handed his MS.\n      to the devil in waiting, and then, walking leisurely home,\n      retired, with ineffable dignity to bed.\n\n      Meantime the devil, to whom the copy was entrusted, ran up stairs\n      to his ‘case,’ in an unutterable hurry, and forthwith made a\n      commencement at ‘setting’ the MS. ‘up.’\n\n      In the first place, of course,—as the opening word was ‘So,’—he\n      made a plunge into the capital S hole and came out in triumph\r\nwith a capital S. Elated by this success, he immediately threw\n      himself upon the little-o box with a blindfold impetuosity—but\n      who shall describe his horror when his fingers came up without\n      the anticipated letter in their clutch? who shall paint his\n      astonishment and rage at perceiving, as he rubbed his knuckles,\n      that he had been only thumping them to no purpose, against the\n      bottom of an empty box. Not a single little-o was in the little-o\n      hole; and, glancing fearfully at the capital-O partition, he\r\nfound _that_, to his extreme terror, in a precisely similar\n      predicament. Awe-stricken, his first impulse was to rush to the\n      foreman.\n\n      ‘Sir!’ said he, gasping for breath, ‘I can’t never set up nothing\n      without no o’s.’\n\n      ‘What do you mean by that?’ growled the foreman, who was in a\n      very ill humor at being kept so late.\n\n      ‘Why, sir, there beant an o in the office, neither a big un nor a\n      little un!’\n\n      ‘What—what the d—l has become of all that were in the case?’\r\n‘I don’t know, sir,’ said the boy, ‘but one of them ere “G’zette”\n      devils is bin prowling ’bout here all night, and I spect he’s\n      gone and cabbaged ‘em every one.’\n\n      ‘Dod rot him! I haven’t a doubt of it,’ replied the foreman,\n      getting purple with rage ‘but I tell you what you do, Bob, that’s\n      a good boy—you go over the first chance you get and hook every\n      one of their i’s and (d——n them!) their izzards.’\n\n      ‘Jist so,’ replied Bob, with a wink and a frown—‘I’ll be into\n      ‘em, I’ll let ‘em know a thing or two; but in de meantime, that","ere paragrab? Mus go in to-night, you know—else there’ll be the\n      d—l to pay, and—’\n\n      ‘And not a bit of pitch hot,’ interrupted the foreman, with a\n      deep sigh, and an emphasis on the ‘bit.’ ‘Is it a long paragraph,\n      Bob?’\n\n      ‘Shouldn’t call it a _wery_ long paragrab,’ said Bob.\n\n      ‘Ah, well, then! do the best you can with it! We must get to\n      press,’ said the foreman, who was over head and ears in work;\n      ‘just stick in some other letter for o; nobody’s going to read\n      the fellow’s trash anyhow.’\r\n‘Wery well,’ replied Bob, ‘here goes it!’ and off he hurried to\n      his case, muttering as he went: ‘Considdeble vell, them ere\n      expressions, perticcler for a man as doesn’t swar. So I’s to\n      gouge out all their eyes, eh? and d-n all their gizzards! Vell!\n      this here’s the chap as is just able for to do it.’ The fact is\n      that although Bob was but twelve years old and four feet high, he\n      was equal to any amount of fight, in a small way.\n\n      The exigency here described is by no means of rare occurrence in\r\nprinting-offices; and I cannot tell how to account for it, but\n      the fact is indisputable, that when the exigency does occur, it\n      almost always happens that x is adopted as a substitute for the\n      letter deficient. The true reason, perhaps, is that x is rather\n      the most superabundant letter in the cases, or at least was so in\n      the old times—long enough to render the substitution in question\n      an habitual thing with printers. As for Bob, he would have\n      considered it heretical to employ any other character, in a case\r\nof this kind, than the x to which he had been accustomed.\n\n      ‘I shell have to x this ere paragrab,’ said he to himself, as he\n      read it over in astonishment, ‘but it’s jest about the awfulest\n      o-wy paragrab I ever did see’: so x it he did, unflinchingly, and\n      to press it went x-ed.\n\n      Next morning the population of Nopolis were taken all aback by\n      reading in ‘The Tea-Pot,’ the following extraordinary leader:\n\n      ‘Sx hx, Jxhn! hxw nxw?

The first definite idea entertained by\n      the populace was, that some diabolical treason lay concealed in\n      the hieroglyphics; and there was a general rush to Bullet-head’s\r\nresidence, for the purpose of riding him on a rail; but that\n      gentleman was nowhere to be found. He had vanished, no one could\n      tell how; and not even the ghost of him has ever been seen since.\n\n      Unable to discover its legitimate object, the popular fury at\n      length subsided; leaving behind it, by way of sediment, quite a\n      medley of opinion about this unhappy affair.\n\n      One gentleman thought the whole an X-ellent joke.\n\n      Another said that, indeed, Bullet-head had shown much X-uberance\n      of fancy.\r\nA third admitted him X-entric, but no more.\n\n      A fourth could only suppose it the Yankee’s design to X-press, in\n      a general way, his X-asperation.\n\n      ‘Say, rather, to set an X-ample to posterity,’ suggested a fifth.\n\n      That Bullet-head had been driven to an extremity, was clear to\n      all; and in fact, since that editor could not be found, there was\n      some talk about lynching the other one.\n\n      The more common conclusion, however, was that the affair was,\n      simply, X-traordinary and in-X-plicable. Even the town","mathematician confessed that he could make nothing of so dark a\n      problem. X, everybody knew, was an unknown quantity; but in this\n      case (as he properly observed), there was an unknown quantity of\n      X.\n\n      The opinion of Bob, the devil (who kept dark about his having\n      ‘X-ed the paragrab’), did not meet with so much attention as I\n      think it deserved, although it was very openly and very\n      fearlessly expressed. He said that, for his part, he had no doubt\n      about the matter at all, that it was a clear case, that Mr.\r\nBullet-head ‘never could be persuaded fur to drink like other\n      folks, but vas continually a-svigging o’ that ere blessed XXX\n      ale, and as a naiteral consekvence, it just puffed him up savage,\n      and made him X (cross) in the X-treme.’\n\n\n\n\nMETZENGERSTEIN\n\n\n     Pestis eram vivus—moriens tua mors ero.\n                    —_Martin Luther_\n\n      Horror and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages. Why\n      then give a date to this story I have to tell? Let it suffice to\n      say, that at the period of which I speak, there existed, in the\r\ninterior of Hungary, a settled although hidden belief in the\n      doctrines of the Metempsychosis. Of the doctrines themselves—that\n      is, of their falsity, or of their probability—I say nothing. I\n      assert, however, that much of our incredulity—as La Bruyère says\n      of all our unhappiness—“_vient de ne pouvoir être seuls_.” {*1}\n\n      But there are some points in the Hungarian superstition which\n      were fast verging to absurdity. They—the Hungarians—differed very\n      essentially from their Eastern authorities. For example, “_The\r\nsoul_,” said the former—I give the words of an acute and\n      intelligent Parisian—“_ne demeure qu’un seul fois dans un corps\n      sensible: au reste—un cheval, un chien, un homme même, n’est que\n      la ressemblance peu tangible de ces animaux._”\n\n      The families of Berlifitzing and Metzengerstein had been at\n      variance for centuries. Never before were two houses so\n      illustrious, mutually embittered by hostility so deadly. The\n      origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an\n      ancient prophecy—“A lofty name shall have a fearful fall when, as","the rider over his horse, the mortality of Metzengerstein shall\n      triumph over the immortality of Berlifitzing.”\n\n      To be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning. But\n      more trivial causes have given rise—and that no long while ago—to\n      consequences equally eventful. Besides, the estates, which were\n      contiguous, had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs\n      of a busy government. Moreover, near neighbors are seldom\n      friends; and the inhabitants of the Castle Berlifitzing might\r\nlook, from their lofty buttresses, into the very windows of the\n      palace Metzengerstein. Least of all had the more than feudal\n      magnificence, thus discovered, a tendency to allay the irritable\n      feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy Berlifitzings. What\n      wonder then, that the words, however silly, of that prediction,\n      should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two\n      families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of\n      hereditary jealousy? The prophecy seemed to imply—if it implied\r\nanything—a final triumph on the part of the already more powerful\n      house; and was of course remembered with the more bitter\n      animosity by the weaker and less influential.\n\n      Wilhelm, Count Berlifitzing, although loftily descended, was, at\n      the epoch of this narrative, an infirm and doting old man,\n      remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal\n      antipathy to the family of his rival, and so passionate a love of\n      horses, and of hunting, that neither bodily infirmity, great age,\r\nnor mental incapacity, prevented his daily participation in the\n      dangers of the chase.\n\n      Frederick, Baron Metzengerstein, was, on the other hand, not yet\n      of age. His father, the Minister G—, died young. His mother, the\n      Lady Mary, followed him quickly after. Frederick was, at that\n      time, in his fifteenth year. In a city, fifteen years are no long\n      period—a child may be still a child in his third lustrum: but in\n      a wilderness—in so magnificent a wilderness as that old\n      principality, fifteen years have a far deeper meaning.","From some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of\n      his father, the young Baron, at the decease of the former,\n      entered immediately upon his vast possessions. Such estates were\n      seldom held before by a nobleman of Hungary. His castles were\n      without number. The chief in point of splendor and extent was the\n      “Château Metzengerstein.” The boundary line of his dominions was\n      never clearly defined; but his principal park embraced a circuit\n      of fifty miles.\n\n      Upon the succession of a proprietor so young, with a character so\r\nwell known, to a fortune so unparalleled, little speculation was\n      afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct. And, indeed,\n      for the space of three days, the behavior of the heir out-Heroded\n      Herod, and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most\n      enthusiastic admirers. Shameful debaucheries—flagrant\n      treacheries—unheard-of atrocities—gave his trembling vassals\n      quickly to understand that no servile submission on their part—no\n      punctilios of conscience on his own—were thenceforward to prove\r\nany security against the remorseless fangs of a petty Caligula.\n      On the night of the fourth day, the stables of the castle\n      Berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire; and the unanimous\n      opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to\n      the already hideous list of the Baron’s misdemeanors and\n      enormities.\n\n      But during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence, the young\n      nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation, in a vast\n      and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of\r\nMetzengerstein. The rich although faded tapestry hangings which\n      swung gloomily upon the walls, represented the shadowy and\n      majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors. _Here_,\n      rich-ermined priests, and pontifical dignitaries, familiarly\n      seated with the autocrat and the sovereign, put a veto on the\n      wishes of a temporal king, or restrained with the fiat of papal\n      supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the Arch-enemy. _There_, the\n      dark, tall statures of the Princes Metzengerstein—their muscular","war-coursers plunging over the carcasses of fallen foes—startled\n      the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression; and _here_,\n      again, the voluptuous and swan-like figures of the dames of days\n      gone by, floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the\n      strains of imaginary melody.\n\n      But as the Baron listened, or affected to listen, to the\n      gradually increasing uproar in the stables of Berlifitzing—or\n      perhaps pondered upon some more novel, some more decided act of\n      audacity—his eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an\r\nenormous, and unnaturally colored horse, represented in the\n      tapestry as belonging to a Saracen ancestor of the family of his\n      rival. The horse itself, in the foreground of the design, stood\n      motionless and statue-like—while farther back, its discomfited\n      rider perished by the dagger of a Metzengerstein.\n\n      On Frederick’s lip arose a fiendish expression, as he became\n      aware of the direction which his glance had, without his\n      consciousness, assumed. Yet he did not remove it. On the\r\ncontrary, he could by no means account for the overwhelming\n      anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses. It\n      was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent\n      feelings with the certainty of being awake. The longer he gazed\n      the more absorbing became the spell—the more impossible did it\n      appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the\n      fascination of that tapestry. But the tumult without becoming\n      suddenly more violent, with a compulsory exertion he diverted his\r\nattention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming\n      stables upon the windows of the apartment.\n\n      The action, however, was but momentary, his gaze returned\n      mechanically to the wall. To his extreme horror and astonishment,\n      the head of the gigantic steed had, in the meantime, altered its\n      position. The neck of the animal, before arched, as if in\n      compassion, over the prostrate body of its lord, was now\n      extended, at full length, in the direction of the Baron. The\n      eyes, before invisible, now wore an energetic and human","expression, while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red; and\n      the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full\n      view his gigantic and disgusting teeth.\n\n      Stupefied with terror, the young nobleman tottered to the door.\n      As he threw it open, a flash of red light, streaming far into the\n      chamber, flung his shadow with a clear outline against the\n      quivering tapestry, and he shuddered to perceive that shadow—as\n      he staggered awhile upon the threshold—assuming the exact\n      position, and precisely filling up the contour, of the relentless\r\nand triumphant murderer of the Saracen Berlifitzing.\n\n      To lighten the depression of his spirits, the Baron hurried into\n      the open air. At the principal gate of the palace he encountered\n      three equerries. With much difficulty, and at the imminent peril\n      of their lives, they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a\n      gigantic and fiery-colored horse.\n\n      “Whose horse? Where did you get him?” demanded the youth, in a\n      querulous and husky tone of voice, as he became instantly aware\r\nthat the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very\n      counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes.\n\n      “He is your own property, sire,” replied one of the equerries,\n      “at least he is claimed by no other owner. We caught him flying,\n      all smoking and foaming with rage, from the burning stables of\n      the Castle Berlifitzing. Supposing him to have belonged to the\n      old Count’s stud of foreign horses, we led him back as an estray.\n      But the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature; which is\r\nstrange, since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow\n      escape from the flames.\n\n      “The letters W. V. B. are also branded very distinctly on his\n      forehead,” interrupted a second equerry, “I supposed them, of\n      course, to be the initials of Wilhelm Von Berlifitzing—but all at\n      the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse.”\n\n      “Extremely singular!” said the young Baron, with a musing air,\n      and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words. “He is,\n      as you say, a remarkable horse—a prodigious horse! although, as","you very justly observe, of a suspicious and untractable\n      character; let him be mine, however,” he added, after a pause,\n      “perhaps a rider like Frederick of Metzengerstein, may tame even\n      the devil from the stables of Berlifitzing.”\n\n      “You are mistaken, my lord; the horse, as I think we mentioned,\n      is _not_ from the stables of the Count. If such had been the\n      case, we know our duty better than to bring him into the presence\n      of a noble of your family.”\n\n      “True!” observed the Baron, dryly, and at that instant a page of\r\nthe bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color, and\n      a precipitate step. He whispered into his master’s ear an account\n      of the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry,\n      in an apartment which he designated; entering, at the same time,\n      into particulars of a minute and circumstantial character; but\n      from the low tone of voice in which these latter were\n      communicated, nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of\n      the equerries.\n\n      The young Frederick, during the conference, seemed agitated by a\r\nvariety of emotions. He soon, however, recovered his composure,\n      and an expression of determined malignancy settled upon his\n      countenance, as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber\n      should be immediately locked up, and the key placed in his own\n      possession.\n\n      “Have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter\n      Berlifitzing?” said one of his vassals to the Baron, as, after\n      the departure of the page, the huge steed which that nobleman had\n      adopted as his own, plunged and curvetted, with redoubled fury,\r\ndown the long avenue which extended from the château to the\n      stables of Metzengerstein.\n\n      “No!” said the Baron, turning abruptly toward the speaker, “dead!\n      say you?”\n\n      “It is indeed true, my lord; and, to a noble of your name, will\n      be, I imagine, no unwelcome intelligence.”\n\n      A rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener. “How\n      died he?”\n\n      “In his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his\n      hunting stud, he has himself perished miserably in the flames.”","“I-n-d-e-e-d-!” ejaculated the Baron, as if slowly and\n      deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea.\n\n      “Indeed;” repeated the vassal.\n\n      “Shocking!” said the youth, calmly, and turned quietly into the\n      château.\n\n      From this date a marked alteration took place in the outward\n      demeanor of the dissolute young Baron Frederick Von\n      Metzengerstein. Indeed, his behavior disappointed every\n      expectation, and proved little in accordance with the views of\n      many a manoeuvering mamma; while his habits and manner, still\r\nless than formerly, offered any thing congenial with those of the\n      neighboring aristocracy. He was never to be seen beyond the\n      limits of his own domain, and, in this wide and social world, was\n      utterly companionless—unless, indeed, that unnatural, impetuous,\n      and fiery-colored horse, which he henceforward continually\n      bestrode, had any mysterious right to the title of his friend.\n\n      Numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long\n      time, however, periodically came in. “Will the Baron honor our\r\nfestivals with his presence?” “Will the Baron join us in a\n      hunting of the boar?”—“Metzengerstein does not hunt;”\n      “Metzengerstein will not attend,” were the haughty and laconic\n      answers.\n\n      These repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious\n      nobility. Such invitations became less cordial—less frequent—in\n      time they ceased altogether. The widow of the unfortunate Count\n      Berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope “that the Baron\n      might be at home when he did not wish to be at home, since he\r\ndisdained the company of his equals; and ride when he did not\n      wish to ride, since he preferred the society of a horse.” This to\n      be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique; and\n      merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to\n      become, when we desire to be unusually energetic.\n\n      The charitable, nevertheless, attributed the alteration in the\n      conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for\n      the untimely loss of his parents—forgetting, however, his","atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period\n      immediately succeeding that bereavement. Some there were, indeed,\n      who suggested a too haughty idea of self-consequence and dignity.\n      Others again (among them may be mentioned the family physician)\n      did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy, and hereditary\n      ill-health; while dark hints, of a more equivocal nature, were\n      current among the multitude.\n\n      Indeed, the Baron’s perverse attachment to his lately-acquired\n      charger—an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from\r\nevery fresh example of the animal’s ferocious and demon-like\n      propensities—at length became, in the eyes of all reasonable men,\n      a hideous and unnatural fervor. In the glare of noon—at the dead\n      hour of night—in sickness or in health—in calm or in tempest—the\n      young Metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that\n      colossal horse, whose intractable audacities so well accorded\n      with his own spirit.\n\n      There were circumstances, moreover, which coupled with late\n      events, gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania\r\nof the rider, and to the capabilities of the steed. The space\n      passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured, and\n      was found to exceed, by an astounding difference, the wildest\n      expectations of the most imaginative. The Baron, besides, had no\n      particular _name_ for the animal, although all the rest in his\n      collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations. His\n      stable, too, was appointed at a distance from the rest; and with\n      regard to grooming and other necessary offices, none but the\r\nowner in person had ventured to officiate, or even to enter the\n      enclosure of that particular stall. It was also to be observed,\n      that although the three grooms, who had caught the steed as he\n      fled from the conflagration at Berlifitzing, had succeeded in\n      arresting his course, by means of a chain-bridle and noose—yet no\n      one of the three could with any certainty affirm that he had,\n      during that dangerous struggle, or at any period thereafter,\n      actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast. Instances of","peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and\n      high-spirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting\n      unreasonable attention—especially among men who, daily trained to\n      the labors of the chase, might appear well acquainted with the\n      sagacity of a horse—but there were certain circumstances which\n      intruded themselves per force upon the most skeptical and\n      phlegmatic; and it is said there were times when the animal\n      caused the gaping crowd who stood around to recoil in horror from\r\nthe deep and impressive meaning of his terrible stamp—times when\n      the young Metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away from the\n      rapid and searching expression of his earnest and human-looking\n      eye.\n\n      Among all the retinue of the Baron, however, none were found to\n      doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on\n      the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his\n      horse; at least, none but an insignificant and misshapen little\n      page, whose deformities were in everybody’s way, and whose\r\nopinions were of the least possible importance. He—if his ideas\n      are worth mentioning at all—had the effrontery to assert that his\n      master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and\n      almost imperceptible shudder, and that, upon his return from\n      every long-continued and habitual ride, an expression of\n      triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance.\n\n      One tempestuous night, Metzengerstein, awaking from a heavy\n      slumber, descended like a maniac from his chamber, and, mounting\r\nin hot haste, bounded away into the mazes of the forest. An\n      occurrence so common attracted no particular attention, but his\n      return was looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his\n      domestics, when, after some hours’ absence, the stupendous and\n      magnificent battlements of the Chateau Metzengerstein, were\n      discovered crackling and rocking to their very foundation, under\n      the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire.\n\n      As the flames, when first seen, had already made so terrible a","progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building\n      were evidently futile, the astonished neighborhood stood idly\n      around in silent and pathetic wonder. But a new and fearful\n      object soon rivetted the attention of the multitude, and proved\n      how much more intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings\n      of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony, than that brought\n      about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate matter.\n\n      Up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the\r\nmain entrance of the Château Metzengerstein, a steed, bearing an\n      unbonneted and disordered rider, was seen leaping with an\n      impetuosity which outstripped the very Demon of the Tempest.\n\n      The career of the horseman was indisputably, on his own part,\n      uncontrollable. The agony of his countenance, the convulsive\n      struggle of his frame, gave evidence of superhuman exertion: but\n      no sound, save a solitary shriek, escaped from his lacerated\n      lips, which were bitten through and through in the intensity of\r\nterror. One instant, and the clattering of hoofs resounded\n      sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the\n      shrieking of the winds—another, and, clearing at a single plunge\n      the gate-way and the moat, the steed bounded far up the tottering\n      staircases of the palace, and, with its rider, disappeared amid\n      the whirlwind of chaotic fire.\n\n      The fury of the tempest immediately died away, and a dead calm\n      sullenly succeeded. A white flame still enveloped the building\r\nlike a shroud, and, streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere,\n      shot forth a glare of preternatural light; while a cloud of smoke\n      settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal\n      figure of—_a horse_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SYSTEM OF DOCTOR TARR AND PROFESSOR FETHER\n\n\n      During the autumn of 18—, while on a tour through the extreme\n      southern provinces of France, my route led me within a few miles\n      of a certain _Maison de Santé_ or private mad-house, about which\n      I had heard much, in Paris, from my medical friends. As I had","never visited a place of the kind, I thought the opportunity too\n      good to be lost; and so proposed to my travelling companion (a\n      gentleman with whom I had made casual acquaintance a few days\n      before), that we should turn aside, for an hour or so, and look\n      through the establishment. To this he objected—pleading haste in\n      the first place, and, in the second, a very usual horror at the\n      sight of a lunatic. He begged me, however, not to let any mere\n      courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my\r\ncuriosity, and said that he would ride on leisurely, so that I\n      might overtake him during the day, or, at all events, during the\n      next. As he bade me good-bye, I bethought me that there might be\n      some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises, and\n      mentioned my fears on this point. He replied that, in fact,\n      unless I had personal knowledge of the superintendent, Monsieur\n      Maillard, or some credential in the way of a letter, a difficulty\n      might be found to exist, as the regulations of these private\r\nmad-houses were more rigid than the public hospital laws. For\n      himself, he added, he had, some years since, made the\n      acquaintance of Maillard, and would so far assist me as to ride\n      up to the door and introduce me; although his feelings on the\n      subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house.\n\n      I thanked him, and, turning from the main road, we entered a\n      grass-grown by-path, which, in half an hour, nearly lost itself\n      in a dense forest, clothing the base of a mountain. Through this\r\ndank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles, when the _Maison de\n      Santé_ came in view. It was a fantastic château, much\n      dilapidated, and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and\n      neglect. Its aspect inspired me with absolute dread, and,\n      checking my horse, I half resolved to turn back. I soon, however,\n      grew ashamed of my weakness, and proceeded.\n\n      As we rode up to the gate-way, I perceived it slightly open, and\n      the visage of a man peering through. In an instant afterward,\n      this man came forth, accosted my companion by name, shook him","cordially by the hand, and begged him to alight. It was Monsieur\n      Maillard himself. He was a portly, fine-looking gentleman of the\n      old school, with a polished manner, and a certain air of gravity,\n      dignity, and authority which was very impressive.\n\n      My friend, having presented me, mentioned my desire to inspect\n      the establishment, and received Monsieur Maillard’s assurance\n      that he would show me all attention, now took leave, and I saw\n      him no more.\n\n      When he had gone, the superintendent ushered me into a small and\r\nexceedingly neat parlor, containing, among other indications of\n      refined taste, many books, drawings, pots of flowers, and musical\n      instruments. A cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth. At a piano,\n      singing an aria from Bellini, sat a young and very beautiful\n      woman, who, at my entrance, paused in her song, and received me\n      with graceful courtesy. Her voice was low, and her whole manner\n      subdued. I thought, too, that I perceived the traces of sorrow in\n      her countenance, which was excessively, although to my taste, not\r\nunpleasingly, pale. She was attired in deep mourning, and excited\n      in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect, interest, and\n      admiration.\n\n      I had heard, at Paris, that the institution of Monsieur Maillard\n      was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the “system of\n      soothing”—that all punishments were avoided—that even confinement\n      was seldom resorted to—that the patients, while secretly watched,\n      were left much apparent liberty, and that most of them were\n      permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary\r\napparel of persons in right mind.\n\n      Keeping these impressions in view, I was cautious in what I said\n      before the young lady; for I could not be sure that she was sane;\n      and, in fact, there was a certain restless brilliancy about her\n      eyes which half led me to imagine she was not. I confined my\n      remarks, therefore, to general topics, and to such as I thought\n      would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic. She\n      replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that I said; and","even her original observations were marked with the soundest good\n      sense, but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania, had\n      taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity, and I\n      continued to practise, throughout the interview, the caution with\n      which I commenced it.\n\n      Presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit,\n      wine, and other refreshments, of which I partook, the lady soon\n      afterward leaving the room. As she departed I turned my eyes in\n      an inquiring manner toward my host.\r\n“No,” he said, “oh, no—a member of my family—my niece, and a most\n      accomplished woman.”\n\n      “I beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion,” I replied, “but of\n      course you will know how to excuse me. The excellent\n      administration of your affairs here is well understood in Paris,\n      and I thought it just possible, you know—”\n\n      “Yes, yes—say no more—or rather it is myself who should thank you\n      for the commendable prudence you have displayed. We seldom find\n      so much of forethought in young men; and, more than once, some\r\nunhappy contre-temps has occurred in consequence of\n      thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors. While my former\n      system was in operation, and my patients were permitted the\n      privilege of roaming to and fro at will, they were often aroused\n      to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to\n      inspect the house. Hence I was obliged to enforce a rigid system\n      of exclusion; and none obtained access to the premises upon whose\n      discretion I could not rely.”\n\n      “While your former system was in operation!” I said, repeating\r\nhis words—“do I understand you, then, to say that the ‘soothing\n      system’ of which I have heard so much is no longer in force?”\n\n      “It is now,” he replied, “several weeks since we have concluded\n      to renounce it forever.”\n\n      “Indeed! you astonish me!”\n\n      “We found it, sir,” he said, with a sigh, “absolutely necessary\n      to return to the old usages. The danger of the soothing system\n      was, at all times, appalling; and its advantages have been much\n      overrated. I believe, sir, that in this house it has been given a","fair trial, if ever in any. We did every thing that rational\n      humanity could suggest. I am sorry that you could not have paid\n      us a visit at an earlier period, that you might have judged for\n      yourself. But I presume you are conversant with the soothing\n      practice—with its details.”\n\n      “Not altogether. What I have heard has been at third or fourth\n      hand.”\n\n      “I may state the system, then, in general terms, as one in which\n      the patients were _menagés_—humored. We contradicted no fancies\n      which entered the brains of the mad. On the contrary, we not only\r\nindulged but encouraged them; and many of our most permanent\n      cures have been thus effected. There is no argument which so\n      touches the feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad\n      absurdum. We have had men, for example, who fancied themselves\n      chickens. The cure was, to insist upon the thing as a fact—to\n      accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it\n      to be a fact—and thus to refuse him any other diet for a week\n      than that which properly appertains to a chicken. In this manner\r\na little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders.”\n\n      “But was this species of acquiescence all?”\n\n      “By no means. We put much faith in amusements of a simple kind,\n      such as music, dancing, gymnastic exercises generally, cards,\n      certain classes of books, and so forth. We affected to treat each\n      individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder; and the\n      word ‘lunacy’ was never employed. A great point was to set each\n      lunatic to guard the actions of all the others. To repose\r\nconfidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman, is to\n      gain him body and soul. In this way we were enabled to dispense\n      with an expensive body of keepers.”\n\n      “And you had no punishments of any kind?”\n\n      “None.”\n\n      “And you never confined your patients?”\n\n      “Very rarely. Now and then, the malady of some individual growing\n      to a crisis, or taking a sudden turn of fury, we conveyed him to\n      a secret cell, lest his disorder should infect the rest, and\n      there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friends—for with","the raging maniac we have nothing to do. He is usually removed to\n      the public hospitals.”\n\n      “And you have now changed all this—and you think for the better?”\n\n      “Decidedly. The system had its disadvantages, and even its\n      dangers. It is now, happily, exploded throughout all the _Maisons\n      de Santé_ of France.”\n\n      “I am very much surprised,” I said, “at what you tell me; for I\n      made sure that, at this moment, no other method of treatment for\n      mania existed in any portion of the country.”\r\n“You are young yet, my friend,” replied my host, “but the time\n      will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is\n      going on in the world, without trusting to the gossip of others.\n      Believe nothing you hear, and only one-half that you see. Now\n      about our _Maisons de Santé_, it is clear that some ignoramus has\n      misled you. After dinner, however, when you have sufficiently\n      recovered from the fatigue of your ride, I will be happy to take\n      you over the house, and introduce to you a system which, in my\r\nopinion, and in that of every one who has witnessed its\n      operation, is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised.”\n\n      “Your own?” I inquired—“one of your own invention?”\n\n      “I am proud,” he replied, “to acknowledge that it is—at least in\n      some measure.”\n\n      In this manner I conversed with Monsieur Maillard for an hour or\n      two, during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of\n      the place.\n\n      “I cannot let you see my patients,” he said, “just at present. To\n      a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in\r\nsuch exhibitions; and I do not wish to spoil your appetite for\n      dinner. We will dine. I can give you some veal a la Menehoult,\n      with cauliflowers in _velouté_ sauce—after that a glass of Clos\n      de Vougeot—then your nerves will be sufficiently steadied.”\n\n      At six, dinner was announced; and my host conducted me into a\n      large _salle à manger_, where a very numerous company were\n      assembled—twenty-five or thirty in all. They were, apparently,\n      people of rank—certainly of high breeding—although their","habiliments, I thought, were extravagantly rich, partaking\n      somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the _vielle\n      cour_. I noticed that at least two-thirds of these guests were\n      ladies; and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what\n      a Parisian would consider good taste at the present day. Many\n      females, for example, whose age could not have been less than\n      seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry, such as rings,\n      bracelets, and earrings, and wore their bosoms and arms\r\nshamefully bare. I observed, too, that very few of the dresses\n      were well made—or, at least, that very few of them fitted the\n      wearers. In looking about, I discovered the interesting girl to\n      whom Monsieur Maillard had presented me in the little parlor; but\n      my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale,\n      with high-heeled shoes, and a dirty cap of Brussels lace, so much\n      too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive\n      expression. When I had first seen her, she was attired, most\r\nbecomingly, in deep mourning. There was an air of oddity, in\n      short, about the dress of the whole party, which, at first,\n      caused me to recur to my original idea of the “soothing system,”\n      and to fancy that Monsieur Maillard had been willing to deceive\n      me until after dinner, that I might experience no uncomfortable\n      feelings during the repast, at finding myself dining with\n      lunatics; but I remembered having been informed, in Paris, that\n      the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people,\r\nwith a vast number of antiquated notions; and then, too, upon\n      conversing with several members of the company, my apprehensions\n      were immediately and fully dispelled.\n\n      The dining-room itself, although perhaps sufficiently comfortable\n      and of good dimensions, had nothing too much of elegance about\n      it. For example, the floor was uncarpeted; in France, however, a\n      carpet is frequently dispensed with. The windows, too, were\n      without curtains; the shutters, being shut, were securely\n      fastened with iron bars, applied diagonally, after the fashion of","our ordinary shop-shutters. The apartment, I observed, formed, in\n      itself, a wing of the château, and thus the windows were on three\n      sides of the parallelogram, the door being at the other. There\n      were no less than ten windows in all.\n\n      The table was superbly set out. It was loaded with plate, and\n      more than loaded with delicacies. The profusion was absolutely\n      barbaric. There were meats enough to have feasted the Anakim.\n      Never, in all my life, had I witnessed so lavish, so wasteful an\r\nexpenditure of the good things of life. There seemed very little\n      taste, however, in the arrangements; and my eyes, accustomed to\n      quiet lights, were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a\n      multitude of wax candles, which, in silver candelabra, were\n      deposited upon the table, and all about the room, wherever it was\n      possible to find a place. There were several active servants in\n      attendance; and, upon a large table, at the farther end of the\n      apartment, were seated seven or eight people with fiddles, fifes,\r\ntrombones, and a drum. These fellows annoyed me very much, at\n      intervals, during the repast, by an infinite variety of noises,\n      which were intended for music, and which appeared to afford much\n      entertainment to all present, with the exception of myself.\n\n      Upon the whole, I could not help thinking that there was much of\n      the bizarre about every thing I saw—but then the world is made up\n      of all kinds of persons, with all modes of thought, and all sorts\n      of conventional customs. I had travelled, too, so much, as to be\r\nquite an adept at the nil admirari; so I took my seat very coolly\n      at the right hand of my host, and, having an excellent appetite,\n      did justice to the good cheer set before me.\n\n      The conversation, in the meantime, was spirited and general. The\n      ladies, as usual, talked a great deal. I soon found that nearly\n      all the company were well educated; and my host was a world of\n      good-humored anecdote in himself. He seemed quite willing to\n      speak of his position as superintendent of a_Maison de Santé_;","and, indeed, the topic of lunacy was, much to my surprise, a\n      favorite one with all present. A great many amusing stories were\n      told, having reference to the _whims_ of the patients.\n\n      “We had a fellow here once,” said a fat little gentleman, who sat\n      at my right,—“a fellow that fancied himself a tea-pot; and by the\n      way, is it not especially singular how often this particular\n      crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic? There is scarcely\n      an insane asylum in France which cannot supply a human tea-pot.\r\nOur gentleman was a Britannia-ware tea-pot, and was careful to\n      polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting.”\n\n      “And then,” said a tall man just opposite, “we had here, not long\n      ago, a person who had taken it into his head that he was a\n      donkey—which allegorically speaking, you will say, was quite\n      true. He was a troublesome patient; and we had much ado to keep\n      him within bounds. For a long time he would eat nothing but\n      thistles; but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon\n      his eating nothing else. Then he was perpetually kicking out his\r\nheels—so—so—”\n\n      “Mr. De Kock! I will thank you to behave yourself!” here\n      interrupted an old lady, who sat next to the speaker. “Please\n      keep your feet to yourself! You have spoiled my brocade! Is it\n      necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?\n      Our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this. Upon\n      my word, you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate\n      imagined himself. Your acting is very natural, as I live.”\n\n      “Mille pardons! Ma’m’selle!” replied Monsieur De Kock, thus\r\naddressed—“a thousand pardons! I had no intention of offending.\n      Ma’m’selle Laplace—Monsieur De Kock will do himself the honor of\n      taking wine with you.”\n\n      Here Monsieur De Kock bowed low, kissed his hand with much\n      ceremony, and took wine with Ma’m’selle Laplace.\n\n      “Allow me, mon ami,” now said Monsieur Maillard, addressing\n      myself, “allow me to send you a morsel of this veal _à la St.\n      Menehoult_—you will find it particularly fine.”\n\n      At this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in","depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish, or trencher,\n      containing what I supposed to be the “_monstrum, horrendum,\n      informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum_.” A closer scrutiny assured\n      me, however, that it was only a small calf roasted whole, and set\n      upon its knees, with an apple in its mouth, as is the English\n      fashion of dressing a hare.\n\n      “Thank you, no,” I replied; “to say the truth, I am not\n      particularly partial to veal _à la St_.—what is it?—for I do not\r\nfind that it altogether agrees with me. I will change my plate,\n      however, and try some of the rabbit.”\n\n      There were several side-dishes on the table, containing what\n      appeared to be the ordinary French rabbit—a very delicious\n      morceau, which I can recommend.\n\n      “Pierre,” cried the host, “change this gentleman’s plate, and\n      give him a side-piece of this rabbit au-chat.”\n\n      “This what?” said I.\n\n      “This rabbit _au-chat_.”\n\n      “Why, thank you—upon second thoughts, no. I will just help myself\n      to some of the ham.”\r\nThere is no knowing what one eats, thought I to myself, at the\n      tables of these people of the province. I will have none of their\n      rabbit _au-chat_—and, for the matter of that, none of their\n      _cat-au-rabbit_ either.\n\n      “And then,” said a cadaverous looking personage, near the foot of\n      the table, taking up the thread of the conversation where it had\n      been broken off,—“and then, among other oddities, we had a\n      patient, once upon a time, who very pertinaciously maintained\n      himself to be a Cordova cheese, and went about, with a knife in\r\nhis hand, soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the\n      middle of his leg.”\n\n      “He was a great fool, beyond doubt,” interposed some one, “but\n      not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know,\n      with the exception of this strange gentleman. I mean the man who\n      took himself for a bottle of champagne, and always went off with\n      a pop and a fizz, in this fashion.”\n\n      Here the speaker, very rudely, as I thought, put his right thumb\n      in his left cheek, withdrew it with a sound resembling the","popping of a cork, and then, by a dexterous movement of the\n      tongue upon the teeth, created a sharp hissing and fizzing, which\n      lasted for several minutes, in imitation of the frothing of\n      champagne. This behavior, I saw plainly, was not very pleasing to\n      Monsieur Maillard; but that gentleman said nothing, and the\n      conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig.\n\n      “And then there was an ignoramus,” said he, “who mistook himself\n      for a frog, which, by the way, he resembled in no little degree.\r\nI wish you could have seen him, sir,”—here the speaker addressed\n      myself—“it would have done your heart good to see the natural\n      airs that he put on. Sir, if that man was not a frog, I can only\n      observe that it is a pity he was not. His croak\n      thus—o-o-o-o-gh—o-o-o-o-gh! was the finest note in the world—B\n      flat; and when he put his elbows upon the table thus—after taking\n      a glass or two of wine—and distended his mouth, thus, and rolled\n      up his eyes, thus, and winked them with excessive rapidity, thus,\r\nwhy then, sir, I take it upon myself to say, positively, that you\n      would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man.”\n\n      “I have no doubt of it,” I said.\n\n      “And then,” said somebody else, “then there was Petit Gaillard,\n      who thought himself a pinch of snuff, and was truly distressed\n      because he could not take himself between his own finger and\n      thumb.”\n\n      “And then there was Jules Desoulières, who was a very singular\n      genius, indeed, and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin.\r\nHe persecuted the cook to make him up into pies—a thing which the\n      cook indignantly refused to do. For my part, I am by no means\n      sure that a pumpkin pie _à la Desoulières_ would not have been\n      very capital eating indeed!”\n\n      “You astonish me!” said I; and I looked inquisitively at Monsieur\n      Maillard.\n\n      “Ha! ha! ha!” said that gentleman—“he! he! he!—hi! hi! hi!—ho!\n      ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!—very good indeed! You must not be astonished,\n      _mon ami;_ our friend here is a wit—a _drôle_—you must not\n      understand him to the letter.”","“And then,” said some other one of the party,—“then there was\n      Bouffon Le Grand—another extraordinary personage in his way. He\n      grew deranged through love, and fancied himself possessed of two\n      heads. One of these he maintained to be the head of Cicero; the\n      other he imagined a composite one, being Demosthenes’ from the\n      top of the forehead to the mouth, and Lord Brougham’s from the\n      mouth to the chin. It is not impossible that he was wrong; but he\n      would have convinced you of his being in the right; for he was a\r\nman of great eloquence. He had an absolute passion for oratory,\n      and could not refrain from display. For example, he used to leap\n      upon the dinner-table thus, and—and—”\n\n      Here a friend, at the side of the speaker, put a hand upon his\n      shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear; upon which he\n      ceased talking with great suddenness, and sank back within his\n      chair.\n\n      “And then,” said the friend who had whispered, “there was\n      Boullard, the tee-totum. I call him the tee-totum because, in\n      fact, he was seized with the droll, but not altogether\r\nirrational, crotchet, that he had been converted into a\n      tee-totum. You would have roared with laughter to see him spin.\n      He would turn round upon one heel by the hour, in this\n      manner—so—”\n\n      Here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper,\n      performed an exactly similar office for himself.\n\n      “But then,” cried the old lady, at the top of her voice, “your\n      Monsieur Boullard was a madman, and a very silly madman at best;\n      for who, allow me to ask you, ever heard of a human tee-totum?\r\nThe thing is absurd. Madame Joyeuse was a more sensible person,\n      as you know. She had a crotchet, but it was instinct with common\n      sense, and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her\n      acquaintance. She found, upon mature deliberation, that, by some\n      accident, she had been turned into a chicken-cock; but, as such,\n      she behaved with propriety. She flapped her wings with prodigious\n      effect—so—so—so—and, as for her crow, it was delicious!\n      Cock-a-doodle-doo!—cock-a-doodle-doo!—cock-a-doodle-de-doo\n      dooo-do-o-o-o-o-o-o!”","“Madame Joyeuse, I will thank you to behave yourself!” here\n      interrupted our host, very angrily. “You can either conduct\n      yourself as a lady should do, or you can quit the table\n      forthwith—take your choice.”\n\n      The lady (whom I was much astonished to hear addressed as Madame\n      Joyeuse, after the description of Madame Joyeuse she had just\n      given) blushed up to the eyebrows, and seemed exceedingly abashed\n      at the reproof. She hung down her head, and said not a syllable\n      in reply. But another and younger lady resumed the theme. It was\r\nmy beautiful girl of the little parlor.\n\n      “Oh, Madame Joyeuse was a fool!” she exclaimed, “but there was\n      really much sound sense, after all, in the opinion of Eugénie\n      Salsafette. She was a very beautiful and painfully modest young\n      lady, who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent, and\n      wished to dress herself, always, by getting outside instead of\n      inside of her clothes. It is a thing very easily done, after all.\n      You have only to do so—and then so—so—so—and then so—so—so—and\r\nthen so—so—and then—”\n\n      “Mon dieu! Ma’m’selle Salsafette!” here cried a dozen voices at\n      once. “What are you about?—forbear!—that is sufficient!—we see,\n      very plainly, how it is done!—hold! hold!” and several persons\n      were already leaping from their seats to withhold Ma’m’selle\n      Salsafette from putting herself upon a par with the Medicean\n      Venus, when the point was very effectually and suddenly\n      accomplished by a series of loud screams, or yells, from some\n      portion of the main body of the _château_.\r\nMy nerves were very much affected, indeed, by these yells; but\n      the rest of the company I really pitied. I never saw any set of\n      reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life. They all\n      grew as pale as so many corpses, and, shrinking within their\n      seats, sat quivering and gibbering with terror, and listening for\n      a repetition of the sound. It came again—louder and seemingly\n      nearer—and then a third time very loud, and then a fourth time\n      with a vigor evidently diminished. At this apparent dying away of","the noise, the spirits of the company were immediately regained,\n      and all was life and anecdote as before. I now ventured to\n      inquire the cause of the disturbance.\n\n      “A mere _bagatelle_,” said Monsieur Maillard. “We are used to\n      these things, and care really very little about them. The\n      lunatics, every now and then, get up a howl in concert; one\n      starting another, as is sometimes the case with a bevy of dogs at\n      night. It occasionally happens, however, that the _concerto_\n      yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose;\r\nwhen, of course, some little danger is to be apprehended.”\n\n      “And how many have you in charge?”\n\n      “At present we have not more than ten, altogether.”\n\n      “Principally females, I presume?”\n\n      “Oh, no—every one of them men, and stout fellows, too, I can tell\n      you.”\n\n      “Indeed! I have always understood that the majority of lunatics\n      were of the gentler sex.”\n\n      “It is generally so, but not always. Some time ago, there were\n      about twenty-seven patients here; and, of that number, no less\r\nthan eighteen were women; but, lately, matters have changed very\n      much, as you see.”\n\n      “Yes—have changed very much, as you see,” here interrupted the\n      gentleman who had broken the shins of Ma’m’selle Laplace.\n\n      “Yes—have changed very much, as you see!” chimed in the whole\n      company at once.\n\n      “Hold your tongues, every one of you!” said my host, in a great\n      rage. Whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for\n      nearly a minute. As for one lady, she obeyed Monsieur Maillard to\r\nthe letter, and thrusting out her tongue, which was an\n      excessively long one, held it very resignedly, with both hands,\n      until the end of the entertainment.\n\n      “And this gentlewoman,” said I, to Monsieur Maillard, bending\n      over and addressing him in a whisper—“this good lady who has just\n      spoken, and who gives us the cock-a-doodle-de-doo—she, I presume,\n      is harmless—quite harmless, eh?”\n\n      “Harmless!” ejaculated he, in unfeigned surprise, “why—why, what\n      can you mean?”\n\n      “Only slightly touched?” said I, touching my head. “I take it for","granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected,\n      eh?”\n\n      “_Mon dieu!_ what is it you imagine? This lady, my particular old\n      friend Madame Joyeuse, is as absolutely sane as myself. She has\n      her little eccentricities, to be sure—but then, you know, all old\n      women—all _very_ old women—are more or less eccentric!”\n\n      “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure—and then the rest of these\n      ladies and gentlemen—”\n\n      “Are my friends and keepers,” interupted Monsieur Maillard,\n      drawing himself up with _hauteur_,—“my very good friends and\r\nassistants.”\n\n      “What! all of them?” I asked,—“the women and all?”\n\n      “Assuredly,” he said,—“we could not do at all without the women;\n      they are the best lunatic nurses in the world; they have a way of\n      their own, you know; their bright eyes have a marvellous\n      effect—something like the fascination of the snake, you know.”\n\n      “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure! They behave a little odd,\n      eh?—they are a little queer, eh?—don’t you think so?”\n\n      “Odd!—queer!—why, do you really think so? We are not very\r\nprudish, to be sure, here in the South—do pretty much as we\n      please—enjoy life, and all that sort of thing, you know—”\n\n      “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure.”\n\n      “And then, perhaps, this Clos de Vougeot is a little heady, you\n      know—a little strong—you understand, eh?”\n\n      “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure. By the bye, Monsieur, did I\n      understand you to say that the system you have adopted, in place\n      of the celebrated soothing system, was one of very rigorous\n      severity?”\r\n“By no means. Our confinement is necessarily close; but the\n      treatment—the medical treatment, I mean—is rather agreeable to\n      the patients than otherwise.”\n\n      “And the new system is one of your own invention?”\n\n      “Not altogether. Some portions of it are referable to Professor\n      Tarr, of whom you have, necessarily, heard; and, again, there are\n      modifications in my plan which I am happy to acknowledge as\n      belonging of right to the celebrated Fether, with whom, if I\n      mistake not, you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance.”","“I am quite ashamed to confess,” I replied, “that I have never\n      even heard the names of either gentleman before.”\n\n      “Good heavens!” ejaculated my host, drawing back his chair\n      abruptly, and uplifting his hands. “I surely do not hear you\n      aright! You did not intend to say, eh? that you had never heard\n      either of the learned Doctor Tarr, or of the celebrated Professor\n      Fether?”\n\n      “I am forced to acknowledge my ignorance,” I replied; “but the\n      truth should be held inviolate above all things. Nevertheless, I\r\nfeel humbled to the dust, not to be acquainted with the works of\n      these, no doubt, extraordinary men. I will seek out their\n      writings forthwith, and peruse them with deliberate care.\n      Monsieur Maillard, you have really—I must confess it—you have\n      really—made me ashamed of myself!”\n\n      And this was the fact.\n\n      “Say no more, my good young friend,” he said kindly, pressing my\n      hand,—“join me now in a glass of Sauterne.”\n\n      We drank. The company followed our example without stint. They\n      chatted—they jested—they laughed—they perpetrated a thousand\r\nabsurdities—the fiddles shrieked—the drum row-de-dowed—the\n      trombones bellowed like so many brazen bulls of Phalaris—and the\n      whole scene, growing gradually worse and worse, as the wines\n      gained the ascendancy, became at length a sort of pandemonium in\n      petto. In the meantime, Monsieur Maillard and myself, with some\n      bottles of Sauterne and Vougeot between us, continued our\n      conversation at the top of the voice. A word spoken in an\n      ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice\r\nof a fish from the bottom of Niagara Falls.\n\n      “And, sir,” said I, screaming in his ear, “you mentioned\n      something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old\n      system of soothing. How is that?”\n\n      “Yes,” he replied, “there was, occasionally, very great danger\n      indeed. There is no accounting for the caprices of madmen; and,\n      in my opinion as well as in that of Dr. Tarr and Professor\n      Fether, it is never safe to permit them to run at large\n      unattended. A lunatic may be ‘soothed,’ as it is called, for a","time, but, in the end, he is very apt to become obstreperous. His\n      cunning, too, is proverbial and great. If he has a project in\n      view, he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom; and the\n      dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity, presents, to the\n      metaphysician, one of the most singular problems in the study of\n      mind. When a madman appears thoroughly sane, indeed, it is high\n      time to put him in a straitjacket.”\n\n      “But the danger, my dear sir, of which you were speaking, in your\r\nown experience—during your control of this house—have you had\n      practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a\n      lunatic?”\n\n      “Here?—in my own experience?—why, I may say, yes. For example:—no\n      very long while ago, a singular circumstance occurred in this\n      very house. The ‘soothing system,’ you know, was then in\n      operation, and the patients were at large. They behaved\n      remarkably well—especially so—any one of sense might have known\n      that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact,\r\nthat the fellows behaved so remarkably well. And, sure enough,\n      one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and\n      foot, and thrown into the cells, where they were attended, as if\n      they were the lunatics, by the lunatics themselves, who had\n      usurped the offices of the keepers.”\n\n      “You don’t tell me so! I never heard of any thing so absurd in my\n      life!”\n\n      “Fact—it all came to pass by means of a stupid fellow—a\n      lunatic—who, by some means, had taken it into his head that he\r\nhad invented a better system of government than any ever heard of\n      before—of lunatic government, I mean. He wished to give his\n      invention a trial, I suppose, and so he persuaded the rest of the\n      patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the\n      reigning powers.”\n\n      “And he really succeeded?”\n\n      “No doubt of it. The keepers and kept were soon made to exchange\n      places. Not that exactly either—for the madmen had been free, but\n      the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith, and treated, I am\n      sorry to say, in a very cavalier manner.”","“But I presume a counter-revolution was soon effected. This\n      condition of things could not have long existed. The country\n      people in the neighborhood—visitors coming to see the\n      establishment—would have given the alarm.”\n\n      “There you are out. The head rebel was too cunning for that. He\n      admitted no visitors at all—with the exception, one day, of a\n      very stupid-looking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to\n      be afraid. He let him in to see the place—just by way of\n      variety,—to have a little fun with him. As soon as he had\r\ngammoned him sufficiently, he let him out, and sent him about his\n      business.”\n\n      “And how long, then, did the madmen reign?”\n\n      “Oh, a very long time, indeed—a month certainly—how much longer I\n      can’t precisely say. In the meantime, the lunatics had a jolly\n      season of it—that you may swear. They doffed their own shabby\n      clothes, and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels. The\n      cellars of the château were well stocked with wine; and these\n      madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it. They lived\r\nwell, I can tell you.”\n\n      “And the treatment—what was the particular species of treatment\n      which the leader of the rebels put into operation?”\n\n      “Why, as for that, a madman is not necessarily a fool, as I have\n      already observed; and it is my honest opinion that his treatment\n      was a much better treatment than that which it superseded. It was\n      a very capital system indeed—simple—neat—no trouble at all—in\n      fact it was delicious—it was—”\n\n      Here my host’s observations were cut short by another series of\r\nyells, of the same character as those which had previously\n      disconcerted us. This time, however, they seemed to proceed from\n      persons rapidly approaching.\n\n      “Gracious heavens!” I ejaculated—“the lunatics have most\n      undoubtedly broken loose.”\n\n      “I very much fear it is so,” replied Monsieur Maillard, now\n      becoming excessively pale. He had scarcely finished the sentence,\n      before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the\n      windows; and, immediately afterward, it became evident that some","persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room.\n      The door was beaten with what appeared to be a sledge-hammer, and\n      the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence.\n\n      A scene of the most terrible confusion ensued. Monsieur Maillard,\n      to my excessive astonishment threw himself under the side-board.\n      I had expected more resolution at his hands. The members of the\n      orchestra, who, for the last fifteen minutes, had been seemingly\n      too much intoxicated to do duty, now sprang all at once to their\r\nfeet and to their instruments, and, scrambling upon their table,\n      broke out, with one accord, into, “Yankee Doodle,” which they\n      performed, if not exactly in tune, at least with an energy\n      superhuman, during the whole of the uproar.\n\n      Meantime, upon the main dining-table, among the bottles and\n      glasses, leaped the gentleman who, with such difficulty, had been\n      restrained from leaping there before. As soon as he fairly\n      settled himself, he commenced an oration, which, no doubt, was a\n      very capital one, if it could only have been heard. At the same\r\nmoment, the man with the teetotum predilection, set himself to\n      spinning around the apartment, with immense energy, and with arms\n      outstretched at right angles with his body; so that he had all\n      the air of a tee-totum in fact, and knocked everybody down that\n      happened to get in his way. And now, too, hearing an incredible\n      popping and fizzing of champagne, I discovered at length, that it\n      proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that\n      delicate drink during dinner. And then, again, the frog-man\r\ncroaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every\n      note that he uttered. And, in the midst of all this, the\n      continuous braying of a donkey arose over all. As for my old\n      friend, Madame Joyeuse, I really could have wept for the poor\n      lady, she appeared so terribly perplexed. All she did, however,\n      was to stand up in a corner, by the fireplace, and sing out\n      incessantly at the top of her voice, “Cock-a-doodle-de-dooooooh!”\n\n      And now came the climax—the catastrophe of the drama. As no","resistance, beyond whooping and yelling and cock-a-doodling, was\n      offered to the encroachments of the party without, the ten\n      windows were very speedily, and almost simultaneously, broken in.\n      But I shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with\n      which I gazed, when, leaping through these windows, and down\n      among us _pêle-mêle_, fighting, stamping, scratching, and\n      howling, there rushed a perfect army of what I took to be\n      chimpanzees, ourang-outangs, or big black baboons of the Cape of\n      Good Hope.\r\nI received a terrible beating—after which I rolled under a sofa\n      and lay still. After lying there some fifteen minutes, during\n      which time I listened with all my ears to what was going on in\n      the room, I came to same satisfactory _dénouement_ of this\n      tragedy. Monsieur Maillard, it appeared, in giving me the account\n      of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion, had been\n      merely relating his own exploits. This gentleman had, indeed,\n      some two or three years before, been the superintendent of the\r\nestablishment, but grew crazy himself, and so became a patient.\n      This fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced\n      me. The keepers, ten in number, having been suddenly overpowered,\n      were first well tarred, then carefully feathered, and then shut\n      up in underground cells. They had been so imprisoned for more\n      than a month, during which period Monsieur Maillard had\n      generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers (which\n      constituted his “system”), but some bread and abundance of water.\r\nThe latter was pumped on them daily. At length, one escaping\n      through a sewer, gave freedom to all the rest.\n\n      The “soothing system,” with important modifications, has been\n      resumed at the _château;_ yet I cannot help agreeing with\n      Monsieur Maillard, that his own “treatment” was a very capital\n      one of its kind. As he justly observed, it was “simple—neat—and\n      gave no trouble at all—not the least.”\n\n      I have only to add that, although I have searched every library\n      in Europe for the works of Doctor _Tarr_ and Professor _Fether_,","I have, up to the present day, utterly failed in my endeavors at\n      procuring an edition.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LITERARY LIFE OF THINGUM BOB, ESQ.\n\nLATE EDITOR OF THE “GOOSETHERUMFOODLE.”\nBy Himself\n\n\n      I am now growing in years, and—since I understand that\n      Shakespeare and Mr. Emmons are deceased—it is not impossible that\n      I may even die. It has occurred to me, therefore, that I may as\n      well retire from the field of Letters and repose upon my laurels.\n      But I am ambitious of signalizing my abdication of the literary\r\nsceptre by some important bequest to posterity; and, perhaps, I\n      cannot do a better thing than just pen for it an account of my\n      earlier career. My name, indeed, has been so long and so\n      constantly before the public eye, that I am not only willing to\n      admit the naturalness of the interest which it has everywhere\n      excited, but ready to satisfy the extreme curiosity which it has\n      inspired. In fact, it is no more than the duty of him who\n      achieves greatness to leave behind him, in his ascent, such\r\nlandmarks as may guide others to be great. I propose, therefore,\n      in the present paper, (which I had some idea of calling\n      “Memoranda to serve for the Literary History of America,”) to\n      give a detail of those important, yet feeble and tottering first\n      steps, by which, at length, I attained the high road to the\n      pinnacle of human renown.\n\n      Of one’s very remote ancestors it is superfluous to say much. My\n      father, Thomas Bob, Esq., stood for many years at the summit of\n      his profession, which was that of a merchant-barber, in the city\r\nof Smug. His warehouse was the resort of all the principal people\n      of the place, and especially of the editorial corps—a body which\n      inspires all about it with profound veneration and awe. For my\n      own part, I regarded them as gods, and drank in with avidity the\n      rich wit and wisdom which continuously flowed from their august\n      mouths during the process of what is styled “lather.” My first\n      moment of positive inspiration must be dated from that\n      ever-memorable epoch, when the brilliant conductor of the","“Gad-Fly,” in the intervals of the important process just\n      mentioned, recited aloud, before a conclave of our apprentices,\n      an inimitable poem in honor of the “Only Genuine Oil-of-Bob,” (so\n      called from its talented inventor, my father,) and for which\n      effusion the editor of the “Fly” was remunerated with a regal\n      liberality by the firm of Thomas Bob & company, merchant-barbers.\n\n      The genius of the stanzas to the “Oil-of-Bob” first breathed into\n      me, I say, the divine _afflatus_. I resolved at once to become a\r\ngreat man, and to commence by becoming a great poet. That very\n      evening I fell upon my knees at the feet of my father.\n\n      “Father,” I said, “pardon me!—but I have a soul above lather. It\n      is my firm intention to cut the shop. I would be an editor—I\n      would be a poet—I would pen stanzas to the ‘Oil-of-Bob.’ Pardon\n      me and aid me to be great!”\n\n      “My dear Thingum,” replied my father, (I had been christened\n      Thingum after a wealthy relative so surnamed,) “My dear Thingum,”\n      he said, raising me from my knees by the ears—“Thingum, my boy,\r\nyou’re a trump, and take after your father in having a soul. You\n      have an immense head, too, and it must hold a great many brains.\n      This I have long seen, and therefore had thoughts of making you a\n      lawyer. The business, however, has grown ungenteel, and that of a\n      politician don’t pay. Upon the whole you judge wisely;—the trade\n      of editor is best:—and if you can be a poet at the same time,—as\n      most of the editors are, by the by,—why you will kill two birds\n      with one stone. To encourage you in the beginning of things, I\r\nwill allow you a garret; pen, ink, and paper; a rhyming\n      dictionary; and a copy of the ‘Gad-Fly.’ I suppose you would\n      scarcely demand any more.”\n\n      “I would be an ungrateful villain if I did,” I replied with\n      enthusiasm. “Your generosity is boundless. I will repay it by\n      making you the father of a genius.”\n\n      Thus ended my conference with the best of men, and immediately\n      upon its termination, I betook myself with zeal to my poetical\n      labors; as upon these, chiefly, I founded my hopes of ultimate","elevation to the editorial chair.\n\n      In my first attempts at composition I found the stanzas to “The\n      Oil-of-Bob” rather a draw-back than otherwise. Their splendor\n      more dazzled than enlightened me. The contemplation of their\n      excellence tended, naturally, to discourage me by comparison with\n      my own abortions; so that for a long time I labored in vain. At\n      length there came into my head one of those exquisitely original\n      ideas which now and then _will_ permeate the brain of a man of\n      genius. It was this:—or, rather, thus was it carried into\r\nexecution. From the rubbish of an old book-stall, in a very\n      remote corner of the town, I got together several antique and\n      altogether unknown or forgotten volumes. The bookseller sold them\n      to me for a song. From one of these, which purported to be a\n      translation of one Dante’s “Inferno,” I copied with remarkable\n      neatness a long passage about a man named Ugolino, who had a\n      parcel of brats. From another which contained a good many old\n      plays by some person whose name I forget, I extracted in the same\r\nmanner, and with the same care, a great number of lines about\n      “angels” and “ministers saying grace,” and “goblins damned,” and\n      more besides of that sort. From a third, which was the\n      composition of some blind man or other, either a Greek or a\n      Choctaw—I cannot be at the pains of remembering every trifle\n      exactly—I took about fifty verses beginning with “Achilles’\n      wrath,” and “grease,” and something else. From a fourth, which I\n      recollect was also the work of a blind man, I selected a page or\r\ntwo all about “hail” and “holy light”; and although a blind man\n      has no business to write about light, still the verses were\n      sufficiently good in their way.\n\n      Having made fair copies of these poems, I signed every one of\n      them “Oppodeldoc,” (a fine sonorous name,) and, doing each up\n      nicely in a separate envelope, I despatched one to each of the\n      four principal Magazines, with a request for speedy insertion and\n      prompt pay. The result of this well conceived plan, however, (the\n      success of which would have saved me much trouble in after life,)","served to convince me that some editors are not to be bamboozled,\n      and gave the _coup-de-grace_ (as they say in France,) to my\n      nascent hopes, (as they say in the city of the transcendentals.)\n\n      The fact is, that each and every one of the Magazines in\n      question, gave Mr. “Oppodeldoc” a complete using-up, in the\n      “Monthly Notices to Correspondents.” The “Hum-Drum” gave him a\n      dressing after this fashion:\n\n      “‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has sent us a long _tirade_\n      concerning a bedlamite whom he styles ‘Ugolino,’ who had a great\r\nmany children that should have been all whipped and sent to bed\n      without their suppers. The whole affair is exceedingly tame—not\n      to say _flat_. ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is entirely devoid\n      of imagination—and imagination, in our humble opinion, is not\n      only the soul of Poesy, but also its very heart. ‘Oppodeldoc,’\n      (whoever he is,) has the audacity to demand of us, for his\n      twattle, a ‘speedy insertion and prompt pay.’ We neither insert\n      nor purchase any stuff of the sort. There can be no doubt,\r\nhowever, that he would meet with a ready sale for all the\n      balderdash he can scribble, at the office of either the\n      ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle.’”\n\n      All this, it must be acknowledged, was very severe upon\n      “Oppodeldoc”—but the unkindest cut was putting the word Poesy in\n      small caps. In those five pre-eminent letters what a world of\n      bitterness is there not involved!\n\n      But “Oppodeldoc” was punished with equal severity in the\n      “Rowdy-Dow,” which spoke thus:\r\n“We have received a most singular and insolent communication from\n      a person (whoever he is,) signing himself ‘Oppodeldoc’—thus\n      desecrating the greatness of the illustrious Roman Emperor so\n      named. Accompanying the letter of ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,)\n      we find sundry lines of most disgusting and unmeaning rant about\n      ‘angels and ministers of grace’—rant such as no madman short of a\n      Nat Lee, or an ‘Oppodeldoc,’ could possibly perpetrate. And for\n      this trash of trash, we are modestly requested to ‘pay promptly.’","No sir—no! We pay for nothing of _that_ sort. Apply to the\n      ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle.’ These\n      _periodicals_ will undoubtedly accept any literary offal you may\n      send them—and as undoubtedly _promise_ to pay for it.”\n\n      This was bitter indeed upon poor “Oppodeldoc”; but, in this\n      instance, the weight of the satire falls upon the “Hum-drum,” the\n      “Lollipop,” and the “Goosetherumfoodle,” who are pungently styled\n      “_periodicals_”—in Italics, too—a thing that must have cut them\n      to the heart.\r\nScarcely less savage was the “Lollipop,” which thus discoursed:\n\n      “Some _individual_, who rejoices in the appellation ‘Oppodeldoc,’\n      (to what low uses are the names of the illustrious dead too often\n      applied!) has enclosed us some fifty or sixty _verses_ commencing\n      after this fashion:\n\n      Achilles’ wrath, to Greece the direful spring\n      Of woes unnumbered, &c., &c., &c., &c.\n\n      “‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is respectfully informed that\n      there is not a printer’s devil in our office who is not in the\r\ndaily habit of composing better _lines_. Those of ‘Oppodeldoc’\n      will not _scan_. ‘Oppodeldoc’ should learn to _count_. But why he\n      should have conceived the idea that _we_, (of all others, _we!_)\n      would disgrace our pages with his ineffable nonsense, is utterly\n      beyond comprehension. Why, the absurd twattle is scarcely good\n      enough for the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ the\n      ‘Goosetherumfoodle’—things that are in the practice of publishing\n      ‘Mother Goose’s Melodies’ as original lyrics. And ‘Oppodeldoc’\r\n(whoever he is,) has even the assurance to demand _pay_ for this\n      drivel. Does ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) know—is he aware that\n      we could not be paid to insert it?”\n\n      As I perused this I felt myself growing gradually smaller and\n      smaller, and when I came to the point at which the editor sneered\n      at the poem as “verses” there was little more than an ounce of me\n      left. As for “Oppodeldoc,” I began to experience _compassion_ for\n      the poor fellow. But the “Goosetherumfoodle” showed, if possible,","less mercy than the “Lollipop.” It was the “Goosetherumfoodle”\n      that said:\n\n      “A wretched poetaster, who signs himself ‘Oppodeldoc,’ is silly\n      enough to fancy that _we_ will print and _pay for_ a medley of\n      incoherent and ungrammatical bombast which he has transmitted to\n      us, and which commences with the following most _intelligible_\n      line:\n\n      ‘Hail, Holy Light! Offspring of Heaven, first born.’\n\n      “We say, ‘most _intelligible_.’ ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,)\n      will be kind enough to tell us, perhaps, how ‘_hail_’ can be\r\n‘_holy light_’ We always regarded it as _frozen rain_. Will he\n      inform us, also, how frozen rain can be, at one and the same\n      time, both ‘holy light,’ (whatever that is,) and an\n      ‘offspring?’—which latter term, (if we understand any thing about\n      English,) is only employed, with propriety, in reference to small\n      babies of about six weeks old. But it is preposterous to descant\n      upon such absurdity—although ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has\n      the unparalleled effrontery to suppose that we will not only\r\n‘insert’ his ignorant ravings, but (absolutely) _pay for them!_\n\n      “Now this is fine—it is rich!—and we have half a mind to punish\n      this young scribbler for his egotism, by really publishing his\n      effusion, _verbatim et literatim_, as he has written it. We could\n      inflict no punishment so severe, and we _would_ inflict it, but\n      for the boredom which we should cause our readers in so doing.\n\n      “Let ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) send any future _composition_\n      of like character to the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the\r\n‘Rowdy-Dow,’ _They_ will ‘insert’ it. _They_ ‘insert’ every month\n      just such stuff. Send it to them. WE are not to be insulted with\n      impunity.”\n\n      This made an end of me; and as for the “Hum-Drum,” the\n      “Rowdy-Dow,” and the “Lollipop,” I never could comprehend how\n      they survived it. The putting _them_ in the smallest possible\n      _minion_, (that was the rub—thereby insinuating their\n      lowness—their baseness,) while WE stood looking down upon them in\n      gigantic capitals!—oh it was _too_ bitter!—it was wormwood—it was","gall. Had I been either of these periodicals I would have spared\n      no pains to have the “Goosetherumfoodle” prosecuted. It might\n      have been done under the Act for the “Prevention of Cruelty to\n      Animals.” As for “Oppodeldoc,” (whoever he was), I had by this\n      time lost all patience with the fellow, and sympathized with him\n      no longer. He was a fool, beyond doubt, (whoever he was,) and got\n      not a kick more than he deserved.\n\n      The result of my experiment with the old books, convinced me, in\n      the first place, that “honesty is the best policy,” and, in the\r\nsecond, that if I could not write better than Mr. Dante, and the\n      two blind men, and the rest of the old set, it would, at least,\n      be a difficult matter to write worse. I took heart, therefore,\n      and determined to prosecute the “entirely original,” (as they say\n      on the covers of the magazines,) at whatever cost of study and\n      pains. I again placed before my eyes, as a model, the brilliant\n      stanzas on “The Oil-of-Bob” by the editor of the “Gad-Fly,” and\n      resolved to construct an ode on the same sublime theme, in\r\nrivalry of what had already been done.\n\n      With my first verse I had no material difficulty. It ran thus:\n\n      “To pen an Ode upon the ‘Oil-of-Bob.’”\n\n      Having carefully looked out, however, all the legitimate rhymes\n      to “Bob,” I found it impossible to proceed. In this dilemma I had\n      recourse to paternal aid; and, after some hours of mature\n      thought, my father and myself thus constructed the poem:\n\n      _“To pen an Ode upon the ‘Oil-of-Bob’\n      Is all sorts of a job._\n                          “(Signed) Snob.”\r\nTo be sure, this composition was of no very great length—but I\n      “have yet to learn” as they say in the Edinburgh Review, that the\n      mere extent of a literary work has any thing to do with its\n      merit. As for the Quarterly cant about “sustained effort,” it is\n      impossible to see the sense of it. Upon the whole, therefore, I\n      was satisfied with the success of my maiden attempt, and now the\n      only question regarded the disposal I should make of it. My\n      father suggested that I should send it to the “Gad-Fly”—but there","were two reasons which operated to prevent me from so doing. I\n      dreaded the jealousy of the editor—and I had ascertained that he\n      did not pay for original contributions. I therefore, after due\n      deliberation, consigned the article to the more dignified pages\n      of the “Lollipop,” and awaited the event in anxiety, but with\n      resignation.\n\n      In the very next published number I had the proud satisfaction of\n      seeing my poem printed at length, as the leading article, with\r\nthe following significant words, prefixed in italics and between\n      brackets:\n\n      _We call the attention of our readers to the subjoined admirable\n      stanza on “The Oil of Bob.” We need say nothing of their\n      sublimity, or their pathos:—it is impossible to peruse them\n      without tears. Those who have been nauseated with a sad dose on\n      the same august topic from the goose quill of the editor of the\n      “Gad Fly” will do well to compare the two compositions._\n\n      P. S.—We are consumed with anxiety to probe the mystery which\r\nenvelops the evident pseudonym “Snob.” May we hope for a personal\n      interview?\n\n      All this was scarcely more than justice, but it was, I confess,\n      rather more than I had expected:—I acknowledged this, be it\n      observed, to the everlasting disgrace of my country and of\n      mankind. I lost no time, however, in calling upon the editor of\n      the “Lollipop,” and had the good fortune to find this gentleman\n      at home. He saluted me with an air of profound respect, slightly\n      blended with a fatherly and patronizing admiration, wrought in\r\nhim, no doubt, by my appearance of extreme youth and\n      inexperience. Begging me to be seated, he entered at once upon\n      the subject of my poem;—but modesty will ever forbid me to repeat\n      the thousand compliments which he lavished upon me. The eulogies\n      of Mr. Crab, (such was the editor’s name,) were, however, by no\n      means fulsomely indiscriminate. He analyzed my composition with\n      much freedom and great ability—not hesitating to point out a few\n      trivial defects—a circumstance which elevated him highly in my","esteem. The “Gad-Fly” was, of course, brought upon the _tapis_,\n      and I hope never to be subjected to a criticism so searching, or\n      to rebukes so withering, as were bestowed by Mr. Crab upon that\n      unhappy effusion. I had been accustomed to regard the editor of\n      the “Gad-Fly” as something superhuman; but Mr. Crab soon\n      disabused me of that idea. He set the literary as well as the\n      personal character of the Fly (so Mr. C. satirically designated\n      the rival editor,) in its true light. He, the Fly, was very\r\nlittle better than he should be. He had written infamous things.\n      He was a penny-a-liner, and a buffoon. He was a villain. He had\n      composed a tragedy which set the whole country in a guffaw, and a\n      farce which deluged the universe in tears. Besides all this, he\n      had the impudence to pen what he meant for a lampoon upon\n      himself, (Mr. Crab,) and the temerity to style him “an ass.”\n      Should I at any time wish to express my opinion of Mr. Fry, the\n      pages of the “Lollipop,” Mr. Crab assured me, were at my\r\nunlimited disposal. In the meantime, as it was very certain that\n      I would be attacked in the Fly for my attempt at composing a\n      rival poem on the “Oil-of-Bob,” he (Mr. Crab,) would take it upon\n      himself to attend, pointedly, to my private and personal\n      interests. If I were not made a man of at once, it should not be\n      the fault of himself, (Mr. Crab.)\n\n      Mr. Crab having now paused in his discourse, (the latter portion\n      of which I found it impossible to comprehend,) I ventured to\n      suggest something about the remuneration which I had been taught\r\nto expect for my poem, by an announcement on the cover of the\n      “Lollipop,” declaring that it, (the “Lollipop,”) “insisted upon\n      being permitted to pay exorbitant prices for all accepted\n      contributions—frequently expending more money for a single brief\n      poem than the whole annual cost of the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the\n      ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ and the ‘Goosetherumfoodle’ combined.”\n\n      As I mentioned the word “remuneration,” Mr. Crab first opened his\n      eyes, and then his mouth, to quite a remarkable extent; causing","his personal appearance to resemble that of a highly-agitated\n      elderly duck in the act of quacking; and in this condition he\n      remained, (ever and anon pressing his hands tightly to his\n      forehead, as if in a state of desperate bewilderment) until I had\n      nearly made an end of what I had to say.\n\n      Upon my conclusion, he sank back into his seat, as if much\n      overcome, letting his arms fall lifelessly by his side, but\n      keeping his mouth still rigorously open, after the fashion of the\n      duck. While I remained in speechless astonishment at behavior so\r\nalarming, he suddenly leaped to his feet and made a rush at the\n      bell-rope; but just as he reached this, he appeared to have\n      altered his intention, whatever it was, for he dived under a\n      table and immediately re-appeared with a cudgel. This he was in\n      the act of uplifting, (for what purpose I am at a loss to\n      imagine,) when, all at once, there came a benign smile over his\n      features, and he sank placidly back in his chair.\n\n      “Mr. Bob,” he said, (for I had sent up my card before ascending\r\nmyself,) “Mr. Bob, you are a young man, I presume—_very?_”\n\n      I assented; adding that I had not yet concluded my third lustrum.\n\n      “Ah!” he replied, “very good! I see how it is—say no more!\n      Touching this matter of compensation, what you observe is very\n      just: in fact it is excessively so. But ah—ah—the _first_\n      contribution—the _first_, I say,—it is never the Magazine custom\n      to pay for—you comprehend, eh? The truth is, we are usually the\n      _recipients_ in such case.” [Mr. Crab smiled blandly as he\n      emphasized the word “recipients.”] “For the most part, we are\r\n_paid_ for the insertion of a maiden attempt—especially in verse.\n      In the second place, Mr. Bob, the Magazine rule is never to\n      disburse what we term in France the _argent comptant_—I have no\n      doubt you understand. In a quarter or two after publication of\n      the article—or in a year or two—we make no objection to giving\n      our note at nine months; provided always that we can so arrange\n      our affairs as to be quite certain of a ‘burst up’ in six. I\n      really _do_ hope, Mr. Bob, that you will look upon this","explanation as satisfactory.” Here Mr. Crab concluded, and the\n      tears stood in his eyes.\n\n      Grieved to the soul at having been, however innocently, the cause\n      of pain to so eminent and so sensitive a man, I hastened to\n      apologize, and to reassure him, by expressing my perfect\n      coincidence with his views, as well as my entire appreciation of\n      the delicacy of his position. Having done all this in a neat\n      speech, I took leave.\n\n      One fine morning, very shortly afterwards, “I awoke and found\n      myself famous.” The extent of my renown will be best estimated by\r\nreference to the editorial opinions of the day. These opinions,\n      it will be seen, were embodied in critical notices of the number\n      of the “Lollipop” containing my poem, and are perfectly\n      satisfactory, conclusive and clear with the exception, perhaps,\n      of the hieroglyphical marks, “_Sep_. 15—1 t.” appended to each of\n      the critiques.\n\n      The “Owl,” a journal of profound sagacity, and well known for the\n      deliberate gravity of its literary decisions—the “Owl,” I say,\n      spoke as follows:\r\n“‘The Lollipop!’ The October number of this delicious Magazine\n      surpasses its predecessors, and sets competition at defiance. In\n      the beauty of its typography and paper—in the number and\n      excellence of its steel plates—as well as in the literary merit\n      of its contributions—the ‘Lollipop’ compares with its slow-paced\n      rivals as Hyperion with a Satyr. The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’\n      and the ‘Goosetherumfoodle,’ excel, it is true, in braggadocio,\n      but, in all other points, give us the ‘Lollipop!’ How this\r\ncelebrated journal can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses,\n      is more than we can understand. To be sure, it has a circulation\n      of 100,000, and its subscription-list has increased one-fourth\n      during the last month; but, on the other hand, the sums it\n      disburses constantly for contributions are inconceivable. It is\n      reported that Mr. Slyass received no less than thirty-seven and a\n      half cents for his inimitable paper on ‘Pigs.’ With Mr. Crab, as\n      editor, and with such names upon the list of contributors as Snob","and Slyass, there can be no such word as ‘fail’ for the\n      Lollipop.’ Go and subscribe. _Sep_. 15—1 _t.”_\n\n      I must say that I was gratified with this high-toned notice from\n      a paper so respectable as the “Owl.” The placing my name—that is\n      to say, my _nom de guerre_—in priority of station to that of the\n      great Slyass, was a compliment as happy as I felt it to be\n      deserved.\n\n      My attention was next arrested by these paragraphs in the\n      “Toad”—a print highly distinguished for its uprightness, and\r\nindependence—for its entire freedom from sycophancy and\n      subservience to the givers of dinners:\n\n      “The ‘Lollipop’ for October is out in advance of all its\n      contemporaries, and infinitely surpasses them, of course, in the\n      splendor of its embellishments, as well as in the richness of its\n      literary contents. The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ and the\n      ‘Goosetherumfoodle’ excel, we admit, in braggadocio, but, in all\n      other points, give us the ‘Lollipop. How this celebrated Magazine\r\ncan sustain its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we\n      can understand. To be sure, it has a circulation of 200,000, and\n      its subscription list has increased one-third during the last\n      fortnight, but on the other hand, the sums it disburses, monthly,\n      for contributions, are fearfully great. We learn that Mr.\n      Mumblethumb received no less than fifty cents for his late\n      ‘Monody in a Mud-Puddle.’\n\n      “Among the original contributors to the present number we notice,\n      (besides the eminent editor, Mr. Crab,) such men as Snob, Slyass,\r\nand Mumblethumb. Apart from the editorial matter, the most\n      valuable paper, nevertheless, is, we think, a poetical gem by\n      Snob, on the ‘Oil-of-Bob’—but our readers must not suppose from\n      the title of this incomparable _bijou_, that it bears any\n      similitude to some balderdash on the same subject by a certain\n      contemptible individual whose name is unmentionable to ears\n      polite. The present poem ‘On the Oil-of-Bob,’ has excited\n      universal anxiety and curiosity in respect to the owner of the","evident pseudonym, ‘Snob’—a curiosity which, happily, we have it\n      in our power to satisfy. ‘Snob’ is the nom de plume of Mr.\n      Thingum Bob, of this city,—a relative of the great Mr. Thingum,\n      (after whom he is named,) and otherwise connected with the most\n      illustrious families of the State. His father, Thomas Bob, Esq.,\n      is an opulent merchant in Smug. _Sep_. 15—1 _t.”_\n\n      This generous approbation touched me to the heart—the more\n      especially as it emanated from a source so avowedly—so\r\nproverbially pure as the “Toad.” The word “balderdash,” as\n      applied to the “Oil-of-Bob” of the Fly, I considered singularly\n      pungent and appropriate. The words “gem” and “_bijou_,” however,\n      used in reference to my composition, struck me as being, in some\n      degree, feeble, and seemed to me to be deficient in force. They\n      were not sufficiently _prononcés_, (as we have it in France).\n\n      I had hardly finished reading the “Toad,” when a friend placed in\n      my hands a copy of the “Mole,” a daily, enjoying high reputation\r\nfor the keenness of its perception about matters in general, and\n      for the open, honest, above-ground style of its editorials. The\n      “Mole” spoke of the “Lollipop” as follows:\n\n      “We have just received the ‘Lollipop’ for October, and must say\n      that never before have we perused any single number of any\n      periodical which afforded us a felicity so supreme. We speak\n      advisedly. The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow’ and the\n      ‘Goosetherumfoodle’ must look well to their laurels. These\n      prints, no doubt, surpass every thing in loudness of pretension,\r\nbut, in all other points, give us the ‘Lollipop!’ How this\n      celebrated Magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous\n      expenses, is more than we can comprehend. To be sure, it has a\n      circulation of 300,000 and its subscription-list has increased\n      one-half within the last week, but then the sum it disburses,\n      monthly, for contributions, is astoundingly enormous. We have it\n      upon good authority, that Mr. Fatquack received no less than\n      sixty-two cents and a half for his late domestic nouvelette, the\n      ‘Dish-Clout.’","“The contributors to the number before us are Mr. Crab, (the\n      eminent editor,) Snob, Mumblethumb, Fatquack, and others; but,\n      after the inimitable compositions of the editor himself, we\n      prefer a diamond-like effusion from the pen of a rising poet who\n      writes over the signature ‘Snob’—a nom de guerre which we predict\n      will one day extinguish the radiance of ‘Boz.’ ‘Snob,’ we learn,\n      is a Mr. Thingum Bob, Esq., sole heir of a wealthy merchant of\n      this city, Thomas Bob, Esq., and a near relative of the\r\ndistinguished Mr. Thingum. The title of Mr. B.‘s admirable poem\n      is the ‘Oil-of-Bob’—a somewhat unfortunate name, by-the-by, as\n      some contemptible vagabond connected with the penny press has\n      already disgusted the town with a great deal of drivel upon the\n      same topic. There will be no danger, however, of confounding the\n      compositions. Sep. 15—1 t.”\n\n      The generous approbation of so clear-sighted a journal as the\n      “Mole” penetrated my soul with delight. The only objection which\n      occurred to me was, that the terms “contemptible vagabond” might\r\nhave been better written “_odious and_ contemptible _wretch,\n      villain and_ vagabond.” This would have sounded more gracefully,\n      I think. “Diamond-like,” also, was scarcely, it will be admitted,\n      of sufficient intensity to express what the “Mole” evidently\n      _thought_ of the brilliancy of the “Oil-of-Bob.”\n\n      On the same afternoon in which I saw these notices in the “Owl,”\n      the “Toad,” and the “Mole” I happened to meet with a copy of the\n      “Daddy-Long-Legs,” a periodical proverbial for the extreme extent\r\nof its understanding. And it was the “Daddy-Long-Legs” which\n      spoke thus:\n\n      “The ‘Lollipop!!’ This gorgeous magazine is already before the\n      public for October. The question of preeminence is forever put to\n      rest, and hereafter it will be excessively preposterous in the\n      ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle,’ to make\n      any farther spasmodic attempts at competition. These journals may\n      excel the ‘Lollipop’ in outcry, but, in all other points, give us\n      the ‘Lollipop!’ How this celebrated Magazine can sustain its","evidently tremendous expenses, is past comprehension. To be sure\n      it has a circulation of precisely half a million, and its\n      subscription-list has increased seventy-five per cent, within the\n      last couple of days; but then the sums it disburses, monthly, for\n      contributions, are scarcely credible; we are cognizant of the\n      fact, that Mademoiselle Cribalittle received no less than\n      eighty-seven cents and a half for her late valuable Revolutionary\n      Tale, entitled ‘The York-Town Katy-Did, and the Bunker-Hill\n      Katy-Didn’t.’\r\n“The most able papers in the present number, are, of course,\n      those furnished by the editor, (the eminent Mr. Crab,) but there\n      are numerous magnificent contributions from such names as Snob,\n      Mademoiselle Cribalittle, Slyass, Mrs. Fibalittle, Mumblethumb,\n      Mrs. Squibalittle, and last, though not least, Fatquack. The\n      world may well be challenged to produce so rich a galaxy of\n      genius.\n\n      “The poem over the signature ‘Snob’ is, we find, attracting\n      universal commendation, and, we are constrained to say, deserves,\r\nif possible, even more applause than it has received. The\n      ‘Oil-of-Bob’ is the title of this masterpiece of eloquence and\n      art. One or two of our readers _may_ have a _very_ faint,\n      although sufficiently disgusting recollection of a poem (?)\n      similarly entitled, the perpetration of a miserable\n      penny-a-liner, mendicant, and cut-throat, connected in the\n      capacity of scullion, we believe, with one of the indecent prints\n      about the purlieus of the city; we beg them, for God’s sake, not\r\nto confound the compositions. The author of the ‘Oil-of-Bob’ is,\n      we hear, Thingum Bob, Esq., a gentleman of high genius, and a\n      scholar. ‘Snob’ is merely a _nom-de-guerre. Sept_. 15—1 _t.”_\n\n      I could scarcely restrain my indignation while I perused the\n      concluding portions of this diatribe. It was clear to me that the\n      yea-nay manner—not to say the gentleness—the positive forbearance\n      with which the “Daddy-Long-Legs” spoke of that pig, the editor of\n      the “Gad-Fly”—it was evident to me, I say, that this gentleness","of speech could proceed from nothing else than a partiality for\n      the Fly—whom it was clearly the intention of the\n      “Daddy-Long-Legs” to elevate into reputation at my expense. Any\n      one, indeed, might perceive, with half an eye, that, had the real\n      design of the “Daddy” been what it wished to appear, it, (the\n      “Daddy”) might have expressed itself in terms more direct, more\n      pungent, and altogether more to the purpose. The words\n      “penny-a-liner,” “mendicant,” “scullion,” and “cut-throat,” were\r\nepithets so intentionally inexpressive and equivocal, as to be\n      worse than nothing when applied to the author of the very worst\n      stanzas ever penned by one of the human race. We all know what is\n      meant by “damning with faint praise,” and, on the other hand, who\n      could fail seeing through the covert purpose of the “Daddy”—that\n      of glorifying with feeble abuse?\n\n      What the “Daddy” chose to say of the Fly, however, was no\n      business of mine. What it said of myself _was_. After the noble\n      manner in which the “Owl,” the “Toad,” the “Mole,” had expressed\r\nthemselves in respect to my ability, it was rather too much to be\n      coolly spoken of by a thing like the “Daddy-Long-Legs,” as merely\n      “a gentleman of high genius and a scholar.” Gentleman indeed! I\n      made up my mind at once, either to get a written apology from the\n      “Daddy-Long-Legs,” or to call it out.\n\n      Full of this purpose, I looked about me to find a friend whom I\n      could entrust with a message to his Daddyship, and as the editor\n      of the “Lollipop” had given me marked tokens of regard, I at\r\nlength concluded to seek assistance upon the present occasion.\n\n      I have never yet been able to account, in a manner satisfactory\n      to my own understanding, for the _very_ peculiar countenance and\n      demeanor with which Mr. Crab listened to me, as I unfolded to him\n      my design. He again went through the scene of the bell-rope and\n      cudgel, and did not omit the duck. At one period I thought he\n      really intended to quack. His fit, nevertheless, finally subsided\n      as before, and he began to act and speak in a rational way. He","declined bearing the cartel, however, and in fact, dissuaded me\n      from sending it at all; but was candid enough to admit that the\n      “Daddy-Long-Legs” had been disgracefully in the wrong—more\n      especially in what related to the epithets “gentleman and\n      scholar.”\n\n      Towards the end of this interview with Mr. Crab, who really\n      appeared to take a paternal interest in my welfare, he suggested\n      to me that I might turn an honest penny, and, at the same time,\n      advance my reputation, by occasionally playing Thomas Hawk for\r\nthe “Lollipop.”\n\n      I begged Mr. Crab to inform me who was Mr. Thomas Hawk, and how\n      it was expected that I should play him.\n\n      Here Mr. Crab again “made great eyes,” (as we say in Germany,)\n      but at length, recovering himself from a profound attack of\n      astonishment, he assured me that he employed the words “Thomas\n      Hawk” to avoid the colloquialism, Tommy, which was low—but that\n      the true idea was Tommy Hawk—or tomahawk—and that by “playing\n      tomahawk” he referred to scalping, brow-beating and otherwise\r\nusing-up the herd of poor-devil authors.\n\n      I assured my patron that, if this was all, I was perfectly\n      resigned to the task of playing Thomas Hawk. Hereupon Mr. Crab\n      desired me to use-up the editor of the “Gad-Fly” forthwith, in\n      the fiercest style within the scope of my ability, and as a\n      specimen of my powers. This I did, upon the spot, in a review of\n      the original “Oil-of-Bob,” occupying thirty-six pages of the\n      “Lollipop.” I found playing Thomas Hawk, indeed, a far less\n      onerous occupation than poetizing; for I went upon _system_\r\naltogether, and thus it was easy to do the thing thoroughly and\n      well. My practice was this. I bought auction copies (cheap) of\n      “Lord Brougham’s Speeches,” “Cobbett’s Complete Works,” the “New\n      Slang-Syllabus,” the “Whole Art of Snubbing,” “Prentice’s\n      Billingsgate” (folio edition,) and “Lewis G. Clarke on Tongue.”\n      These works I cut up thoroughly with a currycomb, and then,\n      throwing the shreds into a sieve, sifted out carefully all that\n      might be thought decent, (a mere trifle); reserving the hard","phrases, which I threw into a large tin pepper-castor with\n      longitudinal holes, so that an entire sentence could get through\n      without material injury. The mixture was then ready for use. When\n      called upon to play Thomas Hawk, I anointed a sheet of fools-cap\n      with the white of a gander’s egg; then, shredding the thing to be\n      reviewed as I had previously shredded the books,—only with more\n      care, so as to get every word separate—I threw the latter shreds\n      in with the former, screwed on the lid of the castor, gave it a\r\nshake, and so dusted out the mixture upon the egged foolscap;\n      where it stuck. The effect was beautiful to behold. It was\n      captivating. Indeed, the reviews I brought to pass by this simple\n      expedient have never been approached, and were the wonder of the\n      world. At first, through bashfulness—the result of inexperience—I\n      was a little put out by a certain inconsistency—a certain air of\n      the _bizarre_, (as we say in France,) worn by the composition as\n      a whole. All the phrases did not _fit_, (as we say in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon). Many were quite awry. Some, even, were\n      up-side-down; and there were none of them which were not, in some\n      measure, injured in regard to effect, by this latter species of\n      accident, when it occurred—with the exception of Mr. Lewis\n      Clarke’s paragraphs, which were so vigorous, and altogether\n      stout, that they seemed not particularly disconcerted by any\n      extreme of position, but looked equally happy and satisfactory,\n      whether on their heads, or on their heels.\r\nWhat became of the editor of the “Gad-Fly,” after the publication\n      of my criticism on his “Oil-of-Bob,” it is somewhat difficult to\n      determine. The most reasonable conclusion is, that he wept\n      himself to death. At all events he disappeared instantaneously\n      from the face of the earth, and no man has seen even the ghost of\n      him since.\n\n      This matter having been properly accomplished, and the Furies\n      appeased, I grew at once into high favor with Mr. Crab. He took\n      me into his confidence, gave me a permanent situation as Thomas","Hawk of the “Lollipop,” and, as for the present, he could afford\n      me no salary, allowed me to profit, at discretion, by his advice.\n\n      “My dear Thingum,” said he to me one day after dinner, “I respect\n      your abilities and love you as a son. You shall be my heir. When\n      I die I will bequeath you the ‘Lollipop.’ In the meantime I will\n      make a man of you—I _will_—provided always that you follow my\n      counsel. The first thing to do is to get rid of the old bore.”\n\n      “Boar?” said I inquiringly—“pig, eh?—_aper?_ (as we say in\r\nLatin)—who?—where?”\n\n      “Your father,” said he.\n\n      “Precisely,” I replied,—“pig.”\n\n      “You have your fortune to make, Thingum,” resumed Mr. Crab, “and\n      that governor of yours is a millstone about your neck. We must\n      cut him at once.” [Here I took out my knife.] “We must cut him,”\n      continued Mr. Crab, “decidedly and forever. He won’t do—he\n      _won’t_. Upon second thoughts, you had better kick him, or cane\n      him, or something of that kind.”\n\n      “What do you say,” I suggested modestly, “to my kicking him in\r\nthe first instance, caning him afterwards, and winding up by\n      tweaking his nose?”\n\n      Mr. Crab looked at me musingly for some moments, and then\n      answered:\n\n      “I think, Mr. Bob, that what you propose would answer\n      sufficiently well—indeed remarkably well—that is to say, as far\n      as it went—but barbers are exceedingly hard to cut, and I think,\n      upon the whole, that, having performed upon Thomas Bob the\n      operations you suggest, it would be advisable to blacken, with\n      your fists, both his eyes, very carefully and thoroughly, to\r\nprevent his ever seeing you again in fashionable promenades.\n      After doing this, I really do not perceive that you can do any\n      more. However—it might be just as well to roll him once or twice\n      in the gutter, and then put him in charge of the police. Any time\n      the next morning you can call at the watch-house and swear an\n      assault.”\n\n      I was much affected by the kindness of feeling towards me\n      personally, which was evinced in this excellent advice of Mr.\n      Crab, and I did not fail to profit by it forthwith. The result","was, that I got rid of the old bore, and began to feel a little\n      independent and gentleman-like. The want of money, however, was,\n      for a few weeks, a source of some discomfort; but at length, by\n      carefully putting to use my two eyes, and observing how matters\n      went just in front of my nose, I perceived how the thing was to\n      be brought about. I say “thing”—be it observed—for they tell me\n      the Latin for it is _rem_. By the way, talking of Latin, can any\n      one tell me the meaning of _quocunque_—or what is the meaning of\r\n_modo?_\n\n      My plan was exceedingly simple. I bought, for a song, a sixteenth\n      of the “Snapping-Turtle”:—that was all. The thing was _done_, and\n      I put money in my purse. There were some trivial arrangements\n      afterwards, to be sure; but these formed no portion of the plan.\n      They were a consequence—a result. For example, I bought pen, ink,\n      and paper, and put them into furious activity. Having thus\n      completed a Magazine article, I gave it, for appellation,\n      “Fol-Lol, _by the Author of_ ‘The Oil-of-Bob,’” and enveloped it\r\nto the “Goosetherumfoodle.” That journal, however, having\n      pronounced it “twattle” in the “Monthly Notices to\n      Correspondents,” I reheaded the paper “‘Hey-Diddle-Diddle,’ by\n      Thingum Bob, Esq., Author of the Ode on ‘The Oil-of-Bob,’ _and_\n      Editor of the ‘Snapping-Turtle.’” With this amendment, I\n      re-enclosed it to the “Goosetherumfoodle,” and, while I awaited a\n      reply, published daily, in the “Turtle,” six columns of what may\n      be termed philosophical and analytical investigation of the\r\nliterary merits of the “Goosetherumfoodle,” as well as of the\n      personal character of the editor of the “Goosetherumfoodle.” At\n      the end of a week the “Goosetherumfoodle” discovered that it had,\n      by some odd mistake, “confounded a stupid article, headed\n      ‘Hey-Diddle-Diddle’ and composed by some unknown ignoramus, with\n      a gem of resplendent lustre similarly entitled, the work of\n      Thingum Bob, Esq., the celebrated author of ‘The Oil-of-Bob.’”\n      The “Goosetherumfoodle” deeply “regretted this very natural","accident,” and promised, moreover, an insertion of the _genuine_\n      “Hey-Diddle-Diddle” in the very next number of the Magazine.\n\n      The fact is, I _thought_—I _really_ thought—I thought at the\n      time—I thought _then_—and have no reason for thinking otherwise\n      _now_—that the “Goosetherumfoodle” _did_ make a mistake. With the\n      best intentions in the world, I never knew any thing that made as\n      many singular mistakes as the “Goosetherumfoodle.” From that day\n      I took a liking to the “Goosetherumfoodle,” and the result was I\r\nsoon saw into the very depths of its literary merits, and did not\n      fail to expatiate upon them, in the “Turtle,” whenever a fitting\n      opportunity occurred. And it is to be regarded as a very peculiar\n      coincidence—as one of those positively _remarkable_ coincidences\n      which set a man to serious thinking—that just such a total\n      revolution of opinion—just such entire _bouleversement_, (as we\n      say in French,)—just such thorough _topsiturviness_, (if I may be\n      permitted to employ a rather forcible term of the Choctaws,) as\r\nhappened, _pro_ and _con_, between myself on the one part, and\n      the “Goosetherumfoodle” on the other, did actually again happen,\n      in a brief period afterwards, and with precisely similar\n      circumstances, in the case of myself and the “Rowdy-Dow,” and in\n      the case of myself and the “Hum-Drum.”\n\n      Thus it was that, by a master-stroke of genius, I at length\n      consummated my triumphs by “putting money in my purse,” and thus\n      may be said really and fairly to have commenced that brilliant\n      and eventful career which rendered me illustrious, and which now\r\nenables me to say, with Chateaubriand, “I have made\n      history”—“_J’ai fait l’histoire_.”\n\n      I have indeed “made history.” From the bright epoch which I now\n      record, my actions—my works—are the property of mankind. They are\n      familiar to the world. It is, then, needless for me to detail\n      how, soaring rapidly, I fell heir to the “Lollipop”—how I merged\n      this journal in the “Hum-Drum”—how again I made purchase of the\n      “Rowdy-Dow,” thus combining the three periodicals—how, lastly, I","effected a bargain for the sole remaining rival, and united all\n      the literature of the country in one magnificent Magazine, known\n      everywhere as the\n\n      “Rowdy-Dow, Lollipop, Hum-Drum,\n      and\n      goosetherumfoodle.”\n\n      Yes; I have made history. My fame is universal. It extends to the\n      uttermost ends of the earth. You cannot take up a common\n      newspaper in which you shall not see some allusion to the\n      immortal Thingum Bob. It is Mr. Thingum Bob said so, and Mr.\n      Thingum Bob wrote this, and Mr. Thingum Bob did that. But I am\r\nmeek and expire with an humble heart. After all, what is it?—this\n      indescribable something which men will persist in terming\n      “genius?” I agree with Buffon—with Hogarth—it is but _diligence_\n      after all.\n\n      Look at _me!_—how I labored—how I toiled—how I wrote! Ye Gods,\n      did I _not_ write? I knew not the word “ease.” By day I adhered\n      to my desk, and at night, a pale student, I consumed the midnight\n      oil. You should have seen me—you _should_. I leaned to the right.\n      I leaned to the left. I sat forward. I sat backward. I sat upon\r\nend. I sat _tete baissée_, (as they have it in the Kickapoo,)\n      bowing my head close to the alabaster page. And, through all,\n      I—_wrote_. Through joy and through sorrow, I—_wrote_. Through\n      hunger and through thirst, I—_wrote_. Through good report and\n      through ill report, I—_wrote_. Through sunshine and through\n      moonshine, I—_wrote. What_ I wrote it is unnecessary to say. The\n      _style!_—that was the thing. I caught it from\n      Fatquack—whizz!—fizz!—— and I am giving you a specimen of it now.\r\nHOW TO WRITE A “BLACKWOOD” ARTICLE\n\n\n      “In the name of the Prophet—figs!!”\n                    —_Cry of the Turkish fig-peddler._\n\n      I presume everybody has heard of me. My name is the Signora\n      Psyche Zenobia. This I know to be a fact. Nobody but my enemies\n      ever calls me Suky Snobbs. I have been assured that Suky is but a\n      vulgar corruption of Psyche, which is good Greek, and means “the\n      soul” (that’s me, I’m all soul) and sometimes “a butterfly,”\n      which latter meaning undoubtedly alludes to my appearance in my","new crimson satin dress, with the sky-blue Arabian mantelet, and\n      the trimmings of green agraffas, and the seven flounces of\n      orange-colored auriculas. As for Snobbs—any person who should\n      look at me would be instantly aware that my name wasn’t Snobbs.\n      Miss Tabitha Turnip propagated that report through sheer envy.\n      Tabitha Turnip indeed! Oh the little wretch! But what can we\n      expect from a turnip? Wonder if she remembers the old adage about\n      “blood out of a turnip,” &c.? [Mem. put her in mind of it the\r\nfirst opportunity.] [Mem. again—pull her nose.] Where was I? Ah!\n      I have been assured that Snobbs is a mere corruption of Zenobia,\n      and that Zenobia was a queen—(So am I. Dr. Moneypenny always\n      calls me the Queen of the Hearts)—and that Zenobia, as well as\n      Psyche, is good Greek, and that my father was “a Greek,” and that\n      consequently I have a right to our patronymic, which is Zenobia\n      and not by any means Snobbs. Nobody but Tabitha Turnip calls me\n      Suky Snobbs. I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia.\n\n      As I said before, everybody has heard of me. I am that very\r\nSignora Psyche Zenobia, so justly celebrated as corresponding\n      secretary to the “Philadelphia, Regular, Exchange, Tea, Total,\n      Young, Belles, Lettres, Universal, Experimental, Bibliographical,\n      Association, To, Civilize, Humanity.” Dr. Moneypenny made the\n      title for us, and says he chose it because it sounded big like an\n      empty rum-puncheon. (A vulgar man that sometimes—but he’s deep.)\n      We all sign the initials of the society after our names, in the\n      fashion of the R. S. A., Royal Society of Arts—the S. D. U. K.,\r\nSociety for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, &c, &c. Dr.\n      Moneypenny says that S. stands for stale, and that D. U. K.\n      spells duck, (but it don’t,) that S. D. U. K. stands for Stale\n      Duck and not for Lord Brougham’s society—but then Dr. Moneypenny\n      is such a queer man that I am never sure when he is telling me\n      the truth. At any rate we always add to our names the initials P.\n      R. E. T. T. Y. B. L. U. E. B. A. T. C. H.—that is to say,\n      Philadelphia, Regular, Exchange, Tea, Total, Young, Belles,","Lettres, Universal, Experimental, Bibliographical, Association,\n      To, Civilize, Humanity—one letter for each word, which is a\n      decided improvement upon Lord Brougham. Dr. Moneypenny will have\n      it that our initials give our true character—but for my life I\n      can’t see what he means.\n\n      Notwithstanding the good offices of the Doctor, and the strenuous\n      exertions of the association to get itself into notice, it met\n      with no very great success until I joined it. The truth is, the\n      members indulged in too flippant a tone of discussion. The papers\r\nread every Saturday evening were characterized less by depth than\n      buffoonery. They were all whipped syllabub. There was no\n      investigation of first causes, first principles. There was no\n      investigation of any thing at all. There was no attention paid to\n      that great point, the “fitness of things.” In short there was no\n      fine writing like this. It was all low—very! No profundity, no\n      reading, no metaphysics—nothing which the learned call\n      spirituality, and which the unlearned choose to stigmatize as\r\ncant. [Dr. M. says I ought to spell “cant” with a capital K—but I\n      know better.]\n\n      When I joined the society it was my endeavor to introduce a\n      better style of thinking and writing, and all the world knows how\n      well I have succeeded. We get up as good papers now in the P. R.\n      E. T. T. Y. B. L. U. E. B. A. T. C. H. as any to be found even in\n      Blackwood. I say, Blackwood, because I have been assured that the\n      finest writing, upon every subject, is to be discovered in the\n      pages of that justly celebrated Magazine. We now take it for our\r\nmodel upon all themes, and are getting into rapid notice\n      accordingly. And, after all, it’s not so very difficult a matter\n      to compose an article of the genuine Blackwood stamp, if one only\n      goes properly about it. Of course I don’t speak of the political\n      articles. Everybody knows how they are managed, since Dr.\n      Moneypenny explained it. Mr. Blackwood has a pair of\n      tailor’s-shears, and three apprentices who stand by him for\n      orders. One hands him the “Times,” another the “Examiner” and a","third a “Culley’s New Compendium of Slang-Whang.” Mr. B. merely\n      cuts out and intersperses. It is soon done—nothing but\n      “Examiner,” “Slang-Whang,” and “Times”—then “Times,”\n      “Slang-Whang,” and “Examiner”—and then “Times,” “Examiner,” and\n      “Slang-Whang.”\n\n      But the chief merit of the Magazine lies in its miscellaneous\n      articles; and the best of these come under the head of what Dr.\n      Moneypenny calls the bizarreries (whatever that may mean) and\n      what everybody else calls the intensities. This is a species of\r\nwriting which I have long known how to appreciate, although it is\n      only since my late visit to Mr. Blackwood (deputed by the\n      society) that I have been made aware of the exact method of\n      composition. This method is very simple, but not so much so as\n      the politics. Upon my calling at Mr. B.‘s, and making known to\n      him the wishes of the society, he received me with great\n      civility, took me into his study, and gave me a clear explanation\n      of the whole process.\n\n      “My dear madam,” said he, evidently struck with my majestic\r\nappearance, for I had on the crimson satin, with the green\n      agraffas, and orange-colored auriclas. “My dear madam,” said he,\n      “sit down. The matter stands thus: In the first place your writer\n      of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big pen, with\n      a very blunt nib. And, mark me, Miss Psyche Zenobia!” he\n      continued, after a pause, with the most expressive energy and\n      solemnity of manner, “mark me!—that pen—must—never be mended!\n      Herein, madam, lies the secret, the soul, of intensity. I assume\r\nupon myself to say, that no individual, of however great genius\n      ever wrote with a good pen—understand me,—a good article. You may\n      take, it for granted, that when manuscript can be read it is\n      never worth reading. This is a leading principle in our faith, to\n      which if you cannot readily assent, our conference is at an end.”\n\n      He paused. But, of course, as I had no wish to put an end to the\n      conference, I assented to a proposition so very obvious, and one,\n      too, of whose truth I had all along been sufficiently aware. He","seemed pleased, and went on with his instructions.\n\n      “It may appear invidious in me, Miss Psyche Zenobia, to refer you\n      to any article, or set of articles, in the way of model or study,\n      yet perhaps I may as well call your attention to a few cases. Let\n      me see. There was ‘The Dead Alive,’ a capital thing!—the record\n      of a gentleman’s sensations when entombed before the breath was\n      out of his body—full of tastes, terror, sentiment, metaphysics,\n      and erudition. You would have sworn that the writer had been born\r\nand brought up in a coffin. Then we had the ‘Confessions of an\n      Opium-eater’—fine, very fine!—glorious imagination—deep\n      philosophy acute speculation—plenty of fire and fury, and a good\n      spicing of the decidedly unintelligible. That was a nice bit of\n      flummery, and went down the throats of the people delightfully.\n      They would have it that Coleridge wrote the paper—but not so. It\n      was composed by my pet baboon, Juniper, over a rummer of Hollands\n      and water, ‘hot, without sugar.’” [This I could scarcely have\r\nbelieved had it been anybody but Mr. Blackwood, who assured me of\n      it.] “Then there was ‘The Involuntary Experimentalist,’ all about\n      a gentleman who got baked in an oven, and came out alive and\n      well, although certainly done to a turn. And then there was ‘The\n      Diary of a Late Physician,’ where the merit lay in good rant, and\n      indifferent Greek—both of them taking things with the public. And\n      then there was ‘The Man in the Bell,’ a paper by-the-by, Miss\n      Zenobia, which I cannot sufficiently recommend to your attention.\r\nIt is the history of a young person who goes to sleep under the\n      clapper of a church bell, and is awakened by its tolling for a\n      funeral. The sound drives him mad, and, accordingly, pulling out\n      his tablets, he gives a record of his sensations. Sensations are\n      the great things after all. Should you ever be drowned or hung,\n      be sure and make a note of your sensations—they will be worth to\n      you ten guineas a sheet. If you wish to write forcibly, Miss\n      Zenobia, pay minute attention to the sensations.”","“That I certainly will, Mr. Blackwood,” said I.\n\n      “Good!” he replied. “I see you are a pupil after my own heart.\n      But I must put you au fait to the details necessary in composing\n      what may be denominated a genuine Blackwood article of the\n      sensation stamp—the kind which you will understand me to say I\n      consider the best for all purposes.\n\n      “The first thing requisite is to get yourself into such a scrape\n      as no one ever got into before. The oven, for instance,—that was\r\na good hit. But if you have no oven or big bell, at hand, and if\n      you cannot conveniently tumble out of a balloon, or be swallowed\n      up in an earthquake, or get stuck fast in a chimney, you will\n      have to be contented with simply imagining some similar\n      misadventure. I should prefer, however, that you have the actual\n      fact to bear you out. Nothing so well assists the fancy, as an\n      experimental knowledge of the matter in hand. ‘Truth is strange,’\n      you know, ‘stranger than fiction’—besides being more to the\n      purpose.”\r\nHere I assured him I had an excellent pair of garters, and would\n      go and hang myself forthwith.\n\n      “Good!” he replied, “do so;—although hanging is somewhat\n      hacknied. Perhaps you might do better. Take a dose of Brandreth’s\n      pills, and then give us your sensations. However, my instructions\n      will apply equally well to any variety of misadventure, and in\n      your way home you may easily get knocked in the head, or run over\n      by an omnibus, or bitten by a mad dog, or drowned in a gutter.\n      But to proceed.\r\n“Having determined upon your subject, you must next consider the\n      tone, or manner, of your narration. There is the tone didactic,\n      the tone enthusiastic, the tone natural—all commonplace enough.\n      But then there is the tone laconic, or curt, which has lately\n      come much into use. It consists in short sentences. Somehow thus:\n      Can’t be too brief. Can’t be too snappish. Always a full stop.\n      And never a paragraph.\n\n      “Then there is the tone elevated, diffusive, and interjectional.\n      Some of our best novelists patronize this tone. The words must be","all in a whirl, like a humming-top, and make a noise very\n      similar, which answers remarkably well instead of meaning. This\n      is the best of all possible styles where the writer is in too\n      great a hurry to think.\n\n      “The tone metaphysical is also a good one. If you know any big\n      words this is your chance for them. Talk of the Ionic and Eleatic\n      schools—of Archytas, Gorgias, and Alcmaeon. Say something about\n      objectivity and subjectivity. Be sure and abuse a man named\n      Locke. Turn up your nose at things in general, and when you let\r\nslip any thing a little too absurd, you need not be at the\n      trouble of scratching it out, but just add a footnote and say\n      that you are indebted for the above profound observation to the\n      ‘Kritik der reinem Vernunft,’ or to the ‘Metaphysithe\n      Anfongsgrunde der Noturwissenchaft.’ This would look erudite\n      and—and—and frank.\n\n      “There are various other tones of equal celebrity, but I shall\n      mention only two more—the tone transcendental and the tone\n      heterogeneous. In the former the merit consists in seeing into\r\nthe nature of affairs a very great deal farther than anybody\n      else. This second sight is very efficient when properly managed.\n      A little reading of the ‘Dial’ will carry you a great way.\n      Eschew, in this case, big words; get them as small as possible,\n      and write them upside down. Look over Channing’s poems and quote\n      what he says about a ‘fat little man with a delusive show of\n      Can.’ Put in something about the Supernal Oneness. Don’t say a\n      syllable about the Infernal Twoness. Above all, study innuendo.\r\nHint everything—assert nothing. If you feel inclined to say\n      ‘bread and butter,’ do not by any means say it outright. You may\n      say any thing and every thing approaching to ‘bread and butter.’\n      You may hint at buck-wheat cake, or you may even go so far as to\n      insinuate oat-meal porridge, but if bread and butter be your real\n      meaning, be cautious, my dear Miss Psyche, not on any account to\n      say ‘bread and butter!’”\n\n      I assured him that I should never say it again as long as I\n      lived. He kissed me and continued:","“As for the tone heterogeneous, it is merely a judicious mixture,\n      in equal proportions, of all the other tones in the world, and is\n      consequently made up of every thing deep, great, odd, piquant,\n      pertinent, and pretty.\n\n      “Let us suppose now you have determined upon your incidents and\n      tone. The most important portion—in fact, the soul of the whole\n      business, is yet to be attended to—I allude to the filling up. It\n      is not to be supposed that a lady, or gentleman either, has been\r\nleading the life of a book worm. And yet above all things it is\n      necessary that your article have an air of erudition, or at least\n      afford evidence of extensive general reading. Now I’ll put you in\n      the way of accomplishing this point. See here!” (pulling down\n      some three or four ordinary-looking volumes, and opening them at\n      random). “By casting your eye down almost any page of any book in\n      the world, you will be able to perceive at once a host of little\n      scraps of either learning or _bel-esprit-ism_, which are the very\r\nthing for the spicing of a Blackwood article. You might as well\n      note down a few while I read them to you. I shall make two\n      divisions: first, Piquant Facts for the Manufacture of Similes,\n      and, second, Piquant Expressions to be introduced as occasion may\n      require. Write now!”—and I wrote as he dictated.\n\n      “PIQUANT FACTS FOR SIMILES. ‘There were originally but three\n      Muses—Melete, Mneme, Aœde—meditation, memory, and singing.’ You\n      may make a good deal of that little fact if properly worked. You\r\nsee it is not generally known, and looks _recherché_. You must be\n      careful and give the thing with a downright improviso air.\n\n      “Again. ‘The river Alpheus passed beneath the sea, and emerged\n      without injury to the purity of its waters.’ Rather stale that,\n      to be sure, but, if properly dressed and dished up, will look\n      quite as fresh as ever.\n\n      “Here is something better. ‘The Persian Iris appears to some\n      persons to possess a sweet and very powerful perfume, while to\n      others it is perfectly scentless.’ Fine that, and very delicate!","Turn it about a little, and it will do wonders. We’ll have some\n      thing else in the botanical line. There’s nothing goes down so\n      well, especially with the help of a little Latin. Write!\n\n      “‘_The Epidendrum Flos Aeris_, of Java, bears a very beautiful\n      flower, and will live when pulled up by the roots. The natives\n      suspend it by a cord from the ceiling, and enjoy its fragrance\n      for years.’ That’s capital! That will do for the similes. Now for\n      the Piquant Expressions.\n\n      “PIQUANT EXPRESSIONS. ‘_The Venerable Chinese novel Ju-Kiao-Li_.’\r\nGood! By introducing these few words with dexterity you will\n      evince your intimate acquaintance with the language and\n      literature of the Chinese. With the aid of this you may either\n      get along without either Arabic, or Sanscrit, or Chickasaw. There\n      is no passing muster, however, without Spanish, Italian, German,\n      Latin, and Greek. I must look you out a little specimen of each.\n      Any scrap will answer, because you must depend upon your own\n      ingenuity to make it fit into your article. Now write!\r\n“‘_Aussi tendre que Zaire_’—as tender as Zaire-French. Alludes to\n      the frequent repetition of the phrase, _la tendre Zaire_, in the\n      French tragedy of that name. Properly introduced, will show not\n      only your knowledge of the language, but your general reading and\n      wit. You can say, for instance, that the chicken you were eating\n      (write an article about being choked to death by a chicken-bone)\n      was not altogether _aussi tendre que Zaire_. Write!\n\n‘Van muerte tan escondida,\n    Que no te sienta venir,\nPorque el plazer del morir,\r\nNo mestorne a dar la vida.’\n\n      “That’s Spanish—from Miguel de Cervantes. ‘Come quickly, O death!\n      but be sure and don’t let me see you coming, lest the pleasure I\n      shall feel at your appearance should unfortunately bring me back\n      again to life.’ This you may slip in quite a propos when you are\n      struggling in the last agonies with the chicken-bone. Write!\n\n      ‘Il pover ‘huomo che non se’n era accorto,\n      Andava combattendo, e era morto.‘\n\n      “That’s Italian, you perceive—from Ariosto. It means that a great","hero, in the heat of combat, not perceiving that he had been\n      fairly killed, continued to fight valiantly, dead as he was. The\n      application of this to your own case is obvious—for I trust, Miss\n      Psyche, that you will not neglect to kick for at least an hour\n      and a half after you have been choked to death by that\n      chicken-bone. Please to write!\n\n      ‘Und sterb’ich doch, no sterb’ich denn\n      Durch sie—durch sie!’’\n\n      “That’s German—from Schiller. ‘And if I die, at least I die—for\n      thee—for thee!’ Here it is clear that you are apostrophizing the\r\ncause of your disaster, the chicken. Indeed what gentleman (or\n      lady either) of sense, wouldn’t die, I should like to know, for a\n      well fattened capon of the right Molucca breed, stuffed with\n      capers and mushrooms, and served up in a salad-bowl, with\n      orange-jellies _en mosaïques_. Write! (You can get them that way\n      at Tortoni’s)—Write, if you please!\n\n      “Here is a nice little Latin phrase, and rare too, (one can’t be\n      too _recherché_ or brief in one’s Latin, it’s getting so\r\ncommon—ignoratio elenchi. He has committed an ignoratio\n      elenchi—that is to say, he has understood the words of your\n      proposition, but not the idea. The man was a fool, you see. Some\n      poor fellow whom you address while choking with that\n      chicken-bone, and who therefore didn’t precisely understand what\n      you were talking about. Throw the ignoratio elenchi in his teeth,\n      and, at once, you have him annihilated. If he dares to reply, you\n      can tell him from Lucan (here it is) that speeches are mere\r\nanemonae verborum, anemone words. The anemone, with great\n      brilliancy, has no smell. Or, if he begins to bluster, you may be\n      down upon him with insomnia Jovis, reveries of Jupiter—a phrase\n      which Silius Italicus (see here!) applies to thoughts pompous and\n      inflated. This will be sure and cut him to the heart. He can do\n      nothing but roll over and die. Will you be kind enough to write?\n\n      “In Greek we must have some thing pretty—from Demosthenes, for\n      example. Ανερο φευων και παλιν μαχεσεται.

He’ll take\n      the hint and be off, you may depend upon it.”\n\n      These were all the instructions Mr. B. could afford me upon the\n      topic in question, but I felt they would be entirely sufficient.\n      I was, at length, able to write a genuine Blackwood article, and\r\ndetermined to do it forthwith. In taking leave of me, Mr. B. made\n      a proposition for the purchase of the paper when written; but as\n      he could offer me only fifty guineas a sheet, I thought it better\n      to let our society have it, than sacrifice it for so paltry a\n      sum. Notwithstanding this niggardly spirit, however, the\n      gentleman showed his consideration for me in all other respects,\n      and indeed treated me with the greatest civility. His parting\n      words made a deep impression upon my heart, and I hope I shall\r\nalways remember them with gratitude.\n\n      “My dear Miss Zenobia,” he said, while the tears stood in his\n      eyes, “is there anything else I can do to promote the success of\n      your laudable undertaking? Let me reflect! It is just possible\n      that you may not be able, so soon as convenient, to—to—get\n      yourself drowned, or—choked with a chicken-bone, or—or\n      hung,—or—bitten by a—but stay! Now I think me of it, there are a\n      couple of very excellent bull-dogs in the yard—fine fellows, I\n      assure you—savage, and all that—indeed just the thing for your","money—they’ll have you eaten up, auricula and all, in less than\n      five minutes (here’s my watch!)—and then only think of the\n      sensations! Here! I say—Tom!—Peter!—Dick, you villain!—let out\n      those”—but as I was really in a great hurry, and had not another\n      moment to spare, I was reluctantly forced to expedite my\n      departure, and accordingly took leave at once—somewhat more\n      abruptly, I admit, than strict courtesy would have otherwise\n      allowed.\n\n      It was my primary object upon quitting Mr. Blackwood, to get into\r\nsome immediate difficulty, pursuant to his advice, and with this\n      view I spent the greater part of the day in wandering about\n      Edinburgh, seeking for desperate adventures—adventures adequate\n      to the intensity of my feelings, and adapted to the vast\n      character of the article I intended to write. In this excursion I\n      was attended by one negro servant, Pompey, and my little lap-dog\n      Diana, whom I had brought with me from Philadelphia. It was not,\n      however, until late in the afternoon that I fully succeeded in my\r\narduous undertaking. An important event then happened of which\n      the following Blackwood article, in the tone heterogeneous, is\n      the substance and result.\n\n\n\n\nA PREDICAMENT\n\n\nWhat chance, good lady, hath bereft you thus?—COMUS.\n\n      It was a quiet and still afternoon when I strolled forth in the\n      goodly city of Edina. The confusion and bustle in the streets\n      were terrible. Men were talking. Women were screaming. Children\n      were choking. Pigs were whistling. Carts they rattled. Bulls they\n      bellowed. Cows they lowed. Horses they neighed. Cats they\r\ncaterwauled. Dogs they danced. _Danced!_ Could it then be\n      possible? Danced! Alas, thought I, my dancing days are over! Thus\n      it is ever. What a host of gloomy recollections will ever and\n      anon be awakened in the mind of genius and imaginative\n      contemplation, especially of a genius doomed to the everlasting,\n      and eternal, and continual, and, as one might say,\n      the—continued—yes, the continued and continuous, bitter,\n      harassing, disturbing, and, if I may be allowed the expression,","the very disturbing influence of the serene, and godlike, and\n      heavenly, and exalted, and elevated, and purifying effect of what\n      may be rightly termed the most enviable, the most truly\n      enviable—nay! the most benignly beautiful, the most deliciously\n      ethereal, and, as it were, the most pretty (if I may use so bold\n      an expression) thing (pardon me, gentle reader!) in the world—but\n      I am always led away by my feelings. In such a mind, I repeat,\n      what a host of recollections are stirred up by a trifle! The dogs\r\ndanced! I—I could not! They frisked—I wept. They capered—I sobbed\n      aloud. Touching circumstances! which cannot fail to bring to the\n      recollection of the classical reader that exquisite passage in\n      relation to the fitness of things, which is to be found in the\n      commencement of the third volume of that admirable and venerable\n      Chinese novel the Jo-Go-Slow.\n\n      In my solitary walk through, the city I had two humble but\n      faithful companions. Diana, my poodle! sweetest of creatures! She\r\nhad a quantity of hair over her one eye, and a blue ribbon tied\n      fashionably around her neck. Diana was not more than five inches\n      in height, but her head was somewhat bigger than her body, and\n      her tail being cut off exceedingly close, gave an air of injured\n      innocence to the interesting animal which rendered her a favorite\n      with all.\n\n      And Pompey, my negro!—sweet Pompey! how shall I ever forget thee?\n      I had taken Pompey’s arm. He was three feet in height (I like to\n      be particular) and about seventy, or perhaps eighty, years of\r\nage. He had bow-legs and was corpulent. His mouth should not be\n      called small, nor his ears short. His teeth, however, were like\n      pearl, and his large full eyes were deliciously white. Nature had\n      endowed him with no neck, and had placed his ankles (as usual\n      with that race) in the middle of the upper portion of the feet.\n      He was clad with a striking simplicity. His sole garments were a\n      stock of nine inches in height, and a nearly-new drab overcoat\n      which had formerly been in the service of the tall, stately, and","illustrious Dr. Moneypenny. It was a good overcoat. It was well\n      cut. It was well made. The coat was nearly new. Pompey held it up\n      out of the dirt with both hands.\n\n      There were three persons in our party, and two of them have\n      already been the subject of remark. There was a third—that person\n      was myself. I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia. I am not Suky\n      Snobbs. My appearance is commanding. On the memorable occasion of\n      which I speak I was habited in a crimson satin dress, with a\n      sky-blue Arabian mantelet. And the dress had trimmings of green\r\nagraffas, and seven graceful flounces of the orange-colored\n      auricula. I thus formed the third of the party. There was the\n      poodle. There was Pompey. There was myself. We were three. Thus\n      it is said there were originally but three Furies—Melty, Nimmy,\n      and Hetty—Meditation, Memory, and Fiddling.\n\n      Leaning upon the arm of the gallant Pompey, and attended at a\n      respectable distance by Diana, I proceeded down one of the\n      populous and very pleasant streets of the now deserted Edina. On\r\na sudden, there presented itself to view a church—a Gothic\n      cathedral—vast, venerable, and with a tall steeple, which towered\n      into the sky. What madness now possessed me? Why did I rush upon\n      my fate? I was seized with an uncontrollable desire to ascend the\n      giddy pinnacle, and then survey the immense extent of the city.\n      The door of the cathedral stood invitingly open. My destiny\n      prevailed. I entered the ominous archway. Where then was my\n      guardian angel?—if indeed such angels there be. If! Distressing\r\nmonosyllable! what world of mystery, and meaning, and doubt, and\n      uncertainty is there involved in thy two letters! I entered the\n      ominous archway! I entered; and, without injury to my\n      orange-colored auriculas, I passed beneath the portal, and\n      emerged within the vestibule. Thus it is said the immense river\n      Alfred passed, unscathed, and unwetted, beneath the sea.\n\n      I thought the staircase would never have an end. Round! Yes, they\n      went round and up, and round and up and round and up, until I","could not help surmising, with the sagacious Pompey, upon whose\n      supporting arm I leaned in all the confidence of early\n      affection—I could not help surmising that the upper end of the\n      continuous spiral ladder had been accidentally, or perhaps\n      designedly, removed. I paused for breath; and, in the meantime,\n      an accident occurred of too momentous a nature in a moral, and\n      also in a metaphysical point of view, to be passed over without\n      notice. It appeared to me—indeed I was quite confident of the\n      fact—I could not be mistaken—no! I had, for some moments,\r\ncarefully and anxiously observed the motions of my Diana—I say\n      that I could not be mistaken—Diana smelt a rat! At once I called\n      Pompey’s attention to the subject, and he—he agreed with me.\n      There was then no longer any reasonable room for doubt. The rat\n      had been smelled—and by Diana. Heavens! shall I ever forget the\n      intense excitement of the moment? Alas! what is the boasted\n      intellect of man? The rat!—it was there—that is to say, it was\n      somewhere. Diana smelled the rat. I—I could not! Thus it is said\r\nthe Prussian Isis has, for some persons, a sweet and very\n      powerful perfume, while to others it is perfectly scentless.\n\n      The staircase had been surmounted, and there were now only three\n      or four more upward steps intervening between us and the summit.\n      We still ascended, and now only one step remained. One step! One\n      little, little step! Upon one such little step in the great\n      staircase of human life how vast a sum of human happiness or\n      misery depends! I thought of myself, then of Pompey, and then of\r\nthe mysterious and inexplicable destiny which surrounded us. I\n      thought of Pompey!—alas, I thought of love! I thought of my many\n      false steps which have been taken, and may be taken again. I\n      resolved to be more cautious, more reserved. I abandoned the arm\n      of Pompey, and, without his assistance, surmounted the one\n      remaining step, and gained the chamber of the belfry. I was\n      followed immediately afterward by my poodle. Pompey alone\n      remained behind. I stood at the head of the staircase, and","encouraged him to ascend. He stretched forth to me his hand, and\n      unfortunately in so doing was forced to abandon his firm hold\n      upon the overcoat. Will the gods never cease their persecution?\n      The overcoat is dropped, and, with one of his feet, Pompey\n      stepped upon the long and trailing skirt of the overcoat. He\n      stumbled and fell—this consequence was inevitable. He fell\n      forward, and, with his accursed head, striking me full in the—in\n      the breast, precipitated me headlong, together with himself, upon\r\nthe hard, filthy, and detestable floor of the belfry. But my\n      revenge was sure, sudden, and complete. Seizing him furiously by\n      the wool with both hands, I tore out a vast quantity of black,\n      and crisp, and curling material, and tossed it from me with every\n      manifestation of disdain. It fell among the ropes of the belfry\n      and remained. Pompey arose, and said no word. But he regarded me\n      piteously with his large eyes and—sighed. Ye Gods—that sigh! It\n      sunk into my heart. And the hair—the wool! Could I have reached\r\nthat wool I would have bathed it with my tears, in testimony of\n      regret. But alas! it was now far beyond my grasp. As it dangled\n      among the cordage of the bell, I fancied it alive. I fancied that\n      it stood on end with indignation. Thus the happy-dandy Flos Aeris\n      of Java bears, it is said, a beautiful flower, which will live\n      when pulled up by the roots. The natives suspend it by a cord\n      from the ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years.\n\n      Our quarrel was now made up, and we looked about the room for an\r\naperture through which to survey the city of Edina. Windows there\n      were none. The sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber\n      proceeded from a square opening, about a foot in diameter, at a\n      height of about seven feet from the floor. Yet what will the\n      energy of true genius not effect? I resolved to clamber up to\n      this hole. A vast quantity of wheels, pinions, and other\n      cabalistic-looking machinery stood opposite the hole, close to\n      it; and through the hole there passed an iron rod from the\n      machinery. Between the wheels and the wall where the hole lay","there was barely room for my body—yet I was desperate, and\n      determined to persevere. I called Pompey to my side.\n\n      “You perceive that aperture, Pompey. I wish to look through it.\n      You will stand here just beneath the hole—so. Now, hold out one\n      of your hands, Pompey, and let me step upon it—thus. Now, the\n      other hand, Pompey, and with its aid I will get upon your\n      shoulders.”\n\n      He did every thing I wished, and I found, upon getting up, that I\n      could easily pass my head and neck through the aperture. The\r\nprospect was sublime. Nothing could be more magnificent. I merely\n      paused a moment to bid Diana behave herself, and assure Pompey\n      that I would be considerate and bear as lightly as possible upon\n      his shoulders. I told him I would be tender of his feelings—ossi\n      tender que beefsteak. Having done this justice to my faithful\n      friend, I gave myself up with great zest and enthusiasm to the\n      enjoyment of the scene which so obligingly spread itself out\n      before my eyes.\n\n      Upon this subject, however, I shall forbear to dilate. I will not\r\ndescribe the city of Edinburgh. Every one has been to the city of\n      Edinburgh. Every one has been to Edinburgh—the classic Edina. I\n      will confine myself to the momentous details of my own lamentable\n      adventure. Having, in some measure, satisfied my curiosity in\n      regard to the extent, situation, and general appearance of the\n      city, I had leisure to survey the church in which I was, and the\n      delicate architecture of the steeple. I observed that the\n      aperture through which I had thrust my head was an opening in the\r\ndial-plate of a gigantic clock, and must have appeared, from the\n      street, as a large key-hole, such as we see in the face of the\n      French watches. No doubt the true object was to admit the arm of\n      an attendant, to adjust, when necessary, the hands of the clock\n      from within. I observed also, with surprise, the immense size of\n      these hands, the longest of which could not have been less than\n      ten feet in length, and, where broadest, eight or nine inches in\n      breadth. They were of solid steel apparently, and their edges","appeared to be sharp. Having noticed these particulars, and some\n      others, I again turned my eyes upon the glorious prospect below,\n      and soon became absorbed in contemplation.\n\n      From this, after some minutes, I was aroused by the voice of\n      Pompey, who declared that he could stand it no longer, and\n      requested that I would be so kind as to come down. This was\n      unreasonable, and I told him so in a speech of some length. He\n      replied, but with an evident misunderstanding of my ideas upon\n      the subject. I accordingly grew angry, and told him in plain\r\nwords, that he was a fool, that he had committed an ignoramus\n      e-clench-eye, that his notions were mere insommary Bovis, and his\n      words little better than an ennemywerrybor’em. With this he\n      appeared satisfied, and I resumed my contemplations.\n\n      It might have been half an hour after this altercation when, as I\n      was deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery beneath me, I was\n      startled by something very cold which pressed with a gentle\n      pressure on the back of my neck. It is needless to say that I\r\nfelt inexpressibly alarmed. I knew that Pompey was beneath my\n      feet, and that Diana was sitting, according to my explicit\n      directions, upon her hind legs, in the farthest corner of the\n      room. What could it be? Alas! I but too soon discovered. Turning\n      my head gently to one side, I perceived, to my extreme horror,\n      that the huge, glittering, scimetar-like minute-hand of the clock\n      had, in the course of its hourly revolution, descended upon my\n      neck. There was, I knew, not a second to be lost. I pulled back\r\nat once—but it was too late. There was no chance of forcing my\n      head through the mouth of that terrible trap in which it was so\n      fairly caught, and which grew narrower and narrower with a\n      rapidity too horrible to be conceived. The agony of that moment\n      is not to be imagined. I threw up my hands and endeavored, with\n      all my strength, to force upward the ponderous iron bar. I might\n      as well have tried to lift the cathedral itself. Down, down, down\n      it came, closer and yet closer. I screamed to Pompey for aid; but","he said that I had hurt his feelings by calling him “an ignorant\n      old squint-eye.” I yelled to Diana; but she only said\n      “bow-wow-wow,” and that I had told her “on no account to stir\n      from the corner.” Thus I had no relief to expect from my\n      associates.\n\n      Meantime the ponderous and terrific Scythe of Time (for I now\n      discovered the literal import of that classical phrase) had not\n      stopped, nor was it likely to stop, in its career. Down and still\n      down, it came. It had already buried its sharp edge a full inch\r\nin my flesh, and my sensations grew indistinct and confused. At\n      one time I fancied myself in Philadelphia with the stately Dr.\n      Moneypenny, at another in the back parlor of Mr. Blackwood\n      receiving his invaluable instructions. And then again the sweet\n      recollection of better and earlier times came over me, and I\n      thought of that happy period when the world was not all a desert,\n      and Pompey not altogether cruel.\n\n      The ticking of the machinery amused me. Amused me, I say, for my\r\nsensations now bordered upon perfect happiness, and the most\n      trifling circumstances afforded me pleasure. The eternal\n      click-clak, click-clak, click-clak of the clock was the most\n      melodious of music in my ears, and occasionally even put me in\n      mind of the graceful sermonic harangues of Dr. Ollapod. Then\n      there were the great figures upon the dial-plate—how intelligent\n      how intellectual, they all looked! And presently they took to\n      dancing the Mazurka, and I think it was the figure V. who\r\nperformed the most to my satisfaction. She was evidently a lady\n      of breeding. None of your swaggerers, and nothing at all\n      indelicate in her motions. She did the pirouette to\n      admiration—whirling round upon her apex. I made an endeavor to\n      hand her a chair, for I saw that she appeared fatigued with her\n      exertions—and it was not until then that I fully perceived my\n      lamentable situation. Lamentable indeed! The bar had buried\n      itself two inches in my neck. I was aroused to a sense of\n      exquisite pain. I prayed for death, and, in the agony of the","moment, could not help repeating those exquisite verses of the\n      poet Miguel De Cervantes:\n\n     Vanny Buren, tan escondida\n     Query no te senty venny\n     Pork and pleasure, delly morry\n     Nommy, torny, darry, widdy!\n\n      But now a new horror presented itself, and one indeed sufficient\n      to startle the strongest nerves. My eyes, from the cruel pressure\n      of the machine, were absolutely starting from their sockets.\n      While I was thinking how I should possibly manage without them,\n      one actually tumbled out of my head, and, rolling down the steep\r\nside of the steeple, lodged in the rain gutter which ran along\n      the eaves of the main building. The loss of the eye was not so\n      much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which\n      it regarded me after it was out. There it lay in the gutter just\n      under my nose, and the airs it gave itself would have been\n      ridiculous had they not been disgusting. Such a winking and\n      blinking were never before seen. This behavior on the part of my\n      eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its\r\nmanifest insolence and shameful ingratitude, but was also\n      exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which always\n      exists between two eyes of the same head, however far apart. I\n      was forced, in a manner, to wink and to blink, whether I would or\n      not, in exact concert with the scoundrelly thing that lay just\n      under my nose. I was presently relieved, however, by the dropping\n      out of the other eye. In falling it took the same direction\n      (possibly a concerted plot) as its fellow. Both rolled out of the\r\ngutter together, and in truth I was very glad to get rid of them.\n\n      The bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck, and there\n      was only a little bit of skin to cut through. My sensations were\n      those of entire happiness, for I felt that in a few minutes, at\n      farthest, I should be relieved from my disagreeable situation.\n      And in this expectation I was not at all deceived. At twenty-five\n      minutes past five in the afternoon, precisely, the huge\n      minute-hand had proceeded sufficiently far on its terrible","revolution to sever the small remainder of my neck. I was not\n      sorry to see the head which had occasioned me so much\n      embarrassment at length make a final separation from my body. It\n      first rolled down the side of the steeple, then lodge, for a few\n      seconds, in the gutter, and then made its way, with a plunge,\n      into the middle of the street.\n\n      I will candidly confess that my feelings were now of the most\n      singular—nay, of the most mysterious, the most perplexing and\n      incomprehensible character. My senses were here and there at one\r\nand the same moment. With my head I imagined, at one time, that\n      I, the head, was the real Signora Psyche Zenobia—at another I\n      felt convinced that myself, the body, was the proper identity. To\n      clear my ideas on this topic I felt in my pocket for my\n      snuff-box, but, upon getting it, and endeavoring to apply a pinch\n      of its grateful contents in the ordinary manner, I became\n      immediately aware of my peculiar deficiency, and threw the box at\n      once down to my head. It took a pinch with great satisfaction,\r\nand smiled me an acknowledgement in return. Shortly afterward it\n      made me a speech, which I could hear but indistinctly without\n      ears. I gathered enough, however, to know that it was astonished\n      at my wishing to remain alive under such circumstances. In the\n      concluding sentences it quoted the noble words of Ariosto—\n\n     Il pover hommy che non sera corty\n      And have a combat tenty erry morty;\n\n      thus comparing me to the hero who, in the heat of the combat, not\n      perceiving that he was dead, continued to contest the battle with\r\ninextinguishable valor. There was nothing now to prevent my\n      getting down from my elevation, and I did so. What it was that\n      Pompey saw so very peculiar in my appearance I have never yet\n      been able to find out. The fellow opened his mouth from ear to\n      ear, and shut his two eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack\n      nuts between the lids. Finally, throwing off his overcoat, he\n      made one spring for the staircase and disappeared. I hurled after\n      the scoundrel these vehement words of Demosthenes—","Andrew O’Phlegethon, you really make haste to fly,\n\n      and then turned to the darling of my heart, to the one-eyed! the\n      shaggy-haired Diana. Alas! what a horrible vision affronted my\n      eyes? Was that a rat I saw skulking into his hole? Are these the\n      picked bones of the little angel who has been cruelly devoured by\n      the monster? Ye gods! and what do I behold—is that the departed\n      spirit, the shade, the ghost, of my beloved puppy, which I\n      perceive sitting with a grace so melancholy, in the corner?\r\nHearken! for she speaks, and, heavens! it is in the German of\n      Schiller—\n\n      “Unt stubby duk, so stubby dun\n       Duk she! duk she!”\n\n      Alas! and are not her words too true?\n\n      “And if I died, at least I died\n       For thee—for thee.”\n\n      Sweet creature! she too has sacrificed herself in my behalf.\n      Dogless, niggerless, headless, what now remains for the unhappy\n      Signora Psyche Zenobia? Alas—nothing! I have done.\n\n\n\n\nMYSTIFICATION\n\n\n     Slid, if these be your “passados” and “montantes,” I’ll have none\n     o’ them.\n                    —NED KNOWLES.\r\nThe Baron Ritzner von Jung was a noble Hungarian family, every\n      member of which (at least as far back into antiquity as any\n      certain records extend) was more or less remarkable for talent of\n      some description—the majority for that species of _grotesquerie_\n      in conception of which Tieck, a scion of the house, has given a\n      vivid, although by no means the most vivid exemplifications. My\n      acquaintance with Ritzner commenced at the magnificent Chateau\n      Jung, into which a train of droll adventures, not to be made\r\npublic, threw me during the summer months of the year 18—. Here\n      it was that I obtained a place in his regard, and here, with\n      somewhat more difficulty, a partial insight into his mental\n      conformation. In later days this insight grew more clear, as the\n      intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close; and\n      when, after three years separation, we met at G——n, I knew all\n      that it was necessary to know of the character of the Baron\n      Ritzner von Jung.\n\n      I remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within","the college precincts on the night of the twenty-fifth of June. I\n      remember still more distinctly, that while he was pronounced by\n      all parties at first sight “the most remarkable man in the\n      world,” no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion.\n      That he was unique appeared so undeniable, that it was deemed\n      impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted. But,\n      letting this matter pass for the present, I will merely observe\n      that, from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits\r\nof the university, he began to exercise over the habits, manners,\n      persons, purses, and propensities of the whole community which\n      surrounded him, an influence the most extensive and despotic, yet\n      at the same time the most indefinite and altogether\n      unaccountable. Thus the brief period of his residence at the\n      university forms an era in its annals, and is characterized by\n      all classes of people appertaining to it or its dependencies as\n      “that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the\n      Baron Ritzner von Jung.”\r\nUpon his advent to G——n, he sought me out in my apartments. He\n      was then of no particular age, by which I mean that it was\n      impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data\n      personally afforded. He might have been fifteen or fifty, and was\n      twenty-one years and seven months. He was by no means a handsome\n      man—perhaps the reverse. The contour of his face was somewhat\n      angular and harsh. His forehead was lofty and very fair; his nose\n      a snub; his eyes large, heavy, glassy, and meaningless. About the\r\nmouth there was more to be observed. The lips were gently\n      protruded, and rested the one upon the other, after such a\n      fashion that it is impossible to conceive any, even the most\n      complex, combination of human features, conveying so entirely,\n      and so singly, the idea of unmitigated gravity, solemnity and\n      repose.\n\n      It will be perceived, no doubt, from what I have already said,\n      that the Baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to\n      be found, who make the science of mystification the study and the","business of their lives. For this science a peculiar turn of mind\n      gave him instinctively the cue, while his physical appearance\n      afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into\n      effect. I firmly believe that no student at G——n, during that\n      renowned epoch so quaintly termed the domination of the Baron\n      Ritzner von Jung, ever rightly entered into the mystery which\n      overshadowed his character. I truly think that no person at the\n      university, with the exception of myself, ever suspected him to\r\nbe capable of a joke, verbal or practical:—the old bull-dog at\n      the garden-gate would sooner have been accused,—the ghost of\n      Heraclitus,—or the wig of the Emeritus Professor of Theology.\n      This, too, when it was evident that the most egregious and\n      unpardonable of all conceivable tricks, whimsicalities and\n      buffooneries were brought about, if not directly by him, at least\n      plainly through his intermediate agency or connivance. The\n      beauty, if I may so call it, of his art mystifique, lay in that\r\nconsummate ability (resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge\n      of human nature, and a most wonderful self-possession,) by means\n      of which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries he\n      was occupied in bringing to a point, arose partly in spite, and\n      partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for\n      their prevention, and for the preservation of the good order and\n      dignity of Alma Mater. The deep, the poignant, the overwhelming\n      mortification, which upon each such failure of his praise worthy\r\nendeavors, would suffuse every lineament of his countenance, left\n      not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms\n      of even his most skeptical companions. The adroitness, too, was\n      no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the\n      sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created—from his\n      own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise. In no\n      instance before that of which I speak, have I known the habitual\n      mystific escape the natural consequence of his manoevres—an","attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person.\n      Continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim, my friend\n      appeared to live only for the severities of society; and not even\n      his own household have for a moment associated other ideas than\n      those of the rigid and august with the memory of the Baron\n      Ritzner von Jung.\n\n      During the epoch of his residence at G——n it really appeared that\n      the demon of the _dolce far niente_ lay like an incubus upon the\n      university. Nothing, at least, was done beyond eating and\r\ndrinking and making merry. The apartments of the students were\n      converted into so many pot-houses, and there was no pot-house of\n      them all more famous or more frequented than that of the Baron.\n      Our carousals here were many, and boisterous, and long, and never\n      unfruitful of events.\n\n      Upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly\n      daybreak, and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk. The\n      company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the Baron\r\nand myself. Most of these were young men of wealth, of high\n      connection, of great family pride, and all alive with an\n      exaggerated sense of honor. They abounded in the most ultra\n      German opinions respecting the duello. To these Quixotic notions\n      some recent Parisian publications, backed by three or four\n      desperate and fatal rencounters at G——n, had given new vigor and\n      impulse; and thus the conversation, during the greater part of\n      the night, had run wild upon the all-engrossing topic of the\n      times. The Baron, who had been unusually silent and abstracted in\r\nthe earlier portion of the evening, at length seemed to be\n      aroused from his apathy, took a leading part in the discourse,\n      and dwelt upon the benefits, and more especially upon the\n      beauties, of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms\n      with an ardor, an eloquence, an impressiveness, and an\n      affectionateness of manner, which elicited the warmest enthusiasm\n      from his hearers in general, and absolutely staggered even\n      myself, who well knew him to be at heart a ridiculer of those","very points for which he contended, and especially to hold the\n      entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign\n      contempt which it deserves.\n\n      Looking around me during a pause in the Baron’s discourse (of\n      which my readers may gather some faint idea when I say that it\n      bore resemblance to the fervid, chanting, monotonous, yet musical\n      sermonic manner of Coleridge), I perceived symptoms of even more\n      than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party.\n      This gentleman, whom I shall call Hermann, was an original in\r\nevery respect—except, perhaps, in the single particular that he\n      was a very great fool. He contrived to bear, however, among a\n      particular set at the university, a reputation for deep\n      metaphysical thinking, and, I believe, for some logical talent.\n      As a duellist he had acquired great renown, even at G——n. I\n      forget the precise number of victims who had fallen at his hands;\n      but they were many. He was a man of courage undoubtedly. But it\n      was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the\r\nduello, and the nicety of his sense of honor, that he most\n      especially prided himself. These things were a hobby which he\n      rode to the death. To Ritzner, ever upon the lookout for the\n      grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded\n      food for mystification. Of this, however, I was not aware;\n      although, in the present instance, I saw clearly that something\n      of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend, and that\n      Hermann was its especial object.\n\n      As the former proceeded in his discourse, or rather monologue, I\r\nperceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing. At\n      length he spoke; offering some objection to a point insisted upon\n      by R., and giving his reasons in detail. To these the Baron\n      replied at length (still maintaining his exaggerated tone of\n      sentiment) and concluding, in what I thought very bad taste, with\n      a sarcasm and a sneer. The hobby of Hermann now took the bit in\n      his teeth. This I could discern by the studied hair-splitting\n      farrago of his rejoinder. His last words I distinctly remember.","“Your opinions, allow me to say, Baron von Jung, although in the\n      main correct, are, in many nice points, discreditable to yourself\n      and to the university of which you are a member. In a few\n      respects they are even unworthy of serious refutation. I would\n      say more than this, sir, were it not for the fear of giving you\n      offence (here the speaker smiled blandly), I would say, sir, that\n      your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a\n      gentleman.”\n\n      As Hermann completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were\r\nturned upon the Baron. He became pale, then excessively red;\n      then, dropping his pocket-handkerchief, stooped to recover it,\n      when I caught a glimpse of his countenance, while it could be\n      seen by no one else at the table. It was radiant with the\n      quizzical expression which was its natural character, but which I\n      had never seen it assume except when we were alone together, and\n      when he unbent himself freely. In an instant afterward he stood\n      erect, confronting Hermann; and so total an alteration of\r\ncountenance in so short a period I certainly never saw before.\n      For a moment I even fancied that I had misconceived him, and that\n      he was in sober earnest. He appeared to be stifling with passion,\n      and his face was cadaverously white. For a short time he remained\n      silent, apparently striving to master his emotion. Having at\n      length seemingly succeeded, he reached a decanter which stood\n      near him, saying as he held it firmly clenched—“The language you\n      have thought proper to employ, Mynheer Hermann, in addressing\r\nyourself to me, is objectionable in so many particulars, that I\n      have neither temper nor time for specification. That my opinions,\n      however, are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman, is\n      an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line\n      of conduct. Some courtesy, nevertheless, is due to the presence\n      of this company, and to yourself, at this moment, as my guest.\n      You will pardon me, therefore, if, upon this consideration, I\n      deviate slightly from the general usage among gentlemen in","similar cases of personal affront. You will forgive me for the\n      moderate tax I shall make upon your imagination, and endeavor to\n      consider, for an instant, the reflection of your person in yonder\n      mirror as the living Mynheer Hermann himself. This being done,\n      there will be no difficulty whatever. I shall discharge this\n      decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror, and thus fulfil\n      all the spirit, if not the exact letter, of resentment for your\n      insult, while the necessity of physical violence to your real\r\nperson will be obviated.”\n\n      With these words he hurled the decanter, full of wine, against\n      the mirror which hung directly opposite Hermann; striking the\n      reflection of his person with great precision, and of course\n      shattering the glass into fragments. The whole company at once\n      started to their feet, and, with the exception of myself and\n      Ritzner, took their departure. As Hermann went out, the Baron\n      whispered me that I should follow him and make an offer of my\n      services. To this I agreed; not knowing precisely what to make of\r\nso ridiculous a piece of business.\n\n      The duellist accepted my aid with his stiff and _ultra recherché_\n      air, and, taking my arm, led me to his apartment. I could hardly\n      forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss, with\n      the profoundest gravity, what he termed “the refinedly peculiar\n      character” of the insult he had received. After a tiresome\n      harangue in his ordinary style, he took down from his book\n      shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello,\r\nand entertained me for a long time with their contents; reading\n      aloud, and commenting earnestly as he read. I can just remember\n      the titles of some of the works. There were the “Ordonnance of\n      Philip le Bel on Single Combat”; the “Theatre of Honor,” by\n      Favyn, and a treatise “On the Permission of Duels,” by Andiguier.\n      He displayed, also, with much pomposity, Brantome’s “Memoirs of\n      Duels,” published at Cologne, 1666, in the types of Elzevir—a\n      precious and unique vellum-paper volume, with a fine margin, and","bound by Derome. But he requested my attention particularly, and\n      with an air of mysterious sagacity, to a thick octavo, written in\n      barbarous Latin by one Hedelin, a Frenchman, and having the\n      quaint title, “Duelli Lex Scripta, et non; aliterque.” From this\n      he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world concerning\n      “Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se,”\n      about half of which, he averred, was strictly applicable to his\n      own “refinedly peculiar” case, although not one syllable of the\r\nwhole matter could I understand for the life of me. Having\n      finished the chapter, he closed the book, and demanded what I\n      thought necessary to be done. I replied that I had entire\n      confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling, and would abide\n      by what he proposed. With this answer he seemed flattered, and\n      sat down to write a note to the Baron. It ran thus:\n\n      Sir,—My friend, M. P.-, will hand you this note. I find it\n      incumbent upon me to request, at your earliest convenience, an\r\nexplanation of this evening’s occurrences at your chambers. In\n      the event of your declining this request, Mr. P. will be happy to\n      arrange, with any friend whom you may appoint, the steps\n      preliminary to a meeting.\n\n      With sentiments of perfect respect,\n\n      Your most humble servant,\n      JOHANN HERMAN.\n\n      “_To the Baron Ritzner von Jung,\n      August 18th, 18_—.”\n\n      Not knowing what better to do, I called upon Ritzner with this\n      epistle. He bowed as I presented it; then, with a grave\n      countenance, motioned me to a seat. Having perused the cartel, he\r\nwrote the following reply, which I carried to Hermann.\n\n      “SIR,—Through our common friend, Mr. P., I have received your\n      note of this evening. Upon due reflection I frankly admit the\n      propriety of the explanation you suggest. This being admitted, I\n      still find great difficulty, (owing to the refinedly peculiar\n      nature of our disagreement, and of the personal affront offered\n      on my part,) in so wording what I have to say by way of apology,\n      as to meet all the minute exigencies, and all the variable","shadows, of the case. I have great reliance, however, on that\n      extreme delicacy of discrimination, in matters appertaining to\n      the rules of etiquette, for which you have been so long and so\n      pre-eminently distinguished. With perfect certainty, therefore,\n      of being comprehended, I beg leave, in lieu of offering any\n      sentiments of my own, to refer you to the opinions of Sieur\n      Hedelin, as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of\n      “_Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se_,” in\r\nhis “_Duelli Lex scripta, et non; aliterque_.” The nicety of your\n      discernment in all the matters here treated, will be sufficient,\n      I am assured, to convince you _that the mere circumstance of me\n      referring you_ to this admirable passage, ought to satisfy your\n      request, as a man of honor, for explanation.\n\n      “With sentiments of profound respect,\n\n      “Your most obedient servant,\n      “VON JUNG.”\n\n      “The Herr Johann Hermann,\n      August 18th, 18—”\n\n      Hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl,\r\nwhich, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous\n      self-complacency as he came to the rigmarole about Injuriae per\n      applicationem, per constructionem, et per se. Having finished\n      reading, he begged me, with the blandest of all possible smiles,\n      to be seated, while he made reference to the treatise in\n      question. Turning to the passage specified, he read it with great\n      care to himself, then closed the book, and desired me, in my\n      character of confidential acquaintance, to express to the Baron\r\nvon Jung his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior, and, in\n      that of second, to assure him that the explanation offered was of\n      the fullest, the most honorable, and the most unequivocally\n      satisfactory nature.\n\n      Somewhat amazed at all this, I made my retreat to the Baron. He\n      seemed to receive Hermann’s amicable letter as a matter of\n      course, and after a few words of general conversation, went to an\n      inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise “_Duelli Lex\n      scripta, et non; aliterque_.” He handed me the volume and asked","me to look over some portion of it. I did so, but to little\n      purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning.\n      He then took the book himself, and read me a chapter aloud. To my\n      surprise, what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd\n      account of a duel between two baboons. He now explained the\n      mystery; showing that the volume, as it appeared _prima facie_,\n      was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of Du Bartas;\n      that is to say, the language was ingeniously framed so as to\r\npresent to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility, and\n      even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow of meaning\n      existed. The key to the whole was found in leaving out every\n      second and third word alternately, when there appeared a series\n      of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern\n      times.\n\n      The Baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the\n      treatise in Hermann’s way two or three weeks before the\n      adventure, and that he was satisfied, from the general tenor of\r\nhis conversation, that he had studied it with the deepest\n      attention, and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit.\n      Upon this hint he proceeded. Hermann would have died a thousand\n      deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand\n      anything and everything in the universe that had ever been\n      written about the _duello_.\n\n\n\n\nDIDDLING\n\nCONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE EXACT SCIENCES.\n\n\n      Hey, diddle diddle\n      The cat and the fiddle\n\n      Since the world began there have been two Jeremys. The one wrote\r\na Jeremiad about usury, and was called Jeremy Bentham. He has\n      been much admired by Mr. John Neal, and was a great man in a\n      small way. The other gave name to the most important of the Exact\n      Sciences, and was a great man in a great way—I may say, indeed,\n      in the very greatest of ways.\n\n      Diddling—or the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddle—is\n      sufficiently well understood. Yet the fact, the deed, the thing\n      _diddling_, is somewhat difficult to define. We may get, however,\n      at a tolerably distinct conception of the matter in hand, by","defining—not the thing, diddling, in itself—but man, as an animal\n      that diddles. Had Plato but hit upon this, he would have been\n      spared the affront of the picked chicken.\n\n      Very pertinently it was demanded of Plato, why a picked chicken,\n      which was clearly “a biped without feathers,” was not, according\n      to his own definition, a man? But I am not to be bothered by any\n      similar query. Man is an animal that diddles, and there is no\n      animal that diddles but man. It will take an entire hen-coop of\r\npicked chickens to get over that.\n\n      What constitutes the essence, the nare, the principle of diddling\n      is, in fact, peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats\n      and pantaloons. A crow thieves; a fox cheats; a weasel outwits; a\n      man diddles. To diddle is his destiny. “Man was made to mourn,”\n      says the poet. But not so:—he was made to diddle. This is his\n      aim—his object—his end. And for this reason when a man’s diddled\n      we say he’s “_done_.”\n\n      Diddling, rightly considered, is a compound, of which the\r\ningredients are minuteness, interest, perseverance, ingenuity,\n      audacity, _nonchalance_, originality, impertinence, and grin.\n\n      _Minuteness:_—Your diddler is minute. His operations are upon a\n      small scale. His business is retail, for cash, or approved paper\n      at sight. Should he ever be tempted into magnificent speculation,\n      he then, at once, loses his distinctive features, and becomes\n      what we term “financier.” This latter word conveys the diddling\n      idea in every respect except that of magnitude. A diddler may\r\nthus be regarded as a banker _in petto_—a “financial operation,”\n      as a diddle at Brobdignag. The one is to the other, as Homer to\n      “Flaccus”—as a Mastodon to a mouse—as the tail of a comet to that\n      of a pig.\n\n      _Interest:_—Your diddler is guided by self-interest. He scorns to\n      diddle for the mere _sake_ of the diddle. He has an object in\n      view—his pocket—and yours. He regards always the main chance. He\n      looks to Number One. You are Number Two, and must look to\n      yourself.\n\n      _Perseverance:_—Your diddler perseveres. He is not readily","discouraged. Should even the banks break, he cares nothing about\n      it. He steadily pursues his end, and\n\n      ‘Ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto,’\n\n      so he never lets go of his game.\n\n      _Ingenuity:_—Your diddler is ingenious. He has constructiveness\n      large. He understands plot. He invents and circumvents. Were he\n      not Alexander he would be Diogenes. Were he not a diddler, he\n      would be a maker of patent rat-traps or an angler for trout.\n\n      _Audacity:_—Your diddler is audacious.—He is a bold man. He\r\ncarries the war into Africa. He conquers all by assault. He would\n      not fear the daggers of Frey Herren. With a little more prudence\n      Dick Turpin would have made a good diddler; with a trifle less\n      blarney, Daniel O’Connell; with a pound or two more brains,\n      Charles the Twelfth.\n\n      _Nonchalance:_—Your diddler is nonchalant. He is not at all\n      nervous. He never had any nerves. He is never seduced into a\n      flurry. He is never put out—unless put out of doors. He is\n      cool—cool as a cucumber. He is calm—“calm as a smile from Lady\r\nBury.” He is easy—easy as an old glove, or the damsels of ancient\n      Baiæ.\n\n      _Originality:_—Your diddler is original—conscientiously so. His\n      thoughts are his own. He would scorn to employ those of another.\n      A stale trick is his aversion. He would return a purse, I am\n      sure, upon discovering that he had obtained it by an unoriginal\n      diddle.\n\n      _Impertinence:_—Your diddler is impertinent. He swaggers. He sets\n      his arms a-kimbo. He thrusts his hands in his trowsers’ pockets.\n      He sneers in your face. He treads on your corns. He eats your\r\ndinner, he drinks your wine, he borrows your money, he pulls your\n      nose, he kicks your poodle, and he kisses your wife.\n\n      _Grin:_—Your true diddler winds up all with a grin. But this\n      nobody sees but himself. He grins when his daily work is\n      done—when his allotted labors are accomplished—at night in his\n      own closet, and altogether for his own private entertainment. He\n      goes home. He locks his door. He divests himself of his clothes.\n      He puts out his candle. He gets into bed. He places his head upon","the pillow. All this done, and your diddler grins. This is no\n      hypothesis. It is a matter of course. I reason _à priori_, and a\n      diddle would be no diddle without a grin.\n\n      The origin of the diddle is referrable to the infancy of the\n      Human Race. Perhaps the first diddler was Adam. At all events, we\n      can trace the science back to a very remote period of antiquity.\n      The moderns, however, have brought it to a perfection never\n      dreamed of by our thick-headed progenitors. Without pausing to\n      speak of the “old saws,” therefore, I shall content myself with a\r\ncompendious account of some of the more “modern instances.”\n\n      A very good diddle is this. A housekeeper in want of a sofa, for\n      instance, is seen to go in and out of several cabinet warehouses.\n      At length she arrives at one offering an excellent variety. She\n      is accosted, and invited to enter, by a polite and voluble\n      individual at the door. She finds a sofa well adapted to her\n      views, and upon inquiring the price, is surprised and delighted\n      to hear a sum named at least twenty per cent. lower than her\r\nexpectations. She hastens to make the purchase, gets a bill and\n      receipt, leaves her address, with a request that the article be\n      sent home as speedily as possible, and retires amid a profusion\n      of bows from the shopkeeper. The night arrives and no sofa. A\n      servant is sent to make inquiry about the delay. The whole\n      transaction is denied. No sofa has been sold—no money\n      received—except by the diddler, who played shop-keeper for the\n      nonce.\n\n      Our cabinet warehouses are left entirely unattended, and thus\r\nafford every facility for a trick of this kind. Visitors enter,\n      look at furniture, and depart unheeded and unseen. Should any one\n      wish to purchase, or to inquire the price of an article, a bell\n      is at hand, and this is considered amply sufficient.\n\n      Again, quite a respectable diddle is this. A well-dressed\n      individual enters a shop, makes a purchase to the value of a\n      dollar; finds, much to his vexation, that he has left his\n      pocket-book in another coat pocket; and so says to the\n      shopkeeper—","“My dear sir, never mind; just oblige me, will you, by sending\n      the bundle home? But stay! I really believe that I have nothing\n      less than a five dollar bill, even there. However, you can send\n      four dollars in change with the bundle, you know.”\n\n      “Very good, sir,” replies the shop-keeper, who entertains, at\n      once, a lofty opinion of the high-mindedness of his customer. “I\n      know fellows,” he says to himself, “who would just have put the\n      goods under their arm, and walked off with a promise to call and\n      pay the dollar as they came by in the afternoon.”\r\nA boy is sent with the parcel and change. On the route, quite\n      accidentally, he is met by the purchaser, who exclaims:\n\n      “Ah! This is my bundle, I see—I thought you had been home with\n      it, long ago. Well, go on! My wife, Mrs. Trotter, will give you\n      the five dollars—I left instructions with her to that effect. The\n      change you might as well give to me—I shall want some silver for\n      the Post Office. Very good! One, two, is this a good\n      quarter?—three, four—quite right! Say to Mrs. Trotter that you\r\nmet me, and be sure now and do not loiter on the way.”\n\n      The boy doesn’t loiter at all—but he is a very long time in\n      getting back from his errand—for no lady of the precise name of\n      Mrs. Trotter is to be discovered. He consoles himself, however,\n      that he has not been such a fool as to leave the goods without\n      the money, and re-entering his shop with a self-satisfied air,\n      feels sensibly hurt and indignant when his master asks him what\n      has become of the change.\n\n      A very simple diddle, indeed, is this. The captain of a ship,\r\nwhich is about to sail, is presented by an official looking\n      person with an unusually moderate bill of city charges. Glad to\n      get off so easily, and confused by a hundred duties pressing upon\n      him all at once, he discharges the claim forthwith. In about\n      fifteen minutes, another and less reasonable bill is handed him\n      by one who soon makes it evident that the first collector was a\n      diddler, and the original collection a diddle.\n\n      And here, too, is a somewhat similar thing. A steamboat is","casting loose from the wharf. A traveller, portmanteau in hand,\n      is discovered running toward the wharf, at full speed. Suddenly,\n      he makes a dead halt, stoops, and picks up something from the\n      ground in a very agitated manner. It is a pocket-book, and—“Has\n      any gentleman lost a pocketbook?” he cries. No one can say that\n      he has exactly lost a pocket-book; but a great excitement ensues,\n      when the treasure trove is found to be of value. The boat,\n      however, must not be detained.\n\n      “Time and tide wait for no man,” says the captain.\r\n“For God’s sake, stay only a few minutes,” says the finder of the\n      book—“the true claimant will presently appear.”\n\n      “Can’t wait!” replies the man in authority; “cast off there, d’ye\n      hear?”\n\n      “What _am_ I to do?” asks the finder, in great tribulation. “I am\n      about to leave the country for some years, and I cannot\n      conscientiously retain this large amount in my possession. I beg\n      your pardon, sir,” [here he addresses a gentleman on shore,] “but\n      you have the air of an honest man. _Will_ you confer upon me the\r\nfavor of taking charge of this pocket-book—I _know_ I can trust\n      you—and of advertising it? The notes, you see, amount to a very\n      considerable sum. The owner will, no doubt, insist upon rewarding\n      you for your trouble—”\n\n      “_Me!_—no, _you!_—it was you who found the book.”\n\n      “Well, if you _must_ have it so—_I_ will take a small reward—just\n      to satisfy your scruples. Let me see—why these notes are all\n      hundreds—bless my soul! a hundred is too much to take—fifty would\n      be quite enough, I am sure—”\r\n“Cast off there!” says the captain.\n\n      “But then I have no change for a hundred, and upon the whole,\n      _you_ had better—”\n\n      “Cast off there!” says the captain.\n\n      “Never mind!” cries the gentleman on shore, who has been\n      examining his own pocket-book for the last minute or so—“never\n      mind! _I_ can fix it—here is a fifty on the Bank of North\n      America—throw the book.”\n\n      And the over-conscientious finder takes the fifty with marked\n      reluctance, and throws the gentleman the book, as desired, while","the steamboat fumes and fizzes on her way. In about half an hour\n      after her departure, the “large amount” is seen to be a\n      “counterfeit presentment,” and the whole thing a capital diddle.\n\n      A bold diddle is this. A camp-meeting, or something similar, is\n      to be held at a certain spot which is accessible only by means of\n      a free bridge. A diddler stations himself upon this bridge,\n      respectfully informs all passers by of the new county law, which\n      establishes a toll of one cent for foot passengers, two for\r\nhorses and donkeys, and so forth, and so forth. Some grumble but\n      all submit, and the diddler goes home a wealthier man by some\n      fifty or sixty dollars well earned. This taking a toll from a\n      great crowd of people is an excessively troublesome thing.\n\n      A neat diddle is this. A friend holds one of the diddler’s\n      promises to pay, filled up and signed in due form, upon the\n      ordinary blanks printed in red ink. The diddler purchases one or\n      two dozen of these blanks, and every day dips one of them in his\r\nsoup, makes his dog jump for it, and finally gives it to him as a\n      bonne bouche. The note arriving at maturity, the diddler, with\n      the diddler’s dog, calls upon the friend, and the promise to pay\n      is made the topic of discussion. The friend produces it from his\n      escritoire, and is in the act of reaching it to the diddler, when\n      up jumps the diddler’s dog and devours it forthwith. The diddler\n      is not only surprised but vexed and incensed at the absurd\n      behavior of his dog, and expresses his entire readiness to cancel\r\nthe obligation at any moment when the evidence of the obligation\n      shall be forthcoming.\n\n      A very mean diddle is this. A lady is insulted in the street by a\n      diddler’s accomplice. The diddler himself flies to her\n      assistance, and, giving his friend a comfortable thrashing,\n      insists upon attending the lady to her own door. He bows, with\n      his hand upon his heart, and most respectfully bids her adieu.\n      She entreats him, as her deliverer, to walk in and be introduced\n      to her big brother and her papa. With a sigh, he declines to do","so. “Is there no way, then, sir,” she murmurs, “in which I may be\n      permitted to testify my gratitude?”\n\n      “Why, yes, madam, there is. Will you be kind enough to lend me a\n      couple of shillings?”\n\n      In the first excitement of the moment the lady decides upon\n      fainting outright. Upon second thought, however, she opens her\n      purse-strings and delivers the specie. Now this, I say, is a\n      diddle minute—for one entire moiety of the sum borrowed has to be\n      paid to the gentleman who had the trouble of performing the\r\ninsult, and who had then to stand still and be thrashed for\n      performing it.\n\n      Rather a small but still a scientific diddle is this. The diddler\n      approaches the bar of a tavern, and demands a couple of twists of\n      tobacco. These are handed to him, when, having slightly examined\n      them, he says:\n\n      “I don’t much like this tobacco. Here, take it back, and give me\n      a glass of brandy and water in its place.” The brandy and water\n      is furnished and imbibed, and the diddler makes his way to the\r\ndoor. But the voice of the tavern-keeper arrests him.\n\n      “I believe, sir, you have forgotten to pay for your brandy and\n      water.”\n\n      “Pay for my brandy and water!—didn’t I give you the tobacco for\n      the brandy and water? What more would you have?”\n\n      “But, sir, if you please, I don’t remember that you paid me for\n      the tobacco.”\n\n      “What do you mean by that, you scoundrel?—Didn’t I give you back\n      your tobacco? Isn’t that your tobacco lying there? Do you expect\n      me to pay for what I did not take?”\r\n“But, sir,” says the publican, now rather at a loss what to say,\n      “but sir—”\n\n      “But me no buts, sir,” interrupts the diddler, apparently in very\n      high dudgeon, and slamming the door after him, as he makes his\n      escape.—“But me no buts, sir, and none of your tricks upon\n      travellers.”\n\n      Here again is a very clever diddle, of which the simplicity is\n      not its least recommendation. A purse, or pocket-book, being\n      really lost, the loser inserts in one of the daily papers of a\n      large city a fully descriptive advertisement.","Whereupon our diddler copies the facts of this advertisement,\n      with a change of heading, of general phraseology and address. The\n      original, for instance, is long, and verbose, is headed “A\n      Pocket-Book Lost!” and requires the treasure, when found, to be\n      left at No. 1 Tom Street. The copy is brief, and being headed\n      with “Lost” only, indicates No. 2 Dick, or No. 3 Harry Street, as\n      the locality at which the owner may be seen. Moreover, it is\n      inserted in at least five or six of the daily papers of the day,\r\nwhile in point of time, it makes its appearance only a few hours\n      after the original. Should it be read by the loser of the purse,\n      he would hardly suspect it to have any reference to his own\n      misfortune. But, of course, the chances are five or six to one,\n      that the finder will repair to the address given by the diddler,\n      rather than to that pointed out by the rightful proprietor. The\n      former pays the reward, pockets the treasure and decamps.\n\n      Quite an analogous diddle is this. A lady of ton has dropped,\r\nsome where in the street, a diamond ring of very unusual value.\n      For its recovery, she offers some forty or fifty dollars\n      reward—giving, in her advertisement, a very minute description of\n      the gem, and of its settings, and declaring that, on its\n      restoration at No. so and so, in such and such Avenue, the reward\n      would be paid instanter, without a single question being asked.\n      During the lady’s absence from home, a day or two afterwards, a\n      ring is heard at the door of No. so and so, in such and such\n      Avenue; a servant appears; the lady of the house is asked for and\r\nis declared to be out, at which astounding information, the\n      visitor expresses the most poignant regret. His business is of\n      importance and concerns the lady herself. In fact, he had the\n      good fortune to find her diamond ring. But perhaps it would be as\n      well that he should call again. “By no means!” says the servant;\n      and “By no means!” says the lady’s sister and the lady’s\n      sister-in-law, who are summoned forthwith. The ring is\n      clamorously identified, the reward is paid, and the finder nearly","thrust out of doors. The lady returns and expresses some little\n      dissatisfaction with her sister and sister-in-law, because they\n      happen to have paid forty or fifty dollars for a fac-simile of\n      her diamond ring—a fac-simile made out of real pinch-beck and\n      unquestionable paste.\n\n      But as there is really no end to diddling, so there would be none\n      to this essay, were I even to hint at half the variations, or\n      inflections, of which this science is susceptible. I must bring\n      this paper, perforce, to a conclusion, and this I cannot do\r\nbetter than by a summary notice of a very decent, but rather\n      elaborate diddle, of which our own city was made the theatre, not\n      very long ago, and which was subsequently repeated with success,\n      in other still more verdant localities of the Union. A\n      middle-aged gentleman arrives in town from parts unknown. He is\n      remarkably precise, cautious, staid, and deliberate in his\n      demeanor. His dress is scrupulously neat, but plain,\n      unostentatious. He wears a white cravat, an ample waistcoat, made\r\nwith an eye to comfort alone; thick-soled cosy-looking shoes, and\n      pantaloons without straps. He has the whole air, in fact, of your\n      well-to-do, sober-sided, exact, and respectable “man of\n      business,” _par excellence_—one of the stern and outwardly hard,\n      internally soft, sort of people that we see in the crack high\n      comedies—fellows whose words are so many bonds, and who are noted\n      for giving away guineas, in charity, with the one hand, while, in\n      the way of mere bargain, they exact the uttermost fraction of a\r\nfarthing with the other.\n\n      He makes much ado before he can get suited with a boarding house.\n      He dislikes children. He has been accustomed to quiet. His habits\n      are methodical—and then he would prefer getting into a private\n      and respectable small family, piously inclined. Terms, however,\n      are no object—only he must insist upon settling his bill on the\n      first of every month, (it is now the second) and begs his\n      landlady, when he finally obtains one to his mind, not on any","account to forget his instructions upon this point—but to send in\n      a bill, and receipt, precisely at ten o’clock, on the first day\n      of every month, and under no circumstances to put it off to the\n      second.\n\n      These arrangements made, our man of business rents an office in a\n      reputable rather than a fashionable quarter of the town. There is\n      nothing he more despises than pretense. “Where there is much\n      show,” he says, “there is seldom any thing very solid behind”—an\n      observation which so profoundly impresses his landlady’s fancy,\r\nthat she makes a pencil memorandum of it forthwith, in her great\n      family Bible, on the broad margin of the Proverbs of Solomon.\n\n      The next step is to advertise, after some such fashion as this,\n      in the principal business six-pennies of the city—the pennies are\n      eschewed as not “respectable”—and as demanding payment for all\n      advertisements in advance. Our man of business holds it as a\n      point of his faith that work should never be paid for until done.\n\n      “WANTED.—The advertisers, being about to commence extensive\r\nbusiness operations in this city, will require the services of\n      three or four intelligent and competent clerks, to whom a liberal\n      salary will be paid. The very best recommendations, not so much\n      for capacity, as for integrity, will be expected. Indeed, as the\n      duties to be performed involve high responsibilities, and large\n      amounts of money must necessarily pass through the hands of those\n      engaged, it is deemed advisable to demand a deposit of fifty\n      dollars from each clerk employed. No person need apply,\r\ntherefore, who is not prepared to leave this sum in the\n      possession of the advertisers, and who cannot furnish the most\n      satisfactory testimonials of morality. Young gentlemen piously\n      inclined will be preferred. Application should be made between\n      the hours of ten and eleven A. M., and four and five P. M., of\n      Messrs.\n\n      “Bogs, Hogs, Logs, Frogs & Co.,\n      “No. 110 Dog Street.”\n\n      By the thirty-first day of the month, this advertisement has\n      brought to the office of Messrs. Bogs, Hogs, Logs, Frogs, and","Company, some fifteen or twenty young gentlemen piously inclined.\n      But our man of business is in no hurry to conclude a contract\n      with any—no man of business is ever precipitate—and it is not\n      until the most rigid catechism in respect to the piety of each\n      young gentleman’s inclination, that his services are engaged and\n      his fifty dollars receipted for, just by way of proper\n      precaution, on the part of the respectable firm of Bogs, Hogs,\n      Logs, Frogs, and Company. On the morning of the first day of the\r\nnext month, the landlady does not present her bill, according to\n      promise—a piece of neglect for which the comfortable head of the\n      house ending in ogs would no doubt have chided her severely,\n      could he have been prevailed upon to remain in town a day or two\n      for that purpose.\n\n      As it is, the constables have had a sad time of it, running\n      hither and thither, and all they can do is to declare the man of\n      business most emphatically, a “hen knee high”—by which some\n      persons imagine them to imply that, in fact, he is n. e. i.—by\r\nwhich again the very classical phrase _non est inventus_, is\n      supposed to be understood. In the meantime the young gentlemen,\n      one and all, are somewhat less piously inclined than before,\n      while the landlady purchases a shilling’s worth of the Indian\n      rubber, and very carefully obliterates the pencil memorandum that\n      some fool has made in her great family Bible, on the broad margin\n      of the Proverbs of Solomon.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ANGEL OF THE ODD\n\nAN EXTRAVAGANZA.\n\n\n      It was a chilly November afternoon. I had just consummated an\r\nunusually hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic _truffe_ formed\n      not the least important item, and was sitting alone in the\n      dining-room, with my feet upon the fender, and at my elbow a\n      small table which I had rolled up to the fire, and upon which\n      were some apologies for dessert, with some miscellaneous bottles\n      of wine, spirit and _liqueur_. In the morning I had been reading\n      Glover’s “Leonidas,” Wilkie’s “Epigoniad,” Lamartine’s\n      “Pilgrimage,” Barlow’s “Columbiad,” Tuckermann’s “Sicily,” and","Griswold’s “Curiosities”; I am willing to confess, therefore,\n      that I now felt a little stupid. I made effort to arouse myself\n      by aid of frequent Lafitte, and, all failing, I betook myself to\n      a stray newspaper in despair. Having carefully perused the column\n      of “houses to let,” and the column of “dogs lost,” and then the\n      two columns of “wives and apprentices runaway,” I attacked with\n      great resolution the editorial matter, and, reading it from\n      beginning to end without understanding a syllable, conceived the\r\npossibility of its being Chinese, and so re-read it from the end\n      to the beginning, but with no more satisfactory result. I was\n      about throwing away, in disgust,\n\n     “This folio of four pages, happy work\n     Which not even critics criticise,”\n\n      when I felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which\n      follows:\n\n      “The avenues to death are numerous and strange. A London paper\n      mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause. He was\n      playing at ‘puff the dart,’ which is played with a long needle\r\ninserted in some worsted, and blown at a target through a tin\n      tube. He placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube, and\n      drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force,\n      drew the needle into his throat. It entered the lungs, and in a\n      few days killed him.”\n\n      Upon seeing this I fell into a great rage, without exactly\n      knowing why. “This thing,” I exclaimed, “is a contemptible\n      falsehood—a poor hoax—the lees of the invention of some pitiable\n      penny-a-liner—of some wretched concoctor of accidents in\r\nCocaigne. These fellows, knowing the extravagant gullibility of\n      the age, set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable\n      possibilities—-of odd accidents, as they term them; but to a\n      reflecting intellect (like mine,” I added, in parenthesis,\n      putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose,) “to\n      a contemplative understanding such as I myself possess, it seems\n      evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these ‘odd\n      accidents’ is by far the oddest accident of all. For my own part,","I intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the\n      ‘singular’ about it.”\n\n      “Mein Gott, den, vat a vool you bees for dat!” replied one of the\n      most remarkable voices I ever heard. At first I took it for a\n      rumbling in my ears—such as a man sometimes experiences when\n      getting very drunk—but, upon second thought, I considered the\n      sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty\n      barrel beaten with a big stick; and, in fact, this I should have\n      concluded it to be, but for the articulation of the syllables and\r\nwords. I am by no means naturally nervous, and the very few\n      glasses of Lafitte which I had sipped served to embolden me no\n      little, so that I felt nothing of trepidation, but merely\n      uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement, and looked carefully\n      around the room for the intruder. I could not, however, perceive\n      any one at all.\n\n      “Humph!” resumed the voice, as I continued my survey, “you mus pe\n      so dronk as de pig, den, for not zee me as I zit here at your\n      zide.”\r\nHereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose,\n      and there, sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a\n      personage nondescript, although not altogether indescribable. His\n      body was a wine-pipe, or a rum-puncheon, or something of that\n      character, and had a truly Falstaffian air. In its nether\n      extremity were inserted two kegs, which seemed to answer all the\n      purposes of legs. For arms there dangled from the upper portion\n      of the carcass two tolerably long bottles, with the necks outward\r\nfor hands. All the head that I saw the monster possessed of was\n      one of those Hessian canteens which resemble a large snuff-box\n      with a hole in the middle of the lid. This canteen (with a funnel\n      on its top, like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes) was set\n      on edge upon the puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and\n      through this hole, which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a\n      very precise old maid, the creature was emitting certain rumbling\n      and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible","talk.\n\n      “I zay,” said he, “you mos pe dronk as de pig, vor zit dare and\n      not zee me zit ere; and I zay, doo, you mos pe pigger vool as de\n      goose, vor to dispelief vat iz print in de print. ’Tiz de\n      troof—dat it iz—eberry vord ob it.”\n\n      “Who are you, pray?” said I, with much dignity, although somewhat\n      puzzled; “how did you get here? and what is it you are talking\n      about?”\n\n      “Az vor ow I com’d ere,” replied the figure, “dat iz none of your\n      pizzness; and as vor vat I be talking apout, I be talk apout vat\r\nI tink proper; and as vor who I be, vy dat is de very ting I\n      com’d here for to let you zee for yourzelf.”\n\n      “You are a drunken vagabond,” said I, “and I shall ring the bell\n      and order my footman to kick you into the street.”\n\n      “He! he! he!” said the fellow, “hu! hu! hu! dat you can’t do.”\n\n      “Can’t do!” said I, “what do you mean?—I can’t do what?”\n\n      “Ring de pell,” he replied, attempting a grin with his little\n      villanous mouth.\n\n      Upon this I made an effort to get up, in order to put my threat\r\ninto execution; but the ruffian just reached across the table\n      very deliberately, and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the\n      neck of one of the long bottles, knocked me back into the\n      arm-chair from which I had half arisen. I was utterly astounded;\n      and, for a moment, was quite at a loss what to do. In the\n      meantime, he continued his talk.\n\n      “You zee,” said he, “it iz te bess vor zit still; and now you\n      shall know who I pe. Look at me! zee! I am te _Angel ov te Odd_.”\n\n      “And odd enough, too,” I ventured to reply; “but I was always\r\nunder the impression that an angel had wings.”\n\n      “Te wing!” he cried, highly incensed, “vat I pe do mit te wing?\n      Mein Gott! do you take me vor a shicken?”\n\n      “No—oh no!” I replied, much alarmed, “you are no\n      chicken—certainly not.”\n\n      “Well, den, zit still and pehabe yourself, or I’ll rap you again\n      mid me vist. It iz te shicken ab te wing, und te owl ab te wing,\n      und te imp ab te wing, und te head-teuffel ab te wing. Te angel\n      ab _not_ te wing, and I am te _Angel ov te Odd_.”","“And your business with me at present is—is—”\n\n      “My pizzness!” ejaculated the thing, “vy vat a low bred buppy you\n      mos pe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness!”\n\n      This language was rather more than I could bear, even from an\n      angel; so, plucking up courage, I seized a salt-cellar which lay\n      within reach, and hurled it at the head of the intruder. Either\n      he dodged, however, or my aim was inaccurate; for all I\n      accomplished was the demolition of the crystal which protected\r\nthe dial of the clock upon the mantel-piece. As for the Angel, he\n      evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard\n      consecutive raps upon the forehead as before. These reduced me at\n      once to submission, and I am almost ashamed to confess that\n      either through pain or vexation, there came a few tears into my\n      eyes.\n\n      “Mein Gott!” said the Angel of the Odd, apparently much softened\n      at my distress; “mein Gott, te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry\n      zorry. You mos not trink it so strong—you mos put te water in te\r\nwine. Here, trink dis, like a goot veller, und don’t gry\n      now—don’t!”\n\n      Hereupon the Angel of the Odd replenished my goblet (which was\n      about a third full of Port) with a colorless fluid that he poured\n      from one of his hand bottles. I observed that these bottles had\n      labels about their necks, and that these labels were inscribed\n      “Kirschenwasser.”\n\n      The considerate kindness of the Angel mollified me in no little\n      measure; and, aided by the water with which he diluted my Port\n      more than once, I at length regained sufficient temper to listen\r\nto his very extraordinary discourse. I cannot pretend to recount\n      all that he told me, but I gleaned from what he said that he was\n      the genius who presided over the _contretemps_ of mankind, and\n      whose business it was to bring about the _odd accidents_ which\n      are continually astonishing the skeptic. Once or twice, upon my\n      venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his\n      pretensions, he grew very angry indeed, so that at length I\n      considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all, and let him","have his own way. He talked on, therefore, at great length, while\n      I merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut, and amused\n      myself with munching raisins and filliping the stems about the\n      room. But, by and by, the Angel suddenly construed this behavior\n      of mine into contempt. He arose in a terrible passion, slouched\n      his funnel down over his eyes, swore a vast oath, uttered a\n      threat of some character which I did not precisely comprehend,\n      and finally made me a low bow and departed, wishing me, in the\r\nlanguage of the archbishop in Gil-Blas, “_beaucoup de bonheur et\n      un peu plus de bon sens_.”\n\n      His departure afforded me relief. The _very_ few glasses of\n      Lafitte that I had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy,\n      and I felt inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty\n      minutes, as is my custom after dinner. At six I had an\n      appointment of consequence, which it was quite indispensable that\n      I should keep. The policy of insurance for my dwelling house had\n      expired the day before; and, some dispute having arisen, it was\r\nagreed that, at six, I should meet the board of directors of the\n      company and settle the terms of a renewal. Glancing upward at the\n      clock on the mantel-piece, (for I felt too drowsy to take out my\n      watch), I had the pleasure to find that I had still twenty-five\n      minutes to spare. It was half past five; I could easily walk to\n      the insurance office in five minutes; and my usual siestas had\n      never been known to exceed five and twenty. I felt sufficiently\n      safe, therefore, and composed myself to my slumbers forthwith.\r\nHaving completed them to my satisfaction, I again looked toward\n      the time-piece and was half inclined to believe in the\n      possibility of odd accidents when I found that, instead of my\n      ordinary fifteen or twenty minutes, I had been dozing only three;\n      for it still wanted seven and twenty of the appointed hour. I\n      betook myself again to my nap, and at length a second time awoke,\n      when, to my utter amazement, it _still_ wanted twenty-seven\n      minutes of six. I jumped up to examine the clock, and found that","it had ceased running. My watch informed me that it was half past\n      seven; and, of course, having slept two hours, I was too late for\n      my appointment. “It will make no difference,” I said: “I can call\n      at the office in the morning and apologize; in the meantime what\n      can be the matter with the clock?” Upon examining it I discovered\n      that one of the raisin stems which I had been filliping about the\n      room during the discourse of the Angel of the Odd, had flown\n      through the fractured crystal, and lodging, singularly enough, in\r\nthe key-hole, with an end projecting outward, had thus arrested\n      the revolution of the minute hand.\n\n      “Ah!” said I, “I see how it is. This thing speaks for itself. A\n      natural accident, such as _will_ happen now and then!”\n\n      I gave the matter no further consideration, and at my usual hour\n      retired to bed. Here, having placed a candle upon a reading stand\n      at the bed head, and having made an attempt to peruse some pages\n      of the “Omnipresence of the Deity,” I unfortunately fell asleep\r\nin less than twenty seconds, leaving the light burning as it was.\n\n      My dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the Angel of\n      the Odd. Methought he stood at the foot of the couch, drew aside\n      the curtains, and, in the hollow, detestable tones of a rum\n      puncheon, menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the\n      contempt with which I had treated him. He concluded a long\n      harangue by taking off his funnel-cap, inserting the tube into my\n      gullet, and thus deluging me with an ocean of Kirschenwässer,\r\nwhich he poured, in a continuous flood, from one of the long\n      necked bottles that stood him instead of an arm. My agony was at\n      length insufferable, and I awoke just in time to perceive that a\n      rat had ran off with the lighted candle from the stand, but _not_\n      in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the\n      hole. Very soon, a strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils;\n      the house, I clearly perceived, was on fire. In a few minutes the\n      blaze broke forth with violence, and in an incredibly brief","period the entire building was wrapped in flames. All egress from\n      my chamber, except through a window, was cut off. The crowd,\n      however, quickly procured and raised a long ladder. By means of\n      this I was descending rapidly, and in apparent safety, when a\n      huge hog, about whose rotund stomach, and indeed about whose\n      whole air and physiognomy, there was something which reminded me\n      of the Angel of the Odd,—when this hog, I say, which hitherto had\n      been quietly slumbering in the mud, took it suddenly into his\r\nhead that his left shoulder needed scratching, and could find no\n      more convenient rubbing-post than that afforded by the foot of\n      the ladder. In an instant I was precipitated and had the\n      misfortune to fracture my arm.\n\n      This accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more\n      serious loss of my hair, the whole of which had been singed off\n      by the fire, predisposed me to serious impressions, so that,\n      finally, I made up my mind to take a wife. There was a rich widow\n      disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband, and to her\r\nwounded spirit I offered the balm of my vows. She yielded a\n      reluctant consent to my prayers. I knelt at her feet in gratitude\n      and adoration. She blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into\n      close contact with those supplied me, temporarily, by Grandjean.\n      I know not how the entanglement took place, but so it was. I\n      arose with a shining pate, wigless; she in disdain and wrath,\n      half buried in alien hair. Thus ended my hopes of the widow by an\n      accident which could not have been anticipated, to be sure, but\r\nwhich the natural sequence of events had brought about.\n\n      Without despairing, however, I undertook the siege of a less\n      implacable heart. The fates were again propitious for a brief\n      period; but again a trivial incident interfered. Meeting my\n      betrothed in an avenue thronged with the _élite_ of the city, I\n      was hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows,\n      when a small particle of some foreign matter, lodging in the\n      corner of my eye, rendered me, for the moment, completely blind.","Before I could recover my sight, the lady of my love had\n      disappeared—irreparably affronted at what she chose to consider\n      my premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted. While I\n      stood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident, (which might\n      have happened, nevertheless, to any one under the sun), and while\n      I still continued incapable of sight, I was accosted by the Angel\n      of the Odd, who proffered me his aid with a civility which I had\n      no reason to expect. He examined my disordered eye with much\r\ngentleness and skill, informed me that I had a drop in it, and\n      (whatever a “drop” was) took it out, and afforded me relief.\n\n      I now considered it high time to die, (since fortune had so\n      determined to persecute me,) and accordingly made my way to the\n      nearest river. Here, divesting myself of my clothes, (for there\n      is no reason why we cannot die as we were born), I threw myself\n      headlong into the current; the sole witness of my fate being a\n      solitary crow that had been seduced into the eating of\r\nbrandy-saturated corn, and so had staggered away from his\n      fellows. No sooner had I entered the water than this bird took it\n      into its head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of\n      my apparel. Postponing, therefore, for the present, my suicidal\n      design, I just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of\n      my coat, and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the\n      nimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would\n      admit. But my evil destiny attended me still. As I ran at full\r\nspeed, with my nose up in the atmosphere, and intent only upon\n      the purloiner of my property, I suddenly perceived that my feet\n      rested no longer upon _terra-firma_; the fact is, I had thrown\n      myself over a precipice, and should inevitably have been dashed\n      to pieces but for my good fortune in grasping the end of a long\n      guide-rope, which depended from a passing balloon.\n\n      As soon as I sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the\n      terrific predicament in which I stood or rather hung, I exerted","all the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the\n      æronaut overhead. But for a long time I exerted myself in vain.\n      Either the fool could not, or the villain would not perceive me.\n      Meantime the machine rapidly soared, while my strength even more\n      rapidly failed. I was soon upon the point of resigning myself to\n      my fate, and dropping quietly into the sea, when my spirits were\n      suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above, which\n      seemed to be lazily humming an opera air. Looking up, I perceived\r\nthe Angel of the Odd. He was leaning with his arms folded, over\n      the rim of the car; and with a pipe in his mouth, at which he\n      puffed leisurely, seemed to be upon excellent terms with himself\n      and the universe. I was too much exhausted to speak, so I merely\n      regarded him with an imploring air.\n\n      For several minutes, although he looked me full in the face, he\n      said nothing. At length removing carefully his meerschaum from\n      the right to the left corner of his mouth, he condescended to\n      speak.\r\n“Who pe you,” he asked, “und what der teuffel you pe do dare?”\n\n      To this piece of impudence, cruelty and affectation, I could\n      reply only by ejaculating the monosyllable “Help!”\n\n      “Elp!” echoed the ruffian—“not I. Dare iz te pottle—elp yourself,\n      und pe tam’d!”\n\n      With these words he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwasser\n      which, dropping precisely upon the crown of my head, caused me to\n      imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out. Impressed with\n      this idea, I was about to relinquish my hold and give up the\r\nghost with a good grace, when I was arrested by the cry of the\n      Angel, who bade me hold on.\n\n      “Old on!” he said; “don’t pe in te urry—don’t. Will you pe take\n      de odder pottle, or ave you pe got zober yet and come to your\n      zenzes?”\n\n      I made haste, hereupon, to nod my head twice—once in the\n      negative, meaning thereby that I would prefer not taking the\n      other bottle at present—and once in the affirmative, intending\n      thus to imply that I _was_ sober and _had_ positively come to my\n      senses. By these means I somewhat softened the Angel.","“Und you pelief, ten,” he inquired, “at te last? You pelief, ten,\n      in te possibilty of te odd?”\n\n      I again nodded my head in assent.\n\n      “Und you ave pelief in _me_, te Angel of te Odd?”\n\n      I nodded again.\n\n      “Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool?”\n\n      I nodded once more.\n\n      “Put your right hand into your left hand preeches pocket, ten, in\n      token ov your vull zubmizzion unto te Angel ov te Odd.”\n\n      This thing, for very obvious reasons, I found it quite impossible\r\nto do. In the first place, my left arm had been broken in my fall\n      from the ladder, and, therefore, had I let go my hold with the\n      right hand, I must have let go altogether. In the second place, I\n      could have no breeches until I came across the crow. I was\n      therefore obliged, much to my regret, to shake my head in the\n      negative—intending thus to give the Angel to understand that I\n      found it inconvenient, just at that moment, to comply with his\n      very reasonable demand! No sooner, however, had I ceased shaking\n      my head than—\r\n“Go to der teuffel, ten!” roared the Angel of the Odd.\n\n      In pronouncing these words, he drew a sharp knife across the\n      guide-rope by which I was suspended, and as we then happened to\n      be precisely over my own house, (which, during my peregrinations,\n      had been handsomely rebuilt,) it so occurred that I tumbled\n      headlong down the ample chimney and alit upon the dining-room\n      hearth.\n\n      Upon coming to my senses, (for the fall had very thoroughly\n      stunned me,) I found it about four o’clock in the morning. I lay\r\noutstretched where I had fallen from the balloon. My head\n      grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished fire, while my feet\n      reposed upon the wreck of a small table, overthrown, and amid the\n      fragments of a miscellaneous dessert, intermingled with a\n      newspaper, some broken glass and shattered bottles, and an empty\n      jug of the Schiedam Kirschenwasser. Thus revenged himself the\n      Angel of the Odd.\n\n      [Mabbott states that Griswold “obviously had a revised form” for\n      use in the 1856 volume of Poe’s works. Mabbott does not","substantiate this claim, but it is surely not unreasonable. An\n      editor, and even typographical errors, may have produced nearly\n      all of the very minor changes made in this version. (Indeed, two\n      very necessary words were clearly dropped by accident.) An editor\n      might have corrected “Wickliffe’s ‘Epigoniad’” to “Wilkie’s\n      ‘Epigoniad’,” but is unlikely to have added “Tuckerman’s\n      ‘Sicily’” to the list of books read by the narrator. Griswold was\n      not above forgery (in Poe’s letters) when it suited his purpose,\r\nbut would have too little to gain by such an effort in this\n      instance.]\n\n\n\n\nMELLONTA TAUTA\n\nTO THE EDITORS OF THE LADY’S BOOK:\n\n\n      I have the honor of sending you, for your magazine, an article\n      which I hope you will be able to comprehend rather more\n      distinctly than I do myself. It is a translation, by my friend,\n      Martin Van Buren Mavis, (sometimes called the “Poughkeepsie\n      Seer”) of an odd-looking MS. which I found, about a year ago,\n      tightly corked up in a jug floating in the Mare Tenebrarum—a sea\r\nwell described by the Nubian geographer, but seldom visited\n      now-a-days, except for the transcendentalists and divers for\n      crotchets.\n\n      Truly yours,\n\n      EDGAR A. POE\n\n{this paragraph not in the volume—ED}\n\nON BOARD BALLOON “SKYLARK”\n\n      _April_, 1, 2848\n\n      Now, my dear friend—now, for your sins, you are to suffer the\n      infliction of a long gossiping letter. I tell you distinctly that\n      I am going to punish you for all your impertinences by being as\n      tedious, as discursive, as incoherent and as unsatisfactory as\r\npossible. Besides, here I am, cooped up in a dirty balloon, with\n      some one or two hundred of the canaille, all bound on a pleasure\n      excursion, (what a funny idea some people have of pleasure!) and\n      I have no prospect of touching terra firma for a month at least.\n      Nobody to talk to. Nothing to do. When one has nothing to do,\n      then is the time to correspond with ones friends. You perceive,\n      then, why it is that I write you this letter—it is on account of\n      my ennui and your sins.\n\n      Get ready your spectacles and make up your mind to be annoyed. I","mean to write at you every day during this odious voyage.\n\n      Heigho! when will any Invention visit the human pericranium? Are\n      we forever to be doomed to the thousand inconveniences of the\n      balloon? Will nobody contrive a more expeditious mode of\n      progress? The jog-trot movement, to my thinking, is little less\n      than positive torture. Upon my word we have not made more than a\n      hundred miles the hour since leaving home! The very birds beat\n      us—at least some of them. I assure you that I do not exaggerate\r\nat all. Our motion, no doubt, seems slower than it actually\n      is—this on account of our having no objects about us by which to\n      estimate our velocity, and on account of our going with the wind.\n      To be sure, whenever we meet a balloon we have a chance of\n      perceiving our rate, and then, I admit, things do not appear so\n      very bad. Accustomed as I am to this mode of travelling, I cannot\n      get over a kind of giddiness whenever a balloon passes us in a\n      current directly overhead. It always seems to me like an immense\r\nbird of prey about to pounce upon us and carry us off in its\n      claws. One went over us this morning about sunrise, and so nearly\n      overhead that its drag-rope actually brushed the network\n      suspending our car, and caused us very serious apprehension. Our\n      captain said that if the material of the bag had been the\n      trumpery varnished “silk” of five hundred or a thousand years\n      ago, we should inevitably have been damaged. This silk, as he\n      explained it to me, was a fabric composed of the entrails of a\r\nspecies of earth-worm. The worm was carefully fed on mulberries—a\n      kind of fruit resembling a water-melon—and, when sufficiently\n      fat, was crushed in a mill. The paste thus arising was called\n      papyrus in its primary state, and went through a variety of\n      processes until it finally became “silk.” Singular to relate, it\n      was once much admired as an article of female dress! Balloons\n      were also very generally constructed from it. A better kind of\n      material, it appears, was subsequently found in the down\n      surrounding the seed-vessels of a plant vulgarly called","euphorbium, and at that time botanically termed milk-weed. This\n      latter kind of silk was designated as silk-buckingham, on account\n      of its superior durability, and was usually prepared for use by\n      being varnished with a solution of gum caoutchouc—a substance\n      which in some respects must have resembled the gutta percha now\n      in common use. This caoutchouc was occasionally called Indian\n      rubber or rubber of twist, and was no doubt one of the numerous\n      fungi. Never tell me again that I am not at heart an antiquarian.\r\nTalking of drag-ropes—our own, it seems, has this moment knocked\n      a man overboard from one of the small magnetic propellers that\n      swarm in ocean below us—a boat of about six thousand tons, and,\n      from all accounts, shamefully crowded. These diminutive barques\n      should be prohibited from carrying more than a definite number of\n      passengers. The man, of course, was not permitted to get on board\n      again, and was soon out of sight, he and his life-preserver. I\n      rejoice, my dear friend, that we live in an age so enlightened\r\nthat no such a thing as an individual is supposed to exist. It is\n      the mass for which the true Humanity cares. By-the-by, talking of\n      Humanity, do you know that our immortal Wiggins is not so\n      original in his views of the Social Condition and so forth, as\n      his contemporaries are inclined to suppose? Pundit assures me\n      that the same ideas were put nearly in the same way, about a\n      thousand years ago, by an Irish philosopher called Furrier, on\n      account of his keeping a retail shop for cat peltries and other\r\nfurs. Pundit knows, you know; there can be no mistake about it.\n      How very wonderfully do we see verified every day, the profound\n      observation of the Hindoo Aries Tottle (as quoted by\n      Pundit)—“Thus must we say that, not once or twice, or a few\n      times, but with almost infinite repetitions, the same opinions\n      come round in a circle among men.”\n\n      April 2.—Spoke to-day the magnetic cutter in charge of the middle\n      section of floating telegraph wires. I learn that when this\n      species of telegraph was first put into operation by Horse, it","was considered quite impossible to convey the wires over sea, but\n      now we are at a loss to comprehend where the difficulty lay! So\n      wags the world. Tempora mutantur—excuse me for quoting the\n      Etruscan. What would we do without the Atalantic telegraph?\n      (Pundit says Atlantic was the ancient adjective.) We lay to a few\n      minutes to ask the cutter some questions, and learned, among\n      other glorious news, that civil war is raging in Africa, while\n      the plague is doing its good work beautifully both in Yurope and\r\nAyesher. Is it not truly remarkable that, before the magnificent\n      light shed upon philosophy by Humanity, the world was accustomed\n      to regard War and Pestilence as calamities? Do you know that\n      prayers were actually offered up in the ancient temples to the\n      end that these evils (!) might not be visited upon mankind? Is it\n      not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of\n      interest our forefathers acted? Were they so blind as not to\n      perceive that the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only\n      so much positive advantage to the mass!\r\nApril 3.—It is really a very fine amusement to ascend the\n      rope-ladder leading to the summit of the balloon-bag, and thence\n      survey the surrounding world. From the car below you know the\n      prospect is not so comprehensive—you can see little vertically.\n      But seated here (where I write this) in the luxuriously-cushioned\n      open piazza of the summit, one can see everything that is going\n      on in all directions. Just now there is quite a crowd of balloons\n      in sight, and they present a very animated appearance, while the\r\nair is resonant with the hum of so many millions of human voices.\n      I have heard it asserted that when Yellow or (Pundit will have\n      it) Violet, who is supposed to have been the first aeronaut,\n      maintained the practicability of traversing the atmosphere in all\n      directions, by merely ascending or descending until a favorable\n      current was attained, he was scarcely hearkened to at all by his\n      contemporaries, who looked upon him as merely an ingenious sort\n      of madman, because the philosophers (?) of the day declared the","thing impossible. Really now it does seem to me quite\n      unaccountable how any thing so obviously feasible could have\n      escaped the sagacity of the ancient savans. But in all ages the\n      great obstacles to advancement in Art have been opposed by the\n      so-called men of science. To be sure, our men of science are not\n      quite so bigoted as those of old:—oh, I have something so queer\n      to tell you on this topic. Do you know that it is not more than a\n      thousand years ago since the metaphysicians consented to relieve\r\nthe people of the singular fancy that there existed but two\n      possible roads for the attainment of Truth! Believe it if you\n      can! It appears that long, long ago, in the night of Time, there\n      lived a Turkish philosopher (or Hindoo possibly) called Aries\n      Tottle. This person introduced, or at all events propagated what\n      was termed the deductive or a priori mode of investigation. He\n      started with what he maintained to be axioms or “self-evident\n      truths,” and thence proceeded “logically” to results. His\r\ngreatest disciples were one Neuclid, and one Cant. Well, Aries\n      Tottle flourished supreme until advent of one Hog, surnamed the\n      “Ettrick Shepherd,” who preached an entirely different system,\n      which he called the a posteriori or inductive. His plan referred\n      altogether to Sensation. He proceeded by observing, analyzing,\n      and classifying facts-instantiae naturae, as they were affectedly\n      called—into general laws. Aries Tottle’s mode, in a word, was\n      based on noumena; Hog’s on phenomena. Well, so great was the\r\nadmiration excited by this latter system that, at its first\n      introduction, Aries Tottle fell into disrepute; but finally he\n      recovered ground and was permitted to divide the realm of Truth\n      with his more modern rival. The savans now maintained the\n      Aristotelian and Baconian roads were the sole possible avenues to\n      knowledge. “Baconian,” you must know, was an adjective invented\n      as equivalent to Hog-ian and more euphonious and dignified.\n\n      Now, my dear friend, I do assure you, most positively, that I","represent this matter fairly, on the soundest authority; and you\n      can easily understand how a notion so absurd on its very face\n      must have operated to retard the progress of all true\n      knowledge—which makes its advances almost invariably by intuitive\n      bounds. The ancient idea confined investigations to crawling; and\n      for hundreds of years so great was the infatuation about Hog\n      especially, that a virtual end was put to all thinking, properly\n      so called. No man dared utter a truth to which he felt himself\r\nindebted to his Soul alone. It mattered not whether the truth was\n      even demonstrably a truth, for the bullet-headed savans of the\n      time regarded only the road by which he had attained it. They\n      would not even look at the end. “Let us see the means,” they\n      cried, “the means!” If, upon investigation of the means, it was\n      found to come under neither the category Aries (that is to say\n      Ram) nor under the category Hog, why then the savans went no\n      farther, but pronounced the “theorist” a fool, and would have\r\nnothing to do with him or his truth.\n\n      Now, it cannot be maintained, even, that by the crawling system\n      the greatest amount of truth would be attained in any long series\n      of ages, for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be\n      compensated for by any superior certainty in the ancient modes of\n      investigation. The error of these Jurmains, these Vrinch, these\n      Inglitch, and these Amriccans (the latter, by the way, were our\n      own immediate progenitors), was an error quite analogous with\r\nthat of the wiseacre who fancies that he must necessarily see an\n      object the better the more closely he holds it to his eyes. These\n      people blinded themselves by details. When they proceeded\n      Hoggishly, their “facts” were by no means always facts—a matter\n      of little consequence had it not been for assuming that they were\n      facts and must be facts because they appeared to be such. When\n      they proceeded on the path of the Ram, their course was scarcely\n      as straight as a ram’s horn, for they never had an axiom which","was an axiom at all. They must have been very blind not to see\n      this, even in their own day; for even in their own day many of\n      the long “established” axioms had been rejected. For example—“Ex\n      nihilo nihil fit”; “a body cannot act where it is not”; “there\n      cannot exist antipodes”; “darkness cannot come out of light”—all\n      these, and a dozen other similar propositions, formerly admitted\n      without hesitation as axioms, were, even at the period of which I\n      speak, seen to be untenable. How absurd in these people, then, to\r\npersist in putting faith in “axioms” as immutable bases of Truth!\n      But even out of the mouths of their soundest reasoners it is easy\n      to demonstrate the futility, the impalpability of their axioms in\n      general. Who was the soundest of their logicians? Let me see! I\n      will go and ask Pundit and be back in a minute.... Ah, here we\n      have it! Here is a book written nearly a thousand years ago and\n      lately translated from the Inglitch—which, by the way, appears to\n      have been the rudiment of the Amriccan. Pundit says it is\r\ndecidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, Logic. The\n      author (who was much thought of in his day) was one Miller, or\n      Mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some\n      importance, that he had a mill-horse called Bentham. But let us\n      glance at the treatise!\n\n      Ah!—“Ability or inability to conceive,” says Mr. Mill, very\n      properly, “is in no case to be received as a criterion of\n      axiomatic truth.” What modern in his senses would ever think of\n      disputing this truism? The only wonder with us must be, how it\r\nhappened that Mr. Mill conceived it necessary even to hint at any\n      thing so obvious. So far good—but let us turn over another paper.\n      What have we here?—“Contradictories cannot both be true—that is,\n      cannot co-exist in nature.” Here Mr. Mill means, for example,\n      that a tree must be either a tree or not a tree—that it cannot be\n      at the same time a tree and not a tree. Very well; but I ask him\n      why. His reply is this—and never pretends to be any thing else\n      than this—“Because it is impossible to conceive that","contradictories can both be true.” But this is no answer at all,\n      by his own showing, for has he not just admitted as a truism that\n      “ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be received as\n      a criterion of axiomatic truth.”\n\n      Now I do not complain of these ancients so much because their\n      logic is, by their own showing, utterly baseless, worthless and\n      fantastic altogether, as because of their pompous and imbecile\n      proscription of all other roads of Truth, of all other means for\n      its attainment than the two preposterous paths—the one of\r\ncreeping and the one of crawling—to which they have dared to\n      confine the Soul that loves nothing so well as to soar.\n\n      By the by, my dear friend, do you not think it would have puzzled\n      these ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their\n      two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all\n      their truths was, in effect, attained? I mean the truth of\n      Gravitation. Newton owed it to Kepler. Kepler admitted that his\n      three laws were guessed at—these three laws of all laws which led\r\nthe great Inglitch mathematician to his principle, the basis of\n      all physical principle—to go behind which we must enter the\n      Kingdom of Metaphysics: Kepler guessed—that is to say imagined.\n      He was essentially a “theorist”—that word now of so much\n      sanctity, formerly an epithet of contempt. Would it not have\n      puzzled these old moles too, to have explained by which of the\n      two “roads” a cryptographist unriddles a cryptograph of more than\n      usual secrecy, or by which of the two roads Champollion directed\r\nmankind to those enduring and almost innumerable truths which\n      resulted from his deciphering the Hieroglyphics.\n\n      One word more on this topic and I will be done boring you. Is it\n      not passing strange that, with their eternal prattling about\n      roads to Truth, these bigoted people missed what we now so\n      clearly perceive to be the great highway—that of Consistency?\n      Does it not seem singular how they should have failed to deduce\n      from the works of God the vital fact that a perfect consistency","must be an absolute truth! How plain has been our progress since\n      the late announcement of this proposition! Investigation has been\n      taken out of the hands of the ground-moles and given, as a task,\n      to the true and only true thinkers, the men of ardent\n      imagination. These latter theorize. Can you not fancy the shout\n      of scorn with which my words would be received by our progenitors\n      were it possible for them to be now looking over my shoulder?\n      These men, I say, theorize; and their theories are simply\r\ncorrected, reduced, systematized—cleared, little by little, of\n      their dross of inconsistency—until, finally, a perfect\n      consistency stands apparent which even the most stolid admit,\n      because it is a consistency, to be an absolute and an\n      unquestionable truth.\n\n      April 4.—The new gas is doing wonders, in conjunction with the\n      new improvement with gutta percha. How very safe, commodious,\n      manageable, and in every respect convenient are our modern\n      balloons! Here is an immense one approaching us at the rate of at\r\nleast a hundred and fifty miles an hour. It seems to be crowded\n      with people—perhaps there are three or four hundred\n      passengers—and yet it soars to an elevation of nearly a mile,\n      looking down upon poor us with sovereign contempt. Still a\n      hundred or even two hundred miles an hour is slow travelling\n      after all. Do you remember our flight on the railroad across the\n      Kanadaw continent?—fully three hundred miles the hour—that was\n      travelling. Nothing to be seen though—nothing to be done but\n      flirt, feast and dance in the magnificent saloons. Do you\r\nremember what an odd sensation was experienced when, by chance,\n      we caught a glimpse of external objects while the cars were in\n      full flight? Every thing seemed unique—in one mass. For my part,\n      I cannot say but that I preferred the travelling by the slow\n      train of a hundred miles the hour. Here we were permitted to have\n      glass windows—even to have them open—and something like a\n      distinct view of the country was attainable.... Pundit says that\n      the route for the great Kanadaw railroad must have been in some","measure marked out about nine hundred years ago! In fact, he goes\n      so far as to assert that actual traces of a road are still\n      discernible—traces referable to a period quite as remote as that\n      mentioned. The track, it appears was double only; ours, you know,\n      has twelve paths; and three or four new ones are in preparation.\n      The ancient rails were very slight, and placed so close together\n      as to be, according to modern notions, quite frivolous, if not\n      dangerous in the extreme. The present width of track—fifty\r\nfeet—is considered, indeed, scarcely secure enough. For my part,\n      I make no doubt that a track of some sort must have existed in\n      very remote times, as Pundit asserts; for nothing can be clearer,\n      to my mind, than that, at some period—not less than seven\n      centuries ago, certainly—the Northern and Southern Kanadaw\n      continents were united; the Kanawdians, then, would have been\n      driven, by necessity, to a great railroad across the continent.\n\n      April 5.—I am almost devoured by _ennui_. Pundit is the only\n      conversible person on board; and he, poor soul! can speak of\r\nnothing but antiquities. He has been occupied all the day in the\n      attempt to convince me that the ancient Amriccans governed\n      themselves!—did ever anybody hear of such an absurdity?—that they\n      existed in a sort of every-man-for-himself confederacy, after the\n      fashion of the “prairie dogs” that we read of in fable. He says\n      that they started with the queerest idea conceivable, viz: that\n      all men are born free and equal—this in the very teeth of the\n      laws of _gradation_ so visibly impressed upon all things both in\r\nthe moral and physical universe. Every man “voted,” as they\n      called it—that is to say meddled with public affairs—until at\n      length, it was discovered that what is everybody’s business is\n      nobody’s, and that the “Republic” (so the absurd thing was\n      called) was without a government at all. It is related, however,\n      that the first circumstance which disturbed, very particularly,\n      the self-complacency of the philosophers who constructed this\n      “Republic,” was the startling discovery that universal suffrage","gave opportunity for fraudulent schemes, by means of which any\n      desired number of votes might at any time be polled, without the\n      possibility of prevention or even detection, by any party which\n      should be merely villainous enough not to be ashamed of the\n      fraud. A little reflection upon this discovery sufficed to render\n      evident the consequences, which were that rascality must\n      predominate—in a word, that a republican government could never\n      be any thing but a rascally one. While the philosophers, however,\r\nwere busied in blushing at their stupidity in not having foreseen\n      these inevitable evils, and intent upon the invention of new\n      theories, the matter was put to an abrupt issue by a fellow of\n      the name of Mob, who took every thing into his own hands and set\n      up a despotism, in comparison with which those of the fabulous\n      Zeros and Hellofagabaluses were respectable and delectable. This\n      Mob (a foreigner, by-the-by), is said to have been the most\n      odious of all men that ever encumbered the earth. He was a giant\r\nin stature—insolent, rapacious, filthy, had the gall of a bullock\n      with the heart of a hyena and the brains of a peacock. He died,\n      at length, by dint of his own energies, which exhausted him.\n      Nevertheless, he had his uses, as every thing has, however vile,\n      and taught mankind a lesson which to this day it is in no danger\n      of forgetting—never to run directly contrary to the natural\n      analogies. As for Republicanism, no analogy could be found for it\n      upon the face of the earth—unless we except the case of the\r\n“prairie dogs,” an exception which seems to demonstrate, if\n      anything, that democracy is a very admirable form of\n      government—for dogs.\n\n      April 6.—Last night had a fine view of Alpha Lyrae, whose disk,\n      through our captain’s spy-glass, subtends an angle of half a\n      degree, looking very much as our sun does to the naked eye on a\n      misty day. Alpha Lyrae, although so very much larger than our\n      sun, by the by, resembles him closely as regards its spots, its\n      atmosphere, and in many other particulars. It is only within the","last century, Pundit tells me, that the binary relation existing\n      between these two orbs began even to be suspected. The evident\n      motion of our system in the heavens was (strange to say!)\n      referred to an orbit about a prodigious star in the centre of the\n      galaxy. About this star, or at all events about a centre of\n      gravity common to all the globes of the Milky Way and supposed to\n      be near Alcyone in the Pleiades, every one of these globes was\n      declared to be revolving, our own performing the circuit in a\r\nperiod of 117,000,000 of years! We, with our present lights, our\n      vast telescopic improvements, and so forth, of course find it\n      difficult to comprehend the ground of an idea such as this. Its\n      first propagator was one Mudler. He was led, we must presume, to\n      this wild hypothesis by mere analogy in the first instance; but,\n      this being the case, he should have at least adhered to analogy\n      in its development. A great central orb was, in fact, suggested;\n      so far Mudler was consistent. This central orb, however,\r\ndynamically, should have been greater than all its surrounding\n      orbs taken together. The question might then have been asked—“Why\n      do we not see it?”—we, especially, who occupy the mid region of\n      the cluster—the very locality near which, at least, must be\n      situated this inconceivable central sun. The astronomer, perhaps,\n      at this point, took refuge in the suggestion of non-luminosity;\n      and here analogy was suddenly let fall. But even admitting the\n      central orb non-luminous, how did he manage to explain its\r\nfailure to be rendered visible by the incalculable host of\n      glorious suns glaring in all directions about it? No doubt what\n      he finally maintained was merely a centre of gravity common to\n      all the revolving orbs—but here again analogy must have been let\n      fall. Our system revolves, it is true, about a common centre of\n      gravity, but it does this in connection with and in consequence\n      of a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the rest\n      of the system. The mathematical circle is a curve composed of an","infinity of straight lines; but this idea of the circle—this idea\n      of it which, in regard to all earthly geometry, we consider as\n      merely the mathematical, in contradistinction from the practical,\n      idea—is, in sober fact, the practical conception which alone we\n      have any right to entertain in respect to those Titanic circles\n      with which we have to deal, at least in fancy, when we suppose\n      our system, with its fellows, revolving about a point in the\n      centre of the galaxy. Let the most vigorous of human imaginations\r\nbut attempt to take a single step toward the comprehension of a\n      circuit so unutterable! It would scarcely be paradoxical to say\n      that a flash of lightning itself, travelling forever upon the\n      circumference of this inconceivable circle, would still forever\n      be travelling in a straight line. That the path of our sun along\n      such a circumference—that the direction of our system in such an\n      orbit—would, to any human perception, deviate in the slightest\n      degree from a straight line even in a million of years, is a\r\nproposition not to be entertained; and yet these ancient\n      astronomers were absolutely cajoled, it appears, into believing\n      that a decisive curvature had become apparent during the brief\n      period of their astronomical history—during the mere point—during\n      the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years! How\n      incomprehensible, that considerations such as this did not at\n      once indicate to them the true state of affairs—that of the\n      binary revolution of our sun and Alpha Lyrae around a common\n      centre of gravity!\r\nApril 7.—Continued last night our astronomical amusements. Had a\n      fine view of the five Neptunian asteroids, and watched with much\n      interest the putting up of a huge impost on a couple of lintels\n      in the new temple at Daphnis in the moon. It was amusing to think\n      that creatures so diminutive as the lunarians, and bearing so\n      little resemblance to humanity, yet evinced a mechanical\n      ingenuity so much superior to our own. One finds it difficult,\n      too, to conceive the vast masses which these people handle so","easily, to be as light as our own reason tells us they actually\n      are.\n\n      April 8.—Eureka! Pundit is in his glory. A balloon from Kanadaw\n      spoke us to-day and threw on board several late papers; they\n      contain some exceedingly curious information relative to\n      Kanawdian or rather Amriccan antiquities. You know, I presume,\n      that laborers have for some months been employed in preparing the\n      ground for a new fountain at Paradise, the Emperor’s principal\n      pleasure garden. Paradise, it appears, has been, literally\r\nspeaking, an island time out of mind—that is to say, its northern\n      boundary was always (as far back as any record extends) a\n      rivulet, or rather a very narrow arm of the sea. This arm was\n      gradually widened until it attained its present breadth—a mile.\n      The whole length of the island is nine miles; the breadth varies\n      materially. The entire area (so Pundit says) was, about eight\n      hundred years ago, densely packed with houses, some of them\n      twenty stories high; land (for some most unaccountable reason)\r\nbeing considered as especially precious just in this vicinity.\n      The disastrous earthquake, however, of the year 2050, so totally\n      uprooted and overwhelmed the town (for it was almost too large to\n      be called a village) that the most indefatigable of our\n      antiquarians have never yet been able to obtain from the site any\n      sufficient data (in the shape of coins, medals or inscriptions)\n      wherewith to build up even the ghost of a theory concerning the\n      manners, customs, &c., &c., &c., of the aboriginal inhabitants.\r\nNearly all that we have hitherto known of them is, that they were\n      a portion of the Knickerbocker tribe of savages infesting the\n      continent at its first discovery by Recorder Riker, a knight of\n      the Golden Fleece. They were by no means uncivilized, however,\n      but cultivated various arts and even sciences after a fashion of\n      their own. It is related of them that they were acute in many\n      respects, but were oddly afflicted with monomania for building\n      what, in the ancient Amriccan, was denominated “churches”—a kind","of pagoda instituted for the worship of two idols that went by\n      the names of Wealth and Fashion. In the end, it is said, the\n      island became, nine tenths of it, church. The women, too, it\n      appears, were oddly deformed by a natural protuberance of the\n      region just below the small of the back—although, most\n      unaccountably, this deformity was looked upon altogether in the\n      light of a beauty. One or two pictures of these singular women\n      have in fact, been miraculously preserved. They look very odd,\n      very—like something between a turkey-cock and a dromedary.\r\nWell, these few details are nearly all that have descended to us\n      respecting the ancient Knickerbockers. It seems, however, that\n      while digging in the centre of the emperors garden, (which, you\n      know, covers the whole island), some of the workmen unearthed a\n      cubical and evidently chiseled block of granite, weighing several\n      hundred pounds. It was in good preservation, having received,\n      apparently, little injury from the convulsion which entombed it.\n      On one of its surfaces was a marble slab with (only think of it!)\r\nan inscription—a legible inscription. Pundit is in ecstacies.\n      Upon detaching the slab, a cavity appeared, containing a leaden\n      box filled with various coins, a long scroll of names, several\n      documents which appear to resemble newspapers, with other matters\n      of intense interest to the antiquarian! There can be no doubt\n      that all these are genuine Amriccan relics belonging to the tribe\n      called Knickerbocker. The papers thrown on board our balloon are\n      filled with fac-similes of the coins, MSS., typography, &c., &c.\r\nI copy for your amusement the Knickerbocker inscription on the\n      marble slab:—\n\n          This Corner Stone of a Monument to\n                  The Memory of\n                GEORGE WASHINGTON\n          Was Laid With Appropriate Ceremonies\n                    on the\n             19th Day of October, 1847\n          The anniversary of the surrender of\n                 Lord Cornwallis\n          to General Washington at Yorktown\n                 A. D. 1781\n            Under the Auspices of the\n          Washington Monument Association of","the city of New York\n\n      This, as I give it, is a verbatim translation done by Pundit\n      himself, so there can be no mistake about it. From the few words\n      thus preserved, we glean several important items of knowledge,\n      not the least interesting of which is the fact that a thousand\n      years ago actual monuments had fallen into disuse—as was all very\n      proper—the people contenting themselves, as we do now, with a\n      mere indication of the design to erect a monument at some future\n      time; a corner-stone being cautiously laid by itself “solitary\r\nand alone” (excuse me for quoting the great American poet\n      Benton!), as a guarantee of the magnanimous intention. We\n      ascertain, too, very distinctly, from this admirable inscription,\n      the how as well as the where and the what, of the great surrender\n      in question. As to the where, it was Yorktown (wherever that\n      was), and as to the what, it was General Cornwallis (no doubt\n      some wealthy dealer in corn). He was surrendered. The inscription\n      commemorates the surrender of—what?—why, “of Lord Cornwallis.”\r\nThe only question is what could the savages wish him surrendered\n      for. But when we remember that these savages were undoubtedly\n      cannibals, we are led to the conclusion that they intended him\n      for sausage. As to the how of the surrender, no language can be\n      more explicit. Lord Cornwallis was surrendered (for sausage)\n      “under the auspices of the Washington Monument Association”—no\n      doubt a charitable institution for the depositing of\n      corner-stones.—But, Heaven bless me! what is the matter? Ah, I\r\nsee—the balloon has collapsed, and we shall have a tumble into\n      the sea. I have, therefore, only time enough to add that, from a\n      hasty inspection of the fac-similes of newspapers, &c., &c., I\n      find that the great men in those days among the Amriccans, were\n      one John, a smith, and one Zacchary, a tailor.\n\n      Good-bye, until I see you again. Whether you ever get this letter\n      or not is point of little importance, as I write altogether for\n      my own amusement. I shall cork the MS. up in a bottle, however,","and throw it into the sea.\n\n      Yours everlastingly,\n       PUNDITA.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DUC DE L’OMELETTE.\n\n\nAnd stepped at once into a cooler clime.—_Cowper_.\n\n      Keats fell by a criticism. Who was it died of “The Andromache”?\n      {*1} Ignoble souls!—De L’Omelette perished of an ortolan.\n      _L’histoire en est brève_. Assist me, Spirit of Apicius!\n\n      A golden cage bore the little winged wanderer, enamored, melting,\n      indolent, to the _Chaussée D’Antin_, from its home in far Peru.\n      From its queenly possessor La Bellissima, to the Duc De\r\nL’Omelette, six peers of the empire conveyed the happy bird.\n\n      That night the Duc was to sup alone. In the privacy of his bureau\n      he reclined languidly on that ottoman for which he sacrificed his\n      loyalty in outbidding his king—the notorious ottoman of Cadêt.\n\n      He buries his face in the pillow. The clock strikes! Unable to\n      restrain his feelings, his Grace swallows an olive. At this\n      moment the door gently opens to the sound of soft music, and lo!\n      the most delicate of birds is before the most enamored of men!\r\nBut what inexpressible dismay now overshadows the countenance of\n      the Duc?—“_Horreur!—chien! Baptiste!—l’oiseau! ah, bon Dieu! cet\n      oiseau modeste que tu as déshabillé de ses plumes, et que tu as\n      servi sans papier!_” It is superfluous to say more:—the Duc\n      expired in a paroxysm of disgust.\n\n      “Ha! ha! ha!” said his Grace on the third day after his decease.\n\n      “He! he! he!” replied the Devil faintly, drawing himself up with\n      an air of _hauteur_.\n\n      “Why, surely you are not serious,” retorted De L’Omelette. “I\r\nhave sinned—c’est vrai—but, my good sir, consider!—you have no\n      actual intention of putting such—such barbarous threats into\n      execution.”\n\n      “No _what?_” said his majesty—“come, sir, strip!”\n\n      “Strip, indeed! very pretty i’ faith! no, sir, I shall _not_\n      strip. Who are you, pray, that I, Duc De L’Omelette, Prince de\n      Foie-Gras, just come of age, author of the ‘Mazurkiad,’ and\n      Member of the Academy, should divest myself at your bidding of\n      the sweetest pantaloons ever made by Bourdon, the daintiest","_robe-de-chambre_ ever put together by Rombêrt—to say nothing of\n      the taking my hair out of paper—not to mention the trouble I\n      should have in drawing off my gloves?”\n\n      “Who am I?—ah, true! I am Baal-Zebub, Prince of the Fly. I took\n      thee, just now, from a rose-wood coffin inlaid with ivory. Thou\n      wast curiously scented, and labelled as per invoice. Belial sent\n      thee,—my Inspector of Cemeteries. The pantaloons, which thou\n      sayest were made by Bourdon, are an excellent pair of linen\n      drawers, and thy _robe-de-chambre_ is a shroud of no scanty\r\ndimensions.”\n\n      “Sir!” replied the Duc, “I am not to be insulted with\n      impunity!—Sir! I shall take the earliest opportunity of avenging\n      this insult!—Sir! you shall hear from me! in the meantime _au\n      revoir!_”—and the Duc was bowing himself out of the Satanic\n      presence, when he was interrupted and brought back by a gentleman\n      in waiting. Hereupon his Grace rubbed his eyes, yawned, shrugged\n      his shoulders, reflected. Having become satisfied of his\n      identity, he took a bird’s eye view of his whereabouts.\r\nThe apartment was superb. Even De L’Omelette pronounced it _bien\n      comme il faut_. It was not its length nor its breadth,—but its\n      height—ah, that was appalling!—There was no ceiling—certainly\n      none—but a dense whirling mass of fiery-colored clouds. His\n      Grace’s brain reeled as he glanced upward. From above, hung a\n      chain of an unknown blood-red metal—its upper end lost, like the\n      city of Boston, _parmi les nues_. From its nether extremity swung\n      a large cresset. The Duc knew it to be a ruby; but from it there\r\npoured a light so intense, so still, so terrible, Persia never\n      worshipped such—Gheber never imagined such—Mussulman never\n      dreamed of such when, drugged with opium, he has tottered to a\n      bed of poppies, his back to the flowers, and his face to the God\n      Apollo. The Duc muttered a slight oath, decidedly approbatory.\n\n      The corners of the room were rounded into niches. Three of these\n      were filled with statues of gigantic proportions. Their beauty\n      was Grecian, their deformity Egyptian, their _tout ensemble_","French. In the fourth niche the statue was veiled; it was _not_\n      colossal. But then there was a taper ankle, a sandalled foot. De\n      L’Omelette pressed his hand upon his heart, closed his eyes,\n      raised them, and caught his Satanic Majesty—in a blush.\n\n      But the paintings!—Kupris! Astarte! Astoreth!—a thousand and the\n      same! And Rafaelle has beheld them! Yes, Rafaelle has been here,\n      for did he not paint the—? and was he not consequently damned?\n      The paintings—the paintings! O luxury! O love!—who, gazing on\r\nthose forbidden beauties, shall have eyes for the dainty devices\n      of the golden frames that besprinkled, like stars, the hyacinth\n      and the porphyry walls?\n\n      But the Duc’s heart is fainting within him. He is not, however,\n      as you suppose, dizzy with magnificence, nor drunk with the\n      ecstatic breath of those innumerable censers. _C’est vrai que de\n      toutes ces choses il a pensé beaucoup—mais!_ The Duc De\n      L’Omelette is terror-stricken; for, through the lurid vista which\n      a single uncurtained window is affording, lo! gleams the most\r\nghastly of all fires!\n\n      _Le pauvre Duc!_ He could not help imagining that the glorious,\n      the voluptuous, the never-dying melodies which pervaded that\n      hall, as they passed filtered and transmuted through the alchemy\n      of the enchanted window-panes, were the wailings and the howlings\n      of the hopeless and the damned! And there, too!—there!—upon the\n      ottoman!—who could _he_ be?—he, the _petitmaître_—no, the\n      Deity—who sat as if carved in marble, _et qui sourit_, with his\n      pale countenance, _si amèrement?_\r\n_Mais il faut agir_—that is to say, a Frenchman never faints\n      outright. Besides, his Grace hated a scene—De L’Omelette is\n      himself again. There were some foils upon a table—some points\n      also. The Duc had studied under B——; _il avait tué ses six\n      hommes._ Now, then, _il peut s’échapper_. He measures two points,\n      and, with a grace inimitable, offers his Majesty the choice.\n      _Horreur!_ his Majesty does not fence!\n\n      _Mais il joue!_—how happy a thought!—but his Grace had always an","excellent memory. He had dipped in the “_Diable_” of Abbé\n      Gualtier. Therein it is said “_que le Diable n’ose pas refuser un\n      jeu d’écarté._”\n\n      But the chances—the chances! True—desperate: but scarcely more\n      desperate than the Duc. Besides, was he not in the secret?—had he\n      not skimmed over Père Le Brun?—was he not a member of the Club\n      Vingt-un? “_Si je perds_,” said he, “_je serai deux fois perdu_—I\n      shall be doubly damned—_voilà tout!_ (Here his Grace shrugged his\n      shoulders.) _Si je gagne, je reviendrai a mes ortolans—que les\r\ncartes soient préparées!_”\n\n      His Grace was all care, all attention—his Majesty all confidence.\n      A spectator would have thought of Francis and Charles. His Grace\n      thought of his game. His Majesty did not think; he shuffled. The\n      Duc cut.\n\n      The cards were dealt. The trump is turned—it is—it is—the king!\n      No—it was the queen. His Majesty cursed her masculine\n      habiliments. De L’Omelette placed his hand upon his heart.\n\n      They play. The Duc counts. The hand is out. His Majesty counts\r\nheavily, smiles, and is taking wine. The Duc slips a card.\n\n      “_C’est à vous à faire_,” said his Majesty, cutting. His Grace\n      bowed, dealt, and arose from the table _en presentant le Roi_.\n\n      His Majesty looked chagrined.\n\n      Had Alexander not been Alexander, he would have been Diogenes;\n      and the Duc assured his antagonist in taking leave, “_que s’il\n      n’eût été De L’Omelette il n’aurait point d’objection d’être le\n      Diable._”\n\n\n\n\nTHE OBLONG BOX.\n\n\n      Some years ago, I engaged passage from Charleston, S. C., to the\r\ncity of New York, in the fine packet-ship “Independence,” Captain\n      Hardy. We were to sail on the fifteenth of the month (June),\n      weather permitting; and on the fourteenth, I went on board to\n      arrange some matters in my state-room.\n\n      I found that we were to have a great many passengers, including a\n      more than usual number of ladies. On the list were several of my\n      acquaintances, and among other names, I was rejoiced to see that\n      of Mr. Cornelius Wyatt, a young artist, for whom I entertained\n      feelings of warm friendship. He had been with me a fellow-student","at C—— University, where we were very much together. He had the\n      ordinary temperament of genius, and was a compound of\n      misanthropy, sensibility, and enthusiasm. To these qualities he\n      united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human\n      bosom.\n\n      I observed that his name was carded upon three state-rooms; and,\n      upon again referring to the list of passengers, I found that he\n      had engaged passage for himself, wife, and two sisters—his own.\n      The state-rooms were sufficiently roomy, and each had two berths,\r\none above the other. These berths, to be sure, were so\n      exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one\n      person; still, I could not comprehend why there were three\n      state-rooms for these four persons. I was, just at that epoch, in\n      one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally\n      inquisitive about trifles: and I confess, with shame, that I\n      busied myself in a variety of ill-bred and preposterous\n      conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary state-room. It\r\nwas no business of mine, to be sure, but with none the less\n      pertinacity did I occupy myself in attempts to resolve the\n      enigma. At last I reached a conclusion which wrought in me great\n      wonder why I had not arrived at it before. “It is a servant of\n      course,” I said; “what a fool I am, not sooner to have thought of\n      so obvious a solution!” And then I again repaired to the list—but\n      here I saw distinctly that no servant was to come with the party,\n      although, in fact, it had been the original design to bring\r\none—for the words “and servant” had been first written and then\n      overscored. “Oh, extra baggage, to be sure,” I now said to\n      myself—“something he wishes not to be put in the hold—something\n      to be kept under his own eye—ah, I have it—a painting or so—and\n      this is what he has been bargaining about with Nicolino, the\n      Italian Jew.” This idea satisfied me, and I dismissed my\n      curiosity for the nonce.\n\n      Wyatt’s two sisters I knew very well, and most amiable and clever\n      girls they were. His wife he had newly married, and I had never","yet seen her. He had often talked about her in my presence,\n      however, and in his usual style of enthusiasm. He described her\n      as of surpassing beauty, wit, and accomplishment. I was,\n      therefore, quite anxious to make her acquaintance.\n\n      On the day in which I visited the ship (the fourteenth), Wyatt\n      and party were also to visit it—so the captain informed me—and I\n      waited on board an hour longer than I had designed, in hope of\n      being presented to the bride, but then an apology came. “Mrs. W.\r\nwas a little indisposed, and would decline coming on board until\n      to-morrow, at the hour of sailing.”\n\n      The morrow having arrived, I was going from my hotel to the\n      wharf, when Captain Hardy met me and said that, “owing to\n      circumstances” (a stupid but convenient phrase), “he rather\n      thought the ‘Independence’ would not sail for a day or two, and\n      that when all was ready, he would send up and let me know.” This\n      I thought strange, for there was a stiff southerly breeze; but as\n      “the circumstances” were not forthcoming, although I pumped for\r\nthem with much perseverance, I had nothing to do but to return\n      home and digest my impatience at leisure.\n\n      I did not receive the expected message from the captain for\n      nearly a week. It came at length, however, and I immediately went\n      on board. The ship was crowded with passengers, and every thing\n      was in the bustle attendant upon making sail. Wyatt’s party\n      arrived in about ten minutes after myself. There were the two\n      sisters, the bride, and the artist—the latter in one of his\n      customary fits of moody misanthropy. I was too well used to\r\nthese, however, to pay them any special attention. He did not\n      even introduce me to his wife—this courtesy devolving, per force,\n      upon his sister Marian—a very sweet and intelligent girl, who, in\n      a few hurried words, made us acquainted.\n\n      Mrs. Wyatt had been closely veiled; and when she raised her veil,\n      in acknowledging my bow, I confess that I was very profoundly\n      astonished. I should have been much more so, however, had not\n      long experience advised me not to trust, with too implicit a","reliance, the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend, the artist,\n      when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman. When\n      beauty was the theme, I well knew with what facility he soared\n      into the regions of the purely ideal.\n\n      The truth is, I could not help regarding Mrs. Wyatt as a\n      decidedly plain-looking woman. If not positively ugly, she was\n      not, I think, very far from it. She was dressed, however, in\n      exquisite taste—and then I had no doubt that she had captivated\r\nmy friend’s heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect\n      and soul. She said very few words, and passed at once into her\n      state-room with Mr. W.\n\n      My old inquisitiveness now returned. There was no servant—that\n      was a settled point. I looked, therefore, for the extra baggage.\n      After some delay, a cart arrived at the wharf, with an oblong\n      pine box, which was every thing that seemed to be expected.\n      Immediately upon its arrival we made sail, and in a short time\n      were safely over the bar and standing out to sea.\r\nThe box in question was, as I say, oblong. It was about six feet\n      in length by two and a half in breadth; I observed it\n      attentively, and like to be precise. Now this shape was peculiar;\n      and no sooner had I seen it, than I took credit to myself for the\n      accuracy of my guessing. I had reached the conclusion, it will be\n      remembered, that the extra baggage of my friend, the artist,\n      would prove to be pictures, or at least a picture; for I knew he\n      had been for several weeks in conference with Nicolino:—and now\r\nhere was a box, which, from its shape, could possibly contain\n      nothing in the world but a copy of Leonardo’s “Last Supper;” and\n      a copy of this very “Last Supper,” done by Rubini the younger, at\n      Florence, I had known, for some time, to be in the possession of\n      Nicolino. This point, therefore, I considered as sufficiently\n      settled. I chuckled excessively when I thought of my acumen. It\n      was the first time I had ever known Wyatt to keep from me any of\n      his artistical secrets; but here he evidently intended to steal a","march upon me, and smuggle a fine picture to New York, under my\n      very nose; expecting me to know nothing of the matter. I resolved\n      to quiz him well, now and hereafter.\n\n      One thing, however, annoyed me not a little. The box did not go\n      into the extra state-room. It was deposited in Wyatt’s own; and\n      there, too, it remained, occupying very nearly the whole of the\n      floor—no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his\n      wife;—this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it\n      was lettered in sprawling capitals, emitted a strong,\r\ndisagreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly disgusting odor. On\n      the lid were painted the words—“Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, Albany, New\n      York. Charge of Cornelius Wyatt, Esq. This side up. To be handled\n      with care.”\n\n      Now, I was aware that Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, of Albany, was the\n      artist’s wife’s mother,—but then I looked upon the whole address\n      as a mystification, intended especially for myself. I made up my\n      mind, of course, that the box and contents would never get\n      farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend, in\r\nChambers Street, New York.\n\n      For the first three or four days we had fine weather, although\n      the wind was dead ahead; having chopped round to the northward,\n      immediately upon our losing sight of the coast. The passengers\n      were, consequently, in high spirits and disposed to be social. I\n      must except, however, Wyatt and his sisters, who behaved stiffly,\n      and, I could not help thinking, uncourteously to the rest of the\n      party. Wyatt’s conduct I did not so much regard. He was gloomy,\r\neven beyond his usual habit—in fact he was morose—but in him I\n      was prepared for eccentricity. For the sisters, however, I could\n      make no excuse. They secluded themselves in their staterooms\n      during the greater part of the passage, and absolutely refused,\n      although I repeatedly urged them, to hold communication with any\n      person on board.\n\n      Mrs. Wyatt herself was far more agreeable. That is to say, she\n      was chatty; and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea.\n      She became excessively intimate with most of the ladies; and, to","my profound astonishment, evinced no equivocal disposition to\n      coquet with the men. She amused us all very much. I say\n      “amused”—and scarcely know how to explain myself. The truth is, I\n      soon found that Mrs. W. was far oftener laughed at than with. The\n      gentlemen said little about her; but the ladies, in a little\n      while, pronounced her “a good-hearted thing, rather indifferent\n      looking, totally uneducated, and decidedly vulgar.” The great\n      wonder was, how Wyatt had been entrapped into such a match.\r\nWealth was the general solution—but this I knew to be no solution\n      at all; for Wyatt had told me that she neither brought him a\n      dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever. “He had\n      married,” he said, “for love, and for love only; and his bride\n      was far more than worthy of his love.” When I thought of these\n      expressions, on the part of my friend, I confess that I felt\n      indescribably puzzled. Could it be possible that he was taking\n      leave of his senses? What else could I think? He, so refined, so\r\nintellectual, so fastidious, with so exquisite a perception of\n      the faulty, and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful! To be\n      sure, the lady seemed especially fond of him—particularly so in\n      his absence—when she made herself ridiculous by frequent\n      quotations of what had been said by her “beloved husband, Mr.\n      Wyatt.” The word “husband” seemed forever—to use one of her own\n      delicate expressions—forever “on the tip of her tongue.” In the\n      meantime, it was observed by all on board, that he avoided her in\r\nthe most pointed manner, and, for the most part, shut himself up\n      alone in his state-room, where, in fact, he might have been said\n      to live altogether, leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse\n      herself as she thought best, in the public society of the main\n      cabin.\n\n      My conclusion, from what I saw and heard, was, that, the artist,\n      by some unaccountable freak of fate, or perhaps in some fit of\n      enthusiastic and fanciful passion, had been induced to unite\n      himself with a person altogether beneath him, and that the","natural result, entire and speedy disgust, had ensued. I pitied\n      him from the bottom of my heart—but could not, for that reason,\n      quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the “Last\n      Supper.” For this I resolved to have my revenge.\n\n      One day he came upon deck, and, taking his arm as had been my\n      wont, I sauntered with him backward and forward. His gloom,\n      however (which I considered quite natural under the\n      circumstances), seemed entirely unabated. He said little, and\n      that moodily, and with evident effort. I ventured a jest or two,\r\nand he made a sickening attempt at a smile. Poor fellow!—as I\n      thought of his wife, I wondered that he could have heart to put\n      on even the semblance of mirth. I determined to commence a series\n      of covert insinuations, or innuendoes, about the oblong box—just\n      to let him perceive, gradually, that I was not altogether the\n      butt, or victim, of his little bit of pleasant mystification. My\n      first observation was by way of opening a masked battery. I said\n      something about the “peculiar shape of _that_ box”; and, as I\r\nspoke the words, I smiled knowingly, winked, and touched him\n      gently with my forefinger in the ribs.\n\n      The manner in which Wyatt received this harmless pleasantry\n      convinced me, at once, that he was mad. At first he stared at me\n      as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my\n      remark; but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his\n      brain, his eyes, in the same proportion, seemed protruding from\n      their sockets. Then he grew very red—then hideously pale—then, as\n      if highly amused with what I had insinuated, he began a loud and\r\nboisterous laugh, which, to my astonishment, he kept up, with\n      gradually increasing vigor, for ten minutes or more. In\n      conclusion, he fell flat and heavily upon the deck. When I ran to\n      uplift him, to all appearance he was dead.\n\n      I called assistance, and, with much difficulty, we brought him to\n      himself. Upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time. At\n      length we bled him and put him to bed. The next morning he was\n      quite recovered, so far as regarded his mere bodily health. Of","his mind I say nothing, of course. I avoided him during the rest\n      of the passage, by advice of the captain, who seemed to coincide\n      with me altogether in my views of his insanity, but cautioned me\n      to say nothing on this head to any person on board.\n\n      Several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of\n      Wyatt which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which I\n      was already possessed. Among other things, this: I had been\n      nervous—drank too much strong green tea, and slept ill at\r\nnight—in fact, for two nights I could not be properly said to\n      sleep at all. Now, my state-room opened into the main cabin, or\n      dining-room, as did those of all the single men on board. Wyatt’s\n      three rooms were in the after-cabin, which was separated from the\n      main one by a slight sliding door, never locked even at night. As\n      we were almost constantly on a wind, and the breeze was not a\n      little stiff, the ship heeled to leeward very considerably; and\n      whenever her starboard side was to leeward, the sliding door\r\nbetween the cabins slid open, and so remained, nobody taking the\n      trouble to get up and shut it. But my berth was in such a\n      position, that when my own state-room door was open, as well as\n      the sliding door in question (and my own door was always open on\n      account of the heat,) I could see into the after-cabin quite\n      distinctly, and just at that portion of it, too, where were\n      situated the state-rooms of Mr. Wyatt. Well, during two nights\n      (not consecutive) while I lay awake, I clearly saw Mrs. W., about\r\neleven o’clock upon each night, steal cautiously from the\n      state-room of Mr. W., and enter the extra room, where she\n      remained until daybreak, when she was called by her husband and\n      went back. That they were virtually separated was clear. They had\n      separate apartments—no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent\n      divorce; and here, after all I thought was the mystery of the\n      extra state-room.\n\n      There was another circumstance, too, which interested me much.\n      During the two wakeful nights in question, and immediately after","the disappearance of Mrs. Wyatt into the extra state-room, I was\n      attracted by certain singular cautious, subdued noises in that of\n      her husband. After listening to them for some time, with\n      thoughtful attention, I at length succeeded perfectly in\n      translating their import. They were sounds occasioned by the\n      artist in prying open the oblong box, by means of a chisel and\n      mallet—the latter being apparently muffled, or deadened, by some\n      soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped.\r\nIn this manner I fancied I could distinguish the precise moment\n      when he fairly disengaged the lid—also, that I could determine\n      when he removed it altogether, and when he deposited it upon the\n      lower berth in his room; this latter point I knew, for example,\n      by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the\n      wooden edges of the berth, as he endeavored to lay it down very\n      gently—there being no room for it on the floor. After this there\n      was a dead stillness, and I heard nothing more, upon either\r\noccasion, until nearly daybreak; unless, perhaps, I may mention a\n      low sobbing, or murmuring sound, so very much suppressed as to be\n      nearly inaudible—if, indeed, the whole of this latter noise were\n      not rather produced by my own imagination. I say it seemed to\n      resemble sobbing or sighing—but, of course, it could not have\n      been either. I rather think it was a ringing in my own ears. Mr.\n      Wyatt, no doubt, according to custom, was merely giving the rein\n      to one of his hobbies—indulging in one of his fits of artistic\r\nenthusiasm. He had opened his oblong box, in order to feast his\n      eyes on the pictorial treasure within. There was nothing in this,\n      however, to make him sob. I repeat, therefore, that it must have\n      been simply a freak of my own fancy, distempered by good Captain\n      Hardy’s green tea. Just before dawn, on each of the two nights of\n      which I speak, I distinctly heard Mr. Wyatt replace the lid upon\n      the oblong box, and force the nails into their old places by\n      means of the muffled mallet. Having done this, he issued from his","state-room, fully dressed, and proceeded to call Mrs. W. from\n      hers.\n\n      We had been at sea seven days, and were now off Cape Hatteras,\n      when there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest. We\n      were, in a measure, prepared for it, however, as the weather had\n      been holding out threats for some time. Every thing was made\n      snug, alow and aloft; and as the wind steadily freshened, we lay\n      to, at length, under spanker and foretopsail, both double-reefed.\n\n      In this trim we rode safely enough for forty-eight hours—the ship\r\nproving herself an excellent sea-boat in many respects, and\n      shipping no water of any consequence. At the end of this period,\n      however, the gale had freshened into a hurricane, and our\n      after-sail split into ribbons, bringing us so much in the trough\n      of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas, one\n      immediately after the other. By this accident we lost three men\n      overboard with the caboose, and nearly the whole of the larboard\n      bulwarks. Scarcely had we recovered our senses, before the\r\nforetopsail went into shreds, when we got up a storm stay-sail\n      and with this did pretty well for some hours, the ship heading\n      the sea much more steadily than before.\n\n      The gale still held on, however, and we saw no signs of its\n      abating. The rigging was found to be ill-fitted, and greatly\n      strained; and on the third day of the blow, about five in the\n      afternoon, our mizzen-mast, in a heavy lurch to windward, went by\n      the board. For an hour or more, we tried in vain to get rid of\r\nit, on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship; and, before\n      we had succeeded, the carpenter came aft and announced four feet\n      of water in the hold. To add to our dilemma, we found the pumps\n      choked and nearly useless.\n\n      All was now confusion and despair—but an effort was made to\n      lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as\n      could be reached, and by cutting away the two masts that\n      remained. This we at last accomplished—but we were still unable\n      to do any thing at the pumps; and, in the meantime, the leak","gained on us very fast.\n\n      At sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and as\n      the sea went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of\n      saving ourselves in the boats. At eight P. M., the clouds broke\n      away to windward, and we had the advantage of a full moon—a piece\n      of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our drooping\n      spirits.\n\n      After incredible labor we succeeded, at length, in getting the\n      longboat over the side without material accident, and into this\r\nwe crowded the whole of the crew and most of the passengers. This\n      party made off immediately, and, after undergoing much suffering,\n      finally arrived, in safety, at Ocracoke Inlet, on the third day\n      after the wreck.\n\n      Fourteen passengers, with the captain, remained on board,\n      resolving to trust their fortunes to the jolly-boat at the stern.\n      We lowered it without difficulty, although it was only by a\n      miracle that we prevented it from swamping as it touched the\n      water. It contained, when afloat, the captain and his wife, Mr.\r\nWyatt and party, a Mexican officer, wife, four children, and\n      myself, with a negro valet.\n\n      We had no room, of course, for any thing except a few positively\n      necessary instruments, some provisions, and the clothes upon our\n      backs. No one had thought of even attempting to save any thing\n      more. What must have been the astonishment of all, then, when\n      having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship, Mr. Wyatt stood up\n      in the stern-sheets, and coolly demanded of Captain Hardy that\n      the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking in his\r\noblong box!\n\n      “Sit down, Mr. Wyatt,” replied the captain, somewhat sternly,\n      “you will capsize us if you do not sit quite still. Our gunwhale\n      is almost in the water now.”\n\n      “The box!” vociferated Mr. Wyatt, still standing—“the box, I say!\n      Captain Hardy, you cannot, you will not refuse me. Its weight\n      will be but a trifle—it is nothing—mere nothing. By the mother\n      who bore you—for the love of Heaven—by your hope of salvation, I\n      implore you to put back for the box!”","The captain, for a moment, seemed touched by the earnest appeal\n      of the artist, but he regained his stern composure, and merely\n      said:\n\n      “Mr. Wyatt, you are mad. I cannot listen to you. Sit down, I say,\n      or you will swamp the boat. Stay—hold him—seize him!—he is about\n      to spring overboard! There—I knew it—he is over!”\n\n      As the captain said this, Mr. Wyatt, in fact, sprang from the\n      boat, and, as we were yet in the lee of the wreck, succeeded, by\n      almost superhuman exertion, in getting hold of a rope which hung\r\nfrom the fore-chains. In another moment he was on board, and\n      rushing frantically down into the cabin.\n\n      In the meantime, we had been swept astern of the ship, and being\n      quite out of her lee, were at the mercy of the tremendous sea\n      which was still running. We made a determined effort to put back,\n      but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the\n      tempest. We saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate\n      artist was sealed.\n\n      As our distance from the wreck rapidly increased, the madman (for\r\nas such only could we regard him) was seen to emerge from the\n      companion—way, up which by dint of strength that appeared\n      gigantic, he dragged, bodily, the oblong box. While we gazed in\n      the extremity of astonishment, he passed, rapidly, several turns\n      of a three-inch rope, first around the box and then around his\n      body. In another instant both body and box were in the\n      sea—disappearing suddenly, at once and forever.\n\n      We lingered awhile sadly upon our oars, with our eyes riveted\r\nupon the spot. At length we pulled away. The silence remained\n      unbroken for an hour. Finally, I hazarded a remark.\n\n      “Did you observe, captain, how suddenly they sank? Was not that\n      an exceedingly singular thing? I confess that I entertained some\n      feeble hope of his final deliverance, when I saw him lash himself\n      to the box, and commit himself to the sea.”\n\n      “They sank as a matter of course,” replied the captain, “and that\n      like a shot. They will soon rise again, however—but not till the\n      salt melts.”\n\n      “The salt!” I ejaculated.","“Hush!” said the captain, pointing to the wife and sisters of the\n      deceased. “We must talk of these things at some more appropriate\n      time.”\n\n      We suffered much, and made a narrow escape; but fortune\n      befriended us, as well as our mates in the long-boat. We landed,\n      in fine, more dead than alive, after four days of intense\n      distress, upon the beach opposite Roanoke Island. We remained\n      here a week, were not ill-treated by the wreckers, and at length\n      obtained a passage to New York.\n\n      About a month after the loss of the “Independence,” I happened to\r\nmeet Captain Hardy in Broadway. Our conversation turned,\n      naturally, upon the disaster, and especially upon the sad fate of\n      poor Wyatt. I thus learned the following particulars.\n\n      The artist had engaged passage for himself, wife, two sisters and\n      a servant. His wife was, indeed, as she had been represented, a\n      most lovely, and most accomplished woman. On the morning of the\n      fourteenth of June (the day in which I first visited the ship),\n      the lady suddenly sickened and died. The young husband was\r\nfrantic with grief—but circumstances imperatively forbade the\n      deferring his voyage to New York. It was necessary to take to her\n      mother the corpse of his adored wife, and, on the other hand, the\n      universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so openly was\n      well known. Nine-tenths of the passengers would have abandoned\n      the ship rather than take passage with a dead body.\n\n      In this dilemma, Captain Hardy arranged that the corpse, being\n      first partially embalmed, and packed, with a large quantity of\r\nsalt, in a box of suitable dimensions, should be conveyed on\n      board as merchandise. Nothing was to be said of the lady’s\n      decease; and, as it was well understood that Mr. Wyatt had\n      engaged passage for his wife, it became necessary that some\n      person should personate her during the voyage. This the deceased\n      lady’s-maid was easily prevailed on to do. The extra state-room,\n      originally engaged for this girl during her mistress’ life, was\n      now merely retained. In this state-room the pseudo-wife, slept,","of course, every night. In the daytime she performed, to the best\n      of her ability, the part of her mistress—whose person, it had\n      been carefully ascertained, was unknown to any of the passengers\n      on board.\n\n      My own mistake arose, naturally enough, through too careless, too\n      inquisitive, and too impulsive a temperament. But of late, it is\n      a rare thing that I sleep soundly at night. There is a\n      countenance which haunts me, turn as I will. There is an\n      hysterical laugh which will forever ring within my ears.\r\nLOSS OF BREATH\n\n\nO breathe not, etc.\n                    —Moore’s _Melodies_\n\n      The most notorious ill-fortune must in the end yield to the\n      untiring courage of philosophy—as the most stubborn city to the\n      ceaseless vigilance of an enemy. Shalmanezer, as we have it in\n      holy writings, lay three years before Samaria; yet it fell.\n      Sardanapalus—see Diodorus—maintained himself seven in Nineveh;\n      but to no purpose.

Imagine—that is if you\n      have a fanciful turn—imagine, I say, my wonder—my\n      consternation—my despair!","There is a good genius, however, which has never entirely\n      deserted me. In my most ungovernable moods I still retain a sense\n      of propriety, _et le chemin des passions me conduit_—as Lord\n      Edouard in the “Julie” says it did him—_à la philosophie\n      véritable_.\n\n      Although I could not at first precisely ascertain to what degree\n      the occurrence had affected me, I determined at all events to\n      conceal the matter from my wife, until further experience should\n      discover to me the extent of this my unheard of calamity.\r\nAltering my countenance, therefore, in a moment, from its\n      bepuffed and distorted appearance, to an expression of arch and\n      coquettish benignity, I gave my lady a pat on the one cheek, and\n      a kiss on the other, and without saying one syllable (Furies! I\n      could not), left her astonished at my drollery, as I pirouetted\n      out of the room in a _pas de zephyr_.\n\n      Behold me then safely ensconced in my private boudoir, a fearful\n      instance of the ill consequences attending upon\n      irascibility—alive, with the qualifications of the dead—dead,\r\nwith the propensities of the living—an anomaly on the face of the\n      earth—being very calm, yet breathless.\n\n      Yes! breathless. I am serious in asserting that my breath was\n      entirely gone. I could not have stirred with it a feather if my\n      life had been at issue, or sullied even the delicacy of a mirror.\n      Hard fate!—yet there was some alleviation to the first\n      overwhelming paroxysm of my sorrow. I found, upon trial, that the\n      powers of utterance which, upon my inability to proceed in the\r\nconversation with my wife, I then concluded to be totally\n      destroyed, were in fact only partially impeded, and I discovered\n      that had I, at that interesting crisis, dropped my voice to a\n      singularly deep guttural, I might still have continued to her the\n      communication of my sentiments; this pitch of voice (the\n      guttural) depending, I find, not upon the current of the breath,\n      but upon a certain spasmodic action of the muscles of the throat.\n\n      Throwing myself upon a chair, I remained for some time absorbed","in meditation. My reflections, be sure, were of no consolatory\n      kind. A thousand vague and lachrymatory fancies took possession\n      of my soul—and even the idea of suicide flitted across my brain;\n      but it is a trait in the perversity of human nature to reject the\n      obvious and the ready, for the far-distant and equivocal. Thus I\n      shuddered at self-murder as the most decided of atrocities while\n      the tabby cat purred strenuously upon the rug, and the very\n      water-dog wheezed assiduously under the table, each taking to\r\nitself much merit for the strength of its lungs, and all\n      obviously done in derision of my own pulmonary incapacity.\n\n      Oppressed with a tumult of vague hopes and fears, I at length\n      heard the footsteps of my wife descending the staircase. Being\n      now assured of her absence, I returned with a palpitating heart\n      to the scene of my disaster.\n\n      Carefully locking the door on the inside, I commenced a vigorous\n      search. It was possible, I thought, that, concealed in some\n      obscure corner, or lurking in some closet or drawer, might be\r\nfound the lost object of my inquiry. It might have a vapory—it\n      might even have a tangible form. Most philosophers, upon many\n      points of philosophy, are still very unphilosophical. William\n      Godwin, however, says in his “Mandeville,” that “invisible things\n      are the only realities,” and this, all will allow, is a case in\n      point. I would have the judicious reader pause before accusing\n      such asseverations of an undue quantum of absurdity. Anaxagoras,\n      it will be remembered, maintained that snow is black, and this I\r\nhave since found to be the case.\n\n      Long and earnestly did I continue the investigation: but the\n      contemptible reward of my industry and perseverance proved to be\n      only a set of false teeth, two pair of hips, an eye, and a bundle\n      of billets-doux from Mr. Windenough to my wife. I might as well\n      here observe that this confirmation of my lady’s partiality for\n      Mr. W. occasioned me little uneasiness. That Mrs. Lackobreath\n      should admire anything so dissimilar to myself was a natural and","necessary evil. I am, it is well known, of a robust and corpulent\n      appearance, and at the same time somewhat diminutive in stature.\n      What wonder, then, that the lath-like tenuity of my acquaintance,\n      and his altitude, which has grown into a proverb, should have met\n      with all due estimation in the eyes of Mrs. Lackobreath. But to\n      return.\n\n      My exertions, as I have before said, proved fruitless. Closet\n      after closet—drawer after drawer—corner after corner—were\n      scrutinized to no purpose. At one time, however, I thought myself\r\nsure of my prize, having, in rummaging a dressing-case,\n      accidentally demolished a bottle of Grandjean’s Oil of\n      Archangels—which, as an agreeable perfume, I here take the\n      liberty of recommending.\n\n      With a heavy heart I returned to my boudoir—there to ponder upon\n      some method of eluding my wife’s penetration, until I could make\n      arrangements prior to my leaving the country, for to this I had\n      already made up my mind. In a foreign climate, being unknown, I\n      might, with some probability of success, endeavor to conceal my\r\nunhappy calamity—a calamity calculated, even more than beggary,\n      to estrange the affections of the multitude, and to draw down\n      upon the wretch the well-merited indignation of the virtuous and\n      the happy. I was not long in hesitation. Being naturally quick, I\n      committed to memory the entire tragedy of “Metamora.” I had the\n      good fortune to recollect that in the accentuation of this drama,\n      or at least of such portion of it as is allotted to the hero, the\n      tones of voice in which I found myself deficient were altogether\r\nunnecessary, and the deep guttural was expected to reign\n      monotonously throughout.\n\n      I practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented\n      marsh;—herein, however, having no reference to a similar\n      proceeding of Demosthenes, but from a design peculiarly and\n      conscientiously my own. Thus armed at all points, I determined to\n      make my wife believe that I was suddenly smitten with a passion\n      for the stage. In this, I succeeded to a miracle; and to every\n      question or suggestion found myself at liberty to reply in my","most frog-like and sepulchral tones with some passage from the\n      tragedy—any portion of which, as I soon took great pleasure in\n      observing, would apply equally well to any particular subject. It\n      is not to be supposed, however, that in the delivery of such\n      passages I was found at all deficient in the looking asquint—the\n      showing my teeth—the working my knees—the shuffling my feet—or in\n      any of those unmentionable graces which are now justly considered\n      the characteristics of a popular performer. To be sure they spoke\r\nof confining me in a strait-jacket—but, good God! they never\n      suspected me of having lost my breath.\n\n      Having at length put my affairs in order, I took my seat very\n      early one morning in the mail stage for ——, giving it to be\n      understood, among my acquaintances, that business of the last\n      importance required my immediate personal attendance in that\n      city.\n\n      The coach was crammed to repletion; but in the uncertain twilight\n      the features of my companions could not be distinguished. Without\r\nmaking any effectual resistance, I suffered myself to be placed\n      between two gentlemen of colossal dimensions; while a third, of a\n      size larger, requesting pardon for the liberty he was about to\n      take, threw himself upon my body at full length, and falling\n      asleep in an instant, drowned all my guttural ejaculations for\n      relief, in a snore which would have put to blush the roarings of\n      the bull of Phalaris. Happily the state of my respiratory\n      faculties rendered suffocation an accident entirely out of the\n      question.\r\nAs, however, the day broke more distinctly in our approach to the\n      outskirts of the city, my tormentor, arising and adjusting his\n      shirt-collar, thanked me in a very friendly manner for my\n      civility. Seeing that I remained motionless (all my limbs were\n      dislocated and my head twisted on one side), his apprehensions\n      began to be excited; and arousing the rest of the passengers, he\n      communicated, in a very decided manner, his opinion that a dead\n      man had been palmed upon them during the night for a living and","responsible fellow-traveller; here giving me a thump on the right\n      eye, by way of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion.\n\n      Hereupon all, one after another (there were nine in company),\n      believed it their duty to pull me by the ear. A young practising\n      physician, too, having applied a pocket-mirror to my mouth, and\n      found me without breath, the assertion of my persecutor was\n      pronounced a true bill; and the whole party expressed a\n      determination to endure tamely no such impositions for the\r\nfuture, and to proceed no farther with any such carcasses for the\n      present.\n\n      I was here, accordingly, thrown out at the sign of the “Crow” (by\n      which tavern the coach happened to be passing), without meeting\n      with any farther accident than the breaking of both my arms,\n      under the left hind wheel of the vehicle. I must besides do the\n      driver the justice to state that he did not forget to throw after\n      me the largest of my trunks, which, unfortunately falling on my\n      head, fractured my skull in a manner at once interesting and\n      extraordinary.\r\nThe landlord of the “Crow,” who is a hospitable man, finding that\n      my trunk contained sufficient to indemnify him for any little\n      trouble he might take in my behalf, sent forthwith for a surgeon\n      of his acquaintance, and delivered me to his care with a bill and\n      receipt for ten dollars.\n\n      The purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced operations\n      immediately. Having cut off my ears, however, he discovered signs\n      of animation. He now rang the bell, and sent for a neighboring\n      apothecary with whom to consult in the emergency. In case of his\r\nsuspicions with regard to my existence proving ultimately\n      correct, he, in the meantime, made an incision in my stomach, and\n      removed several of my viscera for private dissection.\n\n      The apothecary had an idea that I was actually dead. This idea I\n      endeavored to confute, kicking and plunging with all my might,\n      and making the most furious contortions—for the operations of the\n      surgeon had, in a measure, restored me to the possession of my\n      faculties. All, however, was attributed to the effects of a new","galvanic battery, wherewith the apothecary, who is really a man\n      of information, performed several curious experiments, in which,\n      from my personal share in their fulfillment, I could not help\n      feeling deeply interested. It was a course of mortification to\n      me, nevertheless, that although I made several attempts at\n      conversation, my powers of speech were so entirely in abeyance,\n      that I could not even open my mouth; much less, then, make reply\n      to some ingenious but fanciful theories of which, under other\r\ncircumstances, my minute acquaintance with the Hippocratian\n      pathology would have afforded me a ready confutation.\n\n      Not being able to arrive at a conclusion, the practitioners\n      remanded me for farther examination. I was taken up into a\n      garret; and the surgeon’s lady having accommodated me with\n      drawers and stockings, the surgeon himself fastened my hands, and\n      tied up my jaws with a pocket-handkerchief—then bolted the door\n      on the outside as he hurried to his dinner, leaving me alone to\n      silence and to meditation.\r\nI now discovered to my extreme delight that I could have spoken\n      had not my mouth been tied up with the pocket-handkerchief.\n      Consoling myself with this reflection, I was mentally repeating\n      some passages of the “Omnipresence of the Deity,” as is my custom\n      before resigning myself to sleep, when two cats, of a greedy and\n      vituperative turn, entering at a hole in the wall, leaped up with\n      a flourish a la Catalani, and alighting opposite one another on\n      my visage, betook themselves to indecorous contention for the\r\npaltry consideration of my nose.\n\n      But, as the loss of his ears proved the means of elevating to the\n      throne of Cyrus, the Magian or Mige-Gush of Persia, and as the\n      cutting off his nose gave Zopyrus possession of Babylon, so the\n      loss of a few ounces of my countenance proved the salvation of my\n      body. Aroused by the pain, and burning with indignation, I burst,\n      at a single effort, the fastenings and the bandage. Stalking\n      across the room I cast a glance of contempt at the belligerents,","and throwing open the sash to their extreme horror and\n      disappointment, precipitated myself, very dexterously, from the\n      window.\n\n      The mail-robber W——, to whom I bore a singular resemblance, was\n      at this moment passing from the city jail to the scaffold erected\n      for his execution in the suburbs. His extreme infirmity and long\n      continued ill health had obtained him the privilege of remaining\n      unmanacled; and habited in his gallows costume—one very similar\n      to my own,—he lay at full length in the bottom of the hangman’s\r\ncart (which happened to be under the windows of the surgeon at\n      the moment of my precipitation) without any other guard than the\n      driver, who was asleep, and two recruits of the sixth infantry,\n      who were drunk.\n\n      As ill-luck would have it, I alit upon my feet within the\n      vehicle. W——, who was an acute fellow, perceived his opportunity.\n      Leaping up immediately, he bolted out behind, and turning down an\n      alley, was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye. The recruits,\r\naroused by the bustle, could not exactly comprehend the merits of\n      the transaction. Seeing, however, a man, the precise counterpart\n      of the felon, standing upright in the cart before their eyes,\n      they were of the opinion that the rascal (meaning W——) was after\n      making his escape, (so they expressed themselves), and, having\n      communicated this opinion to one another, they took each a dram,\n      and then knocked me down with the butt-ends of their muskets.\n\n      It was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination. Of\r\ncourse nothing could be said in my defence. Hanging was my\n      inevitable fate. I resigned myself thereto with a feeling half\n      stupid, half acrimonious. Being little of a cynic, I had all the\n      sentiments of a dog. The hangman, however, adjusted the noose\n      about my neck. The drop fell.\n\n      I forbear to depict my sensations upon the gallows; although\n      here, undoubtedly, I could speak to the point, and it is a topic\n      upon which nothing has been well said. In fact, to write upon\n      such a theme it is necessary to have been hanged. Every author","should confine himself to matters of experience. Thus Mark Antony\n      composed a treatise upon getting drunk.\n\n      I may just mention, however, that die I did not. My body was, but\n      I had no breath to be, suspended; and but for the knot under my\n      left ear (which had the feel of a military stock) I dare say that\n      I should have experienced very little inconvenience. As for the\n      jerk given to my neck upon the falling of the drop, it merely\n      proved a corrective to the twist afforded me by the fat gentleman\n      in the coach.\r\nFor good reasons, however, I did my best to give the crowd the\n      worth of their trouble. My convulsions were said to be\n      extraordinary. My spasms it would have been difficult to beat.\n      The populace encored. Several gentlemen swooned; and a multitude\n      of ladies were carried home in hysterics. Pinxit availed himself\n      of the opportunity to retouch, from a sketch taken upon the spot,\n      his admirable painting of the “Marsyas flayed alive.”\n\n      When I had afforded sufficient amusement, it was thought proper\r\nto remove my body from the gallows;—this the more especially as\n      the real culprit had in the meantime been retaken and recognized,\n      a fact which I was so unlucky as not to know.\n\n      Much sympathy was, of course, exercised in my behalf, and as no\n      one made claim to my corpse, it was ordered that I should be\n      interred in a public vault.\n\n      Here, after due interval, I was deposited. The sexton departed,\n      and I was left alone. A line of Marston’s “Malcontent”—\n\n      Death’s a good fellow and keeps open house—\r\nstruck me at that moment as a palpable lie.\n\n      I knocked off, however, the lid of my coffin, and stepped out.\n      The place was dreadfully dreary and damp, and I became troubled\n      with ennui. By way of amusement, I felt my way among the numerous\n      coffins ranged in order around. I lifted them down, one by one,\n      and breaking open their lids, busied myself in speculations about\n      the mortality within.\n\n      “This,” I soliloquized, tumbling over a carcass, puffy, bloated,\n      and rotund—“this has been, no doubt, in every sense of the word,","an unhappy—an unfortunate man. It has been his terrible lot not\n      to walk but to waddle—to pass through life not like a human\n      being, but like an elephant—not like a man, but like a\n      rhinoceros.\n\n      “His attempts at getting on have been mere abortions, and his\n      circumgyratory proceedings a palpable failure. Taking a step\n      forward, it has been his misfortune to take two toward the right,\n      and three toward the left. His studies have been confined to the\n      poetry of Crabbe. He can have no idea of the wonder of a\r\npirouette. To him a pas de papillon has been an abstract\n      conception. He has never ascended the summit of a hill. He has\n      never viewed from any steeple the glories of a metropolis. Heat\n      has been his mortal enemy. In the dog-days his days have been the\n      days of a dog. Therein, he has dreamed of flames and\n      suffocation—of mountains upon mountains—of Pelion upon Ossa. He\n      was short of breath—to say all in a word, he was short of breath.\n      He thought it extravagant to play upon wind instruments. He was\r\nthe inventor of self-moving fans, wind-sails, and ventilators. He\n      patronized Du Pont the bellows-maker, and he died miserably in\n      attempting to smoke a cigar. His was a case in which I feel a\n      deep interest—a lot in which I sincerely sympathize.\n\n      “But here,”—said I—“here”—and I dragged spitefully from its\n      receptacle a gaunt, tall and peculiar-looking form, whose\n      remarkable appearance struck me with a sense of unwelcome\n      familiarity—“here is a wretch entitled to no earthly\n      commiseration.” Thus saying, in order to obtain a more distinct\r\nview of my subject, I applied my thumb and forefinger to its\n      nose, and causing it to assume a sitting position upon the\n      ground, held it thus, at the length of my arm, while I continued\n      my soliloquy.\n\n      “Entitled,” I repeated, “to no earthly commiseration. Who indeed\n      would think of compassioning a shadow? Besides, has he not had\n      his full share of the blessings of mortality? He was the\n      originator of tall monuments—shot-towers—lightning-rods—Lombardy\n      poplars. His treatise upon “Shades and Shadows” has immortalized","him. He edited with distinguished ability the last edition of\n      “South on the Bones.” He went early to college and studied\n      pneumatics. He then came home, talked eternally, and played upon\n      the French-horn. He patronized the bagpipes. Captain Barclay, who\n      walked against Time, would not walk against him. Windham and\n      Allbreath were his favorite writers,—his favorite artist, Phiz.\n      He died gloriously while inhaling gas—levique flatu corrupitur,\n      like the fama pudicitae in Hieronymus. {*1} He was indubitably\n      a—”\r\n“How can you?—how—can—you?”—interrupted the object of my\nanimadversions, gasping for breath, and tearing off, with a desperate\nexertion, the bandage around its jaws—“how can you, Mr. Lackobreath, be\nso infernally cruel as to pinch me in that manner by the nose? Did you\nnot see how they had fastened up my mouth—and you must know—if you know\nany thing—how vast a superfluity of breath I have to dispose of! If you\ndo not know, however, sit down and you shall see. In my situation it is\nreally a great relief to be able to open ones mouth—to be able to\r\nexpatiate—to be able to communicate with a person like yourself, who do\nnot think yourself called upon at every period to interrupt the thread\nof a gentleman’s discourse. Interruptions are annoying and should\nundoubtedly be abolished—don’t you think so?—no reply, I beg you,—one\nperson is enough to be speaking at a time.—I shall be done by and by,\nand then you may begin.—How the devil sir, did you get into this\nplace?—not a word I beseech you—been here some time myself—terrible\naccident!—heard of it, I suppose?—awful calamity!—walking under your\r\nwindows—some short while ago—about the time you were\nstage-struck—horrible occurrence!—heard of “catching one’s breath,”\neh?—hold your tongue I tell you!—I caught somebody else’s!—had always\ntoo much of my own—met Blab at the corner of the street—wouldn’t give\nme a chance for a word—couldn’t get in a syllable edgeways—attacked,\nconsequently, with epilepsis—Blab made his escape—damn all fools!—they\ntook me up for dead, and put me in this place—pretty doings all of\nthem!—heard all you said about me—every word a\nlie—horrible!—wonderful!—outrageous!—hideous!—incomprehensible!—et","cetera—et cetera—et cetera—et cetera—”\n\n      It is impossible to conceive my astonishment at so unexpected a\n      discourse, or the joy with which I became gradually convinced\n      that the breath so fortunately caught by the gentleman (whom I\n      soon recognized as my neighbor Windenough) was, in fact, the\n      identical expiration mislaid by myself in the conversation with\n      my wife. Time, place, and circumstances rendered it a matter\n      beyond question. I did not, however, immediately release my hold\r\nupon Mr. W.’s proboscis—not at least during the long period in\n      which the inventor of Lombardy poplars continued to favor me with\n      his explanations.\n\n      In this respect I was actuated by that habitual prudence which\n      has ever been my predominating trait. I reflected that many\n      difficulties might still lie in the path of my preservation which\n      only extreme exertion on my part would be able to surmount. Many\n      persons, I considered, are prone to estimate commodities in their\n      possession—however valueless to the then proprietor—however\r\ntroublesome, or distressing—in direct ratio with the advantages\n      to be derived by others from their attainment, or by themselves\n      from their abandonment. Might not this be the case with Mr.\n      Windenough? In displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was\n      at present so willing to get rid, might I not lay myself open to\n      the exactions of his avarice? There are scoundrels in this world,\n      I remembered with a sigh, who will not scruple to take unfair\n      opportunities with even a next door neighbor, and (this remark is\r\nfrom Epictetus) it is precisely at that time when men are most\n      anxious to throw off the burden of their own calamities that they\n      feel the least desirous of relieving them in others.\n\n      Upon considerations similar to these, and still retaining my\n      grasp upon the nose of Mr. W., I accordingly thought proper to\n      model my reply.\n\n      “Monster!” I began in a tone of the deepest indignation—“monster\n      and double-winded idiot!—dost thou, whom for thine iniquities it\n      has pleased heaven to accurse with a two-fold respimtion—dost","thou, I say, presume to address me in the familiar language of an\n      old acquaintance?—‘I lie,’ forsooth! and ‘hold my tongue,’ to be\n      sure!—pretty conversation indeed, to a gentleman with a single\n      breath!—all this, too, when I have it in my power to relieve the\n      calamity under which thou dost so justly suffer—to curtail the\n      superfluities of thine unhappy respiration.”\n\n      Like Brutus, I paused for a reply—with which, like a tornado, Mr.\n      Windenough immediately overwhelmed me. Protestation followed upon\r\nprotestation, and apology upon apology. There were no terms with\n      which he was unwilling to comply, and there were none of which I\n      failed to take the fullest advantage.\n\n      Preliminaries being at length arranged, my acquaintance delivered\n      me the respiration; for which (having carefully examined it) I\n      gave him afterward a receipt.\n\n      I am aware that by many I shall be held to blame for speaking in\n      a manner so cursory, of a transaction so impalpable. It will be\n      thought that I should have entered more minutely, into the\r\ndetails of an occurrence by which—and this is very true—much new\n      light might be thrown upon a highly interesting branch of\n      physical philosophy.\n\n      To all this I am sorry that I cannot reply. A hint is the only\n      answer which I am permitted to make. There were circumstances—but\n      I think it much safer upon consideration to say as little as\n      possible about an affair so delicate—so delicate, I repeat, and\n      at the time involving the interests of a third party whose\n      sulphurous resentment I have not the least desire, at this\r\nmoment, of incurring.\n\n      We were not long after this necessary arrangement in effecting an\n      escape from the dungeons of the sepulchre. The united strength of\n      our resuscitated voices was soon sufficiently apparent. Scissors,\n      the Whig editor, republished a treatise upon “the nature and\n      origin of subterranean noises.” A reply—rejoinder—confutation—and\n      justification—followed in the columns of a Democratic gazette. It\n      was not until the opening of the vault to decide the controversy,","that the appearance of Mr. Windenough and myself proved both\n      parties to have been decidedly in the wrong.\n\n      I cannot conclude these details of some very singular passages in\n      a life at all times sufficiently eventful, without again\n      recalling to the attention of the reader the merits of that\n      indiscriminate philosophy which is a sure and ready shield\n      against those shafts of calamity which can neither be seen, felt\n      nor fully understood. It was in the spirit of this wisdom that,\r\namong the ancient Hebrews, it was believed the gates of Heaven\n      would be inevitably opened to that sinner, or saint, who, with\n      good lungs and implicit confidence, should vociferate the word\n      “Amen!” It was in the spirit of this wisdom that, when a great\n      plague raged at Athens, and every means had been in vain\n      attempted for its removal, Epimenides, as Laërtius relates, in\n      his second book, of that philosopher, advised the erection of a\n      shrine and temple “to the proper God.”\n\n      LYTTLETON BARRY.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN THAT WAS USED UP\r\nA TALE OF THE LATE BUGABOO AND KICKAPOO CAMPAIGN.\n\n\n     _Pleurez, pleurez, mes yeux, et fondez vous en eau!_\n     _La moitié de ma vie a mis l’ autre au tombeau._\n                    —CORNEILLE.\n\n      I cannot just now remember when or where I first made the\n      acquaintance of that truly fine-looking fellow, Brevet Brigadier\n      General John A. B. C. Smith. Some one _did_ introduce me to the\n      gentleman, I am sure—at some public meeting, I know very\n      well—held about something of great importance, no doubt—at some\r\nplace or other, I feel convinced,—whose name I have unaccountably\n      forgotten. The truth is—that the introduction was attended, upon\n      my part, with a degree of anxious embarrassment which operated to\n      prevent any definite impressions of either time or place. I am\n      constitutionally nervous—this, with me, is a family failing, and\n      I can’t help it. In especial, the slightest appearance of\n      mystery—of any point I cannot exactly comprehend—puts me at once\n      into a pitiable state of agitation.\n\n      There was something, as it were, remarkable—yes, _remarkable_,","although this is but a feeble term to express my full\n      meaning—about the entire individuality of the personage in\n      question. He was, perhaps, six feet in height, and of a presence\n      singularly commanding. There was an _air distingué_ pervading the\n      whole man, which spoke of high breeding, and hinted at high\n      birth. Upon this topic—the topic of Smith’s personal appearance—I\n      have a kind of melancholy satisfaction in being minute. His head\n      of hair would have done honor to a Brutus; nothing could be more\r\nrichly flowing, or possess a brighter gloss. It was of a jetty\n      black;—which was also the color, or more properly the no color of\n      his unimaginable whiskers. You perceive I cannot speak of these\n      latter without enthusiasm; it is not too much to say that they\n      were the handsomest pair of whiskers under the sun. At all\n      events, they encircled, and at times partially overshadowed, a\n      mouth utterly unequalled. Here were the most entirely even, and\n      the most brilliantly white of all conceivable teeth. From between\r\nthem, upon every proper occasion, issued a voice of surpassing\n      clearness, melody, and strength. In the matter of eyes, also, my\n      acquaintance was pre-eminently endowed. Either one of such a pair\n      was worth a couple of the ordinary ocular organs. They were of a\n      deep hazel, exceedingly large and lustrous; and there was\n      perceptible about them, ever and anon, just that amount of\n      interesting obliquity which gives pregnancy to expression.\n\n      The bust of the General was unquestionably the finest bust I ever\r\nsaw. For your life you could not have found a fault with its\n      wonderful proportion. This rare peculiarity set off to great\n      advantage a pair of shoulders which would have called up a blush\n      of conscious inferiority into the countenance of the marble\n      Apollo. I have a passion for fine shoulders, and may say that I\n      never beheld them in perfection before. The arms altogether were\n      admirably modelled. Nor were the lower limbs less superb. These\n      were, indeed, the _ne plus ultra_ of good legs. Every connoisseur","in such matters admitted the legs to be good. There was neither\n      too much flesh, nor too little,—neither rudeness nor fragility. I\n      could not imagine a more graceful curve than that of the _os\n      femoris_, and there was just that due gentle prominence in the\n      rear of the _fibula_ which goes to the conformation of a properly\n      proportioned calf. I wish to God my young and talented friend\n      Chiponchipino, the sculptor, had but seen the legs of Brevet\n      Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith.\n\n      But although men so absolutely fine-looking are neither as plenty\r\nas reasons or blackberries, still I could not bring myself to\n      believe that _the remarkable_ something to which I alluded just\n      now,—that the odd air of _je ne sais quoi_ which hung about my\n      new acquaintance,—lay altogether, or indeed at all, in the\n      supreme excellence of his bodily endowments. Perhaps it might be\n      traced to the _manner_;—yet here again I could not pretend to be\n      positive. There _was_ a primness, not to say stiffness, in his\n      carriage—a degree of measured, and, if I may so express it, of\r\nrectangular precision, attending his every movement, which,\n      observed in a more diminutive figure, would have had the least\n      little savor in the world, of affectation, pomposity or\n      constraint, but which noticed in a gentleman of his undoubted\n      dimensions, was readily placed to the account of reserve,\n      _hauteur_—of a commendable sense, in short, of what is due to the\n      dignity of colossal proportion.\n\n      The kind friend who presented me to General Smith whispered in my\n      ear some few words of comment upon the man. He was a _remarkable_\r\nman—a _very_ remarkable man—indeed one of the _most_ remarkable\n      men of the age. He was an especial favorite, too, with the\n      ladies—chiefly on account of his high reputation for courage.\n\n      “In _that_ point he is unrivalled—indeed he is a perfect\n      desperado—a down-right fire-eater, and no mistake,” said my\n      friend, here dropping his voice excessively low, and thrilling me\n      with the mystery of his tone.\n\n      “A downright fire-eater, and _no_ mistake. Showed _that_, I","should say, to some purpose, in the late tremendous swamp-fight\n      away down South, with the Bugaboo and Kickapoo Indians.” [Here my\n      friend opened his eyes to some extent.] “Bless my soul!—blood and\n      thunder, and all that!—_prodigies_ of valor!—heard of him of\n      course?—you know he’s the man—”\n\n      “Man alive, how _do_ you do? why, how _are_ ye? _very_ glad to\n      see ye, indeed!” here interrupted the General himself, seizing my\n      companion by the hand as he drew near, and bowing stiffly, but\n      profoundly, as I was presented. I then thought, (and I think so\r\nstill,) that I never heard a clearer nor a stronger voice, nor\n      beheld a finer set of teeth: but I _must_ say that I was sorry\n      for the interruption just at that moment, as, owing to the\n      whispers and insinuations aforesaid, my interest had been greatly\n      excited in the hero of the Bugaboo and Kickapoo campaign.\n\n      However, the delightfully luminous conversation of Brevet\n      Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith soon completely dissipated\n      this chagrin. My friend leaving us immediately, we had quite a\r\nlong _tête-à-tête_, and I was not only pleased but\n      _really_—instructed. I never heard a more fluent talker, or a man\n      of greater general information. With becoming modesty, he\n      forebore, nevertheless, to touch upon the theme I had just then\n      most at heart—I mean the mysterious circumstances attending the\n      Bugaboo war—and, on my own part, what I conceive to be a proper\n      sense of delicacy forbade me to broach the subject; although, in\n      truth, I was exceedingly tempted to do so. I perceived, too, that\r\nthe gallant soldier preferred topics of philosophical interest,\n      and that he delighted, especially, in commenting upon the rapid\n      march of mechanical invention. Indeed, lead him where I would,\n      this was a point to which he invariably came back.\n\n      “There is nothing at all like it,” he would say; “we are a\n      wonderful people, and live in a wonderful age. Parachutes and\n      rail-roads—man-traps and spring-guns! Our steam-boats are upon\n      every sea, and the Nassau balloon packet is about to run regular","trips (fare either way only twenty pounds sterling) between\n      London and Timbuctoo. And who shall calculate the immense\n      influence upon social life—upon arts—upon commerce—upon\n      literature—which will be the immediate result of the great\n      principles of electro-magnetics! Nor, is this all, let me assure\n      you! There is really no end to the march of invention. The most\n      wonderful—the most ingenious—and let me add, Mr.—Mr.—Thompson, I\n      believe, is your name—let me add, I say, the most _useful_—the\r\nmost truly _useful_—mechanical contrivances, are daily springing\n      up like mushrooms, if I may so express myself, or, more\n      figuratively, like—ah—grasshoppers—like grasshoppers, Mr.\n      Thompson—about us and ah—ah—ah—around us!”\n\n      Thompson, to be sure, is not my name; but it is needless to say\n      that I left General Smith with a heightened interest in the man,\n      with an exalted opinion of his conversational powers, and a deep\n      sense of the valuable privileges we enjoy in living in this age\n      of mechanical invention. My curiosity, however, had not been\r\naltogether satisfied, and I resolved to prosecute immediate\n      inquiry among my acquaintances touching the Brevet Brigadier\n      General himself, and particularly respecting the tremendous\n      events _quorum pars magna fuit_, during the Bugaboo and Kickapoo\n      campaign.\n\n      The first opportunity which presented itself, and which\n      (_horresco referens_) I did not in the least scruple to seize,\n      occurred at the Church of the Reverend Doctor Drummummupp, where\n      I found myself established, one Sunday, just at sermon time, not\r\nonly in the pew, but by the side, of that worthy and\n      communicative little friend of mine, Miss Tabitha T. Thus seated,\n      I congratulated myself, and with much reason, upon the very\n      flattering state of affairs. If any person knew anything about\n      Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith, that person, it was\n      clear to me, was Miss Tabitha T. We telegraphed a few signals,\n      and then commenced, _sotto voce_, a brisk _tête-à-tête_.\n\n      “Smith!” said she, in reply to my very earnest inquiry;\n      “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.? Bless me, I thought you","_knew_ all about _him!_ This is a wonderfully inventive age!\n      Horrid affair that!—a bloody set of wretches, those\n      Kickapoos!—fought like a hero—prodigies of valor—immortal renown.\n      Smith!—Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C.! why, you know he’s\n      the man—”\n\n      “Man,” here broke in Doctor Drummummupp, at the top of his voice,\n      and with a thump that came near knocking the pulpit about our\n      ears—“man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live;\n      he cometh up and is cut down like a flower!” I started to the\r\nextremity of the pew, and perceived by the animated looks of the\n      divine, that the wrath which had nearly proved fatal to the\n      pulpit had been excited by the whispers of the lady and myself.\n      There was no help for it; so I submitted with a good grace, and\n      listened, in all the martyrdom of dignified silence, to the\n      balance of that very capital discourse.\n\n      Next evening found me a somewhat late visitor at the Rantipole\n      Theatre, where I felt sure of satisfying my curiosity at once, by\r\nmerely stepping into the box of those exquisite specimens of\n      affability and omniscience, the Misses Arabella and Miranda\n      Cognoscenti. That fine tragedian, Climax, was doing Iago to a\n      very crowded house, and I experienced some little difficulty in\n      making my wishes understood; especially, as our box was next the\n      slips, and completely overlooked the stage.\n\n      “Smith!” said Miss Arabella, as she at length comprehended the\n      purport of my query; “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.?”\n\n      “Smith!” inquired Miranda, musingly. “God bless me, did you ever\r\nbehold a finer figure?”\n\n      “Never, madam, but _do_ tell me—”\n\n      “Or so inimitable grace?”\n\n      “Never, upon my word!—But pray inform me—”\n\n      “Or so just an appreciation of stage effect?”\n\n      “Madam!”\n\n      “Or a more delicate sense of the true beauties of Shakespeare? Be\n      so good as to look at that leg!”\n\n      “The devil!” and I turned again to her sister.\n\n      “Smith!” said she, “why, not General John A. B. C.? Horrid affair\n      that, wasn’t it?—great wretches, those Bugaboos—savage and so","on—but we live in a wonderfully inventive age!—Smith!—O yes!\n      great man!—perfect desperado!—immortal renown!—prodigies of\n      valor! _Never heard!_” [This was given in a scream.] “Bless my\n      soul! why, he’s the man—”\n\n                         “——mandragora\n     Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world\n     Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\n     Which thou owd’st yesterday!”\n\n      here roared our Climax just in my ear, and shaking his fist in my\n      face all the time, in a way that I _couldn’t_ stand, and I\r\n_wouldn’t_. I left the Misses Cognoscenti immediately, went\n      behind the scenes forthwith, and gave the beggarly scoundrel such\n      a thrashing as I trust he will remember to the day of his death.\n\n      At the _soirée_ of the lovely widow, Mrs. Kathleen O’Trump, I was\n      confident that I should meet with no similar disappointment.\n      Accordingly, I was no sooner seated at the card-table, with my\n      pretty hostess for a _vis-à-vis_, than I propounded those\n      questions the solution of which had become a matter so essential\n      to my peace.\r\n“Smith!” said my partner, “why, not General John A. B. C.? Horrid\n      affair that, wasn’t it?—diamonds, did you say?—terrible wretches\n      those Kickapoos!—we are playing _whist_, if you please, Mr.\n      Tattle—however, this is the age of invention, most certainly\n      _the_ age, one may say—_the_ age _par excellence_—speak\n      French?—oh, quite a hero—perfect desperado!—_no hearts_, Mr.\n      Tattle? I don’t believe it.—immortal renown and all\n      that!—prodigies of valor! _Never heard!!_—why, bless me, he’s the\n      man—”\r\n“Mann!—_Captain_ Mann?” here screamed some little feminine\n      interloper from the farthest corner of the room. “Are you talking\n      about Captain Mann and the duel?—oh, I _must_ hear—do tell—go on,\n      Mrs. O’Trump!—do now go on!” And go on Mrs. O’Trump did—all about\n      a certain Captain Mann, who was either shot or hung, or should\n      have been both shot and hung. Yes! Mrs. O’Trump, she went on, and\n      I—I went off. There was no chance of hearing anything farther\n      that evening in regard to Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C.\n      Smith.","Still I consoled myself with the reflection that the tide of ill\n      luck would not run against me forever, and so determined to make\n      a bold push for information at the rout of that bewitching little\n      angel, the graceful Mrs. Pirouette.\n\n      “Smith!” said Mrs. P., as we twirled about together in a _pas de\n      zephyr_, “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.? Dreadful\n      business that of the Bugaboos, wasn’t it?—dreadful creatures,\n      those Indians!—_do_ turn out your toes! I really am ashamed of\r\nyou—man of great courage, poor fellow!—but this is a wonderful\n      age for invention—O dear me, I’m out of breath—quite a\n      desperado—prodigies of valor—_never heard!_—can’t believe it—I\n      shall have to sit down and enlighten you—Smith! why, he’s the\n      man—”\n\n      “Man-_Fred_, I tell you!” here bawled out Miss Bas-Bleu, as I led\n      Mrs. Pirouette to a seat. “Did ever anybody hear the like? It’s\n      Man-_Fred_, I say, and not at all by any means Man-_Friday_.”\n      Here Miss Bas-Bleu beckoned to me in a very peremptory manner;\r\nand I was obliged, will I nill I, to leave Mrs. P. for the\n      purpose of deciding a dispute touching the title of a certain\n      poetical drama of Lord Byron’s. Although I pronounced, with great\n      promptness, that the true title was Man-_Friday_, and not by any\n      means Man-_Fred_, yet when I returned to seek Mrs. Pirouette she\n      was not to be discovered, and I made my retreat from the house in\n      a very bitter spirit of animosity against the whole race of the\n      Bas-Bleus.\n\n      Matters had now assumed a really serious aspect, and I resolved\r\nto call at once upon my particular friend, Mr. Theodore Sinivate;\n      for I knew that here at least I should get something like\n      definite information.\n\n      “Smith!” said he, in his well-known peculiar way of drawling out\n      his syllables; “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.? Savage\n      affair that with the Kickapo-o-o-os, wasn’t it? Say! don’t you\n      think so?—perfect despera-a-ado—great pity, ‘pon my\n      honor!—wonderfully inventive age!—pro-o-odigies of valor! By the\n      by, did you ever hear about Captain Ma-a-a-a-n?”","“Captain Mann be d—d!” said I; “please to go on with your story.”\n\n      “Hem!—oh well!—quite _la même cho-o-ose_, as we say in France.\n      Smith, eh? Brigadier-General John A.—B.—C.? I say”—[here Mr. S.\n      thought proper to put his finger to the side of his nose]—“I say,\n      you don’t mean to insinuate now, really and truly, and\n      conscientiously, that you don’t know all about that affair of\n      Smith’s, as well as I do, eh? Smith? John A—B—C.? Why, bless me,\n      he’s the ma-a-an—”\n\n      “_Mr_. Sinivate,” said I, imploringly, “_is_ he the man in the\r\nmask?”\n\n      “No-o-o!” said he, looking wise, “nor the man in the mo-o-on.”\n\n      This reply I considered a pointed and positive insult, and so\n      left the house at once in high dudgeon, with a firm resolve to\n      call my friend, Mr. Sinivate, to a speedy account for his\n      ungentlemanly conduct and ill-breeding.\n\n      In the meantime, however, I had no notion of being thwarted\n      touching the information I desired. There was one resource left\n      me yet. I would go to the fountain-head. I would call forthwith\r\nupon the General himself, and demand, in explicit terms, a\n      solution of this abominable piece of mystery. Here, at least,\n      there should be no chance for equivocation. I would be plain,\n      positive, peremptory—as short as pie-crust—as concise as Tacitus\n      or Montesquieu.\n\n      It was early when I called, and the General was dressing; but I\n      pleaded urgent business, and was shown at once into his bed-room\n      by an old negro valet, who remained in attendance during my\n      visit. As I entered the chamber, I looked about, of course, for\r\nthe occupant, but did not immediately perceive him. There was a\n      large and exceedingly odd-looking bundle of something which lay\n      close by my feet on the floor, and, as I was not in the best\n      humor in the world, I gave it a kick out of the way.\n\n      “Hem! ahem! rather civil that, I should say!” said the bundle, in\n      one of the smallest, and altogether the funniest little voices,\n      between a squeak and a whistle, that I ever heard in all the days\n      of my existence.\n\n      “Ahem! rather civil that, I should observe.”","I fairly shouted with terror, and made off, at a tangent, into\n      the farthest extremity of the room.\n\n      “God bless me! my dear fellow,” here again whistled the bundle,\n      “what—what—what—why, what _is_ the matter? I really believe you\n      don’t know me at all.”\n\n      What _could_ I say to all this—what _could_ I? I staggered into\n      an arm-chair, and, with staring eyes and open mouth, awaited the\n      solution of the wonder.\n\n      “Strange you shouldn’t know me though, isn’t it?” presently\n      re-squeaked the nondescript, which I now perceived was\r\nperforming, upon the floor, some inexplicable evolution, very\n      analogous to the drawing on of a stocking. There was only a\n      single leg, however, apparent.\n\n      “Strange you shouldn’t know me, though, isn’t it? Pompey, bring\n      me that leg!” Here Pompey handed the bundle, a very capital cork\n      leg, already dressed, which it screwed on in a trice; and then it\n      stood up before my eyes.\n\n      “And a bloody action it _was_,” continued the thing, as if in a\n      soliloquy; “but then one mustn’t fight with the Bugaboos and\r\nKickapoos, and think of coming off with a mere scratch. Pompey,\n      I’ll thank you now for that arm. Thomas” [turning to me] “is\n      decidedly the best hand at a cork leg; but if you should ever\n      want an arm, my dear fellow, you must really let me recommend you\n      to Bishop.” Here Pompey screwed on an arm.\n\n      “We had rather hot work of it, that you may say. Now, you dog,\n      slip on my shoulders and bosom! Pettitt makes the best shoulders,\n      but for a bosom you will have to go to Ducrow.”\n\n      “Bosom!” said I.\r\n“Pompey, will you _never_ be ready with that wig? Scalping is a\n      rough process after all; but then you can procure such a capital\n      scratch at De L’Orme’s.”\n\n      “Scratch!”\n\n      “Now, you nigger, my teeth! For a _good_ set of these you had\n      better go to Parmly’s at once; high prices, but excellent work. I\n      swallowed some very capital articles, though, when the big\n      Bugaboo rammed me down with the butt end of his rifle.”\n\n      “Butt end! ram down!! my eye!!”\n\n      “O yes, by-the-by, my eye—here, Pompey, you scamp, screw it in !","Those Kickapoos are not so very slow at a gouge; but he’s a\n      belied man, that Dr. Williams, after all; you can’t imagine how\n      well I see with the eyes of his make.”\n\n      I now began very clearly to perceive that the object before me\n      was nothing more nor less than my new acquaintance, Brevet\n      Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith. The manipulations of\n      Pompey had made, I must confess, a very striking difference in\n      the appearance of the personal man. The voice, however, still\n      puzzled me no little; but even this apparent mystery was speedily\r\ncleared up.\n\n      “Pompey, you black rascal,” squeaked the General, “I really do\n      believe you would let me go out without my palate.”\n\n      Hereupon, the negro, grumbling out an apology, went up to his\n      master, opened his mouth with the knowing air of a horse-jockey,\n      and adjusted therein a somewhat singular-looking machine, in a\n      very dexterous manner, that I could not altogether comprehend.\n      The alteration, however, in the entire expression of the\n      General’s countenance was instantaneous and surprising. When he\r\nagain spoke, his voice had resumed all that rich melody and\n      strength which I had noticed upon our original introduction.\n\n      “D—n the vagabonds!” said he, in so clear a tone that I\n      positively started at the change, “D—n the vagabonds! they not\n      only knocked in the roof of my mouth, but took the trouble to cut\n      off at least seven-eighths of my tongue. There isn’t Bonfanti’s\n      equal, however, in America, for really good articles of this\n      description. I can recommend you to him with confidence,” [here\r\nthe General bowed,] “and assure you that I have the greatest\n      pleasure in so doing.”\n\n      I acknowledged his kindness in my best manner, and took leave of\n      him at once, with a perfect understanding of the true state of\n      affairs—with a full comprehension of the mystery which had\n      troubled me so long. It was evident. It was a clear case. Brevet\n      Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith was the man—was _the man\n      that was used up_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BUSINESS MAN\n\n\nMethod is the soul of business.—OLD SAYING.","I am a business man. I am a methodical man. Method is the thing,\n      after all. But there are no people I more heartily despise than\n      your eccentric fools who prate about method without understanding\n      it; attending strictly to its letter, and violating its spirit.\n      These fellows are always doing the most out-of-the-way things in\n      what they call an orderly manner. Now here, I conceive, is a\n      positive paradox. True method appertains to the ordinary and the\n      obvious alone, and cannot be applied to the _outré_. What\r\ndefinite idea can a body attach to such expressions as\n      “methodical Jack o’ Dandy,” or “a systematical Will o’ the Wisp”?\n\n      My notions upon this head might not have been so clear as they\n      are, but for a fortunate accident which happened to me when I was\n      a very little boy. A good-hearted old Irish nurse (whom I shall\n      not forget in my will) took me up one day by the heels, when I\n      was making more noise than was necessary, and swinging me round\n      two or three times, d—d my eyes for “a skreeking little\r\nspalpeen,” and then knocked my head into a cocked hat against the\n      bedpost. This, I say, decided my fate, and made my fortune. A\n      bump arose at once on my sinciput, and turned out to be as pretty\n      an organ of order as one shall see on a summer’s day. Hence that\n      positive appetite for system and regularity which has made me the\n      distinguished man of business that I am.\n\n      If there is any thing on earth I hate, it is a genius. Your\n      geniuses are all arrant asses—the greater the genius the greater\n      the ass—and to this rule there is no exception whatever.\r\nEspecially, you cannot make a man of business out of a genius,\n      any more than money out of a Jew, or the best nutmegs out of\n      pine-knots. The creatures are always going off at a tangent into\n      some fantastic employment, or ridiculous speculation, entirely at\n      variance with the “fitness of things,” and having no business\n      whatever to be considered as a business at all. Thus you may tell\n      these characters immediately by the nature of their occupations.\n      If you ever perceive a man setting up as a merchant or a","manufacturer, or going into the cotton or tobacco trade, or any\n      of those eccentric pursuits; or getting to be a drygoods dealer,\n      or soap-boiler, or something of that kind; or pretending to be a\n      lawyer, or a blacksmith, or a physician—any thing out of the\n      usual way—you may set him down at once as a genius, and then,\n      according to the rule-of-three, he’s an ass.\n\n      Now I am not in any respect a genius, but a regular business man.\n      My day-book and ledger will evince this in a minute. They are\n      well kept, though I say it myself; and, in my general habits of\r\naccuracy and punctuality, I am not to be beat by a clock.\n      Moreover, my occupations have been always made to chime in with\n      the ordinary habitudes of my fellowmen. Not that I feel the least\n      indebted, upon this score, to my exceedingly weak-minded parents,\n      who, beyond doubt, would have made an arrant genius of me at\n      last, if my guardian angel had not come, in good time, to the\n      rescue. In biography the truth is every thing, and in\n      autobiography it is especially so—yet I scarcely hope to be\r\nbelieved when I state, however solemnly, that my poor father put\n      me, when I was about fifteen years of age, into the\n      counting-house of what be termed “a respectable hardware and\n      commission merchant doing a capital bit of business!” A capital\n      bit of fiddlestick! However, the consequence of this folly was,\n      that in two or three days, I had to be sent home to my\n      button-headed family in a high state of fever, and with a most\n      violent and dangerous pain in the sinciput, all around about my\n      organ of order. It was nearly a gone case with me then—just\r\ntouch-and-go for six weeks—the physicians giving me up and all\n      that sort of thing. But, although I suffered much, I was a\n      thankful boy in the main. I was saved from being a “respectable\n      hardware and commission merchant, doing a capital bit of\n      business,” and I felt grateful to the protuberance which had been\n      the means of my salvation, as well as to the kindhearted female\n      who had originally put these means within my reach.\n\n      The most of boys run away from home at ten or twelve years of","age, but I waited till I was sixteen. I don’t know that I should\n      have gone even then, if I had not happened to hear my old mother\n      talk about setting me up on my own hook in the grocery way. The\n      grocery way!—only think of that! I resolved to be off forthwith,\n      and try and establish myself in some decent occupation, without\n      dancing attendance any longer upon the caprices of these\n      eccentric old people, and running the risk of being made a genius\n      of in the end. In this project I succeeded perfectly well at the\r\nfirst effort, and by the time I was fairly eighteen, found myself\n      doing an extensive and profitable business in the Tailor’s\n      Walking-Advertisement line.\n\n      I was enabled to discharge the onerous duties of this profession,\n      only by that rigid adherence to system which formed the leading\n      feature of my mind. A scrupulous method characterized my actions\n      as well as my accounts. In my case it was method—not money—which\n      made the man: at least all of him that was not made by the tailor\n      whom I served. At nine, every morning, I called upon that\r\nindividual for the clothes of the day. Ten o’clock found me in\n      some fashionable promenade or other place of public amusement.\n      The precise regularity with which I turned my handsome person\n      about, so as to bring successively into view every portion of the\n      suit upon my back, was the admiration of all the knowing men in\n      the trade. Noon never passed without my bringing home a customer\n      to the house of my employers, Messrs. Cut & Comeagain. I say this\n      proudly, but with tears in my eyes—for the firm proved themselves\r\nthe basest of ingrates. The little account, about which we\n      quarreled and finally parted, cannot, in any item, be thought\n      overcharged, by gentlemen really conversant with the nature of\n      the business. Upon this point, however, I feel a degree of proud\n      satisfaction in permitting the reader to judge for himself. My\n      bill ran thus:\n\n_Messrs.

Upon my word of honor, this\n      was not an unreasonable price for that dickey. It was one of the\n      cleanest and prettiest little dickeys I ever saw; and I have good\n      reason to believe that it effected the sale of three Petershams.\n      The elder partner of the firm, however, would allow me only one\n      penny of the charge, and took it upon himself to show in what\n      manner four of the same sized conveniences could be got out of a\r\nsheet of foolscap. But it is needless to say that I stood upon\n      the principle of the thing. Business is business, and should be\n      done in a business way. There was no system whatever in swindling\n      me out of a penny—a clear fraud of fifty per cent—no method in\n      any respect. I left at once the employment of Messrs. Cut &\n      Comeagain, and set up in the Eye-Sore line by myself—one of the\n      most lucrative, respectable, and independent of the ordinary\n      occupations.\n\n      My strict integrity, economy, and rigorous business habits, here","again came into play. I found myself driving a flourishing trade,\n      and soon became a marked man upon “Change.” The truth is, I never\n      dabbled in flashy matters, but jogged on in the good old sober\n      routine of the calling—a calling in which I should, no doubt,\n      have remained to the present hour, but for a little accident\n      which happened to me in the prosecution of one of the usual\n      business operations of the profession. Whenever a rich old hunks\n      or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets into the notion of\r\nputting up a palace, there is no such thing in the world as\n      stopping either of them, and this every intelligent person knows.\n      The fact in question is indeed the basis of the Eye-Sore trade.\n      As soon, therefore, as a building-project is fairly afoot by one\n      of these parties, we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in\n      contemplation, or a prime little situation just adjoining, or\n      tight in front. This done, we wait until the palace is half-way\n      up, and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an\r\nornamental mud hovel, right against it; or a Down-East or Dutch\n      Pagoda, or a pig-sty, or an ingenious little bit of fancy work,\n      either Esquimau, Kickapoo, or Hottentot. Of course we can’t\n      afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five\n      hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster. Can\n      we? I ask the question. I ask it of business men. It would be\n      irrational to suppose that we can. And yet there was a rascally\n      corporation which asked me to do this very thing—this very thing!\r\nI did not reply to their absurd proposition, of course; but I\n      felt it a duty to go that same night, and lamp-black the whole of\n      their palace. For this the unreasonable villains clapped me into\n      jail; and the gentlemen of the Eye-Sore trade could not well\n      avoid cutting my connection when I came out.\n\n      The Assault-and-Battery business, into which I was now forced to\n      adventure for a livelihood, was somewhat ill-adapted to the\n      delicate nature of my constitution; but I went to work in it with","a good heart, and found my account here, as heretofore, in those\n      stern habits of methodical accuracy which had been thumped into\n      me by that delightful old nurse—I would indeed be the basest of\n      men not to remember her well in my will. By observing, as I say,\n      the strictest system in all my dealings, and keeping a\n      well-regulated set of books, I was enabled to get over many\n      serious difficulties, and, in the end, to establish myself very\n      decently in the profession. The truth is, that few individuals,\r\nin any line, did a snugger little business than I. I will just\n      copy a page or so out of my Day-Book; and this will save me the\n      necessity of blowing my own trumpet—a contemptible practice of\n      which no high-minded man will be guilty. Now, the Day-Book is a\n      thing that don’t lie.\n\n      “Jan. 1.—New Year’s Day. Met Snap in the street, groggy.\n      Mem—he’ll do. Met Gruff shortly afterward, blind drunk. Mem—he’ll\n      answer, too. Entered both gentlemen in my Ledger, and opened a\n      running account with each.\r\n“Jan. 2.—Saw Snap at the Exchange, and went up and trod on his\n      toe. Doubled his fist and knocked me down. Good!—got up again.\n      Some trifling difficulty with Bag, my attorney. I want the\n      damages at a thousand, but he says that for so simple a knock\n      down we can’t lay them at more than five hundred. Mem—must get\n      rid of Bag—no system at all.\n\n      “Jan. 3.—Went to the theatre, to look for Gruff. Saw him sitting\n      in a side box, in the second tier, between a fat lady and a lean\n      one. Quizzed the whole party through an opera-glass, till I saw\r\nthe fat lady blush and whisper to G. Went round, then, into the\n      box, and put my nose within reach of his hand. Wouldn’t pull\n      it—no go. Blew it, and tried again—no go. Sat down then, and\n      winked at the lean lady, when I had the high satisfaction of\n      finding him lift me up by the nape of the neck, and fling me over\n      into the pit. Neck dislocated, and right leg capitally\n      splintered. Went home in high glee, drank a bottle of champagne,\n      and booked the young man for five thousand. Bag says it’ll do.","“Feb. 15.—Compromised the case of Mr. Snap. Amount entered in\n      Journal—fifty cents—which see.\n\n      “Feb. 16.—Cast by that ruffian, Gruff, who made me a present of\n      five dollars. Costs of suit, four dollars and twenty-five cents.\n      Nett profit,—see Journal,—seventy-five cents.”\n\n      Now, here is a clear gain, in a very brief period, of no less\n      than one dollar and twenty-five cents—this is in the mere cases\n      of Snap and Gruff; and I solemnly assure the reader that these\n      extracts are taken at random from my Day-Book.\r\nIt’s an old saying, and a true one, however, that money is\n      nothing in comparison with health. I found the exactions of the\n      profession somewhat too much for my delicate state of body; and,\n      discovering, at last, that I was knocked all out of shape, so\n      that I didn’t know very well what to make of the matter, and so\n      that my friends, when they met me in the street, couldn’t tell\n      that I was Peter Proffit at all, it occurred to me that the best\n      expedient I could adopt was to alter my line of business. I\r\nturned my attention, therefore, to Mud-Dabbling, and continued it\n      for some years.\n\n      The worst of this occupation is, that too many people take a\n      fancy to it, and the competition is in consequence excessive.\n      Every ignoramus of a fellow who finds that he hasn’t brains in\n      sufficient quantity to make his way as a walking advertiser, or\n      an eye-sore prig, or a salt-and-batter man, thinks, of course,\n      that he’ll answer very well as a dabbler of mud. But there never\n      was entertained a more erroneous idea than that it requires no\r\nbrains to mud-dabble. Especially, there is nothing to be made in\n      this way without method. I did only a retail business myself, but\n      my old habits of system carried me swimmingly along. I selected\n      my street-crossing, in the first place, with great deliberation,\n      and I never put down a broom in any part of the town but that. I\n      took care, too, to have a nice little puddle at hand, which I\n      could get at in a minute. By these means I got to be well known\n      as a man to be trusted; and this is one-half the battle, let me","tell you, in trade. Nobody ever failed to pitch me a copper, and\n      got over my crossing with a clean pair of pantaloons. And, as my\n      business habits, in this respect, were sufficiently understood, I\n      never met with any attempt at imposition. I wouldn’t have put up\n      with it, if I had. Never imposing upon any one myself, I suffered\n      no one to play the possum with me. The frauds of the banks of\n      course I couldn’t help. Their suspension put me to ruinous\n      inconvenience. These, however, are not individuals, but\r\ncorporations; and corporations, it is very well known, have\n      neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be damned.\n\n      I was making money at this business when, in an evil moment, I\n      was induced to merge it in the Cur-Spattering—a somewhat\n      analogous, but, by no means, so respectable a profession. My\n      location, to be sure, was an excellent one, being central, and I\n      had capital blacking and brushes. My little dog, too, was quite\n      fat and up to all varieties of snuff. He had been in the trade a\r\nlong time, and, I may say, understood it. Our general routine was\n      this:—Pompey, having rolled himself well in the mud, sat upon end\n      at the shop door, until he observed a dandy approaching in bright\n      boots. He then proceeded to meet him, and gave the Wellingtons a\n      rub or two with his wool. Then the dandy swore very much, and\n      looked about for a boot-black. There I was, full in his view,\n      with blacking and brushes. It was only a minute’s work, and then\n      came a sixpence. This did moderately well for a time;—in fact, I\r\nwas not avaricious, but my dog was. I allowed him a third of the\n      profit, but he was advised to insist upon half. This I couldn’t\n      stand—so we quarrelled and parted.\n\n      I next tried my hand at the Organ-Grinding for a while, and may\n      say that I made out pretty well. It is a plain, straightforward\n      business, and requires no particular abilities. You can get a\n      music-mill for a mere song, and to put it in order, you have but\n      to open the works, and give them three or four smart raps with a","hammer. It improves the tone of the thing, for business purposes,\n      more than you can imagine. This done, you have only to stroll\n      along, with the mill on your back, until you see tanbark in the\n      street, and a knocker wrapped up in buckskin. Then you stop and\n      grind; looking as if you meant to stop and grind till doomsday.\n      Presently a window opens, and somebody pitches you a sixpence,\n      with a request to “Hush up and go on,” etc. I am aware that some\n      grinders have actually afforded to “go on” for this sum; but for\r\nmy part, I found the necessary outlay of capital too great to\n      permit of my “going on” under a shilling.\n\n      At this occupation I did a good deal; but, somehow, I was not\n      quite satisfied, and so finally abandoned it. The truth is, I\n      labored under the disadvantage of having no monkey—and American\n      streets are so muddy, and a Democratic rabble is so obstrusive,\n      and so full of demnition mischievous little boys.\n\n      I was now out of employment for some months, but at length\n      succeeded, by dint of great interest, in procuring a situation in\r\nthe Sham-Post. The duties, here, are simple, and not altogether\n      unprofitable. For example:—very early in the morning I had to\n      make up my packet of sham letters. Upon the inside of each of\n      these I had to scrawl a few lines on any subject which occurred\n      to me as sufficiently mysterious—signing all the epistles Tom\n      Dobson, or Bobby Tompkins, or anything in that way. Having folded\n      and sealed all, and stamped them with sham postmarks—New Orleans,\n      Bengal, Botany Bay, or any other place a great way off—I set out,\r\nforthwith, upon my daily route, as if in a very great hurry. I\n      always called at the big houses to deliver the letters, and\n      receive the postage. Nobody hesitates at paying for a\n      letter—especially for a double one—people are such fools—and it\n      was no trouble to get round a corner before there was time to\n      open the epistles. The worst of this profession was, that I had\n      to walk so much and so fast; and so frequently to vary my route.\n      Besides, I had serious scruples of conscience. I can’t bear to","hear innocent individuals abused—and the way the whole town took\n      to cursing Tom Dobson and Bobby Tompkins was really awful to\n      hear. I washed my hands of the matter in disgust.\n\n      My eighth and last speculation has been in the Cat-Growing way. I\n      have found that a most pleasant and lucrative business, and,\n      really, no trouble at all. The country, it is well known, has\n      become infested with cats—so much so of late, that a petition for\n      relief, most numerously and respectably signed, was brought\r\nbefore the Legislature at its late memorable session. The\n      Assembly, at this epoch, was unusually well-informed, and, having\n      passed many other wise and wholesome enactments, it crowned all\n      with the Cat-Act. In its original form, this law offered a\n      premium for cat-heads (fourpence a-piece), but the Senate\n      succeeded in amending the main clause, so as to substitute the\n      word “tails” for “heads.” This amendment was so obviously proper,\n      that the House concurred in it nem. con.\n\n      As soon as the governor had signed the bill, I invested my whole\r\nestate in the purchase of Toms and Tabbies. At first I could only\n      afford to feed them upon mice (which are cheap), but they\n      fulfilled the scriptural injunction at so marvellous a rate, that\n      I at length considered it my best policy to be liberal, and so\n      indulged them in oysters and turtle. Their tails, at a\n      legislative price, now bring me in a good income; for I have\n      discovered a way, in which, by means of Macassar oil, I can force\n      three crops in a year. It delights me to find, too, that the\r\nanimals soon get accustomed to the thing, and would rather have\n      the appendages cut off than otherwise. I consider myself,\n      therefore, a made man, and am bargaining for a country-seat on\n      the Hudson.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LANDSCAPE GARDEN\n\n\n     The garden like a lady fair was cut\n         That lay as if she slumbered in delight,\n     And to the open skies her eyes did shut;\n         The azure fields of heaven were ’sembled right\n         In a large round set with flow’rs of light:\n     The flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew","That hung upon their azure leaves, did show\n     Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the ev’ning blue.\n                    —GILES FLETCHER\n\n      No more remarkable man ever lived than my friend, the young\n      Ellison. He was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion\n      of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune. From his cradle\n      to his grave, a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along.\n      Nor do I use the word Prosperity in its mere wordly or external\n      sense. I mean it as synonymous with happiness. The person of whom\r\nI speak, seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild\n      doctrines of Turgot, Price, Priestley, and Condorcet—of\n      exemplifying, by individual instance, what has been deemed the\n      mere chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief existence of\n      Ellison, I fancy, that I have seen refuted the dogma—that in\n      man’s physical and spiritual nature, lies some hidden principle,\n      the antagonist of Bliss. An intimate and anxious examination of\n      his career, has taught me to understand that, in general, from\r\nthe violation of a few simple laws of Humanity, arises the\n      Wretchedness of mankind; that, as a species, we have in our\n      possession the as yet unwrought elements of Content,—and that\n      even now, in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on\n      the great question of the Social Condition, it is not impossible\n      that Man, the individual, under certain unusual and highly\n      fortuitous conditions, may be happy.\n\n      With opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued; and\n      thus is it especially worthy of observation that the\r\nuninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great\n      part the result of preconcert. It is, indeed evident, that with\n      less of the instinctive philosophy which, now and then, stands so\n      well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison would have found\n      himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary successes of his\n      life, into the common vortex of Unhappiness which yawns for those\n      of preeminent endowments. But it is by no means my present object\n      to pen an essay on Happiness. The ideas of my friend may be","summed up in a few words. He admitted but four unvarying laws, or\n      rather elementary principles, of Bliss. That which he considered\n      chief, was (strange to say!) the simple and purely physical one\n      of free exercise in the open air. “The health,” he said,\n      “attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name.”\n      He pointed to the tillers of the earth—the only people who, as a\n      class, are proverbially more happy than others—and then he\n      instanced the high ecstasies of the fox-hunter. His second\r\nprinciple was the love of woman. His third was the contempt of\n      ambition. His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he\n      held that, other things being equal, the extent of happiness was\n      proportioned to the spirituality of this object.\n\n      I have said that Ellison was remarkable in the continuous\n      profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by Fortune. In personal\n      grace and beauty he exceeded all men. His intellect was of that\n      order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a\n      necessity and an intuition. His family was one of the most\r\nillustrious of the empire. His bride was the loveliest and most\n      devoted of women. His possessions had been always ample; but,\n      upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year, it was\n      discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of Fate had\n      been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world\n      amid which they occur, and seldom fail radically to alter the\n      entire moral constitution of those who are their objects. It\n      appears that about one hundred years prior to Mr. Ellison’s\r\nattainment of his majority, there had died, in a remote province,\n      one Mr. Seabright Ellison. This gentlemen had amassed a princely\n      fortune, and, having no very immediate connexions, conceived the\n      whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after\n      his decease. Minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes\n      of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest\n      of blood, bearing the name Ellison, who should be alive at the\n      end of the hundred years. Many futile attempts had been made to","set aside this singular bequest; their ex post facto character\n      rendered them abortive; but the attention of a jealous government\n      was aroused, and a decree finally obtained, forbidding all\n      similar accumulations. This act did not prevent young Ellison,\n      upon his twenty-first birth-day, from entering into possession,\n      as the heir of his ancestor, Seabright, of a fortune of four\n      hundred and fifty millions of dollars. {*1}\n\n      When it had become definitely known that such was the enormous\n      wealth inherited, there were, of course, many speculations as to\r\nthe mode of its disposal. The gigantic magnitude and the\n      immediately available nature of the sum, dazzled and bewildered\n      all who thought upon the topic. The possessor of any appreciable\n      amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a\n      thousand things. With riches merely surpassing those of any\n      citizen, it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to\n      supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time; or\n      busying himself with political intrigues; or aiming at\r\nministerial power; or purchasing increase of nobility, or\n      devising gorgeous architectural piles; or collecting large\n      specimens of Virtu; or playing the munificent patron of Letters\n      and Art; or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive\n      institutions of charity. But, for the inconceivable wealth in the\n      actual possession of the young heir, these objects and all\n      ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate. Recourse was had to\n      figures; and figures but sufficed to confound. It was seen, that\r\neven at three per cent, the annual income of the inheritance\n      amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred\n      thousand dollars; which was one million and one hundred and\n      twenty-five thousand per month; or thirty-six thousand, nine\n      hundred and eighty-six per day, or one thousand five hundred and\n      forty-one per hour, or six and twenty dollars for every minute\n      that flew. Thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly\n      broken up. Men knew not what to imagine. There were some who even","conceived that Mr. Ellison would divest himself forthwith of at\n      least two-thirds of his fortune as of utterly superfluous\n      opulence; enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of\n      his superabundance.\n\n      I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made\n      up his mind upon a topic which had occasioned so much of\n      discussion to his friends. Nor was I greatly astonished at the\n      nature of his decision. In the widest and noblest sense, he was a\n      poet. He comprehended, moreover, the true character, the august\r\naims, the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment.\n      The proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt\n      to lie in the creation of novel forms of Beauty. Some\n      peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the nature of\n      his intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism the\n      whole cast of his ethical speculations; and it was this bias,\n      perhaps, which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most\n      advantageous, if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise\r\nof the poetic sentiment, was to be found in the creation of novel\n      moods of purely physical loveliness. Thus it happened that he\n      became neither musician nor poet; if we use this latter term in\n      its every-day acceptation. Or it might have been that he became\n      neither the one nor the other, in pursuance of an idea of his\n      which I have already mentioned—the idea, that in the contempt of\n      ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on\n      earth. Is it not, indeed, possible that while a high order of\r\ngenius is necessarily ambitious, the highest is invariably above\n      that which is termed ambition? And may it not thus happen that\n      many far greater than Milton, have contentedly remained “mute and\n      inglorious?” I believe the world has never yet seen, and that,\n      unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order\n      of mind into distasteful exertion, the world will never behold,\n      that full extent of triumphant execution, in the richer\n      productions of Art, of which the human nature is absolutely\n      capable.","Mr. Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man\n      lived more profoundly enamored both of Music and the Muse. Under\n      other circumstances than those which invested him, it is not\n      impossible that he would have become a painter. The field of\n      sculpture, although in its nature rigidly poetical, was too\n      limited in its extent and in its consequences, to have occupied,\n      at any time, much of his attention. And I have now mentioned all\n      the provinces in which even the most liberal understanding of the\n      poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of\r\nexpatiating. I mean the most liberal public or recognized\n      conception of the idea involved in the phrase “poetic sentiment.”\n      But Mr. Ellison imagined that the richest, and altogether the\n      most natural and most suitable province, had been blindly\n      neglected. No definition had spoken of the Landscape-Gardener, as\n      of the poet; yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the\n      creation of the Landscape-Garden offered to the true muse the\n      most magnificent of opportunities. Here was, indeed, the fairest\r\nfield for the display of invention, or imagination, in the\n      endless combining of forms of novel Beauty; the elements which\n      should enter into combination being, at all times, and by a vast\n      superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. In\n      the multiform of the tree, and in the multicolor of the flower,\n      he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of\n      Nature at physical loveliness. And in the direction or\n      concentration of this effort, or, still more properly, in its\r\nadaption to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth, he\n      perceived that he should be employing the best means—laboring to\n      the greatest advantage—in the fulfilment of his destiny as Poet.\n\n      “Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth.”\n      In his explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much\n      towards solving what has always seemed to me an enigma. I mean\n      the fact (which none but the ignorant dispute) that no such\n      combinations of scenery exist in Nature as the painter of genius","has in his power to produce. No such Paradises are to be found in\n      reality as have glowed upon the canvass of Claude. In the most\n      enchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a\n      defect or an excess—many excesses and defects. While the\n      component parts may exceed, individually, the highest skill of\n      the artist, the arrangement of the parts will always be\n      susceptible of improvement. In short, no position can be\n      attained, from which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will\n      not find matter of offence, in what is technically termed the\r\ncomposition of a natural landscape. And yet how unintelligible is\n      this! In all other matters we are justly instructed to regard\n      Nature as supreme. With her details we shrink from competition.\n      Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or to\n      improve the proportions of the lily of the valley? The criticism\n      which says, of sculpture or of portraiture, that “Nature is to be\n      exalted rather than imitated,” is in error. No pictorial or\n      sculptural combinations of points of human loveliness, do more\r\nthan approach the living and breathing human beauty as it\n      gladdens our daily path. Byron, who often erred, erred not in\n      saying, I’ve seen more living beauty, ripe and real, than all the\n      nonsense of their stone ideal. In landscape alone is the\n      principle of the critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it\n      is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced\n      him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of Art.\n      Having, I say, felt its truth here. For the feeling is no\r\naffectation or chimera. The mathematics afford no more absolute\n      demonstrations, than the sentiment of his Art yields to the\n      artist. He not only believes, but positively knows, that such and\n      such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter, or form,\n      constitute, and alone constitute, the true Beauty. Yet his\n      reasons have not yet been matured into expression. It remains for\n      a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen, fully to\n      investigate and express them. Nevertheless is he confirmed in his","instinctive opinions, by the concurrence of all his compeers. Let\n      a composition be defective; let an emendation be wrought in its\n      mere arrangement of form; let this emendation be submitted to\n      every artist in the world; by each will its necessity be\n      admitted. And even far more than this, in remedy of the defective\n      composition, each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest\n      the identical emendation.\n\n      I repeat that in landscape arrangements, or collocations alone,\r\nis the physical Nature susceptible of “exaltation” and that,\n      therefore, her susceptibility of improvement at this one point,\n      was a mystery which, hitherto I had been unable to solve. It was\n      Mr. Ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as\n      improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty, was really such,\n      as respected only the mortal or human point of view; that each\n      alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly\n      effect a blemish in the picture, if we could suppose this picture\r\nviewed at large from some remote point in the heavens. “It is\n      easily understood,” says Mr. Ellison, “that what might improve a\n      closely scrutinized detail, might, at the same time, injure a\n      general and more distantly observed effect.” He spoke upon this\n      topic with warmth: regarding not so much its immediate or obvious\n      importance (which is little), as the character of the conclusions\n      to which it might lead, or of the collateral propositions which\n      it might serve to corroborate or sustain. There might be a class\r\nof beings, human once, but now to humanity invisible, for whose\n      scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful,\n      more especially than for our own, had been set in order by God\n      the great landscape-garden of the whole earth.\n\n      In the course of our discussion, my young friend took occasion to\n      quote some passages from a writer who has been supposed to have\n      well treated this theme.\n\n      “There are, properly,” he writes, “but two styles of\n      landscape-gardening, the natural and the artificial. One seeks to","recall the original beauty of the country, by adapting its means\n      to the surrounding scenery; cultivating trees in harmony with the\n      hills or plain of the neighboring land; detecting and bringing\n      into practice those nice relations of size, proportion and color\n      which, hid from the common observer, are revealed everywhere to\n      the experienced student of nature. The result of the natural\n      style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all defects\n      and incongruities—in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and\r\norder, than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles.\n      The artificial style has as many varieties as there are different\n      tastes to gratify. It has a certain general relation to the\n      various styles of building. There are the stately avenues and\n      retirements of Versailles; Italian terraces; and a various mixed\n      old English style, which bears some relation to the domestic\n      Gothic or English Elizabethan architecture. Whatever may be said\n      against the abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a\r\nmixture of pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty.\n      This is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of order and\n      design, and partly moral. A terrace, with an old moss-covered\n      balustrade, calls up at once to the eye, the fair forms that have\n      passed there in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is an\n      evidence of care and human interest.”\n\n      “From what I have already observed,” said Mr. Ellison, “you will\n      understand that I reject the idea, here expressed, of ‘recalling\n      the original beauty of the country.’ The original beauty is never\r\nso great as that which may be introduced. Of course, much depends\n      upon the selection of a spot with capabilities. What is said in\n      respect to the ‘detecting and bringing into practice those nice\n      relations of size, proportion and color,’ is a mere vagueness of\n      speech, which may mean much, or little, or nothing, and which\n      guides in no degree. That the true ‘result of the natural style\n      of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and\n      incongruities, than in the creation of any special wonders or","miracles,’ is a proposition better suited to the grovelling\n      apprehension of the herd, than to the fervid dreams of the man of\n      genius. The merit suggested is, at best, negative, and appertains\n      to that hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate\n      Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while that merit which\n      consists in the mere avoiding demerit, appeals directly to the\n      understanding, and can thus be foreshadowed in Rule, the loftier\n      merit, which breathes and flames in invention or creation, can be\r\napprehended solely in its results. Rule applies but to the\n      excellences of avoidance—to the virtues which deny or refrain.\n      Beyond these the critical art can but suggest. We may be\n      instructed to build an Odyssey, but it is in vain that we are\n      told how to conceive a ‘Tempest,’ an ‘Inferno,’ a ‘Prometheus\n      Bound,’ a ‘Nightingale,’ such as that of Keats, or the ‘Sensitive\n      Plant’ of Shelley. But, the thing done, the wonder accomplished,\n      and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. The sophists\r\nof the negative school, who, through inability to create, have\n      scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. What,\n      in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure\n      reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort\n      admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the\n      sublime.\n\n      “Our author’s observations on the artificial style of gardening,”\n      continued Mr. Ellison, “are less objectionable. ‘A mixture of\n      pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty.’ This is\r\njust, and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally\n      so. I repeat that the principle here expressed, is\n      incontrovertible; but there may be something even beyond it.\n      There may be an object in full keeping with the principle\n      suggested—an object unattainable by the means ordinarily in\n      possession of mankind, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm\n      to the landscape-garden immeasurably surpassing that which a\n      merely human interest could bestow. The true poet possessed of","very unusual pecuniary resources, might possibly, while retaining\n      the necessary idea of art or interest or culture, so imbue his\n      designs at once with extent and novelty of Beauty, as to convey\n      the sentiment of spiritual interference. It will be seen that, in\n      bringing about such result, he secures all the advantages of\n      interest or design, while relieving his work of all the harshness\n      and technicality of Art. In the most rugged of wildernesses—in\n      the most savage of the scenes of pure Nature—there is apparent\r\nthe art of a Creator; yet is this art apparent only to\n      reflection; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling.\n      Now, if we imagine this sense of the Almighty Design to be\n      harmonized in a measurable degree, if we suppose a landscape\n      whose combined strangeness, vastness, definitiveness, and\n      magnificence, shall inspire the idea of culture, or care, or\n      superintendence, on the part of intelligences superior yet akin\n      to humanity—then the sentiment of interest is preserved, while\r\nthe Art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary\n      Nature—a Nature which is not God, nor an emanation of God, but\n      which still is Nature, in the sense that it is the handiwork of\n      the angels that hover between man and God.”\n\n      It was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical\n      embodiment of a vision such as this—in the free exercise in the\n      open air, which resulted from personal direction of his plans—in\n      the continuous and unceasing object which these plans afforded—in\r\nthe high spirituality of the object itself—in the contempt of\n      ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affect—and,\n      lastly, it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted\n      wife, that Ellison thought to find, and found, an exemption from\n      the ordinary cares of Humanity, with a far greater amount of\n      positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De\n      Staël.\n\n\n\n\nMAELZEL’S CHESS-PLAYER\n\n\n      Perhaps no exhibition of the kind has ever elicited so general\n      attention as the Chess-Player of Maelzel. Wherever seen it has","been an object of intense curiosity, to all persons who think.\n      Yet the question of its _modus operandi_ is still undetermined.\n      Nothing has been written on this topic which can be considered as\n      decisive—and accordingly we find every where men of mechanical\n      genius, of great general acuteness, and discriminative\n      understanding, who make no scruple in pronouncing the Automaton a\n      _pure machine_, unconnected with human agency in its movements,\n      and consequently, beyond all comparison, the most astonishing of\r\nthe inventions of mankind. And such it would undoubtedly be, were\n      they right in their supposition. Assuming this hypothesis, it\n      would be grossly absurd to compare with the Chess-Player, any\n      similar thing of either modern or ancient days. Yet there have\n      been many and wonderful automata. In Brewster’s Letters on\n      Natural Magic, we have an account of the most remarkable. Among\n      these may be mentioned, as having beyond doubt existed, firstly,\n      the coach invented by M. Camus for the amusement of Louis XIV\r\nwhen a child. A table, about four feet square, was introduced,\n      into the room appropriated for the exhibition. Upon this table\n      was placed a carriage, six inches in length, made of wood, and\n      drawn by two horses of the same material. One window being down,\n      a lady was seen on the back seat. A coachman held the reins on\n      the box, and a footman and page were in their places behind. M.\n      Camus now touched a spring; whereupon the coachman smacked his\n      whip, and the horses proceeded in a natural manner, along the\r\nedge of the table, drawing after them the carriage. Having gone\n      as far as possible in this direction, a sudden turn was made to\n      the left, and the vehicle was driven at right angles to its\n      former course, and still closely along the edge of the table. In\n      this way the coach proceeded until it arrived opposite the chair\n      of the young prince. It then stopped, the page descended and\n      opened the door, the lady alighted, and presented a petition to\n      her sovereign. She then re-entered. The page put up the steps,","closed the door, and resumed his station. The coachman whipped\n      his horses, and the carriage was driven back to its original\n      position.\n\n      The magician of M. Maillardet is also worthy of notice. We copy\n      the following account of it from the _Letters_ before mentioned\n      of Dr. B., who derived his information principally from the\n      Edinburgh Encyclopaedia.\n\n      “One of the most popular pieces of mechanism which we have seen,\n      Is the Magician constructed by M. Maillardet, for the purpose of\n      answering certain given questions. A figure, dressed like a\r\nmagician, appears seated at the bottom of a wall, holding a wand\n      in one hand, and a book in the other A number of questions, ready\n      prepared, are inscribed on oval medallions, and the spectator\n      takes any of these he chooses and to which he wishes an answer,\n      and having placed it in a drawer ready to receive it, the drawer\n      shuts with a spring till the answer is returned. The magician\n      then arises from his seat, bows his head, describes circles with\n      his wand, and consulting the book as If in deep thought, he lifts\r\nit towards his face. Having thus appeared to ponder over the\n      proposed question he raises his wand, and striking with it the\n      wall above his head, two folding doors fly open, and display an\n      appropriate answer to the question. The doors again close, the\n      magician resumes his original position, and the drawer opens to\n      return the medallion. There are twenty of these medallions, all\n      containing different questions, to which the magician returns the\n      most suitable and striking answers. The medallions are thin\r\nplates of brass, of an elliptical form, exactly resembling each\n      other. Some of the medallions have a question inscribed on each\n      side, both of which the magician answered in succession. If the\n      drawer is shut without a medallion being put into it, the\n      magician rises, consults his book, shakes his head, and resumes\n      his seat. The folding doors remain shut, and the drawer is\n      returned empty. If two medallions are put into the drawer\n      together, an answer is returned only to the lower one. When the","machinery is wound up, the movements continue about an hour,\n      during which time about fifty questions may be answered. The\n      inventor stated that the means by which the different medallions\n      acted upon the machinery, so as to produce the proper answers to\n      the questions which they contained, were extremely simple.”\n\n      The duck of Vaucanson was still more remarkable. It was _of _the\n      size of life, and so perfect an imitation of the living animal\n      that all the spectators were deceived. It executed, says\n      Brewster, all the natural movements and gestures, it ate and\r\ndrank with avidity, performed all the quick motions of the head\n      and throat which are peculiar to the duck, and like it muddled\n      the water which it drank with its bill. It produced also the\n      sound of quacking in the most natural manner. In the anatomical\n      structure the artist exhibited the highest skill. Every bone in\n      the real duck had its representative In the automaton, and its\n      wings were anatomically exact. Every cavity, apophysis, and\n      curvature was imitated, and each bone executed its proper\r\nmovements. When corn was thrown down before it, the duck\n      stretched out its neck to pick it up, swallowed, and digested it.\n      {*1}\n\n      But if these machines were ingenious, what shall we think of the\n      calculating machine of Mr. Babbage? What shall we think of an\n      engine of wood and metal which can not only compute astronomical\n      and navigation tables to any given extent, but render the\n      exactitude of its operations mathematically certain through its\n      power of correcting its possible errors? What shall we think of a\r\nmachine which can not only accomplish all this, but actually\n      print off its elaborate results, when obtained, without the\n      slightest intervention of the intellect of man? It will, perhaps,\n      be said, in reply, that a machine such as we have described is\n      altogether above comparison with the Chess-Player of Maelzel. By\n      no means—it is altogether beneath it—that is to say provided we\n      assume (what should never for a moment be assumed) that the\n      Chess-Player is a _pure machine, _and performs its operations","without any immediate human agency. Arithmetical or algebraical\n      calculations are, from their very nature, fixed and determinate.\n      Certain _data _being given, certain results necessarily and\n      inevitably follow. These results have dependence upon nothing,\n      and are influenced by nothing but the _data _originally given.\n      And the question to be solved proceeds, or should proceed, to its\n      final determination, by a succession of unerring steps liable to\n      no change, and subject to no modification. This being the case,\r\nwe can without difficulty conceive the _possibility _of so\n      arranging a piece of mechanism, that upon starting In accordance\n      with the _data _of the question to be solved, it should continue\n      its movements regularly, progressively, and undeviatingly towards\n      the required solution, since these movements, however complex,\n      are never imagined to be otherwise than finite and determinate.\n      But the case is widely different with the Chess-Player. With him\n      there is no determinate progression. No one move in chess\r\nnecessarily follows upon any one other. From no particular\n      disposition of the men at one period of a game can we predicate\n      their disposition at a different period. Let us place the _first\n      move _in a game of chess, in juxta-position with the _data _of an\n      algebraical question, and their great difference will be\n      immediately perceived. From the latter—from the _data—_the second\n      step of the question, dependent thereupon, inevitably follows. It\n      is modelled by the _data. _It must be _thus _and not otherwise.\r\nBut from the first move in the game of chess no especial second\n      move follows of necessity. In the algebraical question, as it\n      proceeds towards solution, the _certainty _of its operations\n      remains altogether unimpaired. The second step having been a\n      consequence of the _data, _the third step is equally a\n      consequence of the second, the fourth of the third, the fifth of\n      the fourth, and so on, _and not possibly otherwise, _to the end.\n      But in proportion to the progress made in a game of chess, is the","_uncertainty _of each ensuing move. A few moves having been made,\n      _no _step is certain. Different spectators of the game would\n      advise different moves. All is then dependent upon the variable\n      judgment of the players. Now even granting (what should not be\n      granted) that the movements of the Automaton Chess-Player were in\n      themselves determinate, they would be necessarily interrupted and\n      disarranged by the indeterminate will of his antagonist. There is\n      then no analogy whatever between the operations of the\r\nChess-Player, and those of the calculating machine of Mr.\n      Babbage, and if we choose to call the former a _pure machine _we\n      must be prepared to admit that it is, beyond all comparison, the\n      most wonderful of the inventions of mankind. Its original\n      projector, however, Baron Kempelen, had no scruple in declaring\n      it to be a “very ordinary piece of mechanism—a _bagatelle _whose\n      effects appeared so marvellous only from the boldness of the\n      conception, and the fortunate choice of the methods adopted for\r\npromoting the illusion.” But it is needless to dwell upon this\n      point. It is quite certain that the operations of the Automaton\n      are regulated by _mind, _and by nothing else. Indeed this matter\n      is susceptible of a mathematical demonstration, _a priori. _The\n      only question then is of the _manner _in which human agency is\n      brought to bear. Before entering upon this subject it would be as\n      well to give a brief history and description of the Chess-Player\n      for the benefit of such of our readers as may never have had an\r\nopportunity of witnessing Mr. Maelzel’s exhibition.\n\n      The Automaton Chess-Player was invented in 1769, by Baron\n      Kempelen, a nobleman of Presburg, in Hungary, who afterwards\n      disposed of it, together with the secret of its operations, to\n      its present possessor. {2*} Soon after its completion it was\n      exhibited in Presburg, Paris, Vienna, and other continental\n      cities. In 1783 and 1784, it was taken to London by Mr. Maelzel.\n      Of late years it has visited the principal towns in the United\n      States. Wherever seen, the most intense curiosity was excited by","its appearance, and numerous have been the attempts, by men of\n      all classes, to fathom the mystery of its evolutions. The cut on\n      this page gives a tolerable representation of the figure as seen\n      by the citizens of Richmond a few weeks ago. The right arm,\n      however, should lie more at length upon the box, a chess-board\n      should appear upon it, and the cushion should not be seen while\n      the pipe is held. Some immaterial alterations have been made in\n      the costume of the player since it came into the possession of\r\nMaelzel—the plume, for example, was not originally worn. {image\n      of automaton}\n\n      At the hour appointed for exhibition, a curtain is withdrawn, or\n      folding doors are thrown open, and the machine rolled to within\n      about twelve feet of the nearest of the spectators, between whom\n      and it (the machine) a rope is stretched. A figure is seen\n      habited as a Turk, and seated, with its legs crossed, at a large\n      box apparently of maple wood, which serves it as a table. The\n      exhibiter will, if requested, roll the machine to any portion of\r\nthe room, suffer it to remain altogether on any designated spot,\n      or even shift its location repeatedly during the progress of a\n      game. The bottom of the box is elevated considerably above the\n      floor by means of the castors or brazen rollers on which it\n      moves, a clear view of the surface immediately beneath the\n      Automaton being thus afforded to the spectators. The chair on\n      which the figure sits is affixed permanently to the box. On the\n      top of this latter is a chess-board, also permanently affixed.\r\nThe right arm of the Chess-Player is extended at full length\n      before him, at right angles with his body, and lying, in an\n      apparently careless position, by the side of the board. The back\n      of the hand is upwards. The board itself is eighteen inches\n      square. The left arm of the figure is bent at the elbow, and in\n      the left hand is a pipe. A green drapery conceals the back of the\n      Turk, and falls partially over the front of both shoulders. To\n      judge from the external appearance of the box, it is divided into","five compartments—three cupboards of equal dimensions, and two\n      drawers occupying that portion of the chest lying beneath the\n      cupboards. The foregoing observations apply to the appearance of\n      the Automaton upon its first introduction into the presence of\n      the spectators.\n\n      Maelzel now informs the company that he will disclose to their\n      view the mechanism of the machine. Taking from his pocket a bunch\n      of keys he unlocks with one of them, door marked ~ in the cut\n      above, and throws the cupboard fully open to the inspection of\r\nall present. Its whole interior is apparently filled with wheels,\n      pinions, levers, and other machinery, crowded very closely\n      together, so that the eye can penetrate but a little distance\n      into the mass. Leaving this door open to its full extent, he goes\n      now round to the back of the box, and raising the drapery of the\n      figure, opens another door situated precisely in the rear of the\n      one first opened. Holding a lighted candle at this door, and\n      shifting the position of the whole machine repeatedly at the same\r\ntime, a bright light is thrown entirely through the cupboard,\n      which is now clearly seen to be full, completely full, of\n      machinery. The spectators being satisfied of this fact, Maelzel\n      closes the back door, locks it, takes the key from the lock, lets\n      fall the drapery of the figure, and comes round to the front. The\n      door marked I, it will be remembered, is still open. The\n      exhibiter now proceeds to open the drawer which lies beneath the\n      cupboards at the bottom of the box—for although there are\r\napparently two drawers, there is really only one—the two handles\n      and two key holes being intended merely for ornament. Having\n      opened this drawer to its full extent, a small cushion, and a set\n      of chessmen, fixed in a frame work made to support them\n      perpendicularly, are discovered. Leaving this drawer, as well as\n      cupboard No. 1 open, Maelzel now unlocks door No. 2, and door No.\n      3, which are discovered to be folding doors, opening into one and\n      the same compartment. To the right of this compartment, however,","(that is to say the spectators’ right) a small division, six\n      inches wide, and filled with machinery, is partitioned off. The\n      main compartment itself (in speaking of that portion of the box\n      visible upon opening doors 2 and 3, we shall always call it the\n      main compartment) is lined with dark cloth and contains no\n      machinery whatever beyond two pieces of steel, quadrant-shaped,\n      and situated one in each of the rear top corners of the\n      compartment. A small protuberance about eight inches square, and\r\nalso covered with dark cloth, lies on the floor of the\n      compartment near the rear corner on the spectators’ left hand.\n      Leaving doors No. 2 and No. 3 open as well as the drawer, and\n      door No. I, the exhibiter now goes round to the back of the main\n      compartment, and, unlocking another door there, displays clearly\n      all the interior of the main compartment, by introducing a candle\n      behind it and within it. The whole box being thus apparently\n      disclosed to the scrutiny of the company, Maelzel, still leaving\r\nthe doors and drawer open, rolls the Automaton entirely round,\n      and exposes the back of the Turk by lifting up the drapery. A\n      door about ten inches square is thrown open in the loins of the\n      figure, and a smaller one also in the left thigh. The interior of\n      the figure, as seen through these apertures, appears to be\n      crowded with machinery. In general, every spectator is now\n      thoroughly satisfied of having beheld and completely scrutinized,\n      at one and the same time, every individual portion of the\r\nAutomaton, and the idea of any person being concealed in the\n      interior, during so complete an exhibition of that interior, if\n      ever entertained, is immediately dismissed as preposterous in the\n      extreme.\n\n      M. Maelzel, having rolled the machine back into its original\n      position, now informs the company that the Automaton will play a\n      game of chess with any one disposed to encounter him. This\n      challenge being accepted, a small table is prepared for the\n      antagonist, and placed close by the rope, but on the spectators’","side of it, and so situated as not to prevent the company from\n      obtaining a full view of the Automaton. From a drawer in this\n      table is taken a set of chess-men, and Maelzel arranges them\n      generally, but not always, with his own hands, on the chess\n      board, which consists merely of the usual number of squares\n      painted upon the table. The antagonist having taken his seat, the\n      exhibiter approaches the drawer of the box, and takes therefrom\n      the cushion, which, after removing the pipe from the hand of the\r\nAutomaton, he places under its left arm as a support. Then taking\n      also from the drawer the Automaton’s set of chess-men, he\n      arranges them upon the chessboard before the figure. He now\n      proceeds to close the doors and to lock them—leaving the bunch of\n      keys in door No. 1. He also closes the drawer, and, finally,\n      winds up the machine, by applying a key to an aperture in the\n      left end (the spectators’ left) of the box. The game now\n      commences—the Automaton taking the first move. The duration of\n      the contest is usually limited to half an hour, but if it be not\r\nfinished at the expiration of this period, and the antagonist\n      still contend that he can beat the Automaton, M. Maelzel has\n      seldom any objection to continue it. Not to weary the company, is\n      the ostensible, and no doubt the real object of the limitation.\n      It Wits of course be understood that when a move is made at his\n      own table, by the antagonist, the corresponding move is made at\n      the box of the Automaton, by Maelzel himself, who then acts as\n      the representative of the antagonist. On the other hand, when the\r\nTurk moves, the corresponding move is made at the table of the\n      antagonist, also by M. Maelzel, who then acts as the\n      representative of the Automaton. In this manner it is necessary\n      that the exhibiter should often pass from one table to the other.\n      He also frequently goes in rear of the figure to remove the\n      chess-men which it has taken, and which it deposits, when taken,\n      on the box to the left (to its own left) of the board. When the\n      Automaton hesitates in relation to its move, the exhibiter is","occasionally seen to place himself very near its right side, and\n      to lay his hand, now and then, in a careless manner upon the box.\n      He has also a peculiar shuffle with his feet, calculated to\n      induce suspicion of collusion with the machine in minds which are\n      more cunning than sagacious. These peculiarities are, no doubt,\n      mere mannerisms of M. Maelzel, or, if he is aware of them at all,\n      he puts them in practice with a view of exciting in the\n      spectators a false idea of the pure mechanism in the Automaton.\r\nThe Turk plays with his left hand. All the movements of the arm\n      are at right angles. In this manner, the hand (which is gloved\n      and bent in a natural way,) being brought directly above the\n      piece to be moved, descends finally upon it, the fingers\n      receiving it, in most cases, without difficulty. Occasionally,\n      however, when the piece is not precisely in its proper situation,\n      the Automaton fails in his attempt at seizing it. When this\n      occurs, no second effort is made, but the arm continues its\n      movement in the direction originally intended, precisely as if\r\nthe piece were in the fingers. Having thus designated the spot\n      whither the move should have been made, the arm returns to its\n      cushion, and Maelzel performs the evolution which the Automaton\n      pointed out. At every movement of the figure machinery is heard\n      in motion. During the progress of the game, the figure now and\n      then rolls its eyes, as if surveying the board, moves its head,\n      and pronounces the word _echec _(check) when necessary. {*3} If a\n      false move be made by his antagonist, he raps briskly on the box\r\nwith the fingers of his right hand, shakes his head roughly, and\n      replacing the piece falsely moved, in its former situation,\n      assumes the next move himself. Upon beating the game, he waves\n      his head with an air of triumph, looks round complacently upon\n      the spectators, and drawing his left arm farther back than usual,\n      suffers his fingers alone to rest upon the cushion. In general,\n      the Turk is victorious—once or twice he has been beaten. The game\n      being ended, Maelzel will again if desired, exhibit the mechanism","of the box, in the same manner as before. The machine is then\n      rolled back, and a curtain hides it from the view of the company.\n\n      There have been many attempts at solving the mystery of the\n      Automaton. The most general opinion in relation to it, an opinion\n      too not unfrequently adopted by men who should have known better,\n      was, as we have before said, that no immediate human agency was\n      employed—in other words, that the machine was purely a machine\n      and nothing else. Many, however maintained that the exhibiter\r\nhimself regulated the movements of the figure by mechanical means\n      operating through the feet of the box. Others again, spoke\n      confidently of a magnet. Of the first of these opinions we shall\n      say nothing at present more than we have already said. In\n      relation to the second it is only necessary to repeat what we\n      have before stated, that the machine is rolled about on castors,\n      and will, at the request of a spectator, be moved to and fro to\n      any portion of the room, even during the progress of a game. The\r\nsupposition of the magnet is also untenable—for if a magnet were\n      the agent, any other magnet in the pocket of a spectator would\n      disarrange the entire mechanism. The exhibiter, however, will\n      suffer the most powerful loadstone to remain even upon the box\n      during the whole of the exhibition.\n\n      The first attempt at a written explanation of the secret, at\n      least the first attempt of which we ourselves have any knowledge,\n      was made in a large pamphlet printed at Paris in 1785. The\n      author’s hypothesis amounted to this—that a dwarf actuated the\r\nmachine. This dwarf he supposed to conceal himself during the\n      opening of the box by thrusting his legs into two hollow\n      cylinders, which were represented to be (but which are not) among\n      the machinery in the cupboard No. I, while his body was out of\n      the box entirely, and covered by the drapery of the Turk. When\n      the doors were shut, the dwarf was enabled to bring his body\n      within the box—the noise produced by some portion of the\n      machinery allowing him to do so unheard, and also to close the","door by which he entered. The interior of the automaton being\n      then exhibited, and no person discovered, the spectators, says\n      the author of this pamphlet, are satisfied that no one is within\n      any portion of the machine. This whole hypothesis was too\n      obviously absurd to require comment, or refutation, and\n      accordingly we find that it attracted very little attention.\n\n      In 1789 a book was published at Dresden by M. I. F. Freyhere in\n      which another endeavor was made to unravel the mystery. Mr.\n      Freyhere’s book was a pretty large one, and copiously illustrated\r\nby colored engravings. His supposition was that “a well-taught\n      boy very thin and tall of his age (sufficiently so that he could\n      be concealed in a drawer almost immediately under the\n      chess-board”) played the game of chess and effected all the\n      evolutions of the Automaton. This idea, although even more silly\n      than that of the Parisian author, met with a better reception,\n      and was in some measure believed to be the true solution of the\n      wonder, until the inventor put an end to the discussion by\r\nsuffering a close examination of the top of the box.\n\n      These bizarre attempts at explanation were followed by others\n      equally bizarre. Of late years however, an anonymous writer, by a\n      course of reasoning exceedingly unphilosophical, has contrived to\n      blunder upon a plausible solution—although we cannot consider it\n      altogether the true one. His Essay was first published in a\n      Baltimore weekly paper, was illustrated by cuts, and was entitled\n      “An attempt to analyze the Automaton Chess-Player of M. Maelzel.”\r\nThis Essay we suppose to have been the original of the _pamphlet\n      to _which Sir David Brewster alludes in his letters on Natural\n      Magic, and which he has no hesitation in declaring a thorough and\n      satisfactory explanation. The _results _of the analysis are\n      undoubtedly, in the main, just; but we can only account for\n      Brewster’s pronouncing the Essay a thorough and satisfactory\n      explanation, by supposing him to have bestowed upon it a very\n      cursory and inattentive perusal. In the compendium of the Essay,","made use of in the Letters on Natural Magic, it is quite\n      impossible to arrive at any distinct conclusion in regard to the\n      adequacy or inadequacy of the analysis, on account of the gross\n      misarrangement and deficiency of the letters of reference\n      employed. The same fault is to be found in the “Attempt &c.,” as\n      we originally saw it. The solution consists in a series of minute\n      explanations, (accompanied by wood-cuts, the whole occupying many\n      pages) in which the object is to show the _possibility _of _so\r\nshifting the partitions _of the box, as to allow a human being,\n      concealed in the interior, to move portions of his body from one\n      part of the box to another, during the exhibition of the\n      mechanism—thus eluding the scrutiny of the spectators. There can\n      be no doubt, as we have before observed, and as we will presently\n      endeavor to show, that the principle, or rather the result, of\n      this solution is the true one. Some person is concealed in the\n      box during the whole time of exhibiting the interior. We object,\r\nhowever, to the whole verbose description of the _manner _in\n      which the partitions are shifted, to accommodate the movements of\n      the person concealed. We object to it as a mere theory assumed in\n      the first place, and to which circumstances are afterwards made\n      to adapt themselves. It was not, and could not have been, arrived\n      at by any inductive reasoning. In whatever way the shifting is\n      managed, it is of course concealed at every step from\n      observation. To show that certain movements might possibly be\r\neffected in a certain way, is very far from showing that they are\n      actually so effected. There may be an infinity of other methods\n      by which the same results may be obtained. The probability of the\n      one assumed proving the correct one is then as unity to infinity.\n      But, in reality, this particular point, the shifting of the\n      partitions, is of no consequence whatever. It was altogether\n      unnecessary to devote seven or eight pages for the purpose of\n      proving what no one in his senses would deny—viz: that the","wonderful mechanical genius of Baron Kempelen could invent the\n      necessary means for shutting a door or slipping aside a pannel,\n      with a human agent too at his service in actual contact with the\n      pannel or the door, and the whole operations carried on, as the\n      author of the Essay himself shows, and as we shall attempt to\n      show more fully hereafter, entirely out of reach of the\n      observation of the spectators.\n\n      In attempting ourselves an explanation of the Automaton, we will,\r\nin the first place, endeavor to show how its operations are\n      effected, and afterwards describe, as briefly as possible, the\n      nature of the _observations _from which we have deduced our\n      result.\n\n      It will be necessary for a proper understanding of the subject,\n      that we repeat here in a few words, the routine adopted by the\n      exhibiter in disclosing the interior of the box—a routine from\n      which he _never _deviates in any material particular. In the\n      first place he opens the door No. I. Leaving this open, he goes\r\nround to the rear of the box, and opens a door precisely at the\n      back of door No. I. To this back door he holds a lighted candle.\n      He then _closes the back door, _locks it, and, coming round to\n      the front, opens the drawer to its full extent. This done, he\n      opens the doors No. 2 and No. 3, (the folding doors) and displays\n      the interior of the main compartment. Leaving open the main\n      compartment, the drawer, and the front door of cupboard No. I, he\n      now goes to the rear again, and throws open the back door of the\r\nmain compartment. In shutting up the box no particular order is\n      observed, except that the folding doors are always closed before\n      the drawer.\n\n      Now, let us suppose that when the machine is first rolled into\n      the presence of the spectators, a man is already within it. His\n      body is situated behind the dense machinery in cupboard No. T.\n      (the rear portion of which machinery is so contrived as to slip\n      _en masse, _from the main compartment to the cupboard No. I, as\n      occasion may require,) and his legs lie at full length in the","main compartment. When Maelzel opens the door No. I, the man\n      within is not in any danger of discovery, for the keenest eye\n      cannot penetrate more than about two inches into the darkness\n      within. But the case is otherwise when the back door of the\n      cupboard No. I, is opened. A bright light then pervades the\n      cupboard, and the body of the man would be discovered if it were\n      there. But it is not. The putting the key in the lock of the back\n      door was a signal on hearing which the person concealed brought\n      his body forward to an angle as acute as possible—throwing it\r\naltogether, or nearly so, into the main compartment. This,\n      however, is a painful position, and cannot be long maintained.\n      Accordingly we find that Maelzel _closes the back door. _This\n      being done, there is no reason why the body of the man may not\n      resume its former situation—for the cupboard is again so dark as\n      to defy scrutiny. The drawer is now opened, and the legs of the\n      person within drop down behind it in the space it formerly\n      occupied. {*4} There is, consequently, now no longer any part of\r\nthe man in the main compartment—his body being behind the\n      machinery in cupboard No. 1, and his legs in the space occupied\n      by the drawer. The exhibiter, therefore, finds himself at liberty\n      to display the main compartment. This he does—opening both its\n      back and front doors—and no person Is discovered. The spectators\n      are now satisfied that the whole of the box is exposed to\n      view—and exposed too, all portions of it at one and the same\n      time. But of course this is not the case. They neither see the\r\nspace behind the drawer, nor the interior of cupboard No. 1—the\n      front door of which latter the exhibiter virtually shuts in\n      shutting its back door. Maelzel, having now rolled the machine\n      around, lifted up the drapery of the Turk, opened the doors in\n      his back and thigh, and shown his trunk to be full of machinery,\n      brings the whole back into its original position, and closes the\n      doors. The man within is now at liberty to move about. He gets up\n      into the body of the Turk just so high as to bring his eyes above","the level of the chess-board. It is very probable that he seats\n      himself upon the little square block or protuberance which is\n      seen in a corner of the main compartment when the doors are open.\n      In this position he sees the chess-board through the bosom of the\n      Turk which is of gauze. Bringing his right arm across his breast\n      he actuates the little machinery necessary to guide the left arm\n      and the fingers of the figure. This machinery is situated just\n      beneath the left shoulder of the Turk, and is consequently easily\r\nreached by the right hand of the man concealed, if we suppose his\n      right arm brought across the breast. The motions of the head and\n      eyes, and of the right arm of the figure, as well as the sound\n      _echec _are produced by other mechanism in the interior, and\n      actuated at will by the man within. The whole of this\n      mechanism—that is to say all the mechanism essential to the\n      machine—is most probably contained within the little cupboard (of\n      about six inches in breadth) partitioned off at the right (the\r\nspectators’ right) of the main compartment.\n\n      In this analysis of the operations of the Automaton, we have\n      purposely avoided any allusion to the manner in which the\n      partitions are shifted, and it will now be readily comprehended\n      that this point is a matter of no importance, since, by mechanism\n      within the ability of any common carpenter, it might be effected\n      in an infinity of different ways, and since we have shown that,\n      however performed, it is performed out of the view of the\r\nspectators. Our result is founded upon the following\n      _observations _taken during frequent visits to the exhibition of\n      Maelzel. {*5}\n\n      I. The moves of the Turk are not made at regular intervals of\n      time, but accommodate themselves to the moves of the\n      antagonist—although this point (of regularity) so important in\n      all kinds of mechanical contrivance, might have been readily\n      brought about by limiting the time allowed for the moves of the\n      antagonist. For example, if this limit were three minutes, the","moves of the Automaton might be made at any given intervals\n      longer than three minutes. The fact then of irregularity, when\n      regularity might have been so easily attained, goes to prove that\n      regularity is unimportant to the action of the Automaton—in other\n      words, that the Automaton is not a _pure machine._\n\n      2. When the Automaton is about to move a piece, a distinct motion\n      is observable just beneath the left shoulder, and which motion\n      agitates in a slight degree, the drapery covering the front of\r\nthe left shoulder. This motion invariably precedes, by about two\n      seconds, the movement of the arm itself—and the arm never, in any\n      instance, moves without this preparatory motion in the shoulder.\n      Now let the antagonist move a piece, and let the corresponding\n      move be made by Maelzel, as usual, upon the board of the\n      Automaton. Then let the antagonist narrowly watch the Automaton,\n      until he detect the preparatory motion in the shoulder.\n      Immediately upon detecting this motion, and before the arm itself\r\nbegins to move, let him withdraw his piece, as if perceiving an\n      error in his manœuvre. It will then be seen that the movement of\n      the arm, which, in all other cases, immediately succeeds the\n      motion in the shoulder, is withheld—is not made—although Maelzel\n      has not yet performed, on the board of the Automaton, any move\n      corresponding to the withdrawal of the antagonist. In this case,\n      that the Automaton was about to move is evident—and that he did\n      not move, was an effect plainly produced by the withdrawal of the\r\nantagonist, and without any intervention of Maelzel.\n\n      This fact fully proves, 1—that the intervention of Maelzel, in\n      performing the moves of the antagonist on the board of the\n      Automaton, is not essential to the movements of the Automaton,\n      2—that its movements are regulated by _mind—_by some person who\n      sees the board of the antagonist, 3—that its movements are not\n      regulated by the mind of Maelzel, whose back was turned towards\n      the antagonist at the withdrawal of his move.\n\n      3. The Automaton does not invariably win the game. Were the","machine a pure machine this would not be the case—it would always\n      win. The _principle _being discovered by which a machine can be\n      made to _play _a game of chess, an extension of the same\n      principle would enable it to win a game—a farther extension would\n      enable it to win _all _games—that is, to beat any possible game\n      of an antagonist. A little consideration will convince any one\n      that the difficulty of making a machine beat all games, Is not in\n      the least degree greater, as regards the principle of the\r\noperations necessary, than that of making it beat a single game.\n      If then we regard the Chess-Player as a machine, we must suppose,\n      (what is highly improbable,) that its inventor preferred leaving\n      it incomplete to perfecting it—a supposition rendered still more\n      absurd, when we reflect that the leaving it incomplete would\n      afford an argument against the possibility of its being a pure\n      machine—the very argument we now adduce.\n\n      4. When the situation of the game is difficult or complex, we\r\nnever perceive the Turk either shake his head or roll his eyes.\n      It is only when his next move is obvious, or when the game is so\n      circumstanced that to a man in the Automaton’s place there would\n      be no necessity for reflection. Now these peculiar movements of\n      the head and eyes are movements customary with persons engaged in\n      meditation, and the ingenious Baron Kempelen would have adapted\n      these movements (were the machine a pure machine) to occasions\n      proper for their display—that is, to occasions of complexity. But\r\nthe reverse is seen to be the case, and this reverse applies\n      precisely to our supposition of a man in the interior. When\n      engaged in meditation about the game he has no time to think of\n      setting in motion the mechanism of the Automaton by which are\n      moved the head and the eyes. When the game, however, is obvious,\n      he has time to look about him, and, accordingly, we see the head\n      shake and the eyes roll.\n\n      5. When the machine is rolled round to allow the spectators an\n      examination of the back of the Turk, and when his drapery is","lifted up and the doors in the trunk and thigh thrown open, the\n      interior of the trunk is seen to be crowded with machinery. In\n      scrutinizing this machinery while the Automaton was in motion,\n      that is to say while the whole machine was moving on the castors,\n      it appeared to us that certain portions of the mechanism changed\n      their shape and position in a degree too great to be accounted\n      for by the simple laws of perspective; and subsequent\n      examinations convinced us that these undue alterations were\n      attributable to mirrors in the interior of the trunk. The\r\nintroduction of mirrors among the machinery could not have been\n      intended to influence, in any degree, the machinery itself. Their\n      operation, whatever that operation should prove to be, must\n      necessarily have reference to the eye of the spectator. We at\n      once concluded that these mirrors were so placed to multiply to\n      the vision some few pieces of machinery within the trunk so as to\n      give it the appearance of being crowded with mechanism. Now the\n      direct inference from this is that the machine is not a pure\r\nmachine. For if it were, the inventor, so far from wishing its\n      mechanism to appear complex, and using deception for the purpose\n      of giving it this appearance, would have been especially desirous\n      of convincing those who witnessed his exhibition, of the\n      _simplicity _of the means by which results so wonderful were\n      brought about.\n\n      6. The external appearance, and, especially, the deportment of\n      the Turk, are, when we consider them as imitations of _life, _but\n      very indifferent imitations. The countenance evinces no\r\ningenuity, and is surpassed, in its resemblance to the human\n      face, by the very commonest of wax-works. The eyes roll\n      unnaturally in the head, without any corresponding motions of the\n      lids or brows. The arm, particularly, performs its operations in\n      an exceedingly stiff, awkward, jerking, and rectangular manner.\n      Now, all this is the result either of inability in Maelzel to do\n      better, or of intentional neglect—accidental neglect being out of\n      the question, when we consider that the whole time of the","ingenious proprietor is occupied in the improvement of his\n      machines. Most assuredly we must not refer the unlife-like\n      appearances to inability—for all the rest of Maelzel’s automata\n      are evidence of his full ability to copy the motions and\n      peculiarities of life with the most wonderful exactitude. The\n      rope-dancers, for example, are inimitable. When the clown laughs,\n      his lips, his eyes, his eye-brows, and eyelids—indeed, all the\n      features of his countenance—are imbued with their appropriate\n      expressions. In both him and his companion, every gesture is so\r\nentirely easy, and free from the semblance of artificiality,\n      that, were it not for the diminutiveness of their size, and the\n      fact of their being passed from one spectator to another previous\n      to their exhibition on the rope, it would be difficult to\n      convince any assemblage of persons that these wooden automata\n      were not living creatures. We cannot, therefore, doubt Mr.\n      Maelzel’s ability, and we must necessarily suppose that he\n      intentionally suffered his Chess Player to remain the same\r\nartificial and unnatural figure which Baron Kempelen (no doubt\n      also through design) originally made it. What this design was it\n      is not difficult to conceive. Were the Automaton life-like in its\n      motions, the spectator would be more apt to attribute its\n      operations to their true cause, (that is, to human agency within)\n      than he is now, when the awkward and rectangular manœuvres convey\n      the idea of pure and unaided mechanism.\n\n      7. When, a short time previous to the commencement of the game,\r\nthe Automaton is wound up by the exhibiter as usual, an ear in\n      any degree accustomed to the sounds produced in winding up a\n      system of machinery, will not fail to discover, instantaneously,\n      that the axis turned by the key in the box of the Chess-Player,\n      cannot possibly be connected with either a weight, a spring, or\n      any system of machinery whatever. The inference here is the same\n      as in our last observation. The winding up is inessential to the\n      operations of the Automaton, and is performed with the design of","exciting in the spectators the false idea of mechanism.\n\n      8. When the question is demanded explicitly of Maelzel—“Is the\n      Automaton a pure machine or not?” his reply is invariably the\n      same—“I will say nothing about it.” Now the notoriety of the\n      Automaton, and the great curiosity it has every where excited,\n      are owing more especially to the prevalent opinion that it is a\n      pure machine, than to any other circumstance. Of course, then, it\n      is the interest of the proprietor to represent it as a pure\r\nmachine. And what more obvious, and more effectual method could\n      there be of impressing the spectators with this desired idea,\n      than a positive and explicit declaration to that effect? On the\n      other hand, what more obvious and effectual method could there be\n      of exciting a disbelief in the Automaton’s being a pure machine,\n      than by withholding such explicit declaration? For, people will\n      naturally reason thus,—It is Maelzel’s interest to represent this\n      thing a pure machine—he refuses to do so, directly, in words,\r\nalthough he does not scruple, and is evidently anxious to do so,\n      indirectly by actions—were it actually what he wishes to\n      represent it by actions, he would gladly avail himself of the\n      more direct testimony of words—the inference is, that a\n      consciousness of its not being a pure machine, is the reason of\n      his silence—his actions cannot implicate him in a falsehood—his\n      words may.\n\n      9. When, in exhibiting the interior of the box, Maelzel has\n      thrown open the door No. I, and also the door immediately behind\r\nit, he holds a lighted candle at the back door (as mentioned\n      above) and moves the entire machine to and fro with a view of\n      convincing the company that the cupboard No. 1 is entirely filled\n      with machinery. When the machine is thus moved about, it will be\n      apparent to any careful observer, that whereas that portion of\n      the machinery near the front door No. 1, is perfectly steady and\n      unwavering, the portion farther within fluctuates, in a very\n      slight degree, with the movements of the machine. This","circumstance first aroused in us the suspicion that the more\n      remote portion of the machinery was so arranged as to be easily\n      slipped, _en masse, _from its position when occasion should\n      require it. This occasion we have already stated to occur when\n      the man concealed within brings his body into an erect position\n      upon the closing of the back door.\n\n      10. Sir David Brewster states the figure of the Turk to be of the\n      size of life—but in fact it is far above the ordinary size.\r\nNothing is more easy than to err in our notions of magnitude. The\n      body of the Automaton is generally insulated, and, having no\n      means of immediately comparing it with any human form, we suffer\n      ourselves to consider it as of ordinary dimensions. This mistake\n      may, however, be corrected by observing the Chess-Player when, as\n      is sometimes the case, the exhibiter approaches it. Mr. Maelzel,\n      to be sure, is not very tall, but upon drawing near the machine,\n      his head will be found at least eighteen inches below the head of\r\nthe Turk, although the latter, it will be remembered, is in a\n      sitting position.\n\n      11. The box behind which the Automaton is placed, is precisely\n      three feet six inches long, two feet four inches deep, and two\n      feet six inches high. These dimensions are fully sufficient for\n      the accommodation of a man very much above the common size—and\n      the main compartment alone is capable of holding any ordinary man\n      in the position we have mentioned as assumed by the person\n      concealed. As these are facts, which any one who doubts them may\r\nprove by actual calculation, we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon\n      them. We will only suggest that, although the top of the box is\n      apparently a board of about three inches in thickness, the\n      spectator may satisfy himself by stooping and looking up at it\n      when the main compartment is open, that it is in reality very\n      thin. The height of the drawer also will be misconceived by those\n      who examine it in a cursory manner. There is a space of about\n      three inches between the top of the drawer as seen from the","exterior, and the bottom of the cupboard—a space which must be\n      included in the height of the drawer. These contrivances to make\n      the room within the box appear less than it actually is, are\n      referrible to a design on the part of the inventor, to impress\n      the company again with a false idea, viz. that no human being can\n      be accommodated within the box.\n\n      12. The interior of the main compartment is lined throughout with\n      _cloth. _This cloth we suppose to have a twofold object. A\n      portion of _it _may form, when tightly stretched, the only\r\npartitions which there is any necessity for removing during the\n      changes of the man’s position, viz: the partition between the\n      rear of the main compartment and the rear of the cupboard No. 1,\n      and the partition between the main compartment, and the space\n      behind the drawer when open. If we imagine this to be the case,\n      the difficulty of shifting the partitions vanishes at once, if\n      indeed any such difficulty could be supposed under any\n      circumstances to exist. The second object of the cloth is to\r\ndeaden and render indistinct all sounds occasioned by the\n      movements of the person within.\n\n      13. The antagonist (as we have before observed) is not suffered\n      to play at the board of the Automaton, but is seated at some\n      distance from the machine. The reason which, most probably, would\n      be assigned for this circumstance, if the question were demanded,\n      is, that were the antagonist otherwise situated, his person would\n      intervene between the machine and the spectators, and preclude\n      the latter from a distinct view. But this difficulty might be\r\neasily obviated, either by elevating the seats of the company, or\n      by turning the end of the box towards them during the game. The\n      true cause of the restriction is, perhaps, very different. Were\n      the antagonist seated in contact with the box, the secret would\n      be liable to discovery, by his detecting, with the aid of a quick\n      car, the breathings of the man concealed.\n\n      14. Although M. Maelzel, in disclosing the interior of the\n      machine, sometimes slightly deviates from the _routine _which we","have pointed out, yet _reeler in _any instance does he _so\n      _deviate from it as to interfere with our solution. For example,\n      he has been known to open, first of all, the drawer—but he never\n      opens the main compartment without first closing the back door of\n      cupboard No. 1—he never opens the main compartment without first\n      pulling out the drawer—he never shuts the drawer without first\n      shutting the main compartment—he never opens the back door of\n      cupboard No. 1 while the main compartment is open—and the game of\r\nchess is never commenced until the whole machine is closed. Now\n      if it were observed that _never, in any single instance, _did M.\n      Maelzel differ from the routine we have pointed out as necessary\n      to our solution, it would be one of the strongest possible\n      arguments in corroboration of it—but the argument becomes\n      infinitely strengthened if we duly consider the circumstance that\n      he _does occasionally _deviate from the routine but never does\n      _so _deviate as to falsify the solution.\r\n15. There are six candles on the board of the Automaton during\n      exhibition. The question naturally arises—“Why are so many\n      employed, when a single candle, or, at farthest, two, would have\n      been amply sufficient to afford the spectators a clear view of\n      the board, in a room otherwise so well lit up as the exhibition\n      room always is—when, moreover, if we suppose the machine a _pure\n      machine, _there can be no necessity for so much light, or indeed\n      any light at all, to enable _it _to perform its operations—and\r\nwhen, especially, only a single candle is placed upon the table\n      of the antagonist?” The first and most obvious inference is, that\n      so strong a light is requisite to enable the man within to see\n      through the transparent material (probably fine gauze) of which\n      the breast of the Turk is composed. But when we consider the\n      arrangement of the candles, another reason immediately presents\n      itself. There are six lights (as we have said before) in all.\n      Three of these are on each side of the figure. Those most remote","from the spectators are the longest—those in the middle are about\n      two inches shorter—and those nearest the company about two inches\n      shorter still—and the candles on one side differ in height from\n      the candles respectively opposite on the other, by a ratio\n      different from two inches—that is to say, the longest candle on\n      one side is about three inches shorter than the longest candle on\n      the other, and so on. Thus it will be seen that no two of the\n      candles are of the same height, and thus also the difficulty of\r\nascertaining the _material _of the breast of the figure (against\n      which the light is especially directed) is greatly augmented by\n      the dazzling effect of the complicated crossings of the\n      rays—crossings which are brought about by placing the centres of\n      radiation all upon different levels.\n\n      16. While the Chess-Player was in possession of Baron Kempelen,\n      it was more than once observed, first, that an Italian in the\n      suite of the Baron was never visible during the playing of a game\n      at chess by the Turk, and, secondly, that the Italian being taken\r\nseriously ill, the exhibition was suspended until his recovery.\n      This Italian professed a _total _ignorance of the game of chess,\n      although all others of the suite played well. Similar\n      observations have been made since the Automaton has been\n      purchased by Maelzel. There is a man, _Schlumberoer, _who attends\n      him wherever he goes, but who has no ostensible occupation other\n      than that of assisting in the packing and unpacking of the\n      automata. This man is about the medium size, and has a remarkable\r\nstoop in the shoulders. Whether he professes to play chess or\n      not, we are not informed. It is quite certain, however, that he\n      is never to be seen during the exhibition of the Chess-Player,\n      although frequently visible just before and just after the\n      exhibition. Moreover, some years ago Maelzel visited Richmond\n      with his automata, and exhibited them, we believe, in the house\n      now occupied by M. Bossieux as a Dancing Academy. _Schlumberg_er\n      was suddenly taken ill, and during his illness there was no","exhibition of the Chess-Player. These facts are well known to\n      many of our citizens. The reason assigned for the suspension of\n      the Chess-Player’s performances, was _not _the illness of\n      _Schlumberger. _The inferences from all this we leave, without\n      farther comment, to the reader.\n\n      17. The Turk plays with his _left_ arm. A circumstance so\n      remarkable cannot be accidental. Brewster takes no notice of it\n      whatever beyond a mere statement, we believe, that such is the\n      fact. The early writers of treatises on the Automaton, seem not\r\nto have observed the matter at all, and have no reference to it.\n      The author of the pamphlet alluded to by Brewster, mentions it,\n      but acknowledges his inability to account for it. Yet it is\n      obviously from such prominent discrepancies or incongruities as\n      this that deductions are to be made (if made at all) which shall\n      lead us to the truth.\n\n      The circumstance of the Automaton’s playing with his left hand\n      cannot have connexion with the operations of the machine,\r\nconsidered merely as such. Any mechanical arrangement which would\n      cause the figure to move, in any given manner, the left\n      arm—could, if reversed, cause it to move, in the same manner, the\n      right. But these principles cannot be extended to the human\n      organization, wherein there is a marked and radical difference in\n      the construction, and, at all events, in the powers, of the right\n      and left arms. Reflecting upon this latter fact, we naturally\n      refer the incongruity noticeable in the Chess-Player to this\r\npeculiarity in the human organization. If so, we must imagine\n      some _reversion—_for the Chess-Player plays precisely as a man\n      _would not. _These ideas, once entertained, are sufficient of\n      themselves, to suggest the notion of a man in the interior. A few\n      more imperceptible steps lead us, finally, to the result. The\n      Automaton plays with his left arm, because under no other\n      circumstances could the man within play with his right—a\n      _desideratum _of course. Let us, for example, imagine the\n      Automaton to play with his right arm. To reach the machinery","which moves the arm, and which we have before explained to lie\n      just beneath the shoulder, it would be necessary for the man\n      within either to use his right arm in an exceedingly painful and\n      awkward position, (viz. brought up close to his body and tightly\n      compressed between his body and the side of the Automaton,) or\n      else to use his left arm brought across his breast. In neither\n      case could he act with the requisite ease or precision. On the\n      contrary, the Automaton playing, as it actually does, with the\r\nleft arm, all difficulties vanish. The right arm of the man\n      within is brought across his breast, and his right fingers act,\n      without any constraint, upon the machinery in the shoulder of the\n      figure.\n\n      We do not believe that any reasonable objections can be urged\n      against this solution of the Automaton Chess-Player.\n\n\n\n\nTHE POWER OF WORDS\n\n\n      OINOS. Pardon, Agathos, the weakness of a spirit new-fledged with\n      immortality!\n\n      AGATHOS. You have spoken nothing, my Oinos, for which pardon is\n      to be demanded. Not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition.\r\nFor wisdom, ask of the angels freely, that it may be given!\n\n      OINOS. But in this existence, I dreamed that I should be at once\n      cognizant of all things, and thus at once be happy in being\n      cognizant of all.\n\n      AGATHOS. Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the\n      acquisition of knowledge! In for ever knowing, we are for ever\n      blessed; but to know all were the curse of a fiend.\n\n      OINOS. But does not The Most High know all?\n\n      AGATHOS. That (since he is The Most Happy) must be still the one\r\nthing unknown even to Him.\n\n      OINOS. But, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not at last\n      all things be known?\n\n      AGATHOS. Look down into the abysmal distances!—attempt to force\n      the gaze down the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep\n      slowly through them thus—and thus—and thus! Even the spiritual\n      vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden\n      walls of the universe?—the walls of the myriads of the shining\n      bodies that mere number has appeared to blend into unity?","OINOS. I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no\n      dream.\n\n      AGATHOS. There are _no_ dreams in Aidenn—but it is here whispered\n      that, of this infinity of matter, the _sole_ purpose is to afford\n      infinite springs, at which the soul may allay the thirst _to\n      know_, which is for ever unquenchable within it—since to quench\n      it, would be to extinguish the soul’s self. Question me then, my\n      Oinos, freely and without fear. Come! we will leave to the left\n      the loud harmony of the Pleiades, and swoop outward from the\r\nthrone into the starry meadows beyond Orion, where, for pansies\n      and violets, and heart’s-ease, are the beds of the triplicate and\n      triple-tinted suns.\n\n      OINOS. And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!—speak to me\n      in the earth’s familiar tones. I understand not what you hinted\n      to me, just now, of the modes or of the method of what, during\n      mortality, we were accustomed to call Creation. Do you mean to\n      say that the Creator is not God?\n\n      AGATHOS. I mean to say that the Deity does not create.\r\nOINOS. Explain.\n\n      AGATHOS. In the beginning only, he created. The seeming creatures\n      which are now, throughout the universe, so perpetually springing\n      into being, can only be considered as the mediate or indirect,\n      not as the direct or immediate results of the Divine creative\n      power.\n\n      OINOS. Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be considered\n      heretical in the extreme.\n\n      AGATHOS. Among angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be simply true.\n\n      OINOS. I can comprehend you thus far—that certain operations of\r\nwhat we term Nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain\n      conditions, give rise to that which has all the _appearance_ of\n      creation. Shortly before the final overthrow of the earth, there\n      were, I well remember, many very successful experiments in what\n      some philosophers were weak enough to denominate the creation of\n      animalculæ.\n\n      AGATHOS. The cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of\n      the secondary creation—and of the only species of creation which\n      has ever been, since the first word spoke into existence the","first law.\n\n      OINOS. Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of\n      nonentity, burst hourly forth into the heavens—are not these\n      stars, Agathos, the immediate handiwork of the King?\n\n      AGATHOS. Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you, step by step, to\n      the conception I intend. You are well aware that, as no thought\n      can perish, so no act is without infinite result. We moved our\n      hands, for example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and, in\n      so doing, gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it.\r\nThis vibration was indefinitely extended, till it gave impulse to\n      every particle of the earth’s air, which thenceforward, and for\n      ever, was actuated by the one movement of the hand. This fact the\n      mathematicians of our globe well knew. They made the special\n      effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid by special impulses, the\n      subject of exact calculation—so that it became easy to determine\n      in what precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle\n      the orb, and impress (for ever) every atom of the atmosphere\r\ncircumambient. Retrograding, they found no difficulty, from a\n      given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of\n      the original impulse. Now the mathematicians who saw that the\n      results of any given impulse were absolutely endless—and who saw\n      that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through\n      the agency of algebraic analysis—who saw, too, the facility of\n      the retrogradation—these men saw, at the same time, that this\n      species of analysis itself, had within itself a capacity for\r\nindefinite progress—that there were no bounds conceivable to its\n      advancement and applicability, except within the intellect of him\n      who advanced or applied it. But at this point our mathematicians\n      paused.\n\n      OINOS. And why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?\n\n      AGATHOS. Because there were some considerations of deep interest\n      beyond. It was deducible from what they knew, that to a being of\n      infinite understanding—one to whom the perfection of the\n      algebraic analysis lay unfolded—there could be no difficulty in","tracing every impulse given the air—and the ether through the\n      air—to the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote\n      epoch of time. It is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse\n      given the air, must, in the end, impress every individual thing\n      that exists within the universe;—and the being of infinite\n      understanding—the being whom we have imagined—might trace the\n      remote undulations of the impulse—trace them upward and onward in\n      their influences upon all particles of an matter—upward and\r\nonward for ever in their modifications of old forms—or, in other\n      words, in their creation of new—until he found them\n      reflected—unimpressive at last—back from the throne of the\n      Godhead. And not only could such a thing do this, but at any\n      epoch, should a given result be afforded him—should one of these\n      numberless comets, for example, be presented to his inspection—he\n      could have no difficulty in determining, by the analytic\n      retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. This power\r\nof retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection—this\n      faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all causes—is\n      of course the prerogative of the Deity alone—but in every variety\n      of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power itself\n      exercised by the whole host of the Angelic intelligences.\n\n      OINOS. But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.\n\n      AGATHOS. In speaking of the air, I referred only to the earth;\n      but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the\r\nether—which, since it pervades, and alone pervades all space, is\n      thus the great medium of creation.\n\n      OINOS. Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?\n\n      AGATHOS. It must: but a true philosophy has long taught that the\n      source of all motion is thought—and the source of all thought is—\n\n      OINOS. God.\n\n      AGATHOS. I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child of the fair\n      Earth which lately perished—of impulses upon the atmosphere of\n      the Earth.\n\n      OINOS. You did.\n\n      AGATHOS. And while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind","some thought of the physical power of words? Is not every word an\n      impulse on the air?\n\n      OINOS. But why, Agathos, do you weep—and why, oh why do your\n      wings droop as we hover above this fair star—which is the\n      greenest and yet most terrible of all we have encountered in our\n      flight? Its brilliant flowers look like a fairy dream—but its\n      fierce volcanoes like the passions of a turbulent heart.\n\n      AGATHOS. They are!—they are! This wild star—it is now three\n      centuries since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at\r\nthe feet of my beloved—I spoke it—with a few passionate\n      sentences—into birth. Its brilliant flowers are the dearest of\n      all unfulfilled dreams, and its raging volcanoes are the passions\n      of the most turbulent and unhallowed of hearts.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COLLOQUY OF MONOS AND UNA\n\n\nΜελλοντα ταυτα.—SOPHOCLES—_Antig._\n     “These things are in the near future.”\n\n      _ Una._ “Born again?”\n\n      _ Monos._ Yes, fairest and best beloved Una, “born again.” These\n      were the words upon whose mystical meaning I had so long\r\npondered, rejecting the explanations of the priesthood, until\n      Death himself resolved for me the secret.\n\n      _Una._ Death!\n\n      _Monos._ How strangely, sweet Una, you echo my words! I observe,\n      too, a vacillation in your step—a joyous inquietude in your eyes.\n      You are confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the\n      Life Eternal. Yes, it was of Death I spoke. And here how\n      singularly sounds that word which of old was wont to bring terror\n      to all hearts—throwing a mildew upon all pleasures!\r\n_Una._ Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all feasts! How\n      often, Monos, did we lose ourselves in speculations upon its\n      nature! How mysteriously did it act as a check to human\n      bliss—saying unto it “thus far, and no farther!” That earnest\n      mutual love, my own Monos, which burned within our bosoms—how\n      vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy in its first\n      up-springing, that our happiness would strengthen with its\n      strength! Alas! as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of\n      that evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever! Thus,","in time, it became painful to love. Hate would have been mercy\n      then.\n\n      _Monos._ Speak not here of these griefs, dear Una—mine, mine,\n      forever now!\n\n      _ Una._ But the memory of past sorrow—is it not present joy? I\n      have much to say yet of the things which have been. Above all, I\n      burn to know the incidents of your own passage through the dark\n      Valley and Shadow.\n\n      _ Monos._ And when did the radiant Una ask anything of her Monos\n      in vain? I will be minute in relating all—but at what point shall\n      the weird narrative begin?\r\n_Una._ At what point?\n\n      _Monos._ You have said.\n\n      _Una._ Monos, I comprehend you. In Death we have both learned the\n      propensity of man to define the indefinable. I will not say,\n      then, commence with the moment of life’s cessation—but commence\n      with that sad, sad instant when, the fever having abandoned you,\n      you sank into a breathless and motionless torpor, and I pressed\n      down your pallid eyelids with the passionate fingers of love.\n\n      _ Monos._ One word first, my Una, in regard to man’s general\r\ncondition at this epoch. You will remember that one or two of the\n      wise among our forefathers—wise in fact, although not in the\n      world’s esteem—had ventured to doubt the propriety of the term\n      “improvement,” as applied to the progress of our civilization.\n      There were periods in each of the five or six centuries\n      immediately preceding our dissolution, when arose some vigorous\n      intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose truth\n      appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly\r\nobvious—principles which should have taught our race to submit to\n      the guidance of the natural laws, rather than attempt their\n      control. At long intervals some masterminds appeared, looking\n      upon each advance in practical science as a retro-gradation in\n      the true utility. Occasionally the poetic intellect—that\n      intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of\n      all—since those truths which to us were of the most enduring\n      importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in","proof tones to the imagination alone and to the unaided reason\n      bears no weight—occasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a\n      step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the\n      philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the\n      tree of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a\n      distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the\n      infant condition of his soul. And these men—the poets—living and\n      perishing amid the scorn of the “utilitarians”—of rough pedants,\r\nwho arrogated to themselves a title which could have been\n      properly applied only to the scorned—these men, the poets,\n      pondered piningly, yet not unwisely, upon the ancient days when\n      our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keen—days\n      when mirth was a word unknown, so solemnly deep-toned was\n      happiness—holy, august and blissful days, when blue rivers ran\n      undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest solitudes,\n      primæval, odorous, and unexplored.\n\n      Yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule served but to\r\nstrengthen it by opposition. Alas! we had fallen upon the most\n      evil of all our evil days. The great “movement”—that was the cant\n      term—went on: a diseased commotion, moral and physical. Art—the\n      Arts—arose supreme, and, once enthroned, cast chains upon the\n      intellect which had elevated them to power. Man, because he could\n      not but acknowledge the majesty of Nature, fell into childish\n      exultation at his acquired and still-increasing dominion over her\n      elements. Even while he stalked a God in his own fancy, an\r\ninfantine imbecility came over him. As might be supposed from the\n      origin of his disorder, he grew infected with system, and with\n      abstraction. He enwrapped himself in generalities. Among other\n      odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground; and in the\n      face of analogy and of God—in despite of the loud warning voice\n      of the laws of _gradation_ so visibly pervading all things in\n      Earth and Heaven—wild attempts at an omni-prevalent Democracy\n      were made. Yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading","evil—Knowledge. Man could not both know and succumb. Meantime\n      huge smoking cities arose, innumerable. Green leaves shrank\n      before the hot breath of furnaces. The fair face of Nature was\n      deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome disease. And\n      methinks, sweet Una, even our slumbering sense of the forced and\n      of the far-fetched might have arrested us here. But now it\n      appears that we had worked out our own destruction in the\n      perversion of our taste, or rather in the blind neglect of its\r\nculture in the schools. For, in truth, it was at this crisis that\n      taste alone—that faculty which, holding a middle position between\n      the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely have\n      been disregarded—it was now that taste alone could have led us\n      gently back to Beauty, to Nature, and to Life. But alas for the\n      pure contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of Plato! Alas\n      for the μουσικη which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient\n      education for the soul! Alas for him and for it!—since both were\r\nmost desperately needed when both were most entirely forgotten or\n      despised. {*1}\n\n      Pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how\n      truly!—“que tout notre raisonnement se rèduit à céder au\n      sentiment;” and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the\n      natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old\n      ascendancy over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools. But\n      this thing was not to be. Prematurely induced by intemperance of\n      knowledge the old age of the world drew on. This the mass of\r\nmankind saw not, or, living lustily although unhappily, affected\n      not to see. But, for myself, the Earth’s records had taught me to\n      look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization. I had\n      imbibed a prescience of our Fate from comparison of China the\n      simple and enduring, with Assyria the architect, with Egypt the\n      astrologer, with Nubia, more crafty than either, the turbulent\n      mother of all Arts. In history {*2} of these regions I met with a\n      ray from the Future. The individual artificialities of the three","latter were local diseases of the Earth, and in their individual\n      overthrows we had seen local remedies applied; but for the\n      infected world at large I could anticipate no regeneration save\n      in death. That man, as a race, should not become extinct, I saw\n      that he must be “born again.”\n\n      And now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,\n      daily, in dreams. Now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of\n      the days to come, when the Art-scarred surface of the Earth,\r\nhaving undergone that purification {*3} which alone could efface\n      its rectangular obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the\n      verdure and the mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of\n      Paradise, and be rendered at length a fit dwelling-place for\n      man:—for man the Death purged—for man to whose now exalted\n      intellect there should be poison in knowledge no more—for the\n      redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal, but still for\n      the material, man.\n\n      _Una._ Well do I remember these conversations, dear Monos; but\r\nthe epoch of the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we\n      believed, and as the corruption you indicate did surely warrant\n      us in believing. Men lived; and died individually. You yourself\n      sickened, and passed into the grave; and thither your constant\n      Una speedily followed you. And though the century which has since\n      elapsed, and whose conclusion brings us thus together once more,\n      tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience of duration,\n      yet, my Monos, it was a century still.\n\n      _Monos._ Say, rather, a point in the vague infinity.\r\nUnquestionably, it was in the Earth’s dotage that I died. Wearied\n      at heart with anxieties which had their origin in the general\n      turmoil and decay, I succumbed to the fierce fever. After some\n      few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium replete with\n      ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for pain, while\n      I longed but was impotent to undeceive you—after some days there\n      came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless\n      torpor; and this was termed Death by those who stood around me.","Words are vague things. My condition did not deprive me of\n      sentience. It appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the\n      extreme quiescence of him, who, having slumbered long and\n      profoundly, lying motionless and fully prostrate in a midsummer\n      noon, begins to steal slowly back into consciousness, through the\n      mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without being awakened by\n      external disturbances.\n\n      I breathed no longer. The pulses were still. The heart had ceased\n      to beat. Volition had not departed, but was powerless. The senses\r\nwere unusually active, although eccentrically so—assuming often\n      each other’s functions at random. The taste and the smell were\n      inextricably confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and\n      intense. The rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened\n      my lips to the last, affected me with sweet fancies of\n      flowers—fantastic flowers, far more lovely than any of the old\n      Earth, but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us. The\n      eyelids, transparent and bloodless, offered no complete\r\nimpediment to vision. As volition was in abeyance, the balls\n      could not roll in their sockets but all objects within the range\n      of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less\n      distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or\n      into the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than\n      those which struck the front or interior surface. Yet, in the\n      former instance, this effect was so far anomalous that I\n      appreciated it only as sound—sound sweet or discordant as the\n      matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in\r\nshade—curved or angular in outline. The hearing, at the same\n      time, although excited in degree, was not irregular in\n      action—estimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision,\n      not less than of sensibility. Touch had undergone a modification\n      more peculiar. Its impressions were tardily received, but\n      pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the highest\n      physical pleasure. Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon\n      my eyelids, at first only recognised through vision, at length,","long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual\n      delight immeasurable. I say with a sensual delight. All my\n      perceptions were purely sensual. The materials furnished the\n      passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree wrought\n      into shape by the deceased understanding. Of pain there was some\n      little; of pleasure there was much; but of moral pain or pleasure\n      none at all. Thus your wild sobs floated into my ear with all\n      their mournful cadences, and were appreciated in their every\r\nvariation of sad tone; but they were soft musical sounds and no\n      more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the\n      sorrows which gave them birth; while the large and constant tears\n      which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a heart which\n      broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone. And\n      this was in truth the Death of which these bystanders spoke\n      reverently, in low whispers—you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with loud\n      cries.\n\n      They attired me for the coffin—three or four dark figures which\r\nflitted busily to and fro. As these crossed the direct line of my\n      vision they affected me as forms; but upon passing to my side\n      their images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and\n      other dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of wo. You\n      alone, habited in a white robe, passed in all directions\n      musically about me.\n\n      The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed\n      by a vague uneasiness—an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when\n      sad real sounds fall continuously within his ear—low distant\r\nbell-tones, solemn, at long but equal intervals, and mingling\n      with melancholy dreams. Night arrived; and with its shadows a\n      heavy discomfort. It oppressed my limbs with the oppression of\n      some dull weight, and was palpable. There was also a moaning\n      sound, not unlike the distant reverberation of surf, but more\n      continuous, which, beginning with the first twilight, had grown\n      in strength with the darkness. Suddenly lights were brought into\n      the room, and this reverberation became forthwith interrupted","into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound, but less dreary\n      and less distinct. The ponderous oppression was in a great\n      measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp, (for\n      there were many,) there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain\n      of melodious monotone. And when now, dear Una, approaching the\n      bed upon which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side,\n      breathing odor from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my\n      brow, there arose tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with\r\nthe merely physical sensations which circumstances had called\n      forth, a something akin to sentiment itself—a feeling that, half\n      appreciating, half responded to your earnest love and sorrow; but\n      this feeling took no root in the pulseless heart, and seemed\n      indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and faded quickly away,\n      first into extreme quiescence, and then into a purely sensual\n      pleasure as before.\n\n      And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there\n      appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect. In its\r\nexercise I found a wild delight—yet a delight still physical,\n      inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part. Motion in the\n      animal frame had fully ceased. No muscle quivered; no nerve\n      thrilled; no artery throbbed. But there seemed to have sprung up\n      in the brain, that of which no words could convey to the merely\n      human intelligence even an indistinct conception. Let me term it\n      a mental pendulous pulsation. It was the moral embodiment of\n      man’s abstract idea of Time. By the absolute equalization of this\r\nmovement—or of such as this—had the cycles of the firmamental\n      orbs themselves, been adjusted. By its aid I measured the\n      irregularities of the clock upon the mantel, and of the watches\n      of the attendants. Their tickings came sonorously to my ears. The\n      slightest deviations from the true proportion—and these\n      deviations were omni-prevalent—affected me just as violations of\n      abstract truth were wont, on earth, to affect the moral sense.\n      Although no two of the time-pieces in the chamber struck the","individual seconds accurately together, yet I had no difficulty\n      in holding steadily in mind the tones, and the respective\n      momentary errors of each. And this—this keen, perfect,\n      self-existing sentiment of duration—this sentiment existing (as\n      man could not possibly have conceived it to exist) independently\n      of any succession of events—this idea—this sixth sense,\n      upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first obvious and\n      certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of the\n      temporal Eternity.\r\nIt was midnight; and you still sat by my side. All others had\n      departed from the chamber of Death. They had deposited me in the\n      coffin. The lamps burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the\n      tremulousness of the monotonous strains. But, suddenly these\n      strains diminished in distinctness and in volume. Finally they\n      ceased. The perfume in my nostrils died away. Forms affected my\n      vision no longer. The oppression of the Darkness uplifted itself\n      from my bosom. A dull shock like that of electricity pervaded my\r\nframe, and was followed by total loss of the idea of contact. All\n      of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole consciousness\n      of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of duration. The\n      mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the\n      deadly Decay.\n\n      Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and\n      the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a\n      lethargic intuition. I appreciated the direful change now in\n      operation upon the flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware\r\nof the bodily presence of one who leans over him, so, sweet Una,\n      I still dully felt that you sat by my side. So, too, when the\n      noon of the second day came, I was not unconscious of those\n      movements which displaced you from my side, which confined me\n      within the coffin, which deposited me within the hearse, which\n      bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which heaped\n      heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness\n      and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.","And here, in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose,\n      there rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul watched\n      narrowly each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record\n      of its flight—without effort and without object.\n\n      A year passed. The consciousness of being had grown hourly more\n      indistinct, and that of mere locality had, in great measure,\n      usurped its position. The idea of entity was becoming merged in\n      that of place. The narrow space immediately surrounding what had\r\nbeen the body, was now growing to be the body itself. At length,\n      as often happens to the sleeper (by sleep and its world alone is\n      Death imaged)—at length, as sometimes happened on Earth to the\n      deep slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into\n      awaking, yet left him half enveloped in dreams—so to me, in the\n      strict embrace of the Shadow came that light which alone might\n      have had power to startle—the light of enduring Love. Men toiled\n      at the grave in which I lay darkling. They upthrew the damp\r\nearth. Upon my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of\n      Una.\n\n      And now again all was void. That nebulous light had been\n      extinguished. That feeble thrill had vibrated itself into\n      quiescence. Many lustra had supervened. Dust had returned to\n      dust. The worm had food no more. The sense of being had at length\n      utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead—instead of all\n      things—dominant and perpetual—the autocrats Place and Time. For\n      that which was not—for that which had no form—for that which had\r\nno thought—for that which had no sentience—for that which was\n      soulless, yet of which matter formed no portion—for all this\n      nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the grave was still a\n      home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CONVERSATION OF EIROS AND CHARMION\n\n\nΠυρ σοι προσοισω.\n     I will bring fire to thee.\n                    —EURIPIDES—_Androm._\n\n      EIROS.\n      Why do you call me Eiros?\n\n      CHARMION.\n      So henceforward will you always be called.

I\n      rejoice to see you looking life-like and rational. The film of\n      the shadow has already passed from off your eyes. Be of heart and\n      fear nothing.

I am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that\n      stupendous event which threw you among us. Tell me of it. Let us\r\nconverse of familiar things, in the old familiar language of the\n      world which has so fearfully perished.\n\n      EIROS.\n      Most fearfully, fearfully!—this is indeed no dream.\n\n      CHARMION.\n      Dreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Eiros?\n\n      EIROS.\n      Mourned, Charmion?—oh deeply. To that last hour of all, there\n      hung a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your\n      household.\n\n      CHARMION.\n      And that last hour—speak of it. Remember that, beyond the naked","fact of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing. When, coming out\n      from among mankind, I passed into Night through the Grave—at that\n      period, if I remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you\n      was utterly unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew little of the\n      speculative philosophy of the day.\n\n      EIROS.\n      The individual calamity was as you say entirely unanticipated;\n      but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion\n      with astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even\r\nwhen you left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in\n      the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of\n      all things by fire, as having reference to the orb of the earth\n      alone. But in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin,\n      speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical\n      knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of\n      flame. The very moderate density of these bodies had been well\n      established. They had been observed to pass among the satellites\r\nof Jupiter, without bringing about any sensible alteration either\n      in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We had\n      long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable\n      tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our\n      substantial globe, even in the event of contact. But contact was\n      not in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets\n      were accurately known. That among them we should look for the\n      agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many\r\nyears considered an inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild\n      fancies had been, of late days, strangely rife among mankind;\n      and, although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual\n      apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement by astronomers of a\n      new comet, yet this announcement was generally received with I\n      know not what of agitation and mistrust.\n\n      The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and\n      it was at once conceded by all observers, that its path, at\n      perihelion, would bring it into very close proximity with the","earth. There were two or three astronomers, of secondary note,\n      who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable. I cannot\n      very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the\n      people. For a few short days they would not believe an assertion\n      which their intellect so long employed among worldly\n      considerations could not in any manner grasp. But the truth of a\n      vitally important fact soon makes its way into the understanding\n      of even the most stolid. Finally, all men saw that astronomical\r\nknowledge lied not, and they awaited the comet. Its approach was\n      not, at first, seemingly rapid; nor was its appearance of very\n      unusual character. It was of a dull red, and had little\n      perceptible train. For seven or eight days we saw no material\n      increase in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration\n      in its color. Meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were\n      discarded and all interests absorbed in a growing discussion,\n      instituted by the philosophic, in respect to the cometary nature.\r\nEven the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to\n      such considerations. The learned now gave their intellect—their\n      soul—to no such points as the allaying of fear, or to the\n      sustenance of loved theory. They sought—they panted for right\n      views. They groaned for perfected knowledge. Truth arose in the\n      purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise bowed\n      down and adored.\n\n      That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would\n      result from the apprehended contact, was an opinion which hourly\r\nlost ground among the wise; and the wise were now freely\n      permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd. It was\n      demonstrated, that the density of the comet’s nucleus was far\n      less than that of our rarest gas; and the harmless passage of a\n      similar visitor among the satellites of Jupiter was a point\n      strongly insisted upon, and which served greatly to allay terror.\n      Theologists with an earnestness fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the\n      biblical prophecies, and expounded them to the people with a","directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been\n      known. That the final destruction of the earth must be brought\n      about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that\n      enforced every where conviction; and that the comets were of no\n      fiery nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved\n      all, in a great measure, from the apprehension of the great\n      calamity foretold. It is noticeable that the popular prejudices\n      and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and wars—errors which\r\nwere wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet—were now\n      altogether unknown. As if by some sudden convulsive exertion,\n      reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne. The\n      feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive interest.\n\n      What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of\n      elaborate question. The learned spoke of slight geological\n      disturbances, of probable alterations in climate, and\n      consequently in vegetation, of possible magnetic and electric\n      influences. Many held that no visible or perceptible effect would\r\nin any manner be produced. While such discussions were going on,\n      their subject gradually approached, growing larger in apparent\n      diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. Mankind grew paler as\n      it came. All human operations were suspended.\n\n      There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when\n      the comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any\n      previously recorded visitation. The people now, dismissing any\n      lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all\r\nthe certainty of evil. The chimerical aspect of their terror was\n      gone. The hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently\n      within their bosoms. A very few days sufficed, however, to merge\n      even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable We could no\n      longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts. Its\n      historical attributes had disappeared. It oppressed us with a\n      hideous novelty of emotion. We saw it not as an astronomical\n      phenomenon in the heavens, but as an incubus upon our hearts, and","a shadow upon our brains. It had taken, with inconceivable\n      rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame,\n      extending from horizon to horizon.\n\n      Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear\n      that we were already within the influence of the comet; yet we\n      lived. We even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity\n      of mind. The exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was\n      apparent; for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through\n      it. Meantime, our vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we\r\ngained faith, from this predicted circumstance, in the foresight\n      of the wise. A wild luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown\n      before, burst out upon every vegetable thing.\n\n      Yet another day—and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was\n      now evident that its nucleus would first reach us. A wild change\n      had come over all men; and the first sense of pain was the wild\n      signal for general lamentation and horror. This first sense of\n      pain lay in a rigorous constriction of the breast and lungs, and\r\nan insufferable dryness of the skin. It could not be denied that\n      our atmosphere was radically affected; the conformation of this\n      atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be\n      subjected, were now the topics of discussion. The result of\n      investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror\n      through the universal heart of man.\n\n      It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a\n      compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of\n      twenty-one measures of oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen in\r\nevery one hundred of the atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the\n      principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely\n      necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most\n      powerful and energetic agent in nature. Nitrogen, on the\n      contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life or\n      flame. An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been\n      ascertained in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we\n      had latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of","the idea, which had engendered awe. What would be the result of a\n      total extraction of the nitrogen? A combustion irresistible,\n      all-devouring, omni-prevalent, immediate;—the entire fulfilment,\n      in all their minute and terrible details, of the fiery and\n      horror-inspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy\n      Book.\n\n      Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of\n      mankind? That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired\n      us with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In\r\nits impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the\n      consummation of Fate. Meantime a day again passed—bearing away\n      with it the last shadow of Hope. We gasped in the rapid\n      modification of the air. The red blood bounded tumultuously\n      through its strict channels. A furious delirium possessed all\n      men; and, with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening\n      heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus of the\n      destroyer was now upon us; even here in Aidenn, I shudder while I\r\nspeak. Let me be brief—brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a\n      moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and\n      penetrating all things. Then—let us bow down, Charmion, before\n      the excessive majesty of the great God!—then, there came a\n      shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth itself of HIM;\n      while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed,\n      burst at once into a species of intense flame, for whose\n      surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels in the\r\nhigh Heaven of pure knowledge have no name. Thus ended all.\n\n\n\n\nSHADOW—A PARABLE\n\n\nYea, though I walk through the valley of the _Shadow._\n                    —_Psalm of David_.\n\n      Ye who read are still among the living; but I who write shall\n      have long since gone my way into the region of shadows. For\n      indeed strange things shall happen, and secret things be known,\n      and many centuries shall pass away, ere these memorials be seen\n      of men. And, when seen, there will be some to disbelieve, and\n      some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in","the characters here graven with a stylus of iron.\n\n      The year had been a year of terror, and of feelings more intense\n      than terror for which there is no name upon the earth. For many\n      prodigies and signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea\n      and land, the black wings of the Pestilence were spread abroad.\n      To those, nevertheless, cunning in the stars, it was not unknown\n      that the heavens wore an aspect of ill; and to me, the Greek\n      Oinos, among others, it was evident that now had arrived the\r\nalternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth year when, at\n      the entrance of Aries, the planet Jupiter is conjoined with the\n      red ring of the terrible Saturnus. The peculiar spirit of the\n      skies, if I mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only\n      in the physical orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations,\n      and meditations of mankind.\n\n      Over some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a\n      noble hall, in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a\n      company of seven. And to our chamber there was no entrance save\r\nby a lofty door of brass: and the door was fashioned by the\n      artisan Corinnos, and, being of rare workmanship, was fastened\n      from within. Black draperies, likewise, in the gloomy room, shut\n      out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and the peopleless\n      streets—but the boding and the memory of Evil, they would not be\n      so excluded. There were things around us and about of which I can\n      render no distinct account—things material and\n      spiritual—heaviness in the atmosphere—a sense of\r\nsuffocation—anxiety—and, above all, that terrible state of\n      existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly\n      living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of thought lie\n      dormant. A dead weight hung upon us. It hung upon our limbs—upon\n      the household furniture—upon the goblets from which we drank; and\n      all things were depressed, and borne down thereby—all things save\n      only the flames of the seven lamps which illumined our revel.\n      Uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus","remained burning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror\n      which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which\n      we sat, each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own\n      countenance, and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his\n      companions. Yet we laughed and were merry in our proper way—which\n      was hysterical; and sang the songs of Anacreon—which are madness;\n      and drank deeply—although the purple wine reminded us of blood.\n      For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of\r\nyoung Zoilus. Dead, and at full length he lay, enshrouded; the\n      genius and the demon of the scene. Alas! he bore no portion in\n      our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the plague,\n      and his eyes, in which Death had but half extinguished the fire\n      of the pestilence, seemed to take such interest in our merriment\n      as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to\n      die. But although I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed\n      were upon me, still I forced myself not to perceive the\r\nbitterness of their expression, and gazing down steadily into the\n      depths of the ebony mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice\n      the songs of the son of Teios. But gradually my songs they\n      ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar off among the sable\n      draperies of the chamber, became weak, and undistinguishable, and\n      so faded away. And lo! from among those sable draperies where the\n      sounds of the song departed, there came forth a dark and\n      undefined shadow—a shadow such as the moon, when low in heaven,\r\nmight fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow\n      neither of man nor of God, nor of any familiar thing. And\n      quivering awhile among the draperies of the room, it at length\n      rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass. But\n      the shadow was vague, and formless, and indefinite, and was the\n      shadow neither of man nor of God—neither God of Greece, nor God\n      of Chaldaea, nor any Egyptian God. And the shadow rested upon the\n      brazen doorway, and under the arch of the entablature of the","door, and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there became\n      stationary and remained. And the door whereupon the shadow rested\n      was, if I remember aright, over against the feet of the young\n      Zoilus enshrouded. But we, the seven there assembled, having seen\n      the shadow as it came out from among the draperies, dared not\n      steadily behold it, but cast down our eyes, and gazed continually\n      into the depths of the mirror of ebony. And at length I, Oinos,\n      speaking some low words, demanded of the shadow its dwelling and\r\nits appellation. And the shadow answered, “I am SHADOW, and my\n      dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and hard by those\n      dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foul Charonian\n      canal.” And then did we, the seven, start from our seats in\n      horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast, for the\n      tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one\n      being, but of a multitude of beings, and, varying in their\n      cadences from syllable to syllable fell duskly upon our ears in\r\nthe well-remembered and familiar accents of many thousand\n      departed friends.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, Volume 4, by Edgar Allan Poe\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WORKS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE, VOL. 4 ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2150-0.txt or 2150-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/5/2150/\n\nProduced by David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.

that the finest place in the\r\n      world isor alas wasthe dutch borough of\r\n      vondervotteimittiss yet as it lies some distance from any of the\r\n      main roads being in a somewhat outoftheway situation there\r\n      are perhaps very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit\r\n      for the benefit of those who have not therefore it will be only\r\n      proper that i should enter into some account of it and this is\r\n      indeed the more necessary as with the hope of enlisting public\r\n      sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants i design here to give a\r\n      history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred\r\n      within its limits no one who knows me will doubt that the duty\r\n      thus selfimposed will be executed to the best of my ability\r\n      with all that rigid impartiality all that cautious examination\r\n      into facts and diligent collation of authorities which should\r\n      ever distinguish him who aspires to the title of historian\r\n\r\n      by the united aid of medals manuscripts and inscriptions i am\r\n      enabled to say positively that the borough of\r\n      vondervotteimittiss has existed from its origin in precisely\r\n      the same condition which it at present preserves of the date of\r\n      this origin however i grieve that i can only speak with that\r\n      species of indefinite definiteness which mathematicians are at\r\n      times forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae the\r\n      date i may thus say in regard to the remoteness of its\r\n      antiquity cannot be less than any assignable quantity\r\n      whatsoever\r\n\r\n      touching the derivation of the name vondervotteimittiss i\r\n      confess myself with sorrow equally at fault among a multitude\r\n      of opinions upon this delicate pointsome acute some learned\r\n      some sufficiently the reversei am able to select nothing which\r\n      ought to be considered satisfactory perhaps the idea of\r\n      grogswiggnearly coincident with that of kroutaplentteyis to be\r\n      cautiously preferredit runsvondervotteimittisvonder lege\r\n      dondervotteimittis quasi und bleitzizbleitziz obsolpro\r\n      blitzen this derivative to say the truth is still\r\n      countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the\r\n      summit of the steeple of the house of the towncouncil i do not\r\n      choose however to commit myself on a theme of such importance\r\n      and must refer the reader desirous of information to the\r\n      oratiunculae de rebus praeterveteris of dundergutz see\r\n      also blunderbuzzard de derivationibus pp  to  folio\r\n      gothic edit red and black character catchword and no cypher\r\n      wherein consult also marginal notes in the autograph of\r\n      stuffundpuff with the subcommentaries of gruntundguzzell\r\n\r\n      notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the\r\n      foundation of vondervotteimittis and the derivation of its name\r\n      there can be no doubt as i said before that it has always\r\n      existed as we find it at this epoch the oldest man in the\r\n      borough can remember not the slightest difference in the\r\n      appearance of any portion of it and indeed the very suggestion\r\n      of such a possibility is considered an insult the site of the\r\n      village is in a perfectly circular valley about a quarter of a\r\n      mile in circumference and entirely surrounded by gentle hills\r\n      over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass for\r\n      this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe\r\n      there is anything at all on the other side\r\n\r\n      round the skirts of the valley which is quite level and paved\r\n      throughout with flat tiles extends a continuous row of sixty\r\n      little houses these having their backs on the hills must look\r\n      of course to the centre of the plain which is just sixty yards\r\n      from the front door of each dwelling every house has a small\r\n      garden before it with a circular path a sundial and\r\n      twentyfour cabbages the buildings themselves are so precisely\r\n      alike that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other\r\n      owing to the vast antiquity the style of architecture is\r\n      somewhat odd but it is not for that reason the less strikingly\r\n      picturesque they are fashioned of hardburned little bricks\r\n      red with black ends so that the walls look like a chessboard\r\n      upon a great scale the gables are turned to the front and there\r\n      are cornices as big as all the rest of the house over the eaves\r\n      and over the main doors the windows are narrow and deep with\r\n      very tiny panes and a great deal of sash on the roof is a vast\r\n      quantity of tiles with long curly ears the woodwork throughout\r\n      is of a dark hue and there is much carving about it with but a\r\n      trifling variety of pattern for time out of mind the carvers of\r\n      vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two\r\n      objectsa timepiece and a cabbage but these they do exceedingly\r\n      well and intersperse them with singular ingenuity wherever\r\n      they find room for the chisel\r\n\r\n      the dwellings are as much alike inside as out and the furniture\r\n      is all upon one plan the floors are of square tiles the chairs\r\n      and tables of blacklooking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy\r\n      feet the mantelpieces are wide and high and have not only\r\n      timepieces and cabbages sculptured over the front but a real\r\n      timepiece which makes a prodigious ticking on the top in the\r\n      middle with a flowerpot containing a cabbage standing on each\r\n      extremity by way of outrider between each cabbage and the\r\n      timepiece again is a little china man having a large stomach\r\n      with a great round hole in it through which is seen the\r\n      dialplate of a watch\r\n\r\n      the fireplaces are large and deep with fierce crookedlooking\r\n      firedogs there is constantly a rousing fire and a huge pot\r\n      over it full of sauerkraut and pork to which the good woman of\r\n      the house is always busy in attending she is a little fat old\r\n      lady with blue eyes and a red face and wears a huge cap like a\r\n      sugarloaf ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons her dress\r\n      is of orangecolored linseywoolsey made very full behind and\r\n      very short in the waistand indeed very short in other respects\r\n      not reaching below the middle of her leg this is somewhat thick\r\n      and so are her ankles but she has a fine pair of green stockings\r\n      to cover them her shoesof pink leatherare fastened each with a\r\n      bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage in\r\n      her left hand she has a little heavy dutch watch in her right\r\n      she wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork by her side there\r\n      stands a fat tabby cat with a gilt toyrepeater tied to its\r\n      tail which the boys have there fastened by way of a quiz\r\n\r\n      the boys themselves are all three of them in the garden\r\n      attending the pig they are each two feet in height they have\r\n      threecornered cocked hats purple waistcoats reaching down to\r\n      their thighs buckskin kneebreeches red stockings heavy shoes\r\n      with big silver buckles long surtout coats with large buttons of\r\n      motherofpearl each too has a pipe in his mouth and a little\r\n      dumpy watch in his right hand he takes a puff and a look and\r\n      then a look and a puff the pigwhich is corpulent and lazyis\r\n      occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the\r\n      cabbages and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater\r\n      which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him\r\n      look as handsome as the cat\r\n\r\n      right at the front door in a highbacked leatherbottomed armed\r\n      chair with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables is\r\n      seated the old man of the house himself he is an exceedingly\r\n      puffy little old gentleman with big circular eyes and a huge\r\n      double chin his dress resembles that of the boysand i need say\r\n      nothing farther about it all the difference is that his pipe is\r\n      somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke like\r\n      them he has a watch but he carries his watch in his pocket to\r\n      say the truth he has something of more importance than a watch\r\n      to attend toand what that is i shall presently explain he sits\r\n      with his right leg upon his left knee wears a grave countenance\r\n      and always keeps one of his eyes at least resolutely bent upon\r\n      a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain\r\n\r\n      this object is situated in the steeple of the house of the town\r\n      council the town council are all very little round oily\r\n      intelligent men with big saucer eyes and fat double chins and\r\n      have their coats much longer and their shoebuckles much bigger\r\n      than the ordinary inhabitants of vondervotteimittiss since my\r\n      sojourn in the borough they have had several special meetings\r\n      and have adopted these three important resolutions\r\n\r\n      that it is wrong to alter the good old course of things\r\n\r\n      that there is nothing tolerable out of vondervotteimittiss\r\n      and\r\n\r\n      that we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages\r\n\r\n      above the sessionroom of the council is the steeple and in the\r\n      steeple is the belfry where exists and has existed time out of\r\n      mind the pride and wonder of the villagethe great clock of the\r\n      borough of vondervotteimittiss and this is the object to which\r\n      the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the\r\n      leatherbottomed armchairs\r\n\r\n      the great clock has seven facesone in each of the seven sides of\r\n      the steepleso that it can be readily seen from all quarters its\r\n      faces are large and white and its hands heavy and black there\r\n      is a belfryman whose sole duty is to attend to it but this duty\r\n      is the most perfect of sinecuresfor the clock of\r\n      vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the\r\n      matter with it until lately the bare supposition of such a\r\n      thing was considered heretical from the remotest period of\r\n      antiquity to which the archives have reference the hours have\r\n      been regularly struck by the big bell and indeed the case was\r\n      just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the\r\n      borough never was such a place for keeping the true time when\r\n      the large clapper thought proper to say twelve oclock all its\r\n      obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously and\r\n      responded like a very echo in short the good burghers were fond\r\n      of their sauerkraut but then they were proud of their clocks\r\n\r\n      all people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less\r\n      respect and as the belfryman of vondervotteimittiss has the\r\n      most perfect of sinecures he is the most perfectly respected of\r\n      any man in the world he is the chief dignitary of the borough\r\n      and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence\r\n      his coattail is very far longerhis pipe his shoebuckles his\r\n      eyes and his stomach very far biggerthan those of any other\r\n      old gentleman in the village and as to his chin it is not only\r\n      double but triple\r\n\r\n      i have thus painted the happy estate of vondervotteimittiss\r\n      alas that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse\r\n\r\n      there has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants that\r\n      no good can come from over the hills and it really seemed that\r\n      the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy it\r\n      wanted five minutes of noon on the day before yesterday when\r\n      there appeared a very oddlooking object on the summit of the\r\n      ridge of the eastward such an occurrence of course attracted\r\n      universal attention and every little old gentleman who sat in a\r\n      leatherbottomed armchair turned one of his eyes with a stare of\r\n      dismay upon the phenomenon still keeping the other upon the\r\n      clock in the steeple\r\n\r\n      by the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon the droll\r\n      object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive\r\n      foreignlooking young man he descended the hills at a great\r\n      rate so that every body had soon a good look at him he was\r\n      really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen\r\n      in vondervotteimittiss his countenance was of a dark\r\n      snuffcolor and he had a long hooked nose pea eyes a wide\r\n      mouth and an excellent set of teeth which latter he seemed\r\n      anxious of displaying as he was grinning from ear to ear what\r\n      with mustachios and whiskers there was none of the rest of his\r\n      face to be seen his head was uncovered and his hair neatly done\r\n      up in papillotes his dress was a tightfitting swallowtailed\r\n      black coat from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of\r\n      white handkerchief black kerseymere kneebreeches black\r\n      stockings and stumpylooking pumps with huge bunches of black\r\n      satin ribbon for bows under one arm he carried a huge\r\n      chapeaudebras and under the other a fiddle nearly five times\r\n      as big as himself in his left hand was a gold snuffbox from\r\n      which as he capered down the hill cutting all manner of\r\n      fantastic steps he took snuff incessantly with an air of the\r\n      greatest possible selfsatisfaction god bless mehere was a\r\n      sight for the honest burghers of vondervotteimittiss\r\n\r\n      to speak plainly the fellow had in spite of his grinning an\r\n      audacious and sinister kind of face and as he curvetted right\r\n      into the village the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited\r\n      no little suspicion and many a burgher who beheld him that day\r\n      would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric\r\n      handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his\r\n      swallowtailed coat but what mainly occasioned a righteous\r\n      indignation was that the scoundrelly popinjay while he cut a\r\n      fandango here and a whirligig there did not seem to have the\r\n      remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his\r\n      steps\r\n\r\n      the good people of the borough had scarcely a chance however to\r\n      get their eyes thoroughly open when just as it wanted half a\r\n      minute of noon the rascal bounced as i say right into the\r\n      midst of them gave a chassez here and a balancez there and\r\n      then after a pirouette and a pasdezephyr pigeonwinged\r\n      himself right up into the belfry of the house of the town\r\n      council where the wonderstricken belfryman sat smoking in a\r\n      state of dignity and dismay but the little chap seized him at\r\n      once by the nose gave it a swing and a pull clapped the big\r\n      chapeaudebras upon his head knocked it down over his eyes\r\n      and mouth and then lifting up the big fiddle beat him with it\r\n      so long and so soundly that what with the belfryman being so\r\n      fat and the fiddle being so hollow you would have sworn that\r\n      there was a regiment of doublebass drummers all beating the\r\n      devils tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of\r\n      vondervotteimittiss\r\n\r\n      there is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this\r\n      unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants but for\r\n      the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon\r\n      the bell was about to strike and it was a matter of absolute and\r\n      preeminent necessity that every body should look well at his\r\n      watch it was evident however that just at this moment the\r\n      fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business\r\n      to do with the clock but as it now began to strike nobody had\r\n      any time to attend to his manœuvres for they had all to count\r\n      the strokes of the bell as it sounded\r\n\r\n      one said the clock\r\n\r\n      von echoed every little old gentleman in every\r\n      leatherbottomed armchair in vondervotteimittiss von said\r\n      his watch also von said the watch of his vrow and von\r\n      said the watches of the boys and the little gilt repeaters on\r\n      the tails of the cat and pig\r\n\r\n      two continued the big bell and\r\n\r\n      doo repeated all the repeaters\r\n\r\n      three four five six seven eight nine ten said the bell\r\n\r\n      dree vour fibe sax seben aight noin den answered the\r\n      others\r\n\r\n      eleven said the big one\r\n\r\n      eleben assented the little ones\r\n\r\n      twelve said the bell\r\n\r\n      dvelf they replied perfectly satisfied and dropping their\r\n      voices\r\n\r\n      und dvelf it is said all the little old gentlemen putting up\r\n      their watches but the big bell had not done with them yet\r\n\r\n      thirteen said he\r\n\r\n      der teufel gasped the little old gentlemen turning pale\r\n      dropping their pipes and putting down all their right legs from\r\n      over their left knees\r\n\r\n      der teufel groaned they dirteen dirteenmein gott it is\r\n      dirteen oclock\r\n\r\n      why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued all\r\n      vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of\r\n      uproar\r\n\r\n      vot is cumd to mein pelly roared all the boysive been\r\n      ongry for dis hour\r\n\r\n      vot is comd to mein kraut screamed

hourand\r\n      they filled them up again in a great rage and sinking back in\r\n      their armchairs puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the\r\n      whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke\r\n\r\n      meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face and it\r\n      seemed as if old nick himself had taken possession of every thing\r\n      in the shape of a timepiece the clocks carved upon the furniture\r\n      took to dancing as if bewitched while those upon the\r\n      mantelpieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury and\r\n      kept such a continual striking of thirteen and such a frisking\r\n      and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see\r\n      but worse than all neither the cats nor the pigs could put up\r\n      any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to\r\n      their tails and resented it by scampering all over the place\r\n      scratching and poking and squeaking and screeching and\r\n      caterwauling and squalling and flying into the faces and\r\n      running under the petticoats of the people and creating\r\n      altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is\r\n      possible for a reasonable person to conceive and to make matters\r\n      still more distressing the rascally little scapegrace in the\r\n      steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost every now\r\n      and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the\r\n      smoke there he sat in the belfry upon the belfryman who was\r\n      lying flat upon his back in his teeth the villain held the\r\n      bellrope which he kept jerking about with his head raising\r\n      such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it on\r\n      his lap lay the big fiddle at which he was scraping out of all\r\n      time and tune with both hands making a great show the\r\n      nincompoop of playing judy oflannagan and paddy orafferty\r\n\r\n      affairs being thus miserably situated i left the place in\r\n      disgust and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and\r\n      fine kraut let us proceed in a body to the borough and restore\r\n      the ancient order of things in vondervotteimittiss by ejecting\r\n      that little fellow from the steeple\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlionizing\r\n\r\n\r\n      all people went\r\n     upon their ten toes in wild wonderment\r\n                    bishop halls satires\r\n\r\n      i amthat is to say i wasa great man but i am neither the\r\n      author of junius nor the man in the mask for my name i believe\r\n      is robert jones and i was born somewhere in the city of\r\n      fumfudge\r\n\r\n      the first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with\r\n      both hands my mother saw this and called me a geniusmy father\r\n      wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on nosology this i\r\n      mastered before i was breeched\r\n\r\n      i now began to feel my way in the science and soon came to\r\n      understand that provided a man had a nose sufficiently\r\n      conspicuous he might by merely following it arrive at a\r\n      lionship but my attention was not confined to theories alone\r\n      every morning i gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed\r\n      a half dozen of drams\r\n\r\n      when i came of age my father asked me one day if i would step\r\n      with him into his study\r\n\r\n      my son said he when we were seated what is the chief end of\r\n      your existence\r\n\r\n      my father i answered it is the study of nosology\r\n\r\n      and what robert he inquired is nosology\r\n\r\n      sir i said it is the science of noses\r\n\r\n      and can you tell me he demanded what is the meaning of a\r\n      nose\r\n\r\n      a nose my father i replied greatly softened has been\r\n      variously defined by about a thousand different authors here i\r\n      pulled out my watch it is now noon or

grenouille\r\n\r\n      tousand teufel growled the elector of bluddennuff\r\n\r\n      it was not to be borne i grew angry i turned short upon\r\n      bluddennuff\r\n\r\n      sir said i to him you are a baboon\r\n\r\n      sir he replied after a pause donner und blitzen\r\n\r\n      this was all that could be desired we exchanged cards at\r\n      chalkfarm the next morning i shot off his noseand then called\r\n      upon my friends\r\n\r\n      bête said the first\r\n\r\n      fool said the second\r\n\r\n      dolt said the third\r\n\r\n      ass said the fourth\r\n\r\n      ninny

chief end of my existence\r\n\r\n      my son he replied it is still the study of nosology but in\r\n      hitting the elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark\r\n      you have a fine nose it is true but then bluddennuff has none\r\n      you are damned and he has become the hero of the day i grant\r\n      you that in fumfudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to\r\n      the size of his proboscisbut good heavens there is no\r\n      competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nxing a paragrab\r\n\r\n\r\n      as it is well known that the wise men came from the east and\r\n      as mr touchandgo bullethead came from the east it follows\r\n      that mr bullethead was a wise man and if collateral proof of\r\n      the matter be needed here we have itmr b was an editor\r\n      irascibility was his sole foible for in fact the obstinacy of\r\n      which men accused him was anything but his foible since he\r\n      justly considered it his forte it was his strong pointhis\r\n      virtue and it would have required all the logic of a brownson to\r\n      convince him that it was anything else\r\n\r\n      i have shown that touchandgo bullethead was a wise man and\r\n      the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible was when\r\n      abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men the east he\r\n      migrated to the city of alexanderthegreatonopolis or some\r\n      place of a similar title out west\r\n\r\n      i must do him the justice to say however that when he made up\r\n      his mind finally to settle in that town it was under the\r\n      impression that no newspaper and consequently no editor existed\r\n      in that particular section of the country in establishing the\r\n      teapot he expected to have the field all to himself i feel\r\n      confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence\r\n      in alexanderthegreatonopolis had he been aware that in\r\n      alexanderthegreatonopolis there lived a gentleman named john\r\n      smith if i rightly remember who for many years had there\r\n      quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the\r\n      alexanderthegreatonopolis gazette it was solely\r\n      therefore on account of having been misinformed that mr\r\n      bullethead found himself in alex suppose we call it nopolis\r\n      for shortbut as he did find himself there he determined to\r\n      keep up his character for obstfor firmness and remain so\r\n      remain he did and he did more he unpacked his press type\r\n      etc etc rented an office exactly opposite to that of the\r\n      gazette and on the third morning after his arrival issued\r\n      the first number of the alexanthat is to say of the nopolis\r\n      teapotas nearly as i can recollect this was the name of the\r\n      new paper\r\n\r\n      the leading article i must admit was brilliantnot to say\r\n      severe it was especially bitter about things in generaland as\r\n      for the editor of the gazette he was torn all to pieces in\r\n      particular some of bulletheads remarks were really so fiery\r\n      that i have always since that time been forced to look upon\r\n      john smith who is still alive in the light of a salamander i\r\n      cannot pretend to give all the teapots paragraphs verbatim\r\n      but one of them runs thus\r\n\r\n      oh yesoh we perceive oh no doubt the editor over the way\r\n      is a geniuso my oh goodness graciouswhat is this world\r\n      coming to oh tempora oh moses\r\n\r\n      a philippic at once so caustic and so classical alighted like a\r\n      bombshell among the hitherto peaceful citizens of nopolis groups\r\n      of excited individuals gathered at the corners of the streets\r\n      every one awaited with heartfelt anxiety the reply of the\r\n      dignified smith next morning it appeared as follows\r\n\r\n      we quote from the teapot of yesterday the subjoined\r\n      paragraph oh yes oh we perceive oh no doubt oh my oh\r\n      goodness oh tempora oh moses why the fellow is all o that\r\n      accounts for his reasoning in a circle and explains why there is\r\n      neither beginning nor end to him nor to anything he says we\r\n      really do not believe the vagabond can write a word that hasnt\r\n      an o in it wonder if this oing is a habit of his bytheby he\r\n      came away from downeast in a great hurry wonder if he os as\r\n      much there as he does here o it is pitiful\r\n\r\n      the indignation of mr bullethead at these scandalous\r\n      insinuations i shall not attempt to describe on the\r\n      eelskinning principle however he did not seem to be so much\r\n      incensed at the attack upon his integrity as one might have\r\n      imagined it was the sneer at his style that drove him to\r\n      desperation whathe touchandgo bulletheadnot able to write\r\n      a word without an o in it he would soon let the jackanapes see\r\n      that he was mistaken yes he would let him see how much he was\r\n      mistaken the puppy he touchandgo bullethead of\r\n      frogpondium would let mr john smith perceive that he\r\n      bullethead could indite if it so pleased him a whole\r\n      paragraphaye a whole articlein which that contemptible vowel\r\n      should not oncenot even oncemake its appearance but nothat\r\n      would be yielding a point to the said john smith he\r\n      bullethead would make no alteration in his style to suit the\r\n      caprices of any mr smith in christendom perish so vile a\r\n      thought the o forever he would persist in the o he would be as\r\n      owy as owy could be\r\n\r\n      burning with the chivalry of this determination the great\r\n      touchandgo in the next teapot came out merely with this\r\n      simple but resolute paragraph in reference to this unhappy\r\n      affair\r\n\r\n      the editor of the teapot has the honor of advising the editor\r\n      of the gazette that he the teapot will take an opportunity\r\n      in tomorrow mornings paper of convincing him the gazette\r\n      that he the teapot both can and will be his own master as\r\n      regards stylehe the teapot intending to show him the\r\n      gazette the supreme and indeed the withering contempt with\r\n      which the criticism of him the gazette inspires the\r\n      independent bosom of him the teapot by composing for the\r\n      especial gratification  of him the gazette a leading\r\n      article of some extent in which the beautiful vowelthe emblem\r\n      of eternityyet so offensive to the hyperexquisite delicacy of\r\n      him the gazette shall most certainly not be avoided by his\r\n      the gazettes most obedient humble servant the teapot\r\n      so much for buckingham\r\n\r\n      in fulfilment of the awful threat thus darkly intimated rather\r\n      than decidedly enunciated the great bullethead turning a deaf\r\n      ear to all entreaties for copy and simply requesting his\r\n      foreman to go to the dl when he the foreman assured him\r\n      the teapot that it was high time to go to press turning\r\n      a deaf ear to everything i say the great bullethead sat up\r\n      until daybreak consuming the midnight oil and absorbed in the\r\n      composition of the really unparalleled paragraph which follows\r\n\r\n      so ho john how now told you so you know dont crow another\r\n      time before youre out of the woods does your mother know\r\n      youre out oh no noso go home at once now john to your\r\n      odious old woods of concord go home to your woods old owlgo\r\n      you wont oh poh poh john dont do so youve got to go\r\n      you know so go at once and dont go slow for nobody owns you\r\n      here you know oh john john if you dont go youre no\r\n      homono youre only a fowl an owl a cow a sow a doll a\r\n      poll a poor old goodfornothingtonobody log dog hog or\r\n

   you do look told you so you knowbut stop rolling your goose of\r\n      an old poll about so and go and drown your sorrows in a bowl\r\n\r\n      exhausted very naturally by so stupendous an effort the great\r\n      touchandgo could attend to nothing farther that night firmly\r\n      composedly yet with an air of conscious power he handed his ms\r\n      to the devil in waiting and then walking leisurely home\r\n      retired with ineffable dignity to bed\r\n\r\n      meantime the devil to whom the copy was entrusted ran up stairs\r\n      to his case in an unutterable hurry and forthwith made a\r\n      commencement at setting the ms up\r\n\r\n      in the first place of courseas the opening word was sohe\r\n      made a plunge into the capital s hole and came out in triumph\r\n      with a capital s elated by this success he immediately threw\r\n      himself upon the littleo box with a blindfold impetuositybut\r\n      who shall describe his horror when his fingers came up without\r\n      the anticipated letter in their clutch who shall paint his\r\n      astonishment and rage at perceiving as he rubbed his knuckles\r\n      that he had been only thumping them to no purpose against the\r\n      bottom of an empty box not a single littleo was in the littleo\r\n      hole and glancing fearfully at the capitalo partition he\r\n      found that to his extreme terror in a precisely similar\r\n      predicament awestricken his first impulse was to rush to the\r\n      foreman\r\n\r\n      sir said he gasping for breath i cant never set up nothing\r\n      without no os\r\n\r\n      what do you mean by that growled the foreman who was in a\r\n      very ill humor at being kept so late\r\n\r\n      why sir there beant an o in the office neither a big un nor a\r\n      little un\r\n\r\n      whatwhat the dl has become of all that were in the case\r\n\r\n      i dont know sir said the boy but one of them ere gzette\r\n      devils is bin prowling bout here all night and i spect hes\r\n      gone and cabbaged em every one\r\n\r\n      dod rot him i havent a doubt of it replied the foreman\r\n      getting purple with rage but i tell you what you do bob thats\r\n      a good boyyou go over the first chance you get and hook every\r\n      one of their is and dn them their izzards\r\n\r\n      jist so replied bob with a wink and a frownill be into\r\n      em ill let em know a thing or two but in de meantime that\r\n      ere paragrab mus go in tonight you knowelse therell be the\r\n      dl to pay and\r\n\r\n      and not a bit of pitch hot interrupted the foreman with a\r\n      deep sigh and an emphasis on the bit is it a long paragraph\r\n      bob\r\n\r\n      shouldnt call it a wery long paragrab said bob\r\n\r\n      ah well then do the best you can with it we must get to\r\n      press said the foreman who was over head and ears in work\r\n      just stick in some other letter for o nobodys going to read\r\n      the fellows trash anyhow\r\n\r\n      wery well replied bob here goes it and off he hurried to\r\n      his case muttering as he went considdeble vell them ere\r\n      expressions perticcler for a man as doesnt swar so is to\r\n      gouge out all their eyes eh and dn all their gizzards vell\r\n      this heres the chap as is just able for to do it the fact is\r\n      that although bob was but twelve years old and four feet high he\r\n      was equal to any amount of fight in a small way\r\n\r\n      the exigency here described is by no means of rare occurrence in\r\n      printingoffices and i cannot tell how to account for it but\r\n      the fact is indisputable that when the exigency does occur it\r\n      almost always happens that x is adopted as a substitute for the\r\n      letter deficient the true reason perhaps is that x is rather\r\n      the most superabundant letter in the cases or at least was so in\r\n      the old timeslong enough to render the substitution in question\r\n      an habitual thing with printers as for bob he would have\r\n      considered it heretical to employ any other character in a case\r\n      of this kind than the x to which he had been accustomed\r\n\r\n      i shell have to x this ere paragrab said he to himself as he\r\n      read it over in astonishment but its jest about the awfulest\r\n      owy paragrab i ever did see so x it he did unflinchingly and\r\n      to press it went xed\r\n\r\n      next morning the population of nopolis were taken all aback by\r\n      reading in the teapot the following

by this mystical and cabalistical article\r\n      is not to be conceived the first definite idea entertained by\r\n      the populace was that some diabolical treason lay concealed in\r\n      the hieroglyphics and there was a general rush to bulletheads\r\n      residence for the purpose of riding him on a rail but that\r\n      gentleman was nowhere to be found he had vanished no one could\r\n      tell how and not even the ghost of him has ever been seen since\r\n\r\n      unable to discover its legitimate object the popular fury at\r\n      length subsided leaving behind it by way of sediment quite a\r\n      medley of opinion about this unhappy affair\r\n\r\n      one gentleman thought the whole an xellent joke\r\n\r\n      another said that indeed bullethead had shown much xuberance\r\n      of fancy\r\n\r\n      a third admitted him xentric but no more\r\n\r\n      a fourth could only suppose it the yankees design to xpress in\r\n      a general way his

could not be found there was\r\n      some talk about lynching the other one\r\n\r\n      the more common conclusion however was that the affair was\r\n      simply xtraordinary and inxplicable even the town\r\n      mathematician confessed that he could make nothing of so dark a\r\n      problem x everybody knew was an unknown quantity but in this\r\n      case as he properly observed there was

although it was very openly and very\r\n      fearlessly expressed he said that for his part he had no doubt\r\n      about the matter at all that it was a clear case that mr\r\n      bullethead never

so deadly the\r\n      origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an\r\n      ancient prophecya lofty name shall have a fearful fall when as\r\n      the rider over his horse the mortality of metzengerstein shall\r\n      triumph over the immortality of berlifitzing\r\n\r\n      to be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning but\r\n      more trivial causes have given riseand that no long while agoto\r\n      consequences equally eventful besides the estates which were\r\n      contiguous had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs\r\n      of a busy government moreover near neighbors are seldom\r\n      friends and the inhabitants of the castle berlifitzing might\r\n      look from their lofty buttresses into the very windows of the\r\n      palace metzengerstein least of all had the more than feudal\r\n      magnificence thus discovered a tendency to allay the irritable\r\n      feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy berlifitzings what\r\n      wonder then that the words however silly of that prediction\r\n      should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two\r\n      families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of\r\n      hereditary jealousy the prophecy seemed to implyif it implied\r\n      anythinga final triumph on the part of the already more powerful\r\n      house and was of course remembered with the more bitter\r\n      animosity by the weaker and less influential\r\n\r\n      wilhelm count berlifitzing although loftily descended was at\r\n      the epoch of this narrative an infirm and doting old man\r\n      remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal\r\n      antipathy to the family of his rival and so passionate a love of\r\n      horses and of hunting that neither bodily infirmity great age\r\n      nor mental incapacity prevented his daily participation in the\r\n      dangers of the chase\r\n\r\n      frederick baron metzengerstein was on the other hand not yet\r\n      of age his father the minister g died young his mother the\r\n      lady mary followed him quickly after frederick was at that\r\n      time in his fifteenth year in a

years have a far deeper meaning\r\n\r\n      from some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of\r\n      his father the young baron at the decease of the former\r\n      entered immediately upon his vast possessions such estates were\r\n      seldom held before by a nobleman of hungary his castles were\r\n      without number the chief in point of splendor and extent was the\r\n      château metzengerstein the boundary line of his dominions was\r\n      never clearly defined but his principal park embraced a circuit\r\n      of fifty miles\r\n\r\n      upon the succession of a proprietor so young with a character so\r\n      well known to a fortune so unparalleled little speculation was\r\n      afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct and indeed\r\n      for the space of three days the behavior of the heir outheroded\r\n      herod and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most\r\n      enthusiastic admirers shameful

his ownwere thenceforward to prove\r\n      any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty caligula\r\n      on the night of the fourth day the stables of the castle\r\n      berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire and the unanimous\r\n      opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to\r\n      the already hideous list of the barons misdemeanors and\r\n      enormities\r\n\r\n      but during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence the young\r\n      nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation in a vast\r\n      and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of\r\n      metzengerstein the rich although faded tapestry hangings which\r\n      swung gloomily upon the walls represented the shadowy and\r\n      majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors here\r\n      richermined priests and pontifical dignitaries familiarly\r\n      seated with the autocrat and the sovereign put a veto on the\r\n      wishes of a temporal king or restrained with the fiat of papal\r\n      supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the archenemy there the\r\n      dark tall statures of the princes metzengersteintheir muscular\r\n      warcoursers plunging over the carcasses of fallen foesstartled\r\n      the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression and here\r\n      again the voluptuous and swanlike figures of the dames of days\r\n      gone by floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the\r\n      strains of imaginary melody\r\n\r\n      but as the baron listened or affected to listen to the\r\n      gradually increasing uproar in the stables of berlifitzingor\r\n      perhaps pondered upon some more novel some more decided act of\r\n      audacityhis eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an\r\n      enormous and unnaturally colored horse represented in the\r\n      tapestry as belonging to a saracen ancestor of the family of his\r\n      rival the horse itself in the foreground of the design stood\r\n      motionless and statuelikewhile farther back its discomfited\r\n      rider perished by the dagger of a metzengerstein\r\n\r\n      on fredericks lip arose a fiendish expression as he became\r\n      aware of the direction which his glance had without his\r\n      consciousness assumed yet he did not remove it on the\r\n      contrary he could by no means account for the overwhelming\r\n      anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses it\r\n      was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent\r\n      feelings with the certainty of being awake the longer he gazed\r\n      the more absorbing became the spellthe more impossible did it\r\n      appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the\r\n      fascination of that tapestry but the tumult without becoming\r\n      suddenly more violent with a compulsory exertion he diverted his\r\n      attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming\r\n      stables upon the windows of the apartment\r\n\r\n      the action however was but momentary his gaze returned\r\n      mechanically to the wall to his extreme horror and astonishment\r\n      the head of the gigantic steed had in the meantime altered its\r\n      position the neck of the animal before arched as if in\r\n      compassion over the prostrate body of its lord was now\r\n      extended at full length in the direction of the baron the\r\n      eyes before invisible now wore an energetic and human\r\n      expression while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red and\r\n      the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full\r\n      view his gigantic and disgusting teeth\r\n\r\n      stupefied with terror the young nobleman tottered to the door\r\n      as he threw it open a flash of red light streaming far into the\r\n      chamber flung his shadow with a clear outline against the\r\n      quivering tapestry and he shuddered to perceive that shadowas\r\n      he staggered awhile upon the thresholdassuming the exact\r\n      position and precisely filling up the contour of the relentless\r\n      and triumphant murderer of the saracen berlifitzing\r\n\r\n      to lighten the depression of his spirits the baron hurried into\r\n      the open air at the principal gate of the palace he encountered\r\n      three equerries with much difficulty and at the imminent peril\r\n      of their lives they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a\r\n      gigantic and fierycolored horse\r\n\r\n      whose horse where did you get him demanded the youth in a\r\n      querulous and husky tone of voice as he became instantly aware\r\n      that the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very\r\n      counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes\r\n\r\n      he is your own property sire replied one of the equerries\r\n      at least he is claimed by no other owner we caught him flying\r\n      all smoking and foaming with rage from the burning stables of\r\n      the castle berlifitzing supposing him to have belonged to the\r\n      old counts stud of foreign horses we led him back as an estray\r\n      but the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature which is\r\n      strange since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow\r\n      escape from the flames\r\n\r\n      the letters w v b are also branded very distinctly on his\r\n      forehead interrupted a second equerry i supposed them of\r\n      course to be the initials of wilhelm von berlifitzingbut all at\r\n      the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse\r\n\r\n      extremely singular said the young baron with a musing air\r\n      and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words he is\r\n      as you say a remarkable horsea prodigious horse although as\r\n      you very justly observe of a suspicious and untractable\r\n      character let him be mine however he added after a pause\r\n      perhaps a rider like frederick of metzengerstein may tame even\r\n      the devil from the stables of berlifitzing\r\n\r\n      you are mistaken my lord the horse as i think we mentioned\r\n      is not from the stables of the count if such had been the\r\n      case we know our duty better than to bring him into the presence\r\n      of a noble of your family\r\n\r\n      true observed the baron dryly and at that instant a page of\r\n      the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color and\r\n      a precipitate step he whispered into his masters ear an account\r\n      of the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry\r\n      in an apartment which he designated entering at the same time\r\n      into particulars of a minute and circumstantial character but\r\n      from the low tone of voice in which these latter were\r\n      communicated nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of\r\n      the equerries\r\n\r\n      the young frederick during the conference seemed agitated by a\r\n      variety of emotions he soon however recovered his composure\r\n      and an expression of determined malignancy settled upon his\r\n      countenance as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber\r\n      should be immediately locked up and the key placed in his own\r\n      possession\r\n\r\n      have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter\r\n      berlifitzing said one of his vassals to the baron as after\r\n      the departure of the page the huge steed which that nobleman had\r\n      adopted as his own plunged and curvetted with redoubled fury\r\n      down the long avenue which extended from the château to the\r\n      stables of metzengerstein\r\n\r\n      no said the baron turning abruptly toward the speaker dead\r\n      say you\r\n\r\n      it is indeed true my lord and to a noble of your name will\r\n      be i imagine no unwelcome intelligence\r\n\r\n      a rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener how\r\n      died he\r\n\r\n      in his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his\r\n      hunting stud he has himself perished miserably in the flames\r\n\r\n      indeed ejaculated the baron as if slowly and\r\n      deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea\r\n\r\n      indeed repeated the vassal\r\n\r\n      shocking said the youth calmly and turned quietly into the\r\n      château\r\n\r\n      from this date a marked alteration took place in the outward\r\n      demeanor of the dissolute young baron frederick von\r\n      metzengerstein indeed his behavior disappointed every\r\n      expectation and proved little in accordance with the views of\r\n      many a manoeuvering mamma while his habits and manner still\r\n      less than formerly offered any thing congenial with those of the\r\n      neighboring aristocracy he was never to be seen beyond the\r\n      limits of his own domain and in this wide and social world was\r\n      utterly companionlessunless indeed that unnatural impetuous\r\n      and fierycolored horse which he henceforward continually\r\n      bestrode had any mysterious right to the title of his friend\r\n\r\n      numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long\r\n      time however periodically came in will the baron honor our\r\n      festivals with his presence will the baron join us in a\r\n      hunting of the boarmetzengerstein does not hunt\r\n      metzengerstein will not attend were the haughty and laconic\r\n      answers\r\n\r\n      these repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious\r\n      nobility such invitations became less cordialless frequentin\r\n      time they ceased altogether the widow of the unfortunate count\r\n      berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope that the baron\r\n      might be at home when he did not wish to be at home since he\r\n      disdained the company of his equals and ride when he did not\r\n      wish to ride since he preferred the society of a horse this to\r\n      be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique and\r\n      merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to\r\n      become when we desire to be unusually energetic\r\n\r\n      the charitable nevertheless attributed the alteration in the\r\n      conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for\r\n      the untimely loss of his parentsforgetting however his\r\n      atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period\r\n      immediately succeeding that bereavement some there were indeed\r\n      who suggested a too haughty idea of selfconsequence and dignity\r\n      others again among them may be mentioned the family physician\r\n      did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy and hereditary\r\n      illhealth while dark hints of a more equivocal nature were\r\n      current among the multitude\r\n\r\n      indeed the barons perverse attachment to his latelyacquired\r\n      chargeran attachment which seemed to attain new strength from\r\n      every fresh example of the animals ferocious and demonlike\r\n      propensitiesat length became in the eyes of all reasonable men\r\n      a hideous and unnatural fervor in the glare of noonat the dead\r\n      hour of nightin sickness or in healthin calm or in tempestthe\r\n      young metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that\r\n      colossal horse whose intractable audacities so well accorded\r\n      with his own spirit\r\n\r\n      there were circumstances moreover which coupled with late\r\n      events gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania\r\n      of the rider and to the capabilities of the steed the space\r\n      passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured and\r\n      was found to exceed by an astounding difference the wildest\r\n      expectations of the most imaginative the baron besides had no\r\n      particular name for the animal although all the rest in his\r\n      collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations his\r\n      stable too was appointed at a distance from the rest and with\r\n      regard to grooming and other necessary offices none but the\r\n      owner in person had ventured to officiate or even to enter the\r\n      enclosure of that particular stall it was also to be observed\r\n      that although the three grooms who had caught the steed as he\r\n      fled from the conflagration at berlifitzing had succeeded in\r\n      arresting his course by means of a chainbridle and nooseyet no\r\n      one of the three could with any certainty affirm that he had\r\n      during that dangerous struggle or at any period thereafter\r\n      actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast instances of\r\n      peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and\r\n      highspirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting\r\n      unreasonable attentionespecially among men who daily trained to\r\n      the labors of the chase might appear well acquainted with the\r\n      sagacity of a horsebut there were certain circumstances which\r\n      intruded themselves per force upon the most skeptical and\r\n      phlegmatic and it is said there were times when the animal\r\n      caused the gaping crowd who stood around to recoil in horror from\r\n      the deep and impressive meaning of his terrible stamptimes when\r\n      the young metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away from the\r\n      rapid and searching expression of his earnest and humanlooking\r\n      eye\r\n\r\n      among all the retinue of the baron however none were found to\r\n      doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on\r\n      the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his\r\n      horse at least none but an insignificant and misshapen little\r\n      page whose deformities were in everybodys way and whose\r\n      opinions were of the least possible importance heif his ideas\r\n      are worth mentioning at allhad the effrontery to assert that his\r\n      master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and\r\n      almost imperceptible shudder and that upon his return from\r\n      every longcontinued and habitual ride an expression of\r\n      triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance\r\n\r\n      one tempestuous night metzengerstein awaking from a heavy\r\n      slumber descended like a maniac from his chamber and mounting\r\n      in hot haste bounded away into the mazes of the forest an\r\n      occurrence so common attracted no particular attention but his\r\n      return was looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his\r\n      domestics when after some hours absence the stupendous and\r\n      magnificent battlements of the chateau metzengerstein were\r\n      discovered crackling and rocking to their very foundation under\r\n      the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire\r\n\r\n      as the flames when first seen had already made so terrible a\r\n      progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building\r\n      were evidently futile the astonished neighborhood stood idly\r\n      around in silent and pathetic wonder but a new and fearful\r\n      object soon rivetted the attention of the multitude and proved\r\n      how much more intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings\r\n      of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony than that brought\r\n      about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate matter\r\n\r\n      up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the\r\n      main entrance of the château metzengerstein a steed bearing an\r\n      unbonneted and disordered rider was seen leaping with an\r\n      impetuosity which outstripped the very demon of the tempest\r\n\r\n      the career of the horseman was indisputably on his own part\r\n      uncontrollable the agony of his countenance the convulsive\r\n      struggle of his frame gave evidence of superhuman exertion but\r\n      no sound save a solitary shriek escaped from his lacerated\r\n      lips which were bitten through and through in the intensity of\r\n      terror one instant and the clattering of hoofs resounded\r\n      sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the\r\n      shrieking of the windsanother and clearing at a single plunge\r\n      the gateway and the moat the steed bounded far up the tottering\r\n      staircases of the palace and with its rider disappeared amid\r\n      the whirlwind of chaotic fire\r\n\r\n      the fury of the tempest immediately died away and a dead calm\r\n      sullenly succeeded a white flame still enveloped the building\r\n      like a shroud and streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere\r\n      shot forth a glare of preternatural light while a cloud of smoke\r\n      settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal\r\n      figure ofa horse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe system of doctor tarr and professor fether\r\n\r\n\r\n      during the autumn of  while on a tour through the extreme\r\n      southern provinces of france my route led me within a few miles\r\n      of a certain maison de santé or private madhouse about which\r\n      i had heard much in paris from my medical friends as i had\r\n      never visited a place of the kind i thought the opportunity too\r\n      good to be lost and so proposed to my travelling companion a\r\n      gentleman with whom i had made casual acquaintance a few days\r\n      before that we should turn aside for an hour or so and look\r\n      through the establishment to this he objectedpleading haste in\r\n      the first place and in the second a very usual horror at the\r\n      sight of a lunatic he begged me however not to let any mere\r\n      courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my\r\n      curiosity and said that he would ride on leisurely so that i\r\n      might overtake him during the day or at all events during the\r\n      next as he bade me goodbye i bethought me that there might be\r\n      some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises and\r\n      mentioned my fears on this point he replied that in fact\r\n      unless i had personal knowledge of the superintendent monsieur\r\n      maillard or some credential in the way of a letter a difficulty\r\n      might be found to exist as the regulations of these private\r\n      madhouses were more rigid than the public hospital laws for\r\n      himself he added he had some years since made the\r\n      acquaintance of maillard and would so far assist me as to ride\r\n      up to the door and introduce me although his feelings on the\r\n      subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house\r\n\r\n      i thanked him and turning from the main road we entered a\r\n      grassgrown bypath which in half an hour nearly lost itself\r\n      in a dense forest clothing the base of a mountain through this\r\n      dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles when the maison de\r\n      santé came in view it was a fantastic château much\r\n      dilapidated and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and\r\n      neglect its aspect inspired me with absolute dread and\r\n      checking my horse i half resolved to turn back i soon however\r\n      grew ashamed of my weakness and proceeded\r\n\r\n      as we rode up to the gateway i perceived it slightly open and\r\n      the visage of a man peering through in an instant afterward\r\n      this man came forth accosted my companion by name shook him\r\n      cordially by the hand and begged him to alight it was monsieur\r\n      maillard himself he was a portly finelooking gentleman of the\r\n      old school with a polished manner and a certain air of gravity\r\n      dignity and authority which was very impressive\r\n\r\n      my friend having presented me mentioned my desire to inspect\r\n      the establishment and received monsieur maillards assurance\r\n      that he would show me all attention now took leave and i saw\r\n      him no more\r\n\r\n      when he had gone the superintendent ushered me into a small and\r\n      exceedingly neat parlor containing among other indications of\r\n      refined taste many books drawings pots of flowers and musical\r\n      instruments a cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth at a piano\r\n      singing an aria from bellini sat a young and very beautiful\r\n      woman who at my entrance paused in her song and received me\r\n      with graceful courtesy her voice was low and her whole manner\r\n      subdued i thought too that i perceived the traces of sorrow in\r\n      her countenance which was excessively although to my taste not\r\n      unpleasingly pale she was attired in deep mourning and excited\r\n      in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect interest and\r\n      admiration\r\n\r\n      i had heard at paris that the institution of monsieur maillard\r\n      was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the system of\r\n      soothingthat all punishments were avoidedthat even confinement\r\n      was seldom resorted tothat the patients while secretly watched\r\n      were left much apparent liberty and that most of them were\r\n      permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary\r\n      apparel of persons in right mind\r\n\r\n      keeping these impressions in view i was cautious in what i said\r\n      before the young lady for i could not be sure that she was sane\r\n      and in fact there was a certain restless brilliancy about her\r\n      eyes which half led me to imagine she was not i confined my\r\n      remarks therefore to general topics and to such as i thought\r\n      would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic she\r\n      replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that i said and\r\n      even her original observations were marked with the soundest good\r\n      sense but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania had\r\n      taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity and i\r\n      continued to practise throughout the interview the caution with\r\n      which i commenced it\r\n\r\n      presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit\r\n      wine and other refreshments of which i partook the lady soon\r\n      afterward leaving the room as she departed i turned my eyes in\r\n      an inquiring manner toward my host\r\n\r\n      no he said oh noa member of my familymy niece and a most\r\n      accomplished woman\r\n\r\n      i beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion i replied but of\r\n      course you will know how to excuse me the excellent\r\n      administration of your affairs here is well understood in paris\r\n      and i thought it just possible you know\r\n\r\n      yes yessay no moreor rather it is myself who should thank you\r\n      for the commendable prudence you have displayed we seldom find\r\n      so much of forethought in young men and more than once some\r\n      unhappy contretemps has occurred in consequence of\r\n      thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors while my former\r\n      system was in operation and my patients were permitted the\r\n      privilege of roaming to and fro at will they were often aroused\r\n      to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to\r\n      inspect the house hence i was obliged to enforce a rigid system\r\n      of exclusion and none obtained access to the premises upon whose\r\n      discretion i could not rely\r\n\r\n      while your former system was in operation i said repeating\r\n      his wordsdo i understand you then to say that the soothing\r\n      system of which i have heard so much is no longer in force\r\n\r\n      it is now he replied several weeks since we have concluded\r\n      to renounce it forever\r\n\r\n      indeed you astonish me\r\n\r\n      we found it sir he said with a sigh absolutely necessary\r\n      to return to the old usages the danger of the soothing system\r\n      was at all times appalling and its advantages have been much\r\n      overrated i believe sir that in this house it has been given a\r\n      fair trial if ever in any we did every thing that rational\r\n      humanity could suggest i am sorry that you could not have paid\r\n      us a visit at an earlier period that you might have judged for\r\n      yourself but i presume you are conversant with the soothing\r\n      practicewith its details\r\n\r\n      not altogether what i have heard has been at third or fourth\r\n      hand\r\n\r\n      i may state the system then in general terms as one in which\r\n      the patients were menagéshumored we contradicted no fancies\r\n      which entered the brains of the mad on the contrary we not only\r\n      indulged but encouraged them and many of our most permanent\r\n      cures have been thus effected there is no argument which so\r\n      touches the feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad\r\n      absurdum we have had men for example who fancied themselves\r\n      chickens the cure was to insist upon the thing as a factto\r\n      accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it\r\n      to be a factand thus to refuse him any other diet for a week\r\n      than that which properly appertains to a chicken in this manner\r\n      a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders\r\n\r\n      but was this species of acquiescence all\r\n\r\n      by no means we put much faith in amusements of a simple kind\r\n      such as music dancing gymnastic exercises generally cards\r\n      certain classes of books and so forth we affected to treat each\r\n      individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder and the\r\n      word lunacy was never employed a great point was to set each\r\n      lunatic to guard the actions of all the others to repose\r\n      confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman is to\r\n      gain him body and soul in this way we were enabled to dispense\r\n      with an expensive body of keepers\r\n\r\n      and you had no punishments of any kind\r\n\r\n      none\r\n\r\n      and you never confined your patients\r\n\r\n      very rarely now and then the malady of some individual growing\r\n      to a crisis or taking a sudden turn of fury we conveyed him to\r\n      a secret cell lest his disorder should infect the rest and\r\n      there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friendsfor with\r\n      the raging maniac we have nothing to do he is usually removed to\r\n      the public hospitals\r\n\r\n      and you have now changed all thisand you think for the better\r\n\r\n      decidedly the system had its disadvantages and even its\r\n      dangers it is now happily exploded throughout all the maisons\r\n      de santé of france\r\n\r\n      i am very much surprised i said at what you tell me for i\r\n      made sure that at this moment no other method of treatment for\r\n      mania existed in any portion of the country\r\n\r\n      you are young yet my friend replied my host but the time\r\n      will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is\r\n      going on in the world without trusting to the gossip of others\r\n      believe nothing you hear and only onehalf that you see now\r\n      about our maisons de santé it is clear that some ignoramus has\r\n      misled you after dinner however when you have sufficiently\r\n      recovered from the fatigue of your ride i will be happy to take\r\n      you over the house and introduce to you a system which in my\r\n      opinion and in that of every one who has witnessed its\r\n      operation is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised\r\n\r\n      your own i inquiredone of your own invention\r\n\r\n      i am proud he replied to acknowledge that it isat least in\r\n      some measure\r\n\r\n      in this manner i conversed with monsieur maillard for an hour or\r\n      two during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of\r\n      the place\r\n\r\n      i cannot let you see my patients he said just at present to\r\n      a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in\r\n      such exhibitions and i do not wish to spoil your appetite for\r\n      dinner we will dine i can give you some veal a la menehoult\r\n      with cauliflowers in velouté sauceafter that a glass of clos\r\n      de vougeotthen your nerves will be sufficiently steadied\r\n\r\n      at six dinner was announced and my host conducted me into a\r\n      large salle à manger where a very numerous company were\r\n      assembledtwentyfive or thirty in all they were apparently\r\n      people of rankcertainly of high breedingalthough their\r\n      habiliments i thought were extravagantly rich partaking\r\n      somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the vielle\r\n      cour i noticed that at least twothirds of these guests were\r\n      ladies and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what\r\n      a parisian would consider good taste at the present day many\r\n      females for example whose age could not have been less than\r\n      seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry such as rings\r\n      bracelets and earrings and wore their bosoms and arms\r\n      shamefully bare i observed too that very few of the dresses\r\n      were well madeor at least that very few of them fitted the\r\n      wearers in looking about i discovered the interesting girl to\r\n      whom monsieur maillard had presented me in the little parlor but\r\n      my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale\r\n      with highheeled shoes and a dirty cap of brussels lace so much\r\n      too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive\r\n      expression when i had first seen her she was attired most\r\n      becomingly in deep mourning there was an air of oddity in\r\n      short about the dress of the whole party which at first\r\n      caused me to recur to my original idea of the soothing system\r\n      and to fancy that monsieur maillard had been willing to deceive\r\n      me until after dinner that i might experience no uncomfortable\r\n      feelings during the repast at finding myself dining with\r\n      lunatics but i remembered having been informed in paris that\r\n      the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people\r\n      with a vast number of antiquated notions and then too upon\r\n      conversing with several members of the company my apprehensions\r\n      were immediately and fully dispelled\r\n\r\n      the diningroom itself although perhaps sufficiently comfortable\r\n      and of good dimensions had nothing too much of elegance about\r\n      it for example the floor was uncarpeted in france however a\r\n      carpet is frequently dispensed with the windows too were\r\n      without curtains the shutters being shut were securely\r\n      fastened with iron bars applied diagonally after the fashion of\r\n      our ordinary shopshutters the apartment i observed formed in\r\n      itself a wing of the château and thus the windows were on three\r\n      sides of the parallelogram the door being at the other there\r\n      were no less than ten windows in all\r\n\r\n      the table was superbly set out it was loaded with plate and\r\n      more than loaded with delicacies the profusion was absolutely\r\n      barbaric there were meats enough to have feasted the anakim\r\n      never in all my life had i witnessed so lavish so wasteful an\r\n      expenditure of the good things of life there seemed very little\r\n      taste however in the arrangements and my eyes accustomed to\r\n      quiet lights were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a\r\n      multitude of wax candles which in silver candelabra were\r\n      deposited upon the table and all about the room wherever it was\r\n      possible to find a place there were several active servants in\r\n      attendance and upon a large table at the farther end of the\r\n      apartment were seated seven or eight people with fiddles fifes\r\n      trombones and a drum these fellows annoyed me very much at\r\n      intervals during the repast by an infinite variety of noises\r\n      which were intended for music and which appeared to afford much\r\n      entertainment to all present with the exception of myself\r\n\r\n      upon the whole i could not help thinking that there was much of\r\n      the bizarre about every thing i sawbut then the world is made up\r\n      of all kinds of persons with all modes of thought and all sorts\r\n      of conventional customs i had travelled too so much as to be\r\n      quite an adept at the nil admirari so i took my seat very coolly\r\n      at the right hand of my host and having an excellent appetite\r\n      did justice to the good cheer set before me\r\n\r\n      the conversation in the meantime was spirited and general the\r\n      ladies as usual talked a great deal i soon found that nearly\r\n      all the company were well educated and my host was a world of\r\n      goodhumored anecdote in himself he seemed quite willing to\r\n      speak of his position as superintendent of amaison de santé\r\n      and indeed the topic of lunacy was much to my surprise a\r\n      favorite one with all present a great many amusing stories were\r\n      told having reference to the whims of the patients\r\n\r\n      we had a fellow here once said a fat little gentleman who sat\r\n      at my righta fellow that fancied himself a teapot and by the\r\n      way is it not especially singular how often this particular\r\n      crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic there is scarcely\r\n      an insane asylum in france which cannot supply a human teapot\r\n      our gentleman was a britanniaware teapot and was careful to\r\n      polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting\r\n\r\n      and then said a tall man just opposite we had here not long\r\n      ago a person who had taken it into his head that he was a\r\n      donkeywhich allegorically speaking you will say was quite\r\n      true he was a troublesome patient and we had much ado to keep\r\n      him within bounds for a long time he would eat nothing but\r\n      thistles but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon\r\n      his eating nothing else then he was perpetually kicking out his\r\n      heelssoso\r\n\r\n      mr de kock i will thank you to behave yourself here\r\n      interrupted an old lady who sat next to the speaker please\r\n      keep your feet to yourself you have spoiled my brocade is it\r\n      necessary pray to illustrate a remark in so practical a style\r\n      our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this upon\r\n      my word you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate\r\n      imagined himself your acting is very natural as i live\r\n\r\n      mille pardons mamselle replied monsieur de kock thus\r\n      addresseda thousand pardons i had no intention of offending\r\n      mamselle laplacemonsieur de kock will do himself the honor of\r\n      taking wine with you\r\n\r\n      here monsieur de kock bowed low kissed his hand with much\r\n      ceremony and took wine with mamselle laplace\r\n\r\n      allow me mon ami now said monsieur maillard addressing\r\n      myself allow me to send you a morsel of this veal à la st\r\n      menehoultyou will find it particularly fine\r\n\r\n      at this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in\r\n      depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish or trencher\r\n      containing what i supposed to be the monstrum horrendum\r\n      informe ingens cui lumen ademptum a closer scrutiny assured\r\n      me however that it was only a small calf roasted whole and set\r\n      upon its knees with an apple in its mouth as is the english\r\n      fashion of dressing a hare\r\n\r\n      thank you no i replied to say the truth i am not\r\n      particularly partial to veal à la stwhat is itfor i do not\r\n      find that it altogether agrees with me i will change my plate\r\n      however and try some of the rabbit\r\n\r\n      there were several sidedishes on the table containing what\r\n      appeared to be the ordinary french rabbita very delicious\r\n      morceau which i can recommend\r\n\r\n      pierre cried the host change this gentlemans plate and\r\n      give him a sidepiece of this rabbit auchat\r\n\r\n      this what said i\r\n\r\n      this rabbit auchat\r\n\r\n      why thank youupon second thoughts no i will just help myself\r\n      to some of the ham\r\n\r\n      there is no knowing what one eats thought i to myself at the\r\n      tables of these people of the province i will have none of their\r\n      rabbit auchatand for the matter of that none of their\r\n      cataurabbit either\r\n\r\n      and then said a cadaverous looking personage near the foot of\r\n      the table taking up the thread of the conversation where it had\r\n      been broken offand then among other oddities we had a\r\n      patient once upon a time who very pertinaciously maintained\r\n      himself to be a cordova cheese and went about with a knife in\r\n      his hand soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the\r\n      middle of his leg\r\n\r\n      he was a great fool beyond doubt interposed some one but\r\n      not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know\r\n      with the exception of this strange gentleman i mean the man who\r\n      took himself for a bottle of champagne and always went off with\r\n      a pop and a fizz in this fashion\r\n\r\n      here the speaker very rudely as i thought put his right thumb\r\n      in his left cheek withdrew it with a sound resembling the\r\n      popping of a cork and then by a dexterous movement of the\r\n      tongue upon the teeth created a sharp hissing and fizzing which\r\n      lasted for several minutes in imitation of the frothing of\r\n      champagne this behavior i saw plainly was not very pleasing to\r\n      monsieur maillard but that gentleman said nothing and the\r\n      conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig\r\n\r\n      and then there was an ignoramus said he who mistook himself\r\n      for a frog which by the way he resembled in no little degree\r\n      i wish you could have seen him sirhere the speaker addressed\r\n      myselfit would have done your heart good to see the natural\r\n      airs that he put on sir if that man was not a frog i can only\r\n      observe that it is a pity he was not his croak\r\n      thusooooghoooogh was the finest note in the worldb\r\n      flat and when he put his elbows upon the table thusafter taking\r\n      a glass or two of wineand distended his mouth thus and rolled\r\n      up his eyes thus and winked them with excessive rapidity thus\r\n      why then sir i take it upon myself to say positively that you\r\n      would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man\r\n\r\n      i have no doubt of it i said\r\n\r\n      and then said somebody else then there was petit gaillard\r\n      who thought himself a pinch of snuff and was truly distressed\r\n      because he could not take himself between his own finger and\r\n      thumb\r\n\r\n      and then there was jules desoulières who was a very singular\r\n      genius indeed and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin\r\n      he persecuted the cook to make him up into piesa thing which the\r\n      cook indignantly refused to do for my part i am by no means\r\n      sure that a pumpkin pie à la desoulières would not have been\r\n      very capital eating indeed\r\n\r\n      you astonish me said i and i looked inquisitively at monsieur\r\n      maillard\r\n\r\n      ha ha ha said that gentlemanhe he hehi hi hiho\r\n      ho hohu hu huvery good indeed you must not be astonished\r\n      mon ami our friend here is a wita drôleyou must not\r\n      understand him to the letter\r\n\r\n      and then said some other one of the partythen there was\r\n      bouffon le grandanother extraordinary personage in his way he\r\n      grew deranged through love and fancied himself possessed of two\r\n      heads one of these he maintained to be the head of cicero the\r\n      other he imagined a composite one being demosthenes from the\r\n      top of the forehead to the mouth and lord broughams from the\r\n      mouth to the chin it is not impossible that he was wrong but he\r\n      would have convinced you of his being in the right for he was a\r\n      man of great eloquence he had an absolute passion for oratory\r\n      and could not refrain from display for example he used to leap\r\n      upon the dinnertable thus andand\r\n\r\n      here a friend at the side of the speaker put a hand upon his\r\n      shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear upon which he\r\n      ceased talking with great suddenness and sank back within his\r\n      chair\r\n\r\n      and then said the friend who had whispered there was\r\n      boullard the teetotum i call him the teetotum because in\r\n      fact he was seized with the droll but not altogether\r\n      irrational crotchet that he had been converted into a\r\n      teetotum you would have roared with laughter to see him spin\r\n      he would turn round upon one heel by the hour in this\r\n      mannerso\r\n\r\n      here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper\r\n      performed an exactly similar office for himself\r\n\r\n      but then cried the old lady at the top of her voice your\r\n      monsieur boullard was a madman and a very silly madman at best\r\n      for who allow me to ask you ever heard of a human teetotum\r\n      the thing is absurd madame joyeuse was a more sensible person\r\n      as you know she had a crotchet but it was instinct with common\r\n      sense and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her\r\n      acquaintance she found upon mature deliberation that by some\r\n      accident she had been turned into a chickencock but as such\r\n      she behaved with propriety she flapped her wings with prodigious\r\n      effectsososoand as for her crow it was delicious\r\n      cockadoodledoocockadoodledoocockadoodlededoo\r\n      dooodooooooo\r\n\r\n      madame joyeuse i will thank you to behave yourself here\r\n      interrupted our host very angrily you can either conduct\r\n      yourself as a lady should do or you can quit the table\r\n      forthwithtake your choice\r\n\r\n      the lady whom i was much astonished to hear addressed as madame\r\n      joyeuse after the description of madame joyeuse she had just\r\n      given blushed up to the eyebrows and seemed exceedingly abashed\r\n      at the reproof she hung down her head and said not a syllable\r\n      in reply but another and younger lady resumed the theme it was\r\n      my beautiful girl of the little parlor\r\n\r\n      oh madame joyeuse was a fool she exclaimed but there was\r\n      really much sound sense after all in the opinion of eugénie\r\n      salsafette she was a very beautiful and painfully modest young\r\n      lady who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent and\r\n      wished to dress herself always by getting outside instead of\r\n      inside of her clothes it is a thing very easily done after all\r\n      you have only to do soand then sososoand then sososoand\r\n      then sosoand then\r\n\r\n      mon dieu mamselle salsafette here cried a dozen voices at\r\n      once what are you aboutforbearthat is sufficientwe see\r\n      very plainly how it is donehold hold and several persons\r\n      were already leaping from their seats to withhold mamselle\r\n      salsafette from putting herself upon a par with the medicean\r\n      venus when the point was very effectually and suddenly\r\n      accomplished by a series of loud screams or yells from some\r\n      portion of the main body of the château\r\n\r\n      my nerves were very much affected indeed by these yells but\r\n      the rest of the company i really pitied i never saw any set of\r\n      reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life they all\r\n      grew as pale as so many corpses and shrinking within their\r\n      seats sat quivering and gibbering with terror and listening for\r\n      a repetition of the sound it came againlouder and seemingly\r\n      nearerand then a third time very loud and then a fourth time\r\n      with a vigor evidently diminished at this apparent dying away of\r\n      the noise the spirits of the company were immediately regained\r\n      and all was life and anecdote as before i now ventured to\r\n      inquire the cause of the disturbance\r\n\r\n      a mere bagatelle said monsieur maillard we are used to\r\n      these things and care really very little about them the\r\n      lunatics every now and then get up a howl in concert one\r\n      starting another as is sometimes the case with a bevy of dogs at\r\n      night it occasionally happens however that the concerto\r\n      yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose\r\n      when of course some little danger is to be apprehended\r\n\r\n      and how many have you in charge\r\n\r\n      at present we have not more than ten altogether\r\n\r\n      principally females i presume\r\n\r\n      oh noevery one of them men and stout fellows too i can tell\r\n      you\r\n\r\n      indeed i have always understood that the majority of lunatics\r\n      were of the gentler sex\r\n\r\n      it is generally so but not always some time ago there were\r\n      about twentyseven patients here and of that number no less\r\n      than eighteen were women but lately matters have changed very\r\n      much as you see\r\n\r\n      yeshave changed very much as you see here interrupted the\r\n      gentleman who had broken the shins of mamselle laplace\r\n\r\n      yeshave changed very much as you see chimed in the whole\r\n      company at once\r\n\r\n      hold your tongues every one of you said my host in a great\r\n      rage whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for\r\n      nearly a minute as for one lady she obeyed monsieur maillard to\r\n      the letter and thrusting out her tongue which was an\r\n      excessively long one held it very resignedly with both hands\r\n      until the end of the entertainment\r\n\r\n      and this gentlewoman said i to monsieur maillard bending\r\n      over and addressing him in a whisperthis good lady who has just\r\n      spoken and who gives us the cockadoodlededooshe i presume\r\n      is harmlessquite harmless eh\r\n\r\n      harmless ejaculated he in unfeigned surprise whywhy what\r\n      can you mean\r\n\r\n      only slightly touched said i touching my head i take it for\r\n      granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected\r\n      eh\r\n\r\n      mon dieu what is it you imagine this lady my particular old\r\n      friend madame joyeuse is as absolutely sane as myself she has\r\n      her little eccentricities to be surebut then you know all old\r\n      womenall very old womenare more or less eccentric\r\n\r\n      to be sure said ito be sureand then the rest of these\r\n      ladies and gentlemen\r\n\r\n      are my friends and keepers interupted monsieur maillard\r\n      drawing himself up with hauteurmy very good friends and\r\n      assistants\r\n\r\n      what all of them i askedthe women and all\r\n\r\n      assuredly he saidwe could not do at all without the women\r\n      they are the best lunatic nurses in the world they have a way of\r\n      their own you know their bright eyes have a marvellous\r\n      effectsomething like the fascination of the snake you know\r\n\r\n      to be sure said ito be sure they behave a little odd\r\n      ehthey are a little queer ehdont you think so\r\n\r\n      oddqueerwhy do you really think so we are not very\r\n      prudish to be sure here in the southdo pretty much as we\r\n      pleaseenjoy life and all that sort of thing you know\r\n\r\n      to be sure said ito be sure\r\n\r\n      and then perhaps this clos de vougeot is a little heady you\r\n      knowa little strongyou understand eh\r\n\r\n      to be sure said ito be sure by the bye monsieur did i\r\n      understand you to say that the system you have adopted in place\r\n      of the celebrated soothing system was one of very rigorous\r\n      severity\r\n\r\n      by no means our confinement is necessarily close but the\r\n      treatmentthe medical treatment i meanis rather agreeable to\r\n      the patients than otherwise\r\n\r\n      and the new system is one of your own invention\r\n\r\n      not altogether some portions of it are referable to professor\r\n      tarr of whom you have necessarily heard and again there are\r\n      modifications in my plan which i am happy to acknowledge as\r\n      belonging of right to the celebrated fether with whom if i\r\n      mistake not you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance\r\n\r\n      i am quite ashamed to confess i replied that i have never\r\n      even heard the names of either gentleman before\r\n\r\n      good heavens ejaculated my host drawing back his chair\r\n      abruptly and uplifting his hands i surely do not hear you\r\n      aright you did not intend to say eh that you had never heard\r\n      either of the learned doctor tarr or of the celebrated professor\r\n      fether\r\n\r\n      i am forced to acknowledge my ignorance i replied but the\r\n      truth should be held inviolate above all things nevertheless i\r\n      feel humbled to the dust not to be acquainted with the works of\r\n      these no doubt extraordinary men i will seek out their\r\n      writings forthwith and peruse them with deliberate care\r\n      monsieur maillard you have reallyi must confess ityou have\r\n      reallymade me ashamed of myself\r\n\r\n      and this was the fact\r\n\r\n      say no more my good young friend he said kindly pressing my\r\n      handjoin me now in a glass of sauterne\r\n\r\n      we drank the company followed our example without stint they\r\n      chattedthey jestedthey laughedthey perpetrated a thousand\r\n      absurditiesthe fiddles shriekedthe drum rowdedowedthe\r\n      trombones bellowed like so many brazen bulls of phalarisand the\r\n      whole scene growing gradually worse and worse as the wines\r\n      gained the ascendancy became at length a sort of pandemonium in\r\n      petto in the meantime monsieur maillard and myself with some\r\n      bottles of sauterne and vougeot between us continued our\r\n      conversation at the top of the voice a word spoken in an\r\n      ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice\r\n      of a fish from the bottom of niagara falls\r\n\r\n      and sir said i screaming in his ear you mentioned\r\n      something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old\r\n      system of soothing how is that\r\n\r\n      yes he replied there was occasionally very great danger\r\n      indeed there is no accounting for the caprices of madmen and\r\n      in my opinion as well as in that of dr tarr and professor\r\n      fether it is never safe to permit them to run at large\r\n      unattended a lunatic may be soothed as it is called for a\r\n      time but in the end he is very apt to become obstreperous his\r\n      cunning too is proverbial and great if he has a project in\r\n      view he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom and the\r\n      dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity presents to the\r\n      metaphysician one of the most singular problems in the study of\r\n      mind when a madman appears thoroughly sane indeed it is high\r\n      time to put him in a straitjacket\r\n\r\n      but the danger my dear sir of which you were speaking in your\r\n      own experienceduring your control of this househave you had\r\n      practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a\r\n      lunatic\r\n\r\n      herein my own experiencewhy i may say yes for exampleno\r\n      very long while ago a singular circumstance occurred in this\r\n      very house the soothing system you know was then in\r\n      operation and the patients were at large they behaved\r\n      remarkably wellespecially soany one of sense might have known\r\n      that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact\r\n      that the fellows behaved so remarkably well and sure enough\r\n      one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and\r\n      foot and thrown into the cells where they were attended as if\r\n      they were the lunatics by the lunatics themselves who had\r\n      usurped the offices of the keepers\r\n\r\n      you dont tell me so i never heard of any thing so absurd in my\r\n      life\r\n\r\n      factit all came to pass by means of a stupid fellowa\r\n      lunaticwho by some means had taken it into his head that he\r\n      had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of\r\n      beforeof lunatic government i mean he wished to give his\r\n      invention a trial i suppose and so he persuaded the rest of the\r\n      patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the\r\n      reigning powers\r\n\r\n      and he really succeeded\r\n\r\n      no doubt of it the keepers and kept were soon made to exchange\r\n      places not that exactly eitherfor the madmen had been free but\r\n      the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith and treated i am\r\n      sorry to say in a very cavalier manner\r\n\r\n      but i presume a counterrevolution was soon effected this\r\n      condition of things could not have long existed the country\r\n      people in the neighborhoodvisitors coming to see the\r\n      establishmentwould have given the alarm\r\n\r\n      there you are out the head rebel was too cunning for that he\r\n      admitted no visitors at allwith the exception one day of a\r\n      very stupidlooking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to\r\n      be afraid he let him in to see the placejust by way of\r\n      varietyto have a little fun with him as soon as he had\r\n      gammoned him sufficiently he let him out and sent him about his\r\n      business\r\n\r\n      and how long then did the madmen reign\r\n\r\n      oh a very long time indeeda month certainlyhow much longer i\r\n      cant precisely say in the meantime the lunatics had a jolly\r\n      season of itthat you may swear they doffed their own shabby\r\n      clothes and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels the\r\n      cellars of the château were well stocked with wine and these\r\n      madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it they lived\r\n      well i can tell you\r\n\r\n      and the treatmentwhat was the particular species of treatment\r\n      which the leader of the rebels put into operation\r\n\r\n      why as for that a madman is not necessarily a fool as i have\r\n      already observed and it is my honest opinion that his treatment\r\n      was a much better treatment than that which it superseded it was\r\n      a very capital system indeedsimpleneatno trouble at allin\r\n      fact it was deliciousit was\r\n\r\n      here my hosts observations were cut short by another series of\r\n      yells of the same character as those which had previously\r\n      disconcerted us this time however they seemed to proceed from\r\n      persons rapidly approaching\r\n\r\n      gracious heavens i ejaculatedthe lunatics have most\r\n      undoubtedly broken loose\r\n\r\n      i very much fear it is so replied monsieur maillard now\r\n      becoming excessively pale he had scarcely finished the sentence\r\n      before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the\r\n      windows and immediately afterward it became evident that some\r\n      persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room\r\n      the door was beaten with what appeared to be a sledgehammer and\r\n      the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence\r\n\r\n      a scene of the most terrible confusion ensued monsieur maillard\r\n      to my excessive astonishment threw himself under the sideboard\r\n      i had expected more resolution at his hands the members of the\r\n      orchestra who for the last fifteen minutes had been seemingly\r\n      too much intoxicated to do duty now sprang all at once to their\r\n      feet and to their instruments and scrambling upon their table\r\n      broke out with one accord into yankee doodle which they\r\n      performed if not exactly in tune at least with an energy\r\n      superhuman during the whole of the uproar\r\n\r\n      meantime upon the main diningtable among the bottles and\r\n      glasses leaped the gentleman who with such difficulty had been\r\n      restrained from leaping there before as soon as he fairly\r\n      settled himself he commenced an oration which no doubt was a\r\n      very capital one if it could only have been heard at the same\r\n      moment the man with the teetotum predilection set himself to\r\n      spinning around the apartment with immense energy and with arms\r\n      outstretched at right angles with his body so that he had all\r\n      the air of a teetotum in fact and knocked everybody down that\r\n      happened to get in his way and now too hearing an incredible\r\n      popping and fizzing of champagne i discovered at length that it\r\n      proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that\r\n      delicate drink during dinner and then again the frogman\r\n      croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every\r\n      note that he uttered and in the midst of all this the\r\n      continuous braying of a donkey arose over all as for my old\r\n      friend madame joyeuse i really could have wept for the poor\r\n      lady she appeared so terribly perplexed all she did however\r\n      was to stand up in a corner by the fireplace and sing out\r\n      incessantly at the top of her voice cockadoodlededooooooh\r\n\r\n      and now came the climaxthe catastrophe of the drama as no\r\n      resistance beyond whooping and yelling and cockadoodling was\r\n      offered to the encroachments of the party without the ten\r\n      windows were very speedily and almost simultaneously broken in\r\n      but i shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with\r\n      which i gazed when leaping through these windows and down\r\n      among us pêlemêle fighting stamping scratching and\r\n      howling there rushed a perfect army of what i took to be\r\n      chimpanzees ourangoutangs or big black baboons of the cape of\r\n      good hope\r\n\r\n      i received a terrible beatingafter which i rolled under a sofa\r\n      and lay still after lying there some fifteen minutes during\r\n      which time i listened with all my ears to what was going on in\r\n      the room i came to same satisfactory dénouement of this\r\n      tragedy monsieur maillard it appeared in giving me the account\r\n      of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion had been\r\n      merely relating his own exploits this gentleman had indeed\r\n      some two or three years before been the superintendent of the\r\n      establishment but grew crazy himself and so became a patient\r\n      this fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced\r\n      me the keepers ten in number having been suddenly overpowered\r\n      were first well tarred then carefully feathered and then shut\r\n      up in underground cells they had been so imprisoned for more\r\n      than a month during which period monsieur maillard had\r\n      generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers which\r\n      constituted his system but some bread and abundance of water\r\n      the latter was pumped on them daily at length one escaping\r\n      through a sewer gave freedom to all the rest\r\n\r\n      the soothing system with important modifications has been\r\n      resumed at the château yet i cannot help agreeing with\r\n      monsieur maillard that his own treatment was a very capital\r\n      one of its kind as he justly observed it was simpleneatand\r\n      gave no trouble at allnot the least\r\n\r\n      i have only to add that although i have searched every library\r\n      in europe for the works of doctor tarr and professor fether\r\n      i have up to the present day utterly failed in my endeavors at\r\n      procuring an edition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe literary life of thingum bob esq\r\n\r\nlate editor of the goosetherumfoodle\r\nby himself\r\n\r\n\r\n      i am now growing in years andsince i understand that\r\n      shakespeare and mr emmons are deceasedit is not impossible that\r\n      i may even die it has occurred to me therefore that i may as\r\n      well retire from the field of letters and repose upon my laurels\r\n      but i am ambitious of signalizing my abdication of the literary\r\n      sceptre by some important bequest to posterity and perhaps i\r\n      cannot do a better thing than just pen for it an account of my\r\n      earlier career my name indeed has been so long and so\r\n      constantly before the public eye that i am not only willing to\r\n      admit the naturalness of the interest which it has everywhere\r\n      excited but ready to satisfy the extreme curiosity which it has\r\n      inspired in fact it is no more than the duty of him who\r\n      achieves greatness to leave behind him in his ascent such\r\n      landmarks as may guide others to be great i propose therefore\r\n      in the present paper which i had some idea of calling\r\n      memoranda to serve for the literary history of america to\r\n      give a detail of those important yet feeble and tottering first\r\n      steps by which at length i attained the high road to the\r\n      pinnacle of human renown\r\n\r\n      of ones very remote ancestors it is superfluous to say much my\r\n      father thomas bob esq stood for many years at the summit of\r\n      his profession which was that of a merchantbarber in the city\r\n      of smug his warehouse was the resort of all the principal people\r\n      of the place and especially of the editorial corpsa body which\r\n      inspires all about it with profound veneration and awe for my\r\n      own part i regarded them as gods and drank in with avidity the\r\n      rich wit and wisdom which continuously flowed from their august\r\n      mouths during the process of what is styled lather my first\r\n      moment of positive inspiration must be dated from that\r\n      evermemorable epoch when the brilliant conductor of the\r\n      gadfly in the intervals of the important process just\r\n      mentioned recited aloud before a conclave of our apprentices\r\n      an inimitable poem in honor of the only genuine oilofbob so\r\n      called from its talented inventor my father and for which\r\n      effusion the editor of the fly was remunerated with a regal\r\n      liberality by the firm of thomas bob  company merchantbarbers\r\n\r\n      the genius of the stanzas to the oilofbob first breathed into\r\n      me i say the divine afflatus i resolved at once to become a\r\n      great man and to commence by becoming a great poet that very\r\n      evening i fell upon my knees at the feet of my father\r\n\r\n      father i said pardon mebut i have a soul above lather it\r\n      is my firm intention to cut the shop i would be an editori\r\n      would be a poeti would pen stanzas to the oilofbob pardon\r\n      me and aid me to be great\r\n\r\n      my dear thingum replied my father i had been christened\r\n      thingum after a wealthy relative so surnamed my dear thingum\r\n      he said raising me from my knees by the earsthingum my boy\r\n      youre a trump and take after your father in having a soul you\r\n      have an immense head too and it must hold a great many brains\r\n      this i have long seen and therefore had thoughts of making you a\r\n      lawyer the business however has grown ungenteel and that of a\r\n      politician dont pay upon the whole you judge wiselythe trade\r\n      of editor is bestand if you can be a poet at the same timeas\r\n      most of the editors are by the bywhy you will kill two birds\r\n      with one stone to encourage you in the beginning of things i\r\n      will allow you a garret pen ink and paper a rhyming\r\n      dictionary and a copy of the gadfly i suppose you would\r\n      scarcely demand any more\r\n\r\n      i would be an ungrateful villain if i did i replied with\r\n      enthusiasm your generosity is boundless i will repay it by\r\n      making you the father of a genius\r\n\r\n      thus ended my conference with the best of men and immediately\r\n      upon its termination i betook myself with zeal to my poetical\r\n      labors as upon these chiefly i founded my hopes of ultimate\r\n      elevation to the editorial chair\r\n\r\n      in my first attempts at composition i found the stanzas to the\r\n      oilofbob rather a drawback than otherwise their splendor\r\n      more dazzled than enlightened me the contemplation of their\r\n      excellence tended naturally to discourage me by comparison with\r\n      my own abortions so that for a long time i labored in vain at\r\n      length there came into my head one of those exquisitely original\r\n      ideas which now and then will permeate the brain of a man of\r\n      genius it was thisor rather thus was it carried into\r\n      execution from the rubbish of an old bookstall in a very\r\n      remote corner of the town i got together several antique and\r\n      altogether unknown or forgotten volumes the bookseller sold them\r\n      to me for a song from one of these which purported to be a\r\n      translation of one dantes inferno i copied with remarkable\r\n      neatness a long passage about a man named ugolino who had a\r\n      parcel of brats from another which contained a good many old\r\n      plays by some person whose name i forget i extracted in the same\r\n      manner and with the same care a great number of lines about\r\n      angels and ministers saying grace and goblins damned and\r\n      more besides of that sort from a third which was the\r\n      composition of some blind man or other either a greek or a\r\n      choctawi cannot be at the pains of remembering every trifle\r\n      exactlyi took about fifty verses beginning with achilles\r\n      wrath and grease and something else from a fourth which i\r\n      recollect was also the work of a blind man i selected a page or\r\n      two all about hail and holy light and although a blind man\r\n      has no business to write about light still the verses were\r\n      sufficiently good in their way\r\n\r\n      having made fair copies of these poems i signed every one of\r\n      them oppodeldoc a fine sonorous name and doing each up\r\n      nicely in a separate envelope i despatched one to each of the\r\n      four principal magazines with a request for speedy insertion and\r\n      prompt pay the result of this well conceived plan however the\r\n      success of which would have saved me much trouble in after life\r\n      served to convince me that some editors are not to be bamboozled\r\n      and gave the coupdegrace as they say in france to my\r\n      nascent hopes as they say in the city of the transcendentals\r\n\r\n      the fact is that each and every one of the magazines in\r\n      question gave mr oppodeldoc a complete usingup in the\r\n      monthly notices to correspondents the humdrum gave him a\r\n      dressing after this fashion\r\n\r\n      oppodeldoc whoever he is has sent us a long tirade\r\n      concerning a bedlamite whom he styles ugolino who had a great\r\n      many children that should have been all whipped and sent to bed\r\n      without their suppers the whole affair is exceedingly tamenot\r\n      to say flat oppodeldoc whoever he is is entirely devoid\r\n      of imaginationand imagination in our humble opinion is not\r\n      only the soul of poesy but also its very heart oppodeldoc\r\n      whoever he is has the audacity to demand of us for his\r\n      twattle a speedy insertion and prompt pay we neither insert\r\n      nor purchase any stuff of the sort there can be no doubt\r\n      however that he would meet with a ready sale for all the\r\n      balderdash he can scribble at the office of either the\r\n      rowdydow the lollipop or the goosetherumfoodle\r\n\r\n      all this it must be acknowledged was very severe upon\r\n      oppodeldocbut the unkindest cut was putting the word poesy in\r\n      small caps in those five preeminent letters what a world of\r\n      bitterness is there not involved\r\n\r\n      but oppodeldoc was punished with equal severity in the\r\n      rowdydow which spoke thus\r\n\r\n      we have received a most singular and insolent communication from\r\n      a person whoever he is signing himself oppodeldocthus\r\n      desecrating the greatness of the illustrious roman emperor so\r\n      named accompanying the letter of oppodeldoc whoever he is\r\n      we find sundry lines of most disgusting and unmeaning rant about\r\n      angels and ministers of gracerant such as no madman short of a\r\n      nat lee or an oppodeldoc could possibly perpetrate and for\r\n      this trash of trash we are modestly requested to pay promptly\r\n      no sirno we pay for nothing of that sort apply to the\r\n      humdrum the lollipop or the goosetherumfoodle these\r\n      periodicals will undoubtedly accept any literary offal you may\r\n      send themand as undoubtedly promise to pay for it\r\n\r\n      this was bitter indeed upon poor oppodeldoc but in this\r\n      instance the weight of the satire falls upon the humdrum the\r\n      lollipop and the goosetherumfoodle who are pungently styled\r\n      periodicalsin italics tooa thing that must have cut them\r\n      to the heart\r\n\r\n      scarcely less savage was the lollipop which thus discoursed\r\n\r\n      some individual who rejoices in the appellation oppodeldoc\r\n      to what low uses are the names of the illustrious dead too often\r\n      applied has enclosed us some fifty or sixty verses commencing\r\n      after this fashion\r\n\r\n      achilles wrath to greece the direful spring\r\n      of woes unnumbered c c c c\r\n\r\n      oppodeldoc whoever he is is respectfully informed that\r\n      there is not a printers devil in our office who is not in the\r\n      daily habit of composing better lines those of oppodeldoc\r\n      will not scan oppodeldoc should learn to count but why he\r\n      should have conceived the idea that we of all others we\r\n      would disgrace our pages with his ineffable nonsense is utterly\r\n      beyond comprehension why the absurd twattle is scarcely good\r\n      enough for the humdrum the rowdydow the\r\n      goosetherumfoodlethings that are in the practice of publishing\r\n      mother gooses melodies as original lyrics and oppodeldoc\r\n      whoever he is has even the assurance to demand pay for this\r\n      drivel does oppodeldoc whoever he is knowis he aware that\r\n      we could not be paid to insert it\r\n\r\n      as i perused this i felt myself growing gradually smaller and\r\n      smaller and when i came to the point at which the editor sneered\r\n      at the poem as verses there was little more than an ounce of me\r\n      left as for oppodeldoc i began to experience compassion for\r\n      the poor fellow but the goosetherumfoodle showed if possible\r\n      less mercy than the lollipop it was the goosetherumfoodle\r\n      that said\r\n\r\n      a wretched poetaster who signs himself oppodeldoc is silly\r\n      enough to fancy that we will print and pay for a medley of\r\n      incoherent and ungrammatical bombast which he has transmitted to\r\n      us and which commences with the following most intelligible\r\n      line\r\n\r\n      hail holy light offspring of heaven first born\r\n\r\n      we say most intelligible oppodeldoc whoever he is\r\n      will be kind enough to tell us perhaps how hail can be\r\n      holy light we always regarded it as frozen rain will he\r\n      inform us also how frozen rain can be at one and the same\r\n      time both holy light whatever that is and an\r\n      offspringwhich latter term if we understand any thing about\r\n      english is only employed with propriety in reference to small\r\n      babies of about six weeks old but it is preposterous to descant\r\n      upon such absurdityalthough oppodeldoc whoever he is has\r\n      the unparalleled effrontery to suppose that we will not only\r\n      insert his ignorant ravings but absolutely pay for them\r\n\r\n      now this is fineit is richand we have half a mind to punish\r\n      this young scribbler for his egotism by really publishing his\r\n      effusion verbatim et literatim as he has written it we could\r\n      inflict no punishment so severe and we would inflict it but\r\n      for the boredom which we should cause our readers in so doing\r\n\r\n      let oppodeldoc whoever he is send any future composition\r\n      of like character to the humdrum the lollipop or the\r\n      rowdydow they will insert it they insert every month\r\n      just such stuff send it to them we are not to be insulted with\r\n      impunity\r\n\r\n      this made an end of me and as for the humdrum the\r\n      rowdydow and the lollipop i never could comprehend how\r\n      they survived it the putting them in the smallest possible\r\n      minion that was the rubthereby insinuating their\r\n      lownesstheir baseness while we stood looking down upon them in\r\n      gigantic capitalsoh it was too bitterit was wormwoodit was\r\n      gall had i been either of these periodicals i would have spared\r\n      no pains to have the goosetherumfoodle prosecuted it might\r\n      have been done under the act for the prevention of cruelty to\r\n      animals as for oppodeldoc whoever he was i had by this\r\n      time lost all patience with the fellow and sympathized with him\r\n      no longer he was a fool beyond doubt whoever he was and got\r\n      not a kick more than he deserved\r\n\r\n      the result of my experiment with the old books convinced me in\r\n      the first place that honesty is the best policy and in the\r\n      second that if i could not write better than mr dante and the\r\n      two blind men and the rest of the old set it would at least\r\n      be a difficult matter to write worse i took heart therefore\r\n      and determined to prosecute the entirely original as they say\r\n      on the covers of the magazines at whatever cost of study and\r\n      pains i again placed before my eyes as a model the brilliant\r\n      stanzas on the oilofbob by the editor of the gadfly and\r\n      resolved to construct an ode on the same sublime theme in\r\n      rivalry of what had already been done\r\n\r\n      with my first verse i had no material difficulty it ran thus\r\n\r\n      to pen an ode upon the oilofbob\r\n\r\n      having carefully looked out however all the legitimate rhymes\r\n      to bob i found it impossible to proceed in this dilemma i had\r\n      recourse to paternal aid and after some hours of mature\r\n      thought my father and myself thus constructed the poem\r\n\r\n      to pen an ode upon the oilofbob\r\n      is all sorts of a job\r\n                          signed snob\r\n\r\n      to be sure this composition was of no very great lengthbut i\r\n      have yet to learn as they say in the edinburgh review that the\r\n      mere extent of a literary work has any thing to do with its\r\n      merit as for the quarterly cant about sustained effort it is\r\n      impossible to see the sense of it upon the whole therefore i\r\n      was satisfied with the success of my maiden attempt and now the\r\n      only question regarded the disposal i should make of it my\r\n      father suggested that i should send it to the gadflybut there\r\n      were two reasons which operated to prevent me from so doing i\r\n      dreaded the jealousy of the editorand i had ascertained that he\r\n      did not pay for original contributions i therefore after due\r\n      deliberation consigned the article to the more dignified pages\r\n      of the lollipop and awaited the event in anxiety but with\r\n      resignation\r\n\r\n      in the very next published number i had the proud satisfaction of\r\n      seeing my poem printed at length as the leading article with\r\n      the following significant words prefixed in italics and between\r\n      brackets\r\n\r\n      we call the attention of our readers to the subjoined admirable\r\n      stanza on the oil of bob we need say nothing of their\r\n      sublimity or their pathosit is impossible to peruse them\r\n      without tears those who have been nauseated with a sad dose on\r\n      the same august topic from the goose quill of the editor of the\r\n      gad fly will do well to compare the two compositions\r\n\r\n      p swe are consumed with anxiety to probe the mystery which\r\n      envelops the evident pseudonym snob may we hope for a personal\r\n      interview\r\n\r\n      all this was scarcely more than justice but it was i confess\r\n      rather more than i had expectedi acknowledged this be it\r\n      observed to the everlasting disgrace of my country and of\r\n      mankind i lost no time however in calling upon the editor of\r\n      the lollipop and had the good fortune to find this gentleman\r\n      at home he saluted me with an air of profound respect slightly\r\n      blended with a fatherly and patronizing admiration wrought in\r\n      him no doubt by my appearance of extreme youth and\r\n      inexperience begging me to be seated he entered at once upon\r\n      the subject of my poembut modesty will ever forbid me to repeat\r\n      the thousand compliments which he lavished upon me the eulogies\r\n      of mr crab such was the editors name were however by no\r\n      means fulsomely indiscriminate he analyzed my composition with\r\n      much freedom and great abilitynot hesitating to point out a few\r\n      trivial defectsa circumstance which elevated him highly in my\r\n      esteem the gadfly was of course brought upon the tapis\r\n      and i hope never to be subjected to a criticism so searching or\r\n      to rebukes so withering as were bestowed by mr crab upon that\r\n      unhappy effusion i had been accustomed to regard the editor of\r\n      the gadfly as something superhuman but mr crab soon\r\n      disabused me of that idea he set the literary as well as the\r\n      personal character of the fly so mr c satirically designated\r\n      the rival editor in its true light he the fly was very\r\n      little better than he should be he had written infamous things\r\n      he was a pennyaliner and a buffoon he was a villain he had\r\n      composed a tragedy which set the whole country in a guffaw and a\r\n      farce which deluged the universe in tears besides all this he\r\n      had the impudence to pen what he meant for a lampoon upon\r\n      himself mr crab and the temerity to style him an ass\r\n      should i at any time wish to express my opinion of mr fry the\r\n      pages of the lollipop mr crab assured me were at my\r\n      unlimited disposal in the meantime as it was very certain that\r\n      i would be attacked in the fly for my attempt at composing a\r\n      rival poem on the oilofbob he mr crab would take it upon\r\n      himself to attend pointedly to my private and personal\r\n      interests if i were not made a man of at once it should not be\r\n      the fault of himself mr crab\r\n\r\n      mr crab having now paused in his discourse the latter portion\r\n      of which i found it impossible to comprehend i ventured to\r\n      suggest something about the remuneration which i had been taught\r\n      to expect for my poem by an announcement on the cover of the\r\n      lollipop declaring that it the lollipop insisted upon\r\n      being permitted to pay exorbitant prices for all accepted\r\n      contributionsfrequently expending more money for a single brief\r\n      poem than the whole annual cost of the humdrum the\r\n      rowdydow and the goosetherumfoodle combined\r\n\r\n      as i mentioned the word remuneration mr crab first opened his\r\n      eyes and then his mouth to quite a remarkable extent causing\r\n      his personal appearance to resemble that of a highlyagitated\r\n      elderly duck in the act of quacking and in this condition he\r\n      remained ever and anon pressing his hands tightly to his\r\n      forehead as if in a state of desperate bewilderment until i had\r\n      nearly made an end of what i had to say\r\n\r\n      upon my conclusion he sank back into his seat as if much\r\n      overcome letting his arms fall lifelessly by his side but\r\n      keeping his mouth still rigorously open after the fashion of the\r\n      duck while i remained in speechless astonishment at behavior so\r\n      alarming he suddenly leaped to his feet and made a rush at the\r\n      bellrope but just as he reached this he appeared to have\r\n      altered his intention whatever it was for he dived under a\r\n      table and immediately reappeared with a cudgel this he was in\r\n      the act of uplifting for what purpose i am at a loss to\r\n      imagine when all at once there came a benign smile over his\r\n      features and he sank placidly back in his chair\r\n\r\n      mr bob he said for i had sent up my card before ascending\r\n      myself mr bob you are a young man i presumevery\r\n\r\n      i assented adding that i had not yet concluded my third lustrum\r\n\r\n      ah he replied very good i see how it issay no more\r\n      touching this matter of compensation what you observe is very\r\n      just in fact it is excessively so but ahahthe first\r\n      contributionthe first i sayit is never the magazine custom\r\n      to pay foryou comprehend eh the truth is we are usually the\r\n      recipients in such case mr crab smiled blandly as he\r\n      emphasized the word recipients for the most part we are\r\n      paid for the insertion of a maiden attemptespecially in verse\r\n      in the second place mr bob the magazine rule is never to\r\n      disburse what we term in france the argent comptanti have no\r\n      doubt you understand in a quarter or two after publication of\r\n      the articleor in a year or twowe make no objection to giving\r\n      our note at nine months provided always that we can so arrange\r\n      our affairs as to be quite certain of a burst up in six i\r\n      really do hope mr bob that you will look upon this\r\n      explanation as satisfactory here mr crab concluded and the\r\n      tears stood in his eyes\r\n\r\n      grieved to the soul at having been however innocently the cause\r\n      of pain to so eminent and so sensitive a man i hastened to\r\n      apologize and to reassure him by expressing my perfect\r\n      coincidence with his views as well as my entire appreciation of\r\n      the delicacy of his position having done all this in a neat\r\n      speech i took leave\r\n\r\n      one fine morning very shortly afterwards i awoke and found\r\n      myself famous the extent of my renown will be best estimated by\r\n      reference to the editorial opinions of the day these opinions\r\n      it will be seen were embodied in critical notices of the number\r\n      of the lollipop containing my poem and are perfectly\r\n      satisfactory conclusive and clear with the exception perhaps\r\n      of the hieroglyphical marks sep  t appended to each of\r\n      the critiques\r\n\r\n      the owl a journal of profound sagacity and well known for the\r\n      deliberate gravity of its literary decisionsthe owl i say\r\n      spoke as follows\r\n\r\n      the lollipop the october number of this delicious magazine\r\n      surpasses its predecessors and sets competition at defiance in\r\n      the beauty of its typography and paperin the number and\r\n      excellence of its steel platesas well as in the literary merit\r\n      of its contributionsthe lollipop compares with its slowpaced\r\n      rivals as hyperion with a satyr the humdrum the rowdydow\r\n      and the goosetherumfoodle excel it is true in braggadocio\r\n      but in all other points give us the lollipop how this\r\n      celebrated journal can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses\r\n      is more than we can understand to be sure it has a circulation\r\n      of  and its subscriptionlist has increased onefourth\r\n      during the last month but on the other hand the sums it\r\n      disburses constantly for contributions are inconceivable it is\r\n      reported that mr slyass received no less than thirtyseven and a\r\n      half cents for his inimitable paper on pigs with mr crab as\r\n      editor and with such names upon the list of contributors as snob\r\n      and slyass there can be no such word as fail for the\r\n      lollipop go and subscribe sep  t\r\n\r\n      i must say that i was gratified with this hightoned notice from\r\n      a paper so respectable as the owl the placing my namethat is\r\n      to say my nom de guerrein priority of station to that of the\r\n      great slyass was a compliment as happy as i felt it to be\r\n      deserved\r\n\r\n      my attention was next arrested by these paragraphs in the\r\n      toada print highly distinguished for its uprightness and\r\n      independencefor its entire freedom from sycophancy and\r\n      subservience to the givers of dinners\r\n\r\n      the lollipop for october is out in advance of all its\r\n      contemporaries and infinitely surpasses them of course in the\r\n      splendor of its embellishments as well as in the richness of its\r\n      literary contents the humdrum the rowdydow and the\r\n      goosetherumfoodle excel we admit in braggadocio but in all\r\n      other points give us the lollipop how this celebrated magazine\r\n      can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses is more than we\r\n      can understand to be sure it has a circulation of  and\r\n      its subscription list has increased onethird during the last\r\n      fortnight but on the other hand the sums it disburses monthly\r\n      for contributions are fearfully great we learn that mr\r\n      mumblethumb received no less than fifty cents for his late\r\n      monody in a mudpuddle\r\n\r\n      among the original contributors to the present number we notice\r\n      besides the eminent editor mr crab such men as snob slyass\r\n      and mumblethumb apart from the editorial matter the most\r\n      valuable paper nevertheless is we think a poetical gem by\r\n      snob on the oilofbobbut our readers must not suppose from\r\n      the title of this incomparable bijou that it bears any\r\n      similitude to some balderdash on the same subject by a certain\r\n      contemptible individual whose name is unmentionable to ears\r\n      polite the present poem on the oilofbob has excited\r\n      universal anxiety and curiosity in respect to the owner of the\r\n      evident pseudonym snoba curiosity which happily we have it\r\n      in our power to satisfy snob is the nom de plume of mr\r\n      thingum bob of this citya relative of the great mr thingum\r\n      after whom he is named and otherwise connected with the most\r\n      illustrious families of the state his father thomas bob esq\r\n      is an opulent merchant in smug sep  t\r\n\r\n      this generous approbation touched me to the heartthe more\r\n      especially as it emanated from a source so avowedlyso\r\n      proverbially pure as the toad the word balderdash as\r\n      applied to the oilofbob of the fly i considered singularly\r\n      pungent and appropriate the words gem and bijou however\r\n      used in reference to my composition struck me as being in some\r\n      degree feeble and seemed to me to be deficient in force they\r\n      were not sufficiently prononcés as we have it in france\r\n\r\n      i had hardly finished reading the toad when a friend placed in\r\n      my hands a copy of the mole a daily enjoying high reputation\r\n      for the keenness of its perception about matters in general and\r\n      for the open honest aboveground style of its editorials the\r\n      mole spoke of the lollipop as follows\r\n\r\n      we have just received the lollipop for october and must say\r\n      that never before have we perused any single number of any\r\n      periodical which afforded us a felicity so supreme we speak\r\n      advisedly the humdrum the rowdydow and the\r\n      goosetherumfoodle must look well to their laurels these\r\n      prints no doubt surpass every thing in loudness of pretension\r\n      but in all other points give us the lollipop how this\r\n      celebrated magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous\r\n      expenses is more than we can comprehend to be sure it has a\r\n      circulation of  and its subscriptionlist has increased\r\n      onehalf within the last week but then the sum it disburses\r\n      monthly for contributions is astoundingly enormous we have it\r\n      upon good authority that mr fatquack received no less than\r\n      sixtytwo cents and a half for his late domestic nouvelette the\r\n      dishclout\r\n\r\n      the contributors to the number before us are mr crab the\r\n      eminent editor snob mumblethumb fatquack and others but\r\n      after the inimitable compositions of the editor himself we\r\n      prefer a diamondlike effusion from the pen of a rising poet who\r\n      writes over the signature snoba nom de guerre which we predict\r\n      will one day extinguish the radiance of boz snob we learn\r\n      is a mr thingum bob esq sole heir of a wealthy merchant of\r\n      this city thomas bob esq and a near relative of the\r\n      distinguished mr thingum the title of mr bs admirable poem\r\n      is the oilofboba somewhat unfortunate name bytheby as\r\n      some contemptible vagabond connected with the penny press has\r\n      already disgusted the town with a great deal of drivel upon the\r\n      same topic there will be no danger however of confounding the\r\n      compositions sep  t\r\n\r\n      the generous approbation of so clearsighted a journal as the\r\n      mole penetrated my soul with delight the only objection which\r\n      occurred to me was that the terms contemptible vagabond might\r\n      have been better written odious and contemptible wretch\r\n      villain and vagabond this would have sounded more gracefully\r\n      i think diamondlike also was scarcely it will be admitted\r\n      of sufficient intensity to express what the mole evidently\r\n      thought of the brilliancy of the oilofbob\r\n\r\n      on the same afternoon in which i saw these notices in the owl\r\n      the toad and the mole i happened to meet with a copy of the\r\n      daddylonglegs a periodical proverbial for the extreme extent\r\n      of its understanding and it was the daddylonglegs which\r\n      spoke thus\r\n\r\n      the lollipop this gorgeous magazine is already before the\r\n      public for october the question of preeminence is forever put to\r\n      rest and hereafter it will be excessively preposterous in the\r\n      humdrum the rowdydow or the goosetherumfoodle to make\r\n      any farther spasmodic attempts at competition these journals may\r\n      excel the lollipop in outcry but in all other points give us\r\n      the lollipop how this celebrated magazine can sustain its\r\n      evidently tremendous expenses is past comprehension to be sure\r\n      it has a circulation of precisely half a million and its\r\n      subscriptionlist has increased seventyfive per cent within the\r\n      last couple of days but then the sums it disburses monthly for\r\n      contributions are scarcely credible we are cognizant of the\r\n      fact that mademoiselle cribalittle received no less than\r\n      eightyseven cents and a half for her late valuable revolutionary\r\n      tale entitled the yorktown katydid and the bunkerhill\r\n      katydidnt\r\n\r\n      the most able papers in the present number are of course\r\n      those furnished by the editor the eminent mr crab but there\r\n      are numerous magnificent contributions from such names as snob\r\n      mademoiselle cribalittle slyass mrs fibalittle mumblethumb\r\n      mrs squibalittle and last though not least fatquack the\r\n      world may well be challenged to produce so rich a galaxy of\r\n      genius\r\n\r\n      the poem over the signature snob is we find attracting\r\n      universal commendation and we are constrained to say deserves\r\n      if possible even more applause than it has received the\r\n      oilofbob is the title of this masterpiece of eloquence and\r\n      art one or two of our readers may have a very faint\r\n      although sufficiently disgusting recollection of a poem \r\n      similarly entitled the perpetration of a miserable\r\n      pennyaliner mendicant and cutthroat connected in the\r\n      capacity of scullion we believe with one of the indecent prints\r\n      about the purlieus of the city we beg them for gods sake not\r\n      to confound the compositions the author of the oilofbob is\r\n      we hear thingum bob esq a gentleman of high genius and a\r\n      scholar snob is merely a nomdeguerre sept  t\r\n\r\n      i could scarcely restrain my indignation while i perused the\r\n      concluding portions of this diatribe it was clear to me that the\r\n      yeanay mannernot to say the gentlenessthe positive forbearance\r\n      with which the daddylonglegs spoke of that pig the editor of\r\n      the gadflyit was evident to me i say that this gentleness\r\n      of speech could proceed from nothing else than a partiality for\r\n      the flywhom it was clearly the intention of the\r\n      daddylonglegs to elevate into reputation at my expense any\r\n      one indeed might perceive with half an eye that had the real\r\n      design of the daddy been what it wished to appear it the\r\n      daddy might have expressed itself in terms more direct more\r\n      pungent and altogether more to the purpose the words\r\n      pennyaliner mendicant scullion and cutthroat were\r\n      epithets so intentionally inexpressive and equivocal as to be\r\n      worse than nothing when applied to the author of the very worst\r\n      stanzas ever penned by one of the human race we all know what is\r\n      meant by damning with faint praise and on the other hand who\r\n      could fail seeing through the covert purpose of the daddythat\r\n      of glorifying with feeble abuse\r\n\r\n      what the daddy chose to say of the fly however was no\r\n      business of mine what it said of myself was after the noble\r\n      manner in which the owl the toad the mole had expressed\r\n      themselves in respect to my ability it was rather too much to be\r\n      coolly spoken of by a thing like the daddylonglegs as merely\r\n      a gentleman of high genius and a scholar gentleman indeed i\r\n      made up my mind at once either to get a written apology from the\r\n      daddylonglegs or to call it out\r\n\r\n      full of this purpose i looked about me to find a friend whom i\r\n      could entrust with a message to his daddyship and as the editor\r\n      of the lollipop had given me marked tokens of regard i at\r\n      length concluded to seek assistance upon the present occasion\r\n\r\n      i have never yet been able to account in a manner satisfactory\r\n      to my own understanding for the very peculiar countenance and\r\n      demeanor with which mr crab listened to me as i unfolded to him\r\n      my design he again went through the scene of the bellrope and\r\n      cudgel and did not omit the duck at one period i thought he\r\n      really intended to quack his fit nevertheless finally subsided\r\n      as before and he began to act and speak in a rational way he\r\n      declined bearing the cartel however and in fact dissuaded me\r\n      from sending it at all but was candid enough to admit that the\r\n      daddylonglegs had been disgracefully in the wrongmore\r\n      especially in what related to the epithets gentleman and\r\n      scholar\r\n\r\n      towards the end of this interview with mr crab who really\r\n      appeared to take a paternal interest in my welfare he suggested\r\n      to me that i might turn an honest penny and at the same time\r\n      advance my reputation by occasionally playing thomas hawk for\r\n      the lollipop\r\n\r\n      i begged mr crab to inform me who was mr thomas hawk and how\r\n      it was expected that i should play him\r\n\r\n      here mr crab again made great eyes as we say in germany\r\n      but at length recovering himself from a profound attack of\r\n      astonishment he assured me that he employed the words thomas\r\n      hawk to avoid the colloquialism tommy which was lowbut that\r\n      the true idea was tommy hawkor tomahawkand that by playing\r\n      tomahawk he referred to scalping browbeating and otherwise\r\n      usingup the herd of poordevil authors\r\n\r\n      i assured my patron that if this was all i was perfectly\r\n      resigned to the task of playing thomas hawk hereupon mr crab\r\n      desired me to useup the editor of the gadfly forthwith in\r\n      the fiercest style within the scope of my ability and as a\r\n      specimen of my powers this i did upon the spot in a review of\r\n      the original oilofbob occupying thirtysix pages of the\r\n      lollipop i found playing thomas hawk indeed a far less\r\n      onerous occupation than poetizing for i went upon system\r\n      altogether and thus it was easy to do the thing thoroughly and\r\n      well my practice was this i bought auction copies cheap of\r\n      lord broughams speeches cobbetts complete works the new\r\n      slangsyllabus the whole art of snubbing prentices\r\n      billingsgate folio edition and lewis g clarke on tongue\r\n      these works i cut up thoroughly with a currycomb and then\r\n      throwing the shreds into a sieve sifted out carefully all that\r\n      might be thought decent a mere trifle reserving the hard\r\n      phrases which i threw into a large tin peppercastor with\r\n      longitudinal holes so that an entire sentence could get through\r\n      without material injury the mixture was then ready for use when\r\n      called upon to play thomas hawk i anointed a sheet of foolscap\r\n      with the white of a ganders egg then shredding the thing to be\r\n      reviewed as i had previously shredded the booksonly with more\r\n      care so as to get every word separatei threw the latter shreds\r\n      in with the former screwed on the lid of the castor gave it a\r\n      shake and so dusted out the mixture upon the egged foolscap\r\n      where it stuck the effect was beautiful to behold it was\r\n      captivating indeed the reviews i brought to pass by this simple\r\n      expedient have never been approached and were the wonder of the\r\n      world at first through bashfulnessthe result of inexperiencei\r\n      was a little put out by a certain inconsistencya certain air of\r\n      the bizarre as we say in france worn by the composition as\r\n      a whole all the phrases did not fit as we say in the\r\n      anglosaxon many were quite awry some even were\r\n      upsidedown and there were none of them which were not in some\r\n      measure injured in regard to effect by this latter species of\r\n      accident when it occurredwith the exception of mr lewis\r\n      clarkes paragraphs which were so vigorous and altogether\r\n      stout that they seemed not particularly disconcerted by any\r\n      extreme of position but looked equally happy and satisfactory\r\n      whether on their heads or on their heels\r\n\r\n      what became of the editor of the gadfly after the publication\r\n      of my criticism on his oilofbob it is somewhat difficult to\r\n      determine the most reasonable conclusion is that he wept\r\n      himself to death at all events he disappeared instantaneously\r\n      from the face of the earth and no man has seen even the ghost of\r\n      him since\r\n\r\n      this matter having been properly accomplished and the furies\r\n      appeased i grew at once into high favor with mr crab he took\r\n      me into his confidence gave me a permanent situation as thomas\r\n      hawk of the lollipop and as for the present he could afford\r\n      me no salary allowed me to profit at discretion by his advice\r\n\r\n      my dear thingum said he to me one day after dinner i respect\r\n      your abilities and love you as a son you shall be my heir when\r\n      i die i will bequeath you the lollipop in the meantime i will\r\n      make a man of youi willprovided always that you follow my\r\n      counsel the first thing to do is to get rid of the old bore\r\n\r\n      boar said i inquiringlypig ehaper as we say in\r\n      latinwhowhere\r\n\r\n      your father said he\r\n\r\n      precisely i repliedpig\r\n\r\n      you have your fortune to make thingum resumed mr crab and\r\n      that governor of yours is a millstone about your neck we must\r\n      cut him at once here i took out my knife we must cut him\r\n      continued mr crab decidedly and forever he wont dohe\r\n      wont upon second thoughts you had better kick him or cane\r\n      him or something of that kind\r\n\r\n      what do you say i suggested modestly to my kicking him in\r\n      the first instance caning him afterwards and winding up by\r\n      tweaking his nose\r\n\r\n      mr crab looked at me musingly for some moments and then\r\n      answered\r\n\r\n      i think mr bob that what you propose would answer\r\n      sufficiently wellindeed remarkably wellthat is to say as far\r\n      as it wentbut barbers are exceedingly hard to cut and i think\r\n      upon the whole that having performed upon thomas bob the\r\n      operations you suggest it would be advisable to blacken with\r\n      your fists both his eyes very carefully and thoroughly to\r\n      prevent his ever seeing you again in fashionable promenades\r\n      after doing this i really do not perceive that you can do any\r\n      more howeverit might be just as well to roll him once or twice\r\n      in the gutter and then put him in charge of the police any time\r\n      the next morning you can call at the watchhouse and swear an\r\n      assault\r\n\r\n      i was much affected by the kindness of feeling towards me\r\n      personally which was evinced in this excellent advice of mr\r\n      crab and i did not fail to profit by it forthwith the result\r\n      was that i got rid of the old bore and began to feel a little\r\n      independent and gentlemanlike the want of money however was\r\n      for a few weeks a source of some discomfort but at length by\r\n      carefully putting to use my two eyes and observing how matters\r\n      went just in front of my nose i perceived how the thing was to\r\n      be brought about i say thingbe it observedfor they tell me\r\n      the latin for it is rem by the way talking of latin can any\r\n      one tell me the meaning of quocunqueor what is the meaning of\r\n      modo\r\n\r\n      my plan was exceedingly simple i bought for a song a sixteenth\r\n      of the snappingturtlethat was all the thing was done and\r\n      i put money in my purse there were some trivial arrangements\r\n      afterwards to be sure but these formed no portion of the plan\r\n      they were a consequencea result for example i bought pen ink\r\n      and paper and put them into furious activity having thus\r\n      completed a magazine article i gave it for appellation\r\n      follol by the author of the oilofbob and enveloped it\r\n      to the goosetherumfoodle that journal however having\r\n      pronounced it twattle in the monthly notices to\r\n      correspondents i reheaded the paper heydiddlediddle by\r\n      thingum bob esq author of the ode on the oilofbob and\r\n      editor of the snappingturtle with this amendment i\r\n      reenclosed it to the goosetherumfoodle and while i awaited a\r\n      reply published daily in the turtle six columns of what may\r\n      be termed philosophical and analytical investigation of the\r\n      literary merits of the goosetherumfoodle as well as of the\r\n      personal character of the editor of the goosetherumfoodle at\r\n      the end of a week the goosetherumfoodle discovered that it had\r\n      by some odd mistake confounded a stupid article headed\r\n      heydiddlediddle and composed by some unknown ignoramus with\r\n      a gem of resplendent lustre similarly entitled the work of\r\n      thingum bob esq the celebrated author of the oilofbob\r\n      the goosetherumfoodle deeply regretted this very natural\r\n      accident and promised moreover an insertion of the genuine\r\n      heydiddlediddle in the very next number of the magazine\r\n\r\n      the fact is i thoughti really thoughti thought at the\r\n      timei thought thenand have no reason for thinking otherwise\r\n      nowthat the goosetherumfoodle did make a mistake with the\r\n      best intentions in the world i never knew any thing that made as\r\n      many singular mistakes as the goosetherumfoodle from that day\r\n      i took a liking to the goosetherumfoodle and the result was i\r\n      soon saw into the very depths of its literary merits and did not\r\n      fail to expatiate upon them in the turtle whenever a fitting\r\n      opportunity occurred and it is to be regarded as a very peculiar\r\n      coincidenceas one of those positively remarkable coincidences\r\n      which set a man to serious thinkingthat just such a total\r\n      revolution of opinionjust such entire bouleversement as we\r\n      say in frenchjust such thorough topsiturviness if i may be\r\n      permitted to employ a rather forcible term of the choctaws as\r\n      happened pro and con between myself on the one part and\r\n      the goosetherumfoodle on the other did actually again happen\r\n      in a brief period afterwards and with precisely similar\r\n      circumstances in the case of myself and the rowdydow and in\r\n      the case of myself and the humdrum\r\n\r\n      thus it was that by a masterstroke of genius i at length\r\n      consummated my triumphs by putting money in my purse and thus\r\n      may be said really and fairly to have commenced that brilliant\r\n      and eventful career which rendered me illustrious and which now\r\n      enables me to say with chateaubriand i have made\r\n      historyjai fait lhistoire\r\n\r\n      i have indeed made history from the bright epoch which i now\r\n      record my actionsmy worksare the property of mankind they are\r\n      familiar to the world it is then needless for me to detail\r\n      how soaring rapidly i fell heir to the lollipophow i merged\r\n      this journal in the humdrumhow again i made purchase of the\r\n      rowdydow thus combining the three periodicalshow lastly i\r\n      effected a bargain for the sole remaining rival and united all\r\n      the literature of the country in one magnificent magazine known\r\n      everywhere as the\r\n\r\n      rowdydow lollipop humdrum\r\n      and\r\n      goosetherumfoodle\r\n\r\n      yes i have made history my fame is universal it extends to the\r\n      uttermost ends of the earth you cannot take up a common\r\n      newspaper in which you shall not see some allusion to the\r\n      immortal thingum bob it is mr thingum bob said so and mr\r\n      thingum bob wrote this and mr thingum bob did that but i am\r\n      meek and expire with an humble heart after all what is itthis\r\n      indescribable something which men

have been assured that snobbs is a mere corruption of zenobia\r\n      and that zenobia was a queenso am i dr moneypenny always\r\n      calls me the queen of the heartsand that zenobia as well as\r\n      psyche is good greek and that my father was a greek and that\r\n      consequently i have a right to our patronymic which is zenobia\r\n      and not by any means snobbs nobody but tabitha turnip calls me\r\n      suky snobbs i am the signora psyche zenobia\r\n\r\n      as i said before everybody has heard of me i am that very\r\n      signora psyche zenobia so justly celebrated as

dr moneypenny will have\r\n      it that our initials give our true characterbut for my life i\r\n      cant see what he means\r\n\r\n      notwithstanding the good offices of the doctor and the strenuous\r\n      exertions of the association to get itself into notice it met\r\n      with no very great success until i joined it the truth is the\r\n      members indulged in too flippant a tone of discussion the papers\r\n      read every saturday evening were characterized less by depth than\r\n      buffoonery they were all whipped syllabub there was no\r\n      investigation of first causes first principles there was no\r\n      investigation of any thing at all there was no attention paid to\r\n      that great point the fitness of things in short there was no\r\n      fine writing like this it was all lowvery no profundity no\r\n      reading no metaphysicsnothing which the learned call\r\n      spirituality and which the unlearned choose to stigmatize as\r\n      cant dr m says i ought to spell cant with a capital kbut i\r\n      know better\r\n\r\n      when i joined the society it was my endeavor to introduce a\r\n      better style of thinking and writing and all the world knows how\r\n      well i have succeeded we get up as good papers now in the p r\r\n      e t t y b l u e b a t c h as any to be found even in\r\n      blackwood i say blackwood because i have been assured that the\r\n      finest writing upon every subject is to be discovered in the\r\n      pages of that justly celebrated magazine we now take it for our\r\n      model upon all themes and are getting into rapid notice\r\n      accordingly and after all its not so very difficult a matter\r\n      to compose an article of the genuine blackwood stamp if one only\r\n      goes properly about it of course i dont speak of the political\r\n      articles everybody knows how they are managed since dr\r\n      moneypenny explained it mr blackwood has a pair of\r\n      tailorsshears and three apprentices who stand by him for\r\n      orders one hands him the times another the examiner and a\r\n      third a culleys new compendium of slangwhang mr b merely\r\n      cuts out and intersperses it is soon donenothing but\r\n      examiner slangwhang and timesthen times\r\n      slangwhang and examinerand then times examiner and\r\n      slangwhang\r\n\r\n      but the chief merit of the magazine lies in its miscellaneous\r\n      articles and the best of these come under the head of what dr\r\n      moneypenny calls the bizarreries whatever that may mean and\r\n      what everybody else calls the intensities this is a species of\r\n      writing which i have long known how to appreciate although it is\r\n      only since my late visit to mr blackwood deputed by the\r\n      society that i have been made aware of the exact method of\r\n      composition this method is very simple but not so much so as\r\n      the politics upon my calling at mr bs and making known to\r\n      him the wishes of the society he received me with great\r\n      civility took me into his study and gave me a clear explanation\r\n      of the whole process\r\n\r\n      my dear madam said he evidently struck with my majestic\r\n      appearance for i had on the crimson satin with the green\r\n      agraffas and orangecolored auriclas my dear madam said he\r\n      sit down the matter stands thus in the first place your writer\r\n      of intensities must have very black ink and a very big pen with\r\n      a very blunt nib and mark me miss psyche zenobia he\r\n      continued after a pause with the most expressive energy and\r\n      solemnity of manner mark methat penmustnever be mended\r\n      herein madam lies the secret the soul of intensity i assume\r\n      upon myself to say that no individual of however great genius\r\n      ever wrote with a good penunderstand mea good article you may\r\n      take it for granted that when manuscript can be read it is\r\n      never worth reading this is a leading principle in our faith to\r\n      which if you cannot readily assent our conference is at an end\r\n\r\n      he paused but of course as i had no wish to put an end to the\r\n      conference i assented to a proposition so very obvious and one\r\n      too of whose truth i had all along been sufficiently aware he\r\n      seemed pleased and went on with his instructions\r\n\r\n      it may appear invidious in me miss psyche zenobia to refer you\r\n      to any article or set of articles in the way of model or study\r\n      yet perhaps i may as well call your attention to a few cases let\r\n      me see there was the dead alive a capital thingthe record\r\n      of a gentlemans sensations when entombed before the breath was\r\n      out of his bodyfull of tastes terror sentiment metaphysics\r\n      and erudition you would have sworn that the writer had been born\r\n      and brought up in a coffin then we had the confessions of an\r\n      opiumeaterfine very fineglorious imaginationdeep\r\n      philosophy acute speculationplenty of fire and fury and a good\r\n      spicing of the decidedly unintelligible that was a nice bit of\r\n      flummery and went down the throats of the people delightfully\r\n      they would have it that coleridge wrote the paperbut not so it\r\n      was composed by my pet baboon juniper over a rummer of hollands\r\n      and water hot without sugar this i could scarcely have\r\n      believed had it been anybody but mr blackwood who assured me of\r\n      it then there was the involuntary experimentalist all about\r\n      a gentleman who got baked in an oven and came out alive and\r\n      well although certainly done to a turn and then there was the\r\n      diary of a late physician where the merit lay in good rant and\r\n      indifferent greekboth of them taking things with the public and\r\n      then there was the man in the bell a paper bytheby miss\r\n      zenobia which i cannot sufficiently recommend to your attention\r\n      it is the history of a young person who goes to sleep under the\r\n      clapper of a church bell and is awakened by its tolling for a\r\n      funeral the sound drives him mad and accordingly pulling out\r\n      his tablets he gives a record of his sensations sensations are\r\n      the great things after all should you ever be drowned or hung\r\n      be sure and make a note of your sensationsthey will be worth to\r\n      you ten guineas a sheet if you wish to write forcibly miss\r\n      zenobia pay minute attention to the sensations\r\n\r\n      that i certainly will mr blackwood said i\r\n\r\n      good he replied i see you are a pupil after my own heart\r\n      but i must put you au fait to the details necessary in composing\r\n      what may be denominated a genuine blackwood article of the\r\n      sensation stampthe kind which you will understand me to say i\r\n      consider the best for all purposes\r\n\r\n      the first thing requisite is to get yourself into such a scrape\r\n      as no one ever got into before the oven for instancethat was\r\n      a good hit but if you have no oven or big bell at hand and if\r\n      you cannot conveniently tumble out of a balloon or be swallowed\r\n      up in an earthquake or get stuck fast in a chimney you will\r\n      have to be contented with simply imagining some similar\r\n      misadventure i should prefer however that you have the actual\r\n      fact to bear you out nothing so well assists the fancy as an\r\n      experimental knowledge of the matter in hand truth is strange\r\n      you know stranger than fictionbesides being more to the\r\n      purpose\r\n\r\n      here i assured him i had an excellent pair of garters and would\r\n      go and hang myself forthwith\r\n\r\n      good he replied do soalthough hanging is somewhat\r\n      hacknied perhaps you might do better take a dose of brandreths\r\n      pills and then give us your sensations however my instructions\r\n      will apply equally well to any variety of misadventure and in\r\n      your way home you may easily get knocked in the head or run over\r\n      by an omnibus or bitten by a mad dog or drowned in a gutter\r\n      but to proceed\r\n\r\n      having determined upon your subject you must next consider the\r\n      tone or manner of your narration there is the tone didactic\r\n      the tone enthusiastic the tone naturalall commonplace enough\r\n      but then there is the tone laconic or curt which has lately\r\n      come much into use it consists in short sentences somehow thus\r\n      cant be too brief cant be too snappish always a full stop\r\n      and never a paragraph\r\n\r\n      then there is the tone elevated diffusive and interjectional\r\n      some of our best novelists patronize this tone the words must be\r\n      all in a whirl like a hummingtop and make a noise very\r\n      similar which answers remarkably well instead of meaning this\r\n      is the best of all possible styles where the writer is in too\r\n      great a hurry to think\r\n\r\n      the tone metaphysical is also a good one if you know any big\r\n      words this is your chance for them talk of the ionic and eleatic\r\n      schoolsof archytas gorgias and alcmaeon say something about\r\n      objectivity and subjectivity be sure and abuse a man named\r\n      locke turn up your nose at things in general and when you let\r\n      slip any thing a little too absurd you need not be at the\r\n      trouble of scratching it out but just add a footnote and say\r\n      that you are indebted for the above profound observation to the\r\n      kritik der reinem vernunft or to the metaphysithe\r\n      anfongsgrunde der noturwissenchaft this would look erudite\r\n      andandand frank\r\n\r\n      there are various other tones of equal celebrity but i shall\r\n      mention only two morethe tone transcendental and the tone\r\n      heterogeneous in the former the merit consists in seeing into\r\n      the nature of affairs a very great deal farther than anybody\r\n      else this second sight is very efficient when properly managed\r\n      a little reading of the dial will carry you a great way\r\n      eschew in this case big words get them as small as possible\r\n      and write them upside down look over channings poems and quote\r\n      what he says about a fat little man with a delusive show of\r\n      can put in something about the supernal oneness dont say a\r\n      syllable about the infernal twoness above all study innuendo\r\n      hint everythingassert nothing if you feel inclined to say\r\n      bread and butter do not by any means say it outright you may\r\n      say any thing and every thing approaching to bread and butter\r\n      you may hint at buckwheat cake or you may even go so far as to\r\n      insinuate oatmeal porridge but if bread and butter be your real\r\n      meaning be cautious my dear miss psyche not on any account to\r\n      say bread and butter\r\n\r\n      i assured him that i should never say it again as long as i\r\n      lived he kissed me and continued\r\n\r\n      as for the tone heterogeneous it is merely a judicious mixture\r\n      in equal proportions of all the other tones in the world and is\r\n      consequently made up of every thing deep great odd piquant\r\n      pertinent and pretty\r\n\r\n      let us suppose now you have determined upon your incidents and\r\n      tone the most important

adapted to the vast\r\n      character of the article i intended to write in this excursion i\r\n      was attended by one negro servant pompey and my little lapdog\r\n      diana whom i had brought with me from philadelphia it was not\r\n      however until late in the afternoon that i fully succeeded in my\r\n      arduous undertaking an important event then happened of which\r\n      the following blackwood article in the tone heterogeneous is\r\n      the substance and result\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na predicament\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat chance good lady hath bereft you thuscomus\r\n\r\n      it was a quiet and still afternoon when i strolled forth in the\r\n      goodly city of edina the confusion and bustle in the streets\r\n      were terrible men were talking women were screaming children\r\n      were choking pigs were whistling carts they rattled bulls they\r\n      bellowed cows they lowed horses they neighed cats they\r\n      caterwauled dogs they danced danced could it then be\r\n      possible danced alas thought i my dancing days are over thus\r\n      it is ever what a host of gloomy recollections will ever and\r\n      anon be awakened in the mind of genius and imaginative\r\n      contemplation especially of a genius doomed to the everlasting\r\n      and eternal and continual and as one might say\r\n      thecontinuedyes the continued and continuous bitter\r\n      harassing disturbing and if i may be allowed the expression\r\n      the very disturbing influence of the serene and godlike and\r\n      heavenly and exalted and elevated and purifying effect of what\r\n      may be rightly termed the most enviable the most truly\r\n      enviablenay the most benignly beautiful the most deliciously\r\n      ethereal and as it were the most pretty if i may use so bold\r\n      an expression thing pardon me gentle reader in the worldbut\r\n      i am always led away by my feelings in such a mind i repeat\r\n      what a host of

recollection of the classical reader that exquisite passage in\r\n      relation to the fitness of things which is to be found in the\r\n      commencement of the third volume of that admirable and venerable\r\n      chinese novel the jogoslow\r\n\r\n      in my solitary walk through the city i had two humble but\r\n      faithful companions diana my poodle sweetest of creatures she\r\n      had a quantity of hair over her one eye and a blue ribbon tied\r\n      fashionably around her neck diana was not more than five inches\r\n      in height but her head was somewhat bigger than her body and\r\n      her tail being cut off exceedingly close gave an air of injured\r\n      innocence to the interesting animal which rendered her a favorite\r\n      with all\r\n\r\n      and pompey my negrosweet pompey how shall i ever forget thee\r\n      i had taken pompeys arm he was three feet in height i like to\r\n      be particular and about seventy or perhaps eighty years of\r\n      age he had bowlegs and was corpulent his mouth should not be\r\n      called small nor his ears short his teeth however were like\r\n      pearl and his large full eyes were deliciously white nature had\r\n      endowed him with no neck and had placed his ankles as usual\r\n      with that race in the middle of the upper portion of the feet\r\n      he was clad with a striking simplicity his sole garments were a\r\n      stock of nine inches in height and a nearlynew drab overcoat\r\n      which had formerly been in the service of the tall stately and\r\n      illustrious dr moneypenny it was a good overcoat it was well\r\n      cut it was well made the coat was nearly new pompey held it up\r\n      out of the dirt with both hands\r\n\r\n      there were three persons in our party and two of them have\r\n      already been the subject of remark there was a thirdthat person\r\n      was myself i am the signora psyche zenobia i am not suky\r\n      snobbs my appearance is commanding on the memorable occasion of\r\n      which i speak i was habited in a crimson satin dress with a\r\n      skyblue arabian mantelet and the dress had trimmings of green\r\n      agraffas and seven graceful flounces of the orangecolored\r\n      auricula i thus formed the third of the party there was the\r\n      poodle there was pompey there was myself we were three thus\r\n      it is said there were originally but three furiesmelty nimmy\r\n      and hettymeditation memory and fiddling\r\n\r\n      leaning upon the arm of the gallant pompey and attended at a\r\n      respectable distance by diana i proceeded down one of the\r\n      populous and very pleasant streets of the now deserted edina on\r\n      a sudden there presented itself to view a churcha gothic\r\n      cathedralvast venerable and with a tall steeple which towered\r\n      into the sky what madness now possessed me why did i rush upon\r\n      my fate i was seized with an uncontrollable desire to ascend the\r\n      giddy pinnacle and then survey the immense extent of the city\r\n      the door of the cathedral stood invitingly open my destiny\r\n      prevailed i entered the ominous archway where then was my\r\n      guardian angelif indeed such angels there be if distressing\r\n      monosyllable what world of mystery and meaning and doubt and\r\n      uncertainty is there involved in thy two letters i entered the\r\n      ominous archway i entered and without injury to my\r\n      orangecolored auriculas i passed beneath the portal and\r\n      emerged within the vestibule thus it is said the immense river\r\n      alfred passed unscathed and unwetted beneath the sea\r\n\r\n      i thought the staircase would never have an end round yes they\r\n      went round and up and round and up and round and up until i\r\n      could not help surmising with the sagacious pompey upon whose\r\n      supporting arm i leaned in all the confidence of early\r\n      affectioni could not help surmising that the upper end of the\r\n      continuous spiral ladder had been accidentally or perhaps\r\n      designedly removed i paused for breath and in the meantime\r\n      an accident occurred of too momentous a nature in a moral and\r\n      also in a metaphysical point of view to be passed over without\r\n      notice it appeared to meindeed i was quite confident of the\r\n      facti could not be mistakenno i had for some moments\r\n      carefully and anxiously observed the motions of my dianai say\r\n      that i could not be mistakendiana smelt a rat at once i called\r\n      pompeys attention to the subject and hehe agreed with me\r\n      there was then no longer any reasonable room for doubt the rat\r\n      had been smelledand by diana heavens shall i ever forget the\r\n      intense excitement of the moment alas what is the boasted\r\n      intellect of man the ratit was therethat is to say it was\r\n      somewhere diana smelled the rat ii could not thus it is said\r\n      the prussian isis has for some persons a sweet and very\r\n      powerful perfume while to others it is perfectly scentless\r\n\r\n      the staircase had been surmounted and there were now only three\r\n      or four more upward steps intervening between us and the summit\r\n      we still ascended and now only one step remained one step one\r\n      little little step upon one such little step in the great\r\n      staircase of human life how vast a sum of human happiness or\r\n      misery depends i thought of myself then of pompey and then of\r\n      the mysterious and inexplicable destiny which surrounded us i\r\n      thought of pompeyalas i thought of love i thought of my many\r\n      false steps which have been taken and may be taken again i\r\n      resolved to be more cautious more reserved i abandoned the arm\r\n      of pompey and without his assistance surmounted the one\r\n      remaining step and gained the chamber of the belfry i was\r\n      followed immediately afterward by my poodle pompey alone\r\n      remained behind i stood at the head of the staircase and\r\n      encouraged him to ascend he stretched forth to me his hand and\r\n      unfortunately in so doing was forced to abandon his firm hold\r\n      upon the overcoat will the gods never cease their persecution\r\n      the overcoat is dropped and with one of his feet pompey\r\n      stepped upon the long and trailing skirt of the overcoat he\r\n      stumbled and fellthis consequence was inevitable he fell\r\n      forward and with his accursed head striking me full in thein\r\n      the breast precipitated me headlong together with himself upon\r\n      the hard filthy and detestable floor of the belfry but my\r\n      revenge was sure sudden and complete seizing him furiously by\r\n      the wool with both hands i tore out a vast quantity of black\r\n      and crisp and curling material and tossed it from me with every\r\n      manifestation of disdain it fell among the ropes of the belfry\r\n      and remained pompey arose and said no word but he regarded me\r\n      piteously with his large eyes andsighed ye godsthat sigh it\r\n      sunk into my heart and the hairthe wool could i have reached\r\n      that wool i would have bathed it with my tears in testimony of\r\n      regret but alas it was now far beyond my grasp as it dangled\r\n      among the cordage of the bell i fancied it alive i fancied that\r\n      it stood on end with indignation thus the happydandy flos aeris\r\n      of java bears it is said a beautiful flower which will live\r\n      when pulled up by the roots the natives suspend it by a cord\r\n      from the ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years\r\n\r\n      our quarrel was now made up and we looked about the room for an\r\n      aperture through which to survey the city of edina windows there\r\n      were none the sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber\r\n      proceeded from a square opening about a foot in diameter at a\r\n      height of about seven feet from the floor yet what will the\r\n      energy of true genius not effect i resolved to clamber up to\r\n      this hole a vast quantity of wheels pinions and other\r\n      cabalisticlooking machinery stood opposite the hole close to\r\n      it and through the hole there passed an iron rod from the\r\n      machinery between the wheels and the wall where the hole lay\r\n      there was barely room for my bodyyet i was desperate and\r\n      determined to persevere i called pompey to my side\r\n\r\n      you perceive that aperture pompey i wish to look through it\r\n      you will stand here just beneath the holeso now hold out one\r\n      of your hands pompey and let me step upon itthus now the\r\n      other hand pompey and with its aid i will get upon your\r\n      shoulders\r\n\r\n      he did every thing i wished and i found upon getting up that i\r\n      could easily pass my head and neck through the aperture the\r\n      prospect was sublime nothing could be more magnificent i merely\r\n      paused a moment to bid diana behave herself and assure pompey\r\n      that i would be considerate and bear as lightly as possible upon\r\n      his shoulders i told him i would be tender of his feelingsossi\r\n      tender que beefsteak having done this justice to my faithful\r\n      friend i gave myself up with great zest and enthusiasm to the\r\n      enjoyment of the scene which so obligingly spread itself out\r\n      before my eyes\r\n\r\n      upon this subject however i shall forbear to dilate i will not\r\n      describe the city of edinburgh every one has been to the city of\r\n      edinburgh every one has been to edinburghthe classic edina i\r\n      will confine myself to the momentous details of my own lamentable\r\n      adventure having in some measure satisfied my curiosity in\r\n      regard to the extent situation and general appearance of the\r\n      city i had leisure to survey the church in which i was and the\r\n      delicate architecture of the steeple i observed that the\r\n      aperture through which i had thrust my head was an opening in the\r\n      dialplate of a gigantic clock and must have appeared from the\r\n      street as a large keyhole such as we see in the face of the\r\n      french watches no doubt the true object was to admit the arm of\r\n      an attendant to adjust when necessary the hands of the clock\r\n      from within i observed also with surprise the immense size of\r\n      these hands the longest of which could not have been less than\r\n      ten feet in length and where broadest eight or nine inches in\r\n      breadth they were of solid steel apparently and their edges\r\n      appeared to be sharp having noticed these particulars and some\r\n      others i again turned my eyes upon the glorious prospect below\r\n      and soon became absorbed in contemplation\r\n\r\n      from this after some minutes i was aroused by the voice of\r\n      pompey who declared that he could stand it no longer and\r\n      requested that i would be so kind as to come down this was\r\n      unreasonable and i told him so in a speech of some length he\r\n      replied but with an evident misunderstanding of my ideas upon\r\n      the subject i accordingly grew angry and told him in plain\r\n      words that he was a fool that he had committed an ignoramus\r\n      eclencheye that his notions were mere insommary bovis and his\r\n      words little better than an ennemywerryborem with this he\r\n      appeared satisfied and i resumed my contemplations\r\n\r\n      it might have been half an hour after this altercation when as i\r\n      was deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery beneath me i was\r\n      startled by something very cold which pressed with a gentle\r\n      pressure on the back of my neck it is needless to say that i\r\n      felt inexpressibly alarmed i knew that pompey was beneath my\r\n      feet and that diana was sitting according to my explicit\r\n      directions upon her hind legs in the farthest corner of the\r\n      room what could it be alas i but too soon discovered turning\r\n      my head gently to one side i perceived to my extreme horror\r\n      that the huge glittering scimetarlike minutehand of the clock\r\n      had in the course of its hourly revolution descended upon my\r\n      neck there was i knew not a second to be lost i pulled back\r\n      at oncebut it was too late there was no chance of forcing my\r\n      head through the mouth of that terrible trap in which it was so\r\n      fairly caught and which grew narrower and narrower with a\r\n      rapidity too horrible to be conceived the agony of that moment\r\n      is not to be imagined i threw up my hands and endeavored with\r\n      all my strength to force upward the ponderous iron bar i might\r\n      as well have tried to lift the cathedral itself down down down\r\n      it came closer and yet closer i screamed to pompey for aid but\r\n      he said that i had hurt his feelings by calling him an ignorant\r\n      old squinteye i yelled to diana but she only said\r\n      bowwowwow and that i had told her on no account to stir\r\n      from the corner thus i had no relief to expect from my\r\n      associates\r\n\r\n      meantime the ponderous and terrific scythe of time for i now\r\n      discovered the literal import of that classical phrase had not\r\n      stopped nor was it likely to stop in its career down and still\r\n      down it came it had already buried its sharp edge a full inch\r\n      in my flesh and my sensations grew indistinct and confused at\r\n      one time i fancied myself in philadelphia with the stately dr\r\n      moneypenny at another in the back parlor of mr blackwood\r\n      receiving his invaluable instructions and then again the sweet\r\n      recollection of better and earlier times came over me and i\r\n      thought of that happy period when the world was not all a desert\r\n      and pompey not altogether cruel\r\n\r\n      the ticking of the machinery amused me amused me i say for my\r\n      sensations now bordered upon perfect happiness and the most\r\n      trifling circumstances afforded me pleasure the eternal\r\n      clickclak clickclak clickclak of the clock was the most\r\n      melodious of music in my ears and occasionally even put me in\r\n      mind of the graceful sermonic harangues of dr ollapod then\r\n      there were the great figures upon the dialplatehow intelligent\r\n      how intellectual they all looked and presently they took to\r\n      dancing the mazurka and i think it was the figure v who\r\n      performed the most to my satisfaction she was evidently a lady\r\n      of breeding none of your swaggerers and nothing at all\r\n      indelicate in her motions she did the pirouette to\r\n      admirationwhirling round upon her apex i made an endeavor to\r\n      hand her a chair for i saw that she appeared fatigued with her\r\n      exertionsand it was not until then that i fully perceived my\r\n      lamentable situation lamentable indeed the bar had buried\r\n      itself two inches in my neck i was aroused to a sense of\r\n      exquisite pain i prayed for death and in the agony of the\r\n      moment could not help repeating those exquisite verses of the\r\n      poet miguel de cervantes\r\n\r\n     vanny buren tan escondida\r\n     query no te senty venny\r\n     pork and pleasure delly morry\r\n     nommy torny darry widdy\r\n\r\n      but now a new horror presented itself and one indeed sufficient\r\n      to startle the strongest nerves my eyes from the cruel pressure\r\n      of the machine were absolutely starting from their sockets\r\n      while i was thinking how i should possibly manage without them\r\n      one actually tumbled out of my head and rolling down the steep\r\n      side of the steeple lodged in the rain gutter which ran along\r\n      the eaves of the main building the loss of the eye was not so\r\n      much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which\r\n      it regarded me after it was out there it lay in the gutter just\r\n      under my nose and the airs it gave itself would have been\r\n      ridiculous had they not been disgusting such a winking and\r\n      blinking were never before seen this behavior on the part of my\r\n      eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its\r\n      manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude but was also\r\n      exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which always\r\n      exists between two eyes of the same head however far apart i\r\n      was forced in a manner to wink and to blink whether i would or\r\n      not in exact concert with the scoundrelly thing that lay just\r\n      under my nose i was presently relieved however by the dropping\r\n      out of the other eye in falling it took the same direction\r\n      possibly a concerted plot as its fellow both rolled out of the\r\n      gutter together and in truth i was very glad to get rid of them\r\n\r\n      the bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck and there\r\n      was only a little bit of skin to cut through my sensations were\r\n      those of entire happiness for i felt that in a few minutes at\r\n      farthest i should be relieved from my disagreeable situation\r\n      and in this expectation i was not at all deceived at twentyfive\r\n      minutes past five in the afternoon precisely the huge\r\n      minutehand had proceeded sufficiently far on its terrible\r\n      revolution to sever the small remainder of my neck i was not\r\n      sorry to see the head which had occasioned me so much\r\n      embarrassment at length make a final separation from my body it\r\n      first rolled down the side of the steeple then lodge for a few\r\n      seconds in the gutter and then made its way with a plunge\r\n      into the middle of the street\r\n\r\n      i will candidly confess that my feelings were now of the most\r\n      singularnay of the most mysterious the most perplexing and\r\n      incomprehensible character my senses were here and there at one\r\n      and the same moment with my head i imagined at one time that\r\n      i the head was the real signora psyche zenobiaat another i\r\n      felt convinced that myself the body was the proper identity to\r\n      clear my ideas on this topic i felt in my pocket for my\r\n      snuffbox but upon getting it and endeavoring to apply a pinch\r\n      of its grateful contents in the ordinary manner i became\r\n      immediately aware of my peculiar deficiency and threw the box at\r\n      once down to my head it took a pinch with great satisfaction\r\n      and smiled me an acknowledgement in return shortly afterward it\r\n      made me a speech which i could hear but indistinctly without\r\n      ears i gathered enough however to know that it was astonished\r\n      at my wishing to remain alive under such circumstances in the\r\n      concluding sentences it quoted the noble words of ariosto\r\n\r\n     il pover hommy che non sera corty\r\n      and have a combat tenty erry morty\r\n\r\n      thus comparing me to the hero who in the heat of the combat not\r\n      perceiving that he was dead continued to contest the battle with\r\n      inextinguishable valor there was nothing now to prevent my\r\n      getting down from my elevation and i did so what it was that\r\n      pompey saw so very peculiar in my appearance i have never yet\r\n      been able to find out the fellow opened his mouth from ear to\r\n      ear and shut his two eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack\r\n      nuts between the lids finally throwing off his overcoat he\r\n      made one spring for the staircase and disappeared i hurled after\r\n      the scoundrel these vehement words of demosthenes\r\n\r\n      andrew ophlegethon you really make haste to fly\r\n\r\n      and then turned to the darling of my heart to the oneeyed the\r\n      shaggyhaired diana alas what a horrible vision affronted my\r\n

baron ritzner von jung was a noble hungarian family every\r\n      member of which at least as far back into antiquity as any\r\n      certain records extend was more or less remarkable for talent of\r\n      some descriptionthe majority for that species of grotesquerie\r\n      in conception of which tieck a scion of the house has given a\r\n      vivid although by no means the most vivid exemplifications my\r\n      acquaintance with ritzner commenced at the magnificent chateau\r\n      jung into which a train of droll adventures not to be made\r\n      public threw me during the summer months of the year  here\r\n      it was that i obtained a place in his regard and here with\r\n      somewhat more difficulty a partial insight into his mental\r\n      conformation in later days this insight grew more clear as the\r\n      intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close and\r\n      when after three years separation we met at gn i knew all\r\n      that it was necessary to know of the character of the baron\r\n      ritzner von jung\r\n\r\n      i remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within\r\n      the college precincts on the night of the twentyfifth of june i\r\n      remember still more distinctly that while he was pronounced by\r\n      all parties at first sight the most remarkable man in the\r\n      world no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion\r\n      that he was unique appeared so undeniable that it was deemed\r\n      impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted but\r\n      letting this matter pass for the present i will merely observe\r\n      that from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits\r\n      of the university he began to exercise over the habits manners\r\n      persons purses and propensities of the whole community which\r\n      surrounded him an influence the most extensive and despotic yet\r\n      at the same time the most indefinite and altogether\r\n      unaccountable thus the brief period of his residence at the\r\n      university forms an era in its annals and is characterized by\r\n      all classes of people appertaining to it or its dependencies as\r\n      that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the\r\n      baron ritzner von jung\r\n\r\n      upon his advent to gn he sought me out in my apartments he\r\n      was then of no particular age by which i mean that it was\r\n      impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data\r\n      personally afforded he might have been fifteen or fifty and was\r\n      twentyone years and seven months he was by no means a handsome\r\n      manperhaps the reverse the contour of his face was somewhat\r\n      angular and harsh his forehead was lofty and very fair his nose\r\n      a snub his eyes large heavy glassy and meaningless about the\r\n      mouth there was more to be observed the lips were gently\r\n      protruded and rested the one upon the other after such a\r\n      fashion that it is impossible to conceive any even the most\r\n      complex combination of human features conveying so entirely\r\n      and so singly the idea of unmitigated gravity solemnity and\r\n      repose\r\n\r\n      it will be perceived no doubt from what i have already said\r\n      that the baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to\r\n      be found who make the science of mystification the study and the\r\n      business of their lives for this science a peculiar turn of mind\r\n      gave him instinctively the cue while his physical appearance\r\n      afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into\r\n      effect i firmly believe that no student at gn during that\r\n      renowned epoch so quaintly termed the domination of the baron\r\n      ritzner von jung ever rightly entered into the mystery which\r\n      overshadowed his character i truly think that no person at the\r\n      university with the exception of myself ever suspected him to\r\n      be capable of a joke verbal or practicalthe old bulldog at\r\n      the gardengate would sooner have been accusedthe ghost of\r\n      heraclitusor the wig of the emeritus professor of theology\r\n      this too when it was evident that the most egregious and\r\n      unpardonable of all conceivable tricks whimsicalities and\r\n      buffooneries were brought about if not directly by him at least\r\n      plainly through his intermediate agency or connivance the\r\n      beauty if i may so call it of his art mystifique lay in that\r\n      consummate ability resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge\r\n      of human nature and a most wonderful selfpossession by means\r\n      of which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries he\r\n      was occupied in bringing to a point arose partly in spite and\r\n      partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for\r\n      their prevention and for the preservation of the good order and\r\n      dignity of alma mater the deep the poignant the overwhelming\r\n      mortification which upon each such failure of his praise worthy\r\n      endeavors would suffuse every lineament of his countenance left\r\n      not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms\r\n      of even his most skeptical companions the adroitness too was\r\n      no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the\r\n      sense of the grotesque from the creator to the createdfrom his\r\n      own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise in no\r\n      instance before that of which i speak have i known the habitual\r\n      mystific escape the natural consequence of his manoevresan\r\n      attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person\r\n      continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim my friend\r\n      appeared to live only for the severities of society and not even\r\n      his own household have for a moment associated other ideas than\r\n      those of the rigid and august with the memory of the baron\r\n      ritzner von jung\r\n\r\n      during the epoch of his residence at gn it really appeared that\r\n      the demon of the dolce far niente lay like an incubus upon the\r\n      university nothing at least was done beyond eating and\r\n      drinking and making merry the apartments of the students were\r\n      converted into so many pothouses and there was no pothouse of\r\n      them all more famous or more frequented than that of the baron\r\n      our carousals here were many and boisterous and long and never\r\n      unfruitful of events\r\n\r\n      upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly\r\n      daybreak and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk the\r\n      company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the baron\r\n      and myself most of these were young men of wealth of high\r\n      connection of great family pride and all alive with an\r\n      exaggerated sense of honor they abounded in the most ultra\r\n      german opinions respecting the duello to these quixotic notions\r\n      some recent parisian publications backed by three or four\r\n      desperate and fatal rencounters at gn had given new vigor and\r\n      impulse and thus the conversation during the greater part of\r\n      the night had run wild upon the allengrossing topic of the\r\n      times the baron who had been unusually silent and abstracted in\r\n      the earlier portion of the evening at length seemed to be\r\n      aroused from his apathy took a leading part in the discourse\r\n      and dwelt upon the benefits and more especially upon the\r\n      beauties of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms\r\n      with an ardor an eloquence an impressiveness and an\r\n      affectionateness of manner which elicited the warmest enthusiasm\r\n      from his hearers in general and absolutely staggered even\r\n      myself who well knew him to be at heart a ridiculer of those\r\n      very points for which he contended and especially to hold the\r\n      entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign\r\n      contempt which it deserves\r\n\r\n      looking around me during a pause in the barons discourse of\r\n      which my readers may gather some faint idea when i say that it\r\n      bore resemblance to the fervid chanting monotonous yet musical\r\n      sermonic manner of coleridge i perceived symptoms of even more\r\n      than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party\r\n      this gentleman whom i shall call hermann was an original in\r\n      every respectexcept perhaps in the single particular that he\r\n      was a very great fool he contrived to bear however among a\r\n      particular set at the university a reputation for deep\r\n      metaphysical thinking and i believe for some logical talent\r\n      as a duellist he had acquired great renown even at gn i\r\n      forget the precise number of victims who had fallen at his hands\r\n      but they were many he was a man of courage undoubtedly but it\r\n      was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the\r\n      duello and the nicety of his sense of honor that he most\r\n      especially prided himself these things were a hobby which he\r\n      rode to the death to ritzner ever upon the lookout for the\r\n      grotesque his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded\r\n      food for mystification of this however i was not aware\r\n      although in the present instance i saw clearly that something\r\n      of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend and that\r\n      hermann was its especial object\r\n\r\n      as the former proceeded in his discourse or rather monologue i\r\n      perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing at\r\n      length he spoke offering some objection to a point insisted upon\r\n      by r and giving his reasons in detail to these the baron\r\n      replied at length still maintaining his exaggerated tone of\r\n      sentiment and concluding in what i thought very bad taste with\r\n      a sarcasm and a sneer the hobby of hermann now took the bit in\r\n      his teeth this i could discern by the studied hairsplitting\r\n      farrago of his rejoinder his last words i distinctly remember\r\n      your opinions allow me to say baron von jung although in the\r\n      main correct are in many nice points discreditable to yourself\r\n      and to the university of which you are a member in a few\r\n      respects they are even unworthy of serious refutation i would\r\n      say more than this sir were it not for the fear of giving you\r\n      offence here the speaker smiled blandly i would say sir that\r\n      your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a\r\n      gentleman\r\n\r\n      as hermann completed this equivocal sentence all eyes were\r\n      turned upon the baron he became pale then excessively red\r\n      then dropping his pockethandkerchief stooped to recover it\r\n      when i caught a glimpse of his countenance while it could be\r\n      seen by no one else at the table it was radiant with the\r\n      quizzical expression which was its natural character but which i\r\n      had never seen it assume except when we were alone together and\r\n      when he unbent himself freely in an instant afterward he stood\r\n      erect confronting hermann and so total an alteration of\r\n      countenance in so short a period i certainly never saw before\r\n      for a moment i even fancied that i had misconceived him and that\r\n      he was in sober earnest he appeared to be stifling with passion\r\n      and his face was cadaverously white for a short time he remained\r\n      silent apparently striving to master his emotion having at\r\n      length seemingly succeeded he reached a decanter which stood\r\n      near him saying as he held it firmly clenchedthe language you\r\n      have thought proper to employ mynheer hermann in addressing\r\n      yourself to me is objectionable in so many particulars that i\r\n      have neither temper nor time for specification that my opinions\r\n      however are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman is\r\n      an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line\r\n      of conduct some courtesy nevertheless is due to the presence\r\n      of this company and to yourself at this moment as my guest\r\n      you will pardon me therefore if upon this consideration i\r\n      deviate slightly from the general usage among gentlemen in\r\n      similar cases of personal affront you will forgive me for the\r\n      moderate tax i shall make upon your imagination and endeavor to\r\n      consider for an instant the reflection of your person in yonder\r\n      mirror as the living mynheer hermann himself this being done\r\n      there will be no difficulty whatever i shall discharge this\r\n      decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror and thus fulfil\r\n      all the spirit if not the exact letter of resentment for your\r\n      insult while the necessity of physical violence to your real\r\n      person will be obviated\r\n\r\n      with these words he hurled the decanter full of wine against\r\n      the mirror which hung directly opposite hermann striking the\r\n      reflection of his person with great precision and of course\r\n      shattering the glass into fragments the whole company at once\r\n      started to their feet and with the exception of myself and\r\n      ritzner took their departure as hermann went out the baron\r\n      whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my\r\n      services to this i agreed not knowing precisely what to make of\r\n      so ridiculous a piece of business\r\n\r\n      the duellist accepted my aid with his stiff and ultra recherché\r\n      air and taking my arm led me to his apartment i could hardly\r\n      forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss with\r\n      the profoundest gravity what he termed the refinedly peculiar\r\n      character of the insult he had received after a tiresome\r\n      harangue in his ordinary style he took down from his book\r\n      shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello\r\n      and entertained me for a long time with their contents reading\r\n      aloud and commenting earnestly as he read i can just remember\r\n      the titles of some of the works there were the ordonnance of\r\n      philip le bel on single combat the theatre of honor by\r\n      favyn and a treatise on the permission of duels by andiguier\r\n      he displayed also with much pomposity brantomes memoirs of\r\n      duels published at cologne  in the types of elzevira\r\n      precious and unique vellumpaper volume with a fine margin and\r\n      bound by derome but he requested my attention particularly and\r\n      with an air of mysterious sagacity to a thick octavo written in\r\n      barbarous latin by one hedelin a frenchman and having the\r\n      quaint title duelli lex scripta et non aliterque from this\r\n      he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world concerning\r\n      injuriae per applicationem per constructionem et per se\r\n      about half of which he averred was strictly applicable to his\r\n      own refinedly peculiar case although not one syllable of the\r\n      whole matter could i understand for the life of me having\r\n      finished the chapter he closed the book and demanded what i\r\n      thought necessary to be done i replied that i had entire\r\n      confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling and would abide\r\n      by what he proposed with this answer he seemed flattered and\r\n      sat down to write a note to the baron it ran thus\r\n\r\n      sirmy friend m p will hand you this note i find it\r\n      incumbent upon me to request at your earliest convenience an\r\n      explanation of this evenings occurrences at your chambers in\r\n      the event of your declining this request mr p will be happy to\r\n      arrange with any friend whom you may appoint the steps\r\n      preliminary to a meeting\r\n\r\n      with sentiments of perfect respect\r\n\r\n      your most humble servant\r\n      johann herman\r\n\r\n      to the baron ritzner von jung\r\n      august th \r\n\r\n      not knowing what better to do i called upon ritzner with this\r\n      epistle he bowed as i presented it then with a grave\r\n      countenance motioned me to a seat having perused the cartel he\r\n      wrote the following reply which i carried to hermann\r\n\r\n      sirthrough our common friend mr p i have received your\r\n      note of this evening upon due reflection i frankly admit the\r\n      propriety of the explanation you suggest this being admitted i\r\n      still find great difficulty owing to the refinedly peculiar\r\n      nature of our disagreement and of the personal affront offered\r\n      on my part in so wording what i have to say by way of apology\r\n      as to meet all the minute exigencies and all the variable\r\n      shadows of the case i have great reliance however on that\r\n      extreme delicacy of discrimination in matters appertaining to\r\n      the rules of etiquette for which you have been so long and so\r\n      preeminently distinguished with perfect certainty therefore\r\n      of being comprehended i beg leave in lieu of offering any\r\n      sentiments of my own to refer you to the opinions of sieur\r\n      hedelin as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of\r\n      injuriae per applicationem per constructionem et per se in\r\n      his duelli lex scripta et non aliterque the nicety of your\r\n      discernment in all the matters here treated will be sufficient\r\n      i am assured to convince you that the mere circumstance of me\r\n      referring you to this admirable passage ought to satisfy your\r\n      request as a man of honor for explanation\r\n\r\n      with sentiments of profound respect\r\n\r\n      your most obedient servant\r\n      von jung\r\n\r\n      the herr johann hermann\r\n      august th \r\n\r\n      hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl\r\n      which however was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous\r\n      selfcomplacency as he came to the rigmarole about injuriae per\r\n      applicationem per constructionem et per se having finished\r\n      reading he begged me with the blandest of all possible smiles\r\n      to be seated while he made reference to the treatise in\r\n      question turning to the passage specified he read it with great\r\n      care to himself then closed the book and desired me in my\r\n      character of confidential acquaintance to express to the baron\r\n      von jung his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior and in\r\n      that of second to assure him that the explanation offered was of\r\n      the fullest the most honorable and the most unequivocally\r\n      satisfactory nature\r\n\r\n      somewhat amazed at all this i made my retreat to the baron he\r\n      seemed to receive hermanns amicable letter as a matter of\r\n      course and after a few words of general conversation went to an\r\n      inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise duelli lex\r\n      scripta et non aliterque he handed me the volume and asked\r\n      me to look over some portion of it i did so but to little\r\n      purpose not being able to gather the least particle of meaning\r\n      he then took the book himself and read me a chapter aloud to my\r\n      surprise what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd\r\n      account of a duel between two baboons he now explained the\r\n      mystery showing that the volume as it appeared prima facie\r\n      was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of du bartas\r\n      that is to say the language was ingeniously framed so as to\r\n      present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility and\r\n      even of profundity while in fact not a shadow of meaning\r\n      existed the key to the whole was found in leaving out every\r\n      second and third word alternately when there appeared a series\r\n      of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern\r\n      times\r\n\r\n      the baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the\r\n      treatise in hermanns way two or three weeks before the\r\n      adventure and that he was satisfied from the general tenor of\r\n      his conversation that he had studied it with the deepest\r\n      attention and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit\r\n      upon this hint he proceeded hermann would have died a thousand\r\n      deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand\r\n      anything and everything in the universe that had ever been\r\n      written about the duello\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiddling\r\n\r\nconsidered as one of the exact sciences\r\n\r\n\r\n      hey diddle diddle\r\n      the cat and the fiddle\r\n\r\n      since the world began there have been two jeremys the one wrote\r\n      a jeremiad about usury and was called jeremy bentham he has\r\n      been much admired by mr john neal and was a great man in a\r\n      small way the other gave name to the most important of the exact\r\n      sciences and was a great man in a great wayi may say indeed\r\n      in the very greatest of ways\r\n\r\n      diddlingor the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddleis\r\n      sufficiently well understood yet the fact the deed the thing\r\n      diddling is somewhat difficult to define we may get however\r\n      at a tolerably distinct conception of the matter in hand by\r\n      definingnot the thing diddling in itselfbut man as an animal\r\n      that diddles had plato but hit upon this he would have been\r\n      spared the affront of the picked chicken\r\n\r\n      very pertinently it was demanded of plato why a picked chicken\r\n      which was clearly a biped without feathers was not according\r\n      to his own definition a man but i am not to be bothered by any\r\n      similar query man is an animal that diddles and there is no\r\n      animal that diddles but man it will take an entire hencoop of\r\n      picked chickens to get over that\r\n\r\n      what constitutes the essence the nare the principle of diddling\r\n      is in fact peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats\r\n      and pantaloons a crow thieves a fox cheats a weasel outwits a\r\n      man diddles to diddle is his destiny man was made to mourn\r\n      says the poet but not sohe was made to diddle this is his\r\n      aimhis objecthis end and for this reason when a mans diddled\r\n      we say hes done\r\n\r\n      diddling rightly considered is a compound of which the\r\n      ingredients are minuteness interest perseverance ingenuity\r\n      audacity nonchalance originality impertinence and grin\r\n\r\n      minutenessyour diddler is minute his operations are upon a\r\n      small scale his business is retail for cash or approved paper\r\n      at sight should he ever be tempted into magnificent speculation\r\n      he then at once loses his distinctive features and becomes\r\n      what we term financier this latter word conveys the diddling\r\n      idea in every respect except that of magnitude a diddler may\r\n      thus be regarded as a banker in pettoa financial operation\r\n      as a diddle at brobdignag the one is to the other as homer to\r\n      flaccusas a mastodon to a mouseas the tail of a comet to that\r\n      of a pig\r\n\r\n      interestyour diddler is guided by selfinterest he scorns to\r\n      diddle for the mere sake of the diddle he has an object in\r\n      viewhis pocketand yours he regards always the main chance he\r\n      looks to number one you are number two and must look to\r\n      yourself\r\n\r\n      perseveranceyour diddler perseveres he is not readily\r\n      discouraged should even the banks break he cares nothing about\r\n      it he steadily pursues his end and\r\n\r\n      ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto\r\n\r\n      so he never lets go of his game\r\n\r\n      ingenuityyour diddler is ingenious he has constructiveness\r\n      large he understands plot he invents and circumvents were he\r\n      not alexander he would be diogenes were he not a diddler he\r\n      would be a maker of patent rattraps or an angler for trout\r\n\r\n      audacityyour diddler is audacioushe is a bold man he\r\n      carries the war into africa he conquers all by assault he would\r\n      not fear the daggers of frey herren with a little more prudence\r\n      dick turpin would have made a good diddler with a trifle less\r\n      blarney daniel oconnell with a pound or two more brains\r\n      charles the twelfth\r\n\r\n      nonchalanceyour diddler is nonchalant he is not at all\r\n      nervous he never had any nerves he is never seduced into a\r\n      flurry he is never put outunless put out of doors he is\r\n      coolcool as a cucumber he is calmcalm as a smile from lady\r\n      bury he is easyeasy as an old glove or the damsels of ancient\r\n      baiæ\r\n\r\n      originalityyour diddler is originalconscientiously so his\r\n      thoughts are his own he would scorn to employ those of another\r\n      a stale trick is his aversion he would return a purse i am\r\n      sure upon discovering that he had obtained it by an unoriginal\r\n      diddle\r\n\r\n      impertinenceyour diddler is impertinent he swaggers he sets\r\n      his arms akimbo he thrusts his hands in his trowsers pockets\r\n      he sneers in your face he treads on your corns he eats your\r\n      dinner he drinks your wine he borrows your money he pulls your\r\n      nose he kicks your poodle and he kisses your wife\r\n\r\n      grinyour true diddler winds up all with a grin but this\r\n      nobody sees but himself he grins when his daily work is\r\n      donewhen his allotted labors are accomplishedat night in his\r\n      own closet and altogether for his own private entertainment he\r\n      goes home he locks his door he divests himself of his clothes\r\n      he puts out his candle he gets into bed he places his head upon\r\n      the pillow all this done and your diddler grins this is no\r\n      hypothesis it is a matter of course i reason à priori and a\r\n      diddle would be no diddle without a grin\r\n\r\n      the origin of the diddle is referrable to the infancy of the\r\n      human race perhaps the first diddler was adam at all events we\r\n      can trace the science back to a very remote period of antiquity\r\n      the moderns however have brought it to a perfection never\r\n      dreamed of by our thickheaded progenitors without pausing to\r\n      speak of the old saws therefore i shall content myself with a\r\n      compendious account of some of the more modern instances\r\n\r\n      a very good diddle is this a housekeeper in want of a sofa for\r\n      instance is seen to go in and out of several cabinet warehouses\r\n      at length she arrives at one offering an excellent variety she\r\n      is accosted and invited to enter by a polite and voluble\r\n      individual at the door she finds a sofa well adapted to her\r\n      views and upon inquiring the price is surprised and delighted\r\n      to hear a sum named at least twenty per cent lower than her\r\n      expectations she hastens to make the purchase gets a bill and\r\n      receipt leaves her address with a request that the article be\r\n      sent home as speedily as possible and retires amid a profusion\r\n      of bows from the shopkeeper the night arrives and no sofa a\r\n      servant is sent to make inquiry about the delay the whole\r\n      transaction is denied no sofa has been soldno money\r\n      receivedexcept by the diddler who played shopkeeper for the\r\n      nonce\r\n\r\n      our cabinet warehouses are left entirely unattended and thus\r\n      afford every facility for a trick of this kind visitors enter\r\n      look at furniture and depart unheeded and unseen should any one\r\n      wish to purchase or to inquire the price of an article a bell\r\n      is at hand and this is considered amply sufficient\r\n\r\n      again quite a respectable diddle is this a welldressed\r\n      individual enters a shop makes a purchase to the value of a\r\n      dollar finds much to his vexation that he has left his\r\n      pocketbook in another coat pocket and so says to the\r\n      shopkeeper\r\n\r\n      my dear sir never mind just oblige me will you by sending\r\n      the bundle home but stay i really believe that i have nothing\r\n      less than a five dollar bill even there however you can send\r\n      four dollars in change with the bundle you know\r\n\r\n      very good sir replies the shopkeeper who entertains at\r\n      once a lofty opinion of the highmindedness of his customer i\r\n      know fellows he says to himself who would just have put the\r\n      goods under their arm and walked off with a promise to call and\r\n      pay the dollar as they came by in the afternoon\r\n\r\n      a boy is sent with the parcel and change on the route quite\r\n      accidentally he is met by the purchaser who exclaims\r\n\r\n      ah this is my bundle i seei thought you had been home with\r\n      it long ago well go on my wife mrs trotter will give you\r\n      the five dollarsi left instructions with her to that effect the\r\n      change you might as well give to mei shall want some silver for\r\n      the post office very good one two is this a good\r\n      quarterthree fourquite right say to mrs trotter that you\r\n      met me and be sure now and do not loiter on the way\r\n\r\n      the boy doesnt loiter at allbut he is a very long time in\r\n      getting back from his errandfor no lady of the precise name of\r\n      mrs trotter is to be discovered he consoles himself however\r\n      that he has not been such a fool as to leave the goods without\r\n      the money and reentering his shop with a selfsatisfied air\r\n      feels sensibly hurt and indignant when his master asks him what\r\n      has become of the change\r\n\r\n      a very simple diddle indeed is this the captain of a ship\r\n      which is about to sail is presented by an official looking\r\n      person with an unusually moderate bill of city charges glad to\r\n      get off so easily and confused by a hundred duties pressing upon\r\n      him all at once he discharges the claim forthwith in about\r\n      fifteen minutes another and less reasonable bill is handed him\r\n      by one who soon makes it evident that the first collector was a\r\n      diddler and the original collection a diddle\r\n\r\n      and here too is a somewhat similar thing a steamboat is\r\n      casting loose from the wharf a traveller portmanteau in hand\r\n      is discovered running toward the wharf at full speed suddenly\r\n      he makes a dead halt stoops and picks up something from the\r\n      ground in a very agitated manner it is a pocketbook andhas\r\n      any gentleman lost a pocketbook he cries no one can say that\r\n      he has exactly lost a pocketbook but a great excitement ensues\r\n      when the treasure trove is found to be of value the boat\r\n      however must not be detained\r\n\r\n      time and tide wait for no man says the captain\r\n\r\n      for gods sake stay only a few minutes says the finder of the\r\n      bookthe true claimant will presently appear\r\n\r\n      cant wait replies the man in authority cast off there dye\r\n      hear\r\n\r\n      what am i to do asks the finder in great tribulation i am\r\n      about to leave the country for some years and i cannot\r\n      conscientiously retain this large amount in my possession i beg\r\n      your pardon sir here he addresses a gentleman on shore but\r\n      you have the air of an honest man will you confer upon me the\r\n      favor of taking charge of this pocketbooki know i can trust\r\n      youand of advertising it the notes you see amount to a very\r\n      considerable sum the owner will no doubt insist upon rewarding\r\n      you for your trouble\r\n\r\n      meno youit was you who found the book\r\n\r\n      well if you must have it soi will take a small rewardjust\r\n      to satisfy your scruples let me seewhy these notes are all\r\n      hundredsbless my soul a hundred is too much to takefifty would\r\n      be quite enough i am sure\r\n\r\n      cast off there says the captain\r\n\r\n      but then i have no change for a hundred and upon the whole\r\n      you had better\r\n\r\n      cast off there says the captain\r\n\r\n      never mind cries the gentleman on shore who has been\r\n      examining his own pocketbook for the last minute or sonever\r\n      mind i can fix ithere is a fifty on the bank of north\r\n      americathrow the book\r\n\r\n      and the overconscientious finder takes the fifty with marked\r\n      reluctance and throws the gentleman the book as desired while\r\n      the steamboat fumes and fizzes on her way in about half an hour\r\n      after her departure the large amount is seen to be a\r\n      counterfeit presentment and the whole thing a capital diddle\r\n\r\n      a bold diddle is this a campmeeting or something similar is\r\n      to be held at a certain spot which is accessible only by means of\r\n      a free bridge a diddler stations himself upon this bridge\r\n      respectfully informs all passers by of the new county law which\r\n      establishes a toll of one cent for foot passengers two for\r\n      horses and donkeys and so forth and so forth some grumble but\r\n      all submit and the diddler goes home a wealthier man by some\r\n      fifty or sixty dollars well earned this taking a toll from a\r\n      great crowd of people is an excessively troublesome thing\r\n\r\n      a neat diddle is this a friend holds one of the diddlers\r\n      promises to pay filled up and signed in due form upon the\r\n      ordinary blanks printed in red ink the diddler purchases one or\r\n      two dozen of these blanks and every day dips one of them in his\r\n      soup makes his dog jump for it and finally gives it to him as a\r\n      bonne bouche the note arriving at maturity the diddler with\r\n      the diddlers dog calls upon the friend and the promise to pay\r\n      is made the topic of discussion the friend produces it from his\r\n      escritoire and is in the act of reaching it to the diddler when\r\n      up jumps the diddlers dog and devours it forthwith the diddler\r\n      is not only surprised but vexed and incensed at the absurd\r\n      behavior of his dog and expresses his entire readiness to cancel\r\n      the obligation at any moment when the evidence of the obligation\r\n      shall be forthcoming\r\n\r\n      a very mean diddle is this a lady is insulted in the street by a\r\n      diddlers accomplice the diddler himself flies to her\r\n      assistance and giving his friend a comfortable thrashing\r\n      insists upon attending the lady to her own door he bows with\r\n      his hand upon his heart and most respectfully bids her adieu\r\n      she entreats him as her deliverer to walk in and be introduced\r\n      to her big brother and her papa with a sigh he declines to do\r\n      so is there no way then sir she murmurs in which i may be\r\n      permitted to testify my gratitude\r\n\r\n      why yes madam there is will you be kind enough to lend me a\r\n      couple of shillings\r\n\r\n      in the first excitement of the moment the lady decides upon\r\n      fainting outright upon second thought however she opens her\r\n      pursestrings and delivers the specie now this i say is a\r\n      diddle minutefor one entire moiety of the sum borrowed has to be\r\n      paid to the gentleman who had the trouble of performing the\r\n      insult and who had then to stand still and be thrashed for\r\n      performing it\r\n\r\n      rather a small but still a scientific diddle is this the diddler\r\n      approaches the bar of a tavern and demands a couple of twists of\r\n      tobacco these are handed to him when having slightly examined\r\n      them he says\r\n\r\n      i dont much like this tobacco here take it back and give me\r\n      a glass of brandy and water in its place the brandy and water\r\n      is furnished and imbibed and the diddler makes his way to the\r\n      door but the voice of the tavernkeeper arrests him\r\n\r\n      i believe sir you have forgotten to pay for your brandy and\r\n      water\r\n\r\n      pay for my brandy and waterdidnt i give you the tobacco for\r\n      the brandy and water what more would you have\r\n\r\n      but sir if you please i dont remember that you paid me for\r\n      the tobacco\r\n\r\n      what do you mean by that you scoundreldidnt i give you back\r\n      your tobacco isnt that your tobacco lying there do you expect\r\n      me to pay for what i did not take\r\n\r\n      but sir says the publican now rather at a loss what to say\r\n      but sir\r\n\r\n      but me no buts sir interrupts the diddler apparently in very\r\n      high dudgeon and slamming the door after him as he makes his\r\n      escapebut me no buts sir and none of your tricks upon\r\n      travellers\r\n\r\n      here again is a very clever diddle of which the simplicity is\r\n      not its least recommendation a purse or pocketbook being\r\n      really lost the loser inserts in one of the daily papers of a\r\n      large city a fully descriptive advertisement\r\n\r\n      whereupon our diddler copies the facts of this advertisement\r\n      with a change of heading of general phraseology and address the\r\n      original for instance is long and verbose is headed a\r\n      pocketbook lost and requires the treasure when found to be\r\n      left at no  tom street the copy is brief and being headed\r\n      with lost only indicates no  dick or no  harry street as\r\n      the locality at which the owner may be seen moreover it is\r\n      inserted in at least five or six of the daily papers of the day\r\n      while in point of time it makes its appearance only a few hours\r\n      after the original should it be read by the loser of the purse\r\n      he would hardly suspect it to have any reference to his own\r\n      misfortune but of course the chances are five or six to one\r\n      that the finder will repair to the address given by the diddler\r\n      rather than to that pointed out by the rightful proprietor the\r\n      former pays the reward pockets the treasure and decamps\r\n\r\n      quite an analogous diddle is this a lady of ton has dropped\r\n      some where in the street a diamond ring of very unusual value\r\n      for its recovery she offers some forty or fifty dollars\r\n      rewardgiving in her advertisement a very minute description of\r\n      the gem and of its settings and declaring that on its\r\n      restoration at no so and so in such and such avenue the reward\r\n      would be paid instanter without a single question being asked\r\n      during the ladys absence from home a day or two afterwards a\r\n      ring is heard at the door of no so and so in such and such\r\n      avenue a servant appears the lady of the house is asked for and\r\n      is declared to be out at which astounding information the\r\n      visitor expresses the most poignant regret his business is of\r\n      importance and concerns the lady herself in fact he had the\r\n      good fortune to find her diamond ring but perhaps it would be as\r\n      well that he should call again by no means says the servant\r\n      and by no means says the ladys sister and the ladys\r\n      sisterinlaw who are summoned forthwith the ring is\r\n      clamorously identified the reward is paid and the finder nearly\r\n      thrust out of doors the lady returns and expresses some little\r\n      dissatisfaction with her sister and sisterinlaw because they\r\n      happen to have paid forty or fifty dollars for a facsimile of\r\n      her diamond ringa facsimile made out of real pinchbeck and\r\n      unquestionable paste\r\n\r\n      but as there is really no end to diddling so there would be none\r\n      to this essay were i even to hint at half the variations or\r\n      inflections of which this science is susceptible i must bring\r\n      this paper perforce to a conclusion and this i cannot do\r\n      better than by a summary notice of a very decent but rather\r\n      elaborate diddle of which our own city was made the theatre not\r\n      very long ago and which was subsequently repeated with success\r\n      in other still more verdant localities of the union a\r\n      middleaged gentleman arrives in town from parts unknown he is\r\n      remarkably precise cautious staid and deliberate in his\r\n      demeanor his dress is scrupulously neat but plain\r\n      unostentatious he wears a white cravat an ample waistcoat made\r\n      with an eye to comfort alone thicksoled cosylooking shoes and\r\n      pantaloons without straps he has the whole air in fact of your\r\n      welltodo sobersided exact and respectable man of\r\n      business par excellenceone of the stern and outwardly hard\r\n      internally soft sort of people that we see in the crack high\r\n      comediesfellows whose words are so many bonds and who are noted\r\n      for giving away guineas in charity with the one hand while in\r\n      the way of mere bargain they exact the uttermost fraction of a\r\n      farthing with the other\r\n\r\n      he makes much ado before he can get suited with a boarding house\r\n      he dislikes children he has been accustomed to quiet his habits\r\n      are methodicaland then he would prefer getting into a private\r\n      and respectable small family piously inclined terms however\r\n      are no objectonly he must insist upon settling his bill on the\r\n      first of every month it is now the second and begs his\r\n      landlady when he finally obtains one to his mind not on any\r\n      account to forget his instructions upon this pointbut to send in\r\n      a bill and receipt precisely at ten oclock on the first day\r\n      of every month and under no circumstances to put it off to the\r\n      second\r\n\r\n      these arrangements made our man of business rents an office in a\r\n      reputable rather than a fashionable quarter of the town there is\r\n      nothing he more despises than pretense where there is much\r\n      show he says there is seldom any thing very solid behindan\r\n      observation which so profoundly impresses his landladys fancy\r\n      that she makes a pencil memorandum of it forthwith in her great\r\n      family bible on the broad margin of the proverbs of solomon\r\n\r\n      the next step is to advertise after some such fashion as this\r\n      in the principal business sixpennies of the citythe pennies are\r\n      eschewed as not respectableand as demanding payment for all\r\n      advertisements in advance our man of business holds it as a\r\n      point of his faith that work should never be paid for until done\r\n\r\n      wantedthe advertisers being about to commence extensive\r\n      business operations in this city will require the services of\r\n      three or four intelligent and competent clerks to whom a liberal\r\n      salary will be paid the very best recommendations not so much\r\n      for capacity as for integrity will be expected indeed as the\r\n      duties to be performed involve high responsibilities and large\r\n      amounts of money must necessarily pass through the hands of those\r\n      engaged it is deemed advisable to demand a deposit of fifty\r\n      dollars from each clerk employed no person need apply\r\n      therefore who is not prepared to leave this sum in the\r\n      possession of the advertisers and who cannot furnish the most\r\n      satisfactory testimonials of morality young gentlemen piously\r\n      inclined will be preferred application should be made between\r\n      the

has\r\n      brought to the office of messrs bogs hogs logs frogs and\r\n      company some fifteen or twenty young gentlemen piously inclined\r\n      but our man of business is in no hurry to conclude a contract\r\n      with anyno man of business is ever precipitateand it is not\r\n      until the most rigid catechism in respect to the piety of each\r\n      young gentlemans inclination

the morning of the first day of the\r\n      next month the landlady does not present her bill according to\r\n      promisea piece of neglect for which the comfortable head of the\r\n      house ending in ogs would no doubt have chided her severely\r\n      could he have been prevailed upon to remain in town a day or two\r\n      for that purpose\r\n\r\n      as it is the constables have had a sad time of it running\r\n      hither and thither and all they can do is to declare the man of\r\n      business most emphatically a hen knee highby which some\r\n      persons imagine them to imply that in fact he is n e iby\r\n      which again the very classical phrase non est inventus is\r\n      supposed to be understood in the meantime the young gentlemen\r\n      one and all are somewhat less piously inclined than before\r\n      while the landlady purchases a shillings worth of the indian\r\n      rubber and very carefully obliterates the pencil memorandum that\r\n      some fool has made in her great family bible on the broad margin\r\n      of the proverbs of solomon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe angel of the odd\r\n\r\nan extravaganza\r\n\r\n\r\n      it was a chilly november afternoon i had just consummated an\r\n      unusually hearty dinner of which the dyspeptic truffe formed\r\n      not the least important item and was sitting alone in the\r\n      diningroom with my feet upon the fender and at my elbow a\r\n      small table which i had rolled up to the fire and upon which\r\n      were some apologies for dessert with some miscellaneous bottles\r\n      of wine spirit and liqueur in the morning i had been reading\r\n      glovers leonidas wilkies epigoniad lamartines\r\n      pilgrimage barlows columbiad tuckermanns sicily and\r\n      griswolds curiosities i am willing to confess therefore\r\n      that i now felt a little stupid i made effort to arouse myself\r\n      by aid of frequent lafitte and all failing i betook myself to\r\n      a stray newspaper in despair having carefully perused the column\r\n      of houses to let and the column of dogs lost and then the\r\n      two columns of wives and apprentices runaway i attacked with\r\n      great resolution the editorial matter and reading it from\r\n      beginning to end without understanding a syllable conceived the\r\n      possibility of its being chinese and so reread it from the end\r\n      to the beginning but with no more satisfactory result i was\r\n      about throwing away in disgust\r\n\r\n     this folio of four pages happy work\r\n     which not even critics criticise\r\n\r\n      when i felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which\r\n      follows\r\n\r\n      the avenues to death are numerous and strange a london paper\r\n      mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause he was\r\n      playing at puff the dart which is played with a long needle\r\n      inserted in some worsted and blown at a target through a tin\r\n      tube he placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube and\r\n      drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force\r\n      drew the needle into his throat it entered the lungs and in a\r\n      few days killed him\r\n\r\n      upon seeing this i fell into a great rage without exactly\r\n      knowing why this thing i exclaimed is a contemptible\r\n      falsehooda poor hoaxthe lees of the invention of some pitiable\r\n      pennyalinerof some wretched concoctor of accidents in\r\n      cocaigne these fellows knowing the extravagant gullibility of\r\n      the age set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable\r\n      possibilitiesof odd accidents as they term them but to a\r\n      reflecting intellect like mine i added in parenthesis\r\n      putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose to\r\n      a contemplative understanding such as i myself possess it seems\r\n      evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these odd\r\n      accidents is by far the oddest accident of all for my own part\r\n      i intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the\r\n      singular about it\r\n\r\n      mein gott den vat a vool you bees for dat replied one of the\r\n      most remarkable voices i ever heard at first i took it for a\r\n      rumbling in my earssuch as a man sometimes experiences when\r\n      getting very drunkbut upon second thought i considered the\r\n      sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty\r\n      barrel beaten with a big stick and in fact this i should have\r\n      concluded it to be but for the articulation of the syllables and\r\n      words i am by no means naturally nervous and the very few\r\n      glasses of lafitte which i had sipped served to embolden me no\r\n      little so that i felt nothing of trepidation but merely\r\n      uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement and looked carefully\r\n      around the room for the intruder i could not however perceive\r\n      any one at all\r\n\r\n      humph resumed the voice as i continued my survey you mus pe\r\n      so dronk as de pig den for not zee me as i zit here at your\r\n      zide\r\n\r\n      hereupon i bethought me of looking immediately before my nose\r\n      and there sure enough confronting me at the table sat a\r\n      personage nondescript although not altogether indescribable his\r\n      body was a winepipe or a rumpuncheon or something of that\r\n      character and had a truly falstaffian air in its nether\r\n      extremity were inserted two kegs which seemed to answer all the\r\n      purposes of legs for arms there dangled from the upper portion\r\n      of the carcass two tolerably long bottles with the necks outward\r\n      for hands all the head that i saw the monster possessed of was\r\n      one of those hessian canteens which resemble a large snuffbox\r\n      with a hole in the middle of the lid this canteen with a funnel\r\n      on its top like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes was set\r\n      on edge upon the puncheon with the hole toward myself and\r\n      through this hole which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a\r\n      very precise old maid the creature was emitting certain rumbling\r\n      and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible\r\n      talk\r\n\r\n      i zay said he you mos pe dronk as de pig vor zit dare and\r\n      not zee me zit ere and i zay doo you mos pe pigger vool as de\r\n      goose vor to dispelief vat iz print in de print tiz de\r\n      troofdat it izeberry

here for to let you zee for yourzelf\r\n\r\n      you are a drunken vagabond said i and i shall ring the bell\r\n      and order my footman to kick you into the street\r\n\r\n      he he he said the fellow hu hu hu dat you cant do\r\n\r\n      cant do said i what do you meani cant do what\r\n\r\n      ring de pell he replied attempting a grin with his little\r\n      villanous mouth\r\n\r\n      upon this i made an effort to get up in order to put my threat\r\n      into execution but the ruffian just reached across the table\r\n      very deliberately and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the\r\n      neck of one of the long bottles knocked me back into the\r\n      armchair from which i had half arisen i was utterly astounded\r\n      and for a moment was quite at a loss what to do in the\r\n      meantime he continued his talk\r\n\r\n      you zee said he it iz te bess vor zit still and now you\r\n      shall know who i pe look at me zee i am te angel ov te odd\r\n\r\n      and odd enough too i ventured to reply but i was always\r\n      under the impression that an angel had wings\r\n\r\n      te wing he cried highly incensed vat i pe do mit te wing\r\n      mein gott do you take me vor a shicken\r\n\r\n      nooh no i replied much alarmed you are no\r\n      chickencertainly not\r\n\r\n      well den zit still and pehabe yourself or ill rap you again\r\n      mid

your business with me at present isis\r\n\r\n      my pizzness ejaculated the thing vy vat a low bred buppy you\r\n      mos pe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness\r\n\r\n      this language was rather more than i could bear even from an\r\n      angel so plucking up courage i seized a saltcellar which lay\r\n      within reach and hurled it at the head of the intruder either\r\n      he dodged however or my aim was inaccurate for all i\r\n      accomplished was the demolition of the crystal which protected\r\n      the dial of the clock upon the mantelpiece as for the angel he\r\n      evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard\r\n      consecutive raps upon the forehead as before these reduced me at\r\n      once to submission and i am almost ashamed to confess that\r\n      either through pain or vexation there came a few tears into my\r\n      eyes\r\n\r\n      mein gott said the angel of the odd apparently much softened\r\n      at my distress mein gott te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry\r\n      zorry you mos not trink it so strongyou mos put te water in te\r\n      wine here trink dis like a goot veller und dont gry\r\n      nowdont\r\n\r\n      hereupon the angel of the odd replenished my goblet which was\r\n      about a third full of port with a colorless fluid that he poured\r\n      from one of his hand bottles i observed that these bottles had\r\n      labels about their necks and that these labels were inscribed\r\n      kirschenwasser\r\n\r\n      the considerate kindness of the angel mollified me in no little\r\n      measure and aided by the water with which he diluted my port\r\n      more than once i at length regained sufficient temper to listen\r\n      to his very extraordinary discourse i cannot pretend to recount\r\n      all that he told me but i gleaned from what he said that he was\r\n      the genius who presided over the contretemps of mankind and\r\n      whose business it was to bring about the odd accidents which\r\n      are continually astonishing the skeptic once or twice upon my\r\n      venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his\r\n      pretensions he grew very angry indeed so that at length i\r\n      considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all and let him\r\n      have his own way he talked on therefore at great length while\r\n      i merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut and amused\r\n      myself with munching raisins and filliping the stems about the\r\n      room but by and by the angel suddenly construed this behavior\r\n      of mine into contempt he arose in a terrible passion slouched\r\n      his funnel down over his eyes swore a vast oath uttered a\r\n      threat of some character which i did not precisely comprehend\r\n      and finally made me a low bow and departed wishing me in the\r\n      language of the archbishop in gilblas beaucoup de bonheur et\r\n      un peu plus de bon sens\r\n\r\n      his departure afforded me relief the very few glasses of\r\n      lafitte that i had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy\r\n      and i felt inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty\r\n      minutes as is my custom after dinner at six i had an\r\n      appointment of consequence which it was quite indispensable that\r\n      i should keep the policy of insurance for my dwelling house had\r\n      expired the day before and some dispute having arisen it was\r\n      agreed that at six i should meet the board of directors of the\r\n      company and settle the terms of a renewal glancing upward at the\r\n      clock on the mantelpiece for i felt too drowsy to take out my\r\n      watch i had the pleasure to find that i had still twentyfive\r\n      minutes to spare it was half past five i could easily walk to\r\n      the insurance office in five minutes and my usual siestas had\r\n      never been known to exceed five and twenty i felt sufficiently\r\n      safe therefore and composed myself to my slumbers forthwith\r\n\r\n      having completed them to my satisfaction i again looked toward\r\n      the timepiece and was half inclined to believe in the\r\n      possibility of odd accidents when i found that instead of my\r\n      ordinary fifteen or twenty minutes i had been dozing only three\r\n      for it still wanted seven and twenty of the appointed hour i\r\n      betook myself again to my nap and at length a second time awoke\r\n      when to my utter amazement it still wanted twentyseven\r\n      minutes of six i jumped up to examine the clock and found that\r\n      it had ceased running my watch informed me that it was half past\r\n      seven and of course having slept two hours i was too late for\r\n      my appointment it will make no difference i said i can call\r\n      at the office in the morning and apologize in the meantime what\r\n      can be the matter with the clock upon examining it i discovered\r\n      that one of the raisin stems which i had been filliping about the\r\n      room during the discourse of the angel of the odd had flown\r\n      through the fractured crystal and lodging singularly enough in\r\n      the keyhole with an end projecting outward had thus arrested\r\n      the revolution of the minute hand\r\n\r\n      ah said i i see how it is this thing speaks for itself a\r\n      natural accident such as will happen now and then\r\n\r\n      i gave the matter no further consideration and at my usual hour\r\n      retired to bed here having placed a candle upon a reading stand\r\n      at the bed head and having made an attempt to peruse some pages\r\n      of the omnipresence of the deity i unfortunately fell asleep\r\n      in less than twenty seconds leaving the light burning as it was\r\n\r\n      my dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the angel of\r\n      the odd methought he stood at the foot of the couch drew aside\r\n      the curtains and in the hollow detestable tones of a rum\r\n      puncheon menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the\r\n      contempt with which i had treated him he concluded a long\r\n      harangue by taking off his funnelcap inserting the tube into my\r\n      gullet and thus deluging me with an ocean of kirschenwässer\r\n      which he poured in a continuous flood from one of the long\r\n      necked bottles that stood him instead of an arm my agony was at\r\n      length insufferable and i awoke just in time to perceive that a\r\n      rat had ran off with the lighted candle from the stand but not\r\n      in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the\r\n      hole very soon a strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils\r\n      the house i clearly perceived was on fire in a few minutes the\r\n      blaze broke forth with violence and in an incredibly brief\r\n      period the entire building was wrapped in flames all egress from\r\n      my chamber except through a window was cut off the crowd\r\n      however quickly procured and raised a long ladder by means of\r\n      this i was descending rapidly and in apparent safety when a\r\n      huge hog about whose rotund stomach and indeed about whose\r\n      whole air and physiognomy there was something which reminded me\r\n      of the angel of the oddwhen this hog i say which hitherto had\r\n      been quietly slumbering in the mud took it suddenly into his\r\n      head that his left shoulder needed scratching and could find no\r\n      more convenient rubbingpost than that afforded by the foot of\r\n      the ladder in an instant i was precipitated and had the\r\n      misfortune to fracture my arm\r\n\r\n      this accident with the loss of my insurance and with the more\r\n      serious loss of my hair the whole of which had been singed off\r\n      by the fire predisposed me to serious impressions so that\r\n      finally i made up my mind to take a wife there was a rich widow\r\n      disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband and to her\r\n      wounded spirit i offered the balm of my vows she yielded a\r\n      reluctant consent to my prayers i knelt at her feet in gratitude\r\n      and adoration she blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into\r\n      close contact with those supplied me temporarily by grandjean\r\n      i know not how the entanglement took place but so it was i\r\n      arose with a shining pate wigless she in disdain and wrath\r\n      half buried in alien hair thus ended my hopes of the widow by an\r\n      accident which could not have been anticipated to be sure but\r\n      which the natural sequence of events had brought about\r\n\r\n      without despairing however i undertook the siege of a less\r\n      implacable heart the fates were again propitious for a brief\r\n      period but again a trivial incident interfered meeting my\r\n      betrothed in an avenue thronged with the élite of the city i\r\n      was hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows\r\n      when a small particle of some foreign matter lodging in the\r\n      corner of my eye rendered me for the moment completely blind\r\n      before i could recover my sight the lady of my love had\r\n      disappearedirreparably affronted at what she chose to consider\r\n      my premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted while i\r\n      stood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident which might\r\n      have happened nevertheless to any one under the sun and while\r\n      i still continued incapable of sight i was accosted by the angel\r\n      of the odd who proffered me his aid with a civility which i had\r\n      no reason to expect he examined my disordered eye with much\r\n      gentleness and skill informed me that i had a drop in it and\r\n      whatever a drop was took it out and afforded me relief\r\n\r\n      i now considered it high time to die since fortune had so\r\n      determined to persecute me and accordingly made my way to the\r\n      nearest river here divesting myself of my clothes for there\r\n      is no reason why we cannot die as we were born i threw myself\r\n      headlong into the current the sole witness of my fate being a\r\n      solitary crow that had been seduced into the eating of\r\n      brandysaturated corn and so had staggered away from his\r\n      fellows no sooner had i entered the water than this bird took it\r\n      into its head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of\r\n      my apparel postponing therefore for the present my suicidal\r\n      design i just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of\r\n      my coat and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the\r\n      nimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would\r\n      admit but my evil destiny attended me still as i ran at full\r\n      speed with my nose up in the atmosphere and intent only upon\r\n      the purloiner of my property i suddenly perceived that my feet\r\n      rested no longer upon terrafirma the fact is i had thrown\r\n      myself over a precipice and should inevitably have been dashed\r\n      to pieces but for my good fortune in grasping the end of a long\r\n      guiderope which depended from a passing balloon\r\n\r\n      as soon as i sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the\r\n      terrific predicament in which i stood or rather hung i exerted\r\n      all the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the\r\n      æronaut overhead but for a long time i exerted myself in vain\r\n      either the fool could not or the villain would not perceive me\r\n      meantime the machine rapidly soared while my strength even more\r\n      rapidly failed i was soon upon the point of resigning myself to\r\n      my fate and dropping quietly into the sea when my spirits were\r\n      suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above which\r\n      seemed to be lazily humming an opera air looking up i perceived\r\n      the angel of the odd he was leaning with his arms folded over\r\n      the rim of the car and with a pipe in his mouth at which he\r\n      puffed leisurely seemed to be upon excellent terms with himself\r\n      and the universe i was too much exhausted to speak so i merely\r\n      regarded him with an imploring air\r\n\r\n      for several minutes although he looked me full in the face he\r\n      said nothing at length removing carefully his meerschaum from\r\n      the right to the left corner of his mouth he condescended to\r\n      speak\r\n\r\n      who pe you he asked und what der teuffel you pe do dare\r\n\r\n      to this piece of impudence cruelty and affectation i could\r\n      reply only by ejaculating the monosyllable help\r\n\r\n      elp echoed the ruffiannot i dare iz te pottleelp yourself\r\n      und pe tamd\r\n\r\n      with these words he let fall a heavy bottle of kirschenwasser\r\n      which dropping precisely upon the crown of my head caused me to\r\n      imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out impressed with\r\n      this idea i was about to relinquish my hold and give up the\r\n      ghost with a good grace when i was arrested by the cry of the\r\n      angel who bade me hold on\r\n\r\n      old on he said dont pe in te urrydont will you pe take\r\n      de odder pottle or ave you pe got zober yet and come to your\r\n      zenzes\r\n\r\n      i made haste hereupon to nod my head twiceonce in the\r\n      negative meaning thereby that i would prefer not taking the\r\n      other bottle at presentand once in the affirmative intending\r\n      thus to imply that i was sober and had positively come to my\r\n      senses by these means i somewhat softened the angel\r\n\r\n      und you pelief ten he inquired at te last you pelief ten\r\n      in te possibilty of te odd\r\n\r\n      i again nodded my head in assent\r\n\r\n      und you ave pelief in me te angel of te odd\r\n\r\n      i nodded again\r\n\r\n      und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool\r\n\r\n      i nodded once more\r\n\r\n      put your right hand into your left hand preeches pocket ten in\r\n      token ov your vull zubmizzion unto te angel ov te odd\r\n\r\n      this thing for very obvious reasons i found it quite impossible\r\n      to do in the first place my left arm had been broken in my fall\r\n      from the ladder and therefore had i let go my hold with the\r\n      right hand i must have let go altogether in the second place i\r\n      could have no breeches until i came across the crow i was\r\n      therefore obliged much to my regret to shake my head in the\r\n      negativeintending thus to give the angel to understand that i\r\n      found it inconvenient just at that moment to comply with his\r\n      very reasonable demand no sooner however had i ceased shaking\r\n      my head than\r\n\r\n      go to der teuffel ten roared the angel of the odd\r\n\r\n      in pronouncing these words he drew a sharp knife across the\r\n      guiderope by which i was suspended and as we then happened to\r\n      be precisely over my own house which during my peregrinations\r\n      had been handsomely rebuilt it so occurred that i tumbled\r\n      headlong down the ample chimney and alit upon the diningroom\r\n      hearth\r\n\r\n      upon coming to my senses for the fall had very thoroughly\r\n      stunned me i found it about four oclock in the morning i lay\r\n      outstretched where i had fallen from the balloon my head\r\n      grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished fire while my feet\r\n      reposed upon the wreck of a small table overthrown and amid the\r\n      fragments of a miscellaneous dessert intermingled with a\r\n      newspaper some broken glass and shattered bottles and an empty\r\n      jug of the schiedam kirschenwasser thus revenged himself the\r\n      angel of the odd\r\n\r\n      mabbott states that griswold obviously had a revised form for\r\n      use in the  volume of poes works mabbott does not\r\n      substantiate this claim but it is surely not unreasonable an\r\n      editor and even typographical errors may have produced nearly\r\n      all of the very minor changes made in this version indeed two\r\n      very necessary words were clearly dropped by accident an editor\r\n      might have corrected wickliffes epigoniad to wilkies\r\n      epigoniad but is unlikely to have added tuckermans\r\n      sicily to the list of books read by the narrator griswold was\r\n      not above forgery in poes letters when it suited his purpose\r\n      but would have too little to gain by such an effort in this\r\n      instance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmellonta tauta\r\n\r\nto the editors of the ladys book\r\n\r\n\r\n      i have the honor of sending you for your magazine an article\r\n      which i hope you will be able

which i found about a year ago\r\n      tightly corked up in a jug floating in the mare tenebraruma sea\r\n      well described by the nubian geographer but seldom visited\r\n      nowadays except for

\r\n\r\n      now my dear friendnow for your sins you are to suffer the\r\n      infliction of a long gossiping letter i tell you distinctly that\r\n      i am going to punish you for all your impertinences by being as\r\n      tedious as discursive as incoherent and as unsatisfactory as\r\n      possible besides here i am cooped up in a dirty balloon with\r\n      some one or two hundred of the canaille all bound on a pleasure\r\n      excursion what a funny idea some people have of pleasure and\r\n      i have no prospect of touching terra firma for a month at least\r\n      nobody to talk to nothing to do when one has nothing to do\r\n      then is the time to correspond with ones friends you perceive\r\n      then why it is that i write you this letterit is on account of\r\n      my ennui and your sins\r\n\r\n      get ready your spectacles and make up your mind to be annoyed i\r\n      mean to write at you every day during this odious voyage\r\n\r\n      heigho when will any invention visit the human pericranium are\r\n      we forever to be doomed to the thousand inconveniences of the\r\n      balloon will nobody contrive a more expeditious mode of\r\n      progress the jogtrot movement to my thinking is little less\r\n      than positive torture upon my word we have not made more than a\r\n      hundred miles the hour since leaving home the very birds beat\r\n      usat least some of them i assure you that i do not exaggerate\r\n      at all our motion no doubt seems slower than it actually\r\n      isthis on account of our having no objects about us by which to\r\n      estimate our velocity and on account of our going with the wind\r\n      to be sure whenever we meet a balloon we have a chance of\r\n      perceiving our rate and then i admit things do not appear so\r\n      very bad accustomed as i am to this mode of travelling i cannot\r\n      get over a kind of giddiness whenever a balloon passes us in a\r\n      current directly overhead it always seems to me like an immense\r\n      bird of prey about to pounce upon us and carry us off in its\r\n      claws one went over us this morning about sunrise and so nearly\r\n      overhead that its dragrope actually brushed the network\r\n      suspending our car and caused us very serious apprehension our\r\n      captain said that if the material of the bag had been the\r\n      trumpery varnished silk of five hundred or a thousand years\r\n      ago we should inevitably have been damaged this silk as he\r\n      explained it to me was a fabric composed of the entrails of a\r\n      species of earthworm the worm was carefully fed on mulberriesa\r\n      kind of fruit resembling a watermelonand when sufficiently\r\n      fat was crushed in a mill the paste thus arising was called\r\n      papyrus in its primary state and went through a variety of\r\n      processes until it finally became silk singular to relate it\r\n      was once much admired as an article of female dress balloons\r\n      were also very generally constructed from it a better kind of\r\n      material it appears was subsequently found in the down\r\n      surrounding the seedvessels of a plant vulgarly called\r\n      euphorbium and at that time botanically termed milkweed this\r\n      latter kind of silk was designated as silkbuckingham on account\r\n      of its superior durability and was usually prepared for use by\r\n      being varnished with a solution of gum caoutchouca substance\r\n      which in some respects must have resembled the gutta percha now\r\n      in common use this caoutchouc was occasionally called indian\r\n      rubber or rubber of twist and was no doubt one of the numerous\r\n      fungi never tell me again that i am not at heart an antiquarian\r\n\r\n      talking of dragropesour own it seems has this moment knocked\r\n      a man overboard from one of the small magnetic propellers that\r\n      swarm in ocean below usa boat of about six thousand tons and\r\n      from all accounts shamefully crowded these diminutive barques\r\n      should be prohibited from carrying more than a definite number of\r\n      passengers the man of course was not permitted to get on board\r\n      again and was soon out of sight he and his lifepreserver i\r\n      rejoice my dear friend that we live in an age so enlightened\r\n      that no such a thing as an individual is supposed to exist it is\r\n      the mass for which the true humanity cares bytheby talking of\r\n      humanity do you know that our immortal wiggins is not so\r\n      original in his views of the social condition and so forth as\r\n      his contemporaries are inclined to suppose pundit assures me\r\n      that the same ideas were put nearly in the same way about a\r\n      thousand years ago by an irish philosopher called furrier on\r\n      account of his keeping a retail shop for cat peltries and other\r\n      furs pundit knows you know there can be no mistake about it\r\n      how very wonderfully do we see verified every day the profound\r\n      observation of the hindoo aries tottle as quoted by\r\n      punditthus must we say that not once or twice or a few\r\n      times but with almost infinite repetitions the same opinions\r\n      come round in a circle among men\r\n\r\n      april spoke today the magnetic cutter in charge of the middle\r\n      section of floating telegraph wires i learn that when this\r\n      species of telegraph was first put into operation by horse it\r\n      was considered quite impossible to convey the wires over sea but\r\n      now we are at a loss to comprehend where the difficulty lay so\r\n      wags the world tempora mutanturexcuse me for quoting the\r\n      etruscan what would we do without the atalantic telegraph\r\n      pundit says atlantic was the ancient adjective we lay to a few\r\n      minutes to ask the cutter some questions and learned among\r\n      other glorious news that civil war is raging in africa while\r\n      the plague is doing its good work beautifully both in yurope and\r\n      ayesher is it not truly remarkable that before the magnificent\r\n      light shed upon philosophy by humanity the world was accustomed\r\n      to regard war and pestilence as calamities do you know that\r\n      prayers were actually offered up in the ancient temples to the\r\n      end that these evils  might not be visited upon mankind is it\r\n      not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of\r\n      interest our forefathers acted were they so blind as not to\r\n      perceive that the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only\r\n      so much positive advantage to the mass\r\n\r\n      april it is really a very fine amusement to ascend the\r\n      ropeladder leading to the summit of the balloonbag and thence\r\n      survey the surrounding world from the car below you know the\r\n      prospect is not so comprehensiveyou can see little vertically\r\n      but seated here where i write this in the luxuriouslycushioned\r\n      open piazza of the summit one can see everything that is going\r\n      on in all directions just now there is quite a crowd of balloons\r\n      in sight and they present a very animated appearance while the\r\n      air is resonant with the hum of so many millions of human voices\r\n      i have heard it asserted that when yellow or pundit will have\r\n      it violet who is supposed to have been the first aeronaut\r\n      maintained the practicability of traversing the atmosphere in all\r\n      directions by merely ascending or descending until a favorable\r\n      current was attained he was scarcely hearkened to at all by his\r\n      contemporaries who looked upon him as merely an ingenious sort\r\n      of madman because the philosophers  of the day declared the\r\n      thing impossible really now it does seem to me quite\r\n      unaccountable how any thing so obviously feasible could have\r\n      escaped the sagacity of the ancient savans but in all ages the\r\n      great obstacles to advancement in art have been opposed by the\r\n      socalled men of science to be sure our men of science are not\r\n      quite so bigoted as those of oldoh i have something so queer\r\n      to tell you on this topic do you know that it is not more than a\r\n      thousand years ago since the metaphysicians consented to relieve\r\n      the people of the singular fancy that there existed but two\r\n      possible roads for the attainment of truth believe it if you\r\n      can it appears that long long ago in the night of time there\r\n      lived a turkish philosopher or hindoo possibly called aries\r\n      tottle this person introduced or at all events propagated what\r\n      was termed the deductive or a priori mode of investigation he\r\n      started with what he maintained to be axioms or selfevident\r\n      truths and thence proceeded logically to results his\r\n      greatest disciples were one neuclid and one cant well aries\r\n      tottle flourished supreme until advent of one hog surnamed the\r\n      ettrick shepherd who preached an entirely different system\r\n      which he called the a posteriori or inductive his plan referred\r\n      altogether to sensation he proceeded by observing analyzing\r\n      and classifying factsinstantiae naturae as they were affectedly\r\n      calledinto general laws aries tottles mode in a word was\r\n      based on noumena hogs on phenomena well so great was the\r\n      admiration excited by this latter system that at its first\r\n      introduction aries tottle fell into disrepute but finally he\r\n      recovered ground and was permitted to divide the realm of truth\r\n      with his more modern rival the savans now maintained the\r\n      aristotelian and baconian roads were the sole possible avenues to\r\n      knowledge baconian you must know was an adjective invented\r\n      as equivalent to hogian and more euphonious and dignified\r\n\r\n      now my dear friend i do assure you most positively that i\r\n      represent this matter fairly on the soundest authority and you\r\n      can easily understand how a notion so absurd on its very face\r\n      must have operated to retard the progress of all true\r\n      knowledgewhich makes its advances almost invariably by intuitive\r\n      bounds the ancient idea confined investigations to crawling and\r\n      for hundreds of years so great was the infatuation about hog\r\n      especially that a virtual end was put to all thinking properly\r\n      so called no man dared utter a truth to which he felt himself\r\n      indebted to his soul alone it mattered not whether the truth was\r\n      even demonstrably a truth for the bulletheaded savans of the\r\n      time regarded only the road by which he had attained it they\r\n      would not even look at the end let us see the means they\r\n      cried the means if upon investigation of the means it was\r\n      found to come under neither the category aries that is to say\r\n      ram nor under the category hog why then the savans went no\r\n      farther but pronounced the theorist a fool and would have\r\n      nothing to do with him or his truth\r\n\r\n      now it cannot be maintained even that by the crawling system\r\n      the greatest amount of truth would be attained in any long series\r\n      of ages for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be\r\n      compensated for by any superior certainty in the ancient modes of\r\n      investigation the error of these jurmains these vrinch these\r\n      inglitch and these amriccans the latter by the way were our\r\n      own immediate progenitors was an error quite analogous with\r\n      that of the wiseacre who fancies that he must necessarily see an\r\n      object the better the more closely he holds it to his eyes these\r\n      people blinded themselves by details when they proceeded\r\n      hoggishly their facts were by no means always factsa matter\r\n      of little consequence had it not been for assuming that they were\r\n      facts and must be facts because they appeared to be such when\r\n      they proceeded on the path of the ram their course was scarcely\r\n      as straight as a rams horn for they never had an axiom which\r\n      was an axiom at all they must have been very blind not to see\r\n      this even in their own day for even in their own day many of\r\n      the long established axioms had been rejected for exampleex\r\n      nihilo nihil fit a body cannot act where it is not there\r\n      cannot exist antipodes darkness cannot come out of lightall\r\n      these and a dozen other similar propositions formerly admitted\r\n      without hesitation as axioms were even at the period of which i\r\n      speak seen to be untenable how absurd in these people then to\r\n      persist in putting faith in axioms as immutable bases of truth\r\n      but even out of the mouths of their soundest reasoners it is easy\r\n      to demonstrate the futility the impalpability of their axioms in\r\n      general who was the soundest of their logicians let me see i\r\n      will go and ask pundit and be back in a minute ah here we\r\n      have it here is a book written nearly a thousand years ago and\r\n      lately translated from the inglitchwhich by the way appears to\r\n      have been the rudiment of the amriccan pundit says it is\r\n      decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic logic the\r\n      author who was much thought of in his day was one miller or\r\n      mill and we find it recorded of him as a point of some\r\n      importance that he had a millhorse called bentham but let us\r\n      glance at the treatise\r\n\r\n      ahability or inability to conceive says mr mill very\r\n      properly is in no case to be received as a criterion of\r\n      axiomatic truth what modern in his senses would ever think of\r\n      disputing this truism the only wonder with us must be how it\r\n      happened that mr mill conceived it necessary even to hint at any\r\n      thing so obvious so far goodbut let us turn over another paper\r\n      what have we herecontradictories cannot both be truethat is\r\n      cannot coexist in nature here mr mill means for example\r\n      that a tree must be either a tree or not a treethat it cannot be\r\n      at the same time a tree and not a tree very well but i ask him\r\n      why his reply is thisand never pretends to be any thing else\r\n      than thisbecause it is impossible to conceive that\r\n      contradictories can both be true but this is no answer at all\r\n      by his own showing for has he not just admitted as a truism that\r\n      ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be received as\r\n      a criterion of axiomatic truth\r\n\r\n      now i do not complain of these ancients so much because their\r\n      logic is by their own showing utterly baseless worthless and\r\n      fantastic altogether as because of their pompous and imbecile\r\n      proscription of all other roads of truth of all other means for\r\n      its attainment than the two preposterous pathsthe one of\r\n      creeping and the one of crawlingto which they have dared to\r\n      confine the soul that loves nothing so well as to soar\r\n\r\n      by the by my dear friend do you not think it would have puzzled\r\n      these ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their\r\n      two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all\r\n      their truths was in effect attained i mean the truth of\r\n      gravitation newton owed it to kepler kepler admitted that his\r\n      three laws were guessed atthese three laws of all laws which led\r\n      the great inglitch mathematician to his principle the basis of\r\n      all physical principleto go behind which we must enter the\r\n      kingdom of metaphysics kepler guessedthat is to say imagined\r\n      he was essentially a theoristthat word now of so much\r\n      sanctity formerly an epithet of contempt would it not have\r\n      puzzled these old moles too to have explained by which of the\r\n      two roads a cryptographist unriddles a cryptograph of more than\r\n      usual secrecy or by which of the two roads champollion directed\r\n      mankind to those enduring and almost innumerable truths which\r\n      resulted from his deciphering the hieroglyphics\r\n\r\n      one word more on this topic and i will be done boring you is it\r\n      not passing strange that with their eternal prattling about\r\n      roads to truth these bigoted people missed what we now so\r\n      clearly perceive to be the great highwaythat of consistency\r\n      does it not seem singular how they should have failed to deduce\r\n      from the works of god the vital fact that a perfect consistency\r\n      must be an absolute truth how plain has been our progress since\r\n      the late announcement of this proposition investigation has been\r\n      taken out of the hands of the groundmoles and given as a task\r\n      to the true and only true thinkers the men of ardent\r\n      imagination these latter theorize can you not fancy the shout\r\n      of scorn with which my words would be received by our progenitors\r\n      were it possible for them to be now looking over my shoulder\r\n      these men i say theorize and their theories are simply\r\n      corrected reduced systematizedcleared little by little of\r\n      their dross of inconsistencyuntil finally a perfect\r\n      consistency stands apparent which even the most stolid admit\r\n      because it is a consistency to be an absolute and an\r\n      unquestionable truth\r\n\r\n      april the new gas is doing wonders in conjunction with the\r\n      new improvement with gutta percha how very safe commodious\r\n      manageable and in every respect convenient are our modern\r\n      balloons here is an immense one approaching us at the rate of at\r\n      least a hundred and fifty miles an hour it seems to be crowded\r\n      with peopleperhaps there are three or four hundred\r\n      passengersand yet it soars to an elevation of nearly a mile\r\n      looking down upon poor us with sovereign contempt still a\r\n      hundred or even two hundred miles an hour is slow travelling\r\n      after all do you remember our flight on the railroad across the\r\n      kanadaw continentfully three hundred miles the hourthat was\r\n      travelling nothing to be seen thoughnothing to be done but\r\n      flirt feast and dance in the magnificent saloons do you\r\n      remember what an odd sensation was experienced when by chance\r\n      we caught a glimpse of external objects while the cars were in\r\n      full flight every thing seemed uniquein one mass for my part\r\n      i cannot say but that i preferred the travelling by the slow\r\n      train of a hundred miles the hour here we were permitted to have\r\n      glass windowseven to have them openand something like a\r\n      distinct view of the country was attainable pundit says that\r\n      the route for the great kanadaw railroad must have been in some\r\n      measure marked out about nine hundred years ago in fact he goes\r\n      so far as to assert that actual traces of a road are still\r\n      discernibletraces referable to a period quite as remote as that\r\n      mentioned the track it appears was double only ours you know\r\n      has twelve paths and three or four new ones are in preparation\r\n      the ancient rails were very slight and placed so close together\r\n      as to be according to modern notions quite frivolous if not\r\n      dangerous in the extreme the present width of trackfifty\r\n      feetis considered indeed scarcely secure enough for my part\r\n      i make no doubt that a track of some sort must have existed in\r\n      very remote times as pundit asserts for nothing can be clearer\r\n      to my mind than that at some periodnot less than seven\r\n      centuries ago certainlythe northern and southern kanadaw\r\n      continents were united the kanawdians then would have been\r\n      driven by necessity to a great railroad across the continent\r\n\r\n      april i am almost devoured by ennui pundit is the only\r\n      conversible person on board and he poor soul can speak of\r\n      nothing but antiquities he has been occupied all the day in the\r\n      attempt to convince me that the ancient amriccans governed\r\n      themselvesdid ever anybody hear of such an absurditythat they\r\n      existed in a sort of everymanforhimself confederacy after the\r\n      fashion of the prairie dogs that we read of in fable he says\r\n      that they started with the queerest idea conceivable viz that\r\n      all men are born free and equalthis in the very teeth of the\r\n      laws of gradation so visibly impressed upon all things both in\r\n      the moral and physical universe every man voted as they\r\n      called itthat is to say meddled with public affairsuntil at\r\n      length it was discovered that what is everybodys business is\r\n      nobodys and that the republic so the absurd thing was\r\n      called was without a government at all it is related however\r\n      that the first circumstance which disturbed very particularly\r\n      the selfcomplacency of the philosophers who constructed this\r\n      republic was the startling discovery that universal suffrage\r\n      gave opportunity for fraudulent schemes by means of which any\r\n      desired number of votes might at any time be polled without the\r\n      possibility of prevention or even detection by any party which\r\n      should be merely villainous enough not to be ashamed of the\r\n      fraud a little reflection upon this discovery sufficed to render\r\n      evident the consequences which were that rascality must\r\n      predominatein a word that a republican government could never\r\n      be any thing but a rascally one while the philosophers however\r\n      were busied in blushing at their stupidity in not having foreseen\r\n      these inevitable evils and intent upon the invention of new\r\n      theories the matter was put to an abrupt issue by a fellow of\r\n      the name of mob who took every thing into his own hands and set\r\n      up a despotism in comparison with which those of the fabulous\r\n      zeros and hellofagabaluses were respectable and delectable this\r\n      mob a foreigner bytheby is said to have been the most\r\n      odious of all men that ever encumbered the earth he was a giant\r\n      in statureinsolent rapacious filthy had the gall of a bullock\r\n      with the heart of a hyena and the brains of a peacock he died\r\n      at length by dint of his own energies which exhausted him\r\n      nevertheless he had his uses as every thing has however vile\r\n      and taught mankind a lesson which to this day it is in no danger\r\n      of forgettingnever to run directly contrary to the natural\r\n      analogies as for republicanism no analogy could be found for it\r\n      upon the face of the earthunless we except the case of the\r\n      prairie dogs an exception which seems to demonstrate if\r\n      anything that democracy is a very admirable form of\r\n      governmentfor dogs\r\n\r\n      april last night had a fine view of alpha lyrae whose disk\r\n      through our captains spyglass subtends an angle of half a\r\n      degree looking very much as our sun does to the naked eye on a\r\n      misty day alpha lyrae although so very much larger than our\r\n      sun by the by resembles him closely as regards its spots its\r\n      atmosphere and in many other particulars it is only within the\r\n      last century pundit tells me that the binary relation existing\r\n      between these two orbs began even to be suspected the evident\r\n      motion of our system in the heavens was strange to say\r\n      referred to an orbit about a prodigious star in the centre of the\r\n      galaxy about this star or at all events about a centre of\r\n      gravity common to all the globes of the milky way and supposed to\r\n      be near alcyone in the pleiades every one of these globes was\r\n      declared to be revolving our own performing the circuit in a\r\n      period of  of years we with our present lights our\r\n      vast telescopic improvements and so forth of course find it\r\n      difficult to comprehend the ground of an idea such as this its\r\n      first propagator was one mudler he was led we must presume to\r\n      this wild hypothesis by mere analogy in the first instance but\r\n      this being the case he should have at least adhered to analogy\r\n      in its development a great central orb was in fact suggested\r\n      so far mudler was consistent this central orb however\r\n      dynamically should have been greater than all its surrounding\r\n      orbs taken together the question might then have been askedwhy\r\n      do we not see itwe especially who occupy the mid region of\r\n      the clusterthe very locality near which at least must be\r\n      situated this inconceivable central sun the astronomer perhaps\r\n      at this point took refuge in the suggestion of nonluminosity\r\n      and here analogy was suddenly let fall but even admitting the\r\n      central orb nonluminous how did he manage to explain its\r\n      failure to be rendered visible by the incalculable host of\r\n      glorious suns glaring in all directions about it no doubt what\r\n      he finally maintained was merely a centre of gravity common to\r\n      all the revolving orbsbut here again analogy must have been let\r\n      fall our system revolves it is true about a common centre of\r\n      gravity but it does this in connection with and in consequence\r\n      of a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the rest\r\n      of the system the mathematical circle is a curve composed of an\r\n      infinity of straight lines but this idea of the circlethis idea\r\n      of it which in regard to all earthly geometry we consider as\r\n      merely the mathematical in contradistinction from the practical\r\n      ideais in sober fact the practical conception which alone we\r\n      have any right to entertain in respect to those titanic circles\r\n      with which we have to deal at least in fancy when we suppose\r\n      our system with its fellows revolving about a point in the\r\n      centre of the galaxy let the most vigorous of human imaginations\r\n      but attempt to take a single step toward the comprehension of a\r\n      circuit so unutterable it would scarcely be paradoxical to say\r\n      that a flash of lightning itself travelling forever upon the\r\n      circumference of this inconceivable circle would still forever\r\n      be travelling in a straight line that the path of our sun along\r\n      such a circumferencethat the direction of our system in such an\r\n      orbitwould to any human perception deviate in the slightest\r\n      degree from a straight line even in a million of years is a\r\n      proposition not to be entertained and yet these ancient\r\n      astronomers were absolutely cajoled it appears into believing\r\n      that a decisive curvature had become apparent during the brief\r\n      period of their astronomical historyduring the mere pointduring\r\n      the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years how\r\n      incomprehensible that considerations such as this did not at\r\n      once indicate to them the true state of affairsthat of the\r\n      binary revolution of our sun and alpha lyrae around a common\r\n      centre of gravity\r\n\r\n      april continued last night our astronomical amusements had a\r\n      fine view of the five neptunian asteroids and watched with much\r\n      interest the putting up of a huge impost on a couple of lintels\r\n      in the new temple at daphnis in the moon it was amusing to think\r\n      that creatures so diminutive as the lunarians and bearing so\r\n      little resemblance to humanity yet evinced a mechanical\r\n      ingenuity so much superior to our own one finds it difficult\r\n      too to conceive the vast masses which these people handle so\r\n      easily to be as light as our own reason tells us they actually\r\n      are\r\n\r\n      april eureka pundit is in his glory a balloon from kanadaw\r\n      spoke us today and threw on board several late papers they\r\n      contain some exceedingly curious information relative to\r\n      kanawdian or rather amriccan antiquities you know i presume\r\n      that laborers have for some months been employed in preparing the\r\n      ground for a new fountain at paradise the emperors principal\r\n      pleasure garden paradise it appears has been literally\r\n      speaking an island time out of mindthat is to say its northern\r\n      boundary was always as far back as any record extends a\r\n      rivulet or rather a very narrow arm of the sea this arm was\r\n      gradually widened until it attained its present breadtha mile\r\n      the whole length of the island is nine miles the breadth varies\r\n      materially the entire area so pundit says was about eight\r\n      hundred years ago densely packed with houses some of them\r\n      twenty stories high land for some most unaccountable reason\r\n      being considered as especially precious just in this vicinity\r\n      the disastrous earthquake however of the year  so totally\r\n      uprooted and overwhelmed the town for it was almost too large to\r\n      be called a village that the most indefatigable of our\r\n      antiquarians have never yet been able to obtain from the site any\r\n      sufficient data in the shape of coins medals or inscriptions\r\n      wherewith to build up even the ghost of a theory concerning the\r\n      manners customs c c c of the aboriginal inhabitants\r\n      nearly all that we have hitherto known of them is that they were\r\n      a portion of the knickerbocker tribe of savages infesting the\r\n      continent at its first discovery by recorder riker a knight of\r\n      the golden fleece they were by no means uncivilized however\r\n      but cultivated various arts and even sciences after a fashion of\r\n      their own it is related of them that they were acute in many\r\n      respects but were oddly afflicted with monomania for building\r\n      what in the ancient amriccan was denominated churchesa kind\r\n      of pagoda instituted for the worship of two idols that went by\r\n      the names of wealth and fashion in the end it is said the\r\n      island became nine tenths of it church the women too it\r\n      appears were oddly deformed by a natural protuberance of the\r\n      region just below the small of the backalthough most\r\n      unaccountably this deformity was looked upon altogether in the\r\n      light of a beauty one or two pictures of these singular women\r\n      have in fact been miraculously preserved they look very odd\r\n      verylike something between a turkeycock and a dromedary\r\n\r\n      well these few details are nearly all that have descended to us\r\n      respecting the ancient knickerbockers it seems however that\r\n      while digging in the centre of the emperors garden which you\r\n      know covers the whole island some of the workmen unearthed a\r\n      cubical and evidently chiseled block of granite weighing several\r\n      hundred pounds it was in good preservation having received\r\n      apparently little injury from the convulsion which entombed it\r\n      on one of its surfaces was a marble slab with only think of it\r\n      an inscriptiona legible inscription pundit is in ecstacies\r\n      upon detaching the slab a cavity appeared containing a leaden\r\n      box filled with various coins a long scroll of names several\r\n      documents which appear to resemble newspapers with other matters\r\n      of intense interest to the antiquarian there can be no doubt\r\n      that all these are genuine amriccan relics belonging to the tribe\r\n      called knickerbocker the papers thrown on board our balloon are\r\n      filled with facsimiles of the coins mss typography c c\r\n      i copy for your

   this as i give it is a verbatim translation done by pundit\r\n      himself so there can be no mistake about it from the few words\r\n      thus preserved we glean several important items of knowledge\r\n      not the least interesting of which is the fact that a thousand\r\n      years ago actual monuments had fallen into disuseas was all very\r\n      properthe people contenting themselves as we do now with a\r\n      mere indication of the design to erect a monument at some future\r\n      time a cornerstone being cautiously laid by itself solitary\r\n      and alone excuse me for quoting the great american poet\r\n      benton as a guarantee of the magnanimous intention we\r\n      ascertain too very distinctly from this admirable inscription\r\n      the how as well as the where and the what of the great surrender\r\n      in question as to the where it was yorktown wherever that\r\n      was and as to the what it was general cornwallis no doubt\r\n      some wealthy dealer in corn he was surrendered the inscription\r\n      commemorates the surrender ofwhatwhy of lord cornwallis\r\n      the only question is what could the savages wish him surrendered\r\n      for but when we remember that these savages were undoubtedly\r\n      cannibals we are led to the conclusion that they intended him\r\n      for sausage as to the how of the surrender no language can be\r\n      more explicit lord cornwallis was surrendered for sausage\r\n      under the auspices of the washington monument associationno\r\n      doubt a charitable institution for the depositing of\r\n      cornerstonesbut heaven bless me what is the matter ah i\r\n      seethe balloon has collapsed and we shall have a tumble into\r\n      the sea i have therefore only time enough to add that from a\r\n      hasty inspection of the facsimiles of newspapers c c i\r\n      find that the great men in those days among the amriccans were\r\n      one john a smith and one zacchary a

box\r\n\r\n\r\n      some years ago i engaged passage from charleston s c to the\r\n      city of new york in the fine packetship independence captain\r\n      hardy we were to sail on the fifteenth of the month june\r\n      weather permitting and on the fourteenth i went on board to\r\n      arrange some matters in my stateroom\r\n\r\n      i found that we were to have a great many passengers including a\r\n      more than usual number of ladies on the list were several of my\r\n      acquaintances and among other names i was rejoiced to see that\r\n      of mr cornelius wyatt a young artist for whom i entertained\r\n      feelings of warm friendship he had been with me a fellowstudent\r\n      at c university where we were very much together he had the\r\n      ordinary temperament of genius and was a compound of\r\n      misanthropy sensibility and enthusiasm to these qualities he\r\n      united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human\r\n      bosom\r\n\r\n      i observed that his name was carded upon three staterooms and\r\n      upon again referring to the list of passengers i found that he\r\n      had engaged passage for himself wife and two sistershis own\r\n      the staterooms were sufficiently roomy and each had two berths\r\n      one above the other these berths to be sure were so\r\n      exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one\r\n      person still i could not comprehend why there were three\r\n      staterooms for these four persons i was just at that epoch in\r\n      one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally\r\n      inquisitive about trifles and i confess with shame that i\r\n      busied myself in a variety of illbred and preposterous\r\n      conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary stateroom it\r\n      was no business of mine to be sure but with none the less\r\n      pertinacity did i occupy myself in attempts to resolve the\r\n      enigma at last i reached a conclusion which wrought in me great\r\n      wonder why i had not arrived at it before it is a servant of\r\n      course i said what a fool i am not sooner to have thought of\r\n      so obvious a solution and then i again repaired to the listbut\r\n      here i saw distinctly that no servant was to come with the party\r\n      although in fact it had been the original design to bring\r\n      onefor the words and servant had been first written and then\r\n      overscored oh extra baggage to be sure i now said to\r\n      myselfsomething he wishes not to be put in the holdsomething\r\n      to be kept under his own eyeah i have ita painting or soand\r\n      this is what he has been bargaining about with nicolino the\r\n      italian jew this idea satisfied me and i dismissed my\r\n      curiosity for the nonce\r\n\r\n      wyatts two sisters i knew very well and most amiable and clever\r\n      girls they were his wife he had newly married and i had never\r\n      yet seen her he had often talked about her in my presence\r\n      however and in his usual style of enthusiasm he described her\r\n      as of surpassing beauty wit and accomplishment i was\r\n      therefore quite anxious to make her acquaintance\r\n\r\n      on the day in which i visited the ship the fourteenth wyatt\r\n      and party were also to visit itso the captain informed meand i\r\n      waited on board an hour longer than i had designed in hope of\r\n      being presented to the bride but then an apology came mrs w\r\n      was a little indisposed and would decline coming on board until\r\n      tomorrow at the hour of sailing\r\n\r\n      the morrow having arrived i was going from my hotel to the\r\n      wharf when captain hardy met me and said that owing to\r\n      circumstances a stupid but convenient phrase he rather\r\n      thought the independence would not sail for a day or two and\r\n      that when all was ready he would send up and let me know this\r\n      i thought strange for there was a stiff southerly breeze but as\r\n      the circumstances were not forthcoming although i pumped for\r\n      them with much perseverance i had nothing to do but to return\r\n      home and digest my impatience at leisure\r\n\r\n      i did not receive the expected message from the captain for\r\n      nearly a week it came at length however and i immediately went\r\n      on board the ship was crowded with passengers and every thing\r\n      was in the bustle attendant upon making sail wyatts party\r\n      arrived in about ten minutes after myself there were the two\r\n      sisters the bride and the artistthe latter in one of his\r\n      customary fits of moody misanthropy i was too well used to\r\n      these however to pay them any special attention he did not\r\n      even introduce me to his wifethis courtesy devolving per force\r\n      upon his sister mariana very sweet and intelligent girl who in\r\n      a few hurried words made us acquainted\r\n\r\n      mrs wyatt had been closely veiled and when she raised her veil\r\n      in acknowledging my bow i confess that i was very profoundly\r\n      astonished i should have been much more so however had not\r\n      long experience advised me not to trust with too implicit a\r\n      reliance the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend the artist\r\n      when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman when\r\n      beauty was the theme i well knew with what facility he soared\r\n      into the regions of the purely ideal\r\n\r\n      the truth is i could not help regarding mrs wyatt as a\r\n      decidedly plainlooking woman if not positively ugly she was\r\n      not i think very far from it she was dressed however in\r\n      exquisite tasteand then i had no doubt that she had captivated\r\n      my friends heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect\r\n      and soul she said very few words and passed at once into her\r\n      stateroom with mr w\r\n\r\n      my old inquisitiveness now returned there was no servantthat\r\n      was a settled point i looked therefore for the extra baggage\r\n      after some delay a cart arrived at the wharf with an oblong\r\n      pine box which was every thing that seemed to be expected\r\n      immediately upon its arrival we made sail and in a short time\r\n      were safely over the bar and standing out to sea\r\n\r\n      the box in question was as i say oblong it was about six feet\r\n      in length by two and a half in breadth i observed it\r\n      attentively and like to be precise now this shape was peculiar\r\n      and no sooner had i seen it than i took credit to myself for the\r\n      accuracy of my guessing i had reached the conclusion it will be\r\n      remembered that the extra baggage of my friend the artist\r\n      would prove to be pictures or at least a picture for i knew he\r\n      had been for several weeks in conference with nicolinoand now\r\n      here was a box which from its shape could possibly contain\r\n      nothing in the world but a copy of leonardos last supper and\r\n      a copy of this very last supper done by rubini the younger at\r\n      florence i had known for some time to be in the possession of\r\n      nicolino this point therefore i considered as sufficiently\r\n      settled i chuckled excessively when i thought of my acumen it\r\n      was the first time i had ever known wyatt to keep from me any of\r\n      his artistical secrets but here he evidently intended to steal a\r\n      march upon me and smuggle a fine picture to new york under my\r\n      very nose expecting me to know nothing of the matter i resolved\r\n      to quiz him well now and hereafter\r\n\r\n      one thing however annoyed me not a little the box did not go\r\n      into the extra stateroom it was deposited in wyatts own and\r\n      there too it remained occupying very nearly the whole of the\r\n      floorno doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his\r\n      wifethis the more especially as the tar or paint with which it\r\n      was lettered in sprawling capitals emitted a strong\r\n      disagreeable and to my fancy a peculiarly disgusting odor on\r\n      the lid were painted the wordsmrs adelaide curtis albany new\r\n      york charge of cornelius wyatt esq this side up to be handled\r\n      with care\r\n\r\n      now i was aware that mrs adelaide curtis of albany was the\r\n      artists wifes motherbut then i looked upon the whole address\r\n      as a mystification intended especially for myself i made up my\r\n      mind of course that the box and contents would never get\r\n      farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend in\r\n      chambers street new york\r\n\r\n      for the first three or four days we had fine weather although\r\n      the wind was dead ahead having chopped round to the northward\r\n      immediately upon our losing sight of the coast the passengers\r\n      were consequently in high spirits and disposed to be social i\r\n      must except however wyatt and his sisters who behaved stiffly\r\n      and i could not help thinking uncourteously to the rest of the\r\n      party wyatts conduct i did not so much regard he was gloomy\r\n      even beyond his usual habitin fact he was morosebut in him i\r\n      was prepared for eccentricity for the sisters however i could\r\n      make no excuse they secluded themselves in their staterooms\r\n      during the greater part of the passage and absolutely refused\r\n      although i repeatedly urged them to hold communication with any\r\n      person on board\r\n\r\n      mrs wyatt herself was far more agreeable that is to say she\r\n      was chatty and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea\r\n      she became excessively intimate with most of the ladies and to\r\n      my profound astonishment evinced no equivocal disposition to\r\n      coquet with the men she amused us all very much i say\r\n      amusedand scarcely know how to explain myself the truth is i\r\n      soon found that mrs w was far oftener laughed at than with the\r\n      gentlemen said little about her but the ladies in a little\r\n      while pronounced her a goodhearted thing rather indifferent\r\n      looking totally uneducated and decidedly vulgar the great\r\n      wonder was how wyatt had been entrapped into such a match\r\n      wealth was the general solutionbut this i knew to be no solution\r\n      at all for wyatt had told me that she neither brought him a\r\n      dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever he had\r\n      married he said for love and for love only and his bride\r\n      was far more than worthy of his love when i thought of these\r\n      expressions on the part of my friend i confess that i felt\r\n      indescribably puzzled could it be possible that he was taking\r\n      leave of his senses what else could i think he so refined so\r\n      intellectual so fastidious with so exquisite a perception of\r\n      the faulty and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful to be\r\n      sure the lady seemed especially fond of himparticularly so in\r\n      his absencewhen she made herself ridiculous by frequent\r\n      quotations of what had been said by her beloved husband mr\r\n      wyatt the word husband seemed foreverto use one of her own\r\n      delicate expressionsforever on the tip of her tongue in the\r\n      meantime it was observed by all on board that he avoided her in\r\n      the most pointed manner and for the most part shut himself up\r\n      alone in his stateroom where in fact he might have been said\r\n      to live altogether leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse\r\n      herself as she thought best in the public society of the main\r\n      cabin\r\n\r\n      my conclusion from what i saw and heard was that the artist\r\n      by some unaccountable freak of fate or perhaps in some fit of\r\n      enthusiastic and fanciful passion had been induced to unite\r\n      himself with a person altogether beneath him and that the\r\n      natural result entire and speedy disgust had ensued i pitied\r\n      him from the bottom of my heartbut could not for that reason\r\n      quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the last\r\n      supper for this i resolved to have my revenge\r\n\r\n      one day he came upon deck and taking his arm as had been my\r\n      wont i sauntered with him backward and forward his gloom\r\n      however which i considered quite natural under the\r\n      circumstances seemed entirely unabated he said little and\r\n      that moodily and with evident effort i ventured a jest or two\r\n      and he made a sickening attempt at a smile poor fellowas i\r\n      thought of his wife i wondered that he could have heart to put\r\n      on even the semblance of mirth i determined to commence a series\r\n      of covert insinuations or innuendoes about the oblong boxjust\r\n      to let him perceive gradually that i was not altogether the\r\n      butt or victim of his little bit of pleasant mystification my\r\n      first observation was by way of opening a masked battery i said\r\n      something about the peculiar shape of that box and as i\r\n      spoke the words i smiled knowingly winked and touched him\r\n      gently with my forefinger in the ribs\r\n\r\n      the manner in which wyatt received this harmless pleasantry\r\n      convinced me at once that he was mad at first he stared at me\r\n      as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my\r\n      remark but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his\r\n      brain his eyes in the same proportion seemed protruding from\r\n      their sockets then he grew very redthen hideously palethen as\r\n      if highly amused with what i had insinuated he began a loud and\r\n      boisterous laugh which to my astonishment he kept up with\r\n      gradually increasing vigor for ten minutes or more in\r\n      conclusion he fell flat and heavily upon the deck when i ran to\r\n      uplift him to all appearance he was dead\r\n\r\n      i called assistance and with much difficulty we brought him to\r\n      himself upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time at\r\n      length we bled him and put him to bed the next morning he was\r\n      quite recovered so far as regarded his mere bodily health of\r\n      his mind i say nothing of course i avoided him during the rest\r\n      of the passage by advice of the captain who seemed to coincide\r\n      with me altogether in my views of his insanity but cautioned me\r\n      to say nothing on this head to any person on board\r\n\r\n      several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of\r\n      wyatt which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which i\r\n      was already possessed among other things this i had been\r\n      nervousdrank too much strong green tea and slept ill at\r\n      nightin fact for two nights i could not be properly said to\r\n      sleep at all now my stateroom opened into the main cabin or\r\n      diningroom as did those of all the single men on board wyatts\r\n      three rooms were in the aftercabin which was separated from the\r\n      main one by a slight sliding door never locked even at night as\r\n      we were almost constantly on a wind and the breeze was not a\r\n      little stiff the ship heeled to leeward very considerably and\r\n      whenever her starboard side was to leeward the sliding door\r\n      between the cabins slid open and so remained nobody taking the\r\n      trouble to get up and shut it but my berth was in such a\r\n      position that when my own stateroom door was open as well as\r\n      the sliding door in question and my own door was always open on\r\n      account of the heat i could see into the aftercabin quite\r\n      distinctly and just at that portion of it too where were\r\n      situated the staterooms of mr wyatt well during two nights\r\n      not consecutive while i lay awake i clearly saw mrs w about\r\n      eleven oclock upon each night steal cautiously from the\r\n      stateroom of mr w and enter the extra room where she\r\n      remained until daybreak when she was called by her husband and\r\n      went back that they were virtually separated was clear they had\r\n      separate apartmentsno doubt in contemplation of a more permanent\r\n      divorce and here after all i thought was the mystery of the\r\n      extra stateroom\r\n\r\n      there was another circumstance too which interested me much\r\n      during the two wakeful nights in question and immediately after\r\n      the disappearance of mrs wyatt into the extra stateroom i was\r\n      attracted by certain singular cautious subdued noises in that of\r\n      her husband after listening to them for some time with\r\n      thoughtful attention i at length succeeded perfectly in\r\n      translating their import they were sounds occasioned by the\r\n      artist in prying open the oblong box by means of a chisel and\r\n      malletthe latter being apparently muffled or deadened by some\r\n      soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped\r\n\r\n      in this manner i fancied i could distinguish the precise moment\r\n      when he fairly disengaged the lidalso that i could determine\r\n      when he removed it altogether and when he deposited it upon the\r\n      lower berth in his room this latter point i knew for example\r\n      by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the\r\n      wooden edges of the berth as he endeavored to lay it down very\r\n      gentlythere being no room for it on the floor after this there\r\n      was a dead stillness and i heard nothing more upon either\r\n      occasion until nearly daybreak unless perhaps i may mention a\r\n      low sobbing or murmuring sound so very much suppressed as to be\r\n      nearly inaudibleif indeed the whole of this latter noise were\r\n      not rather produced by my own imagination i say it seemed to\r\n      resemble sobbing or sighingbut of course it could not have\r\n      been either i rather think it was a ringing in my own ears mr\r\n      wyatt no doubt according to custom was merely giving the rein\r\n      to one of his hobbiesindulging in one of his fits of artistic\r\n      enthusiasm he had opened his oblong box in order to feast his\r\n      eyes on the pictorial treasure within there was nothing in this\r\n      however to make him sob i repeat therefore that it must have\r\n      been simply a freak of my own fancy distempered by good captain\r\n      hardys green tea just before dawn on each of the two nights of\r\n      which i speak i distinctly heard mr wyatt replace the lid upon\r\n      the oblong box and force the nails into their old places by\r\n      means of the muffled mallet having done this he issued from his\r\n      stateroom fully dressed and proceeded to call mrs w from\r\n      hers\r\n\r\n      we had been at sea seven days and were now off cape hatteras\r\n      when there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest we\r\n      were in a measure prepared for it however as the weather had\r\n      been holding out threats for some time every thing was made\r\n      snug alow and aloft and as the wind steadily freshened we lay\r\n      to at length under spanker and foretopsail both doublereefed\r\n\r\n      in this trim we rode safely enough for fortyeight hoursthe ship\r\n      proving herself an excellent seaboat in many respects and\r\n      shipping no water of any consequence at the end of this period\r\n      however the gale had freshened into a hurricane and our\r\n      aftersail split into ribbons bringing us so much in the trough\r\n      of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas one\r\n      immediately after the other by this accident we lost three men\r\n      overboard with the caboose and nearly the whole of the larboard\r\n      bulwarks scarcely had we recovered our senses before the\r\n      foretopsail went into shreds when we got up a storm staysail\r\n      and with this did pretty well for some hours the ship heading\r\n      the sea much more steadily than before\r\n\r\n      the gale still held on however and we saw no signs of its\r\n      abating the rigging was found to be illfitted and greatly\r\n      strained and on the third day of the blow about five in the\r\n      afternoon our mizzenmast in a heavy lurch to windward went by\r\n      the board for an hour or more we tried in vain to get rid of\r\n      it on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship and before\r\n      we had succeeded the carpenter came aft and announced four feet\r\n      of water in the hold to add to our dilemma we found the pumps\r\n      choked and nearly useless\r\n\r\n      all was now confusion and despairbut an effort was made to\r\n      lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as\r\n      could be reached and by cutting away the two masts that\r\n      remained this we at last accomplishedbut we were still unable\r\n      to do any thing at the pumps and in the meantime the leak\r\n      gained on us very fast\r\n\r\n      at sundown the gale had sensibly diminished in violence and as\r\n      the sea went down with it we still entertained faint hopes of\r\n      saving ourselves in the boats at eight p m the clouds broke\r\n      away to windward and we had the advantage of a full moona piece\r\n      of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our drooping\r\n      spirits\r\n\r\n      after incredible labor we succeeded at length in getting the\r\n      longboat over the side without material accident and into this\r\n      we crowded the whole of the crew and most of the passengers this\r\n      party made off immediately and after undergoing much suffering\r\n      finally arrived in safety at ocracoke inlet on the third day\r\n      after the wreck\r\n\r\n      fourteen passengers with the captain remained on board\r\n      resolving to trust their fortunes to the jollyboat at the stern\r\n      we lowered it without difficulty although it was only by a\r\n      miracle that we prevented it from swamping as it touched the\r\n      water it contained when afloat the captain and his wife mr\r\n      wyatt and party a mexican officer wife four children and\r\n      myself with a negro valet\r\n\r\n      we had no room of course for any thing except a few positively\r\n      necessary instruments some provisions and the clothes upon our\r\n      backs no one had thought of even attempting to save any thing\r\n      more what must have been the astonishment of all then when\r\n      having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship mr wyatt stood up\r\n      in the sternsheets and coolly demanded of captain hardy that\r\n      the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking in his\r\n      oblong box\r\n\r\n      sit down mr wyatt replied the captain somewhat sternly\r\n      you will capsize us if you do not sit quite still our gunwhale\r\n      is almost in the water now\r\n\r\n      the box vociferated mr wyatt still standingthe box i say\r\n      captain hardy you cannot you will not refuse me its weight\r\n      will be but a trifleit is nothingmere nothing by the mother\r\n      who bore youfor the love of heavenby your hope of salvation i\r\n      implore you to put back for the box\r\n\r\n      the captain for a moment seemed touched by the earnest appeal\r\n      of the artist but he regained his stern composure and merely\r\n      said\r\n\r\n      mr wyatt you are mad i cannot listen to you sit down i say\r\n      or you will swamp the boat stayhold himseize himhe is about\r\n      to spring overboard therei knew ithe is over\r\n\r\n      as the captain said this mr wyatt in fact sprang from the\r\n      boat and as we were yet in the lee of the wreck succeeded by\r\n      almost superhuman exertion in getting hold of a rope which hung\r\n      from the forechains in another moment he was on board and\r\n      rushing frantically down into the cabin\r\n\r\n      in the meantime we had been swept astern of the ship and being\r\n      quite out of her lee were at the mercy of the tremendous sea\r\n      which was still running we made a determined effort to put back\r\n      but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the\r\n      tempest we saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate\r\n      artist was sealed\r\n\r\n      as our distance from the wreck rapidly increased the madman for\r\n      as such only could we regard him was seen to emerge from the\r\n      companionway up which by dint of strength that appeared\r\n      gigantic he dragged bodily the oblong box while we gazed in\r\n      the extremity of astonishment he passed rapidly several turns\r\n      of a threeinch rope first around the box and then around his\r\n      body in another instant both body and box were in the\r\n      seadisappearing suddenly at once and forever\r\n\r\n      we lingered awhile sadly upon our oars with our eyes riveted\r\n      upon the spot at length we pulled away the silence remained\r\n      unbroken for an hour finally i hazarded a remark\r\n\r\n      did you observe captain how suddenly they sank was not that\r\n      an exceedingly singular thing i confess that i entertained some\r\n      feeble hope of his final deliverance when i saw him lash himself\r\n      to the box and commit himself to the sea\r\n\r\n      they sank as a matter of course replied the captain and that\r\n      like a shot they will soon rise again howeverbut not till the\r\n      salt melts\r\n\r\n      the salt i ejaculated\r\n\r\n      hush said the captain pointing to the wife and sisters of the\r\n      deceased we must talk of these things at some more appropriate\r\n      time\r\n\r\n      we suffered much and made a narrow escape but fortune\r\n      befriended us as well as our mates in the longboat we landed\r\n      in fine more dead than alive after four days of intense\r\n      distress upon the beach opposite roanoke island we remained\r\n      here a week were not illtreated by the wreckers and at length\r\n      obtained a passage to new york\r\n\r\n      about a month after the loss of the independence i happened to\r\n      meet captain hardy in broadway our conversation turned\r\n      naturally upon the disaster and especially upon the sad fate of\r\n      poor wyatt i thus learned the following particulars\r\n\r\n      the artist had engaged passage for himself wife two sisters and\r\n      a servant his wife was indeed as she had been represented a\r\n      most lovely and most accomplished woman on the morning of the\r\n      fourteenth of june the day in which i first visited the ship\r\n      the lady suddenly sickened and died the young husband was\r\n      frantic with griefbut circumstances imperatively forbade the\r\n      deferring his voyage to new york it was necessary to take to her\r\n      mother the corpse of his adored wife and on the other hand the\r\n      universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so openly was\r\n      well known ninetenths of the passengers would have abandoned\r\n      the ship rather than take passage with a dead body\r\n\r\n      in this dilemma captain hardy arranged that the corpse being\r\n      first partially embalmed and packed with a large quantity of\r\n      salt in a box of suitable dimensions should be conveyed on\r\n      board as merchandise nothing was to be said of the ladys\r\n      decease and as it was well understood that mr wyatt had\r\n      engaged passage for his wife it became necessary that some\r\n      person should personate her during the voyage this the deceased\r\n      ladysmaid was easily prevailed on to do the extra stateroom\r\n      originally engaged for this girl during her mistress life was\r\n      now merely retained in this stateroom the pseudowife slept\r\n      of course every night in the daytime she performed to the best\r\n      of her ability the part of her mistresswhose person it had\r\n      been carefully ascertained was unknown to any of the passengers\r\n      on board\r\n\r\n      my own mistake arose naturally enough through too careless too\r\n      inquisitive and too impulsive a temperament but of late it is\r\n      a rare thing that i sleep soundly at night there is a\r\n      countenance which haunts me turn as i will

     breath\r\n\r\n      the phrases i am out of breath i have lost my breath etc\r\n      are often enough repeated in common conversation but it had\r\n      never occurred to me that the terrible

determined at all events to\r\n      conceal the matter from my wife until further experience should\r\n      discover to me the extent of this my unheard of calamity\r\n      altering my countenance therefore in a moment from its\r\n      bepuffed and distorted appearance to an expression of arch and\r\n      coquettish benignity i gave my lady a pat on the one cheek and\r\n      a kiss on the

stirred with it a feather if my\r\n      life had been at issue or sullied even the delicacy of a mirror\r\n      hard fateyet there was some alleviation to the first\r\n      overwhelming paroxysm of my sorrow i found upon trial that the\r\n      powers of utterance which upon my inability to proceed in the\r\n      conversation with my wife i then concluded to be totally\r\n      destroyed were in fact only partially impeded and i discovered\r\n      that had i at that interesting crisis dropped my voice to a\r\n      singularly deep guttural i might still have continued to her the\r\n      communication of my sentiments this pitch of voice the\r\n      guttural depending i find not upon the current of the breath\r\n      but upon a certain spasmodic action of the muscles of the throat\r\n\r\n      throwing myself upon a chair i remained for some time absorbed\r\n      in meditation my reflections be sure were of no consolatory\r\n      kind a thousand vague and lachrymatory fancies took possession\r\n      of my souland even the idea of suicide flitted across my brain\r\n      but it is a trait in the perversity of human nature to reject the\r\n      obvious and the ready for the fardistant and equivocal thus i\r\n      shuddered at selfmurder as the most decided of atrocities while\r\n      the tabby cat purred strenuously upon the rug and the very\r\n      waterdog wheezed assiduously under the table each taking to\r\n      itself much merit for the strength of its lungs and all\r\n      obviously done in derision of my own pulmonary incapacity\r\n\r\n      oppressed with a tumult of vague hopes and fears i at length\r\n      heard the footsteps of my wife descending the staircase being\r\n      now assured of her absence i returned with a palpitating heart\r\n      to the scene of my disaster\r\n\r\n      carefully locking the door on the inside i commenced a vigorous\r\n      search it was possible i thought that concealed in some\r\n      obscure corner or lurking in some closet or drawer might be\r\n      found the lost object of my inquiry it might have a vaporyit\r\n      might even have a tangible form most philosophers upon

is a case in\r\n      point i would have the judicious reader pause before accusing\r\n      such asseverations of an undue quantum of absurdity anaxagoras\r\n      it will be remembered maintained that snow is black and this i\r\n      have since found to be the case\r\n\r\n      long and earnestly did i continue the investigation but the\r\n      contemptible reward of my industry and perseverance proved to be\r\n      only a set of false teeth two pair of hips an eye and a bundle\r\n      of billetsdoux from mr windenough to my wife i might as well\r\n      here observe that this confirmation of my ladys partiality for\r\n      mr w occasioned me little uneasiness that mrs lackobreath\r\n      should admire anything so dissimilar to myself was a natural and\r\n      necessary evil i am it is well known of a robust and corpulent\r\n      appearance and at the same time somewhat diminutive in stature\r\n      what wonder then that the lathlike tenuity of my acquaintance\r\n      and his altitude which has grown into a proverb should have met\r\n      with all due estimation in the eyes of mrs lackobreath but to\r\n      return\r\n\r\n      my exertions as i have before said proved fruitless closet\r\n      after closetdrawer after drawercorner after cornerwere\r\n      scrutinized to no purpose at one time however i thought myself\r\n      sure of my prize having in rummaging a dressingcase\r\n      accidentally demolished a bottle of grandjeans oil of\r\n      archangelswhich as an agreeable perfume i here take the\r\n      liberty of recommending\r\n\r\n      with a heavy heart i returned to my boudoirthere to ponder upon\r\n      some method of eluding my wifes penetration until i could make\r\n      arrangements prior to my leaving the country for to this i had\r\n      already made up my mind in a foreign climate being unknown i\r\n      might with some probability of success endeavor to conceal my\r\n      unhappy calamitya calamity calculated even more than beggary\r\n      to estrange the affections of the multitude and to draw down\r\n      upon the wretch the wellmerited indignation of the virtuous and\r\n      the happy i was not long in hesitation being naturally quick i\r\n      committed to memory the entire tragedy of metamora i had the\r\n      good fortune to recollect that in the accentuation of this drama\r\n      or at least of such portion of it as is allotted to the hero the\r\n      tones of voice in which i found myself deficient were altogether\r\n      unnecessary and the deep guttural was expected to reign\r\n      monotonously throughout\r\n\r\n      i practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented\r\n      marshherein however having no reference to a similar\r\n      proceeding of demosthenes but from a design peculiarly and\r\n      conscientiously my own thus armed at all points i determined to\r\n      make my wife believe that i was suddenly smitten with a passion\r\n      for the stage in this i succeeded to a miracle and to every\r\n      question or suggestion found myself at liberty to reply in my\r\n      most froglike and sepulchral tones with some passage from the\r\n      tragedyany portion of which as i soon took great pleasure in\r\n      observing would apply equally well to any particular subject it\r\n      is not to be supposed however that in the delivery of such\r\n      passages i was found at all deficient in the looking asquintthe\r\n      showing my teeththe working my kneesthe shuffling my feetor in\r\n      any of those unmentionable graces which are now justly considered\r\n      the characteristics of a popular performer to be sure they spoke\r\n      of confining me in a straitjacketbut good god they never\r\n      suspected me of having lost my breath\r\n\r\n      having at length put my affairs in order i took my seat very\r\n      early one morning in the mail stage for  giving it to be\r\n      understood among my acquaintances that business of the last\r\n      importance required my immediate personal attendance in that\r\n      city\r\n\r\n      the coach was crammed to repletion but in the uncertain twilight\r\n      the features of my companions could not be distinguished without\r\n      making any effectual resistance i suffered myself to be placed\r\n      between two gentlemen of colossal dimensions while a third of a\r\n      size larger requesting pardon for the liberty he was about to\r\n      take threw himself upon my body at full length and falling\r\n      asleep in an instant drowned all my guttural ejaculations for\r\n      relief in a snore which would have put to blush the roarings of\r\n      the bull of phalaris happily the state of my respiratory\r\n      faculties rendered suffocation an accident entirely out of the\r\n      question\r\n\r\n      as however the day broke more distinctly in our approach to the\r\n      outskirts of the city my tormentor arising and adjusting his\r\n      shirtcollar thanked me in a very friendly manner for my\r\n      civility seeing that i remained motionless all my limbs were\r\n      dislocated and my head twisted on one side his apprehensions\r\n      began to be excited and arousing the rest of the passengers he\r\n      communicated in a very decided manner his opinion that a dead\r\n      man had been palmed upon them during the night for a living and\r\n      responsible fellowtraveller here giving me a thump on the right\r\n      eye by way of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion\r\n\r\n      hereupon all one after another there were nine in company\r\n      believed it their duty to pull me by the ear a young practising\r\n      physician too having applied a pocketmirror to my mouth and\r\n      found me without breath the assertion of my persecutor was\r\n      pronounced a true bill and the whole party expressed a\r\n      determination to endure tamely no such impositions for the\r\n      future and to proceed no farther with any such carcasses for the\r\n      present\r\n\r\n      i was here accordingly thrown out at the sign of the crow by\r\n      which tavern the coach happened to be passing without meeting\r\n      with any farther accident than the breaking of both my arms\r\n      under the left hind wheel of the vehicle i must besides do the\r\n      driver the justice to state that he did not forget to throw after\r\n      me the largest of my trunks which unfortunately falling on my\r\n      head fractured my skull in a manner at once interesting and\r\n      extraordinary\r\n\r\n      the landlord of the crow who is a hospitable man finding that\r\n      my trunk contained sufficient to indemnify him for any little\r\n      trouble he might take in my behalf sent forthwith for a surgeon\r\n      of his acquaintance and delivered me to his care with a bill and\r\n      receipt for ten dollars\r\n\r\n      the purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced operations\r\n      immediately having cut off my ears however he discovered signs\r\n      of animation he now rang the bell and sent for a neighboring\r\n      apothecary with whom to consult in the emergency in case of his\r\n      suspicions with regard to my existence proving ultimately\r\n      correct he in the meantime made an incision in my stomach and\r\n      removed several of my viscera for private dissection\r\n\r\n      the apothecary had an idea that i was actually dead this idea i\r\n      endeavored to confute kicking and plunging with all my might\r\n      and making the most furious contortionsfor the operations of the\r\n      surgeon had in a measure restored me to the possession of my\r\n      faculties all however was attributed to the effects of a new\r\n      galvanic battery wherewith the apothecary who is really a man\r\n      of information performed several curious experiments in which\r\n      from my personal share in their fulfillment i could not help\r\n      feeling deeply interested it was a course of mortification to\r\n      me nevertheless that although i made several attempts at\r\n      conversation my powers of speech were so entirely in abeyance\r\n      that i could not even open my mouth much less then make reply\r\n      to some ingenious but fanciful theories of which under other\r\n      circumstances my minute acquaintance with the hippocratian\r\n      pathology would have afforded me a ready confutation\r\n\r\n      not being able to arrive at a conclusion the practitioners\r\n      remanded me for farther examination i was taken up into a\r\n      garret and the surgeons lady having accommodated me with\r\n      drawers and stockings the surgeon himself fastened my hands and\r\n      tied up my jaws with a pockethandkerchiefthen bolted the door\r\n      on the outside as he hurried to his dinner leaving me alone to\r\n      silence and to meditation\r\n\r\n      i now discovered to my extreme delight that i could have spoken\r\n      had not my mouth been tied up with the pockethandkerchief\r\n      consoling myself with this reflection i was mentally repeating\r\n      some passages of the omnipresence of the deity as is my custom\r\n      before resigning myself to sleep when two cats of a greedy and\r\n      vituperative turn entering at a hole in the wall leaped up with\r\n      a flourish a la catalani and alighting opposite one another on\r\n      my visage betook themselves to indecorous contention for the\r\n      paltry consideration of my nose\r\n\r\n      but as the loss of his ears proved the means of elevating to the\r\n      throne of cyrus the magian or migegush of persia and as the\r\n      cutting off his nose gave zopyrus possession of babylon so the\r\n      loss of a few ounces of my countenance proved the salvation of my\r\n      body aroused by the pain and burning with indignation i burst\r\n      at a single effort the fastenings and the bandage stalking\r\n      across the room i cast a glance of contempt at the belligerents\r\n      and throwing open the sash to their extreme horror and\r\n      disappointment precipitated myself very dexterously from the\r\n      window\r\n\r\n      the mailrobber w to whom i bore a singular resemblance was\r\n      at this moment passing from the city jail to the scaffold erected\r\n      for his execution in the suburbs his extreme infirmity and long\r\n      continued ill health had obtained him the privilege of remaining\r\n      unmanacled and habited in his gallows costumeone very similar\r\n      to my ownhe lay at full length in the bottom of the hangmans\r\n      cart which happened to be under the windows of the surgeon at\r\n      the moment of my precipitation without any other guard than the\r\n      driver who was asleep and two recruits of the sixth infantry\r\n      who were drunk\r\n\r\n      as illluck would have it i alit upon my feet within the\r\n      vehicle w who was an acute fellow perceived his opportunity\r\n      leaping up immediately he bolted out behind and turning down an\r\n      alley was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye the recruits\r\n      aroused by the bustle could not exactly comprehend the merits of\r\n      the transaction seeing however a man the precise counterpart\r\n      of the felon standing upright in the cart before their eyes\r\n      they were of the opinion that the rascal meaning w was after\r\n      making his escape so they expressed themselves and having\r\n      communicated this opinion to one another they took each a dram\r\n      and then knocked me down with the buttends of their muskets\r\n\r\n      it was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination of\r\n      course nothing could be said in my defence hanging was my\r\n      inevitable fate i resigned myself thereto with a feeling half\r\n      stupid half acrimonious being little of a cynic i had all the\r\n      sentiments of a dog the hangman however adjusted the noose\r\n      about my neck the drop fell\r\n\r\n      i forbear to depict my sensations upon the gallows although\r\n      here undoubtedly i could speak to the point and it is a topic\r\n      upon which nothing has been well said in fact to write upon\r\n      such a theme it is necessary to have been hanged every author\r\n      should confine himself to matters of experience thus mark antony\r\n      composed a treatise upon getting drunk\r\n\r\n      i may just mention however that die i did not my body was but\r\n      i had no breath to be suspended and but for the knot under my\r\n      left ear which had the feel of a military stock i dare say that\r\n      i should have experienced very little inconvenience as for the\r\n      jerk given to my neck upon the falling of the drop it merely\r\n      proved a corrective to the twist afforded me by the fat gentleman\r\n      in the coach\r\n\r\n      for good reasons however i did my best to give the crowd the\r\n      worth of their trouble my convulsions were said to be\r\n      extraordinary my spasms it would have been difficult to beat\r\n      the populace

as\r\n      the real culprit had in the meantime been retaken and recognized\r\n      a fact which i was so unlucky as not to know\r\n\r\n      much sympathy was of course exercised in my behalf and as no\r\n      one made claim to my corpse it was ordered that i should be\r\n      interred in a public vault\r\n\r\n      here after due interval i was deposited the sexton departed\r\n      and i was left alone a line of marstons malcontent\r\n\r\n      deaths a good fellow and keeps open house\r\n\r\n      struck me at that moment as a palpable lie\r\n\r\n      i knocked off however the lid of my coffin and stepped out\r\n      the place was dreadfully dreary and damp and i became troubled\r\n      with ennui by way of amusement i felt my way among the numerous\r\n      coffins ranged in order around i lifted them down one by one\r\n      and breaking open their lids busied myself in speculations about\r\n      the mortality within\r\n\r\n      this i soliloquized tumbling over a

actuated by that habitual prudence which\r\n      has ever been my predominating trait i reflected that many\r\n      difficulties might still lie in the path of my preservation which\r\n      only

not this be the case with mr\r\n      windenough in displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was\r\n      at present so willing to get rid might i not lay myself open to\r\n      the exactions of his avarice there are scoundrels in this world\r\n      i remembered with a sigh who will not scruple to take unfair\r\n      opportunities with even a next door neighbor and this remark is\r\n      from epictetus it is precisely at that time when men are most\r\n      anxious to throw off the burden of their own calamities that they\r\n      feel the least desirous of relieving them in others\r\n\r\n      upon considerations similar to these and still retaining my\r\n      grasp upon the nose of mr w i accordingly thought proper to\r\n      model my reply\r\n\r\n      monster i

respiration\r\n\r\n      like brutus i paused for a replywith which like a tornado mr\r\n      windenough immediately overwhelmed me protestation followed upon\r\n      protestation and apology upon apology there were no terms with\r\n      which he was unwilling to comply and there were none of which i\r\n      failed to take the fullest advantage\r\n\r\n      preliminaries being at length arranged my acquaintance delivered\r\n      me the respiration for which having carefully examined it i\r\n      gave him afterward a receipt\r\n\r\n      i am aware that by many i shall be held to

delicate i repeat and\r\n      at the time involving the interests of a third party whose\r\n      sulphurous resentment i have not the least desire at this\r\n      moment of incurring\r\n\r\n      we were not long after this necessary arrangement in effecting an\r\n      escape from the dungeons of the sepulchre the united strength of\r\n      our resuscitated voices was soon sufficiently

have been decidedly in the wrong\r\n\r\n      i cannot conclude these details of some very singular passages in\r\n      a life at all times sufficiently eventful without again\r\n      recalling to the attention of the reader the merits of that\r\n      indiscriminate philosophy which is a sure and ready shield\r\n      against those shafts of calamity which can neither be seen felt\r\n      nor fully understood it was in the spirit of this wisdom that\r\n      among the ancient hebrews it was believed the gates of heaven\r\n      would be inevitably opened to that sinner or saint who with\r\n      good lungs and implicit confidence should vociferate the word\r\n      amen it was in the spirit of this wisdom that when a great\r\n      plague raged at athens and every means had been

brevet brigadier\r\n      general john a b c smith some one did introduce me to the\r\n      gentleman i am sureat some public meeting i know very\r\n      wellheld about something of great importance no doubtat some\r\n      place or other i feel convincedwhose name i have unaccountably\r\n      forgotten the truth isthat the introduction was attended upon\r\n      my part with a degree of anxious embarrassment which operated to\r\n      prevent any definite impressions of either time or place i am\r\n      constitutionally nervousthis with me is a family failing and\r\n      i cant help it in especial the slightest appearance of\r\n      mysteryof any point i cannot exactly comprehendputs me at once\r\n      into a pitiable state of agitation\r\n\r\n      there was something as it were remarkableyes remarkable\r\n      although this is but a feeble term to express my full\r\n      meaningabout the entire individuality of the personage in\r\n      question he was perhaps six feet in height and of a presence\r\n      singularly commanding there was an air distingué pervading the\r\n      whole man which spoke of high breeding and hinted at high\r\n      birth upon this topicthe topic of smiths personal appearancei\r\n      have a kind of melancholy satisfaction in being minute his head\r\n      of hair would have done honor to a brutus nothing could be more\r\n      richly flowing or possess a brighter gloss it was of a jetty\r\n      blackwhich was also the color or more properly the no color of\r\n      his unimaginable whiskers you perceive i cannot speak of these\r\n      latter without enthusiasm it is not too much to say that they\r\n      were the handsomest pair of whiskers under the sun at all\r\n      events they encircled and at times partially overshadowed a\r\n      mouth utterly unequalled here were the most entirely even and\r\n      the most brilliantly white of all conceivable teeth from between\r\n      them upon every proper occasion issued a voice of surpassing\r\n      clearness melody and strength in the matter of eyes also my\r\n      acquaintance was preeminently endowed either one of such a pair\r\n      was worth a couple of the ordinary ocular organs they were of a\r\n      deep hazel exceedingly large and lustrous and there was\r\n      perceptible about them ever and anon just that amount of\r\n      interesting obliquity which gives pregnancy to expression\r\n\r\n      the bust of the general was unquestionably the finest bust i ever\r\n      saw for your life you could not have found a fault with its\r\n      wonderful proportion this rare peculiarity set off to great\r\n      advantage a pair of shoulders which would have called up a blush\r\n      of conscious inferiority into the countenance of the marble\r\n      apollo i have a passion for fine shoulders and may say that i\r\n      never beheld them in perfection before the arms altogether were\r\n      admirably modelled nor were the lower limbs less superb these\r\n      were indeed the ne plus ultra of good legs every connoisseur\r\n      in such matters admitted the legs to be good there was neither\r\n      too much flesh nor too littleneither rudeness nor fragility i\r\n      could not imagine a more graceful curve than that of the os\r\n      femoris and there was just that due gentle prominence in the\r\n      rear of the fibula which goes to the conformation of a properly\r\n      proportioned calf i wish to god my young and talented friend\r\n      chiponchipino the sculptor had but seen the legs of brevet\r\n      brigadier general john a b c smith\r\n\r\n      but although men so absolutely finelooking are neither as plenty\r\n      as reasons or blackberries still i could not bring myself to\r\n      believe that the remarkable something to which i alluded just\r\n      nowthat the odd air of je ne sais quoi which hung about my\r\n      new acquaintancelay altogether or indeed at all in the\r\n      supreme excellence of his bodily endowments perhaps it might be\r\n      traced to the manneryet here again i could not pretend to be\r\n      positive there was a primness not to say stiffness in his\r\n      carriagea degree of measured and if i may so express it of\r\n      rectangular precision attending his every movement which\r\n      observed in a more diminutive figure would have had the least\r\n      little savor in the world of affectation pomposity or\r\n      constraint but which noticed in a gentleman of his undoubted\r\n      dimensions was readily placed to the account of reserve\r\n      hauteurof a commendable sense in short of what is due to the\r\n      dignity of colossal proportion\r\n\r\n      the kind friend who presented me to general smith whispered in my\r\n      ear some few words of comment upon the man he was a remarkable\r\n      mana very remarkable manindeed one of the most remarkable\r\n      men of the age he was an especial favorite too with the\r\n      ladieschiefly on account of his high reputation for courage\r\n\r\n      in that point he is unrivalledindeed he is a perfect\r\n      desperadoa downright fireeater and no mistake said my\r\n      friend here dropping his voice excessively low and thrilling me\r\n      with the mystery of his tone\r\n\r\n      a downright fireeater and no mistake showed that i\r\n      should say to some purpose in the late tremendous swampfight\r\n      away down south with the bugaboo and kickapoo indians here my\r\n      friend opened his eyes to some extent bless my soulblood and\r\n      thunder and all thatprodigies of valorheard of him of\r\n      courseyou know hes the man\r\n\r\n      man alive how do you do why how are ye very glad to\r\n      see ye indeed here interrupted the general himself seizing my\r\n      companion by the hand as he drew near and bowing stiffly but\r\n      profoundly as i was presented i then thought and i think so\r\n      still that i never heard a clearer nor a stronger voice nor\r\n      beheld a finer set of teeth but i must say that i was sorry\r\n      for the interruption just at that moment as owing to the\r\n      whispers and insinuations aforesaid my interest had been greatly\r\n      excited in the hero of the bugaboo and kickapoo campaign\r\n\r\n      however the delightfully luminous conversation of brevet\r\n      brigadier general john a b c smith soon completely dissipated\r\n      this chagrin my friend leaving us immediately we had quite a\r\n      long têteàtête and i was not only pleased but\r\n      reallyinstructed i never heard a more fluent talker or a man\r\n      of greater general information with becoming modesty he\r\n      forebore nevertheless to touch upon the theme i had just then\r\n      most at hearti mean the mysterious circumstances attending the\r\n      bugaboo warand on my own part what i conceive to be a proper\r\n      sense of delicacy forbade me to broach the subject although in\r\n      truth i was exceedingly tempted to do so i perceived too that\r\n      the gallant soldier preferred topics of philosophical interest\r\n      and that he delighted especially in commenting upon the rapid\r\n      march of mechanical invention indeed lead him where i would\r\n      this was a point to which he invariably came back\r\n\r\n      there is nothing at all like it he would say we are a\r\n      wonderful people and live in a wonderful age parachutes and\r\n      railroadsmantraps and springguns our steamboats are upon\r\n      every sea and the nassau balloon

and ahahaharound us\r\n\r\n      thompson to be sure is not my name but it is needless to say\r\n      that i left general smith with a heightened interest in the man\r\n      with an exalted opinion of his conversational powers and a deep\r\n      sense of the valuable privileges we enjoy in living in this age\r\n      of mechanical invention my curiosity however had not been\r\n      altogether satisfied and i resolved to prosecute immediate\r\n      inquiry among my acquaintances touching the brevet brigadier\r\n      general himself and particularly respecting the tremendous\r\n      events quorum pars magna fuit during the bugaboo and kickapoo\r\n      campaign\r\n\r\n      the first opportunity which presented itself and which\r\n      horresco referens i did not in the least scruple to seize\r\n      occurred at the church of the reverend doctor drummummupp where\r\n      i found myself established one sunday just at sermon time not\r\n      only in the pew but by the side of that worthy and\r\n      communicative little friend of mine miss tabitha t thus seated\r\n      i congratulated myself and with much reason upon the very\r\n      flattering state of affairs if any person knew anything about\r\n      brevet brigadier general john a b c smith that person it was\r\n      clear to me was miss tabitha t we telegraphed a few signals\r\n      and then commenced sotto voce a brisk têteàtête\r\n\r\n      smith said she in reply to my very earnest inquiry\r\n      smithwhy not general john a b c bless me i thought you\r\n      knew all about him this is a wonderfully inventive age\r\n      horrid affair thata bloody set of wretches those\r\n      kickapoosfought like a heroprodigies of valorimmortal renown\r\n      smithbrevet brigadier general john a

that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live\r\n      he cometh up and is cut down like a flower i started to the\r\n      extremity of the pew and perceived by the animated looks of the\r\n      divine that the wrath which had nearly proved fatal to the\r\n      pulpit had been excited by the whispers of the lady and myself\r\n      there was no help for it so i submitted with a good grace and\r\n      listened in all the martyrdom of dignified silence to the\r\n      balance of that very capital discourse\r\n\r\n      next evening found me a somewhat late visitor at the rantipole\r\n      theatre where i felt sure of satisfying my curiosity at once by\r\n      merely stepping into the box of those exquisite specimens of\r\n      affability and omniscience the misses arabella and miranda\r\n      cognoscenti that fine tragedian climax was doing iago to a\r\n      very crowded house and i experienced some little difficulty in\r\n      making my wishes understood especially as our box was next the\r\n      slips and completely overlooked the stage\r\n\r\n      smith said miss arabella as she at length comprehended the\r\n      purport of my query smithwhy not general john a b c\r\n\r\n      smith inquired miranda musingly god bless me did you ever\r\n      behold a finer figure\r\n\r\n      never madam but do tell me\r\n\r\n      or so inimitable

spirit of animosity against the whole race of the\r\n      basbleus\r\n\r\n      matters had now assumed a really serious aspect and i resolved\r\n      to call at once upon my particular friend mr

left the house at once in high dudgeon with a firm resolve to\r\n      call my friend mr sinivate to a speedy account for his\r\n      ungentlemanly conduct and illbreeding\r\n\r\n      in the meantime however i had no notion of being thwarted\r\n      touching the information i desired there was one resource left\r\n      me yet i would go to the fountainhead i would call forthwith\r\n      upon the general himself and demand in explicit terms a\r\n      solution of this abominable piece of mystery here at least\r\n      there should be no chance for equivocation i would be plain\r\n      positive peremptoryas short as piecrustas concise as tacitus\r\n      or montesquieu\r\n\r\n      it was early when i called and the general was dressing but i\r\n      pleaded urgent business and was shown at once into his bedroom\r\n      by an old negro valet who remained in attendance during my\r\n      visit as i entered the chamber i looked about of course for\r\n      the occupant but did not immediately perceive him there was a\r\n      large and exceedingly oddlooking bundle of something which lay\r\n      close by my feet on the floor and as i was not in the best\r\n      humor in the world i gave it a kick out of the way\r\n\r\n      hem ahem rather civil that i should say said the bundle in\r\n      one of the smallest and altogether the funniest little voices\r\n      between a squeak and a whistle that i ever heard in all the days\r\n      of my existence\r\n\r\n      ahem rather civil that i should observe\r\n\r\n      i fairly shouted with terror and made off at a tangent into\r\n      the farthest extremity of the room\r\n\r\n      god bless me my dear fellow here again whistled the bundle\r\n      whatwhatwhatwhy what is the matter i really believe you\r\n      dont know me at all\r\n\r\n      what could i say to all thiswhat could i i staggered into\r\n      an armchair and with staring eyes and open mouth awaited the\r\n      solution of the wonder\r\n\r\n      strange you shouldnt know me though isnt it presently\r\n      resqueaked the nondescript which i now perceived was\r\n      performing upon the floor some inexplicable evolution very\r\n      analogous to the drawing on of a stocking there was only a\r\n      single leg however apparent\r\n\r\n      strange you shouldnt know me though isnt it pompey bring\r\n      me that leg here pompey handed the bundle a very capital cork\r\n      leg already dressed which it screwed on in a trice and then it\r\n      stood up before my eyes\r\n\r\n      and a bloody action it was continued the thing as if in a\r\n      soliloquy but then one mustnt fight with the bugaboos and\r\n      kickapoos and think of coming off with a mere scratch pompey\r\n      ill thank you now for that arm thomas turning to me is\r\n      decidedly the best hand at a cork leg but if you should ever\r\n      want an arm my dear fellow you must really let me recommend you\r\n      to bishop here pompey screwed on an arm\r\n\r\n      we had rather hot work of it that you may say now you dog\r\n      slip on my shoulders and bosom pettitt makes the best shoulders\r\n      but for a bosom you will have to go to ducrow\r\n\r\n      bosom said i\r\n\r\n      pompey will you never be ready with that wig scalping is a\r\n      rough process after all but then you can procure such a capital\r\n      scratch at de lormes\r\n\r\n      scratch\r\n\r\n      now you nigger my teeth for a good set of these you had\r\n      better go to parmlys at once high prices but excellent work i\r\n      swallowed some very capital articles though when the big\r\n      bugaboo rammed me down with the butt end of his rifle\r\n\r\n      butt end ram down my eye\r\n\r\n      o yes bytheby my eyehere pompey you scamp screw it in \r\n      those kickapoos are not so very slow at a gouge but hes a\r\n      belied man that dr williams after all you cant imagine how\r\n      well i see with the eyes of his make\r\n\r\n      i now began very clearly to perceive that the object before me\r\n      was nothing more nor less than my new acquaintance brevet\r\n      brigadier general john a b c smith the manipulations of\r\n      pompey had made i must confess a very striking difference in\r\n      the appearance of the personal man the voice however still\r\n      puzzled me no little but even this apparent mystery was speedily\r\n      cleared up\r\n\r\n      pompey you black rascal squeaked the general i really do\r\n      believe you would let me go out without my palate\r\n\r\n      hereupon the negro grumbling out an apology went up to his\r\n      master opened his mouth with the knowing air of a horsejockey\r\n      and adjusted therein a somewhat singularlooking machine in a\r\n      very dexterous manner that i could not altogether comprehend\r\n      the alteration however in the entire expression of the\r\n      generals countenance was instantaneous and surprising when he\r\n      again spoke his voice had resumed all that rich melody and\r\n      strength which i had noticed upon our original introduction\r\n\r\n      dn the vagabonds said he in so clear a tone that i\r\n      positively started at the change dn the vagabonds they not\r\n      only knocked in the roof of my mouth but took the trouble to cut\r\n      off at least seveneighths of my tongue there isnt bonfantis\r\n      equal however in america for really good articles of this\r\n      description i can recommend you to him with confidence here\r\n      the general bowed and assure you that i have the greatest\r\n      pleasure in so doing\r\n\r\n      i acknowledged his kindness in my best manner and took leave of\r\n      him at once with a perfect understanding of the true state of\r\n      affairswith a full comprehension of the mystery which had\r\n      troubled me so long it was evident it was a clear case brevet\r\n      brigadier general john a b c smith was the manwas the man\r\n      that was used up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe business man\r\n\r\n\r\nmethod is the soul of businessold saying\r\n\r\n      i am a business man i am a methodical man method is the thing\r\n      after all but there are no people i more heartily despise than\r\n      your eccentric fools who prate about method without understanding\r\n      it attending strictly to its letter and violating its spirit\r\n      these fellows are always doing the most outoftheway things in\r\n      what they call an orderly manner now here i conceive is a\r\n      positive paradox true method appertains to the ordinary and the\r\n      obvious alone and cannot be applied to the outré what\r\n      definite idea can a body attach to such expressions as\r\n      methodical jack o dandy or a systematical will o the wisp\r\n\r\n      my notions upon this head might not have been so clear as they\r\n      are but for a fortunate accident which happened to me when i was\r\n      a very little boy a goodhearted old irish nurse whom i shall\r\n      not forget in my will took me up one day by the heels when i\r\n      was making more noise than was necessary and swinging me round\r\n      two or three times dd my eyes for a skreeking little\r\n      spalpeen and then knocked my head into a cocked hat against the\r\n      bedpost this i say decided my fate and made my fortune a\r\n      bump arose at once on my sinciput and turned out to be as pretty\r\n      an organ of order as one shall see on a summers day hence that\r\n      positive appetite for system and regularity which has made me the\r\n      distinguished man of business that i am\r\n\r\n      if there is any thing on earth i hate it is a genius your\r\n      geniuses are all arrant assesthe greater the genius the greater\r\n      the assand to this rule there is no exception whatever\r\n      especially you cannot make a man of business out of a genius\r\n      any more than money out of a jew or the best nutmegs out of\r\n      pineknots the creatures are always going off at a tangent into\r\n      some fantastic employment or ridiculous speculation entirely at\r\n      variance with the fitness of things and having no business\r\n      whatever to be considered as a business at all thus you may tell\r\n      these characters immediately by the nature of their occupations\r\n      if you ever perceive a man setting up as a merchant or a\r\n      manufacturer or going into the cotton or tobacco trade or any\r\n      of those eccentric pursuits or getting to be a drygoods dealer\r\n      or soapboiler or something of that kind or pretending to be a\r\n      lawyer or a blacksmith or a physicianany thing out of the\r\n      usual wayyou may set him down at once as a genius and then\r\n      according to the ruleofthree hes an ass\r\n\r\n      now i am not in any respect a genius but a regular business man\r\n      my daybook and ledger will evince this in a minute they are\r\n      well kept though i say it myself and in my general habits of\r\n      accuracy and punctuality i am not to be beat by a clock\r\n      moreover my occupations have been always made to chime in with\r\n      the ordinary habitudes of my fellowmen not that i feel the least\r\n      indebted upon this score to my exceedingly weakminded parents\r\n      who beyond doubt would have made an arrant genius of me at\r\n      last if my guardian angel had not come in good time to the\r\n      rescue in biography the truth is every thing and in\r\n      autobiography it is especially soyet i scarcely hope to be\r\n      believed when i state however solemnly that my poor father put\r\n      me when i was about fifteen years of age into the\r\n      countinghouse of what be termed a respectable hardware and\r\n      commission merchant doing a capital bit of business a capital\r\n      bit of fiddlestick however the consequence of this folly was\r\n      that in two or three days i had to be sent home to my\r\n      buttonheaded family in a high state of fever and with a most\r\n      violent and dangerous pain in the sinciput all around about my\r\n      organ of order it was nearly a gone case with me thenjust\r\n      touchandgo for six weeksthe physicians giving me up and all\r\n      that sort of thing but although i suffered much i was a\r\n      thankful boy in the main i was saved from being a respectable\r\n      hardware and commission merchant doing a capital bit of\r\n      business and i felt grateful to the protuberance which had been\r\n      the means of my salvation as well as to the kindhearted female\r\n      who had originally put these means within my reach\r\n\r\n      the most of boys run away from home at ten or twelve years of\r\n      age but i waited till i was sixteen i dont know that i should\r\n      have gone even then if i had not happened to hear my old mother\r\n      talk about setting me up on my own hook in the grocery way the\r\n      grocery wayonly think of that i resolved to be off forthwith\r\n      and try and establish myself in some decent occupation without\r\n      dancing attendance any longer upon the caprices of these\r\n      eccentric old people and running the risk of being made a genius\r\n      of in the end in this project i succeeded perfectly well at the\r\n      first effort and by the time i was fairly eighteen found myself\r\n      doing an extensive and profitable business in the tailors\r\n      walkingadvertisement line\r\n\r\n      i was enabled to discharge the onerous duties of this profession\r\n      only by that rigid adherence to system which formed the leading\r\n      feature of my mind a scrupulous method characterized my actions\r\n      as well as my accounts in my case it was methodnot moneywhich\r\n      made the man at least all of him that was not made by the tailor\r\n      whom i served at nine every morning i called upon

handsome person\r\n      about so as to bring successively into view every portion of the\r\n      suit upon my back was the admiration of all the knowing men in\r\n      the trade noon never passed

price for that dickey it was one of the\r\n      cleanest and prettiest little dickeys i ever saw and i have good\r\n      reason to believe that it effected the sale of three petershams\r\n      the elder partner of the firm however would allow me only one\r\n      penny of the charge and took it upon himself to show in what\r\n      manner four of the same sized conveniences could be got out of a\r\n      sheet of foolscap but it is needless to say that i stood upon\r\n      the principle of the thing business is business and should be\r\n      done in a business way there was no system whatever in swindling\r\n      me out of a pennya clear fraud of fifty per centno method in\r\n      any respect i left at once the employment of messrs cut \r\n      comeagain and set up in the eyesore line by myselfone of the\r\n      most lucrative respectable and independent of the ordinary\r\n      occupations\r\n\r\n      my strict integrity economy and rigorous business habits here\r\n      again came into play i found myself driving a flourishing trade\r\n      and soon became a marked man upon change the truth is i never\r\n      dabbled in flashy matters but jogged on in the good old sober\r\n      routine of the callinga calling in which i should no doubt\r\n      have remained to the present hour but for a little accident\r\n      which happened to me in the prosecution of one of the usual\r\n      business operations of the profession whenever a rich old hunks\r\n      or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets into the notion of\r\n      putting up a palace there is no such thing in the world as\r\n      stopping either of them and this every intelligent person knows\r\n      the fact in question is indeed the basis of the eyesore trade\r\n      as soon therefore as a buildingproject is fairly afoot by one\r\n      of these parties we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in\r\n      contemplation or a prime little situation just adjoining or\r\n      tight in front this done we wait until the palace is halfway\r\n      up and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an\r\n      ornamental mud hovel right against it or a downeast or dutch\r\n      pagoda or a pigsty or an ingenious little bit of fancy work\r\n      either esquimau kickapoo or hottentot of course we cant\r\n      afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five\r\n      hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster can\r\n      we i ask the question i ask it of business men it would be\r\n      irrational to suppose that we can and yet there was a rascally\r\n      corporation which asked me to do this very thingthis very thing\r\n      i did not reply to their absurd proposition of course but i\r\n      felt it a duty to go that same night and lampblack the whole of\r\n      their palace for this the unreasonable villains clapped me into\r\n      jail and the gentlemen of the eyesore trade could not well\r\n      avoid cutting my connection when i came out\r\n\r\n      the assaultandbattery business into which i was now forced to\r\n      adventure for a livelihood was somewhat illadapted to the\r\n      delicate nature of my constitution but i went to work in it with\r\n      a good heart and found my account here as heretofore in those\r\n      stern habits of methodical accuracy which had been thumped into\r\n      me by that delightful old nursei would indeed be the basest of\r\n      men not to remember her well in my will by observing as i say\r\n      the strictest system in all my dealings and keeping a\r\n      wellregulated set of books i was enabled to get over many\r\n      serious difficulties and in the end to establish myself very\r\n      decently in the profession the truth is that

the reader that these\r\n      extracts are taken at random from my daybook\r\n\r\n      its an old saying and a true one however that money is\r\n      nothing in comparison with health i found the exactions of the\r\n      profession somewhat too much for my delicate state of body and\r\n      discovering at last that i was knocked all out of shape so\r\n      that i didnt know very well what to make of the matter and so\r\n      that my friends when they met me in the street couldnt tell\r\n      that i was peter proffit at all it occurred to me that the best\r\n      expedient i could adopt was to alter my line of business i\r\n      turned my attention therefore to muddabbling and continued it\r\n      for some years\r\n\r\n      the worst of this occupation is that too many people take a\r\n      fancy to it and the competition is in consequence excessive\r\n      every ignoramus of a fellow who finds that he hasnt brains in\r\n      sufficient quantity to make his way as a walking advertiser or\r\n      an eyesore prig or a saltandbatter man thinks of course\r\n      that hell answer very well as a dabbler of mud but there never\r\n      was entertained a more erroneous idea than that it requires no\r\n      brains to muddabble especially there is nothing to be made in\r\n      this way without method i did only a retail business myself but\r\n      my old habits of system carried me swimmingly along i selected\r\n      my streetcrossing in the first place with great deliberation\r\n      and i never put down a broom in any part of the town but that i\r\n      took care too to have a nice little puddle at hand which i\r\n      could get at in a minute by these means i got to be well known\r\n      as a man to be trusted and this is onehalf the battle let me\r\n      tell you in trade nobody ever failed to pitch me a copper and\r\n      got over my crossing with a clean pair of pantaloons and as my\r\n      business habits in this respect were sufficiently understood i\r\n      never met with any attempt at imposition i wouldnt have put up\r\n      with it if i had never imposing upon any one myself i suffered\r\n      no one to play the possum with me the frauds of the banks of\r\n      course i couldnt help their suspension put me to ruinous\r\n      inconvenience these however are not individuals but\r\n      corporations and corporations it is very well known have\r\n      neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be damned\r\n\r\n      i was making money at this business when in an evil moment i\r\n      was induced to merge it in the curspatteringa somewhat\r\n      analogous but by no means so respectable a profession my\r\n      location to be sure was an excellent one being central and i\r\n      had capital blacking and brushes my little dog too was quite\r\n      fat and up to all varieties of snuff he had been in the trade a\r\n      long time and i may say understood it our general routine was\r\n      thispompey having rolled himself well in the mud sat upon end\r\n      at the shop door until he observed a dandy approaching in bright\r\n      boots he then proceeded to meet him and gave the wellingtons a\r\n      rub or two with his wool then the dandy swore very much and\r\n      looked about for a bootblack there i was full in his view\r\n      with blacking and brushes it was only a minutes work and then\r\n      came a sixpence this did moderately well for a timein fact i\r\n      was not avaricious but my dog was i allowed him a third of the\r\n      profit but he was advised to insist upon half this i couldnt\r\n      standso we quarrelled and parted\r\n\r\n      i next tried my hand at the organgrinding for a while and may\r\n      say that i made out pretty well it is a plain straightforward\r\n      business and requires no particular abilities you can get a\r\n      musicmill for a mere song and to put it in order you have but\r\n      to open the works and give them three or four smart raps with a\r\n      hammer it improves the tone of the thing for business purposes\r\n      more than you can imagine this done you have only to stroll\r\n      along with the mill on your back until you see tanbark in the\r\n      street and a knocker wrapped up in buckskin then you stop and\r\n      grind looking as if you meant to stop and grind till doomsday\r\n      presently a window opens and somebody pitches you a sixpence\r\n      with a request to hush up and go on etc i am aware that some\r\n      grinders have actually afforded to go on for this sum but for\r\n      my part i found the necessary outlay of capital too great to\r\n      permit of my going on under a shilling\r\n\r\n      at this occupation i did a good deal but somehow i was not\r\n      quite satisfied and so finally abandoned it the truth is i\r\n      labored under the disadvantage of having no monkeyand american\r\n      streets are so muddy and a democratic rabble is so obstrusive\r\n      and so full of demnition mischievous little boys\r\n\r\n      i was now out of employment for some months but at length\r\n      succeeded by dint of great interest in procuring a situation in\r\n      the shampost the duties here are simple and not altogether\r\n      unprofitable for examplevery early in the morning i had to\r\n      make up my packet of sham letters upon the inside of each of\r\n      these i had to scrawl a few lines on any subject which occurred\r\n      to me as sufficiently mysterioussigning all the epistles tom\r\n      dobson or bobby tompkins or anything in that way having folded\r\n      and sealed all and stamped them with sham postmarksnew orleans\r\n      bengal botany bay or any other place a great way offi set out\r\n      forthwith upon my daily route as if in a very great hurry i\r\n      always called at the big houses to deliver the letters and\r\n      receive the postage nobody hesitates at paying for a\r\n      letterespecially for a double onepeople are such foolsand it\r\n      was no trouble to get round a corner before there was time to\r\n      open the epistles the worst of this profession was that i had\r\n      to walk so much and so fast and so frequently to vary my route\r\n      besides i had serious scruples of conscience i cant bear to\r\n      hear innocent individuals abusedand the way the whole town took\r\n      to cursing tom dobson and bobby tompkins was really awful to\r\n      hear i washed my hands of the matter in disgust\r\n\r\n      my eighth and last speculation has been in the catgrowing way i\r\n      have found that a most pleasant and lucrative business and\r\n      really no trouble at all the country it is well known has\r\n      become infested with catsso much so of late that a petition for\r\n      relief most numerously and respectably signed was brought\r\n      before the legislature at its late memorable session the\r\n      assembly at this epoch was unusually wellinformed and having\r\n      passed many other wise and wholesome enactments it crowned all\r\n      with the catact in its original form this law offered a\r\n      premium for catheads fourpence apiece but the senate\r\n      succeeded in amending the main clause so as to substitute the\r\n      word tails for heads this amendment was so obviously proper\r\n      that the house concurred in it nem con\r\n\r\n      as soon as the governor had signed the bill i invested my whole\r\n      estate in the purchase of toms and tabbies at first i could only\r\n      afford to feed them upon mice which are cheap but they\r\n      fulfilled the scriptural injunction at so marvellous a rate that\r\n      i at length considered it my best policy to be liberal and so\r\n      indulged them in oysters and turtle their tails at a\r\n      legislative price now bring me in a good income for i have\r\n      discovered a way in which by means of macassar oil i can force\r\n      three crops in a year it delights me to find too that the\r\n      animals soon get accustomed to the thing and would rather have\r\n      the appendages cut off than otherwise i consider myself\r\n      therefore a made man and am bargaining for a countryseat on\r\n      the hudson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe landscape garden\r\n\r\n\r\n     the garden like a lady fair was cut\r\n         that lay as if she slumbered in delight\r\n     and to the open skies her eyes did shut\r\n         the azure fields of heaven were sembled right\r\n         in a large round set with flowrs of light\r\n     the flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew\r\n     that hung upon their azure leaves did show\r\n     like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evning blue\r\n                    giles fletcher\r\n\r\n      no more remarkable man ever lived than my friend the young\r\n      ellison he was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion\r\n      of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune from his cradle\r\n      to his grave a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along\r\n      nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere wordly or external\r\n      sense i mean it as synonymous with happiness the person of whom\r\n      i speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild\r\n      doctrines of turgot price priestley and condorcetof\r\n      exemplifying by individual instance what has been deemed the\r\n      mere chimera of the perfectionists in the brief existence of\r\n      ellison i fancy that i have seen refuted the dogmathat in\r\n      mans physical and spiritual nature lies some hidden principle\r\n      the antagonist of bliss an intimate and anxious examination of\r\n      his career has taught me to understand that in general from\r\n      the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the\r\n      wretchedness of mankind that as a species we have in our\r\n      possession the as yet unwrought elements of contentand that\r\n      even now in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on\r\n      the great question of the social condition it is not impossible\r\n      that man the individual under certain unusual and highly\r\n      fortuitous conditions may be happy\r\n\r\n      with opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued and\r\n      thus is it especially worthy of observation that the\r\n      uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great\r\n      part the result of preconcert it is indeed evident that with\r\n      less of the instinctive philosophy which now and then stands so\r\n      well in the stead of experience mr ellison would have found\r\n      himself precipitated by the very extraordinary successes of his\r\n      life into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those\r\n      of preeminent endowments but it is by no means my present object\r\n      to pen an essay on happiness the ideas of my friend may be\r\n      summed up in a few words he admitted but four unvarying laws or\r\n      rather elementary principles of bliss that which he considered\r\n      chief was strange to say the simple and purely physical one\r\n      of free exercise in the open air the health he said\r\n      attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name\r\n      he pointed to the tillers of the earththe only people who as a\r\n      class are proverbially more happy than othersand then he\r\n      instanced the high ecstasies of the foxhunter his second\r\n      principle was the love of woman his third was the contempt of\r\n      ambition his fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit and he\r\n      held that other things being equal the extent of happiness was\r\n      proportioned to the spirituality of this object\r\n\r\n      i have said that ellison was remarkable in the continuous\r\n      profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune in personal\r\n      grace and beauty he exceeded all men his intellect was of that\r\n      order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a\r\n      necessity and an intuition his family was one of the most\r\n      illustrious of the empire his bride was the loveliest and most\r\n      devoted of women his possessions had been always ample but\r\n      upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year it was\r\n      discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had\r\n      been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world\r\n      amid which they occur and seldom fail radically to alter the\r\n      entire moral constitution of those who are their objects it\r\n      appears that about one hundred years prior to mr ellisons\r\n      attainment of his majority there had died in a remote province\r\n      one mr seabright ellison this gentlemen had amassed a princely\r\n      fortune and having no very immediate connexions conceived the\r\n      whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after\r\n      his decease minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes\r\n      of investment he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest\r\n      of blood bearing the name ellison who should be alive at the\r\n      end of the hundred years many futile attempts had been made to\r\n      set aside this singular bequest their ex post facto character\r\n      rendered them abortive but the attention of a jealous government\r\n      was aroused and a decree finally obtained forbidding all\r\n      similar accumulations this act did not prevent young ellison\r\n      upon his twentyfirst birthday from entering into possession\r\n      as the heir of his ancestor seabright of a fortune of four\r\n      hundred and fifty millions of dollars \r\n\r\n      when it had become definitely known that such was the enormous\r\n      wealth inherited there were of course many speculations as to\r\n      the mode of its disposal the gigantic magnitude and the\r\n      immediately available nature of the sum dazzled and bewildered\r\n      all who thought upon the topic the possessor of any appreciable\r\n      amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a\r\n      thousand things with riches merely surpassing those of any\r\n      citizen it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to\r\n      supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time or\r\n      busying himself with political intrigues or aiming at\r\n      ministerial power or purchasing increase of nobility or\r\n      devising gorgeous architectural piles or collecting large\r\n      specimens of virtu or playing the munificent patron of letters\r\n      and art or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive\r\n      institutions of charity but for the inconceivable wealth in the\r\n      actual possession of the young heir these objects and all\r\n      ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate recourse was had to\r\n      figures and figures but sufficed to confound it was seen that\r\n      even at three per cent the annual income of the inheritance\r\n      amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred\r\n      thousand dollars which was one million and one hundred and\r\n      twentyfive thousand per month or thirtysix thousand nine\r\n      hundred and eightysix per day or one thousand five hundred and\r\n      fortyone per hour or six and twenty dollars for every minute\r\n      that flew thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly\r\n      broken up men knew not what to imagine there were some who even\r\n      conceived that mr ellison would divest himself forthwith of at\r\n      least twothirds of his fortune as of utterly superfluous\r\n      opulence enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of\r\n      his superabundance\r\n\r\n      i was not surprised however to perceive that he had long made\r\n      up his mind upon a topic which had occasioned so much of\r\n      discussion to his friends nor was i greatly astonished at the\r\n      nature of his decision in the widest and noblest sense he was a\r\n      poet he comprehended moreover the true character the august\r\n      aims the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment\r\n      the proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt\r\n      to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty some\r\n      peculiarities either in his early education or in the nature of\r\n      his intellect had tinged with what is termed materialism the\r\n      whole cast of his ethical speculations and it was this bias\r\n      perhaps which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most\r\n      advantageous if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise\r\n      of the poetic sentiment was to be found in the creation of novel\r\n      moods of purely physical loveliness thus it happened that he\r\n      became neither musician nor poet if we use this latter term in\r\n      its everyday acceptation or it might have been that he became\r\n      neither the one nor the other in pursuance of an idea of his\r\n      which i have already mentionedthe idea that in the contempt of\r\n      ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on\r\n      earth is it not indeed possible that while a high order of\r\n      genius is necessarily ambitious the highest is invariably above\r\n      that which is termed ambition and may it not thus happen that\r\n      many far greater than milton have contentedly remained mute and\r\n      inglorious i believe the world has never yet seen and that\r\n      unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order\r\n      of mind into distasteful exertion the world will never behold\r\n      that full extent of triumphant execution in the richer\r\n      productions of art of which the human nature is absolutely\r\n      capable\r\n\r\n      mr ellison became neither musician nor poet although no man\r\n      lived more profoundly enamored both of music and the muse under\r\n      other circumstances than those which invested him it is not\r\n      impossible that he would have become a painter the field of\r\n      sculpture although in its nature rigidly poetical was too\r\n      limited in its extent and in its consequences to have occupied\r\n      at any time much of his attention and i have now mentioned all\r\n      the provinces in which even the most liberal understanding of the\r\n      poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of\r\n      expatiating i mean the most liberal public or recognized\r\n      conception of the idea involved in the phrase poetic sentiment\r\n      but mr ellison imagined that the richest and altogether the\r\n      most natural and most suitable province had been blindly\r\n      neglected no definition had spoken of the landscapegardener as\r\n      of the poet yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the\r\n      creation of the landscapegarden offered to the true muse the\r\n      most magnificent of opportunities here was indeed the fairest\r\n      field for the display of invention or imagination in the\r\n      endless combining of forms of novel beauty the elements which\r\n      should enter into combination being at all times and by a vast\r\n      superiority the most glorious which the earth could afford in\r\n      the multiform of the tree and in the multicolor of the flower\r\n      he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of\r\n      nature at physical loveliness and in the direction or\r\n      concentration of this effort or still more properly in its\r\n      adaption to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth he\r\n      perceived that he should be employing the best meanslaboring to\r\n      the greatest advantagein the fulfilment of his destiny as poet\r\n\r\n      its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth\r\n      in his explanation of this phraseology mr ellison did much\r\n      towards solving what has always seemed to me an enigma i mean\r\n      the fact which none but the ignorant dispute that no such\r\n      combinations of scenery exist in nature as the painter of genius\r\n      has in his power to produce no such paradises are to be found in\r\n      reality as have glowed upon the canvass of claude in the most\r\n      enchanting of natural landscapes there will always be found a\r\n      defect or an excessmany excesses and defects while the\r\n      component parts may exceed individually the highest skill of\r\n      the artist the arrangement of the parts will always be\r\n      susceptible of improvement in short no position can be\r\n      attained from which an artistical eye looking steadily will\r\n      not find matter of offence in what is technically termed the\r\n      composition of a natural landscape and yet how unintelligible is\r\n      this in all other matters we are justly instructed to regard\r\n      nature as supreme with her details we shrink from competition\r\n      who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip or to\r\n      improve the proportions of the lily of the valley the criticism\r\n      which says of sculpture or of portraiture that nature is to be\r\n      exalted rather than imitated is in error no pictorial or\r\n      sculptural combinations of points of human loveliness do more\r\n      than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it\r\n      gladdens our daily path byron who often erred erred not in\r\n      saying ive seen more living beauty ripe and real than all the\r\n      nonsense of their stone ideal in landscape alone is the\r\n      principle of the critic true and having felt its truth here it\r\n      is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced\r\n      him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art\r\n      having i say felt its truth here for the feeling is no\r\n      affectation or chimera the mathematics afford no more absolute\r\n      demonstrations than the sentiment of his art yields to the\r\n      artist he not only believes but positively knows that such and\r\n      such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter or form\r\n      constitute and alone constitute the true beauty yet his\r\n      reasons have not yet been matured into expression it remains for\r\n      a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen fully to\r\n      investigate and express them nevertheless is he confirmed in his\r\n      instinctive opinions by the concurrence of all his compeers let\r\n      a composition be defective let an emendation be wrought in its\r\n      mere arrangement of form let this emendation be submitted to\r\n      every artist in the world by each will its necessity be\r\n      admitted and even far more than this in remedy of the defective\r\n      composition each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest\r\n      the identical emendation\r\n\r\n      i repeat that in landscape arrangements or collocations alone\r\n      is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation and that\r\n      therefore her susceptibility of improvement at this one point\r\n      was a mystery which hitherto i had been unable to solve it was\r\n      mr ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as\r\n      improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty was really such\r\n      as respected only the mortal or human point of view that each\r\n      alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly\r\n      effect a blemish in the picture if we could suppose this picture\r\n      viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens it is\r\n      easily understood says mr ellison that what might improve a\r\n      closely scrutinized detail might at the same time injure a\r\n      general and more distantly observed effect he spoke upon this\r\n      topic with warmth regarding not so much its immediate or obvious\r\n      importance which is little as the character of the conclusions\r\n      to which it might lead or of the collateral propositions which\r\n      it might serve to corroborate or sustain there might be a class\r\n      of beings human once but now to humanity invisible for whose\r\n      scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful\r\n      more especially than for our own had been set in order by god\r\n      the great landscapegarden of the whole earth\r\n\r\n      in the course of our discussion my young friend took occasion to\r\n      quote some passages from a writer who has been supposed to have\r\n      well treated this theme\r\n\r\n      there are properly he writes but two styles of\r\n      landscapegardening the natural and the artificial one seeks to\r\n      recall the original beauty of the country by adapting its means\r\n      to the surrounding scenery cultivating trees in harmony with the\r\n      hills or plain of the neighboring land detecting and bringing\r\n      into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color\r\n      which hid from the common observer are revealed everywhere to\r\n      the experienced student of nature the result of the natural\r\n      style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects\r\n      and incongruitiesin the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and\r\n      order than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles\r\n      the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different\r\n      tastes to gratify it has a certain general relation to the\r\n      various styles of building there are the stately avenues and\r\n      retirements of versailles italian terraces and a various mixed\r\n      old english style which bears some relation to the domestic\r\n      gothic or english elizabethan architecture whatever may be said\r\n      against the abuses of the artificial landscapegardening a\r\n      mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty\r\n      this is partly pleasing to the eye by the show of order and\r\n      design and partly moral a terrace with an old mosscovered\r\n      balustrade calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have\r\n      passed there in other days the slightest exhibition of art is an\r\n      evidence of care and human interest\r\n\r\n      from what i have already observed said mr ellison you will\r\n      understand that i reject the idea here expressed of recalling\r\n      the original beauty of the country the original beauty is never\r\n      so great as that which may be introduced of course much depends\r\n      upon the selection of a spot with capabilities what is said in\r\n      respect to the detecting and bringing into practice those nice\r\n      relations of size proportion and color is a mere vagueness of\r\n      speech which may mean much or little or nothing and which\r\n      guides in no degree that the true result of the natural style\r\n      of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and\r\n      incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or\r\n      miracles is a proposition better suited to the grovelling\r\n      apprehension of the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of\r\n      genius the merit suggested is at best negative and appertains\r\n      to that hobbling criticism which in letters would elevate\r\n      addison into apotheosis in truth while that merit which\r\n      consists in the mere avoiding demerit appeals directly to the\r\n      understanding and can thus be foreshadowed in rule the loftier\r\n      merit which breathes and flames in invention or creation can be\r\n      apprehended solely in its results rule applies but to the\r\n      excellences of avoidanceto the virtues which deny or refrain\r\n      beyond these the critical art can but suggest we may be\r\n      instructed to build an odyssey but it is in vain that we are\r\n      told how to conceive a tempest an inferno a prometheus\r\n      bound a nightingale such as that of keats or the sensitive\r\n      plant of shelley but the thing done the wonder accomplished\r\n      and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal the sophists\r\n      of the negative school who through inability to create have\r\n      scoffed at creation are now found the loudest in applause what\r\n      in its chrysalis condition of principle affronted their demure\r\n      reason never fails in its maturity of accomplishment to extort\r\n      admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the\r\n      sublime\r\n\r\n      our authors observations on the artificial style of gardening\r\n      continued mr ellison are less objectionable a mixture of\r\n      pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is\r\n      just and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally\r\n      so i repeat that the principle here expressed is\r\n      incontrovertible but there may be something even beyond it\r\n      there may be an object in full keeping with the principle\r\n      suggestedan object unattainable by the means ordinarily in\r\n      possession of mankind yet which if attained would lend a charm\r\n      to the landscapegarden immeasurably surpassing that which a\r\n      merely human interest could bestow the true poet possessed of\r\n      very unusual pecuniary resources might possibly while retaining\r\n      the necessary idea of art or interest or culture so imbue his\r\n      designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty as to convey\r\n      the sentiment of spiritual interference it will be seen that in\r\n      bringing about such result he secures all the advantages of\r\n      interest or design while relieving his work of all the harshness\r\n      and technicality of art in the most rugged of wildernessesin\r\n      the most savage of the scenes of pure naturethere is apparent\r\n      the art of a creator yet is this art apparent only to\r\n      reflection in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling\r\n      now if we imagine this sense of the almighty design to be\r\n      harmonized in a measurable degree if we suppose a landscape\r\n      whose combined strangeness vastness definitiveness and\r\n      magnificence shall inspire the idea of culture or care or\r\n      superintendence on the part of intelligences superior yet akin\r\n      to humanitythen the sentiment of interest is preserved while\r\n      the art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary\r\n      naturea nature which is not god nor an emanation of god but\r\n      which still is nature in the sense that it is the handiwork of\r\n      the angels that hover between man and god\r\n\r\n      it was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical\r\n      embodiment of a vision such as thisin the free exercise in the\r\n      open air which resulted from personal direction of his plansin\r\n      the continuous and unceasing object which these plans affordedin\r\n      the high spirituality of the object itselfin the contempt of\r\n      ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affectand\r\n      lastly it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted\r\n      wife that ellison thought to find and found an exemption from\r\n      the ordinary cares of humanity with a far greater amount of\r\n      positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt daydreams of de\r\n      staël\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaelzels chessplayer\r\n\r\n\r\n      perhaps no exhibition of the kind has ever elicited so general\r\n      attention as the chessplayer of maelzel wherever seen it has\r\n      been an object of intense curiosity to all persons who think\r\n      yet the question of its modus operandi is still undetermined\r\n      nothing has been written on this topic which can be considered as\r\n      decisiveand accordingly we find every where men of mechanical\r\n      genius of great general acuteness and discriminative\r\n      understanding who make no scruple in pronouncing the automaton a\r\n      pure machine unconnected with human agency in its movements\r\n      and consequently beyond all comparison the most astonishing of\r\n      the inventions of mankind and such it would undoubtedly be were\r\n      they right in their supposition assuming this hypothesis it\r\n      would be grossly absurd to compare with the chessplayer any\r\n      similar thing of either modern or ancient days yet there have\r\n      been many and wonderful automata in brewsters letters on\r\n      natural magic we have an account of the most remarkable among\r\n      these may be mentioned as having beyond doubt existed firstly\r\n      the coach invented by m camus for the amusement of louis xiv\r\n      when a child a table about four feet square was introduced\r\n      into the room appropriated for the exhibition upon this table\r\n      was placed a carriage six inches in length made of wood and\r\n      drawn by two horses of the same material one window being down\r\n      a lady was seen on the back seat a coachman held the reins on\r\n      the box and a footman and page were in their places behind m\r\n      camus now touched a spring whereupon the coachman smacked his\r\n      whip and the horses proceeded in a natural manner along the\r\n      edge of the table drawing after them the carriage having gone\r\n      as far as possible in this direction a sudden turn was made to\r\n      the left and the vehicle was driven at right angles to its\r\n      former course and still closely along the edge of the table in\r\n      this way the coach proceeded until it arrived opposite the chair\r\n      of the young prince it then stopped the page descended and\r\n      opened the door the lady alighted and presented a petition to\r\n      her sovereign she then reentered the page put up the steps\r\n      closed the door and resumed his station the coachman whipped\r\n      his horses and the carriage was driven back to its original\r\n      position\r\n\r\n      the magician of m maillardet is also worthy of notice we copy\r\n      the following account of it from the letters before mentioned\r\n      of dr b who derived his information principally from the\r\n      edinburgh encyclopaedia\r\n\r\n      one of the most popular pieces of mechanism which we have seen\r\n      is the magician constructed by m maillardet for the purpose of\r\n      answering certain given questions a figure dressed like a\r\n      magician appears seated at the bottom of a wall holding a wand\r\n      in one hand and a book in the other a number of questions ready\r\n      prepared are inscribed on oval medallions and the spectator\r\n      takes any of these he chooses and to which he wishes an answer\r\n      and having placed it in a drawer ready to receive it the drawer\r\n      shuts with a spring till the answer is returned the magician\r\n      then arises from his seat bows his head describes circles with\r\n      his wand and consulting the book as if in deep thought he lifts\r\n      it towards his face having thus appeared to ponder over the\r\n      proposed question he raises his wand and striking with it the\r\n      wall above his head two folding doors fly open and display an\r\n      appropriate answer to the question the doors again close the\r\n      magician resumes his original position and the drawer opens to\r\n      return the medallion there are twenty of these medallions all\r\n      containing different questions to which the magician returns the\r\n      most suitable and striking answers the medallions are thin\r\n      plates of brass of an elliptical form exactly resembling each\r\n      other some of the medallions have a question inscribed on each\r\n      side both of which the magician answered in succession if the\r\n      drawer is shut without a medallion being put into it the\r\n      magician rises consults his book shakes his head and resumes\r\n      his seat the folding doors remain shut and the drawer is\r\n      returned empty if two medallions are put into the drawer\r\n      together an answer is returned only to the lower one when the\r\n      machinery is wound up the movements continue about an hour\r\n      during which time about fifty questions may be answered the\r\n      inventor stated that the means by which the different medallions\r\n      acted upon the machinery so as to produce the proper answers to\r\n      the questions which they contained were extremely simple\r\n\r\n      the duck of vaucanson was still more remarkable it was of the\r\n      size of life and so perfect an imitation of the living animal\r\n      that all the spectators were deceived it executed says\r\n      brewster all the natural movements and gestures it ate and\r\n      drank with avidity performed all the quick motions of the head\r\n      and throat which are peculiar to the duck and like it muddled\r\n      the water which it drank with its bill it produced also the\r\n      sound of quacking in the most natural manner in the anatomical\r\n      structure the artist exhibited the highest skill every bone in\r\n      the real duck had its representative in the automaton and its\r\n      wings were anatomically exact every cavity apophysis and\r\n      curvature was imitated and each bone executed its proper\r\n      movements when corn was thrown down before it the duck\r\n      stretched out its neck to pick it up swallowed and digested it\r\n      \r\n\r\n      but if these machines were ingenious what shall we think of the\r\n      calculating machine of mr babbage what shall we think of an\r\n      engine of wood and metal which can not only compute astronomical\r\n      and navigation tables to any given extent but render the\r\n      exactitude of its operations mathematically certain through its\r\n      power of correcting its possible errors what shall we think of a\r\n      machine which can not only accomplish all this but actually\r\n      print off its elaborate results when obtained without the\r\n      slightest intervention of the intellect of man it will perhaps\r\n      be said in reply that a machine such as we have described is\r\n      altogether above comparison with the chessplayer of maelzel by\r\n      no meansit is altogether beneath itthat is to say provided we\r\n      assume what should never for a moment be assumed that the\r\n      chessplayer is a pure machine and performs its operations\r\n      without any immediate human agency arithmetical or algebraical\r\n      calculations are from their very nature fixed and determinate\r\n      certain data being given certain results necessarily and\r\n      inevitably follow these results have dependence upon nothing\r\n      and are influenced by nothing but the data originally given\r\n      and the question to be solved proceeds or should proceed to its\r\n      final determination by a succession of unerring steps liable to\r\n      no change and subject to no modification this being the case\r\n      we can without difficulty conceive the possibility of so\r\n      arranging a piece of mechanism that upon starting in accordance\r\n      with the data of the question to be solved it should continue\r\n      its movements regularly progressively and undeviatingly towards\r\n      the required solution since these movements however complex\r\n      are never imagined to be otherwise than finite and determinate\r\n      but the case is widely different with the chessplayer with him\r\n      there is no determinate progression no one move in chess\r\n      necessarily follows upon any one other from no particular\r\n      disposition of the men at one period of a game can we predicate\r\n      their disposition at a different period let us place the first\r\n      move in a game of chess in juxtaposition with the data of an\r\n      algebraical question and their great difference will be\r\n      immediately perceived from the latterfrom the datathe second\r\n      step of the question dependent thereupon inevitably follows it\r\n      is modelled by the data it must be thus and not otherwise\r\n      but from the first move in the game of chess no especial second\r\n      move follows of necessity in the algebraical question as it\r\n      proceeds towards solution the certainty of its operations\r\n      remains altogether unimpaired the second step having been a\r\n      consequence of the data the third step is equally a\r\n      consequence of the second the fourth of the third the fifth of\r\n      the fourth and so on and not possibly otherwise to the end\r\n      but in proportion to the progress made in a game of chess is the\r\n      uncertainty of each ensuing move a few moves having been made\r\n      no step is certain different spectators of the game would\r\n      advise different moves all is then dependent upon the variable\r\n      judgment of the players now even granting what should not be\r\n      granted that the movements of the automaton chessplayer were in\r\n      themselves determinate they would be necessarily interrupted and\r\n      disarranged by the indeterminate will of his antagonist there is\r\n      then no analogy whatever between the operations of the\r\n      chessplayer and those of the calculating machine of mr\r\n      babbage and if we choose to call the former a pure machine we\r\n      must be prepared to admit that it is beyond all comparison the\r\n      most wonderful of the inventions of mankind its original\r\n      projector however baron kempelen had no scruple in declaring\r\n      it to be a very ordinary piece of mechanisma bagatelle whose\r\n      effects appeared so marvellous only from the boldness of the\r\n      conception and the fortunate choice of the methods adopted for\r\n      promoting the illusion but it is needless to dwell upon this\r\n      point it is quite certain that the operations of the automaton\r\n      are regulated by mind and by nothing else indeed this matter\r\n      is susceptible of a mathematical demonstration a priori the\r\n      only question then is of the manner in which human agency is\r\n      brought to bear before entering upon this subject it would be as\r\n      well to give a brief history and description of the chessplayer\r\n      for the benefit of such of our readers as may never have had an\r\n      opportunity of witnessing mr maelzels exhibition\r\n\r\n      the automaton chessplayer was invented in  by baron\r\n      kempelen a nobleman of presburg in hungary who afterwards\r\n      disposed of it together with the secret of its operations to\r\n      its present possessor  soon after its completion it was\r\n      exhibited in presburg paris vienna and other continental\r\n      cities in  and  it was taken to london by mr maelzel\r\n      of late years it has visited the principal towns in the united\r\n      states wherever seen the most intense curiosity was excited by\r\n      its appearance and numerous have been the attempts by men of\r\n      all classes to fathom the mystery of its evolutions the cut on\r\n      this page gives a tolerable representation of the figure as seen\r\n      by the citizens of richmond a few weeks ago the right arm\r\n      however should lie more at length upon the box a chessboard\r\n      should appear upon it and the cushion should not be seen while\r\n      the pipe is held some immaterial alterations have been made in\r\n      the costume of the player since it came into the possession of\r\n      maelzelthe plume for example was not originally worn image\r\n      of automaton\r\n\r\n      at the hour appointed for exhibition a curtain is withdrawn or\r\n      folding doors are thrown open and the machine rolled to within\r\n      about twelve feet of the nearest of the spectators between whom\r\n      and it the machine a rope is stretched a figure is seen\r\n      habited as a turk and seated with its legs crossed at a large\r\n      box apparently of maple wood which serves it as a table the\r\n      exhibiter will if requested roll the machine to any portion of\r\n      the room suffer it to remain altogether on any designated spot\r\n      or even shift its location repeatedly during the progress of a\r\n      game the bottom of the box is elevated considerably above the\r\n      floor by means of the castors or brazen rollers on which it\r\n      moves a clear view of the surface immediately beneath the\r\n      automaton being thus afforded to the spectators the chair on\r\n      which the figure sits is affixed permanently to the box on the\r\n      top of this latter is a chessboard also permanently affixed\r\n      the right arm of the chessplayer is extended at full length\r\n      before him at right angles with his body and lying in an\r\n      apparently careless position by the side of the board the back\r\n      of the hand is upwards the board itself is eighteen inches\r\n      square the left arm of the figure is bent at the elbow and in\r\n      the left hand is a pipe a green drapery conceals the back of the\r\n      turk and falls partially over the front of both shoulders to\r\n      judge from the external appearance of the box it is divided into\r\n      five compartmentsthree cupboards of equal dimensions and two\r\n      drawers occupying that portion of the chest lying beneath the\r\n      cupboards the foregoing observations apply to the appearance of\r\n      the automaton upon its first introduction into the presence of\r\n      the spectators\r\n\r\n      maelzel now informs the company that he will disclose to their\r\n      view the mechanism of the machine taking from his pocket a bunch\r\n      of keys he unlocks with one of them door marked ~ in the cut\r\n      above and throws the cupboard fully open to the inspection of\r\n      all present its whole interior is apparently filled with wheels\r\n      pinions levers and other machinery crowded very closely\r\n      together so that the eye can penetrate but a little distance\r\n      into the mass leaving this door open to its full extent he goes\r\n      now round to the back of the box and raising the drapery of the\r\n      figure opens another door situated precisely in the rear of the\r\n      one first opened holding a lighted candle at this door and\r\n      shifting the position of the whole machine repeatedly at the same\r\n      time a bright light is thrown entirely through the cupboard\r\n      which is now clearly seen to be full completely full of\r\n      machinery the spectators being satisfied of this fact maelzel\r\n      closes the back door locks it takes the key from the lock lets\r\n      fall the drapery of the figure and comes round to the front the\r\n      door marked i it will be remembered is still open the\r\n      exhibiter now proceeds to open the drawer which lies beneath the\r\n      cupboards at the bottom of the boxfor although there are\r\n      apparently two drawers there is really only onethe two handles\r\n      and two key holes being intended merely for ornament having\r\n      opened this drawer to its full extent a small cushion and a set\r\n      of chessmen fixed in a frame work made to support them\r\n      perpendicularly are discovered leaving this drawer as well as\r\n      cupboard no  open maelzel now unlocks door no  and door no\r\n       which are discovered to be folding doors opening into one and\r\n      the same compartment to the right of this compartment however\r\n      that is to say the spectators right a small division six\r\n      inches wide and filled with machinery is partitioned off the\r\n      main compartment itself in speaking of that portion of the box\r\n      visible upon opening doors  and  we shall always call it the\r\n      main compartment is lined with dark cloth and contains no\r\n      machinery whatever beyond two pieces of steel quadrantshaped\r\n      and situated one in each of the rear top corners of the\r\n      compartment a small protuberance about eight inches square and\r\n      also covered with dark cloth lies on the floor of the\r\n      compartment near the rear corner on the spectators left hand\r\n      leaving doors no  and no  open as well as the drawer and\r\n      door no i the exhibiter now goes round to the back of the main\r\n      compartment and unlocking another door there displays clearly\r\n      all the interior of the main compartment by introducing a candle\r\n      behind it and within it the whole box being thus apparently\r\n      disclosed to the scrutiny of the company maelzel still leaving\r\n      the doors and drawer open rolls the automaton entirely round\r\n      and exposes the back of the turk by lifting up the drapery a\r\n      door about ten inches square is thrown open in the loins of the\r\n      figure and a smaller one also in the left thigh the interior of\r\n      the figure as seen through these apertures appears to be\r\n      crowded with machinery in general every spectator is now\r\n      thoroughly satisfied of having beheld and completely scrutinized\r\n      at one and the same time every individual portion of the\r\n      automaton and the idea of any person being concealed in the\r\n      interior during so complete an exhibition of that interior if\r\n      ever entertained is immediately dismissed as preposterous in the\r\n      extreme\r\n\r\n      m maelzel having rolled the machine back into its original\r\n      position now informs the company that the automaton will play a\r\n      game of chess with any one disposed to encounter him this\r\n      challenge being accepted a small table is prepared for the\r\n      antagonist and placed close by the rope but on the spectators\r\n      side of it and so situated as not to prevent the company from\r\n      obtaining a full view of the automaton from a drawer in this\r\n      table is taken a set of chessmen and maelzel arranges them\r\n      generally but not always with his own hands on the chess\r\n      board which consists merely of the usual number of squares\r\n      painted upon the table the antagonist having taken his seat the\r\n      exhibiter approaches the drawer of the box and takes therefrom\r\n      the cushion which after removing the pipe from the hand of the\r\n      automaton he places under its left arm as a support then taking\r\n      also from the drawer the automatons set of chessmen he\r\n      arranges them upon the chessboard before the figure he now\r\n      proceeds to close the doors and to lock themleaving the bunch of\r\n      keys in door no  he also closes the drawer and finally\r\n      winds up the machine by applying a key to an aperture in the\r\n      left end the spectators left of the box the game now\r\n      commencesthe automaton taking the first move the duration of\r\n      the contest is usually limited to half an hour but if it be not\r\n      finished at the expiration of this period and the antagonist\r\n      still contend that he can beat the automaton m maelzel has\r\n      seldom any objection to continue it not to weary the company is\r\n      the ostensible and no doubt the real object of the limitation\r\n      it wits of course be understood that when a move is made at his\r\n      own table by the antagonist the corresponding move is made at\r\n      the box of the automaton by maelzel himself who then acts as\r\n      the representative of the antagonist on the other hand when the\r\n      turk moves the corresponding move is made at the table of the\r\n      antagonist also by m maelzel who then acts as the\r\n      representative of the automaton in this manner it is necessary\r\n      that the exhibiter should often pass from one table to the other\r\n      he also frequently goes in rear of the figure to remove the\r\n      chessmen which it has taken and which it deposits when taken\r\n      on the box to the left to its own left of the board when the\r\n      automaton hesitates in relation to its move the exhibiter is\r\n      occasionally seen to place himself very near its right side and\r\n      to lay his hand now and then in a careless manner upon the box\r\n      he has also a peculiar shuffle with his feet calculated to\r\n      induce suspicion of collusion with the machine in minds which are\r\n      more cunning than sagacious these peculiarities are no doubt\r\n      mere mannerisms of m maelzel or if he is aware of them at all\r\n      he puts them in practice with a view of exciting in the\r\n      spectators a false idea of the pure mechanism in the automaton\r\n\r\n      the turk plays with his left hand all the movements of the arm\r\n      are at right angles in this manner the hand which is gloved\r\n      and bent in a natural way being brought directly above the\r\n      piece to be moved descends finally upon it the fingers\r\n      receiving it in most cases without difficulty occasionally\r\n      however when the piece is not precisely in its proper situation\r\n      the automaton fails in his attempt at seizing it when this\r\n      occurs no second effort is made but the arm continues its\r\n      movement in the direction originally intended precisely as if\r\n      the piece were in the fingers having thus designated the spot\r\n      whither the move should have been made the arm returns to its\r\n      cushion and maelzel performs the evolution which the automaton\r\n      pointed out at every movement of the figure machinery is heard\r\n      in motion during the progress of the game the figure now and\r\n      then rolls its eyes as if surveying the board moves its head\r\n      and pronounces the word echec check when necessary  if a\r\n      false move be made by his antagonist he raps briskly on the box\r\n      with the fingers of his right hand shakes his head roughly and\r\n      replacing the piece falsely moved in its former situation\r\n      assumes the next move himself upon beating the game he waves\r\n      his head with an air of triumph looks round complacently upon\r\n      the spectators and drawing his left arm farther back than usual\r\n      suffers his fingers alone to rest upon the cushion in general\r\n      the turk is victoriousonce or twice he has been beaten the game\r\n      being ended maelzel will again if desired exhibit the mechanism\r\n      of the box in the same manner as before the machine is then\r\n      rolled back and a curtain hides it from the view of the company\r\n\r\n      there have been many attempts at solving the mystery of the\r\n      automaton the most general opinion in relation to it an opinion\r\n      too not unfrequently adopted by men who should have known better\r\n      was as we have before said that no immediate human agency was\r\n      employedin other words that the machine was purely a machine\r\n      and nothing else many however maintained that the exhibiter\r\n      himself regulated the movements of the figure by mechanical means\r\n      operating through the feet of the box others again spoke\r\n      confidently of a magnet of the first of these opinions we shall\r\n      say nothing at present more than we have already said in\r\n      relation to the second it is only necessary to repeat what we\r\n      have before stated that the machine is rolled about on castors\r\n      and will at the request of a spectator be moved to and fro to\r\n      any portion of the room even during the progress of a game the\r\n      supposition of the magnet is also untenablefor if a magnet were\r\n      the agent any other magnet in the pocket of a spectator would\r\n      disarrange the entire mechanism the exhibiter however will\r\n      suffer the most powerful loadstone to remain even upon the box\r\n      during the whole of the exhibition\r\n\r\n      the first attempt at a written explanation of the secret at\r\n      least the first attempt of which we ourselves have any knowledge\r\n      was made in a large pamphlet printed at paris in  the\r\n      authors hypothesis amounted to thisthat a dwarf actuated the\r\n      machine this dwarf he supposed to conceal himself during the\r\n      opening of the box by thrusting his legs into two hollow\r\n      cylinders which were represented to be but which are not among\r\n      the machinery in the cupboard no i while his body was out of\r\n      the box entirely and covered by the drapery of the turk when\r\n      the doors were shut the dwarf was enabled to bring his body\r\n      within the boxthe noise produced by some portion of the\r\n      machinery allowing him to do so unheard and also to close the\r\n      door by which he entered the interior of the automaton being\r\n      then exhibited and no person discovered the spectators says\r\n      the author of this pamphlet are satisfied that no one is within\r\n      any portion of the machine this whole hypothesis was too\r\n      obviously absurd to require comment or refutation and\r\n      accordingly we find that it attracted very little attention\r\n\r\n      in  a book was published at dresden by m i f freyhere in\r\n      which another endeavor was made to unravel the mystery mr\r\n      freyheres book was a pretty large one and copiously illustrated\r\n      by colored engravings his supposition was that a welltaught\r\n      boy very thin and tall of his age sufficiently so that he could\r\n      be concealed in a drawer almost immediately under the\r\n      chessboard played the game of chess and effected all the\r\n      evolutions of the automaton this idea although even more silly\r\n      than that of the parisian author met with a better reception\r\n      and was in some measure believed to be the true solution of the\r\n      wonder until the inventor put an end to the discussion by\r\n      suffering a close examination of the top of the box\r\n\r\n      these bizarre attempts at explanation were followed by others\r\n      equally bizarre of late years however an anonymous writer by a\r\n      course of reasoning exceedingly unphilosophical has contrived to\r\n      blunder upon a plausible solutionalthough we cannot consider it\r\n      altogether the true one his essay was first published in a\r\n      baltimore weekly paper was illustrated by cuts and was entitled\r\n      an attempt to analyze the automaton chessplayer of m maelzel\r\n      this essay we suppose to have been the original of the pamphlet\r\n      to which sir david brewster alludes in his letters on natural\r\n      magic and which he has no hesitation in declaring a thorough and\r\n      satisfactory explanation the results of the analysis are\r\n      undoubtedly in the main just but we can only account for\r\n      brewsters pronouncing the essay a thorough and satisfactory\r\n      explanation by supposing him to have bestowed upon it a very\r\n      cursory and inattentive perusal in the compendium of the essay\r\n      made use of in the letters on natural magic it is quite\r\n      impossible to arrive at any distinct conclusion in regard to the\r\n      adequacy or inadequacy of the analysis on account of the gross\r\n      misarrangement and deficiency of the letters of reference\r\n      employed the same fault is to be found in the attempt c as\r\n      we originally saw it the solution consists in a series of minute\r\n      explanations accompanied by woodcuts the whole occupying many\r\n      pages in which the object is to show the possibility of so\r\n      shifting the partitions of the box as to allow a human being\r\n      concealed in the interior to move portions of his body from one\r\n      part of the box to another during the exhibition of the\r\n      mechanismthus eluding the scrutiny of the spectators there can\r\n      be no doubt as we have before observed and as we will presently\r\n      endeavor to show that the principle or rather the result of\r\n      this solution is the true one some person is concealed in the\r\n      box during the whole time of exhibiting the interior we object\r\n      however to the whole verbose description of the manner in\r\n      which the partitions are shifted to accommodate the movements of\r\n      the person concealed we object to it as a mere theory assumed in\r\n      the first place and to which circumstances are afterwards made\r\n      to adapt themselves it was not and could not have been arrived\r\n      at by any inductive reasoning in whatever way the shifting is\r\n      managed it is of course concealed at every step from\r\n      observation to show that certain movements might possibly be\r\n      effected in a certain way is very far from showing that they are\r\n      actually so effected there may be an infinity of other methods\r\n      by which the same results may be obtained the probability of the\r\n      one assumed proving the correct one is then as unity to infinity\r\n      but in reality this particular point the shifting of the\r\n      partitions is of no consequence whatever it was altogether\r\n      unnecessary to devote seven or eight pages for the purpose of\r\n      proving what no one in his senses would denyviz that the\r\n      wonderful mechanical genius of baron kempelen could invent the\r\n      necessary means for shutting a door or slipping aside a pannel\r\n      with a human agent too at his service in actual contact with the\r\n      pannel or the door and the whole operations carried on as the\r\n      author of the essay himself shows and as we shall attempt to\r\n      show more fully hereafter entirely out of reach of the\r\n      observation of the spectators\r\n\r\n      in attempting ourselves an explanation of the automaton we will\r\n      in the first place endeavor to show how its operations are\r\n      effected and afterwards describe as briefly as possible the\r\n      nature of the observations from which we have deduced our\r\n      result\r\n\r\n      it will be necessary for a proper understanding of the subject\r\n      that we repeat here in a few words the routine adopted by the\r\n      exhibiter in disclosing the interior of the boxa routine from\r\n      which he never deviates in any material particular in the\r\n      first place he opens the door no i leaving this open he goes\r\n      round to the rear of the box and opens a door precisely at the\r\n      back of door no i to this back door he holds a lighted candle\r\n      he then closes the back door locks it and coming round to\r\n      the front opens the drawer to its full extent this done he\r\n      opens the doors no  and no  the folding doors and displays\r\n      the interior of the main compartment leaving open the main\r\n      compartment the drawer and the front door of cupboard no i he\r\n      now goes to the rear again and throws open the back door of the\r\n      main compartment in shutting up the box no particular order is\r\n      observed except that the folding doors are always closed before\r\n      the drawer\r\n\r\n      now let us suppose that when the machine is first rolled into\r\n      the presence of the spectators a man is already within it his\r\n      body is situated behind the dense machinery in cupboard no t\r\n      the rear portion of which machinery is so contrived as to slip\r\n      en masse from the main compartment to the cupboard no i as\r\n      occasion may require and his legs lie at full length in the\r\n      main compartment when maelzel opens the door no i the man\r\n      within is not in any danger of discovery for the keenest eye\r\n      cannot penetrate more than about two inches into the darkness\r\n      within but the case is otherwise when the back door of the\r\n      cupboard no i is opened a bright light then pervades the\r\n      cupboard and the body of the man would be discovered if it were\r\n      there but it is not the putting the key in the lock of the back\r\n      door was a signal on hearing which the person concealed brought\r\n      his body forward to an angle as acute as possiblethrowing it\r\n      altogether or nearly so into the main compartment this\r\n      however is a painful position and cannot be long maintained\r\n      accordingly we find that maelzel closes the back door this\r\n      being done there is no reason why the body of the man may not\r\n      resume its former situationfor the cupboard is again so dark as\r\n      to defy scrutiny the drawer is now opened and the legs of the\r\n      person within drop down behind it in the space it formerly\r\n      occupied  there is consequently now no longer any part of\r\n      the man in the main compartmenthis body being behind the\r\n      machinery in cupboard no  and his legs in the space occupied\r\n      by the drawer the exhibiter therefore finds himself at liberty\r\n      to display the main compartment this he doesopening both its\r\n      back and front doorsand no person is discovered the spectators\r\n      are now satisfied that the whole of the box is exposed to\r\n      viewand exposed too all portions of it at one and the same\r\n      time but of course this is not the case they neither see the\r\n      space behind the drawer nor the interior of cupboard no the\r\n      front door of which latter the exhibiter virtually shuts in\r\n      shutting its back door maelzel having now rolled the machine\r\n      around lifted up the drapery of the turk opened the doors in\r\n      his back and thigh and shown his trunk to be full of machinery\r\n      brings the whole back into its original position and closes the\r\n      doors the man within is now at liberty to move about he gets up\r\n      into the body of the turk just so high as to bring his eyes above\r\n      the level of the chessboard it is very probable that he seats\r\n      himself upon the little square block or protuberance which is\r\n      seen in a corner of the main compartment when the doors are open\r\n      in this position he sees the chessboard through the bosom of the\r\n      turk which is of gauze bringing his right arm across his breast\r\n      he actuates the little machinery necessary to guide the left arm\r\n      and the fingers of the figure this machinery is situated just\r\n      beneath the left shoulder of the turk and is consequently easily\r\n      reached by the right hand of the man concealed if we suppose his\r\n      right arm brought across the breast the motions of the head and\r\n      eyes and of the right arm of the figure as well as the sound\r\n      echec are produced by other mechanism in the interior and\r\n      actuated at will by the man within the whole of this\r\n      mechanismthat is to say all the mechanism essential to the\r\n      machineis most probably contained within the little cupboard of\r\n      about six inches in breadth partitioned off at the right the\r\n      spectators right of the main compartment\r\n\r\n      in this analysis of the operations of the automaton we have\r\n      purposely avoided any allusion to the manner in which the\r\n      partitions are shifted and it will now be readily comprehended\r\n      that this point is a matter of no importance since by mechanism\r\n      within the ability of any common carpenter it might be effected\r\n      in an infinity of different ways and since we have shown that\r\n      however performed it is performed out of the view of the\r\n      spectators our result is founded upon the following\r\n      observations taken during frequent visits to the exhibition of\r\n      maelzel \r\n\r\n      i the moves of the turk are not made at regular intervals of\r\n      time but accommodate themselves to the moves of the\r\n      antagonistalthough this point of regularity so important in\r\n      all kinds of mechanical contrivance might have been readily\r\n      brought about by limiting the time allowed for the moves of the\r\n      antagonist for example if this limit were three minutes the\r\n      moves of the automaton might be made at any given intervals\r\n      longer than three minutes the fact then of irregularity when\r\n      regularity might have been so easily attained goes to prove that\r\n      regularity is unimportant to the action of the automatonin other\r\n      words that the automaton is not a pure machine\r\n\r\n       when the automaton is about to move a piece a distinct motion\r\n      is observable just beneath the left shoulder and which motion\r\n      agitates in a slight degree the drapery covering the front of\r\n      the left shoulder this motion invariably precedes by about two\r\n      seconds the movement of the arm itselfand the arm never in any\r\n      instance moves without this preparatory motion in the shoulder\r\n      now let the antagonist move a piece and let the corresponding\r\n      move be made by maelzel as usual upon the board of the\r\n      automaton then let the antagonist narrowly watch the automaton\r\n      until he detect the preparatory motion in the shoulder\r\n      immediately upon detecting this motion and before the arm itself\r\n      begins to move let him withdraw his piece as if perceiving an\r\n      error in his manœuvre it will then be seen that the movement of\r\n      the arm which in all other cases immediately succeeds the\r\n      motion in the shoulder is withheldis not madealthough maelzel\r\n      has not yet performed on the board of the automaton any move\r\n      corresponding to the withdrawal of the antagonist in this case\r\n      that the automaton was about to move is evidentand that he did\r\n      not move was an effect plainly produced by the withdrawal of the\r\n      antagonist and without any intervention of maelzel\r\n\r\n      this fact fully proves that the intervention of maelzel in\r\n      performing the moves of the antagonist on the board of the\r\n      automaton is not essential to the movements of the automaton\r\n      that its movements are regulated by mindby some person who\r\n      sees the board of the antagonist that its movements are not\r\n      regulated by the mind of maelzel whose back was turned towards\r\n      the antagonist at the withdrawal of his move\r\n\r\n       the automaton does not invariably win the game were the\r\n      machine a pure machine this would not be the caseit would always\r\n      win the principle being discovered by which a machine can be\r\n      made to play a game of chess an extension of the same\r\n      principle would enable it to win a gamea farther extension would\r\n      enable it to win all gamesthat is to beat any possible game\r\n      of an antagonist a little consideration will convince any one\r\n      that the difficulty of making a machine beat all games is not in\r\n      the least degree greater as regards the principle of the\r\n      operations necessary than that of making it beat a single game\r\n      if then we regard the chessplayer as a machine we must suppose\r\n      what is highly improbable that its inventor preferred leaving\r\n      it incomplete to perfecting ita supposition rendered still more\r\n      absurd when we reflect that the leaving it incomplete would\r\n      afford an argument against the possibility of its being a pure\r\n      machinethe very argument we now adduce\r\n\r\n       when the situation of the game is difficult or complex we\r\n      never perceive the turk either shake his head or roll his eyes\r\n      it is only when his next move is obvious or when the game is so\r\n      circumstanced that to a man in the automatons place there would\r\n      be no necessity for reflection now these peculiar movements of\r\n      the head and eyes are movements customary with persons engaged in\r\n      meditation and the ingenious baron kempelen would have adapted\r\n      these movements were the machine a pure machine to occasions\r\n      proper for their displaythat is to occasions of complexity but\r\n      the reverse is seen to be the case and this reverse applies\r\n      precisely to our supposition of a man in the interior when\r\n      engaged in meditation about the game he has no time to think of\r\n      setting in motion the mechanism of the automaton by which are\r\n      moved the head and the eyes when the game however is obvious\r\n      he has time to look about him and accordingly we see the head\r\n      shake and the eyes roll\r\n\r\n       when the machine is rolled round to allow the spectators an\r\n      examination of the back of the turk and when his drapery is\r\n      lifted up and the doors in the trunk and thigh thrown open the\r\n      interior of the trunk is seen to be crowded with machinery in\r\n      scrutinizing this machinery while the automaton was in motion\r\n      that is to say while the whole machine was moving on the castors\r\n      it appeared to us that certain portions of the mechanism changed\r\n      their shape and position in a degree too great to be accounted\r\n      for by the simple laws of perspective and subsequent\r\n      examinations convinced us that these undue alterations were\r\n      attributable to mirrors in the interior of the trunk the\r\n      introduction of mirrors among the machinery could not have been\r\n      intended to influence in any degree the machinery itself their\r\n      operation whatever that operation should prove to be must\r\n      necessarily have reference to the eye of the spectator we at\r\n      once concluded that these mirrors were so placed to multiply to\r\n      the vision some few pieces of machinery within the trunk so as to\r\n      give it the appearance of being crowded with mechanism now the\r\n      direct inference from this is that the machine is not a pure\r\n      machine for if it were the inventor so far from wishing its\r\n      mechanism to appear complex and using deception for the purpose\r\n      of giving it this appearance would have been especially desirous\r\n      of convincing those who witnessed his exhibition of the\r\n      simplicity of the means by which results so wonderful were\r\n      brought about\r\n\r\n       the external appearance and especially the deportment of\r\n      the turk are when we consider them as imitations of life but\r\n      very indifferent imitations the countenance evinces no\r\n      ingenuity and is surpassed in its resemblance to the human\r\n      face by the very commonest of waxworks the eyes roll\r\n      unnaturally in the head without any corresponding motions of the\r\n      lids or brows the arm particularly performs its operations in\r\n      an exceedingly stiff awkward jerking and rectangular manner\r\n      now all this is the result either of inability in maelzel to do\r\n      better or of intentional neglectaccidental neglect being out of\r\n      the question when we consider that the whole time of the\r\n      ingenious proprietor is occupied in the improvement of his\r\n      machines most assuredly we must not refer the unlifelike\r\n      appearances to inabilityfor all the rest of maelzels automata\r\n      are evidence of his full ability to copy the motions and\r\n      peculiarities of life with the most wonderful exactitude the\r\n      ropedancers for example are inimitable when the clown laughs\r\n      his lips his eyes his eyebrows and eyelidsindeed all the\r\n      features of his countenanceare imbued with their appropriate\r\n      expressions in both him and his companion every gesture is so\r\n      entirely easy and free from the semblance of artificiality\r\n      that were it not for the diminutiveness of their size and the\r\n      fact of their being passed from one spectator to another previous\r\n      to their exhibition on the rope it would be difficult to\r\n      convince any assemblage of persons that these wooden automata\r\n      were not living creatures we cannot therefore doubt mr\r\n      maelzels ability and we must necessarily suppose that he\r\n      intentionally suffered his chess player to remain the same\r\n      artificial and unnatural figure which baron kempelen no doubt\r\n      also through design originally made it what this design was it\r\n      is not difficult to conceive were the automaton lifelike in its\r\n      motions the spectator would be more apt to attribute its\r\n      operations to their true cause that is to human agency within\r\n      than he is now when the awkward and rectangular manœuvres convey\r\n      the idea of pure and unaided mechanism\r\n\r\n       when a short time previous to the commencement of the game\r\n      the automaton is wound up by the exhibiter as usual an ear in\r\n      any degree accustomed to the sounds produced in winding up a\r\n      system of machinery will not fail to discover instantaneously\r\n      that the axis turned by the key in the box of the chessplayer\r\n      cannot possibly be connected with either a weight a spring or\r\n      any system of machinery whatever the inference here is the same\r\n      as in our last observation the winding up is inessential to the\r\n      operations of the automaton and is performed with the design of\r\n      exciting in the spectators the false idea of mechanism\r\n\r\n       when the question is demanded explicitly of maelzelis the\r\n      automaton a pure machine or not his reply is invariably the\r\n      samei will say nothing about it now the notoriety of the\r\n      automaton and the great curiosity it has every where excited\r\n      are owing more especially to the prevalent opinion that it is a\r\n      pure machine than to any other circumstance of course then it\r\n      is the interest of the proprietor to represent it as a pure\r\n      machine and what more obvious and more effectual method could\r\n      there be of impressing the spectators with this desired idea\r\n      than a positive and explicit declaration to that effect on the\r\n      other hand what more obvious and effectual method could there be\r\n      of exciting a disbelief in the automatons being a pure machine\r\n      than by withholding such explicit declaration for people will\r\n      naturally reason thusit is maelzels interest to represent this\r\n      thing a pure machinehe refuses to do so directly in words\r\n      although he does not scruple and is evidently anxious to do so\r\n      indirectly by actionswere it actually what he wishes to\r\n      represent it by actions he would gladly avail himself of the\r\n      more direct testimony of wordsthe inference is that a\r\n      consciousness of its not being a pure machine is the reason of\r\n      his silencehis actions cannot implicate him in a falsehoodhis\r\n      words may\r\n\r\n       when in exhibiting the interior of the box maelzel has\r\n      thrown open the door no i and also the door immediately behind\r\n      it he holds a lighted candle at the back door as mentioned\r\n      above and moves the entire machine to and fro with a view of\r\n      convincing the company that the cupboard no  is entirely filled\r\n      with machinery when the machine is thus moved about it will be\r\n      apparent to any careful observer that whereas that portion of\r\n      the machinery near the front door no  is perfectly steady and\r\n      unwavering the portion farther within fluctuates in a very\r\n      slight degree with the movements of the machine this\r\n      circumstance first aroused in us the suspicion that the more\r\n      remote portion of the machinery was so arranged as to be easily\r\n      slipped en masse from its position when occasion should\r\n      require it this occasion we have already stated to occur when\r\n      the man concealed within brings his body into an erect position\r\n      upon the closing of the back door\r\n\r\n       sir david brewster states the figure of the turk to be of the\r\n      size of lifebut in fact it is far above the ordinary size\r\n      nothing is more easy than to err in our notions of magnitude the\r\n      body of the automaton is generally insulated and having no\r\n      means of immediately comparing it with any human form we suffer\r\n      ourselves to consider it as of ordinary dimensions this mistake\r\n      may however be corrected by observing the chessplayer when as\r\n      is sometimes the case the exhibiter approaches it mr maelzel\r\n      to be sure is not very tall but upon drawing near the machine\r\n      his head will be found at least eighteen inches below the head of\r\n      the turk although the latter it will be remembered is in a\r\n      sitting position\r\n\r\n       the box behind which the automaton is placed is precisely\r\n      three feet six inches long two feet four inches deep and two\r\n      feet six inches high these dimensions are fully sufficient for\r\n      the accommodation of a man very much above the common sizeand\r\n      the main compartment alone is capable of holding any ordinary man\r\n      in the position we have mentioned as assumed by the person\r\n      concealed as these are facts which any one who doubts them may\r\n      prove by actual calculation we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon\r\n      them we will only suggest that although the top of the box is\r\n      apparently a board of about three inches in thickness the\r\n      spectator may satisfy himself by stooping and looking up at it\r\n      when the main compartment is open that it is in reality very\r\n      thin the height of the drawer also will be misconceived by those\r\n      who examine it in a cursory manner there is a space of about\r\n      three inches between the top of the drawer as seen from the\r\n      exterior and the bottom of the cupboarda space which must be\r\n      included in the height of the drawer these contrivances to make\r\n      the room within the box appear less than it actually is are\r\n      referrible to a design on the part of the inventor to impress\r\n      the company again with a false idea viz that no human being can\r\n      be accommodated within the box\r\n\r\n       the interior of the main compartment is lined throughout with\r\n      cloth this cloth we suppose to have a twofold object a\r\n      portion of it may form when tightly stretched the only\r\n      partitions which there is any necessity for removing during the\r\n      changes of the mans position viz the partition between the\r\n      rear of the main compartment and the rear of the cupboard no \r\n      and the partition between the main compartment and the space\r\n      behind the drawer when open if we imagine this to be the case\r\n      the difficulty of shifting the partitions vanishes at once if\r\n      indeed any such difficulty could be supposed under any\r\n      circumstances to exist the second object of the cloth is to\r\n      deaden and render indistinct all sounds occasioned by the\r\n      movements of the person within\r\n\r\n       the antagonist as we have before observed is not suffered\r\n      to play at the board of the automaton but is seated at some\r\n      distance from the machine the reason which most probably would\r\n      be assigned for this circumstance if the question were demanded\r\n      is that were the antagonist otherwise situated his person would\r\n      intervene between the machine and the spectators and preclude\r\n      the latter from a distinct view but this difficulty might be\r\n      easily obviated either by elevating the seats of the company or\r\n      by turning the end of the box towards them during the game the\r\n      true cause of the restriction is perhaps very different were\r\n      the antagonist seated in contact with the box the secret would\r\n      be liable to discovery by his detecting with the aid of a quick\r\n      car the breathings of the man concealed\r\n\r\n       although m maelzel in disclosing the interior of the\r\n      machine sometimes slightly deviates from the routine which we\r\n      have pointed out yet reeler in any instance does he so\r\n      deviate from it as to interfere with our solution for example\r\n      he has been known to open first of all the drawerbut he never\r\n      opens the main compartment without first closing the back door of\r\n      cupboard no he never opens the main compartment without first\r\n      pulling out the drawerhe never shuts the drawer without first\r\n      shutting the main compartmenthe never opens the back door of\r\n      cupboard no  while the main compartment is openand the game of\r\n      chess is never commenced until the whole machine is closed now\r\n      if it were observed that never in any single instance did m\r\n      maelzel differ from the routine we have pointed out as necessary\r\n      to our solution it would be one of the strongest possible\r\n      arguments in corroboration of itbut the argument becomes\r\n      infinitely strengthened if we duly consider the circumstance that\r\n      he does occasionally deviate from the routine but never does\r\n      so deviate as to falsify the solution\r\n\r\n       there are six candles on the board of the automaton during\r\n      exhibition the question naturally ariseswhy are so many\r\n      employed when a single candle or at farthest two would have\r\n      been amply sufficient to afford the spectators a clear view of\r\n      the board in a room otherwise so well lit up as the exhibition\r\n      room always iswhen moreover if we suppose the machine a pure\r\n      machine there can be no necessity for so much light or indeed\r\n      any light at all to enable it to perform its operationsand\r\n      when especially only a single candle is placed upon the table\r\n      of the antagonist the first and most obvious inference is that\r\n      so strong a light is requisite to enable the man within to see\r\n      through the transparent material probably fine gauze of which\r\n      the breast of the turk is composed but when we consider the\r\n      arrangement of the candles another reason immediately presents\r\n      itself there are six lights as we have said before in all\r\n      three of these are on each side of the figure those most remote\r\n      from the spectators are the longestthose in the middle are about\r\n      two inches shorterand those nearest the company about two inches\r\n      shorter stilland the candles on one side differ in height from\r\n      the candles respectively opposite on the other by a ratio\r\n      different from two inchesthat is to say the longest candle on\r\n      one side is about three inches shorter than the longest candle on\r\n      the other and so on thus it will be seen that no two of the\r\n      candles are of the same height and thus also the difficulty of\r\n      ascertaining the material of the breast of the figure against\r\n      which the light is especially directed is greatly augmented by\r\n      the dazzling effect of the complicated crossings of the\r\n      rayscrossings which are brought about by placing the centres of\r\n      radiation all upon different levels\r\n\r\n       while the chessplayer was in possession of baron kempelen\r\n      it was more than once observed first that an italian in the\r\n      suite of the baron was never visible during the playing of a game\r\n      at chess by the turk and secondly that the italian being taken\r\n      seriously ill the exhibition was suspended until his recovery\r\n      this italian professed a total ignorance of the game of chess\r\n      although all others of the suite played well similar\r\n      observations have been made since the automaton has been\r\n      purchased by maelzel there is a man schlumberoer who attends\r\n      him wherever he goes but who has no ostensible occupation other\r\n      than that of assisting in the packing and unpacking of the\r\n      automata this man is about the medium size and has a remarkable\r\n      stoop in the shoulders whether he professes to play chess or\r\n      not we are not informed it is quite certain however that he\r\n      is never to be seen during the exhibition of the chessplayer\r\n      although frequently visible just before and just after the\r\n      exhibition moreover some years ago maelzel visited richmond\r\n      with his automata and exhibited them we believe in the house\r\n      now occupied by m bossieux as a dancing academy schlumberger\r\n      was suddenly taken ill and during his illness there was no\r\n      exhibition of the chessplayer these facts are well known to\r\n      many of our citizens the reason assigned for the suspension of\r\n      the chessplayers performances was not the illness of\r\n      schlumberger the inferences from all this we leave without\r\n      farther comment to the reader\r\n\r\n       the turk plays with his left arm a circumstance so\r\n      remarkable cannot be accidental brewster takes no notice of it\r\n      whatever beyond a mere statement we believe that such is the\r\n      fact the early writers of treatises on the automaton seem not\r\n      to have observed the matter at all and have no reference to it\r\n      the author of the pamphlet alluded to by brewster mentions it\r\n      but acknowledges his inability to account for it yet it is\r\n      obviously from such prominent discrepancies or incongruities as\r\n      this that deductions are to be made if made at all which shall\r\n      lead us to the truth\r\n\r\n      the circumstance of the automatons playing with his left hand\r\n      cannot have connexion with the operations of the machine\r\n      considered merely as such any mechanical arrangement which would\r\n      cause the figure to move in any given manner the left\r\n      armcould if reversed cause it to move in the same manner the\r\n      right but these principles cannot be extended to the human\r\n      organization wherein there is a marked and radical difference in\r\n      the construction and at all events in the powers of the right\r\n      and left arms reflecting upon this latter fact we naturally\r\n      refer the incongruity noticeable in the chessplayer to this\r\n      peculiarity in the human organization if so we must imagine\r\n      some reversionfor the chessplayer plays precisely as a man\r\n      would not these ideas once entertained are sufficient of\r\n      themselves to suggest the notion of a man in the interior a few\r\n      more imperceptible steps lead us finally to the result the\r\n      automaton plays with his left arm because under no other\r\n      circumstances could the man within play with his righta\r\n      desideratum of course let us for example imagine the\r\n      automaton to play with his right arm to reach the machinery\r\n      which moves the arm and which we have before explained to lie\r\n      just beneath the shoulder it would be necessary for the man\r\n      within either to use his right arm in an exceedingly painful and\r\n      awkward position viz brought up close to his body and tightly\r\n      compressed between his body and the side of the automaton or\r\n      else to use his left arm brought across his breast in neither\r\n      case could he act with the requisite ease or precision on the\r\n      contrary the automaton playing as it actually does with the\r\n      left arm all difficulties vanish the right arm of the man\r\n      within is brought across his breast and his right fingers act\r\n      without any constraint upon the machinery in the shoulder of the\r\n      figure\r\n\r\n      we do not believe that any reasonable objections can be urged\r\n      against this solution of the automaton chessplayer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe power of words\r\n\r\n\r\n      oinos pardon agathos the weakness of a spirit

what you hinted\r\n      to me just now of the modes or of the method of what during\r\n      mortality we were accustomed to call creation do you mean to\r\n      say that the creator is not god\r\n\r\n      agathos i mean to say that the deity does not create\r\n\r\n      oinos explain\r\n\r\n      agathos in the beginning only he created the seeming creatures\r\n      which are now throughout the universe so perpetually springing\r\n      into being can only be considered as the mediate or indirect\r\n      not as the direct or immediate results of the divine creative\r\n      power\r\n\r\n      oinos among men my agathos this idea would be considered\r\n      heretical in the extreme\r\n\r\n      agathos among angels my oinos it is seen to be simply true\r\n\r\n      oinos i can comprehend you thus farthat certain operations of\r\n      what we term nature or the natural laws will under certain\r\n      conditions give rise to that which has all the appearance of\r\n      creation shortly before the final overthrow of the earth there\r\n      were i well remember many very successful experiments in what\r\n      some philosophers were weak enough to denominate the creation of\r\n      animalculæ\r\n\r\n      agathos the cases of which you speak were in fact instances of\r\n      the secondary creationand of the only species of creation which\r\n      has ever been since the first word spoke into existence the\r\n      first law\r\n\r\n      oinos are not the starry worlds that from the abyss of\r\n      nonentity burst hourly forth into the heavensare not these\r\n      stars agathos the immediate handiwork of the king\r\n\r\n      agathos let me endeavor my oinos to lead you step by step to\r\n      the conception i intend you are well aware that as no thought\r\n      can perish so no act is without infinite result we moved our\r\n      hands for example when we were dwellers on the earth and in\r\n      so doing gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it\r\n      this vibration was indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to\r\n      every particle of the earths air which thenceforward and for\r\n      ever was actuated by the one movement of the hand this fact the\r\n      mathematicians of our globe well knew they made the special\r\n      effects indeed wrought in the fluid by special impulses the\r\n      subject of exact calculationso that it became easy to determine\r\n      in what precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle\r\n      the orb and impress for ever every atom of the atmosphere\r\n      circumambient retrograding they found no difficulty from a\r\n      given effect under given conditions in determining the value of\r\n      the original impulse now the mathematicians who saw that the\r\n      results of any given impulse were absolutely endlessand who saw\r\n      that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through\r\n      the agency of algebraic analysiswho saw too the facility of\r\n      the retrogradationthese men saw at the same time that this\r\n      species of analysis itself had within itself a capacity for\r\n      indefinite progressthat there were no bounds conceivable to its\r\n      advancement and applicability except within the intellect of him\r\n      who advanced or applied it but at this point our mathematicians\r\n      paused\r\n\r\n      oinos and why agathos should they have proceeded\r\n\r\n      agathos because there were some considerations of deep interest\r\n      beyond it was deducible from what they knew that to a being of\r\n      infinite understandingone to whom the perfection of the\r\n      algebraic analysis lay unfoldedthere could be no difficulty in\r\n      tracing every impulse given the airand the ether through the\r\n      airto the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote\r\n      epoch of time it is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse\r\n      given the air must in the end impress every individual thing\r\n      that exists within the universeand the being of infinite\r\n      understandingthe being whom we have imaginedmight trace the\r\n      remote undulations of the impulsetrace them upward and onward in\r\n      their influences upon all particles of an matterupward and\r\n      onward for ever in their modifications of old formsor in other\r\n      words in their creation of newuntil he found them\r\n      reflectedunimpressive at lastback from the throne of the\r\n      godhead and not only could such a thing do this but at any\r\n      epoch should a given result be afforded himshould one of these\r\n      numberless comets for example be presented to his inspectionhe\r\n      could have no difficulty in determining by the analytic\r\n      retrogradation to what original impulse it was due this power\r\n      of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfectionthis\r\n      faculty of referring at all epochs all effects to all causesis\r\n      of course the prerogative of the deity alonebut in every variety\r\n      of degree short of the absolute perfection is the power itself\r\n      exercised by the whole host of the angelic intelligences\r\n\r\n      oinos but you speak merely of impulses upon the air\r\n\r\n      agathos in speaking of the air i referred only to the earth\r\n      but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the\r\n      etherwhich since it pervades and alone pervades all space is\r\n      thus the great medium of creation\r\n\r\n      oinos then all motion of whatever nature creates\r\n\r\n      agathos it must but a true philosophy has long taught that the\r\n      source of all motion is thoughtand the source of all thought is\r\n\r\n      oinos god\r\n\r\n      agathos

that one or two of the\r\n      wise among our forefatherswise in fact although not in the\r\n      worlds esteemhad ventured to doubt the propriety of the term\r\n      improvement as applied to the progress of our civilization\r\n      there were periods in each of the five or six centuries\r\n      immediately preceding our dissolution when arose some vigorous\r\n      intellect boldly contending for those principles whose truth\r\n      appears now to our disenfranchised reason so utterly\r\n      obviousprinciples which should have taught our race to submit to\r\n      the guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their\r\n      control at long intervals some masterminds appeared looking\r\n      upon each advance in practical science as a retrogradation in\r\n      the true utility occasionally the poetic intellectthat\r\n      intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of\r\n      allsince those truths which to us were of the most enduring\r\n      importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in\r\n      proof tones to the imagination alone and to the unaided reason\r\n      bears no weightoccasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a\r\n      step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the\r\n      philosophic and find in the mystic parable that tells of the\r\n      tree of knowledge and of its forbidden fruit deathproducing a\r\n      distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the\r\n      infant condition of his soul and these menthe poetsliving and\r\n      perishing amid the scorn of the utilitariansof rough pedants\r\n      who arrogated to themselves a title which could have been\r\n      properly applied only to the scornedthese men the poets\r\n      pondered piningly yet not unwisely upon the ancient days when\r\n      our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keendays\r\n      when mirth was a word unknown so solemnly deeptoned was\r\n

his own fancy an\r\n      infantine imbecility came over him as might be supposed from the\r\n      origin of his disorder he grew infected with system and with\r\n      abstraction he enwrapped himself in generalities among other\r\n      odd ideas that of universal equality gained ground and in the\r\n      face of analogy and of godin despite of the loud warning voice\r\n      of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in\r\n      earth and heavenwild attempts at an omniprevalent democracy\r\n      were made yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading\r\n      evilknowledge man could not both know and succumb meantime\r\n      huge smoking cities arose innumerable green leaves shrank\r\n      before the hot breath of furnaces the fair face of nature was\r\n      deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome disease and\r\n      methinks sweet una even our slumbering sense of the forced and\r\n      of the farfetched might have arrested us here but now it\r\n      appears that we had worked out our own destruction in the\r\n      perversion of our taste or rather in the blind neglect of its\r\n      culture in the schools for in truth it was at this crisis that\r\n      taste alonethat faculty which holding a middle position between\r\n      the pure intellect and the moral sense could never safely have\r\n      been disregardedit was now that taste alone could have led us\r\n      gently back to beauty to nature and to life but alas for the\r\n      pure contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of plato alas\r\n      for the μουσικη which he justly regarded as an allsufficient\r\n      education for the soul alas for him and for itsince both were\r\n      most desperately needed when both were most entirely forgotten or\r\n      despised \r\n\r\n      pascal a philosopher whom we both love has said how\r\n      trulyque tout notre raisonnement se rèduit à céder au\r\n      sentiment and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the\r\n      natural had time permitted it would have regained its old\r\n      ascendancy over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools but\r\n      this thing was not to be prematurely induced by intemperance of\r\n      knowledge the old age of the world drew on this the mass of\r\n      mankind saw not or living lustily although unhappily affected\r\n      not to see but for myself the earths records had taught me to\r\n      look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization i had\r\n      imbibed a prescience of our fate from comparison of china the\r\n      simple and enduring with assyria the architect with egypt the\r\n      astrologer with nubia more crafty than either the turbulent\r\n      mother of all arts in history  of these regions i met with a\r\n      ray from the future the individual artificialities of the three\r\n      latter were local diseases of the earth and in their individual\r\n      overthrows we had seen local remedies applied but for the\r\n      infected world at large i could anticipate no regeneration save\r\n      in death that man as a race should not become extinct i saw\r\n      that he must be born again\r\n\r\n      and now it was fairest and dearest that we wrapped our spirits\r\n      daily in dreams now it was that in twilight we discoursed of\r\n      the days to come when the artscarred surface of the earth\r\n      having undergone that purification  which alone could efface\r\n      its rectangular obscenities should clothe itself anew in the\r\n      verdure and the mountainslopes and the smiling waters of\r\n      paradise and be rendered at length a fit dwellingplace for\r\n      manfor man the death purgedfor man to whose now exalted\r\n      intellect there should be poison in knowledge no morefor the\r\n      redeemed regenerated blissful and now immortal but still for\r\n      the material man\r\n\r\n      una well do i remember these conversations dear monos but\r\n      the epoch of the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we\r\n      believed and as the corruption you indicate did surely warrant\r\n      us in believing men lived and died individually you yourself\r\n      sickened and passed into the grave and thither your constant\r\n      una speedily followed you and though the century which has since\r\n      elapsed and whose conclusion brings us thus together once more\r\n      tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience of duration\r\n      yet my monos it was a century still\r\n\r\n      monos say rather a point in the vague infinity\r\n      unquestionably it was in the earths dotage that i died wearied\r\n      at heart with anxieties which had their origin in the general\r\n      turmoil and decay i succumbed to the fierce fever after some\r\n      few days of pain and many of dreamy delirium replete with\r\n      ecstasy the manifestations of which you mistook for pain while\r\n      i longed but was impotent to undeceive youafter some days there\r\n      came upon me as you have said a breathless and motionless\r\n      torpor and this was termed death by those who stood around me\r\n\r\n      words are vague things my condition did not deprive me of\r\n      sentience it appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the\r\n      extreme quiescence of him who having slumbered long and\r\n      profoundly lying motionless and fully prostrate in a midsummer\r\n      noon begins to steal slowly back into consciousness through the\r\n      mere sufficiency of his sleep and without being awakened by\r\n      external disturbances\r\n\r\n      i breathed no longer the pulses were still the heart had ceased\r\n      to beat volition had not departed but was powerless the senses\r\n      were unusually active although eccentrically soassuming often\r\n      each others functions at random the taste and the smell were\r\n      inextricably confounded and became one sentiment abnormal and\r\n      intense the rosewater with which your tenderness had moistened\r\n      my lips to the last affected me with sweet fancies of\r\n      flowersfantastic flowers far more lovely than any of the old\r\n      earth but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us the\r\n      eyelids transparent and bloodless offered no complete\r\n      impediment to vision as volition was in abeyance the balls\r\n      could not roll in their sockets but all objects within the range\r\n      of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less\r\n      distinctness the rays which fell upon the external retina or\r\n      into the corner of the eye producing a more vivid effect than\r\n      those which struck the front or interior surface yet in the\r\n      former instance this effect was so far anomalous that i\r\n      appreciated it only as soundsound sweet or discordant as the\r\n      matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in\r\n      shadecurved or angular in outline the hearing at the same\r\n      time although excited in degree was not irregular in\r\n      actionestimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision\r\n      not less than of sensibility touch had undergone a modification\r\n      more peculiar its impressions were tardily received but\r\n      pertinaciously retained and resulted always in the highest\r\n      physical pleasure thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon\r\n      my eyelids at first only recognised through vision at length\r\n      long after their removal filled my whole being with a sensual\r\n      delight immeasurable i say with a sensual delight all my\r\n      perceptions were purely sensual the materials furnished the\r\n      passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree wrought\r\n      into shape by the deceased understanding of pain there was some\r\n      little of pleasure there was much but of moral pain or pleasure\r\n      none at all thus your wild sobs floated into my ear with all\r\n      their mournful cadences and were appreciated in their every\r\n      variation of sad tone but they were soft musical sounds and no\r\n      more they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the\r\n      sorrows which gave them birth while the large and constant tears\r\n      which fell upon my face telling the bystanders of a heart which\r\n      broke thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone and\r\n      this was in truth the death of which these bystanders spoke\r\n      reverently in low whispersyou sweet una gaspingly with loud\r\n      cries\r\n\r\n      they attired me for the coffinthree or four dark figures which\r\n      flitted busily to and fro as these crossed the direct line of my\r\n      vision they affected me as forms but upon passing to my side\r\n      their images impressed me with the idea of shrieks groans and\r\n      other dismal expressions of terror of horror or of wo you\r\n      alone habited in a white robe passed in all directions\r\n      musically about me\r\n\r\n      the day waned and as its light faded away i became possessed\r\n      by a vague uneasinessan anxiety such as the sleeper feels when\r\n      sad real sounds fall continuously within his earlow distant\r\n      belltones solemn at long but equal intervals and mingling\r\n      with melancholy dreams night arrived and with its shadows a\r\n      heavy discomfort it oppressed my limbs with the oppression of\r\n      some dull weight and was palpable there was also a moaning\r\n      sound not unlike the distant reverberation of surf but more\r\n      continuous which beginning with the first twilight had grown\r\n      in strength with the darkness suddenly lights were brought into\r\n      the room and this reverberation became forthwith interrupted\r\n      into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound but less dreary\r\n      and less distinct the ponderous oppression was in a great\r\n      measure relieved and issuing from the flame of each lamp for\r\n      there were many there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain\r\n      of melodious monotone and when now dear una approaching the\r\n      bed upon which i lay outstretched you sat gently by my side\r\n      breathing odor from your sweet lips and pressing them upon my\r\n      brow there arose tremulously within my bosom and mingling with\r\n      the merely physical sensations which circumstances had called\r\n      forth a something akin to sentiment itselfa feeling that half\r\n      appreciating half responded to your earnest love and sorrow but\r\n      this feeling took no root in the pulseless heart and seemed\r\n      indeed rather a shadow than a reality and faded quickly away\r\n      first into extreme quiescence and then into a purely sensual\r\n      pleasure as before\r\n\r\n      and now from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses there\r\n      appeared to have arisen within me a sixth all perfect in its\r\n      exercise i found a wild delightyet a delight still physical\r\n      inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part motion in the\r\n      animal frame had fully ceased no muscle quivered no nerve\r\n      thrilled no artery throbbed but there seemed to have sprung up\r\n      in the brain that of which no words could convey to the merely\r\n      human intelligence even an indistinct conception let me term it\r\n      a mental pendulous pulsation it was the moral embodiment of\r\n      mans abstract idea of time by the absolute equalization of this\r\n      movementor of such as thishad the cycles of the firmamental\r\n      orbs themselves been adjusted by its aid i measured the\r\n      irregularities of the clock upon the mantel and of the watches\r\n      of the attendants their tickings came sonorously to my ears the\r\n      slightest deviations from the true proportionand these\r\n      deviations were omniprevalentaffected me just as violations of\r\n      abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense\r\n      although no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the\r\n      individual seconds accurately together yet i had no difficulty\r\n      in holding steadily in mind the tones and the respective\r\n      momentary errors of each and thisthis keen perfect\r\n      selfexisting sentiment of durationthis sentiment existing as\r\n      man could not possibly have conceived it to exist independently\r\n      of any succession of eventsthis ideathis sixth sense\r\n      upspringing from the ashes of the rest was the first obvious and\r\n      certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of the\r\n      temporal eternity\r\n\r\n      it was midnight and you still sat by my side all others had\r\n      departed from the chamber of death they had deposited me in the\r\n      coffin the lamps burned flickeringly for this i knew by the\r\n      tremulousness of the monotonous strains but suddenly these\r\n      strains diminished in distinctness and in volume finally they\r\n      ceased the perfume in my nostrils died away forms affected my\r\n      vision no longer the oppression of the darkness uplifted itself\r\n      from my bosom a dull shock like that of electricity pervaded my\r\n      frame and was followed by total loss of the idea of contact all\r\n      of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole consciousness\r\n      of entity and in the one abiding sentiment of duration the\r\n      mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the\r\n      deadly decay\r\n\r\n      yet had not all of sentience departed for the consciousness and\r\n      the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a\r\n      lethargic intuition i appreciated the direful change now in\r\n      operation upon the flesh and as the dreamer is sometimes aware\r\n      of the bodily presence of one who leans over him so sweet una\r\n      i still dully felt that you sat by my side so too when the\r\n      noon of the second day came i was not unconscious of those\r\n      movements which displaced you from my side which confined me\r\n      within the coffin which deposited me within the hearse which\r\n      bore me to the grave which lowered me within it which heaped\r\n      heavily the mould upon me and which thus left me in blackness\r\n      and corruption to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm\r\n\r\n      and here in the prisonhouse which has few secrets to disclose\r\n      there rolled away days and weeks and months and the soul watched\r\n      narrowly each second as it flew and without effort took record\r\n      of its flightwithout effort and without object\r\n\r\n      a year passed the consciousness of being had grown hourly more\r\n      indistinct and that of mere locality had in great measure\r\n      usurped its position the idea of entity was becoming merged in\r\n      that of place the narrow space immediately surrounding what had\r\n      been the body was now growing to be the body itself at length\r\n      as often happens to the sleeper by sleep and its world alone is\r\n      death imagedat length as sometimes happened on earth to the\r\n      deep slumberer when some flitting light half startled him into\r\n      awaking yet left him half enveloped in dreamsso to me in the\r\n      strict embrace of the shadow came that light which alone might\r\n      have had power to startlethe light of enduring love men toiled\r\n      at the grave in which i lay darkling they upthrew the damp\r\n      earth upon my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of\r\n      una\r\n\r\n      and now again all was void that nebulous light had been\r\n      extinguished that feeble thrill had vibrated itself into\r\n      quiescence many lustra had supervened dust had returned to\r\n      dust the worm had food no more the sense of being had at length\r\n      utterly departed and there reigned in its steadinstead of all\r\n      thingsdominant and perpetualthe autocrats place and time for\r\n      that which was notfor that which had no formfor that which had\r\n

converse of familiar things in the old familiar language of the\r\n      world which has so fearfully perished\r\n\r\n      eiros\r\n      most fearfully fearfullythis is indeed no dream\r\n\r\n

sorrow over your\r\n      household\r\n\r\n      charmion\r\n      and that last hourspeak of it remember that beyond the naked\r\n      fact of the catastrophe itself i know nothing when coming out\r\n      from among mankind i passed into night through the graveat that\r\n      period if i remember aright the calamity which overwhelmed you\r\n      was utterly unanticipated but indeed i knew little of the\r\n      speculative philosophy of the day\r\n\r\n      eiros\r\n      the individual calamity was as you say entirely unanticipated\r\n      but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion\r\n      with astronomers i need scarce tell you my friend that even\r\n      when you left us men had agreed to understand those passages in\r\n      the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of\r\n      all things by fire as having reference to the orb of the earth\r\n      alone but in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin\r\n      speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical\r\n      knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of\r\n      flame the very moderate density of these bodies had been well\r\n      established they had been observed to pass among the satellites\r\n      of jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration either\r\n      in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets we had\r\n      long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable\r\n      tenuity and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our\r\n      substantial globe even in the event of contact but contact was\r\n      not in any degree dreaded for the elements of all the comets\r\n      were accurately known that among them we should look for the\r\n      agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many\r\n      years considered an inadmissible idea but wonders and wild\r\n      fancies had been of late days strangely rife among mankind\r\n      and although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual\r\n      apprehension prevailed upon the announcement by astronomers of a\r\n      new comet yet this announcement was generally received with i\r\n      know not what of agitation and mistrust\r\n\r\n      the elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated and\r\n      it was at once conceded by all observers that its path at\r\n      perihelion would bring it into very close proximity with the\r\n      earth there were two or three astronomers of secondary note\r\n      who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable i cannot\r\n      very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the\r\n      people for a few short days they would not believe an assertion\r\n      which their intellect so long employed among worldly\r\n      considerations could not in any manner grasp but the truth of a\r\n      vitally important fact soon makes its way into the understanding\r\n      of even the most stolid finally all men saw that astronomical\r\n      knowledge lied not and they awaited the comet its approach was\r\n      not at first seemingly rapid nor was its appearance of very\r\n      unusual character it was of a dull red and had little\r\n      perceptible train for seven or eight days we saw no material\r\n      increase in its apparent diameter and but a partial alteration\r\n      in its color meantime the ordinary affairs of men were\r\n      discarded and all interests absorbed in a growing discussion\r\n      instituted by the philosophic in respect to the cometary nature\r\n      even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to\r\n      such considerations the learned now gave their intellecttheir\r\n      soulto no such points as the allaying of fear or to the\r\n      sustenance of loved theory they soughtthey panted for right\r\n      views they groaned for perfected knowledge truth arose in the\r\n      purity of her strength and exceeding majesty and the wise bowed\r\n      down and adored\r\n\r\n      that material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would\r\n      result from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly\r\n      lost ground among the wise and the wise were now freely\r\n      permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd it was\r\n      demonstrated that the density of the comets nucleus was far\r\n      less than that of our rarest gas and the harmless passage of a\r\n      similar visitor among the satellites of jupiter was a point\r\n      strongly insisted upon and which served greatly to allay terror\r\n      theologists with an earnestness fearenkindled dwelt upon the\r\n      biblical prophecies and expounded them to the people with a\r\n      directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been\r\n      known that the final destruction of the earth must be brought\r\n      about by the agency of fire was urged with a spirit that\r\n      enforced every where conviction and that the comets were of no\r\n      fiery nature as all men now knew was a truth which relieved\r\n      all in a great measure from the apprehension of the great\r\n      calamity foretold it is noticeable that the popular prejudices\r\n      and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and warserrors which\r\n      were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a cometwere now\r\n      altogether unknown as if by some sudden convulsive exertion\r\n      reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne the\r\n      feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive interest\r\n\r\n      what minor evils might arise from the contact were points of\r\n      elaborate question the learned spoke of slight geological\r\n      disturbances of probable alterations in climate and\r\n      consequently in vegetation of possible magnetic and electric\r\n      influences many held that no visible or perceptible effect would\r\n      in any manner be produced while such discussions were going on\r\n      their subject gradually approached growing larger in apparent\r\n      diameter and of a more brilliant lustre mankind grew paler as\r\n      it came all human operations were suspended\r\n\r\n      there was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when\r\n      the comet had attained at length a size surpassing that of any\r\n      previously recorded visitation the people now dismissing any\r\n      lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong experienced all\r\n      the certainty of evil the chimerical aspect of their terror was\r\n      gone the hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently\r\n      within their bosoms a very few days sufficed however to merge\r\n      even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable we could no\r\n      longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts its\r\n      historical attributes had disappeared it oppressed us with a\r\n      hideous novelty of emotion we saw it not as an astronomical\r\n      phenomenon in the heavens but as an incubus upon our hearts and\r\n      a shadow upon our brains it had taken with inconceivable\r\n      rapidity the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame\r\n      extending from horizon to horizon\r\n\r\n      yet a day and men breathed with greater freedom it was clear\r\n      that we were already within the influence of the comet yet we\r\n      lived we even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity\r\n      of mind the exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was\r\n      apparent for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through\r\n      it meantime our vegetation had perceptibly altered and we\r\n      gained faith from this predicted circumstance in the foresight\r\n      of the wise a wild luxuriance of foliage utterly unknown\r\n      before burst out upon every vegetable thing\r\n\r\n      yet another dayand the evil was not altogether upon us it was\r\n      now evident that its nucleus would first reach us a wild change\r\n      had come over all men and the first sense of pain was the wild\r\n      signal for general lamentation and horror this first sense of\r\n      pain lay in a rigorous constriction of the breast and lungs and\r\n      an insufferable dryness of the skin it could not be denied that\r\n      our atmosphere was radically affected the conformation of this\r\n      atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be\r\n      subjected were now the topics of discussion the result of\r\n      investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror\r\n      through the universal heart of man\r\n\r\n      it had been long known that the air which encircled us was a\r\n      compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases in the proportion of\r\n      twentyone measures of oxygen and seventynine of nitrogen in\r\n      every one hundred of the atmosphere oxygen which was the\r\n      principle of combustion and the vehicle of heat was absolutely\r\n      necessary to the support of animal life and was the most\r\n      powerful and energetic agent in nature nitrogen on the\r\n      contrary was incapable of supporting either animal life or\r\n      flame an unnatural excess of oxygen would result it had been\r\n      ascertained in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we\r\n      had latterly experienced it was the pursuit the extension of\r\n      the idea which had engendered awe what would be the result of a\r\n      total extraction of the nitrogen a combustion irresistible\r\n      alldevouring omniprevalent immediatethe entire fulfilment\r\n      in all their minute and terrible details of the fiery and\r\n      horrorinspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the holy\r\n      book\r\n\r\n      why need i paint charmion the now disenchained frenzy of\r\n      mankind that tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired\r\n      us with hope was now the source of the bitterness of despair in\r\n      its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the\r\n      consummation of fate meantime a day again passedbearing away\r\n      with it the last shadow of hope we gasped in the rapid\r\n      modification of the air the red blood bounded tumultuously\r\n      through its strict channels a furious delirium possessed all\r\n      men and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening\r\n      heavens they trembled and shrieked aloud but the nucleus of the\r\n      destroyer was now upon us even here in aidenn i shudder while i\r\n      speak let me be briefbrief as the ruin that overwhelmed for a\r\n      moment there was a wild lurid light alone visiting and\r\n      penetrating all things thenlet us bow down charmion before\r\n      the excessive majesty of the great godthen there came a\r\n      shouting and pervading sound as if from the mouth itself of him\r\n      while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed\r\n      burst at once into a species of intense flame for whose\r\n      surpassing brilliancy and allfervid heat even the angels in the\r\n      high heaven of pure knowledge have no name thus ended all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshadowa parable\r\n\r\n\r\nyea though i walk through the valley of the shadow\r\n                    psalm of david\r\n\r\n      ye who read are still among the living but i who write shall\r\n      have long since gone my way into the region of shadows for\r\n      indeed strange things shall happen and secret things be known\r\n      and many centuries shall pass away ere these memorials be seen\r\n      of men and when seen there will be some to disbelieve and\r\n      some to doubt and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in\r\n      the characters here graven with a stylus of iron\r\n\r\n      the year had been a year of terror and of feelings more intense\r\n      than terror for which there is no name upon the earth for many\r\n      prodigies and signs had taken place and far and wide over sea\r\n      and land the black wings of the pestilence were spread abroad\r\n      to those nevertheless cunning in the stars it was not unknown\r\n      that the heavens wore an aspect of ill and to me the greek\r\n      oinos among others it was evident that now had arrived the\r\n      alternation of that seven hundred and ninetyfourth year when at\r\n      the entrance of aries the planet jupiter is conjoined with the\r\n      red ring of the terrible saturnus the peculiar spirit of the\r\n      skies if i mistake not greatly made itself manifest not only\r\n      in the physical orb of the earth but in the souls imaginations\r\n      and meditations of mankind\r\n\r\n      over some flasks of the red chian wine within the walls of a\r\n      noble hall in a dim city called ptolemais we sat at night a\r\n      company of seven and to our chamber there was no entrance save\r\n      by a lofty door of brass and the door was fashioned by the\r\n      artisan corinnos and being of rare workmanship was fastened\r\n      from within black draperies likewise in the gloomy room shut\r\n      out from our view the moon the lurid stars and the peopleless\r\n      streetsbut the boding and the memory of evil they would not be\r\n      so excluded there were things around us and about of which i can\r\n      render no distinct accountthings material and\r\n      spiritualheaviness in the atmospherea sense of\r\n      suffocationanxietyand above all that terrible state of\r\n      existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly\r\n      living and awake and meanwhile the powers of thought lie\r\n      dormant a dead weight hung upon us it hung upon our limbsupon\r\n      the household furnitureupon the goblets from which we drank and\r\n      all things were depressed and borne down therebyall things save\r\n      only the flames of the seven lamps which illumined our revel\r\n      uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light they thus\r\n      remained burning all pallid and motionless and in the mirror\r\n      which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which\r\n      we sat each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own\r\n      countenance and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his\r\n      companions yet we laughed and were merry in our proper waywhich\r\n      was hysterical and sang the songs of anacreonwhich are madness\r\n      and drank deeplyalthough the purple wine reminded us of blood\r\n      for there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of\r\n      young zoilus dead and at full length he lay enshrouded the\r\n      genius and the demon of the scene alas he bore no portion in\r\n      our mirth save that his countenance distorted with the plague\r\n      and his eyes in which death had but half extinguished the fire\r\n      of the pestilence seemed to take such interest in our merriment\r\n      as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to\r\n      die but although i oinos felt that the eyes of the departed\r\n      were upon me still i forced myself not to perceive the\r\n      bitterness of their expression and gazing down steadily into the\r\n      depths of the ebony mirror sang with a loud and sonorous voice\r\n      the songs of the son of teios but gradually my songs they\r\n      ceased and their echoes rolling afar off among the sable\r\n      draperies of the chamber became weak and undistinguishable and\r\n      so faded away and lo from among those sable draperies where the\r\n      sounds of the song departed there came forth a dark and\r\n      undefined shadowa shadow such as the moon when low in heaven\r\n      might fashion from the figure of a man but it was the shadow\r\n      neither of man nor of god nor of any familiar thing and\r\n      quivering awhile among the draperies of the room it at length\r\n      rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass but\r\n      the shadow was vague and formless and indefinite and was the\r\n      shadow neither of man nor of godneither god of greece nor god\r\n      of chaldaea nor any egyptian god and the shadow rested upon the\r\n      brazen doorway and under the arch of the entablature of the\r\n      door and moved not nor spoke any word but there became\r\n      stationary and remained and the door whereupon the shadow rested\r\n      was if i remember aright over against the feet of the young\r\n      zoilus enshrouded but we the seven there assembled having seen\r\n      the shadow as it came out from among the draperies dared not\r\n      steadily behold it but cast down our eyes and gazed continually\r\n      into the depths of the mirror of ebony and at length i oinos\r\n      speaking some low words demanded of the shadow its dwelling and\r\n      its appellation and the shadow answered i am shadow and my\r\n      dwelling is near to the catacombs of ptolemais and hard by those\r\n      dim plains of helusion which border upon the foul charonian\r\n      canal and then did we the seven start from our seats in\r\n      horror and stand trembling and shuddering and aghast for the\r\n      tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one\r\n      being but of a multitude of beings and varying in their\r\n      cadences from syllable to syllable fell duskly upon our ears in\r\n      the wellremembered and familiar accents of many thousand\r\n      departed friends\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nend of the project gutenberg ebook of
