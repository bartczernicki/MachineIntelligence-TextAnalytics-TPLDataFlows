HTML version by Al Haines.  *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RAVEN ***     The Raven   by  Edgar Allan Poe     Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,   Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—   While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,   As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.   “’Tis some visiter,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—                                      Only this and nothing more.”    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,   And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.   Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow   From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—   For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—                                      Nameless here for evermore.    And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain   Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;   So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating   “’Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door—   Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;                                      This it is and nothing more.”    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,   “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;   But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,   And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,   That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door—                                      Darkness there and nothing more.    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,   Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;   But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,   And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”   This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—                                      Merely this and nothing more.    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,   Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.   “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;   Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore—   Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—                                      ’Tis the wind and nothing more.”    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,   In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.   Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he,   But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—   Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—                                      Perched, and sat, and nothing more.    Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,   By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,   “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,   Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—   Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”                                      Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,   Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;   For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being   Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—   Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,                                      With such name as “Nevermore.”    But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only   That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour   Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered—   Till I scarcely more than muttered: “Other friends have flown before—   On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”                                      Then the bird said “Nevermore.”    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,   “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,   Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster   Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—   Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore                                      Of ‘Never—nevermore.’”    But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,   Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;   Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking   Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—   What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore                                      Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing   To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;   This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining   On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,   But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er                                      _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer   Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.   “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee   Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!   Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”                                      Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—   Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,   Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—   On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—   Is there—_is_ there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”                                      Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!   By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—   Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,   It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—   Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”                                      Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”    “Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—   “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!   Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken!   Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!   Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”                                      Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting   On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;   And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming   And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor;   And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor                                      Shall be lifted—nevermore!     *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RAVEN ***  Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate  Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org  This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

craven   ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore   tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore                                      quoth the raven nevermore    much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly   though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore   for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being   ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door   bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door                                      with such name as nevermore    but the raven sitting lonely on that placid bust spoke only   that one word as if its soul in that one word he did outpour   nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered   till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before   on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before                                      then the bird said nevermore    startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken   doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store   caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster   followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore   till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore                                      of nevernevermore    but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into
